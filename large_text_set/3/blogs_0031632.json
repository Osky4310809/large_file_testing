Healthy ingredients, small batch makers, ethical employment values, philanthropic initiatives — the list goes on, but my favorite thing about the natural beauty industry is how many of these new and established companies are founded, owned, and operated by women. I always love to read these women's bios, and after a while I began to notice a few common themes among many of their origin stories: illness, be it of the founder herself or an illness of one of her loved ones; leaving behind a “big” corporate career to work for oneself; and a desire for healthier choices for all. Most of these founders learned one way or another that their conventional beauty products contained harmful ingredients and made it their personal mission to create something safer, and share their discoveries with the world. Meryl Marshall created Hynt Beauty along with her husband, Craig. “After my breast cancer treatment in 2005, I started to question all the products that I used daily. I started to seek out safer versions of cleaning products, food, and cosmetics. I did my research and investigated what was currently in my makeup bag. I began googling individual ingredients listed on labels and boxes and my stomach turned. That was my ‘aha’ moment.\" Marshall is far from alone. I had the pleasure of talking with several women who started their own green beauty companies and continue to build businesses focused on wellness, transparency, and luxury, all the while balancing life with work, i.e. living the dream. “I left a 20-year career as a fashion buyer for our family retail store that my husband and I own, because I was so passionate about clean skincare,” says Andrea Pierce-Naymon. “Even though I still have a foot in the door and help with the buying as I train my assistant to take over, I’m thinking about OY-L 24/7.” She founded OY-L recently, inspired by her daughter’s health struggle with POTS, a neurological disorder where blood cannot get to the brain fast enough because there’s not enough blood volume. People suffering from PTOS need high levels of salt in their body to increase that volume, which is why Pierce-Naymon donates 15 percent of all her salt-based products to Dysautonomia International . Running an indie beauty business requires these women to wear many hats: They are scientists, chemists, pharmacists, and formulators; marketing experts, PR advocates, social media mavens. (And the whole family is often involved: Pierce-Naymon’s college-aged daughter does the brand’s social media.) They manage teams but also stay up late hand-filling glass bottles full of carefully-sourced serums. Many answer client or customer questions at all hours, personally. Years ago, I wrote to RMS Beauty with a product question and got a fast response from founder Rose-Marie Swift (shown below), offering to meet up with me in person for a lesson on how to work with the product. And this was before I was a beauty writer; I had reached out simply as an average customer. Why does this particular industry attract such hands-on and helpful people? Perhaps it has to do with why these women started their companies in the first place. Rarely is it because they wanted to make a ton of money. “It's about our customers,” says Susanne Norwitz, founder of Maya Chia . “When a person takes the time out of their life to write us a heartfelt note about how one of our products transformed their skin, it means everything, it is the reason we do what we do. It may seem superficial to talk about skin so dramatically, but how we feel about our skin affects the way we navigate this world and carry ourselves in it, at a very profound and fundamental level. We love nothing more than to talk with our customers directly — that's what inspires our creativity to innovate and to be better.” So the rewards for brand owners clearly go above and beyond the financial, but how does one sustain her own business in a tough economy? Swift had reservations about starting her own brand, which she did after she launched her successful clean beauty website, www.beautytruth.com, in 2004, and was inundated with requests from the public on what they should use product-wise to be more green. She researched and studied and created RMS Beauty . But it was a leap of faith back then, before green beauty was widespread and taken seriously in the beauty industry. “My fear was losing my money, as I finance it completely by myself.” She recalls an industry big-wig dismissing her idea, brushing it off with a brisk, “Who the hell is going to buy organic makeup?” As we now know, the answer to that is lots. “People have been educating themselves and social media needs to be thanked for that,” Swift says. The consumer now has the means to recognize high quality ingredients versus chemicals when they see or use them. This growing consumer awareness is catapulting the green beauty industry into major double and triple digit growth every year.” And while some civilians may assume that creating natural skincare is as easy as mixing organic oils and herbs and creating attractive labels, it requires so much more than that to be successful. “I don’t do anything on a whim with Leahlani ,” says founder Leah Klasovsky (pictured above). “Every single product has taken years to perfect before being introduced to our line.” The payoff is clear: Leahlani Skincare has grown exponentially in the past year while still maintaining that bespoke feeling and handmade quality its devotees love. “It’s almost impossible to ‘clock out’ at the end of the day. My mind is constantly turning with the endless amount of ideas that I have, emails I have to answer, fresh batches to make, deadlines…” Klasovsky worked as an aesthetician before launching her own line, and admits that losing that day-to-day work directly with her clients broke her heart. However, with her line she’s managed to make every single product feel like it was made for the individual customer who receives it — something you don't often find outside of an indie company like Leahlani, where so much thought and love and, as they say in Hawaii, aloha , has gone into development. That hand-made vibe isn’t the goal for every single green brand, though. Nu Evolution Cosmetics was created by Nadine Cormier Diaz and Sandra Anderson Diaz (pictured below) with a different feeling in mind. “We bench-marked our brand to hang with the top makeup artistry brands like Nars, Bobbi Brown, and Laura Mecier from a price point and aesthetic, but the differentiating feature is that Nu Evolution products are made with natural and organic ingredients.” This tactic, too, is essential for the green beauty industry. If the products aren’t similar in feel to their conventional counterparts, green beauty will lose a big portion of potential customers. With Nu Evolution, the founders managed to nail it. Their products look, feel, and perform exactly like the brands they set out to compete with. Like Ginger Rogers, dancing backwards and in heels to Fred Astaire’s grace, Nu Evolution has to be twice as good just to be considered on par. And it is. Known as “the Natural M.A.C.” in fashion industry circles, Nu Evolution is about to start their sixth season as a beauty sponsor for shows at New York Fashion Week , along with being a beauty sponsor at other fashion events in other cities in the country. Another common theme for these women in deciding to start their own green beauty companies is the elusive, all-important work-life balance. Suzanne LeRoux started One Love Organics in the summer of 2009. “There was a global recession happening and I had taken time off from my law practice to raise my two boys who were 2 and 3 years old. I had created skincare products as a hobby for about ten years and using pure plant oils changed my fussy, irritable skin for good and I wanted to bring these formulas to the market.” She remembers all the obstacles her new business faced. “It’s hard to imagine today but at the time, very few USA-based indie or green beauty brands existed. People didn’t talk about using oils or balms to moisturize or cleanse . Oils were still considered to be ‘bad.’ And, there were only a handful of retailers who sold luxury green beauty. Everyone thought we were rather crazy.” (Now, of course, we all know oils are beneficial from head to toe .) Tata Harper (pictured above), founder of one of the most successful green beauty brands, tells a similar story. “When I started my company, everyone told me luxury natural products weren’t possible, and that no one would want them. We used to have to do a lot of convincing, because people didn’t believe natural products could be truly effective. Now that the wellness movement has really exploded around the world, people are much more conscious of what they’re putting on their skin, and are much more open to natural products.” Harper makes her anti-aging products in an “open lab,” from ingredients grown on her very own farm in Vermont, where transparency is king. This is another reason people keep flocking to safe, natural beauty. They know exactly where their products are coming from and how they are made, so they feel good about the artisans, farmers, and people they support. Laurel Schaffer (shown below), founder of Laurel Whole Plant Organics , understands this, and cites it as her motivation. “Working with small artisan farmers who love their land and love growing ingredients for us is by far my biggest inspiration. You can truly feel the love in the ingredients when they arrive at our studio during harvest seasons. Farming is also not a sustainable way of life in the U.S.; harvesting tiny flowers and leaves by hand is something that is a labor of love, and is truly under-valued. We are honored to be in a position to pay these farmers what these ingredients are worth.” Trinette Reed Photography Each of these women talked about the weight of being in charge— not just of the business, but of employees, finances, product, and customer satisfaction. Being one’s own boss has pros and cons, of course, but as Stefanie Walmsley, co-founder of Prim Botanicals adds, “My stress levels have increased and the amount of sleep I get has decreased but I constantly feel energized and inspired. It’s entirely different when the energy you are putting into a business is for a business of your own. I’m certainly harder on myself than any boss has ever been on me, but I can’t imagine a more gratifying experience.” The one thing I heard over and over in talking to these trailblazers of green beauty was the recurring theme of kindness. “My ongoing inspiration for Hynt Beauty often comes from networking with this wonderful green beauty community. I have met the most incredible, creative and kindest people you can imagine,” says Marshall. Many founders listed people by name who have been kind to them, some of whom are would-be competitors who help lift each other up, rather than tear one another down, because they care about healthy beauty and understand there is room for more than one successful brand in the field. Marshall continued, “some are those who initially paved the way before ‘green’ or ‘clean’ was ever trendy and they set the foundation for others like myself to continue on the path toward a clean beauty revolution.” If it’s true that it’s the people you meet along the way who make the journey worthwhile, who make all the sweat and sacrifice seem like nothing at all, then these women have figured out the secret. They honor those who work for them. They live for helping customers and changing lives. They admire each other and seek to educate the world. They know that will only happen by working together and learning from one another. Isn’t that a perfect lesson for today’s world? Love green beauty companies?
