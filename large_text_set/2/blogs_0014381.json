Not because normally it’s not there but because that’s how we build bridges and not how we break them.” \nYet Yiannopoulos made blatant sexist comments during the interview, criticizing Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman as people who “used to be funny before they contracted feminism.” \n“You’re literally the only good [liberal],” Yiannopoulos added, before slamming Girls creator and star Lena Dunham as the poster woman for the Democratic party’s issues. “The Democrats are the party of Lena Dunham. These people are mental, hideous people, and the more that America sees of Lena Dunham, the fewer votes that the Democratic Party is going to get.” \n“Let’s not pick on fellow HBO stars,” Maher replied, drawing laughs. “There are so many other people.” \n“I hurt people for a reason,” Yiannopoulos said. “I like to think of myself as a virtuous troll.” \nYiannopoulos’ trolling made national headlines last year after he was barred from Twitter for attacking Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. During the Friday night interview, Maher brought up the Jones incident and Yiannopoulos doubled down on his hateful rhetoric against the SNL star. \n“I read a bad review of the movie. I said she look like a dude, she does. I said she’s barely literate, she is. And I simply don’t accept that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster is sitting in a Hollywood mansion crying over mean words on the Internet — get over it. Mean words on the Internet don’t hurt anyone,” he said. \nMaher countered that some people would say that Yiannopoulos has inspired real-life violence with his messaging. “Well then they would be idiots,” he replied, and at one point said to the Real Time audience, “You’re very easily triggered it’s pathetic.” \nYiannopoulos also took aim Scahill for canceling on Maher. “That silly man who had a hissy fit,” Yiannopoulos called him. “If you don’t show up to debate, you lose.” \nHe added, “Stop taking the bait, liberals. The fact that they all freaked out about an impish, British f–. You schoolgirls.” \nIn the end, Maher got the last word: “You should get off the Trump train. For a guy who loves free speech, you picked a weird boyfriend.” \nYiannopoulos’ booking on the HBO weekly talk show to promote his upcoming book, Dangerous , was considered controversial given his views which many consider sexist and racist. Earlier this month, a planned speech by Yiannopoulos at the University of California, Berkeley was canceled a couple of hours before the event “out of concern for public safety.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:49:11.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
