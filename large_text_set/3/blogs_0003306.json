Ever since Frozen proved audiences were still hankering for a good old-fashioned animated musical in a huge way, we've seen an influx of them -- from Moana to Sing to Trolls , and in live action with La La Land and even the upcoming adaptation of Beauty and the Beast . \nNow the Lego Movie wants in on some of that musical love. In an interview with Lego Batman Movie director Chris McKay, he mentioned that the sequel to The Lego Movie , currently titled The Lego Movie Sequel (in theaters February 8, 2019), is going to lean way more into music than its predecessor. \n\" Lego 2 is going to be this big musical and space action movie,\" he told the Shanlian on Batman podcast. \"They need a lot of the writing, a lot of development, not only with script development but development with songwriters. So it was very ambitious to get that movie out.‚Äù \nThat's probably part of the reason why it's not arriving in theaters until 2019, but it makes sense. The sequel will be director by Mike Mitchell, who also did Trolls , and considering the popularity of the song \"Everything Is Awesome\" from the first Lego Movie , it seems like a wise move for the film to sort of separate itself from, say, Lego Batman and Lego Ninjago (9/22/17) by going full-on musical. \nConsidering the growing popularity of Warner Bros.' Lego-branded movies, it seems like they're setting up shop in this cinematic playground for years to come. So that begs the question: what other Lego movies must we see become a reality? Like it?
