But it was the aftermath of his goal that really caught the eye. \nAs he ran towards Martial to thank the Frenchman for providing the decisive pass, he tossed his boot high in the air and completed the celebration with just one on. — Juan Mata García (@juanmata8) February 11, 2017 \nThe reason appears to be simply that it was coming off as he turned the ball into the net from close range and preferred to show his joy rather than have to deal with the mundane task of putting it back on. \nThe player acknowledged on Twitter that it was a rather unusual moment, posting a picture of him embracing his team-mates with just one shoe on. \n“Yes, I found the boot after the celebration!” he told concerned fans. \n\"My boot was half on and half off by the time I scored,\" Mata told reporters after the match. \"So when I started to celebrate it just went off and it was good advertising for Adidas.\" Juan Mata's boot came off during his goal celebration today. — Manchester United (@ManUtd) February 11, 2017 \nThe 28-year-old has enjoyed a fine season for the Red Devils, scoring six goals in 20 Premier League outings.
