Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nApple may be likely to adopt the popular Qi standard when it brings wireless charging to this year’s iPhone, but it seems that Apple isn’t abandoning reports that it could use a proprietary alternative solution. According to a new report, the company currently has not one or two, but five different groups inside Apple currently working to develop wireless charging technology for future iPhones.\nOriginally, many analysts and Apple watchers were expecting Apple to use a special wireless charging technology that would use 5GHz radio frequency signals, coupled with beam-forming, to delivery completely wireless charging, without the need for special pads. \nIt now appears that this won’t be the case , as the most recent reports suggest that Apple will use the same pad-based wireless charging tech that is used by rivals like Samsung. This would mean that Apple is simply catching up with other handsets on the wireless charging front, rather than taking the lead as hoped. \nThe rumors that Apple will adopt Qi wireless charging was made more likely recently when Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium , the group behind Qi technology. \nWhile Apple is continuing to explore alternative methods of wireless charging, however, the fact that iPhone 8 production is likely to start very soon means that it is unlikely that any of these solutions would be ready for this year’s tenth anniversary upgrade. \nAre you excited about wireless charging on the iPhone? How much of an impact would it have on your purchasing decision if Apple does stick with the existing Qi wireless charging standard?
