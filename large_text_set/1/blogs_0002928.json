It can hang on a wall or be propped up by a stand. Either way, \"the stand and speakers virtually disappearâ€”appearing as if it's floating,\" according to Sony. A rear cover can hide unsightly cords. \nThe A1E Series runs Android TV, with access to Google Play; those with Google Home can also control the TV via voice. It also has support for the Dolby Vision HDR format. \nThe A1E is powered by the 4K HDR X1 Extreme processor, which offers 40 percent more real-time processing power than its predecessor, the 4K Processor X1, Sony said. \nThe new X930E and X940E Series are also powered by the X1 Extreme, support Dolby Vision, and run Android TV. Look for a 75-inch X940E Series 4K HDR TV and 65- or 55-inch X930 E Series 4K HDR TV sets. \nThe news comes after LG today also showed off a super-slim OLED set . Its new LG Signature W (OLEDW7P) series completely does away with any electronic component attached to the panel, besides the panel itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T16:19:36.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
