Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nHouse Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy appears to have accidentally released the name of a CIA source in the midst of a back-and-forth with Democrats about how sensitive the information was and whether its presence in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email account constituted a security breach. \nGowdy’s aides blamed the State Department for the disclosure, and the agency acknowledged Monday a “human error” led to a failure to delete a name from the email in question. Story Continued Below \nThe email posted Sunday on the panel’s website included in one instance the name of “Mousa Kousa,” an alternative spelling of Moussa Koussa, a former Libyan government spy chief and foreign minister. The name appeared to have been redacted in several other instances but was included in a subject line of a forwarded email. \nThe redacted email was released at Gowdy’s direction “so the American people could decide for themselves regarding concerns about sources and methods,” the Benghazi Committee said in a statement. By Monday morning, the committee had replaced the document online with another version in which Koussa’s name does not appear. \nAsked about the change, Benghazi Committee spokesman Jamal Ware said the State Department had cleared the email for release in the form it initially appeared Sunday. \n“The State Department failed to redact a name in a subject line, so the committee took steps to remove this information so it was consistent with State Department’s redaction of it in another subject line,” Ware said Monday. “The committee will not confirm the name in question is the alleged source.” \nState Department spokesman Mark Toner confirmed Monday afternoon that State officials had missed one occurrence of Koussa’s name it had intended to delete from the email in question. \n“There was one case — I think it was just human error in our desire to get these documents to the Benghazi Committee as quickly as possible,” Toner told reporters at a regular news briefing. \nToner said the CIA had not objected to the release of the name, but State wanted it withheld for privacy reasons. \nCIA “assessed that the information in question was not classified and suggested no redactions to the documents in question,” Toner said. “We have asked the Benghazi Committee not to use the individual’s name publicly to protect that individual’s privacy. … That was our rationale behind redacting his name.” More Boots Isn’t Enough to Save Afghanistan By Jeff Eggers \nThe top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, revealed Sunday morning that the CIA had not requested the deletion of the source’s name and did not consider the information classified. Cummings said the CIA’s stance undercut Gowdy’s earlier claim that Clinton had endangered national security by having such information on her private server and by forwarding the message to one of her aides. \nIn Gowdy’s response Sunday, he said he was committed to protecting the source’s identity, even if the CIA was not. \n“Sources and methods of intelligence are among the most closely guarded information our government has,” Gowdy wrote to Cummings. “We will continue to redact that information and treat it with the highest level of confidentiality and sensitivity, and we would advise you to do the same.” \nThe CIA normally would treat the names of its alleged sources as confidential. However, Koussa’s contacts with U.S. intelligence have been publicly acknowledged for years. \nThe former spy chief defected to Britain less than two weeks after informal Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal sent Clinton the March 18, 2011, email. Blumenthal said his information on the CIA’s dependence on the source that appears to beKoussa came from former CIA officer Tyler Drumheller. Drumheller died in August. The Freedom Caucus’ Unprecedented Insurgency By Alan Greenblatt \nWhile it’s unclear how much information Koussa was giving to Western officials at the time the email was sent, the former spy chief’s role was being bandied about publicly at that time. A mention of Koussa in former CIA director George Tenet’s memoir was referenced in a New York Times story the day before Blumenthal sent the email in question to Clinton. \nIn addition to Koussa, the CIA has declassified some details of its relationship with at least two Libyan officials in the lead-up to the 2011 revolution and the NATO intervention. In a book published in May and cleared for released by his former agency, former acting CIA Director Mike Morell stated that he had a good relationship with Libyan domestic intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi and a meeting in late 2010 with the external intelligence chief, Abuzed Omar Dorda. \nThe CIA declined to comment on the information on the email or the spy agency’s relationship with the Libyan officials mentioned in the two former CIA leaders’ books. \nThe message thread Gowdy released Sunday was stamped by the State Department: \"Reviewed for sensitive information pursuant to MOU [Memorandum of Understanding].\" \nHowever, a spokesman for Cummings said the episode underscored why Gowdy should not have released the email until the State Department completed reviewing the records for public release under the FOIA process. \n”As Ranking Member Cummings stated very clearly in his letter on Sunday, even though the CIA said this information is not classified, the State Department asked Chairman Gowdy not to release this email publicly,\" the spokesman said. \nThe disclosure of Koussa’s name in the email the Benghazi panel made public appears to have been first reported Monday by Yahoo News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:26:01.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
