Well, what if I told you the best part about this clip has nothing to do with Belle singing at all? \nJust hear me out. \nIn the above clip, you can see Belle having a chat with Monsieur Jean, and she asks him if he’s “lost something again.” Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures \nIn responce to Emma Watson’s, Belle’s, question, Monsieur Jean says, \nI believe I have. Problem is, I can’t remember what. \nHaha! Hehe! So what, right? Well, if you’ve stayed with me this long, I’m about to explain to you how the above line appears to be a direct reference to “ Harry Potter .” \nSee, according to reports, the above conversation never took place in the animated, original version of “Beauty and the Beast.” In the original version, Monsieur Jean says, \nThat’s nice.
