Sanjay Dutt and Ranbir Kapoor have been posting pictures with each other at various parties and all. By Sreeju Sudhakaran | Published: February 14, 2017 1:26 pm Sanjay Dutt biopic: All you need to know about the Ranbir Kapoor film \nThere have been reports that Sanjay Dutt wasn’t too pleased with Ranbir Kapoor taking on his role in the upcoming biopic, and that even Ranbir doesn’t want to be a part of the movie anymore. However refuting all such rumours, Sanjay Dutt and Ranbir Kapoor have been posting pictures with each other at various parties and all. Like the above, where the duo goes on to the extent of twinning with each other. Apart from their black jackets, even their hairstyles is looking similar. The only thing that’s missing with Ranbir Kapoor is Sanjay Dutt’s moustache and beard. \nRanbir Kapoor has been preparing quite extensively for the project, putting up nearly 13 kilos to look the part. Reports say that he will be having three looks in the movie, based on three stages in Sanjay Dutt’s life. The movie is directed by blockbuster maker Rajkumar Hirani, and will also star Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor and Vicky Kaushal. Paresh Rawal and Manisha Koirala will be playing Ranbir’s parents, Sunil Dutt and Nargis respectively. Earlier, Sanjay Dutt wanted to play his father, but later allowed Hirani to cast Rawal in the role. \nHere’s the pic again… \nA source stated, “Sanjay has given over 200 hours of recording as a basic matter for the biopic. While Hirani was writing the film, Sanjay was toying with the idea of playing Sunil Dutt because as a father, he was the one person who had closely seen the ups and downs in his life. Sanjay was extremely close to his dad, and he thought he could emulate him better than any other actor. But he dropped the idea, even before letting his buddy Raju know what he had on his mind, and allowed him to choose an actor who’d be perfect to play the late actor.” \nThere are reports that the film might see a December 2017 release and might clash with Salman Khan’s Tiger Zinda Hai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:34:37.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
