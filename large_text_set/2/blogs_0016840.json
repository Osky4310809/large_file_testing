I have spent the night in hospital,” said the unnamed photographer, Fox News reported .\nThe neighborhood in question is heavily populated by Muslims, most of them immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East.\nThe neighborhood, Rinkeby, had also been the scene of riots in 2010 and 2013.\nAt a rally in Florida on Saturday , Trump lamented violence and unrest in Europe caused by an influx of Muslim immigrants.\n“You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” he said in a remark widely mocked in Sweden and by his domestic foes.\nThe president later said he was referring to a report on Fox News he saw Friday claiming that crime and violence had spiked in the Nordic country — a claim denied by the Swedish police.\n“It’s very judgmental,” said Nicklas Lund, a spokesman for the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, which researches the country’s crime data, according to ABC News .\nSweden has 15 suburbs with high crime rates, Lund said, and Rinkeby is one of those suburbs.\nThe council said the number of reported crimes in those 15 areas decreased in 2015 — to 19,092 from 19,576 in 2014.\nIn 2012 the number of reported crimes in the suburbs was over 20,200.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:59:28.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
