Years of suffering. A feeling there’s no hope for the future. Trading your best player in a bad deal and being told later that your team had a better offer and passed. Sacramento Kings fans have experienced it all, and now their subreddit has broken in honor of the team’s failures.\nOn Monday night, the members of r/kings decided enough was enough, and instead of talking about the team they would become a subreddit for The Lion King. Game threads are now devoted to rewatching the movie and the team roster on the page has been completely overhauled.\nA few die-hard fans clearly suffering from Stockholm Syndrome continue to try and talk about basketball, but at this point it’s all being drowned out with Lion King discussion. Sometimes it can get pretty dark.\nYou can only push fans so far before they snap, and Kings fans reached their breaking point before the Boogie trade. This just pushed them over the edge. Now we wait to see if other subreddits follow suit, because the Browns are PRIME to become a Clifford the Big Red Dog subreddit.\n( h/t @KennyDucey )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:26:29.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
