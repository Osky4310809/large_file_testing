Usually Republicans are supposed to be a bit aggressive and offensive while enforcing their policies but Trump seems to be more aggressive than many of his predecessors.\nWriting just after Trump’s oath-ceremony, journalist Mehdi Hasan aptly summed up in his article Donald Trump ushers in a new era of kakistocracy: government by the worst people, published in the New Statesman, “There is no historical analogy for President Trump. He combines in a single person some of the worst qualities of some of the worst US presidents: the Donald makes Nixon look honest, Clinton look chaste, Bush look smart.”\nJust a few days after coming to power, Trump barred visas for 90 days to migrants or visitors from seven Islamic countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Now the situation calls to go deeper with understanding on the crises all these Muslim dominated countries are going through — for being exploited by the design of mischievous US policies and of its allies in Europe and Arab world.\nThe story goes this way:\nIran\nA Muslim dominated country, with near about 90% people from Shia sect. In 1979, an Islamic Revolution under Shia religious cleric Ayatollah Khomeini forced Iran’s monarch and one of the best allies of US in the Persian Gulf region, Raza Shah Pahlavi go into exile. Under Khomeini, the Islamic Iran started defying US on each and every front — and the regime was equally defiant for the other pole of the bipolar world, the USSR. With the backing of both the powers and their friendly states in the West Asian region, Iraq’s authoritarian ruler Saddam Hussain attacked Iran and engaged it into an 8-year-long war which devastated both the countries, killed eventually more than a million people.\nIn between, Saddam used chemical weapons against Iranians and Iraq’s own Shia as well as Kurds. Staying indifferent with such mass-scale murders, the US remained not only indifferent but rather in 1983, Donald Rumsfeld himself visited Iraq and stayed at Saddam Hussain’s palace in Baghdad to assure the American support to his bloody plot against Iran. On the other side, the US put Iran under continuous sanctions for 36 years just because the country had been defying the unjustified Western hegemony.\nIraq\nA country, under the dictatorship of Saddam Hussain, was used by the US to counter the Ayatollah Khomeini led revolution, but when Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1992 — it became a pariah state, sanctions were imposed on it for killing thousands. And in 2004, the US attacked Iraq, Saddam ran away from his palace, was caught in a rat hole — and from there he was picked before being hanged a few weeks later. Since then, the country has been in the grip of turmoil — and and elusive. Since last three years after the emergence of the so called Islamic State, there has been a massive rise in suicide bombings and car bombings. With the battle to take over country’s second city Mosul back from the clutches of the so called Islamic State entering the final stage, till now near about a million people have been killed in the country since the US invasion to topple Saddam.\nLibya\nUnder the pretext of bringing democracy, the US along with its NATO allies attacked Libya. The armed insurgents there, mainly terrorists, made the dictator Muamar Gadafi to run away and from Libyan capital and ultimately lynched him at a street on October 20, 2011. Since then, a ‘permanent government’ has been missing in Libya, as different warring factions control different regions. It must not be forgotten that the best quality of aviation fuel comes from Libya and at the time of NATO attack on the country, the aviation industry across the world was going through an unimaginable crisis.\nSomalia and Sudan\nThe US hypocrisy vis-a-vis the African nations is there to see for all. They have sucked the African land out of its minerals and people out of their blood by making them fight and get killed; no one in this part of the world gets to know how and when they are killed. Sadly, the world outside cares little about them too.\nSyria\nUnder the pretext of regime change, the Western countries led by US along with their client states like Saudi Arabia and Turkey forced Syria deep down to a bloody civil war which is still going on and no one knows when it is going to end. Thousands have been killed and more than a million displaced. They tried to enforce a regime change on the most peaceful and open country in West Asia without offering any alternative. For them the alternative was either the so called Syrian rebels, gang of terrorists or the Islamic State which holds the state of Raqqa. Now they themselves seem to be clueless how to get out of this bloody mess which they created probably to safeguard Israel and Saudi Arabia from Shia Iran. Even if the hostilities are completely seized, Syria will not be able to witness peace in the foreseeable future, the scars left by 6 year long civil war will never be healed. There are many parties to the Syrian conflict, each one playing their own part but at the end its the Syrian people who suffer the most.\nYemen\nArab world’s poorest country being bombed since last 2 years by Saudi Arabia, Arab world’s richest country with the help of the US only. No one cares even a bit about what has happened in Yemen, a bombed out nation where a large chunk of population is dying out of hunger and malnutrition, all because of Obama and his ‘peace-loving’ policies of running with the hares and hunting with the hounds.\nIt should also not be missed that not a single out of 9/11 hijackers came from the countries bearing the brunt of Trump’s travel ban. The attackers belonged to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Lebanon and none of these countries have figured the American list of the nations to go under the hammer of the “racist” travel ban.\nIn a nutshell, Obama ravaged Syria and Yemen while Trump will take his ‘democracy enforcing’ legacy forward in an uglier way. Like Obama and all other US presidents, he too can never show the guts to take Saudi Arabia and Israel, two of America’s closest surrogate states — the reason behind most of the problems in the Muslim world, head on. And that’s where the problem lies. We must not see any difference between an Obama or a Trump. In the US politics, all are equal when it comes to hypocrisy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T14:27:04.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
