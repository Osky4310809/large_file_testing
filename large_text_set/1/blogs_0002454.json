Richard and Mildred Loving helped to change that. After the Virginia couple—made up of a white man and a black woman—were arrested for marrying across the color line, they took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court determined on June 12, 1967, that preventing a couple from marrying on the basis of race marked a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. From then on, nationwide bans on interracial marriage were overturned. Today, Loving Day is celebrated annually on June 12 to recognize the fight Richard and Mildred Loving waged against racial injustice. Want to know more about Loving Day? Get the facts with this profile of the celebration’s history. How Loving Day Began \nInterracial marriage may currently be thriving in the U.S., but much of the public doesn’t know whom to credit for its legalization. Among the uninformed was Ken Tanabe, a mixed-race graphic designer who happened across information about the struggles of Richard and Mildred Loving during a Google search on an entirely different topic. Tanabe was not only surprised to learn about the fight to have interracial marriage legalized but also that his peers were unfamiliar with the Loving case, which he made the subject of his graduate thesis at Parsons the New School for Design in New York. He then set out to inform as much of the public as possible about the landmark Loving v. Virginia case by launching the Loving Day celebration. \nIn June 2004, the Loving Day website made its debut. In the years following, Loving Day has not only garnered international press but also been celebrated around the world. Those who cannot find celebrations in their area are encouraged to start their own. The flagship Loving Day celebration takes place in New York City. Today, Loving Day is the largest multiracial celebration in the country, Time magazine reported . The Mission of Loving Day \nThe purpose of Loving Day celebrations isn’t simply to honor Richard and Mildred Loving but also to counteract the racial injustice that exists today and to provide an opportunity for the multicultural community to join together. Moreover, Loving Day aims to foster multicultural awareness and to inform the public about interracial relationships. To celebrate Loving Day, one needn’t be part of an interracial couple, have biracial heritage or belong to any particular racial group. All people are welcome to participate. According to the Loving Day website: \n“Like the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Loving Day provides an annual opportunity for people to learn history's lessons while envisioning ways to improve the future. However, Loving Day is not limited to a single annual event. It's also an educational campaign that you can be a part of every day…We believe that education is a necessary part of promoting tolerance, awareness, and understanding.” Loving v. Virginia \nThere would be no Loving Day if Richard and Mildred Loving hadn’t stood up for their rights. Their journey began even before they wed in 1958. Because their home state of Virginia forbade interracial marriage, the Lovings had to flee to Washington, D.C., to tie the knot. There was just one problem: Virginia not only barred mixed marriages but those who married interracially elsewhere from reentering the state. Given this, police arrested the Lovings after they settled down as a married couple in Virginia. Although a judge found them guilty of breaking the law, he agreed to spare them a yearlong stint in jail if they left the state for 25 years. He defended the interracial ban by remarking, \"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, Malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\" \nLiving in Washington was no cakewalk for the Lovings. They faced housing discrimination and harassment due to their interracial union. Plus, they missed the family and friends they’d left behind in Virginia dearly. After five years, the couple found their situation unbearable, and Mildred Loving wrote to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for help. Kennedy’s office informed the American Civil Liberties Union about the Lovings’ plight. From there, the ACLU found two attorneys willing to help the Lovings plead their case free of charge. \nAfter a nine year legal battle, the Loving case reached the Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld the couple’s right to marry. The ruling struck down a 305-year-old Virginia ban on interracial marriage and prohibited the 15 other states with anti-miscegenation laws from enforcing them. Throughout American history, a total of 42 states banned interracial marriage between whites and blacks and other minority groups at different points. Of the decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren remarked, \"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides within the individual and cannot be infringed on by the State.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T06:01:03.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
