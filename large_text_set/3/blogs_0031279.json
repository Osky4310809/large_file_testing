In case you forgot, he sent a photo of his crotch while his toddler son was lying right next to him. \nAccording to recent reports, the political staffer wants to give her marriage another try.\nRelated: It's Not Just Anthony Weiner Sending D*ck Pics \nAn insider says: \n\"Huma has been working hard on her relationship with Anthony… He has been spending 80 to 90 percent of his time at the [Irving Place apartment] they share… If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother's apartment in Brooklyn.\" \nApparently, their families don't want the couple to throw in the towel either.\n\"Both [his and her] families are hoping they will reconcile.\" \nIn fact, a different source says the power twosome never really broke up; it was all a PR stunt for Miz Clinton's now-defunct campaign. The split was:\n\"more for optics for the campaign and [under] pressure from Hillary's camp.\" \nEven though Weiner has sent explicit photos to countless woman, Miz Abedin takes comfort in the fact that he's never had a physical affair.\n\"A lot of [their] friends believe this is an illness, that he is sick… Huma takes it into consideration that there's been no affair, or physical contact that anybody is aware of. He never met [the women].\" \nThese two can't quit each other! \n[ Image via WENN . ] \nTags: anthony weiner , hillary clinton , huma abedin , love line , politik", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:51:19.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
