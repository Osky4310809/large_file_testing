We just got the best news ever. Two of the most hilarious women in the world are teaming up for a spy movie. Yep! Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis are going to star together in a comedy action film . Praise the movie gods.\nSony Last year, Kate and Mila both shined — in Ghostbusters and Bad Moms, respectively — so it’s exciting to see them exhibiting their comedy chops in another film, especially since they’ll be together! According to Variety , the film will be called The Spy Who Dumped Me , an obvious play off the Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me spy-comedy film, which itself was a play off of the James Bond movie, The Spy Who Loved Me .\nDan MacMedan / Contributor / Getty Images, Gary Gershoff / Contributor / Getty Images So what’s the premise of what’s sure to be our new favorite film? According to Deadline Hollywood , The Spy Who Dumped Me will be about:\n“Best friends who unwittingly become entangled in an international conspiracy when one of the women discovers the boyfriend who dumped her was actually a spy.” Secret spy business and revenge on an ex? Could this BE a more perfect formula for these two?! After all, Kate could surely use her action experience from fighting all of those ghosts, and Mila was a pretty epic stunt driver in Bad Moms .\nSTX Entertainment So could we see a car chase in the new film? We’ll have to wait a while to find out. The film will likely shoot this summer when the two in-demand stars both have a break in their schedules. In the meantime, you can catch Kate McKinnon on Saturday Night Live and Mila Kunis in Bad Moms Christmas this December.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:27:37.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
