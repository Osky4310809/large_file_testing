And we guess that makes sense seeing as ketchup is one of the top favorite condiments ( beat out this past year only by Sriracha ). \nAfter uncovering the best way to get ketchup out of the bottle , we didn’t think there were many more condiment discoveries to be had. But it turns out there was at least one left: Twitter just discovered that people seriously disagree about where to store their condiments. \nIt’s fridge vs. pantry for ketchup storage . A photo posted by Heinz Ketchup (@heinzketchup_us) on Feb 7, 2016 at 3:50pm PST \nAnd people are getting fired up. It all started back in January with this tweet. \nwhere does ketchup belong\n— vic (@vicidc_) January 24, 2017 Fridge won by a long-shot, but don’t think that means pantry-supporters don’t have equally strong opinions. \nKetchup doesn't go in the fridge.\nKetchup doesn't go in the fridge.\nKetchup doesn't go in the fridge.\nKetchup doesn't go in the fridge.\n— Doug Gimmedome (@jabbjones) January 25, 2017 One observant Twitter user had an important insight to share. \n@vicidc_ pic.twitter.com/OQZkPrGCt5 \n— Brifi (@BrianForschler1) January 25, 2017 But that didn’t change anyone’s mind once it had already been made up. \n@BrianForschler1 @vicidc_ \"for best results\" my ass it tastes the same \n— VK (@VKwutsgood) January 25, 2017 Quickly, things devolved into chaos with Twitter users coming at each other and getting into fights. \n@leos_haus @vicidc_ \nYou use the ketchup instantly after opening a packet. Bottles that have been opened need to be stores in the fridge\n— GalaxyMonstero Ⓜ️ (@GalaxyMonstero) February 5, 2017 @leos_haus @vicidc_ \nThey dont need to be, but stores recommend it because bacteria starts to grow after being opened when in pantry.\n— GalaxyMonstero Ⓜ️ (@GalaxyMonstero) February 5, 2017 It even drove families apart. \nAsked Dad whether he keeps his Ketchup in the fridge or the cupboard and this is his response... pic.twitter.com/LJJmJlL71F \n— amy (@amyheppolette) February 2, 2017 Lines were drawn in the sand, and people took their sides. \nI could never be with someone that keeps their ketchup in the cupboard not the fridge.\n— bee (@pinealpples) February 2, 2017 ppl who put their ketchup in the fridge - dont trust em xx\n— rosie (@KIRKPATRlCK) February 1, 2017 If you keep ketchup in the pantry you're an animal and there's no room for you in civilized society\n— luke (@lukelton) February 2, 2017 That’s when the professionals got dragged into the fray. \nThe football professionals, that is.
