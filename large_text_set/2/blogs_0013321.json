Chicharito did not miss the chance. — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 17, 2017 \nIt was also a near miss with history for the striker as he scored the 50,001st goal in Bundesliga history. Karim Bellarabi netted the milestone 50,000th in the 23rd minute to open the scoring for Leverkusen. \nChicharito’s hot streak continued in the second half, as he picked up the brace in the 65th minute to put his side up 3-1 in the contest after Augsburg had pulled one back. Leverkusen moved into eighth place in the league with the win, for the time being, with Freiburg to play this weekend. \nThe striker, who had 17 league goals last season, is now up to nine on the Bundesliga campaign and 11 overall.
