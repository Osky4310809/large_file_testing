She's tough, she bounces.\" \nThere was no sign of their little nearly-three-year-old daughter Mia, who was presumably being cared for by a nanny. The pair laughed and smiled as they greeted guests and friends (Photo: Splash News) Zara laughs as she chats with Australian entrepreneur Gerry Harvey (Photo: Splash News) \nSpeaking ahead of the event, the royal's spokesperson told media that Olympic silver medallist Zara was \"keen and ready to play\" a game of polo. \nIt comes just two weeks after the couple released the news of the loss of their second child. \nIn a statement on Christmas Eve, their rep said: \"Very sadly, Zara and Mike Tindall have lost their baby.
