According to my very rough calculations, this would correspond to a BAC in the range of 0.12â€“0.14 for a 73kg human. The paper concludes \n...modest alcohol consumption inhibits aspects of creativity based mainly on the secondary process (preparation, certain parts of illumination, and verification), and disinhibits those based mainly on the primary process (incubation, certain parts of illumination, and restitution). \nIn other words, moderate alcohol consumption does improve certain types of creative thinking, while inhibiting other types of creative thinking. Since the skills required for computer programming are solely cognitive in nature (discounting the motor skills required to type, of course), and given that creativity is a large part of computer programming, it is at least plausible that one might gain some amount of improvement from alcohol consumption. \nThere have also been studies on the relationship between alcohol consumption and creative output . That study examined 34 well known, heavy drinking, 20 th century writers, artists, and composers/performers. It concludes: \nAnalysis of this information yielded a number of interesting findings. Alcohol use proved detrimental to productivity in over 75% of the sample, especially in the latter phases of their drinking careers. However, it appeared to provide direct benefit for about 9% of the sample, indirect benefit for 50% and no appreciable effect for 40% at different times in their lives. Creative activity, conversely, can also affect drinking behavior, leading, for instance, to increased alcohol consumption in over 30% of the sample. Because of the complexities of this relationship, no simplistic conclusions are possible. \nSo for a small portion of people there was a notable increase in creative output as a result of alcohol intake. It does appear that the study did not control for the quantity of alcohol intake, though, so this may not be directly applicable to the Ballmer Peak. \nThe best study I was able to find on the subject was by Lapp, Collins, and Izzo . They gave subjects vodka tonics of varying strengths (by varying the ratio of tonic to vodka), some of which did not even contain any alcohol. The subjects believed that they were drinking a standard-strength vodka tonic. The subjects then were asked to perform a number of cognitively and creatively challenging tasks. Here is what they conclude: \nThe present results support the idea that creative people probably gain inspriation from consuming alcohol ..., but show that this effect may be due to the expected rather than the pharmacological effects of the drug. ... A convergence of evidence supported the idea that creativity is enhanced (at least in some aspects) by the expected effects of alcohol. \nIn other words, alcohol can improve certain aspects of one's cognitive ability, but this effect is not likely due to any pharmacological process ( i.e. , it is often sufficient to merely believe that one is drinking alcohol in order to achieve the same benefit). \nAnd remember: The Ballmer Peak, as it is currently understood, is but a two dimensional projection of what in reality is a higher dimensional space, vi&. , \n;-)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:54:49.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
