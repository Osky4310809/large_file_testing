Of Trump, Farage added, “He is a larger than life personality. When he was given the rule book for how you run for president, he tore it up.” \nIn his role, the network says Farage will contribute to daytime and primetime programming on both Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network. \n[ image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
