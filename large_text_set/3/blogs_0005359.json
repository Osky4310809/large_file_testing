She said he shot himself as she called 911.\nShe showed paramedics the cellphone photo she took of his body, claiming she sent it to a friend because she didn’t know what to do. The friend told her to call authorities. Police say there was no gun in Dennis Drum’s hand in that photo and it was taken 11 minutes before the 911 call was made.\nTeresa Drum was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide and was being held without bail at the Allegheny County Jail. No attorney information was listed in online court documents.\nDuring police questioning later, she told officers she drank seven beers and her husband was insulting her and cursing her cooking. She said they wound up in the bedroom, where her husband pulled the gun from a holster and she put her finger on the trigger and it went off, court documents said.\nShe told police she took a shower “to rinse off” and then put her bloody clothes in a laundry basket before calling police, according to the documents.\nThe couple’s two children were in the house at the time but were unhurt, said Frazer police Chief Terry Kuhns. He wouldn’t give their ages, but said they are now with family members.\nDrum faces a preliminary hearing March 8.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T17:52:13.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
