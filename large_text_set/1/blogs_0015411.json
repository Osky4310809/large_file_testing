Eduardo Año said yesterday. \nAño said President Duterte was only emphasizing the need to “neutralize terrorist groups once and for all” when he directed the military to bomb the bandits even though their captives could be harmed. \nAño said the military has tactics and techniques to ensure the safety of hostages while running after armed groups. \n“We are trained for that. We always make sure we apply the right force and approach to ensure the hostages are safe. Our first objective is to rescue the hostages,” Año told reporters at Fort Bonifacio on Monday night. \n“Because of new technology, you can target one side of a building without harming the hostages,” he added. \nIn a speech before businessmen on Saturday, Duterte ordered security forces to bomb bandits who are trying to escape with their hostages to finally end the problem of kidnappings.   \nMeanwhile, Año ordered Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) chief Maj. Gen. Carlito Galvez to crush the Abu Sayyaf in six months. \nGalvez took over the post from Lt. Gen. Mayoralgo de la Cruz, who was named inspector general of the AFP, yesterday. \nAño expressed optimism that Galvez could do the job even as he gave assurance that the AFP would support Westmincom in accomplishing its mission. \n“Westmincom is our priority. All our resources, best soldiers will be deployed here,” Año said during the turnover ceremony at Camp Navarro in Zamboanga City. \nMeanwhile, the President posthumously promoted Capt. Clinton Capio who was slain during an encounter with Abu Sayyaf bandits in Basilan last week. \nDuterte signed the recommendation for Capio’s promotion when he visited the Army officer’s wake at Fort Bonifacio on Monday night. \nThe President also assured Capio’s wife May Shiel on the prompt release of the benefits for her husband. \nAño said Capio’s family would receive P2 million aside from a monthly pension. \nCapio’s daughter will be granted a scholarship while his widow will be given a job, Año added. – With Roel Pareño  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T11:39:22.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
