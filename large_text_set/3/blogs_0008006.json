That includes anything from on-campus football facilities to the social media department for teams. The latter is being capitalized on quite successfully by Clemson, which is fresh off of its national title victory over Alabama in January.\nThe Tigers are now taking cues from the rapper Future, who in his newly released album, Future , seems to give Clemson a shout-out in his song “Good Dope.” The lyric, which reads “South Carolina boys, we good in Tampa,” is now being used to market the Tigers’ 35-31 win over Alabama in Tampa. It’s being sent out to recruits, too.\nThis is pretty nice pic.twitter.com/pq1pKGM3qz\n— Gunner Britton5️⃣3️⃣ (@GunnerB53) March 10, 2017 'Preciate the love, @1future #NationalChampions #Clemson #ALLIN pic.twitter.com/9unCSb9846\n— Clemson Football (@ClemsonFB) March 1, 2017 Not to stand on a soapbox here or anything, but this is stuff that few other programs are doing. Sure, the Tigers benefited from having Future mention them in his song, but they took that and then ran with it. This, along with new features like the program’s brand new football facility that houses a slide in the middle of it , is setting Clemson apart. The Tigers are making their own unique brand, and it’s clearly setting them apart.\nGood looks, Clemson.
