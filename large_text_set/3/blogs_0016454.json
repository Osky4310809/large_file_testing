It’s not always physical. When it’s verbal should that also be legal?\nROBERTS: Well we know when someone… is a wolf-whistle harassment? It depends upon the person. Some girls think that that is wonderful, they, you know, they smile. Others are offended. So, wolf-whistle in one court are we going to outlaw it, and another court we’re going to say it’s fine, a compliment?\nKARVELAS: So in that sense you think sexual harassment laws go too far as well?\nROBERTS: When it comes to verbal, as I said before, yeah.\nKARVELAS: You do?\nROBERTS: Yes.\nKARVELAS: So do you believe in law reform around sexual harassment laws?\nROBERTS: I haven’t seen the sexual harassment laws so I’d need to read them first.\n\nResponding to the claim some “girls” like wolf whistling, Labor’s Linda Burney had a three word response.
