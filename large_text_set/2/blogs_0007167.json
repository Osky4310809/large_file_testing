David Ramsey, the only other person besides Stephen Amell to have been a series regular on Arrow ever since the pilot, thinks he knows. \nIt came up when, during an interview earlier today, we asked Ramsey about the possibility of seeing more of Audrey Marie Anderson, who plays his onscreen wife, Lyla Michaels. \n\"That's a dynamic that really has a story arc waiting for it,\" Ramsey said. \"She's the leader of ARGUS, he's the leader of Team Arrow when Oliver's out -- and they have two different philosphies altogehter....What do you talk about at dinneritme with that?...They're bringing that back, and it's a big, long season, so we'll see how it plays out.\" \nThen he added, \"Audrey's working on Training Day right now, so getting her is part of the issue. But I like seeing them together, I like the dynamic. I like that she's a badass, that she's capable in the field, that she's smart, that she has a child. The couple has evolved. They're Felicity and Oliver in five years.\" \nWhat's funny, of course, is that right now, Diggle and Michaels are married with a child -- but five years ago? No such thing. They were divorced and not communicating, until Michaels returned to Starling City (it's Star now, but since for the second time in this article we're talking about the past, we're going to leave it) and rekindled her relationship with her ex over a little ARGUS business. \nWhile Oliver and Feliity never tied the knot (that header graphic notwithstanding), they're...ahead of the curve? Behind it? Ah, who knows. In any case, the man who plays Diggle seems to think Olicity is endgame. It's not the first time he's said it, but we're still fans of how elegantly he said it.
