The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that it is true. \nMike Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, has told the Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional officials investigating the Trump campaign’s potential ties to Russia that he is willing to be interviewed in exchange for a grant of immunity from prosecution, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. \nFlynn resigned his post after telling Vice President Mike Pence that he had not spoken to Russian officials before the election about the sanctions the U.S. had imposed on Russia. Later, when a leak revealed he had spoken with a Russian ambassador , Flynn apologized for misleading Pence, and he resigned very soon after from the administration. \nDemocrats and Trump opponents have been haranguing the administration over accusations that he or his allies were colluding with Russian officials in the election to secure the presidency for the real estate mogul. Trump has vehemently denied the accusations, but Flynn offering his testimony will certainly fuel speculation that there’s fire where there’s been so much smoke. \nFlynn supporters say that he was unfairly targeted by the “deep state” – a secretive group in the bureaucracy of the government orchestrating leaks to damage Trump and his presidency. Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer described their actions as the “revenge of the losers.” \nMeanwhile, Trump’s accusations that he was wiretapped by former President Obama has been under a firestorm and intense criticism, even as House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-Ca.) continues insisting that he has secret information that supports the claim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:28:51.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
