MD was a nice format because it was digital and recordable, so it could functionally replace CDs and cassettes in one package. But in the United States, MD never really caught on as a consumer technology. Why not? The answer is complex, and it's hard to pinpoint a single point of failure. \nIn the 45-minute video below , we get a detailed history lesson on MD and its modest success around the world. You get to see how bulky the original players wereâ€”and the fact that early rechargeable batteries could barely play back one MiniDisc , at a time when portable CD players ran for many hours on a few AA batteries. The format was around for several decades though, and matured quickly...but also began facing competition from MP3 players mid-way through its life. \nWhether you remember MiniDisc or not, this is a terrific video essay on recording tech history.
