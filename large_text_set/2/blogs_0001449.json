Or he's just being a dick about it.\nNow, before you go and make a weak \"tiny hands\" comment, let's look at the proof. It has been long documented that Trump is a complete disaster when it comes to shaking hands, and he appears to be getting worse.\nSEE ALSO: Donald Trump holding executive orders is the meme that keeps giving\nTrump's technique for shaking hands, as pointed out in 2012 by NYMag, is what handshake sites call \" the pull in \" or the \" yank and pull .\" Instead of gripping the other person's hand then moving up and down in unison, Trump will pull his subject closer to him. This is possibly to make it appear as if the person he's shaking hands with is reaching out toward him, which many consider to be a power play.\nOn Tuesday, Trump made a big to-do when he nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. After the announcement, the two shook hands, if you could call it that, and it may be Trump's grossest display of a pull-in yet.\nTrump pulls Gorsuch's hand not once, not twice, but three times during their shake, which also includes a strange hug hand/slap. The third pull is done with such force that Gorsuch is even forced to adjust his footing.\nNow, Trump himself has described shaking hands as \" barbaric ,\" but the only thing barbaric here is his technique.\nUnfortunately, this isn't the only instance of Trump's awkward shake, and in a world where handshakes can hold a serious cultural significance, Trump can definitely get himself in trouble for shaking the wrong world leader's hand the wrong way.\nEven Vice President Mike Pence has had to endure the Trump shake:\nAnd so has FBI Director James Comey:\nPres.
