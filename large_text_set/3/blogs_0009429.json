Judges \n“The National Judiciary Council should sanction any erring judiciary officer immediately to reinforce Nigerians’ confidence in our judicial system,’’ Nalado said. \nHe expressed IPAC’s satisfaction on ongoing war against corruption and commended various anti-graft agencies for their efforts to rid the nation of corrupt practices. \nHe also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for properly transferring power to the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, to act on his behalf. \nThe action, according to the IPAC chairman, has saved the nation from avoidable constitutional crisis as obtained in the past. “This is democracy in action that should be emulated by all public office holders.’’ \nNalado also commended the recent of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in disciplining its erring staff members who were alleged to be involved in corrupt and electoral malpractices. He said that such discipline would go a long way in sanitising the electoral system of the country. \nHe said that the council was working assiduously with INEC to strengthen the capacity of political parties through voters’ education and sensitisation of the public to improve the country’s electoral system. \nThe IPAC chairman also urged the Constitutional and Electoral Review Committee to work with the National Assembly to ensure effective and prompt amendment of the 2010 Electoral Act before the 2019 general elections. \nHe further called on the National Assembly to expedite action on the 2017 budget consideration to ensure its quick passage. \nNewsmen report that IPAC members prayed for quick recovery of Buhari, his safe return to the country and for the nation.
