The attacker is facing his own murder charge. \nProsecutors say Jones was shooting at rival gang members Saturday, over a beef about drug turf. He hit Takiya instead, while she was sitting in a van with her mom near 65th and King. \nTakiya – one of two girls fatally injured Saturday — died three days later. She is the cousin of community activist Andrew Holmes, who suggests even jail inmates think killing children is beyond the pale. \n“When it’s a child, that hits a nerve,” he tells CBS 2’s Audrina Bigos. \nJones is in protective custody at the Cook County Jail.
