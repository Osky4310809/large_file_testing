Two Of Its Punctured Cars Are Up For Auction March 7, 2017 8:08 PM Two cars that once adorned \"The Spindle\" on are the auction block. (eBay) \n(CBS) — Two cars from Berwyn that had a bit role in Hollywood are on the auction block. \nBut you won’t be able to drive them away, as WBBM’s Bob Roberts explains. \nThey’ve got 26-inch holes in their roofs and floors, but they’re not refugees from “The Flintstones.” The former “Spindle” cars have 26-inch holes in their roofs and floors. (eBay) \nThe Berwyn Arts Council is seeking a buyer on eBa y for the VW Beetle and the BMW that sat atop Berwin’s “Spindle” sculpture. It was well-known locally – or infamous – long before the eight-cars-impaled-by-a-spike sculpture was featured in the hit movie “Wayne’s World” in 1992. \nThe car-kabob remnants are being auctioned off – together, not separately – for a minimum of $5,000. No seats, no engines, and no spindle, although the council can put you in touch with its owner. A 1967 VW Beetle and 1976 BMW are relics from the Berwyn “Spindle” sculpture. (eBay) \nThe deadline is Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T06:07:29.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
