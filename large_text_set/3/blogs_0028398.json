The Uruguay international was the subject of a bid for £40 million and one pound from the Gunners at the time, with a release clause in the player’s contract believed to have been triggered. However, Liverpool dug their heels in, keeping the player for another season before he joined Barcelona. \"It was very close, we had an agreement with the player,\" Wenger told beIN Sports (h/t Mattias Karen of ESPN). The Frenchman continued: \"We had been wrongly advised that he had a clause, you know, with a minimum [price]. But we had an agreement with the player. You can ask him. I'm convinced that he wanted to join us. And then they kept him for one more year, they improved his contract and promised to sell him a year later to a club abroad.\" As we can see here courtesy of BBC’s Neil Henderson, Suarez made his intentions clear to the Guardian ’s Sid Lowe that he wanted out of Anfield: Neil Henderson @hendopolis 8/7/2013, 12:22:38 AM However, Liverpool stood firm, with the club’s owner, John W. Henry, taking to social media after the aforementioned bid to say , \"What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?\" The following season, Suarez went on to have the campaign of his life, inspiring a Liverpool title push with a string of sensational displays. Eventually the team came up just short, with poor results against Chelsea and Crystal Palace opening the door for Manchester City , who went on to finish top. Suarez came close to firing Liverpool to the title.

While he’s a player that’s been involved in controversies—he was serving a 10-game ban for biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic at the time of Arsenal's offer—Suarez has proven himself to be a tremendous footballer. Since leaving Liverpool, he’s continued to improve at Camp Nou, making one of the finest attacks in world football even better. Suarez, alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, has helped fire Barca to two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey crowns and the UEFA Champions League in his debut term. Suarez has enjoyed great success since his move to Barcelona.

Indeed, it’s only this season that the Gunners have had a world-class option in the position, moving Alexis Sanchez in off the flank to lead the line. Even so, the Chilean doesn’t quite measure up to Suarez. The Uruguayan’s ferocity, intelligence and will to win would have potentially given Arsenal the crucial boost they still require in pursuit of the game’s top honours.
