Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nEverton chief executive Robert Elstone admits there are a number of hurdles still to overcome before the club get a long-awaited new home in the city. \nThe Toffees have secured an agreement on a site at Bramley Moore Dock, two miles from Goodison Park on the banks of the River Mersey, from Peel Land and Property. \nHowever, the £300million-plus scheme still needs to get through the planning process and be funded adequately, the burden of which falls solely on the club. \nBut nevertheless it is a significant step towards Everton leaving their home of 125 years at Goodison Park. \n\"Clearly, it is vital we have clarity on cost and we have to recognise that the stadium will be significantly more expensive at Bramley Moore Dock,\" said Elstone. Bramley Moore Dock (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \n\"To get that certainty, and ensure the stadium is affordable, we need to confirm stadium design, capacity and configuration and to do that we need to talk to fans, partners and all stakeholders in the project. \n\"We're keen to stress not only the scale of the work ahead but also the remaining risks and uncertainties.
