Read Full Article \nHe gave two recent examples of Democratic \"ideological zealots\" who are using attacks and smears instead of engaging in honest debate. \nFirst, he said, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) attacked Education Secretary Betsy DeVos during her confirmation hearings, calling her \"embarrassing\" and ripping her for supporting school choice. \nO'Reilly said what's actually embarrassing is that Franken opposed DeVos because he has accepted tens of thousands of dollars from the powerful teachers' unions that DeVos is challenging. \n\"Franken, like many politicians, panders to those who give him money,\" O'Reilly said. \nHe turned his attention to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and her outspoken criticism of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the newly confirmed attorney general. \nO'Reilly explained that Warren wanted to paint Sessions as a racist by reading a letter written by civil rights activist Coretta Scott King on the Senate floor, but she was barred from speaking for the remainder of the debate on Sessions' nomination. \n\"You can decide whether the far left is really looking out for the country by objecting to school choice and trying to smear a man like Sen. Sessions,\" O'Reilly said. \"Talking Points believes that honest debate is necessary, but part of that equation is letting you know what's really going on behind the scenes.\" \nWatch the full Talking Points Memo above, and let us know what you think in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:43:08.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
