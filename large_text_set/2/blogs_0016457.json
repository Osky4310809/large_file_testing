Today in a live streamed event, Mukesh Ambani announced that Jio has crossed the 100 million subscribers milestone in just 170 days. The emerging telecom operator added seven customers every second. \nAmbani claims that India is now the number one country in the world for mobile data usage. Jio users consumed 100 crore GB of data last month, the same as mobile broadband users in the US. Per day, Jio users streamed 5.5 crore hours of video and made 200 crore minutes worth of voice and video calls. \nAs promised earlier, Jio will continue to offer unlimited free local, STD and roaming calls to any network for life. Jio promises to match the best-selling tariff plan of any telecom operator in the country, and offer 20 percent more mobile data to boot. Lastly, Ambani also announced that by the end of 2017, Jio will cover all cities, towns and villages in India, serving to 99 percent of the country’s population.
