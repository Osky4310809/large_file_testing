We have them now, and we’ve had them before, and we’ve even had them come from the intelligentsia at times. Above, Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World ( get free text here ), talks with Mike Wallace in 1958 — smack in the middle of the Cold War — about the major threats to American freedom. Who were the villains? Not elected representatives who passed laws with a majority in Congress. No, it was a different set of characters: overpopulation, bureaucracy, propaganda, drugs, advertising, and, yes, television. Part 1 of the interview appears above, and you can continue with Part 2 , and Part 3 . For more interviews from The Mike Wallace Interview (1957-1960) , please revisit our earlier piece . You’ll find some more thought provoking interviews there (and lots of cigarette peddling). 470", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T14:52:45.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
