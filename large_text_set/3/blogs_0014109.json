By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 15, 2017 2:25 PM Digvijay Singh questioned Vishwajit Rane on what he was doing with Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in the hotel. (ANI) \nA day after Congress MLA Vishwajit Rane blamed his party for not been able to form government in the state even after being a single largest party in the just concluded Assembly polls, senior party leader, while stating that all is well in the party, asked him what he was doing with Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in the hotel. \nYesterday, Vishwajit Rane said that the party may have 17 seats in Goa, but it could not form the government because of the ‘slow decision making process’ within the party. Accepting the party’s flaws he said there were ‘lapses and there was a failure on part of Congress leadership’. There were 40 seats in Goa out of which Congress was able to secure 17 whereas BJP was able to secure only 13. However, it is the Bhartiya Janata Party which has staked claim to form government in Goa after garnering support from ‘other’ parties and Independents. \nThe ‘other’ parties had demanded Manohar Parrikar as Goa’s Chief Minister, a demand to which BJP agreed, and paved way for the party to form government in the state. Congress MLA Vishwajit Rane did not blame anybody in particular, saying he ‘cannot identify individual but there was a failure’, but despite his diplomatic stand, his comments may well have been pointed towards Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi . \nYou may also like to watch this video \nEven though the ship for Congress has more or less sailed, there is still a ray of hope for it as the Supreme Court will hear a petition moved by it challenging Goa Governor Mridula Sinha’s decision to appoint ex defence minister Manohar Parrikar as the CM of Goa. The ceremony is supposed to take place in Panaji today at 5 PM after the quick and dramatic turn of events where Parrikar resigned from the prestigious post of Defence Minister to take up Goa chiefministership. The petition was filed on Monday by CLP leader Chandrakant Kavlekar who has asked for a stay on Parrikar’s swearing-in.
