It's not 100 percent clear what happens [if we play him]. \n\"You have to decide about risk. Because we play Plymouth, maybe not the highest intensity game for a centre-half, it would make sense [to play him]. Now he is ready to play for us, that makes it difficult.\" \nMeanwhile, the Cameroon Football Federation (FECAFOOT) said it did not wish \"to comment on decision derived from the laws of the game.\" \nIt added: \"The decision by Liverpool FC is neither in favour of FECAFOOT nor in disfavour of the player, rather in favour of the law.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
