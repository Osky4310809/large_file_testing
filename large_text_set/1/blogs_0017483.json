In Leverkusen, he is in the best position at the moment.\" \nCity's only January signing so far is Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus, whose arrival this month from Palmeiras had been prepared in advance by the club. \nGoal understands Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain are exploring the possibility of making further additions but the club's official line has been that more business is unlikely. \nIf that is the case, City will almost certainly look to bolster their squad in the summer, with a number of key players now over 30 years of age.
