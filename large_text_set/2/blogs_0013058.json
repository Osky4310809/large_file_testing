Then Drake was named the world’s best-selling artist of 2016. Then he was accused of making an Islamophobic statement toward a fan (a charge he called “made up” and against which he ably defended himself ). It’s been a flurry of news, and it has shown no signs of slowing down. \nOn early Saturday morning, Drake and his crew were caught in traffic near the Mancunian Way bridge — a delay caused by a man who seemingly was about to jump off it. Acting as good Samaritan, Drizzy offered to speak with the man. \nAccording to the Manchester Evening News , one of Drake’s boys approached the cops with the suggestion, but they politely decided against the move. \n“He offered for Drake to speak to the male on the bridge, if that would help. The offer was declined with thanks,” an officer explained. \nIn the end, the man got down from the bridge without Drake’s help and was brought to hospital for evaluation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:17:24.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
