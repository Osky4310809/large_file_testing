However, Norway seems to be weaning itself off of whale meat at long last. Most people in Norway see whaling as an antiquated industry and have no desire to eat whale meat. Even Truls Soløy, the head of the Norwegian Whalers Association, admits “people in Norway do not eat whale… there are too few players on the buying side.” Despite this fact, the Norwegian government has slotted 999 minke whales for slaughter in 2017, this is an increase of 116 whales from the previous years year’s quota. \nThat being said, in the recent years, whalers have consistently killed fewer whales than the quota allows for, in 2016, 590 whales were killed when there were allowances for 880 deaths. But if quotas are consistently going unfilled, and there is a massive slump in the demand, why is the Norweigan government getting behind the whaling industry? \nWhaling was big business in Norway before it was outlawed in 1986 by the International Cort of Justice and when the nation announced that they would reopen their waters for whalers in 1993, using a loop-hole they sighted as an “objection,” they hoped to revitalize the once booming industry. However, global appetites had changed. Due to the \nDue to the widespread public outcry against the cruel industry, the demand for whale meat within Norway has plummeted though they have tried exporting whale meat to Japan, demand for the product is tanking there as well. The Norwegian government subsidies about 50 percent of the cost of whale meat stating that the culling of whales helps to preserve the fish populations in the region – this claim is dubious at best. \nOn top of that, most whale meat is highly contaminated. In 2015, Japan dumped a large shipment of whale meat from Norway because at least three toxic pesticides were found trapped in the whale blubber. Because its growing reputation as a tainted meat, the whaling industry has started to sell it as an ingredient for pet food but they have not been met with much success . \nSo how do we end the pointless slaughter of minke whales in Norway? First, share this article and help get the word out about the meritless nature of whaling industry. You can also contact the Norwegian embassy in your country or write to the Norwegian Prime Minister and let them know how upsetting and senseless their continued support for this barbaric practice is. If we all come together, we can stop whaling in Norway and save these important creatures. Want to read more posts like this?
