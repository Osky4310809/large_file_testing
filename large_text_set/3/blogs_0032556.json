There were so many jokes, and so many Photoshops . \nNow the man who sculpted the busted bust has a message for his many haters. \nSEE ALSO: Attacking a referee's small business on Facebook isn't cool, sports fans \n\"It was impossible to please the Greeks and Trojans. Nor did Jesus please everyone,\" artist Emmanuel Santos told The Guardian . \"What matters is the impact that this work generated. There is always the possibility of making a difference. I was prepared for all this.\"\nStraight-up Jesus. Yep — he went there. \nThe bust was unveiled Wednesday at an airport bearing Ronaldo's name in the Madeira Islands, the Portuguese archipelago where he grew up. \nSantos said he drew inspiration from (where else?) the internet.\n\nBust Ronaldo, left, and actual Ronaldo.\nImage: AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\"I used some photos of Cristiano Ronaldo that I found on the internet, nothing specific,\" he told The Guardian . \"I put the photos next to me and started working on the bust.\"\nBut for everyone roasting his piece of art online, Santos says Ronaldo signed off on the bust after asking that the sculptor smooth out some wrinkles. \n\nActual Ronaldo.\nImage: PETINGA/EPA/REX/Shutterstock\n\"He said it made him look older and asked for it to be thinned out a bit to make it smoother and more jovial,\" Santos told The Guardian . \"But they gave it the go-ahead; they liked what they saw.”\nComparing oneself to Jesus might seem a little much. But then again, it's probably a bummer to see a piece of art you earnestly labored over get figuratively shat on across the internet by Millennials thirsty for a few likes and retweets. \nWATCH: Samsung has unveiled the new Galaxy S8, and it's beautiful", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T00:18:32.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
