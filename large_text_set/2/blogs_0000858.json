Len McCluskey says the fees have only helped bosses (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nTory determination to stick with the Employment Tribunal fees is bad news for working people and bad news for good employers who play by the rules. \nUnison, Unite, the TUC and the Law Society have all condemned the Government’s failure to scrap their fees. \nUnite the Union Leader Len McCluskey is right to say “the government is dealing in alternative facts to claim that both the fall in employment tribunal applications is greater than they anticipated and that people are not losing out”. \nSir Oliver Heald MP, the Tory’s Minister for Courts and Justice, opened up this whitewash of a review by claiming “while it is clear that fees have discouraged people from bringing claims, there is no evidence that they have prevented them from doing so”. \nThe trouble is, he hasn’t bothered to find out from the people who know. \nOnly three judges and five organisations contributed to his review. Justice Secretary Liz Truss slipped out the report at the height of the Brexit debate (Photo: PA) \nLast year, even Parliament’s Justice Committee – which is made up of MPs from different parties – agreed the Conservative Government has got it wrong. \nThey recommended that Employment Tribunal fees should be substantially reduced. \nLabour’s policy is clear: a Labour Government would abolish Employment Tribunal Fees. \nIn the meantime, we’ll be standing shoulder to shoulder with trade unions and working people to demand the Government thinks again, does the right thing and scraps these unfair fees. \nRichard Burgon MP is the Shadow Justice Secretary Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:38:33.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
