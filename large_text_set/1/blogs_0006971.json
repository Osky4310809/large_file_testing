CNN’s report was followed by Buzzfeed’s release of a secret dossier that is reportedly the basis of the two-page synopsis given to Trump during last week’s intelligence briefing. \nSpeaking to the Late Night with Seth Myers host, Conway insisted that Trump had already told her that he was unaware of the additional document. \n“He has said that he is not aware of that,” Conway said. She also pointed out that “nobody has sourced” the report, slamming the report for using “unspoken sources in the story.” \nFurther, she blamed Hillary Clinton, stating that the story indicated groups that wanted her to win “may have been behind the investigations themselves” and that the FBI is trying to confirm it. The incoming presidential counselor added that she was concerned about intelligence officials leaking to the press. \nFollowing the release of the report, Trump tweeted out a response , calling it “fake news” and a “political witch hunt.” \nWatch the clip above, via Late Night with Seth Myers . \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:31:18.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
