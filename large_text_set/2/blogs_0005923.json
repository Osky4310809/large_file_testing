How do you ensure you trust well and are trusted?\nDo you begin by trusting everyone and taking a chance? Or, do you start with distrust, allowing experience and time to cajole you into trusting another? As life takes newer forms with advancing invasive technology, it becomes difficult to answer these questions honestly.\nTo be vulnerable, open and trusting were always attractive qualities that left you open to hurt. Today the stakes are higher and so, fraught with danger.\nAnd yet, trust is the basis of all human dealings. We are so dependent on human interactions that life would be impossible without trust. We trust our loved ones, friends, colleagues, and beyond. What would it be like if you didn’t trust the public transport you boarded, your own driver or your cook? What if the security guard at your gate didn’t have your trust?\nWhat if you didn’t trust the bank where you deposit your money? Or the companies you invest in? Life would get chaotic and impossible, and you would become a paranoid basket case. So a certain amount of trust is inherent in our everyday transactions, and certainly in our closest relationships.\nA lack of trust is responsible for breaking up many relationships. But you cannot demand trust; it needs to be earned over time and with experience. Some of us trust more easily than others. What makes it easier for you to trust someone? I usually trust people who make direct eye contact, are open with their gestures, are respectful and self-confident, those who speak the truth no matter what, people who maintain boundaries and do not ladle on fake compliments.\nIn most of Europe, when you board a tram you are trusted to buy and validate your ticket. Checks are few and far between, but when these do happen, offenders are heavily fined. However what totally inspired me was my first experience of the much-publicized ‘London telephone booth library’, which interestingly I saw in Germany! A booth next to the Bonn skating rink had small shelves full of books. You can pick a book to read, but you have to replace it with another! The system works on trust and nobody monitors it. Yet the racks remain full of books.\nI am soon starting one in office because a gesture like this (apart from inculcating the habit of reading) encourages people to believe in themselves. Trust begets trust. You trust someone and it encourages the person not just to trust you back, but also to live up to your trust!\nHowever it would be foolish to say that all these systems haven’t been built keeping in mind the losses they could incur. The wise amongst us always create strong, well-defined boundaries before investing trust in anyone or anything.\nIt is best to start with an open mind and heart, and believe. Allow your instincts to guide you. Get to know a person while keeping within your defined boundaries. Let your guard down once reasonably sure. Else, step away with a new experience learnt…\nI came across some very meaningful advice, “Measure twice and cut once; that’s what a good carpenter does!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:48:01.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
