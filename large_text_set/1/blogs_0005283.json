Frozen's Anna and Elsa Have a Brother . . . And It's Tarzan January 5, 2017 by Maggie Pehanick 334 Shares \nTwo years ago, the team behind Frozen did an AMA on Reddit , and a comment they made blew the collective minds of Disney fans everywhere. While the theory is old, it has just resurfaced and Twitter is not OK. Basically, the directors casually mentioned that Elsa and Anna's parents did not die on a boat and that their story is much different than what we assume when watching Frozen . Here's the full comment: \nThis is the beginning of 1999's Tarzan , another Disney film which Frozen codirector Chris Buck (the \"Chris\" mentioned above) codirected. If this is true, it would mean that Elsa, Anna, and Tarzan come from the same set of parents. The reason this connection is getting brought up now is because of Buck's interview with MTV News in 2015. When asked about the conspiracy theory, Buck said this: \n\"When you're working on a feature, you have a lot of time to think about stuff because it takes four years to make one. I think Jen [Lee] and I were walking to a meeting, and I just start to tell her the entire story. I said, 'Of course Anna and Elsa's parents didn't die. Yes, there was a shipwreck, but they were at sea a little bit longer than we think they were because the mother was pregnant, and she gave birth on the boat, to a little boy. They get shipwrecked, and somehow they really washed way far away from the Scandinavian waters, and they end up in the jungle. They end up building a tree house and a leopard kills them, so their baby boy is raised by gorillas.' So in my little head, Anna and Elsa's brother is Tarzan â€” but on the other side of that island are surfing penguins, to tie in a non-Disney movie, Surf's Up. That's my fun little world . . . I say, whatever people want to believe, go for it. If you want to tie them all together, then do it. That's the spirit of Disney.\" \nIn case you're wondering, Buck also codirected 2007's Surf's Up . In conclusion, the movies are not officially connected. But in Buck's mind, this little guy is Anna and Elsa's baby brother, and penguins are surfing on the other side of his island!
