(Chris Pizzello / Invision/Associated Press) Nardine Saad ceremony will kick off the 2017 awards season on Sunday night. You have questions, and we have answers. \nWHAT TIME DOES THE SHOW START? AND ON WHAT CHANNEL? \nThe ceremony, taking place at its usual locale, the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, will air live from coast to coast on NBC from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Pacific time. \nWHO IS HOSTING? \n“The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon will be bringing his brand of nice-guy humor to the proceedings, replacing last year’s acerbic four-time host Ricky Gervais. It’ll be the “Saturday Night Live” alum’s first time hosting the boozy affair, but not his debut at the helm of a high-profile ceremony — he hosted the Emmy Awards in 2010, when the show aired on NBC. \n“The Golden Globes are exciting for me to host because I get to wear this tuxedo I’m already practicing wearing every single night and just handing out awards to random people,” Fallon quipped in a TV spot. \nIncidentally, the funnyman has won four Primetime Emmy Awards, but has yet to be nominated for a Golden Globe. \nFull coverage: 2017 Golden Globe Awards » \nWHO ARE THE NOMINEES? \nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. , which began as a handful of L.A.-based overseas journalists in the 1950s but now represents 56 countries, selects the nominees and winners for the ceremony, which awards recipients across movies, television and music. \nIn film, “Hacksaw Ridge,”“Hell or High Water,”“Lion,”“Manchester by the Sea” and “Moonlight” were nominated for best drama picture, and “20th Century Women,”“Deadpool,”“Florence Foster Jenkins,”“La La Land” and “Sing Street” were nominated for musical or comedy picture category. \nIn television, “The Crown,”“Game of Thrones,”“Stranger Things,”“This Is Us” and “Westworld” earned nods in the drama category, while “Atlanta,”“black-ish,”“Mozart in the Jungle,”“Transparent” and “Veep” were selected among the year’s best comedies. “American Crime,”“The Dresser,”“The Night Manager,”“The Night Of” and “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” are up for limited series or TV movie. \nA notable mention goes out to “Florence Foster Jenkins” star Meryl Streep, who is set to attend the show as this year’s recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for \"outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.\" The 67-year-old actress — a three-time Oscar winner — has earned 29 Golden Globe nominations in her 40-plus year career in film and has won eight. \nYou can size up the complete list of nominees here .

In the film acting races, Whipp suspects that “Manchester” star Casey Affleck and “Jackie” star Natalie Portman will win the drama awards. \nSorry, “Deadpool.” The musical “La La Land” is expected to win big across the musical or comedy categories, including best lead actor and actress for its headliners, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. \nIn television drama, Netflix’s Queen Elizabeth series “The Crown” is expected to win best TV drama, coronating its star, Claire Foy, with the best actress title. Meanwhile, “Goliath” lead Billy Bob Thornton looks to be a shoo-in for the best actor win. \nIn TV comedy, move over, “Mr. Robot.” FX’s rookie series “Atlanta” is expected to take the top honor, with its star Donald Glover winning the best actor race. Issa Rae of “Insecure” may follow in the footsteps of best actress predecessors Gina Rodriguez and Rachel Bloom if the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. repeats its tradition of awarding newcomers in television. \nAs for the mini-series and TV movies category, Emmy darling “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\" and \"The Night Manager\" lead the TV nominees with five and four nominations apiece, respectively. \nHere are the story lines to watch out for. \nWHO ARE THE PRESENTERS? \nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. is once again tapping Hollywood’s finest to dole out the awards.
