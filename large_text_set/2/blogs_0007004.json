My friends nodded. ‘That’s normal.’ I appreciated their sympathy but was left none the wiser as to how to deal with the morose sense of loss, the leaden weight in my body, the ordeal of getting to the end of an ordinary day (and night). My pain was tinged with depression. I know too that depression and loss and grief affect millions of us. These emotions are as old as time itself, yet invariably the well-meaning medical world push modern solutions – anti-depressants, counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy. Previously, when faced with difficulties, I’ve given these options a go and eventually rebooted. But last summer was different. Emotionally and physically battered, I was in shock. I needed to reach outside the ordinary. I woke one morning resolute. I had to find a horse. Doc Martin star Martin Clunes – an enthusiastic equestrian – spoke out about the need for every school in the country to have access to a horse in order to combat anxiety and behavioural problems As a child, I grew up in the middle of nowhere – perfect pony land – but was never allowed a horse. I was an outsider looking into an unobtainable world of prim girls with rosettes, paddocks and pony clubs and expensive paraphernalia. And the problem persists. In London, for a princely sum you get to sit on a horse for half an hour and there is little chance of equine bonding while some woman in breeches shrieks commands about posture. I wanted to ride free on a horse. I longed to forget myself on a powerful animal, to feel a healthy dose of fear and place my faith in another being. Middle-aged men can keep their predictable fast cars – I wanted to ride fast on an animal with a mind of its own. Everybody needs to find a safe place, a haven where they don’t have to stand on ceremony, and I found mine at Grange Farm, a trekking centre that has been run by the same delightful, laid-back family for more than 50 years. Based in Chapel-Y-Fin, a tiny hamlet in the Black Mountains where Herefordshire meets Wales, it’s miles off the beaten track, and that’s part of the appeal. There isn’t a man-made jump or sawdust-filled pen in sight, just a herd of handsome horses, their sandy, bay, black and chestnut coats blending into the rusts and browns of the Honddu Valley. The view alone was well worth the journey. Chatting to my co-rider, Rosa, as we tacked up two beautiful Welsh Cob Crosses, I felt instantly better. My horse for the day was Sandstone, who had a blond mane, docile eyes and a freshly clipped coat. This was my second visit since I lost the baby; I’ve learnt to tighten the girth and adjust my stirrups, feel the horse beneath me as we walk, rise with his rhythm when we trot. At this visit we are going to canter. Cue a frisson of excitement: learning something new is too often the exclusive preserve of the very young. Sandstone’s steamy breath mixes with mine as we trot on behind Rosa and her mount, Whitaker. I can feel my heart bump, my hands are tingling, and then we are off together, thumping fast across the hard ground, my every fibre focused on Sandstone, his rhythm, his speed, his direction. It is a blur of sensations. I lose a stirrup, I am clinging on to the horse’s withers but together we’ve cantered up the valley, matching Rosa and Whitaker stride for stride. I’m pumped with adrenaline. Perhaps I even punch the air. Best of all I’m glad to be alive. The combination of speed, fear and natural beauty has wrenched me out of myself. I finally feel a bit better. If it wasn’t for the bacon sandwich I ate back at the Grange, it would even be a great diet. Cantering is cracking exercise. The next day I can feel muscles I never knew existed – and there’s a smile on my face. To find out more about riding in Chapel-Y-Fin, visit grangetrekking.co.uk or call 01873 890 215.
