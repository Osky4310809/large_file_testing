But you know, it's hard to win one of those things ... as you well know .\" \nAnd while it is indeed true that Roenick never did play for a Stanley Cup winner in his 20-year career, it also seems that \"Mad Men\" star Hamm is too polite to have intentionally slipped that in as a dig, right? \nRight?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T10:42:33.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
