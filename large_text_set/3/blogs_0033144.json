More than that, though, the lack of curves may mean Apple’s upcoming flagship iPhone may not be as “edge-to-edge” as previous rumors have suggested (which would line up with an earlier rumor ): \n“While Apple’s new OLED form factor looks similar, current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less “infinity” screen form factor.” \nThe analyst, Rod Hall of JP Morgan, has also said that he expects the entire line of iPhones to see their price expand moving forward, and that the high-end OLED iPhone 8 will indeed start at $1,000 . Hall doesn’t articulate what the new prices will look like, however. He does believe that Apple will stick to 3GB of RAM for the high-end models, though. Like this post?
