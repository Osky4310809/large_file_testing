Maxine Waters Wore A 'James Brown Wig' \nApril Ryan , the Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks , asked Spicer how the White House plans to \"revamp its image\" after two months of divisive policies and persistent reports of Trump's connection to Russia.\nUnfortunately, the word \"Russia\" triggered old Spicey like a Soviet sleeper agent, launching him into full-on defensive jerkwad mode.\nSpicer interrupted Ryan's question to unleash a cued-up tirade, barking: \n\"I've said it from the day that I got here until whatever that there is no connection. You've got Russia. If the President puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that's a Russian connection.\"\nAs Ryan pushed back to finish her question, Spicer became more irritated and defensive, continuing:\n\"At some point, report the facts. The facts are that every single person who has been briefed on this subject has come away with the same conclusion – Republican, Democrat. So I'm sorry that that disgusts you. You're shaking your head.\"\nThe testy exchange continued, with Spicer once again ordering Ryan to \"stop shaking your head again.\"\nPhotos: Sean Held A Press Conference With Food In His Teeth \nWatch the uncomfortable moment (below):\n\nIf you want to know why @AprilDRyan just tweeted \"Lawd!!!!\" — this is why.

The White House press corps vet of 20 years told People :\n\"I dropped my head. I was listening to him and thinking of my follow-up question…The bottom line is this: Sean Spicer is doing his job spinning or presenting the facts for the president. And I'm a reporter. Sometimes we knock heads. But this is not new. This day is new, but this is not new.\"\nRyan even sympathized with the Press Secretary, adding:\n\"I guess it's hard up there for [Spicer]. I'm trying to put myself in his position. I know how I feel. For him, it must be hard to stand up there and be fielding questions that are valid and try to come up with real answers when the answers aren't in your boss's favor.\"\nHowever, we think her Twitter reaction posted after the interaction sums it up best:\nLawd!!!!\n— AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) March 28, 2017 \nWe're right there with you! And so were other Twitics who reacted to the press briefing blunder:\n\"April Ryan\" \"stop shacking your head\". The remnants of \"Jim Crow\" and the audacity of the \"White Male Ego.\" This is down right disgraceful\n— Jamel Dorsett (@Dorsett1) March 28, 2017 \n\nSean Spicer is rude to everyone, but it's difficult to imagine him speaking to a white, male reporter the way he spoke to April Ryan today.\n— Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) March 28, 2017 \n\n\"Stop shaking your head\" - @seanspicer to April Ryan.\nHeadshaking is EXACTLY the expected response to these briefings.\n— jay cowit (@jaycowit) March 28, 2017 \n\nApril Ryan is a hero for simply doing her job under this coup-installed administration with its propaganda psyops & emboldened brown shirts\n— Andrea Chalupa (@AndreaChalupa) March 28, 2017 \n\nSally Yates, April Ryan, and Maxine Waters continue to prove that women are leading us in #TheResistance .
