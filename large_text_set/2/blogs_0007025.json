When she dies, life will turn upside down for Brits, and many others who admire her from across the globe. \nThe impact will be even deeper because 81% of UK residents weren't alive when Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne. \nAccording to the UK Office for National Statistics , only 12 million UK residents were alive when King George was on the throne in 1952. That's only 19% of the UK's population of 65 million. \nSince the most recent UK census data was from 2014, we used age-specific death rates to calculate how many Brits who were over 63 in 2014 would likely still be alive today. \nThis remarkable fact is a testament to Queen Elizabeth's stamina as Britain's longest reigning monarch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:04:59.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
