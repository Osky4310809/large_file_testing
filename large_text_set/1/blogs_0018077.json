Trump, in particular, frequently railed against the TPP on the campaign trail and promised to seek one-on-one agreements with other countries instead.\n“A great thing for the American worker we just did,” he said in the Oval Office as he signed the memorandum.\nTrump announced Sunday that he will be meeting in the coming weeks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to discuss overhauling the North American Free Trade Agreement, a trade deal between the three countries signed by President Clinton.\nTrump began his first weekday in the White House hosting a breakfast meeting with a dozen CEOs, including SpaceX’s Elon Musk and Ford’s Mark Fields to discuss stimulating the nation’s manufacturing sector. Trump invited news cameras to cover his remarks on the subject for more than 10 minutes, as he pledged to support the American industrial base, another central campaign theme.\n“It’s what the people wanted,” Trump said in the Roosevelt Room. “It’s one the reasons I’m sitting here instead of someone else sitting here. I think it’s something I’m good at.”\nTrump reiterated his promise to cut personal and corporate tax rates, “massively,” saying, “We’re trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20 percent.” Trump added that he also intends to cut government regulations. “We think we can cut regulations by 75 percent,” he said. “Maybe more.”\nOn both fronts, Trump was silent on the details, offering little guidance on how he intends to fill the budget shortfall the tax cuts would create or which regulations he intends to cut. On Friday, his chief of staff Reince Priebus ordered an immediate regulatory freeze to allow the new administration to study new orders.\nTrump also warned the CEOs against outsourcing jobs or manufacturing, repeating a campaign pledge that they would be subject to a “border tax.” “If that happens, we are going to be imposing a very major border tax on the products when it comes in.”\nTrump informed the CEOs that he intends to follow up with them frequently.\n“We’ll have these meetings every—whenever you need them,” Trump told the businessmen. Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris told reporters that they had asked to report back to the president within 30 days on their suggestions for stimulating the economy and manufacturing. Fields, from Ford, said Trump’s rhetoric on investment and taxes “encourages all of us as CEOs as we make decisions going forward.”\nOn Monday, Trump also signed a memo instituting a federal hiring freeze—”except for the military,” the president clarified—as well as another reinstating the so-called Mexico City policy, prohibiting non-governmental organizations that receive U.S. funding abroad from performing or promoting abortion services.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T19:20:36.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
