Stelter said if not for journalists \"digging, digging, digging\" into Flynn \"we wouldn't know\" about the circumstance of his relationship with his Russian counterparts prior to the administration taking power in late January. \"These journalists who did not ask about Flynn, they looked bad yesterday afternoon, they look even worse now now that Flynn has resigned,\" Stelter said Tuesday morning on CNN. \"By the way, a big moment for investigative journalism. This has been a story led by The Washington Post , The New York Times , the CNNs of the world. If it weren't for journalists digging, digging, digging into this we wouldn't know about it\" Last night, CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson said the press had \"scored some points\" against the White House with the resignation of Michael Flynn. Stelter on Tuesday's broadcast of CNN's New Day : STELTER: These journalists who did not ask about Flynn, they looked bad yesterday afternoon, they look even worse now now that Flynn has resigned. Let's remember that on Friday afternoon that President Trump was on Air Force One, on the way to Mar-A-Lago. He told reporters, when asked about Flynn, he didn't know what it was about. He had not read the story. Does anyone believe that he had not read that bombshell Washington Post story with nine sources that broke this thing wide open?... This was right in plain sign for a while. And, by the way, a big moment for investigative journalism. This has been a story led by The Washington Post , The New York Times , the CNNs of the world. If it weren't for journalists digging, digging, digging into this we wouldn't know about it. So when you hear about anonymous sources, when you hear about leaks from the White House, or from the government, this is why that is so important for us. President Trump tweeted this morning : \"The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?\" The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? â Donald J.
