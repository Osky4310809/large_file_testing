The Best Anime On Netflix Streaming Our international popular culture is already inundated with Attack on Titan . There’s the manga, of course. Then there’s the anime, which is about to debut its second season , two live-action movies, a live-action TV spinoff, video games, and a high school manga AU. What’s another adaptation?\nAccording to Deadline , Warner Bros. is negotiating to get the feature rights for Attack on Titan , which could pave the way for a live-action, Western film based on the popular manga property.\nIf the rights are secured, the plans will be handed over to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them producer David Heyman.\nFor the uninitiated, Attack on Titan , by Hajime Isayama, is a post-apocalyptic story of a group of humans who live behind walls in fear of titans–giant, humanoid beings that devour humans. The bulk of the story follows a boy named Eren as he comes to learn the secrets of the titans and learns to fight them. That’s the basic premise, anyway. The plot is dense and full of conspiracies, government corruption, deception, friendship, potatoes, and tragedy. It’s also incredibly violent, which you can imagine from the story of giant, misshapen cannibals.\nA film adaptation of Attack on Titan could be welcome just based on the action alone, which involves a lot of kinetic, fast-paced, acrobatic combat. A competent action director can do wonders with the material.\nPlus, it’s an anime adaptation that wouldn’t fall prey to Ghost in the Shell -style whitewashing, since only one of the main characters is supposed to be canonically Japanese.\nThe problem here lies in how Attack on Titan is structured, which utilizes slow narrative pacing to drag itself out and extend its own story. This is common in serialized manga, but it doesn’t translate well to screen. The show didn’t tweak any of this, so whoever would work on the film would need to do some heavy lifting to fit any of the arcs into two hours. Who knows if it could be done at all? The first live-action film in Japan did well, but the second did not.\nEither way, it’s just a deal to secure the rights, which means that a movie could be a few years away. We’ll keep you posted on any updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:39:38.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
