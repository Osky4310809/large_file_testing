Hours before the big event, Tilbury prepped Kidman's alabaster skin with the pro's upcoming launch, the Magical Facial Dry Sheet Mask, which will be the first sheet mask in her skin-care range. \"I never start a Hollywood look without [the Charlotte Tilbury Magical Facial Dry Sheet Mask],\" Tilbury tells Allure . \"It hydrates, decreases wrinkles, and it gives you instantly perfect skin.\" Sign us up! So, how does it work? The makeup artist goes on to explain that unlike traditional sheet masks, her Magical Dry Sheet Mask comes, well, dry (just as its name suggests) and should be applied to dry skin and left to sit for about ten minutes. Once those ten minutes are up, the mask is removed and its residue should be massaged into skin. The result? Brighter, smoother, supermodel-like skin. (And trust us, Tilbury knows supermodel skin when she sees itâ€”her top client is industry vet Kate Moss , after all.) \nA behind-the-scenes shot of Tilbury prepping Kidman before the red carpet.
