I caught up, the ball bounced out of bounds, and the buzzer clanked its heavy clank. Halftime. \nAt the bench, one of the volunteer parent-coaches waved me over. \"You're really running like a girl out there,\" he said, pointing to the court. \nI was 10, only one year into what would later become a longtime affair with basketball and running. I looked at my coach with furrowed brows. \nHe went on to explain what proper form looks like. \"You're losing a lot of energy running like that. Your arms are flying around, but you're not really covering any distance.\" \nI nodded. I wanted to be a good basketball player, and if \"running like a girl\" meant I was wasting energy and would get singled out during halftime, I wanted to fix it. It wasn't until I was 22 and in graduate school completing a thesis on media portrayals of gender in sports that I thought back on that formative moment. I'd spent the 12 years after that basketball game committed to having proper form — shoulders back, elbows at my sides — not because I thought it would make me a better athlete, but because someone had told me it was the right way to move. In that moment, my muscles tensed. I was angry. Proper form was important, but why was it considered a gender issue? \nRealizing this was both embarrassing and humbling, and it also helped shape how I feel about the phrase \"run like a girl.\" Still an athlete, I'm proud to get up in the morning, lace up my adidas UltraBOOST X running shoes , and hit the pavement for a jog. I'm proud to be a runner . And I'm proud to be a girl. \nInterested in learning how other runners felt about this phrase, I tapped POPSUGAR staffers for their thoughts.

She ran competitively for 10 years, earning an All-American title in the 1000m in college. The New York City Marathon? She's done that, too. \nThe first time someone told her that she runs like a girl: \"I was in middle school during the New York State Fitness assessment test where the whole class had to run a mile in order to complete Phys Ed. Everyone was intimidated by the task, and the boys began to shout that I run like a girl. I remember looking at the backs of their heads as they passed me and saying to myself, 'I'll show them how girls run.' As I chased them around the field for the remaining laps I realized that running like a girl meant I could do anything I put my mind to, and for me, that day, it was beating them!\" 2 / 6 3 Aimee Simeon, Editorial What’s Your Reaction?

Women are strong, powerful, dynamic beings, and running like a girl is absolutely beautiful in my mind.\" 3 / 6 4 Kaitlyn Viola, Marketing What’s Your Reaction?
