Cedric Richmond was “despicable,” and called on Richmond to apologize to Conway. \nReferring to a picture of Conway kneeling on a couch in the Oval Office, Richmond said she looked “familiar” with being on her knees, a comment that she described as sexist.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images \n“Despicable,” Chelsea wrote on Twitter . “I hope [Conway] receives the apology she deserves.” She couldn’t help adding in a bit of snark, however, adding that she “certainly never thought I’d write that” but that “I mean every word.” \nRichmond claimed the joke wasn’t meant to have sexual connotations. \n“I notice he did not apologize, he tried to clarify,” Conway previously told The Daily Caller. She also said that the media would have been more outraged “not just if I were a liberal woman, but if I were a pro-abortion one.” \nShe added that she was in that position on the couch because she was taking pictures of President Trump with the presidents of historically black colleges and texting the pictures to the college presidents. \nWATCH: \nGOP Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel also fired back at Richmond, calling the remark “disgusting and offensive.” \n“A snarky joke for you is just a reminder of the demeaning comments women hear every single day. And trust me, it happens to all women,” McDaniel said , adding : “I’d suggest using Women’s History Month to lift us up instead of knocking us down.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T19:59:50.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
