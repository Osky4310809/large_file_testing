File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - New People’s Army (NPA) rebels have launched “planned and coordinated attacks” against soldiers despite the peace negotiations and the unilateral ceasefire, according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). \nIn a report to the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP), the AFP cited the attacks on soldiers in Isabela and several areas in Mindanao on Monday. \nTwo soldiers from the Army’s 86th Infantry Battalion, who were escorting villagers following up a tree-planting project at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources office, were killed in an ambush in Barangay Benguet in Echague town. \nIn Bukidnon, suspected NPA rebels lobbed grenades at soldiers engaged in relief operations for flood victims in Barangay Concepcion in Valencia City. \n“Fortunately, the grenades did not explode. This could have caused undue casualties and further misery to flood victims,” a report from Camp Evangelista in Patag, Cagayan de Oro City read. \nThe AFP said three soldiers were wounded in another attack by NPA rebels in Sitio Brazil in Barangay Mat-i in Surigao City.   \nNPA guerrillas also attacked peace and development teams in Barangays San Isidro, Mahayahay and Hinambangan in Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte. \nCol. Edgard Arevalo, AFP public affairs office chief, also demanded the release of Pvt. First Class Erwin Salam, who was seized while conducting community service in Algeria town in Isabela on Sunday. \n“We urge them to stop attacking the soldiers. These violate their own ceasefire declaration and are an assault to the communities and the people who seek assistance from the Army to improve their lives,” Arevalo said. \nLt. Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero, Eastern Mindanao Command chief, called on the Communist Party of the Philippines leadership to show sincerity in the peace talks by ordering their armed members to stop attacking soldiers. ‘Distressed, disturbed’ \nThe government is “distressed and extremely disturbed” by the series of attacks and harassment by NPA rebels, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza said. \n“The unilateral ceasefire was set in place to provide an enabling environment for the ongoing peace talks and secure the support of stakeholders and the public in understanding and supporting these unprecedented although small but significant steps for sustainable peace in the land,” Dureza said. \n“Either some in the National Democratic Front leadership talking to the government are not in control of their own forces on the ground, or they are undermining efforts for sustainable peace or pressuring the government for certain concessions,” he said. – With Edith Regalado, Jose Rodel Clapano  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:34:40.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
