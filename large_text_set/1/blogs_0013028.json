But luckily, you need not look any further than MUNCHIES, because we’ve compiled our list of LA’s most reliably delicious late-night eateries—the kinds of gems that will serve you affordable food and a little coffee well into the wee hours without any judgement. \nFor more ideas on where to eat, drink, and hang out in LA, check out the complete MUNCHIES Guide to LA . \nRuen Pair : At Ruen Pair, the pad thai is tender, never too sweet, and just what the doctor ordered to satiate you, especially when pair with their refreshing papaya salad. \nOB Bear : Spicy Korean-style fried chicken and dangerously smooth soju is the name of the game at this old-school Koreatown hangout. You will undoubtedly leave stuffed, happy, and with plenty of leftovers. \nCanter’s Deli : There is quite possibly no faster way to sober up after a crazy night out on the town than with a pastrami sandwich stacked high with thinly-sliced beef, chased with a cup of matzo ball soup. Make sure to buy a bag of rugelach and any other pastries on your way out that catch your eye for the painful morning after. \nThe Original Pantry Cafe : A downtown destination for nostalgia-inspiring diner food since 1924. You can grab a seat at the counter open 24 hours day, and enjoy American classics like pancakes or steak and eggs. \nWürstkuche : Very few simple edible pleasures in life can rival chowing down on a mountain of golden-brown, twice-fried pomme frites; a juicy grilled sausage on top of a bun; and a tall glass, filled to the brim, with a great ale. At Würstkuche, you can go crazy and get a sausage with rattlesnake in it! (It tastes like chicken). \nPacific Dining Cart : This OG fancy spot hasn’t closed its doors since 1923. It is the type of place where you go to splurge on a $38 aged, 6-ounce filet mignon at 3 AM, ‘nuff said. \nStout Burgers & Beer : Thick beef, chicken, or veggie patties that are ground daily on buttery brioche buns, and a “Goombah” burger option with smoked mozz, crispy prosciutto, and lemon-basil aioli make this restaurant an outlier in the scarce world of after-hours eateries in LA. Whatever you get, just make sure to chase with some of their always-crispy sweet potato fries. \nTo see the rest of our list of late-night eats—as well as tips for where to grab tacos, do some fine dining, or get drunk while in LA— check out the complete MUNCHIES Guide to Los Angeles .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:47:03.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
