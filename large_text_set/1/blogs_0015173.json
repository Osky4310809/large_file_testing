It was because the independence and sovereignty of a country, Ukraine, had been encroached upon by force by Russia,” Mr Obama told reporters at his final presidential press conference. \n“I think it will probably best serve not only American interests but also the interests of preserving international norms,” he added, “if we made sure that we don’t confuse why these sanctions have been imposed with a whole set of other issues.” Obama tells media: 'Our democracy needs you' \nMr Trump said that he would possibly work on a deal with the Russian government to lift sanctions imposed in 2014 following the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. \n“They have sanctions on Russia – let’s see if we can make some good deals with Russia,” Mr Trump told the London Times earlier this week. “For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that’s part of it.” \nPresident Obama signed the 2010 New START treaty negotiated with Russia, agreeing to limit the number of strategic, long-range nuclear weapons the countries can deploy.

But Exxon had to suspend operation in Russia as a result of the 2014 sanctions. \nMr Tillerson has come under fire for providing misleading answers about his role in lobbying against the sanctions while running the massive oil company in 2015 and 2016.
