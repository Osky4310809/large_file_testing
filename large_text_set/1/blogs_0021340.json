A honeymoon is a sanctioned sex vacay, and we all know it. The families and friends conspire to give the newly wed couple a week or so of uninterrupted bonking time, before they get bogged down with domestic woes. So, it is only justified to make the best of this time and do it like bunny rabbits whenever you want, and more importantly wherever you want (Because when you come back to homeland, you will not be able to strip down and get it on wherever you like). Here are eight spots you need to check off your list of 'been there, done that': The bathroom Chances are that your honeymoon suite has a fancy bathroom. Make use of the magnificent shower, the generous floor space, and that tub! The toilet in your airplane Because this time around, you won't get in trouble! All you have to do is flash your marriage certificate. The beach Don't do it for how good it feels (because sand in the crevices of your backside doesn't feel all that great). Do it for the background score of ocean waves, and the scenic view of the horizon. A bar Maybe going all the way in a crowded bar is not such a great idea, but some naughty action under the table would not hurt! The balcony Because you must experience that moment when the lustful urges are so strong that they can't wait for you to take ten steps to your bed inside the room. In a rented car So that you don't have to worry about getting it dry cleaned later. The swimming pool at your hotel That's just how honeymooners spend lazy sunny afternoons. Didn't you know? In a changing room You were shopping. You get horny. What else are you supposed to do?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:22:11.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
