The victims were released after they paid P7.7 million, according to the group. \nA 24-year-old son of a Philippine Stock Exchange officer was reported kidnapped on Jan. 5. The MRPO did not give details on the fate of the victim.   \nLast December, a fruit dealer from Sto. Cristo in Binondo, Manila was kidnapped by unidentified men and was released after paying P5 million. \nOne detailed case reported by the MRPO involved 46-year-old Zhao Xin Min, who arrived in the country on Nov. 6 last year. The following day, eight policemen broke into his hotel room in Sta. Cruz, Manila and demanded P3 million. \nThe victim’s uncle delivered P1 million to the policemen in a comfort room at a mall in Binondo. \nDespite the pay-off, Zhao was hauled in for inquest on Nov. 9 on drug charges. \nThe policemen who charged him were seen in CCTV footage withdrawing money from his ATM account at a bank in Binondo. They also took his vehicle from the hotel. \nNational Capital Region Police Office chief Director Oscar Albayalde, in a meeting with Zhao, his lawyers and representatives of the Federation of the Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry last year, promised to conduct an investigation into the rogue cops, the MRPO said. \nThe MRPO said the victims refused to cooperate with the PNP as many of the kidnappers come from their ranks. \nSen. Panfilo Lacson, chairman of the Senate committee on public order and safety, prodded the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group to speed up their investigation into the cases.
