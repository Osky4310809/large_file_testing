I spent five years in his class at school, for him it's totally out of character. \n\"I am in shock... I'm surprised he turned and did what he did.\" \nMasood's criminal career dated back to 1983 and included convictions for assault, GBH and possession of an offensive weapon. \nThis led him to spend time behind bars at Lewes Prison in East Sussex, Wayland Prison in Norfolk and Ford open prison in West Sussex. \nOne of his jail terms was a two-year stint for a fight in 2000 outside the Crown and Thistle in Northiam, near Rye in East Sussex that left a man needing 20 stitches in his face. \nThe report of the court case in the Brighton Argus said that Masood, who stood trial at Hove Crown Court as Adrian Elms, moved to the village \"to give his family and himself a better and more tranquil way of life\". \nAdrian Baker, 51, who has lived in Northiam for 25 years, told the Press Association on Friday that Elms was known as a \"troubled\" character. \n\"I'm gobsmacked. He didn't appear to be very religious. He would go into the local pubs,\" Baker said. \nThe Telegraph reported that Masood was jailed again three years later for stabbing another man. \nHe would later mask his life of crime with a CV which claimed he was an experienced English teacher who had worked across the world. \nThe document, seen by The Sun, lists Masood as a university-educated English teacher with experience working in places such as Saudi Arabia and Luton. \nIt is understood he never worked as a teacher in any of England's state schools. \nAt some point after his radicalisation he came to the attention of MI5, but only as a peripheral figure according to Prime Minister Theresa May. \nThe killer most recently appeared to be based in the West Midlands, but also spent time in London, Sussex and Luton. \nAfter his armed onslaught on Wednesday, police searched a three-storey townhouse in the Winson Green area of Birmingham and neighbours said Masood lived there for around seven months, until December last year. \nMasood is also thought to have lived in London, with a man of his name registered to an address in a terraced street in West Ham. \nA remote farmhouse in Trelech, Carmarthenshire, thought to be his parents' home, was also searched by police.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:34:20.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
