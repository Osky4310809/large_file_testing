As a result, Wells Fargo said it fired roughly 5,300 employees, most of whom were low-level. But some employees said their actions were the result of intense pressure from higher-ranking managers urging them to meet sales goals.\nThe four executives fired all had prominent roles within Wells Fargo’s retail-banking business — the division that deals with everyday, individual consumers. In addition to their termination, the executives were denied 2016 bonuses and will forfeit any unvested equity and stock options.\nAn internal investigation into the Wells Fargo’s sales-practices will continue, with a goal to reach a conclusion by April. “Any additional actions will be made public by that time,” the bank said.\n[ WSJ ]\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:24:06.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
