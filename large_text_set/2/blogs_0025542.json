They were probably made in Europe, possibly Germany or France.\nThe incredible haul was pulled from the ground in Staffordshire (Picture: PA) (Picture: PA) It is not known why the items were buried, but it could have been for safekeeping, as an offering to the gods, or as an act of remembrance after their owner died.\nThe decoration on the bracelet is thought to be some of the earliest Celtic art from Britain.\nTail of Storm Ewan whips UK with heavy snow Dr Julia Farley, curator of British & European Iron Age collections for the British Museum, said: ‘This unique find is of international importance. It dates to around 400-250 BC, and is probably the earliest Iron Age gold work ever discovered in Britain.\n‘The torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the continent who had married into the local community. Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.’\nThe find was spotted by lifelong friends Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania.\n(Picture: PA) Mr Hambleton used to go metal detecting when he was younger with his father, who told him to resurrect his old past-time after hearing he had started fishing.\nHe said: ‘I am so glad we took his advice and pleased of course that he got the chance to see these amazing pieces and prove he was right all along.’\nPolice response to Tunisia hotel terror attack was 'cowardly' The pair have said they plan to split any proceeds with the farming family which owns the 640 acres of land where the finds were discovered.\nStaffordshire County Council leader Philip Atkins said: ‘As a county and as a council we are both proud and unbelievably lucky to be home to some truly exceptional finds, including of course the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold.\n(Picture: PA) ‘This amazing find of gold torcs in the north of the county is quite simply magical and we look forward to sharing the secrets and story they hold in the years to come.’\nSchoolgirl died from asthma attack while running to catch a tram The finds have been handed over to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, part of Birmingham Museums, which manages the voluntary recording of finds.\nAn inquest will be held at 11am in North Staffordshire, where Coroner Ian Smith will rule if the pieces are treasure.\nThe pieces will then be provisionally valued by an expert.\nJoe Kania and Mark Hambleton made the discovery (Picture: PA)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:54:24.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
