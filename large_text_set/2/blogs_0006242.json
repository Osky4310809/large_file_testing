It’s February, and you’re all probably well into your resolutions for the year. One of my resolutions is to play even more games — and to make sure that you and your friends get the chance to as well.\nI’m happy to share that from February 12 through February 25, you can pick up the new, slimmer PS4 in either the Uncharted 4 PlayStation 4 bundle, or the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare PS4 bundle for $249.99. Additionally, if you order the exclusive Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare PS4 bundle in Glacier White through Walmart.com, you’ll also receive this price promotion for $249.\n\nHere are the options to choose from:\nThe Uncharted 4 PS4 bundle includes the slimmer PS4 model with a 500GB HDD, a DualShock 4 wireless controller, and the critically acclaimed Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End. The Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare PS4 bundle comes with the slimmer 500GB PS4 and a DualShock 4 wireless controller, along with the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Blu-ray disc, and a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered download voucher. The Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare PS4 bundle in Glacier White comes with the slimmer Glacier White 500GB HDD PS4 and matching Glacier White DualShock 4 wireless controller, along with the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Blu-ray disc and a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered download voucher.
