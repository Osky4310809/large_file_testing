Wood has been writing about the atmosphere for The Inquirer for 26 years. More by Anthony R. Wood Arrow icon \nIn a nine-hour period, 2 feet of snow piled upon Downingtown on this date in 1987, and that total was legitimate: It came from the head of the local National Weather Service office at the time, Chet Henricksen. \nSnowfall totals varied throughout the region, typical in a late-season heavy snow with borderline temperatures, with 6.5 inches measured officially at Philadelphia International Airport, and reports of two and three times that amount in elevated areas of the city. \nIt also was typical of late-season storms in that once it stopped by mid-morning, it disappeared from the sun-warmed streets in a hurry, and wasn’t nearly as disruptive as a daytime snowstorm a month earlier. \nBut winters around here haven’t been quite the same since that February 1987 coastal storm pulled away. \nGlobal temperatures, as everyone agrees, are higher these days than they were back then. \nIn the 30-year period ending in 1987, worldwide temperatures were about 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit above 20 th Century averages, compared with just under 1 degree above in the last 30 years, according to the National Center for Environmental Information. \nWarming in Philadelphia winters, however, has been more robust. The 30 winters ending with 1987 saw an average temperature of 32.7 Fahrenheit -- the coolest such period in records dating to 1874. \nBy comparison, the average for the last 30 was 36 Fahrenheit, the warmest such period. \nAs we’ve noted, when this meteorological winter —December-January-February — is over, six of the 10 warmest meteorological winters will have occurred since 1987. \nAt the same time, the region has experienced some of the biggest snowstorms on record. \nThis is not necessarily a paradox, and some researchers have been looking hard at the connection between warming and stronger snowstorms. \nSo far this winter, however, all we’ve had is the warming.
