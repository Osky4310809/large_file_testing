Almost 1,400 women work there. Many thousand more are alumnae. \nFor better or for worse, the environment shapes their time at Baylor — and their futures. \nSo, what is it really like to be a woman on campus? Six Baylor women, divided by the allegations against their university, share their experiences. ‘Baylor is really heavy on the purity culture’ — April Fleming, class of 2015 (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nApril Fleming once went to the Baylor health clinic to seek treatment for a yeast infection. \nWhat she got, she said, was a shaming. \nFleming recalled how the nurse practitioner asked about her sexual history, then grabbed her hand. “Oh, honey,” the nurse told her. “I know there’s a lot of pressure on girls these days ... but if you tell your boyfriend you don’t want to have sex, if he really loves you, he won’t break up with you.” \nThe nurse then falsely suggested Fleming might have syphilis, in what Fleming believes was a scare tactic. \n“Baylor is really heavy on the purity culture,” said Fleming, now 24. That culture, she said, teaches women that they are “like a piece of gum. Every time somebody chews you, you get more gross or lose your stickiness.” \nIt’s because of that mentality, Fleming said, that she did not realize she had been sexually assaulted at the end of her junior year. \nShe’d had a bad day, the kind that ends in tears. But when she turned to her boyfriend for help, she said, he seemed turned on. She recalled how he pinned her arms to the bed. When she tried to push him away, she said, he climbed on top of her and rubbed against her until he was satisfied. \nFleming blamed herself for not saying “no” more forcefully. It wasn’t until she interned in Washington, D.C., where she learned about feminism and what it truly means to consent, that she gathered the strength to break up with him. \n“If somebody is saying ‘this isn’t the Baylor I knew,’ they were lucky enough not to be one of the victims or not to know the victims,” Fleming said of the scandal. “Because honestly, when it came out, I wasn’t that surprised.” ‘Women are treated differently at Baylor ... in the sense that they are treated better’ — Brittany Gamlen, vice chair of Baylor Young Conservatives of Texas Brittany Gamlen stands outside the Texas State Capitol, where she's interning as a legislative aide to Republican state Rep. Cole Hefner. (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nBrittany Gamlen sees Baylor as a place where men hold doors open for female students. They ask women out to dinner, even bring them flowers. \n“Women are treated differently at Baylor than they are at other schools in the sense that they are treated better,” said Gamlen, a 20-year-old political science major and vice chair of the school’s Young Conservatives of Texas group. \nThough Gamlen is one of several women who say she has been cat-called on campus — the target of a whistle or a “damn, girl” while walking to the library — she views that as an unfortunate outlier, the result of a sexualized culture that does not talk enough about marriage. \n“It’s kind of like, I guess boys will be boys,” she said. “It’s not right, but I don’t think it’s enough of a problem where you can jump from that conclusion to there’s a whole problem with the way men treat women on campus.” \nShe lauded Baylor for being an “equal opportunity” university. She does not want extra support as a woman, she said, only to succeed based on her merits. This semester, she’s interning in Austin as a legislative aide to Republican state Rep. Cole Hefner. \nGamlen, who also works as an athlete tutor, said her experience with football players and the Baylor community overall makes it hard to believe recent allegations that as many as 31 football players committed at least 52 acts of rape . \n“I think there were probably a few unfortunate events that misrepresented Baylor,” she said, “and it kind of got blown out of proportion.” 'There's a certain amount of privilege that comes with feeling at home in the Baylor nation' — Dr. Emma Wood, former staff psychologist \nDr. Emma Wood, a former staff psychologist who is eight months pregnant with her third child, described a \"chilly climate\" at Baylor for feminists and working moms. (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nBaylor's sexual assault scandal did not come as a shock to Dr. Emma Wood, a psychologist in the school's counseling center from 2010 to 2016. Sexual violence, she said, is the ultimate expression of a campus culture that subtly demeans women. \nThe 34-year-old, who has tattoos, recently dyed her hair purple and identifies as a feminist, described a \"chilly climate\" on campus for those who don't conform to traditional gender roles. \n\"There's a certain amount of privilege that comes with feeling at home in the Baylor nation,\" Wood said. \nOnce, a male psychologist derided her work as \"rah-rah women are great\" therapy, Wood said. When she expressed concern over the comment, she said, she was told she was being too sensitive. \nWhen she got calls to pick up an ill daughter from day care, she recalled, her colleagues asked, \"Can't you get someone else to take care of your child?\" \nAnd when Wood was passed over for a promotion last year, she said, it was because she was \"too emotional\" and out of the office too much with her children. Baylor declined to comment, as is its policy on personnel issues. \n\"I was being punished essentially for all of the ways that I am,\" Wood said. \"Being too liberal, being too vocal about things, being a mom and having my sick time be treated differently than someone who was out because their leg was broken.\" \nIt reached the level of harassment and discrimination last year, Wood said. She was transferred from the counseling department, then resigned in November as part of a financial agreement with the university. She's now in private practice and eight months pregnant with her third child. \n\"Leaving,\" she said, \"has been the best decision I ever made.\" 'Once you start seeing signs of sexism, you see it everywhere' — May Kearney, junior (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer \nMay Kearney can feel the stares when she walks into a classroom. Perhaps it’s her short pixie haircut, unorthodox for the Baptist campus. Or maybe it’s the way she raises her hand in class, pushing back against male professors and speaking out about perceived sexism. \n“You have to fit in — that’s the culture,” said Kearney, 21, who is also an atheist and active in the LGBT community on campus. “If you don’t fit in, you’re punished.” \nWhile at Baylor, Kearney said, she has reported three gender-related incidents to faculty, an administrator or the Title IX office. \nIn one case, she said, a male student gave her unwanted attention on a study abroad trip, even after she rebuffed his advances. In another, she said, a male professor degraded women and other minorities in class, then called her \"crazy\" for reporting him. \nIn the third case, she said, a male professor bought her comic books as a gift, complimented female students on their looks, and, she suspects, raised her final grade from a C to a B. She worried he bumped the grade not because she earned it, but because he was interested in her. \n“Once you start seeing signs of sexism, you see it everywhere,” said Kearney, who belongs to an online group of Baylor feminists. \nWhile many students appreciate the campus custom of men opening doors for women, Kearney has seen that culture break down because of her androgynous look. Men on campus often falter when they see her coming through a doorway, she said, unsure of what to do. \n“It’s nice to have a boy open the door for me, but if he’s doing it because I’m a woman I don’t think it’s appropriate,” Kearney said. “You should be opening the door because you’re a human being, and I’m standing right behind you waiting to go inside.” 'When I got here, it was like I was free to fly' — Aspen Fisher, president of Baylor Women in Business (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nAspen Fisher considers herself the typical Baylor woman. \nShe grew up Christian, in a Texas suburb. Her father worked as a small business owner; her mother as a teacher. In high school, she said, she was nominated for homecoming queen. \n\"Just the average, middle-class American,\" she said. \"I feel like I fit that mold, and I feel like that's Baylor's target market.\" \nOnce at Baylor, Fisher dived into life on campus. She co-chaired a conference for black student government, tried intramural volleyball for fun and now serves as president of Baylor Women in Business, a club that invites women from corporate America to talk with students. \n\"When I got here,\" she said, \"it was like I was free to fly.\" \nFisher, 20, hopes to work for a Big Four accounting firm after graduation. She said she has an internship lined up at PricewaterhouseCoopers — an accomplishment she attributes, in part, to the strength of the Baylor brand. \nHer experience there has been \"100 percent positive,\" but, she knows, that can't take away from the experiences of those who have suffered. \nAfter the sexual assault scandal broke, three family members bought her mace. Everyone wanted to know, \"Do you feel safe on campus?\" She hesitated to wear her Baylor sweatshirt on a trip to Kroger, then put it on anyway. \n\"My first instinct was to protect,\" she said. \"I'm always proud of this university.\" 'For a woman to stand up in the '70s and say, 'That man raped me' was just unthinkable' — Mary Duty, class of 1972 (Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News) \nMary Duty attended Baylor from 1969 to 1972, when dancing was banned, students weren't allowed to lie on the quad with the opposite sex and women could only wear skirts that fell below the knee. \nStill, it was college, and Duty remembers students having plenty of sex — some consensual, some not. \n\"People were getting drunk and getting raped at parties in the '70s and we had nowhere to go,\" Duty said. Women sought contraception and help for unplanned pregnancies at Planned Parenthood, she said, and kept sexual assaults quiet so that the school wouldn't kick them out for being \"unclean.\" \n\"For a woman to stand up in the '70s and say, 'That man raped me' was just unthinkable,\" she said. \nDuty, 66, is now a leader in the Waco community. She taught middle school history for nearly two decades, volunteers with veterans and chairs the McLennan County Democratic Party. \nShe and her husband also own Poppa Rollo's Pizza, nestled between an Arby's and an EZ Pawn about 10 minutes from campus. With its colorful arcade and $5.99 lunch special, it's a local institution that employs Baylor students and even subscribes to the student newspaper, Duty said. When Baylor athletics do well, she said, \"the cash registers sing.\" \nStill, Duty worries. \"I don't think it's worth it at the price of someone's dignity.\" \nDuty's grandfather and mother went to Baylor, and she sent two children there. Her blood runs green and gold, always will. Yet she fears the school has lost its way. \n\"It's awful to watch,\" Duty said. \"I just keep thinking about the scripture: 'Pride goes before the fall.' Either Shakespeare or Jesus said it. We got mighty full of ourselves, and then we were brought to our knees.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:37:37.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
