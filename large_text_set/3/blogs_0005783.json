(Derrick Goold photo / Post-Dispatch) TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • The old man makes young men kids and big men small. \nAdam Wainwright, the mountain on the mound, opened the clubhouse door Tuesday, walked out upon his evergreen domain, spotted Bob Gibson and was suddenly 10 again. \n“‘There’s Mr Gibson, I have to go talk to him,’” Wainwright recalled thinking. “So I did.” \nSometimes, we get too inside baseball. We love getting lost in it — some more than others, anyway — striding through strategy and statistics and storylines, and yes, you’ll continue to get analysis from this very column space, but you know what? Bob Gibson came Tuesday, so let’s talk about Bob Gibson. \n“He’s the bar,” Cardinals pitcher Marco Gonzales said. \nHe’s 81 now. Cards fans born the day of Gibson’s final start — Sept. 3, 1975 — are now 41. So no one under 40 was alive when Gibson pitched; and Gibson has lived a little more than half his life since his last pitch. But dang it if Bob Gibson doesn’t still carry himself like Bob Gibson. Spry, spunky — a spitfire. A couple of months ago, he stole the show at the annual St. Louis Baseball Writers’ Dinner, throwing brushback insults at old opponents, describing his bursting competitiveness with anecdotes such as: “I hated losing — I didn’t like my little girls beating me in dominoes.” Or, when describing the 6-foot-7 Wainwright that night: “Let me tell ya. If I were his size, I’d walk into home plate and just slap somebody. For no reason. Just because I could.” \nOn Tuesday, at spring training, No. 50 approached No. 45. \n“I really just try to listen as much as I can,” Wainwright said. “I don’t want to fill the box with too many of my words, when he has stuff to say.” \nGibson wore a short-sleeved white collared shirt, made by Nike’s Jordan Brand — I bet Michael Jordan would’ve loved watching Bob Gibson pitch — but Wednesday he’s likely to wear the Cardinals uniform, and just knowing that should make the day a little sweeter. Now, one wonders if Gibson himself will find this white-and-red robing a ceremonial moment, important to a legion of strangers, or if he’ll look down at the pants and jersey and socks and belt and think: “Really, you really want me to put all of this on?” \nHere’s thinking he won’t be a Pollyanna in polyester, and that’s fair and fitting because that’s not who he is. He’s simultaneously real and blunt, while also larger than life with this mystique to him. \nI mean, at this point, it’s as if we’ve placed a halo above his hat, but surely he doesn’t know it’s there, because he’d swat that thing away if so. \nThere is an aura to Gibson. He’s the St. Louis athlete you whisper to your friend — there he is. It was fascinating watching Cardinals people gravitate to Gibson — or navigate around Gibson, as if not to rattle the moment. Gibson turned down a reporter’s interview request but greeted all who came his way. Dexter Fowler was introduced to Gibson. The smiling face of the franchise meeting the famously scowling face of the franchise. Gibson did smile wide when chatting with the former Cub, making small-talk while informing Dex: “Glad you’re here with a real organization.” \nManager Mike Matheny used the word “honor” to describe Gibson’s arrival from Omaha, Neb. Matheny said Gibson “has got some thoughts” after watching a recent Cards game on TV. The skipper joked Gibby would have “a novel” of notes to share, and “I can’t wait to hear them.” Matheny told Gibson that, if you can believe it, some guys are intimidated by him. He encouraged Gibson to chat with the players, and later Tuesday morning, he was hanging in the clubhouse, talking pitching with some wide-eyed millionaires. \n“He’ll be in a conversation,” Matheny said, “and I’ll hear years later about a guy who was three people away, overhearing the conversation, and got something from it. Then it’s: ‘I heard from Bob Gibson this ...’ It carries some weight. It’s just part of passing on the tradition and the history around here. \n“... I mean he’s a big personality. Not a big personality in being outspoken necessarily, but you just know his résumé and his reputation. He’s just one of a kind. There’s just so many things I’ve seen. He was talking earlier how he spent some time with Darryl Kile and how much of an influence Darryl Kile was on Chris Carpenter and some of the conversations they had. You could see some of that tenacity. I think it’s inherent with a couple of those guys, but you see that being passed on right down the line.” \nFrom Gibson to the late Kile. From Kile to Carp to Wainwright, and you know Waino shares as much as he can with anyone wearing the birds on the bat. \nTrevor Rosenthal said Gibson has given him tips on pitching to righthanded hitters. Gonzales said he sometimes watches Gibson highlights online, absorbing “that attitude and energy” through the grainy footage. And Mitch Harris says his buddies often chide him about “The Cardinal Way,” so Harris will then tell them about the human heirlooms. \n“These guys don’t just show up because someone is paying them to come out here,” Harris said. “It’s a big deal for them. … Some of the young guys, I don’t know if it’s hit them yet — and it might not for a while — that you’re sitting in the same clubhouse as someone of that caliber. It’s one of those things that you better be careful not to take for granted, because it’s a special thing that we have here.” \nBenjamin Hochman", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:00:02.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
