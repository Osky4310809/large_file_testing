Orangutans are endangered, as many of you know. If every one of you who has viewed his video donated just ¬£1 to the Orangutan Foundation we could raise an amazing amount of money to help support these amazing and majestic animals in the wild. Simply text APES05 ¬£X to 70070 (where X is the amount you would like to donate, e.g. text APES05 ¬£20 to 70070 to donate ¬£20). Let's take this incredible moment and make an even bigger impact, in the hope that one day my baby will be able to see these phenomenal creatures in the wild, safe from harm. http://www.orangutan.org.uk\nA video posted by Morgain Fae (@morgain_fae) on Dec 14, 2016 at 6:04am PST\nPretty darn adorable, right?\nOddly, this isn't the first time an orangutan has kissed a pregnant woman's belly at a British zoo, either.\nBONUS: Forest school rescues orangutan orphans, teaches them to survive in the wild", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BOAA-9Rjbg8/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/i2QHyVIb.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/i2QHyVIb.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-05T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:40:50.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
