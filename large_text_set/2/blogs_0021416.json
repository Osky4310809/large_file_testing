According to French magazine Le 10 Sport (h/t Charles Perrin of the Daily Express ), the 22-year-old has been linked with both the Red Devils and Chelsea , but the Gunners are now alleged to be in the hunt for his services. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has had to deal with absences in midfield this season, first loaning Jack Wilshere to Bournemouth before Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin both endured injury concerns. Bakayoko could improve the engine-room options in that regard, and Squawka recently broke down the general's league season thus far, showing just how varied and versatile an asset he has proved himself to be:   Tiemoué Bakayoko's Ligue 1 season by numbers: 46 interceptions 45 take-ons completed 45 aerial duels won 44 tackles won Midfield monster. https://t.co/RQ3KfSQvG6 2/16/2017, 1:36:20 PM According to Perrin, United manager Jose Mourinho considered a January bid for Bakayoko, while Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has the Frenchman lined up as a potential replacement for Cesc Fabregas . It helps Arsenal's plight that Bakayoko already seems quite willing to leave for the right offer, having recently told French daily Le Parisien (h/t Get French Football News ) he'd be ready to leave Monaco for Paris Saint-Germain: \nI had a trial in an international tournament in Nimes and we played against Arsenal. The opportunity to sign for the PSG youth academy presented itself after Montrouge. But my dad and my brother chose Rennes , the best youth academy at the time. Not going to PSG hurt me, I even had tears in my eyes… If the opportunity presents itself, I will not refuse a move to PSG. But I am only 22, and I feel very good at Monaco. The Emirates Stadium may not be as desirable a destination as the Parc des Princes at present, however, meaning Arsenal could face trouble convincing their target a move to north London is for him. There's yet to be any mention as to how much the player would cost if Wenger were to return to former club Monaco for the anchor, although football writer Liam Canning teed him up as an intriguing talent: Liam Canning @LiamPaulCanning Monaco are so exciting to watch - already scored 110 goals this season. Bakayoko, Mbappé, Bernardo Silva and Fabinho ridiculously good. 2/21/2017, 8:37:04 PM Bakayoko's soar through the Monaco ranks has been timed accordingly with the club's rise back to their former glories in Ligue 1, as well as advancing well into the latter stages of this season's UEFA Champions League. As a result, the BBC's John Bennett joined the masses praising Bakayoko for   the club this season when speaking ahead of Monaco's 5-3 defeat at Manchester City on Tuesday evening: John Bennett @JohnBennettBBC Tiemoue Bakayoko is one (of many) players to watch in the Monaco team tonight. Very highly rated. Future star. #UCL #MCFC 2/21/2017, 2:23:46 PM Both United and Chelsea have spent heavily on transfers under new managers in the past year, meaning Arsenal could be forced to shell out big if they're to land their target this summer. It won't be a simple task to tempt Bakayoko away from the French Riviera, and Arsenal will need to beat some big-spending peers if they're to land one of Ligue 1's most promising up-and-comers this summer.
