Because, as Cardinals G.M. Steve Keim said during a recent appearance on PFT Live , Palmer is willing to mentor a young quarterback, it makes sense to bring a young quarterback into the fold which Palmer is still playing. \nIt therefore also makes sense for the Cardinals to be taking a close look at the incoming crop of signal callers. Which, as explained by Kent Somers of azcentral.com, they are doing. They’ll be doing it with private workouts. \n“I would stray away from Pro Days if I could ,” Keim said, via Somers. “They’ve become so big that you don’t have the individual attention you need. You’re wasting some time.” \nThe Cardinals will be investing some private time in working out Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and presumably the rest of the quarterbacks at the top of the class. \n“I think there are five or six really good arms in this draft,” coach Bruce Arians said, via Somers. “Whether there are five or six quarterbacks, that’s what we have to find out. I’m feeling more and more there are a couple of sleepers who, because of their offenses, didn’t show as much as they are capable of.” \nIn other words, folks are trying to make sure the perceived second or third cut of quarterbacks doesn’t include another Dak Prescott . Over the past decade or so, the Cardinals have done very well when acquiring established quarterbacks in the waning years of their careers (Palmer, Kurt Warner). They’ve struggled when drafting quarterbacks (Matt Leinart, John Skelton, Ryan Lindley, Logan Thomas ) or rolling the dice by trading for — and paying — and unproven guy (Kevin Kolb). \nThe stakes are high in 2017. The perennially downtrodden Cardinals have been competitive and relevant in recent years only when they’ve had Palmer and Warner. They need someone who will play as well as either guy, and stick around a lot longer.
