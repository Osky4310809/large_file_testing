He was discovered to have rented accommodation at Lafia for Abdullahi Isa, known for his notorious terrorist actions and his plan was to establish an effective base to conduct terrorism, kidnapping and robbery operations in Abuja, Minna, and other adjoining states. \n“On March 15, 2017, Nasiru Sani (a.k.a Osama) was arrested at Ahmadu Bello Way, Bauchi. He is a Boko Haram top commander, and discovered to have escaped from Bauchi Central Prison in October 2010 and hid in Maiduguri, Borno State. \n“Similarly, on the same March 13, 2017, at Jeka-da-Fari Market, Gombe State, Adamu Jibrin was arrested. He operated under the pseudo name of Dantata Sule and served as a middleman for Boko Haram members and their commanders, especially the one simply identified as Kanumbu.” \nAccording to the DSS, Adamu Jibrin along with Abdulazeez Umaru, who was arrested in Ngalda Town in Fika LGA, Yobe State on March 1 and Nuhu Usman, alias Okadigbo, who was arrested in Nagazi area in Adavi LGA, Kogi State on March 2, have allegedly confessed membership of the Boko Haram sect. \nOn February 2, 2017, one Suleiman Yahaya, who had been on the wanted list of security agencies was arrested during a raid in Potiskum LGA, Yobe State, for his role in several terrorist attacks in Borno and Yobe states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:30:05.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
