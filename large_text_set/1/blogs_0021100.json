As with the others, tech has helped make scientific endeavors global in scope, robust against interference, and accessible by billions — with or without the consent of the powers that be. That’s just one reason why the current administration’s efforts to muzzle scientific inquiry will fail. \nThe list of federal agencies having their online communications tampered with or outright shut down is growing: the EPA, the National Parks Service, the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, Transportation, and the Interior, among others. Because of the ham-handed way it was done, it’s obvious these agencies are being reined in specifically with regard to climate change. Good luck with that! \nFirst though, let’s dispel the possibility that we’re all jumping the gun here. This is a time of transition between administrations, after all. Why wouldn’t there be a few hiccups as things get rewired? Even major lapses like losing the entire Spanish version of the White House website could be bumps in the road. \nBut it isn’t a casual absence of, say, the words “solar,” “wind,” or “renewable” from the administration’s energy plan . \nNor is it accidental that there is no replacement for, or even a rebuttal of Obama’s climate change policy. \nNor that the National Parks Service was chastised after several tweets regarding climate change. \nNor that the CDC suddenly cancelled its conference on climate change. Latest Crunch Report Watch More Episodes \nNor that cabinet nominees repeatedly refused to acknowledge the existence or urgency of climate change. \nNor that many other agencies receiving communications restrictions of varying intensity have jurisdiction over things largely affecting or affected by climate change. \nNor that the EPA has been gagged, hobbled, told to remove its page on climate change, and now to have its studies vetted by the administration before release . \nThis isn’t stumbling through a transition, or getting talking points straight, or playing up one side of an issue; we can talk about other things, just not climate change. It’s systematic suppression by the government of information relating to a topic it considers dangerous. \nThere’s a word for that — a word frequently misused these days, but the correct word in this case: censorship. \nUnfortunately for the would-be censors, the days when that sort of thing worked are long past. The Streisand effect has for years proven the stronger force than even the most dedicated of information wranglers. But it won’t even get to that stage. You can’t just tell science to shut up.

It’s taken decades of research by thousands upon thousands of scientists all over the globe to arrive and strengthen the theory (in the sense that gravity and evolution are also theories) of anthropogenic climate change, or global warming if you prefer.
