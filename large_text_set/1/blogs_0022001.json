He was talking about that being a big priority.” \n‘That’s one of those ones where I think that the energy sector and our natural resources are an area where I think the president is very, very keen on making sure that we maximize our use of natural resources to America’s benefit,” Spicer continued. “It’s good for economic growth, it’s good for jobs, and it’s good for American energy.” \nHe declined to give a timeline when that might actually take place, explaining simply that he would not “get in front of the president’s executive actions.” \nTrump has reportedly long thought that restarting the DAPL’s construction should be allowed, particularly since early December, when the Army Corps of Engineers refused to grant an easement necessary for the project to proceed. \nAt the time, North Dakota Senator John Hoeven (R) explained in a statement that he had met with the then-President-elect, and that “Mr. Trump expressed his support for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has met or exceeded all environmental standards set forth by four states and the Army Corps of Engineers.” \nTrump had previously also voiced support for the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it the way to “make our country rich again.” (President Obama canceled the Keystone project in November 2015.) \nTrump’s enthusiasm for DAPL was initially scrutinized after it become known that he held stock in Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the project’s construction, which he reportedly sold over this past summer. Energy Transfer CEO Kelsey Warren was also a sizable donor to the Trump campaign, and told NBC News that “I’m 100 percent sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration.” \nTrump’s team addressed the potential conflict of interest, dismissing it as “nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans.” Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:42:28.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
