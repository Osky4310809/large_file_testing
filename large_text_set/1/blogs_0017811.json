When we were getting out of the car, two police officers approached showed us the badge and said they were detaining my husband,” Darya Lisova told RT. \nThe policemen immediately searched the programmer’s phone, notebook, and his tablet computer.

Russian diplomats are working “to protect the interests of the Russian citizen and provide him with the necessary consular assistance,” the embassy said in a statement. Meanwhile, his family has hired a lawyer. \n“We’ve already had two lawyers. The first could not cope with the responsibilities, so we hired a second. He is now familiarizing himself with the case. So far, we have not been able to figure out what exactly they suspect him of doing,” said Lisova. \nThe woman fears that Stanislav might be extradited to the US without a court ruling from Madrid. The Spanish authorities are refusing to share any details regarding the case, as the apparent arrest warrant came from Washington. \nThe FBI and Interpol have refused to reply to a request for information from RT, and the US State Department has also failed to comment. Simple kidnapping \nThe vice-president of the Russian subsidiary of the International Human Rights Committee, Alexander Ionov, has called Lisov’s detention a violation of the international law. \n“If Spain was preparing to detain our citizens on its territory, then the Russian side should have been notified in advance,” Ionov told RT. \nNoting that Spain and the United States have “very close relations” when it comes to extraditing citizens of third countries, Ionov said that Madrid “simplified the rules of international law to the detriment of human rights.” Read more Sorry, hackers, but squirrels winning the cyber war - security expert \nThe human rights representative also confirmed that, so far, Moscow and Lisov’s legal team haven’t been able to ascertain the official reason behind the Russian programmer’s detention, calling it simply a “kidnapping.” \nStanislav works as a systems administration specialist and website developer for a local firm in the Russian city of Taganrog. \nThis is not the first time a Russian computer specialist has been detained while abroad on behalf of the US. In October, the Czech Republic detained a Russian citizen suspected of hacking targets in the United States. \nRussia’s Foreign Ministry criticized the arrest at the time, saying it showed that Washington was mounting a global manhunt against Russian citizens. \nLisov’s arrest comes at a time when the US government and intelligence agencies are accusing Russia of having initiated a cyberattack campaign against Democratic Party organizations before the November 8 presidential election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T09:34:23.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
