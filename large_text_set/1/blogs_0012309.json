It was well done and funny, unlike another recent video done by an athlete with ties to the area. A two-time champion with the San Antonio Spurs, the 36-year-old called it a career in entertaining fashion.\nBut it turns out the boring Spurs have a pretty good sense of humor too, as they “retired” one of Bonner’s many flannel shirts in a private ceremony.\nIn a very cozy and private ceremony, today we retired @MattBonner_SAS 's flannel shirt. #ThankYou15 pic.twitter.com/BXW8NyZC0R \n— Manu Ginobili (@manuginobili) January 13, 2017 \nMatt Bonner's flanny was retired after the game tonight in a very special wicked-awesome ceremony🤣 #thankyoumatt pic.twitter.com/DZkvZNcDwF \n— Patrick Mills (@Patty_Mills) January 13, 2017 \n\n\nSeriously. This guy really liked flannel.\nMatt Bonner on new, lighter Warriors unis: \"I'm no fashionista, but I would prefer they be flannel.\" Love. This. Guy. #mys \n— Richard Oliver (@RichardCOliver) February 24, 2013 \n\nFinding out the Spurs are good at jokes is must’ve been like seeing Robert De Niro in Midnight Run for the first time after a career of dramatic acting. “Wait, the guy from The Godfather and Taxi Driver ? He has impeccable comic timing too? This didn’t seem possible and now I’d like more of it.”\n( h/t For The Win )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T16:43:49.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
