You can’t get enough of each other, everything is all sunshine and roses and you love going the extra mile to make them happy. In this period, there’s no funny noises, weird smells or general talk about how much goes into making ourselves smell great and look good. It’s a time of innocence. \nThen reality hits… she’s got an ass like a trombone with a smell to match, and your carefully waxed veneer of a hairless back, goes to the wayside and she realizes that you’re secretly a silverback gorilla and those monthly haircuts includes loads of hot wax. But how soon does that happen? How soon should it happen? When does all the nice stuff turn nasty? \nTo paraphrase a line from a popular children’s book: everybody poops, and farts, belches, has weird smells and their bodies do some strange things. When see our S/O do something like that for the first time, it can be devastating; the illusion is shattered and they become human. Whether it’s accidental or you get to that point organically, each couple has their own way about it. So what’s the norm? The folks over at Sapio Blog have taken it upon themselves to survey 2,000 people to see what everyone else is doing and if there are any deal-breakers on what disclosures are appropriate, and when a good time to get to that “special” level of intimacy is. \nLeave the bathroom door open, because we’re learning something new today. 2 Sapio Blog \nSo, based on the most common responses, this is when an appropriate time to bridge each level of intimacy is. For most, burping in front of your partner, not shaving legs, trimming the below-the-belt foliage, talking about exes and periods and even tell them they have B.O. is less than 3 months. On the plus side though, it’s appropriate to shower together, walk around naked, learn new tricks by watching porn together and get some voyeurism in at this time too. \nSo it all balances itself out. 3 Sapio Blog \nOnce you’re fully out of the honeymoon period, then the curtain drops and it gets more real. This is when it’s okay to fart, talk about your epic Taco Bell evacuation and even subtly adjust your speedbag in front of them. In return, this is also when you meet families, have your respective toothbrushes at each other’s house and get a pet name. On, and it’s okay to ugly cry here too, Kim Kardashian style. \nAfter that, in the 6 months to a year phase, there’s helping your partner with their body hair hygiene, saying ‘I love you,’ and the most sacred act of all… peeing in front of them. \nOh, and sharing keys and stuff like that too, I guess that’s a milestone or something. 4 Sapio Blog \nBut what about things you should never, ever, ever do? Most importantly, don’t blow your nose in the bedsheets (does anyone actually do this?) Second to that, don’t pick your partner’s nose. Those are the most important deal-breakers for those that were surveyed. \nAfter that, it’s some pretty obvious stuff. Unless you’re into water sports, don’t pee in the shower together, and don’t ever cut your fingernails in bed, and don’t check each other’s phone. \nThere are, however, some other things on the list that are surprising. Like pooping with the door open, or in front of your partner. Close to half of those surveyed said it was a deal breaker. Ok, 1 percenters… some of us couples have a passion for burritos and can only afford a place with one bathroom, so that happens early in a relationship and we don’t talk about it. We just turn on a fan and use an evergreen car air freshner. I also take offence to the 26% complaining about morning breath. After being married for almost 5 years, I love my wife, but I’m not getting up any earlier just to brush my teeth. I do that in the shower. After I wake up at a reasonable hour. 5 Sapio Blog \nFinally, there’s things that are definite no-no’s, when it comes to having sex with your partner. While some are okay with showering liberally, close to 40% said that not showering before oral sex is a turn off. Now, I’d argue that there’s a reasonable time limit. Nasty stank is one thing, but I’m not down with tasting Dove soap either. Use your judgement. The same goes for period sex. For some, it’s not a big deal at all. \nFinally, almost 17% of the surveyed were against masturbating in front of their partner, while 15% thought that watching porn was a solo activity. Those are the boring couples and I think they’re in the wrong survey.

Some advice: keep the romance alive as long as possible, and take the personal, vulnerable and epically gross stuff slow. Dish out the disgusting stuff a little at at time, and by the one year mark, let it all hang loose. As you built trust, comfort and a solid relationship, the occasional slipped fart and rank pit, won’t deter you from jumping in the shower for some sexy times. \nJust don’t take a shit while they’re around, or it’s a solo show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:39:58.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
