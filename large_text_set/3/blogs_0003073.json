Lisa announced her pregnancy a couple of months ago and ever since then the actress has been sharing some really hot pictures with that bump. Although she isn’t making stylish appearances every other day like Kareena Kapoor Khan, who took the internet to storm with her pregnancy, just by the way, Lisa is redefining sexy in her own way with these pics. The gorgeous babe announced her pregnancy just a couple of months ago and ever since then she has been treating fans with some wonderful pictures. Last month Lisa was holidaying in Phuket. In those bikini pics too, she didn’t shy away from showing off that baby bump. So cool, no? If you look at her pictures lately, the baby bump is pretty much evident now than before. Doesn’t she look breathtakingly hot in this new pic? Let’s hope that just like Bebo, Lisa too treats us with countless stunning pregnancy photos.. \nIn the pic she is seen wearing a cute white dress. She captioned the pic as “Polaroids” on her Insta handle. Lisa, you make a really pretty mommy! Don’t you guys think so too? Just like her marriage, Lisa announced her pregnancy all of a sudden. Of course we were happy for her but it came to us as a pleasant surprise when she made the big announcement on social media a few months ago. Lisa got hitched to Dino Lalvani, who is the son of famous businessman Gullu Lalvani. The actress was last seen in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil which also starred Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anushka Sharma and Fawad Khan in lead roles.
