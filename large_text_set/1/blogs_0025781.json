Amazon offers free two-day shipping through Prime, which costs $99 a year.\n“In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes. It no longer makes sense to charge for it,” Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. eCommerce, said in a statement .\nWalmart's two-day shipping will require a minimum purchase of $35, down from $50. Without Prime, Amazon customers have to same spend $49 for free shipping that takes longer than two days.\nSEE ALSO: Amazon launches a credit card just for Prime members\nWalmart bought Lore's Jet.com, an Amazon e-commerce competitor, for $3 billion in August. The acquisition was seen as a major play against Amazon.\n\"We are moving at the speed of a startup,\" Lore said. “Two-day free shipping is the first of many moves we will be making to enhance the customer experience and accelerate growth.”\nWalmart's no-membership free shipping will be a major play against Amazon, but Prime membership still comes with a host of other benefits that Walmart can't provide, including original TV series and music streaming. And free shipping through Prime doesn't require a minimum purchase.\nAmazon has also been launching Prime around the world . Walmart's 2-day shipping will be available in U.S., excluding Alaska and Hawaii.\nBONUS: You can now take selfies... with your feet?", "external_links": ["http://news.walmart.com/2017/01/31/walmart-launches-free-two-day-shipping-on-more-than-two-million-items-no-membership-required", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ouBql3iq.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ouBql3iq.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-31T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:41:29.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
