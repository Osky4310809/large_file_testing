It had star athletes from sports other than basketball competing in a dunk contest. \nI know that Sanders was extremely athletic but it’s still impressive to see the 5 foot 8 inch tall football star dunk a basketball. \nOther athletes that you will see in the video are Ken Griffey Jr and Delino DeShields.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:44:27.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
