Pence's AOL account was subjected to a phishing scheme last spring, before he was chosen by Donald Trump to join the GOP presidential ticket. Pence's contacts were sent an email falsely claiming that the governor and his wife were stranded in the Philippines and needed money.\nThe governor moved to a different AOL account with additional security measures, Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said, but has since stopped using the new personal account since he was sworn-in as vice president.\nRecords show EPA's Pruitt used private email, despite denial at confirmation hearing Michael Biesecker, Sean Murphy Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt occasionally used private email to communicate with staff while serving as Oklahoma's attorney general, despite telling Congress that he had always used a state email account for government business.A review of Pruitt emails obtained by...\nEnvironmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt occasionally used private email to communicate with staff while serving as Oklahoma's attorney general, despite telling Congress that he had always used a state email account for government business.A review of Pruitt emails obtained by...\n(Michael Biesecker, Sean Murphy) Lotter said Pence \"maintained a state email account and a personal email account\" like previous governors in the state. At the end of his term Pence directed outside counsel to review all of his communications to ensure that state-related emails were transferred and properly archived by the state, the spokesman said.\nAs Trump's running mate, Pence frequently criticized rival Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, accusing her of purposely keeping her emails out of public reach and shielding her from scrutiny.\nLotter said \"the comparison is absurd\" because Clinton had set up a private server in her home at the start of her tenure at the State Department and, unlike Clinton, Pence did not handle any classified material as Indiana's governor.\nThe newspaper reported that the office of Pence's successor, Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, released more than 30 pages from Pence's AOL account, but declined to release an unspecified number of emails because they were considered confidential.\nSecurity experts noted to the Indy Star that some of Pence's emails were apparently sensitive enough that they could not be turned over in response to public records requests.\n\"The fact that these emails are stored in a private AOL account is crazy to me,\" Justin Cappos, a computer security professor at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, told the Indy Star. \"This account was used to handle these messages that are so sensitive they can't be turned over in a records request.\"\nPublic officials are not barred from using personal email accounts under Indiana law, but the law is interpreted to mean that any official business conducted on private email must be retained to comply with public record laws.\nThe state requires all records pertaining to state business to be retained and available for public information requests. Emails involving state email accounts are captured on the state's servers, but any emails that Pence may have sent from his AOL account to another private account would need to be retained.\nAt the end of his term, Pence hired the Indianapolis law firm of Barnes & Thornburg to conduct a review of all of his communications and that review is still ongoing, Lotter said. Any correspondence between Pence's AOL account and any aides using a state email account would have been automatically archived, he said.\nThe Washington Post contributed. \n  Mike Pence Hillary Clinton Donald Trump", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T14:07:21.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
