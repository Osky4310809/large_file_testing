Trump greets FBI Director James Comey during First Responders ceremony at the White House: “He’s become more famous than me.” pic.twitter.com/9Rdgyqi1iM \n— ABC News (@ABC) January 22, 2017 \nDuring a reception for law enforcement officials at the White House, President Trump gave a special shoutout to FBI Director James Comey . \nTrump was holding a ceremony inside the Blue Room on Sunday, where he honored security officials who helped with the inauguration. Trump eventually spotted Comey in the crowd, and he beckoned the FBI director to come over to him. \n“He’s become more famous than me,” Trump quipped before shaking hands with Comey and patting him on the back. \nTrump and Comey have had a complicated relationship with each other for the past several months. During the election, Trump applauded Comey after he sent a letter to Congress which stated that the FBI was re-opening their investigation into Hillary Clinton ‘s email server scandal. Comey said days later that the FBI would not change their decision about not prosecuting Clinton, which caused Trump to blast Comey . \nMultiple media observers have said that Comey’s 11th hour bombshell was a significant contributing factor to Clinton’s election defeat. While the FBI said that they didn’t find any new, relevant information with their new investigation, many Democrats have said that Comey’s first letter crippled Clinton’s momentum. \nWatch above, via ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T04:26:51.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
