When we arrive now in the Premier League, in the Cup, in the Champions League, if something happens with the injuries we don’t have enough. \nNasri could face four-year doping ban \n\"We are evaluating if there’s a chance to take one. I know Holger, he’s a fantastic player, a fantastic guy, but he’s a Bayern Munich player, and we should first of all speak with them and with him. \n\"Now on the table there are no names because we had a lot of games, but now we have 10 days off, 10 days until Everton, so we have time to discuss with Txiki [Begiristain, City director of football], with the club, what is the best for the rest of the season.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T01:47:48.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
