(Christina House / For The Times) (Joel Rubin) \nThe gathering came days after thousands rallied at Los Angeles International Airport as attorneys scrambled to file documents to free those detained. City Atty. Mike Feuer , who had been concerned that federal officials were not complying with a judicial order that prevented detainees from being deported, said earlier that he witnessed a “breathtaking violation of rights” at the airport. \nHe also was repeatedly denied access to federal detainees or an attorney who could discuss the situation, he said. \nOn Wednesday, Feuer announced that a team of lawyers in his office were “looking at every step we can effectively take to defend our values.” \n“I feel so strongly that this moment right now may be the defining moment in our lives,” he added. “The real America needs to rise up and make itself heard.” \nThe chairwoman of the Islamic Center said the words of city leaders have given her hope, but that she still wakes up in fear. \n\"When our policymakers say Islam hates us … they paintbrush a whole faith,” Hedab Tarifi said. “It worries me that a war is being waged that has no foundation.\" \nSalam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said he fields calls from people worried about traveling and being caught up in a nightmare. \nHe puts them in touch with legal help and encourages them to continue on with their plans. \n“The problem is, when you scapegoat a whole community, you do not bring security to the American people, you only bring more fear and hysteria,” he said. \nAll community members are invited to a rally beginning at the Islamic Center scheduled for Feb. 19 that intends to \"underscore the point of pluralism,\" he said. We are brothers, we are sisters with one another, and we are, as a city, one. — Ron Galperin, Los Angeles city controller \nMayor Eric Garcetti asked the city to acknowledge that it has long been a haven for immigrants and that the current fight involves legal residents who have gone through the “painstaking” process of filing the proper documents. \nHe compared the fight against Trump’s order to the civil rights movement. \n“This isn’t about fighting one person,” Garcetti said, “this is about standing up for joint values. … Everybody deserves to be at the lunch counter.” \nCity Controller Ron Galperin recalled how his father, who escaped Romania during the Holocaust, made his way through Turkey, Syria and Lebanon before landing at a British internment camp in Israel, which was then Palestine. \nHis father's plans to immigrate to the United States were hindered by restrictions during the Cold War. A U.S. senator heard of his plight and pushed legislation that allowed him to arrive in 1956. \nGalperin, the first in his family to be born an American, said he feels a responsibility to make sure others have the same opportunity. \n“We are brothers, we are sisters with one another, and we are, as a city, one.\" Caption  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:12:27.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
