We will sell high-end brands, quality not quantity, best products only.\" Those products include locally sourced produce, wine, and coffee from private-label brands. \nEach store will be between 30,000 and 36,000 square feet, which is about double the size of an average Aldi, Business Insider says. But though it's trying to set itself apart from its rival, Lidl and Aldi share some unmistakable similarities: Both brands ask customers to bring their own shopping bags to the store, and to bag their own groceries. Loyal customers likely won't mind, however, as that's just one way Lidl keeps its prices so low.
