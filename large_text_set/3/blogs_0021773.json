(Tony Powell) \nThe arts spark creativity and soothe divisiveness, Ford Foundation President Darren Walker told a packed house at The Kennedy Center on Monday night in a passionate address that defended art as essential to democracy. \n“Art is not a privilege. It is the soul of our country, the beating heart of our humanity,” Walker said. “And in these times, these menacing, perilous challenging times, we need the arts and humanities more than ever before.” \nWalker addressed a gathering of artists, arts administrators and other civic leaders who are in Washington for the annual Arts Advocacy Day sponsored by Americans for the Arts, a national organization devoted to supporting nonprofit arts. The annual event has taken on heightened importance this year, after President Trump released a budget proposal that calls for the elimination of four cultural agencies with budgets totaling more than $970 million. \n[Trump wants to cut the NEA and NEH. This is the worst-case scenario for arts groups] \nOn Tuesday, following a pep rally breakfast featuring artists Ben Vereen, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Gabrielle Ruiz, some 700 advocates will visit lawmakers to make the case for supporting these agencies. \nWalker offered inspiration and motivation in advance of the Capitol Hill visits, outlining reasons to support government funding and rebutting the rhetoric of those who want to see it eliminated. To those who say government should focus on basic needs for the hungry and homeless, he said that of course those needs must be met. “But all people also yearn for beauty and they also long for grace,” he said. \n“And the notion that low-income and working-class people do not derive meaning from the arts? That notion is insulting and ignorant,” he said in a veiled response to comments by White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney . \nWalker addressed the economic argument for investing in the arts — citing the cultural sector’s 4.8 million jobs and its $700 billion in economic activity — but he admitted it pains him to make the case purely in economic terms. \n“I know numbers matter, but the numbers are not why we support the arts. Conventional metrics will always fall short. Numbers will never explain what happens when the curtain goes up. They don’t capture the change of heart, the questions that are sparked,” he said. \nHe noted that those who support the budget plan “see themselves as cutting waste,” but he argued that the expense is a minuscule piece of total spending and the return on the investment proves its value. \nHe shot down the suggestion that private donations, foundation grants and crowdsourcing campaigns can replace the endowments, saying that those sources would support big institutions, urban centers and Internet-friendly projects. “We can’t Kickstarter our way out of this,” he said to laughter. “Government investment has a broader, more deep and more profound impact.” \nWalker was most eloquent when connecting the arts to the American ideals of equality and democracy. He cited arts groups and programs that “make America great” and encouraged his audience to defend the government’s critical role in keeping these programs afloat. \n“The arts have the power to lead us forward, to heal us, to bridge real divides,” he said. “Let us resolve to make our voices heard. Let us resolve not to despair, for this battle is for the very soul of America.” lifestyle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:11:00.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
