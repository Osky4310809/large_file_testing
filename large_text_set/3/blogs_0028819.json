As at close of business on Tuesday 21 March, these are available for 42 of the 59 lower house electorates. I will update this post as further counts are completed.) \nThe preference data in this analysis is taken from the WAEC's   in each seat. The data differs from more accurate preference flow data collected by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). \nPreference flow data is tallied from ballot papers and identifies totals by pairing first preference vote to a final destination preference. Preference flow data in an electorate determines a total of votes for each excluded candidate that reached one of the final two candidates after preferences. \nRecording preference flow data adds a significant extra cost to the count, which is why none of the state electoral commissions have followed the AEC's lead in capturing the data. \nUtilising preference distribution data limits analysis to candidates who were the last excluded in each seat. It is not possible with final exclusion data to distinguish between preference flows of the candidate's first preferences and those of candidates excluded at earlier stages of the count. \nFor example, if you look at the WAEC's results for Vasse , the first candidate excluded from the four candidate contest was the Green candidate Luke O'Connell, leaving three candidates in the race. O'Connell's preferences split 654 (19.8%) to Liberal Libby Mettam, 894 (27.1%) to National Peter Gordon, and 1,746 (53.0%) to Labor's Wes Hartley. Three ballot papers exhausted at this point under Western Australia's liberal formality rules. \nThe second and final candidate excluded was National Peter Gordon. His 5,500 votes distributed 3,743 (68.1%) to Liberal Mettam and 1,757 (31.9%) to Labor's Hartley. As this data is   preferences, it is not possible to distinguish between the preferences of the 4,606 National first preference ballot papers and the 894 Green first preference ballot papers transferred to the Nationals at the previous count. \nHowever, accepting this limitation in the data, it is possible to tabulate preferences for electorates where Green or One Nation candidates were the final excluded. \nTo do this I will concentrate on the 43 Perth electorates and exclude 16 non-metropolitan seats. I concentrate on the metropolitan seats for two reasons. First, almost all of the key seats that decided the election were in metropolitan Perth. Second, non-Metropolitan preference distributions are complicated by the National Party contesting every seat meaning that National or Liberal Liberal candidates were the last excluded in most non-metropolitan seats. \nBefore moving to the preference distributions, it is worth looking at the change in first preference vote in metropolitan seats classified by whether an electorate was contested by One Nation. \nThe table below provides this summary data. Note that the Contested by One Nation seats include Kalamunda (7.2% first preference), Scarborough (4.0%) and Thornlie (7.7%) where the listed One Nation candidate either resigned or was disendorsed before polling day. Metropolitan Perth Seats - Percantage Vote and Change in Percentage Vote Contested by One Nation (20) No One Nation Candidate (23) Party 43.0 -13.4 \nThe important figures are the columns labelled 'Change', and we are trying to explain differences between the change columns based on whether there was a One nation candidate or not. \nThe table says that in aggregate terms the Liberal first preference vote was 3.7 percentage points lower in seats where there was a One Nation candidate. This is calculated from the difference between the change columns, and the same figures for Labor are 1.0% lower, Greens 1.1% lower and Others 1.8% lower. \nThis very rough analysis suggests that half of One Nation's support in Perth came from the Liberal Party, and the remaining half from other parties. \nThe argument for the Liberal Party's preference deal with One Nation was that One Nation how-to-votes would strengthen preference flows to the Liberal Party. If One Nation how-to-votes were changing the intended preference destination of voters, you would expect to see a significant difference in two-party preferred swing depending on whether there was a One Nation candidate or not. \nThat there is little difference suggests that in seats where voters gave first preferences to One Nation, the split on further preference to Labor or Liberal was about the same as the split created on first or further preference when the contest did not include a One Nation candidate. \n(A more accurate method of assessing this would be doing regression analysis on the changes in individual seats, but that analysis will have to await publication of final figures.) \nThere have been preference distributions released for eight electorate where One Nation finished third. So far the preferences are in total flowing 56.1% to the Liberal Party. The individual results are Butler (8.9% first preferences, 55.4% flow to Liberal), Darling Range (8.7%, 60.8%), Forrestfield (10.0%, 57.0%), Kwinana (9.4%, 56.4%), Mandurah (12.9%, 56.4%), Swan Hills (11.0%, 53.0%), Thornlie (7.7%, 53.8%, candidate disendorsed) and Wanneroo (9.8%, 56.1%). \nThe fact that One Nation preference flows to the Liberal Party are relatively weak where One Nation's primary vote is high backs up my comments on the table above that One Nation can't be seen to be doing much more than sending back to the Liberal Party the share of first preference votes it lost in the seat by One Nation standing a candidate. \nThe question is what would the preference flows have been had One Nation not directed preferences to the Liberal Party? When One Nation contested the 2001 WA election, it recommended preferences against sitting members. Using the equivalent final exclusion data for 2001, preferences flowed against sitting members in 18 of the 24 seats available, and 54.9% to Labor in the 11 electorates with sitting Liberal MPs. \nComparing 2001 to 2017, it would be fair to say that the Liberal Party's preference arrangement with One Nation prevented what could have been a worse swing against the government in its own seats. Against this, of the 17 seats gained by Labor in Perth, ten did not have a One Nation candidate, including many in the 7-15% range so critical to the result of the election. \nWhatever the impact of the preference arrangement on results, it was clear that preference deals dogged attempts by Premier Barnett to discuss other issues in the campaign. Whether he was announcing initiatives in educations, transport or health care, he always ended up being required to fend off question on preference deals or the latest utterances of a previously unheard of One Nation candidate. \nThe fact that the Liberal Party had entered a preference 'deal' with One Nation ended up being the news that dominated the campaign. The deal may have done more damage to the government's first preference vote than it delivered back to the government in preferences. \nAll the fuss about One Nation may have benefited Labor by increasing the flow of Green preferences. \nIn the 25   Greens were the last excluded candidate,   80.1% to Labor and 19.9% to the Liberal Party. \nThat is well up on the same figure at previous elections, 69.4% from 37 contests in 2013, 68.5% from 41 in 2008 and 68.1% from 17 contests in 2001. It is even higher than the 74.9% flow calculated from actual preference flow data in 2005. \nIn every electorate where direct comparison is available, Green preference distributions to Labor rose compared to 2013. Even in Fremantle where the flow rose from 79% to 2013 to 90% in 2017. \nFor all the talk of preferences, there are only four of the 59   candidate leading on first preferences did not win the contest. Four of those seats were seats Labor took from the Liberal Party, Green preferences delivering victory in Bicton, Joondalup, Kalamunda and Kingsley. \n(With the assistance of the WAEC and WA Parliament, I hope in future months to be able to repeat an exercise I undertook in 2005 in using administrative documents to accumulate approximate preference flow data.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:47:52.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
