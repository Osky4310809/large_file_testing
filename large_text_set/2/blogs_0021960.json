One brave mom gave it a try, and the result is fantastic.\nRachel Sklar, feminist media figure and founder of The Li.st , appeared a few weeks back as a guest on CBC news to talk about Barbie's recent makeover . At first glance, you’d think she was just like any other talking head. Until the end..when out of nowhere, a baby hand reaches up to grab her shoulder.\nI went on TV while nursing and you couldn't tell (until the end) https://t.co/fhqKQvVBcX cc @CBCNews pic.twitter.com/4AVqHtrJK5\n— ((( Rachel Sklar ))) (@rachelsklar) February 24, 2017\nNo, it’s not a scene from a horror movie. Turns out she’d been nursing her young daughter the whole time — the baby had been just out of frame until she decided to put in a hilarious little cameo.\nSo perfect. Sure, you always suspect those newscasters are wearing pajama bottoms under the desk, but you probably never considered those talking heads might also be feeding their offspring while delivering solid takes. But why shouldn't they be? When a kid’s gotta eat, they gotta eat, and they don’t really care that mom’s got to hop on TV.\nKudos to Sklar for being an inspiration to working moms everywhere and for raising a kid with excellent comedic timing.\nBONUS: This quiet and discrete breast pump could be a game changer for many moms.", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/wWJr91eR.jpg", "https://twitter.com/CBCNews", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/wWJr91eR.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/rachelsklar/status/835179290081779716", "https://twitter.com/TheList", "https://t.co/fhqKQvVBcX", "https://t.co/4AVqHtrJK5"], "published": "2017-02-25T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T17:50:16.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
