He’s averaged a whopping 6 minutes in his 16 Premier League appearances, which is surely approaching some sort of record. 5) Unimpressed Chelsea boss Conte ready to move on from £33m Batshuayi after just one year #CFC https://t.co/rHgSO5skzl pic.twitter.com/7nHgpNKpOA — Mirror Football (@MirrorFootball) February 28, 2017 The Mirror does not venture a guess as to who might be willing to take on Batshuayi’s transfer fee and salary — not so easy to get rid of a £33m-man on good wages after all — nor does it acknowledge the fact that above all, Batshuayi was bought as a player for the future rather than the present. With Diego Costa outperforming expectations, both in terms of goals and healthy minutes, it’s not entirely surprising that Batshuayi’s been reduced to a strictly backup (and sometimes not even that) role. That said, with Chelsea constantly linked with other strikers — Lukaku, Morata, Celtic’s Dembélé the usual suspects, through there’s a recent report about Bayern target Andrea Belotti against as well — Batshuayi’s future is far from certain. But his attitude seems good and Conte seems committed to working with him, so I’d like to think this first season is just one long preamble to a successful career at Chelsea. On a slightly related note, the Chinese transfer window has now closed. And Diego Costa is still here! Imagine that.
