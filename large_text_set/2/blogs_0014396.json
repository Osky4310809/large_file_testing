I remember about a million people rising up about Iraq and he ignored it — RB (@piefan) February 17, 2017 His words made some think voting Leave was the correct thing to do Every time I see or hear Tony Blair & his pro-Remain “movement” just convinces me all the more that voting Leave was the right thing to do — A Libertarian Rebel (@A_Liberty_Rebel) February 17, 2017 When Tony Blair is so desperate for us to stay in the EU, you know you did the right thing voting for Brexit. — Candygram for Mongo (@Phoenixarised) February 17, 2017 Tony Blair wants to campaign against Brexit, what more proof do people need, that we Brexiteers are right? — junius (@AkesterGeorge) February 17, 2017 Some seemed to think he was a hypocrite Tony Blair saying we don't know what Brexiters voted for !!! wow did his supporters vote for a war he started after he was elected — Coll Dickinson-Jones (@roebuckslaw2) February 17, 2017 'We don't trust you' Cannot understand why Tony Blair just cant stay away. Its simple Tony we dont trust you. Go away. — Abdul (@DayTradeFtse100) February 17, 2017 Even Remainers weren't fans of his speech Tomorrow, Tony Blair is going to ask us to 'rise up' against Brexit & overturn the result. I voted Remain, this fool doesn't speak for me. — Rachael (@Rachael_Swindon) February 17, 2017 Some thought he should have helped attitudes towards the EU when he was Prime Minister Blair as a leading anti-Brexit voice. If only he'd ever held a senior government position where he could have reframed perceptions of the EU — J Clive-Matthews (@nosemonkey) February 17, 2017 Others think he may have ulterior motives I accept #Brexit will cause damage . It will damage Tony Blair's chances of being President of Europe — Robert Winfield (@RobertWinfield2) February 17, 2017 However, a few did stand up for him Tony Blair wants to campaign against Brexit, what more proof do people need, that we Brexiteers are right?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:47:05.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
