He also agreed to give states the option to block grant Medicaid, as opposed to the bill’s original cap system. \n“The block grant is very important because I want the states to get the money and to run the program, if they want to run it,” Trump said. \nStates “can do it better than the federal government. They are better equipped than the federal government,” he continued. \nTrump was successful in winning the favor of some conservatives on Friday, but others are still pushing back. \nRep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., rejected the president’s claim that conservatives were warming up to the GOP health care bill. “It remains a disaster,” Amash tweeted Friday. Absolutely not true that conservatives have flipped to yes on the health care bill. It doesn't repeal Obamacare. It remains a disaster. \n— Justin Amash (@justinamash) March 17, 2017 \nSens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have also stated on the record that they would reject the current version of the bill if it were to reach the Senate. What do you think?
