Trent Franks, one of the Freedom Caucus members, told CNN that he'll be at the bowling outing to hear the White House's pitch, even if Trump only makes an appearance and doesn't knock down any pins himself. \nOffice of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney will be the main draw. Pizza will reportedly be served. \n“Invitations to the White House are not terribly uncommon, but if it gives us an opportunity to hear some reasonable input, then I'm excited to hear it,” Franks said. \n“I think communication is a good thing, it doesn't even have to be charming, you know, if that's not conducive to effective communication.” \nTrump seemed confident he’d be able to make the deal happen. \n“Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture,” he tweeted Thursday. Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2017 \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was equally optimistic of the bill’s success, telling reporters, “this bill will land on the president's desk. He will sign it. We will repeal Obamacare.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:09:21.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
