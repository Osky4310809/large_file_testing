Well, now with this zigzag styling iron , you can give your hair a whole new look for 2017 . And when we say “new look,” we mean totally retro look , since it channels the crimped hair of the 1980s and 1990s with the wavy look of the 2000s.\nThe Glampalm Zigzag Styling Iron is the tool that you need to get this funky look. The iron costs $220 and Glampalm claims it will give you “uniform, texturized waves.” The result is less tight than traditional hair crimping , with each angle being more set apart for a truly unique and geometric look.\nEmbrace a look that's bold and unique with Glampalm's Zigzag Styling Iron.

Canadian-based hair artist Ariba Pervaiz posted a tutorial on her Instagram to help you achieve this look.\nWh t is this?! How fun is this Zig-Zag curling iron from @glampalmusa ?! I've never used anything like it. I was afraid my hair would get too frizzy if the curls opened up but it created such a unique texture! The trick is to twist the roots before wrapping the hair around the iron and to unravle the section the same way you wrap it.
