Seconds later, a crocodile latched onto him.\n“It all happened very fast. Pretty much as soon as he jumped in, there was splashing and screaming,” Paterson told Queensland’s Courier-Mail newspaper. “There was blood everywhere and he just wouldn’t stop screaming.”\nDe Paauw managed to pull himself out of the water. Queensland paramedic Neil Noble said the teen suffered extensive injuries to his arm, and was lucky to escape from the crocodile before the animal drowned him.\nMeanwhile, Queensland authorities on Monday recovered a body believed to be that of a man who vanished on Saturday while spearfishing alone in waters just north of Innisfail. The 35-year-old man’s boat was found anchored off Palmer Point, about 50 kilometres north of Innisfail, on Saturday evening, with his spear gun floating in the water nearby.\nThere was blood everywhere and he just wouldn’t stop screaming\nAn air and sea search was launched and officials spotted a body in the water on Monday morning, Queensland police said in a statement. An initial investigation suggests the man may have been taken by a crocodile, police said.\nWildlife officers were hunting for the animal, believed to be around 4 metres long.\nCrocodiles have been a protected species in Australia since the 1970s, which has led to an explosion in their population across the country’s tropical north. Because saltwater crocodiles can live up 70 years and grow throughout their lives — reaching up to 7 metres (23 feet) in length — the proportion of large crocodiles is also rising.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:23:47.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
