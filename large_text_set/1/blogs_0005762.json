In a statement Tuesday, March 16, 2010, Woods said he will play at Augusta National after a four-month hiatus because of a sex scandal. The Masters begins on April 8. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) ORG XMIT: NY154 (Photo: AP) \nThe hype surrounding Tiger Woods' latest comeback has been pretty fun for everyone to jump in on, but what's happening in Las Vegas seems a little much. \nFrom Golfweek : \nIn particular, at Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, where Woods's odds dropped from 40/1 to 20/1 following his 15th-place finish in the 18-man Hero World Challenge, 8 percent of Masters betting tickets are on him, with 11 percent of Masters money wagered going toward Woods bets. \nThe biggest wager on Woods thus far, according to Forbes, is a $1,000 ticket posted when Woods's Masters odds were 50/1. \nMaybe some of these bets are coming in so that Woods fans can have both an emotional and monetary attachment to rooting him on at Augusta later this year. But this is betting on a guy who just played in his first tournament in over a year, who just turned 42, and whose last finish at the 2015 Masters was tied for 17th. \nSoooo, yeah. Throwing a few bucks on a \"you never know, it's Tiger\" bet at 40/1 seems like good value. But pushing him to 20/1 before he's played a single PGA Tour round in 2017? I'm not buying yet.
