The UK company will be investing $561 million as part of its commitment to the new facility, which hosts working labs where research and development teams can pool their cumulative hardware and software know-how to help advance the company’s growing ambitions. \nIf you’re only passingly familiar with Dyson’s work, you might be wondering what a company that makes vacuums needs with a half-million dollar tech facility with a focus the company says is on “artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development. But Dyson has always emphasized its tech edge in the domestic cleaning hardware market, and it’s only doing more to push that advantage lately, including more work in robotics, computer visions systems and machine learning with products like its Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum. \nAs you can see from the photos of the facility, the company also put a lot of engineering work into one of its most recent products, the Supersonic hair dryer. There has also been some speculation that Dyson could extend some of its expertise around electric motors and battery tech into the automotive space, though the company isn’t saying much one way or another about those reports just yet. dyson-stc-reception-day-01", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:23:53.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
