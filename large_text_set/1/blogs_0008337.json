WVU's 89-68 home win marked the third straight Mountaineers victory over Baylor by double digits. \nWant some more context on the game and these teams? You got it. Let's dig in; here are five takeaways from a dominating performance by Bob Huggins' 14-2, nightmare-inducing squad. \n1. Baylor is not fraudulent \nThe unoriginal and drive-by skeptics will look at the \"1\" next to Baylor's name, see a 21-point margin of defeat, remember Scott Drew coaches the Bears and then will come to hilariously shallow conclusion that BU isn't legit. \nIt is. \nThis isn't the best team in the country, and probably isn't one of the five best teams in the country, but the Bears are good enough to be considered top-10. The Bears didn't build a 15-0 start on cupcakes and NAIA schools. They defeated Oregon and Michigan State and Louisville and Xavier and Iowa State before falling on their faces on Tuesday night. \nA loss was inevitable. Baylor was a six-point underdog, after all. Losing the way they did was mildly alarming, but remember, West Virginia's defense strangles you. Baylor was choked to death on Tuesday night. Johnathan Motley and Baylor were unable to figure out WVU. USATSI \n2. West Virginia's suffocating defense played its best game of the season \nBaylor's 29 turnovers were the most in a game for the program in nearly 20 years. That's a testament to how Huggins had Drew's team figured out, sure, but also speaks to how damn good WVU is. Baylor's previous season-high for turnovers in a game was 16; WVU nearly doubled that. \nGiven the competition, this was the most impressive defensive effort of the season for WVU.The Mountaineers have had games where they've forced more than 30, even more than 40 turnovers. But none of those teams are as good as Baylor. The Bears had 15 turnovers in the first 13 minutes -- and still weren't out of it. \nThe separation came in the second half, when WVU hit BU with a 24-7 run and created enough distance to put this game to bed with 10 minutes to go. \n3. This is the fourth win in WVU's history over a top-ranked team \nThe Mountaineers are now 4-8 in their history, and 3-4 at home, when playing the No. 1 team. I wouldn't say this is \"historic,\" but I will say that West Virginia will now rightfully enter into the conversation for a legitimate Final Four team. Truth us, this team's been a computer darling for the past month, so the talking heads might just be catching up to what the metrics indicated back in December. \n4. Baylor's not out of the woods \nBaylor's got an easier opponent but not necessarily a surefire win coming up next. The Bears have another road game, this one at Kansas State, which is 13-2 and ranks as a top-30 team at KenPom. So here's the skinny: Baylor's going to probably need to win that game in order to keep ground in the Big 12 race. Kansas is the league favorite and has famously won the conference title 12 years in a row, but if it's going to get any sort of push from Drew's club, it's going to have to come in the form of road wins. \nBaylor can keep its reputation in good standing with a bounce-back performance at K-State on Saturday. A win would go a long way, even if it seems like just an OK game from the outside. \n5. Gonzaga the last unbeaten left \nThe Bulldogs were ranked 14th in the preseason. They're 16-0 and almost surely going to get to 16-0 because the next game comes at home on Thursday night vs. Loyola Marymount. After that? Ah, enticing! Saint Mary's-Gonzaga goes down on Saturday. The Gaels are ranked 21st in the country and should be in the NCAA Tournament this year. That sets up as a top-five game this weekend. Gonzaga has never been the final unbeaten team in a season in the history of college basketball.
