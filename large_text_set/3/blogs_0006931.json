Considering the show’s focus on the newer generation of Sugar Hill Records, it was obvious Melle Mel would have some shine on the show due to his role on the label’s legendary single “The Message” from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. \nDuring the series’ fifth episode, Melle Mel said Jay Z and Eminem’s music was “garbage” following a conversation about why he doesn’t like rappers of today. \n“These are just guys posing. Jay, all of them,” Mel said as people in the room pause. “He’s a white guy. Jay Z’s a white guy. Jay Z’s a white businessman. He’s a clown.” \nWhen asked about Eminem, Mel once again brought race into the equation. \n“What about him?” he asked. “He’s white. What if I was white? I can beat Eminem.” \nThese words are especially potent considering Hov will be the first rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame , has an upcoming album and just announced a venture capital fund .
