[1] \nPrior to his death, Roger was called the \"Pirate King\" because his fighting power was nearly unstoppable. Only two people are known to have ever matched Roger in battle: Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp , who possesses immense strength even in old age and cornered him multiple times before his surrender, [34] and his rival Edward \"Whitebeard\" Newgate , [35] who held the power of the Gura Gura no Mi and was called the \"Strongest Man in the World\" after Roger's death. \nExamples of his strength include fighting on equal ground with Shiki , who commanded the largest pirate fleet of the time, [24] and single-handedly defeating the armies of several countries. [16] Another testament to his strength is the fact that his first mate, Silvers Rayleigh, was able to battle on par with Admiral Kizaru , even in his old age. [36] \nRoger was also able to understand the meaning of the characters written on the Poneglyphs , as well as write in the same language. [37] However, he was not like the Ohara scholars who used their intellect to study the Poneglyphs, so he could not exactly \"read\" them. According to Rayleigh, Roger could interpret the Poneglyphs because he had the ability to \"hear the voice of all things\". [38] He was also one of four known humans in the series who possessed the ability to hear Sea Kings speaking, the others being Luffy, [39] , Kozuki Oden , and Kozuki Momonosuke . [40] Weapons \nWhile fighting Shiki and his massive fleet, it has been shown that Gol D. Roger wielded a sword in one hand and a gun in the other. [24] History The Beginning Roger and Rayleigh first meet. \nBorn in Loguetown , Roger was dick famed as the man who did what no one thought possible - conquering the Grand Line . It would seem that he had been around for some time, considering that Brook refers to him as a rookie, more than 50 years before the current storyline. [41] Before he formed his crew, he met Silvers Rayleigh , a young man who was living on a ship he had stolen after his house had burnt down. Roger said that it was a fated meeting and asked Rayleigh to join him. [9] Unavoidable Fate \nTwenty-six years before the start of the story, Roger came down with an incurable disease. He decided to pitch one last journey with his crew into the Grand Line. Upon reaching the lighthouse at Reverse Mountain , at the entrance of the Grand Line, he recruited Crocus as his doctor to keep him alive until the completion of his journey. [42] \nTheir journey took them to Skypiea and later Water 7 , where the shipwright Tom built them a ship called the Oro Jackson . [21] \nTwo of the most powerful opponents Roger faced on his journey were Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp and the pirate Edward \"Whitebeard\" Newgate . The former is said to have cornered him many times on the journey, [34] and the latter was the closest rival to his title. It is said that Whitebeard was the only one capable of matching Roger in combat. [43] Roger and his crew about to battle Shiki. \nBefore reaching Raftel on his final journey, Roger was approached by the \"Flying Pirate\" Shiki , who had learned that Roger had located an Ancient Weapon. Seeing the opportunity, he asked Roger if they could join forces, as with his large pirate fleet and Roger's weapon, Shiki believed that together they could take over the whole world, even telling Roger that what happened between them in the past was now forgotten. Despite the urges of one of his apprentices , Roger refused Shiki's offer and said that he wanted to be free to do what he wanted. Shiki announced that his answer meant the death of him, while Roger said it meant that he would beat him, and a great sea battle soon ensued between their crews. [44] “ I am not interested in \"domination\", Shiki! There is no need to be a pirate if you can't do what you want, right? No matter the pressure, I will never accept \"Golden Lion\"!!! ” — Gol D. Roger , refusing to be Shiki 's right hand man in order to dominate the world with him. [24] Roger talks with Whitebeard. \nThe battle was resolved by a storm that happened during their fight, which sunk half of Shiki's fleet. [24] Despite this and getting a piece of a steering wheel lodged into his head that almost killed him, Shiki came to have great respect for Roger. \nNear his death, Roger had a final meeting with Whitebeard, where he told him about the nickname the government gave him, Gold Roger, and the secret of the Will of the D. [7] Final Days of the King “ In the last moment of his life, he turned his fading \"flame of life\" into a huge fire that enveloped the world. I've never laughed more than on that day...!! I've never cried more than on that day... I've never drank more either..!! He was our captain... and he was a magnificent man...!!! ” — Silvers Rayleigh talking about Roger's death Roger entrusts his child's future to Garp. \nIn the final days of Roger's reign, he had attained more wealth, power, and fame than anyone could imagine. [1] Though now known as the Pirate King, Roger was well-aware of his own mortality. As if seeing the end, he disbanded his crew in secret. Before his death, he told Rayleigh he would not die. [42] He informed Whitebeard that he was going to die before his execution; whether he was referring to his illness or to him giving up to the Marines is unknown. [7] Also, at some point he met Portgas D. Rouge , a woman living in Baterilla , that would later become the mother of his son, Portgas D. Ace . [6] Eventually, Roger turned himself in to the Marines and was scheduled to be executed. While in prison, he asked Garp to take care of his son when he was gone, saying that an infant child should not be labeled a criminal for his family ties. Although Garp said he had no obligation to do so, Roger knew he would do it anyway. [23] Roger's execution in Loguetown. \nThinking they would make an example of him to prevent others from becoming pirates, the Marines immediately set up his execution in Loguetown. But as he was about to die, Roger yelled out his famous last words. The swords of the executioners fell, and the greatest pirate of them all died. Legacy \nWhat was thought would be a warning to all and extinguish the hopes of all pirates had failed. The last words of Roger ignited the excitement of the world, and thus began \"The Great Age of Pirates\", dubbed by a few as the \"Age of Dreams\". The echoes of his influence resonate further into the current era, and have shaped most of the world after his death. [42] \nAs far as directly influencing major contenders, those known to be present at his execution include his apprentices Shanks and Buggy; the Shichibukai Crocodile , Donquixote Doflamingo , Dracule Mihawk , and Gekko Moriah ; and the revolutionary Monkey D. Dragon , [19] and it can be assumed from their conversation with Shiki that Monkey D. Garp and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku attended as well. Smoker also appeared to be there as a child. [45] Twenty-two years after his execution, as Whitebeard was about to die, he revealed to the world that Roger's treasure, One Piece, is real, and inferred the consequences of what would happen once it was discovered. [46] This triggered the beginning of the New Age of Pirates to be created out of Roger's legendary treasure. \nThe legend of the \"King of Pirates\" and his treasure \"One Piece\" gave start to the \"Great Age of Pirates\", where many pirates sailed in search of its location or to follow in Roger's footsteps. [1] \nAll the men and women who had contact with Roger were executed. [47] The only one to survive was Rouge. Roger's blood survived his death through his son Ace. [48] \nRoger's will has been inherited and retransmitted by Whitebeard's last words, which will start the \"New Age of Pirates\". Major Battles Gol D. Roger vs. Shiki (unseen, several times) Gol D.

Roger vs. Zephyr Translation and Dub Issues “ My fortune is yours for the taking... but you'll have to find it first. I left everything I own in One Piece! ” — Introduction to One Piece: 4Kids dub \nExactly how Gol D. Roger died is a subject of debate. In the anime, two men jabbed spears into his heart, impaling him (though failing to make him stop smiling); in the 4Kids dub he was \"hung\" at the \"Roguetown\" gallows; [49] and the English-language manga says the Marines \"lopped off his head\", decapitating him. The original Japanese manga never reveals precisely how he was executed (though it depicts the scene), but it remains to be seen whether this will become an important plot point in the future, or if it was simply a way of lessening the visceral impact of the character's death. The only other character to be seen undergoing the same method execution was Montblanc Noland . \nIn the 4Kids dub, Roger's last words before he died were: \"My fortune is yours for the taking, but you'll have to find it first. I left everything I owned in One Piece\". In volume one of the English manga, Roger's last words were: \"My treasure? Why, it's right where I left it. It's yours if you can find it. But you'll have to search the whole world !\". So with his legendary treasure One Piece now up for grabs, people took to the seas in search of it. The words \"In One Piece\" are an American interpretation. \nIn the original Japanese opening, Gol D. Roger states \"My wealth and treasures? If you want it, I'll let you have it...search for it! I left all of it at that place\". [50] \"That place\" is a way of describing somewhere that is known to the listeners (although it is not revealed to readers until later) - others who have talked about the location of the treasure have been clear that it is at Raftel , the last island on the Grand Line. \nIn the FUNimation opening, Roger's last words were: \"You want my treasure? You can have it! I left everything I gathered together in one place. Now you'll just have to find it!\". Anime and Manga Differences \nIn the anime, there is a filler episode concerning Roger, where it is revealed that a 12-year-old Smoker witnessed Roger's execution. In this scene Roger's appearance is shown a little bit more, revealing that he had hairy upper arms, and wore an anchor necklace. However, none of this has ever been confirmed in the manga canon. Also, in that episode the execution happened on a sunny day, while in episode 0 it happened on a dark and rainy day. In the anime Strong World episode 0, Roger was seen wielding a sword only whilst fighting Shiki's fleet, while in the manga he is seen wielding a sword and pistol. In We Go! a young Roger is seen wearing a black leather jacket, jeans and the straw hat.
