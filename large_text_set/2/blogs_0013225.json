Director Clancy was singled out for praise by Pres Trump at a WH event 2 days after the Inauguration. pic.twitter.com/u9gmadK1g3 \n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) February 14, 2017 Advertisement - story continues below Limbaugh: White House Leaks Are A Bigger Problem Than Flynn’s Phone Call \nClancy, 70, joined the Secret Service in 1984. He was the head of Obama’s detail from 2009 to 2011 before retiring to join the private sector. \nHouse Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz praised Clancy for helping to repair “an agency plagued with mismanagement, misconduct and security lapses.” \n“Moving forward, I encourage President Trump to appoint a director from outside the agency. A fresh set of eyes and new perspective is needed to restore the prestige and status expected of such an elite agency,” Chaffetz said.

They all run on tight schedules,” adding that, “They’re all involved in athletics. Some enjoy golf, some enjoy running, some biking.” \nAs for himself, “Everything keeps me up night,” he said in January, adding, “that’s our business.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:25:53.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
