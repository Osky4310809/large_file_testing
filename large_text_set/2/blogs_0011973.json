There were major speculations that the two were dating, and we were hoping to see the two come together in a movie soon. While that didn't happen, (Amy was offered Kick , but she was busy with her South projects) we are glad to see the two come together for a Being Human campaign. So happy to be a part of the new @bebeinghuman campaign @BeingSalmanKhan ðŸ“¸ pic.twitter.com/XwDzD93J1l â€” Amy Jackson (@iamAmyJackson) February 16, 2017 \nWe are loving their chemistry. Hopefully, the positive response to this campaign will lead to some movie collaborations in 2017 (we are keeping our fingers crossed).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T10:48:23.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
