Ahmad Ahmad, New CAF Prresident \nThe 57-year-old former AC Sotema FC Coach, was later received officially by the members of the MFF and Muslim community at the Carlton hotel in Antananarivo, where he addressed the gathering. \nAhmad was last Thursday overwhelmingly voted as president of CAF, garnering 34 to 20 votes, to bring to a humiliating halt Issa Hayatou’s 29-year rule. \nHayatou was seeking a record eight straight terms in office. The Cameroonian was first elected to head the largest member of FIFA, the world’s football governing body, in March 1988. \nAhmad, a two-time government minister, is also expected to vacate his position as the MFF president, as required by the CAF rules. \nThis could happen anytime soon with MFF’s first vice-president Soda Andriamiasasoa expected to take over the reins on an interim basis pending elections.
