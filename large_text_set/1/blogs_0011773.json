There has been lots of talk. And there has been a lot of excitement. But now, finally, it looks like we might actually be getting genuinely close to seeing a fifth season of Arrested Development . \nThanks to a statement from Brian Grazer, the show’s executive producer, there’s new hope. While speaking with Deadline at the Television Critics Association, Grazer addressed the ongoing talk about the hilarious show’s highly anticipated return. At first, he just said the words we’ve all wanted to hear, but have heard many times before .\n“We are close,” he said. We’ve been waiting with bated breath for the return of the Bluth family for a long time, so hearing this was not too shocking. \nOnly this time, Grazer continued with some concrete evidence that this may actually be happening soon.\nHe added, “I think we found a way to create the compensation structure for all the actors and create a work matrix so they can still make movies and do other things and it will all integrate. So we are really close — I think within a couple of weeks at the most.” A couple of weeks?!? Please, let this be true!\n\nOf course, one of the biggest issues with making another season of Arrested Development happen is the craziness of each actor’s schedule. Pretty much every person on the show is a major comedic actor. They are all in-demand in various other projects. And they don’t easily have the time to set aside to create more wacky Bluth family antics.\nAfter all, the talent of the actors and chemistry that they have together is part of the reason we love the show so much. But the fact that a man so invested in the show is promising that they’ve found a way to work around the biggest challenge in creating a new season is making us actually believe it could actually happen this time.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T21:18:25.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
