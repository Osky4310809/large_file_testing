Images courtesy beinArt gallery The many group exhibitions hosted at beinArt gallery are known for bringing together a particularly varied and materially diverse artworks . Flesh & Bone exhibition, their latest collection of ink drawings, wire sculptures, and watercolor paintings, is a testament to that reputation. The show features a macabre display of works that celebrate the biology of life and death. Jonathan Guthmann’s etchings on Hahnemühle paper feature neo-Gothic, almost folkloric illustrations of a human skeleton that’s been explicitly identified as ‘death.’ Erik Thor Sandberg includes a similar skeletal figure in one of his Italian Renaissance themed oil paintings. Gerard Geer, Rapture, assorted animal bones, garnet & smokey quartz crystals, wire, acacia wood base and glass dome, 14 x 27cm (5.5”x10.6”) Kit King, Eat A Dick, oil on gallery panel, 20.3 x 25.4cm (8”x10\") But the works in Flesh & Bone aren't exclusive to the homo sapien, either. Sam Yong’s The Tell-Tale Heart shows a vivid and crisply painted crow nibbling out the inside of a dead rabbit. From a combination of animal bones, garnet and smokey quartz crystals, artist Gerard Gree r creates skeletal sculptures of infernal creatures that look like they’re straight out of Guillermo del Toro films. Greer’s work bears visual similarities to Jake Hempson 's 3D-printed sculptures of bones taken from the supernatural and grotesque. Perhaps one of the more transgressive works in the show is Kit King 's oil painting of a skewered hot dog that’s been carved to look like a penis. Jonathan Payne 's fleshlette sculptures are bizarre surrealist characters put together from deformed body parts made out of polymer clay, acrylics, and human hair.
