The company has rolled out a server-side update to that app that puts in a new high-level notification for Doodles.\nSee also: Google Assistant: The top features you should know September 22, 2016 The update puts the Notifications option at the very top of the Settings menu for the Google app on most Android devices. If you own a Google Pixel or Pixel XL , that new Notifications option can be viewed under the Google Assistant menu.\nAt the moment, the new setting is only for “New Doodle games, videos, and interactive experiences” and is set to off by default, which means you have to go in and enable it if you really want to get the heads up on when a new Doodle goes live. It’s more than possible that the Google search app will add even more notification options to this new feature in the coming weeks and months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:04:02.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
