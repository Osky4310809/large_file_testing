I just hope to give it my best. It’s gonna be one of the biggest fights of the century, you know what I’m saying? [It’s going to be one of the] biggest fights of the year.” \n“It’s not about the money at all,” Soulja Boy continued. “It’s about me, my respect as a man. I was disrespected as a man. I was challenged to a fight [and] I accepted the challenge. It’s not about the money. I’ve been making millions of dollars since I was 17 years old. It’s not about the money at all. It’s about my respect. I’ma go into the fight and give it my all and I’ma knock his ass out.” \nWith regards to his training, Soulja Boy says that he’s been mostly focused on his breathing, later admitting that he’s had to lay off the weed as a result. \n“I smoke a lot so I had to put down the weed,” he says. \nSoulja Boy also rebuffed claims that the fight will now be taking place in Dubai due to rules and regulations preventing such a fight from taking place on U.S. soil. \n“I don’t know where that came from,” he adds. “We supposed to fight in [Las] Vegas or L.A., that’s what Floyd [Mayweather] said. Floyd Mayweather’s my trainer [and] he said Mayweather Promotions, we gonna do Las Vegas or we gonna do Los Angeles in March … I got two months to train … I just got off the phone with Floyd Mayweather, man, we doing it in [Las] Vegas in March.” \nAs expected, Soulja Boy’s confident of walking away with the win, saying: “I think I’m gonna win. I’m not saying it’s gonna be an easy win but I think that I’m gonna win for sure.” \nElsewhere in the interview, the reporter asked Soulja Boy if he had a message for his opponent, to which Soulja replied: “Ay, man, after the fight we can shake hands and be friends.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
