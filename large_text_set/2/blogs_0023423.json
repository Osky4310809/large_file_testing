Park officials said the prudish activists reported the video as sexually explicit in a bid to get it removed.\n“There’s a handful of extremists and animal rights activists that may not agree with us and that’s okay,” said zoo owner Jordan Patch in a Facebook video addressing the shutdown . “What this has done is pulled an educational tool away from tens of millions of individuals. We’re further harming the species of giraffes.”\n“This is a perfect example of why we cannot have nice things,” he added.\nPatch reiterated that the zoo is helping to conserve giraffes’ natural environment to ensure their survival.\n“Instead of sitting behind a keyboard or holding a protest sign, I encourage the animal rights activists, get behind conservation,” he said. “We’re all on the same team.”\nAt around 9 a.m. Thursday, the live stream went back up, showing a heavily-pregnant April pacing her indoor pen in anticipation of her baby.\nThe calf will weigh about 150 lbs. and will be about six feet tall at birth, the zoo said.\nThis will be the fourth calf for 15-year-old April and the first for her much younger mate, Oliver, who is five.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:42:49.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
