I’m going to give major credit to Chance and Kirsten for working together to reach a deal that’s fair for their daughter, fair for them both.” \nEarlier this month, The Chicago Sun-Times ran an editorial questioning Chance’s position as a role model with his child support case pending. The Windy City native lashed back and shared images of his small family, showing everything was fine. \nHe also announced a donation of $1 million to Chicago Public Schools , which was received with much praise .
