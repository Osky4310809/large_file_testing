It’s believed that they will be called the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus and they will both be equipped with incredibly thin bezels at both the top/bottom and sides of the phone. \nWe’re even seeing reports that they will have bigger screens than any previous Galaxy S device in the past, with the regular one being 5.7″ and the bigger version being 6.2″ . \nThe feature image above (which you can view in its entirety by tapping/clicking on it) has been provided to us by @DforDesign , and is currently being reported as the actual glass that will be covering the screen. These actually seem like tempered glass screen protectors, but either way they give us a look at what the upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphones could look like. This thin bezel design actually meshes with the confirmation we received about Samsung investing in edge-to-edge display technology . \nThese screens won’t go all the way up to the top and bottom edges, but they do show us what type of progress Samsung has been making lately. This image also coincides with the rumors about Samsung ditching their physical buttons for the S8 phones , and opting for virtual navigation buttons instead. They’re also really close to what GSM Arena published late last week when they revealed a render of what the upcoming phone could look like. \nSamsung hasn’t made major design changes like this since they debuted the Galaxy S6 back in 2015. As the company faces more intense competition from Apple this year (which marks the 10 year anniversary of the iPhone), and Google as well, it will be interesting to see if this new design pays off for Samsung. \nBased on the rumored specs, renders and this tempered glass protector, do you think the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will succeed with the average smartphone customers?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T17:46:53.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
