(PTI) \nThe Supreme Court has surprised everyone with the decision to treat the letter of the wife of the former Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh Kalikho Pul as a writ petition and to hear the matter before a bench of Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel and Justice UU Lalit tomorrow. \nIn the last few days, there have been hushed Chinese whispers among Supreme Court lawyers over the ‘suicide letter’ written by the first wife of former Chief Minister Kalikho Pul. He had committed suicide in August last year. \nNow it turns out that Pul had left a 60 page note – a suicide note – where he documented certain crucial details that are now being termed as ”serious allegations’.’ Not only did Pul write details in the note but he had meticulously signed every page! \nYou may also like to watch: \nThe letter reportedly reveals names of politicians and Judges in the context of serious corruption charges, particularly against two senior most judges of the apex court. \nA short excerpt from the letter written by Pul’s wife to the Chief Justice of India reads: \n“His suicide note contains many allegations of corruption in Arunachal Pradesh as well as in the judiciary and in particular against two seniormost judges of the Supreme Court, who were parties to the judgment which quashed President’s Rule and led to the unseating of my husband…. You are aware that a suicide note is like a dying declaration and is treated very seriously as evidence…” \nIn her letter to the Chief Justice of India, Dangwinsai – the first wife of Pul – put forth her demand for a CBI probe in strong words. She has also asked for a new FIR to be registered on the basis of the allegations of corruption stated in Pul’s suicide note. She believes that the state government did not probe her husband’s death properly. \nSupreme Court will hear the matter tomorrow.
