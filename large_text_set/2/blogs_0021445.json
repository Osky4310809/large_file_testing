Koeman wants to see his successor defeated on Sunday (Photo: Mike Hewitt / Getty) \nAs such, with the potential benefits that European football bring, in terms of being able to attract players, Koeman is hoping for a favour from United. \n\"It is true you need help from which team will win the EFL Cup or the FA Cup,” said Koeman. \n\"In that way we hope United will win at the weekend and one of biggest clubs wins the FA Cup, because then it's possible seventh in the table can play for qualification for the Europa League. \n\"Players like to be part of Europe, and like to be part of Champions League. That is the best for football players, but that will normally be impossible. Koeman with Everton fan Tony Bellew earlier this week \n\"The first step is to be part of Europe even if it being part of a difficult European league on Thursday or qualification really soon in the pre-season. We would like to do it and be part of it because Europe is the next step. \n\"Some players were interested, but ok, maybe also some like to see how we progressed in Everton for the future. You will always fight against big clubs with more reputation and with more Champions League competition. But I think we are in a good way to get what we want in the team and for next season.\" poll loading Who will win the EFL Cup final? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T14:50:22.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
