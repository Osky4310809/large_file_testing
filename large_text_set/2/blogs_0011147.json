White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) 28 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLetter to the editor: \nIt has become clear to me that this whole voter fraud insistence by President Trump is the new “wag the dog” to keep the nation’s attention from the real bite. Stephen Miller, policy aide to the president, commanded viewers to focus on voter fraud and his condescending tone almost dared anyone to not concentrate on this issue above other suspicious issues like Russian involvement with now ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and others in power in the current administration. As a country, we must be vigilant and act swiftly. Innocent until proven guilty seems naive in the face of harder and harder to prove innocence. Let’s not become distracted. We must stay the course of investigating what ties there are between our new administration and Russia. \nIt is fun to laugh at Saturday Night Live’s satirical sketches with comedians playing the parts of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, but this is no laughing matter. Wage war against collusion and corruption at the top! \nLynn Barry; Hume, N.Y. Policing the USA \nLetter to the editor: \nIvanka, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. must stand up and persuade their father to step down as president. \nTrump’s disrespect for the presidency is corrupting our political culture. His mendacity in spreading toxic lies about anyone who opposes his pursuit of power is bottomless. His ignorance of the basic functions and responsibilities of the presidency is inexplicable. His likely compromising of American security and sovereignty with political, financial and personal connections with Russia is unprecedented in American history. \nTrump is a broken person who, at age 70, cannot be made whole. He cannot be shamed into resigning. He will not be impeached by congressional Republicans, who don’t possess a shred of decency and patriotism to do so. Only the kids can save their father and their brand from further shame and inevitable destruction. It doesn’t matter if they don’t do it to save the dignity and importance of the presidency. It doesn’t matter if they don’t do it to prevent the next war. It’s OK if their motives are strictly personal and familial. They just need to do it. \nWalt Zlotow; Glen Ellyn, Ill. \nWe asked our followers to share their thoughts on interactions between Russian officials and President Trump’s campaign. Tweets are edited for clarity and grammar: \nIt’s a disgrace for this country. It looks like Trump is in it, up to his eyeballs. Let’s call it #Trustgate, it needs a name. \n— @BartRehbein_59 \nThe truth lies somewhere in the middle. Frankly, both sides are party to this activity, always. \n— @PirateVoice1952 \nTreason is treason. Ongoing discussion with Russia during campaign process, at the very least, demands scrutiny. \n— @MelissaMermaid \nDid anyone care about the Clinton Foundation’s interactions with the Russians? I think that would be a “no.” \n— @CarolynD72355 \nWhen you keep information from your vice president, when you try to deflect or say, well so-and-so did such-and-such, there is definitely something underhanded. \n— @angelmhunter \nFor more, follow @USATOpinion and #tellusatoday . 28 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read  //usat.ly/2lkI59r NEVER MISS OUT Opinion Once you know the news, it’s time to understand it.
