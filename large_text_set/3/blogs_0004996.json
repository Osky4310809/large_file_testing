Only if you win will people remember you.'' \nChelsea won the 2014-15 title, but last season's 10th-placed finish sees them absent from Europe. \nJose Mourinho, Conte's predecessor, has continually bemoaned his Manchester United side's congested fixture list, pointing to Chelsea's comparatively light schedule, while not acknowledging his role in the Blues being absent from European football. \nAnd Conte says it is imperative Chelsea return to the Champions League next season. Antonio Conte wants his players to celebrate a Premier League title, not individual awards. \nUnited, Manchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool are all battling to finish in the top four. \n\"The Champions League, I think, must be an appointment for us every year. It must be [at] our house,'' Conte added. \n\"We started our season trying to fight until the end to win the title and to try and fight until the end to be in the right position to go into next season's Champions League. This was our target. \n\"It wasn't easy to start the season and know that six strong teams fight for the title and the Champions League. \n\"Don't forget, in this six teams, two won't play in the Champions League next season. They have to go into the Europa League, which is a bit different. \n\"Now this league is very, very difficult. To win the title and also to find a place to play the Champions League is not easy.'' \nChelsea's most recent Premier League away game was a draw at Burnley. \nAnd Conte compared that with their next opponents in claret and blue, West Ham. \n\"This game against West Ham, for us, is very important,'' Conte said. \n\"In the last away game, the way we played against Burnley, we drew. They played very physical football against us. \n\"Maybe it can happen, the same, against West Ham on Monday. \n\"But for this reason we are preparing for this type of situation. It will be a really tough game.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:32:08.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
