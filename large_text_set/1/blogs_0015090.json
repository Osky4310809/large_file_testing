REUTERS/Carlo Allegri. 5423778 \nGOP President-elect Donald Trump ratcheted up his war with the intelligence community Sunday by asking if CIA Director John Brennan himself was responsible for leaking a dossier of unverified information to the press about Trump’s alleged escapades in Russia. \nAfter Brennan appeared on “Fox News Sunday” to call Trump’s comparison of the intelligence community to Nazi Germany “outrageous,” Trump fired of a series of tweets, in which he questioned whether Brennan was personally behind BuzzFeed’s recent publication of a 35-page dossier of totally unverified information on Trump. \n“What I do find outrageous is equating intelligence community with Nazi Germany,” Brennan said earlier on Sunday. “I do take great umbrage with that and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly.” \nBrennan said during that same interview that “there is no interest in undermining the president-elect.” \nBut Trump doesn’t appear convinced, despite statements from Brennan and also from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper earlier this week that the intelligence community had nothing to do with the leak of the dossier , which BuzzFeed published last Tuesday. BuzzFeed has since been widely castigated for publishing the completely unverified dossier full of bizarre information about Trump’s alleged, scandalous activities in Russia. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
