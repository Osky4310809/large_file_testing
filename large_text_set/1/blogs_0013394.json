We may not agree on everything,” Pence said, “but we all agree that the success of our country depends on the success of our cities and, more importantly, the success of every American wherever they call home.” \n“The president-elect and I are determined to forge strong partnerships between the federal government and the cities of this country. Make no mistake about it, we both believe that you have some of the most important jobs in public service,” he said. \nPence urged the mayors to consider the Trump administration an ally. \n“Our president-elect believes, as I do, that the federal government can play a critical role in helping our cities thrive,” he said, adding that “in the days, and months, and years that lie ahead, we’re going to work with each and every one of you regardless of political party to make America great again.” \nThe vice president-elect urged the mayors to remember Trump has a strong connection with city life. \n“Remember, after all, he’s a New Yorker , through and through,” Pence said.
