Giphy \nIf you happen to be one of those people who camps out in front of the window after every single rainstorm with the hopes of seeing one of these multicolor miracles, you might want to brace yourself. \nYou’re about to be more exciting than that guy who became a meme after recording his hilarious reaction to seeing a double rainbow in Yosemite National Park. A “fire rainbow” lit up the sky in Singapore for 15 minutes on February 20, and this stunning display of light looked downright magical. Instagram No really: The only thing missing from this magical AF scene was a leprechaun on a unicorn riding around this this blazing ball of light. Instagram As you can image, people freaked out when they noticed this fantastic “fire rainbow” in the sky and immediately ran outside to snap pictures of this rare sight. Instagram Bernard Ong, a pet stylist who was one of the many people who captured the bougie rainbow, said, “I have never seen such a beautiful Mother Nature before. This was totally something amazing. Someone said it looks like a UFO, too.” Instagram Now, if you’re wondering what sets this particular type of rainbow apart from the ordinary streaks of light that sometimes appear in the sky, it’s quite simple. Incredible footage shows breathtaking 'fire rainbow' in the sky To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video “Fire rainbows,” which are actually known as circumhorizon arcs, occur when light bursts through ice-crystal clouds at high altitudes. Instagram The sun must be at least 58 degrees high in order to create these colorful circumhorizon arcs, so these rare rainbows are more likely to be spotted in places near the equator, or during the summer season. Instagram Some people compared this incredible rainbow to a magical portal floating in the sky. Instagram Other onlookers compared this psychedelic sighting to a “paddle pop,” aka a multicolored popsicle that’s popular in Singapore. Instagram If you ask me, this thing basically looks like a giant glowing ball of light wearing a tie-dyed shirt. A lucky onlooker, Natalie Claudia Wong, said, “This was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, and I literally turned on Facebook Live to share the exact moment that I saw it. I was feeling pretty down over the past week, but this immediately lifted my spirits.” Instagram Yep, rainbows definitely have a way of doing that to you, Natalie.
