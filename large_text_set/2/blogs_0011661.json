While the star lowkey released a total bop with Cashmere Cat in September in the middle of her hiatus, it seems that the star is finally readying new music , the first of which is a brand new song with dance producer Kygo .\nWe know that Selena and Kygo have been spending time together , and both musicians have been teasing their collaboration for a while. In fact, SelGo shared some videos of herself bopping to the new track, which is titled “It Ain’t Me.”\nQueen #selenagomez @selenagomez \nA post shared by Selena Gomez Snapchats ♡ (@selenasnapchats) on Feb 14, 2017 at 1:56pm PST \nNow Kygo and Selena Gomez have shared the full audio for “It Ain’t Me” and it’s a total bop. The song’s lyrics deal with a relationship ruined by drink and drugs, with Selena singing:\n“ Who’s gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? / Who’s gonna rock you when the sun won’t let you sleep? / Who’s waking up to drive you home when you’re drunk and all alone?/ Who’s gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?/ It ain’t me.” As is the current trend in dance-pop music, the song then drops into a stabs of house-y pianos, tropical beats, and electrionic vocals. However, as Bradley Stern of PopCrush / MuuMuse notes, the “drop” is actually comprised of the lyrics “bowery” and “whiskey neat,” which is a nice touch.\nIt's finally here! Listen to my new song #ItAintMe with @KygoMusic on @AppleMusic ! https://t.co/jBKYNmM4GY \n— Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) February 16, 2017 While the song is the first taste of what Selena has been working on while she’s been on hiatus, “It Ain’t Me” is not the first taste of music from the singer’s upcoming third solo album. Instead, the track is a standalone bop, and is being billed as Kygo featuring Selena Gomez.\nListen to “It Ain’t Me” below. Tbh, we can *totally* see this becoming our new musical obsession. It’s really catchy, and we love the blend of acoustic guitar and tropical beats. We also love how vulnerable and emotive Selena sounds, too, and that by the end there’s an element of empowerment.\nWe’re fans!\nKygo’s “It Ain’t Me” featuring Selena Gomez is available now .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:39:37.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
