Winnings paid as free bets. T&C's apply. \nThe blockbuster game pits together two teams separated by just a single point at the top of the table, with the Seagulls holding the slightest of advantages after 33 games of the season. \nNewcastle are the top scorers in the division with 64 goals to their name this campaign. While Brighton boast the best defence in the second tier, Benitez's men are second in that regard, leaking just once more than their title rivals. This game looks very tricky to call, with the best home team taking on the side that have picked up the most points on their travels this season. \nBrighton are a best priced 6/4 (2.50) shot with Betfair to pick up a victory that would extend their lead to four points while the draw is a 2/1 (3.0) chance. That short price demonstrates just how tricky it is to split these two teams, so the chance to take Newcastle at 12/1 (13.0) instead of the usual 11/5 (3.20) certainly looks tempting. \nThe pre-season favourites, the visitors may not be blowing away everyone in their path as some may have expected but their expensively assembled squad certainly looks like it will achieve the ultimate aim of ensuring the Magpies bounce back to the top flight at the first opportunity. \nWith a 2-0 win over the south coast club at St James' Park earlier in the season, the away win is far from out of the question and at 12/1 (13.0) anyone without a Paddy Power account can take a big price to potentially kick start their bankroll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:54:13.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
