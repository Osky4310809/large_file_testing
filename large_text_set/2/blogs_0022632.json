The El Segundo option will actually take over the former downtown post office, with plans for a pour-it-yourself setup little seen in Los Angeles.\nOpening in late March, Brewport will offer 60 full taps for everything from root beer to red wine to kombucha to craft beer, plus a full kitchen for food under chef/partner Rob Rice. Look for casual pub fare and baguette sandwiches down the line.\nAs for the drinks, look for a new iPourIt system to take over the heavy lifting for customers looking to drink rather seamlessly. Basically, guests have to turn in a form of ID and a credit card, and in exchange get a wristband filled with a prepaid amount of credits to use at the requisite machine. Bring the band up to the sensor point, pick your drink and number of ounces to enjoy, and wait for the pour. Partners Gina Tarber (Cicerone-trained) and Kristian Krieger should be on hand to help with any inevitable hiccups.\nThe casual El Segundo space should come online in a few weeks. Expect the requisite brick and wood, with a vague aviation theme throughout. This isn’t likely to be quite the beauty of Downtown’s new Mikkeller, but something solid for the South Bay nonetheless. When it opens, expect Brewport Tap House to keep hours from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, with an extension to midnight Friday and Saturday, plus 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. hours on Sunday.\nBrewport Tap House \n204 Main Street \nEl Segundo, CA ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:54:45.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
