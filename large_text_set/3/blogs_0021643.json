So, we now dismiss D for development and replace it with drama because while the win was overwhelming, the joke was on us. It’s nothing new, if you are on social media there is no winning anyway but over the last few days instead of twitter which is an endless canvas for trolling, the reaction on Facebook has been more surprising. On a private page that only friends some of whom may not be ‘like-minded’ but are definitely educated have access to it’s been let us just say, far from polite. Irony died many deaths as they tried to convincingly defend a man who threatens violence at the drop of a slogan as the messiah for a lawless state. Clearly, CBSE will never teach us life lessons. \n“Have you been to Gorakhpur” they taunt me. “Have you” is what I want to ask them. The easiest thing to do these days is to sit on a couch and label anyone with an opposing view ‘Lutyens Delhi’, ‘chattering class’ or the predictable Liberals and Presstitutes. Bashing the press for a newsbreak may be justified in certain instances but is also equally fashionable these days. Shooting the messenger though will not take away Yogi Adityanath’s rabble rousing speeches or dark threats. Yet there is a justification and from colleagues who were in the same classroom when we studied the Divide and Rule policy. Guess the British are still having the last laugh. \nI recently put up a post to my friends on FB asking a very basic non-political question whether we should now teach our kids that good guys don’t always finish first? Isn’t the message today for the younger generation that you can be a wolf in sheep’s clothing or robes but you will still get rewarded? Yes, everyone should get a second chance but redemption and rehab happen when you are teenagers caught drinking outside curfew hours. At 44, you will not change. In one of his relatively polite speeches, Yogi Adityanath asked those opposing Surya Namaskar to leave the country or drown in the ocean. So, Modi may have kept the trouble maker closest by making the class bully the monitor but will he be able to control his violent thinking? A telling response from a friend to my post, teach our kids to simply be good human beings, reality hits soon enough! \nOn a side note the fascination with Yogi Adityanath’s age has equally flummoxed me, nor do I care that he is older or younger than Rahul Gandhi who the same armchair critics presume is my leader simply because their leader isn’t my chosen one. For the record, frankly I don’t care about RG’s age because a year here or there isn’t going to make him a born-again leader. \nSo, I am still confused because the new ‘Modi masterstroke’ that those around me are singing paeans about makes me wonder what is it that I am really missing? Are we so jaded that it is all relative, “which politician doesn’t have a criminal case against him” or has our hardline belief deeply entrenched us in denial “criminal charges against the new CM have not been proved”. The most random justification has been his educational qualifications but I guess in a country obsessed with college degrees a maths graduate does sound calculating! So, while we agree to disagree on most things, lets at least admit the BJP as a political party is no different. \nThe biggest fallacy is taking a sense of false security from the way Yogi Adityanath dresses. In the same ascetic robes, he has threatened violence, rape and much worse. At least Baba Ramdev makes no pretence of his business empire. But like the proverbial Lutyens Delhi, Yogi Adityanath’s new found admirers are no less removed themselves, socialising in the comforts of their drawing rooms. Despite Yogi’s past being public knowledge, former BJP MP Chandan Mitra has astoundingly called him a level-headed man. Everyone has a right to their opinion but it matters when the threats are not to your family or even anyone you know. One wonders if they would still be thumping their chests if the women around them were targeted like this, “when men acquire women-like qualities they become God but when women acquire men-like qualities they become rakshas”. But these are also the same people who a few weeks ago applauded the threats to Gurmehar kaur and insisted that their girls will continue to go to Delhi University but will not raise their voice. Well done my friends, in your irrational exuberance it’s back to the dark future for your own children and you have no right to blame anyone but yourself. \nMany of those supporting Adityanath went to elite boarding schools just as several like me come from small town India. The chattering class liberals then is just a bunch of people who don’t prescribe to a certain view, the majority view. But questioning the old belief that absolute power corrupts absolutely is our right. Getting personal or nasty because we choose to judge someone on his record is not yours. But this once you get the benefit of the doubt. Its tiring defending the indefensible, especially when you can’t even point Gorakhpur on the map.
