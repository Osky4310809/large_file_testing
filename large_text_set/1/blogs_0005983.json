Figurehead, Helm, and Anchors Edit Thousand Sunny's figurehead, helm, and anchors. \nThe figurehead of the Thousand Sunny is a large lion face with two crossbones behind it in the manner of a Jolly Roger . The mouth of the figurehead can open in order to reveal the Gaon Cannon for frontal attacks, and the lion's mane can rotate like a propeller to move the ship backwards if needed. \nThe Thousand Sunny's helm is located at the front of the ship. Unlike the conventional steering wheels found on traditional sailing ships, the position of the Sunny's steering wheel resembles those found on modern ships. The controls for the Soldier Dock System are located on the steering wheel itself. A knob allows one to choose which compartments to position at the opening on the side of the ship, and a lever situated next to the wheel can then used to open the compartments. A bench is conveniently located near the steering wheel. The Sunny also has a built-in Log Pose, located on a metal pillar of medium height which stands directly behind the ship's helm. \nThe anchors of the Thousand Sunny are positioned at each side of the front of the ship and resemble large lion paws, each with three toes. The ropes used to raise and lower them are stored inside the metal ring positioned behind the figurehead. \nAfter the timeskip, Franky installed searchlights in the eyes of the lion figurehead. \nRecently, the figurehead has shown some anthropomorphic expressions, much like the Going Merry's did. The lion made a dizzy face in the manga when the Straw Hats got caught in a White Strom [5] and, in the anime, a panicked face when they were surrounded by Sea Kings during their descent to Fishman Island. Men's and Women's Quarters Edit The Men's and Women's Quarters. \nThe men's quarters is located on the first floor of the fore of the ship, while the women's quarters is located above them on the second floor. \nThe men's quarters can be entered from either door on the first floor. In the middle of the room is a horigotatsu type kotatsu, a traditional Japanese fireplace setting, complete with a sunken table and low sofas. Suspended from the ceiling like wooden hammocks are three double-decker bunks, which the men sleep in. Behind these bunks, at the back of the room, are six lockers where the men can store their clothes. Posted on the wall of the room is a collection of the men's wanted posters; however, because of his ongoing problem with getting photographed properly, Sanji's poster is not included. A hatch in the men's quarters leads down into a storage room below deck. \nThe women's quarters can be entered through the door on the second floor. Unlike the men's quarters, which looks more typical for a ship, the women's quarters resembles more a bedroom one would see on land. It contains two beds, a bookshelf, a four-door closet, a vanity with a mirror, and some comfy sofas, among other things. A treasure chest belonging to Nami can be found behind the beds. Since the timeskip, the two beds have been replaced by a single king sized bed. [6] \nAt the entrance to each room is a washroom. The room by the men's quarters' entrance is a typical household washroom setup. It contains a regular sink and some toothbrushes. The only other unique feature in this room is a bell to wake everyone up in case of emergencies or other important situations. The washroom by the women's quarters entrance is somewhat more elaborate. It contains a closet where wine and a tea set can be stored. While cold, fresh water for both washrooms is provided by internal pumps and filters, hot water for the tea set must be retrieved from the kitchen. There is also a door to the right in each bedroom which leads to a narrow space containing a cannon. \nIn front of these rooms, on the lawned deck, is a hatch leading to the room where the Soldier Dock System is stored. Toilets are located outside, under the stairwells that circle the foremast. Kitchen, Dining Room, and Sick Bay Edit The Kitchen, Dining Room, and Sick bay. \nThe kitchen, dining room and sick bay are located on the second floor near the stern of the ship. \nThe combined kitchen and dining room of the ship resembles a restaurant, with the two areas separated by a bar. The kitchen has a professional setup and cooking equipment, including a giant oven that can bake anything and a giant fridge with a lock, something Sanji has requested many times in order to stop people (mainly Luffy ) from stealing food. The fridge lock is secured by a four digit code, \"7326\", which is known only to Sanji, Nami , and Robin . The code is a combination of their names. 7 and 3 can be pronounced as \"na\" and \"mi\" respectively in Japanese and thus refer to Nami. Likewise, 2 and 6 can be pronounced as \"ni\" and \"ro\" respectively and thus refer to the two first syllables of Nico Robin's full name. 3 and 2 can also be pronounced as \"san\" and \"ji\" and thus refer to Sanji. A pantry used to store dry goods can be accessed by a door adjacent to the fridge and by a door outside; to discourage Luffy from raiding the supplies here, only raw, unprocessed groceries are kept inside. Next to the kitchen is the main mast of the ship; built within it is a dumbwaiter that can be used to deliver food to the aquarium bar below. The area also contains a ladder that leads to a hatch giving access to the observation deck above. A Den Den Mushi can also be found near the couch in the dining room. \nUnlike the Going Merry, the Thousand Sunny has a sick bay. It can be accessed from both the dining room and the outside of the ship. The room contains various medical supplies and furniture, including a desk, a bed, and Chopper's favorite swivel chair. It is generally used to treat any wounds the Straw Hats might receive. When not in use, it can serve as a passageway to the back of the ship. During the room's first appearance, without any patients to cure, Chopper was seen relaxing in the sick bay. As the ship's doctor, Chopper considers the sick bay his own personal room. He also keeps his signature from Sogeking hanging up on the wall, even though it was just Usopp wearing a disguise, choosing to keep it anyway as a memento from his adventures and a gift from his friend - or because he never actually found out Usopp was indeed Sogeking. Aquarium Bar Edit The Aquarium Bar. \nThis room provides great place for storing live fish (to eat later) and has glass walls that allow the aquarium to be viewed from the adjacent lounge. The aquarium surrounds the whole room and functions as a ceiling for a passageway behind it. To take a fish out of the aquarium for food, one must net the fish from the hatch on the second floor deck. If that does not work, they'll just have to dive in and grab it themselves. \nIn the middle of the room is the main mast of the ship, which contains a small cupboard for storing alcohol and a dumbwaiter connecting to the kitchen above. Due to the room's atmosphere, Franky says it's a good place to eat dinner. When the aquarium was first shown in use, Luffy and Usopp foolishly put a shark in, and it unfortunately devoured all the other fish in the tank. \nThe energy room of the Thousand Sunny can be entered through a ladder at the back of this room. Library, Workrooms, Bath, Crow's Nest, and Survey Room Edit The Library, Workrooms, and Bathhouse. \nThe large hut-like structure at the stern of the ship contains the bath and library. At each side of this building is a large lamp. The library, comprising the lower level of the structure, is a large circular room with numerous bookshelves and windows and a bench encircling the whole room. Everyone but Luffy has books stored here. In the middle of the room is Nami's mapping desk, which contains the Ship's Log, among other things. Toward the port side is a ladder leading up to the bath. The library, according to Nami, is \"the brain of the Sunny.\" [7] \nAbove the library, located in the attic-like section of the building, is the bath. From the ladder in the library, one enters a front washroom with an accessible toilet before passing through a door into the actual bath. It contains a much larger bathtub than there was on the Merry. In Nami's words, taking a bath there while the ship gently rocks has the feel of a high-end spa. The Crow's Nest and Survey Room. \nOn top of the foremast is the crow's nest. It is a dome-shaped hut with several windows on its perimeter. It can be entered by climbing up the ropes surrounding the mast and then climbing a ladder up through a hole in the nest's metal floor. It contains some advanced telescopic equipment and a microphone. The microphone is connected to a loud speaker located below the crow's nest to the rear, enabling anyone inside to quickly relay news to the crew below. The crow's nest can also function as a gym, containing exercising equipment such as dumbbells and giving ample room so that even someone of Zoro's level can train effectively. Like the library, the crow's nest also features a bench around the edge. \nOn top of the kitchen and dining hall of the Thousand Sunny is the observation deck. It can be accessed by going through a hatch from the kitchen below, and it gives access to the library. Much like the top deck of the Going Merry, it contains Nami's mikan trees and Robin's flower garden. It also has the chimney for the kitchen below, the branch office of Usopp's Factory, and, since the time skip, Usopp's Pop Green garden. \nBelow the deck, and to the aft of the Soldier Dock System, are the two rooms devoted to research and development: Usopp's Main Factory and Franky's Weapon Development Room. Both are complete with drawing boards and tools for the creation of blueprints and contraptions for the Straw Hats' use in the near future. Both can be accessed by climbing down the stairs leading from the Energy Room. Features Edit \nThe Thousand Sunny has many features that the crew has long coveted, along with some nice additions Franky added himself, most of which are, naturally, powered by Cola , usually from the ship's Energy Room. These additions include the Soldier Dock System and other unique internal contraptions. Soldier Dock System Edit \nThe Soldier Dock System ( ソルジャードックシステム , Sorujaa Dokku Shisutemu ? ) is a special system built within the ship and represented externally by two giant numbered plates, one on either side of the ship. It is a turntable comprised of six compartments that each contains a special device or vehicle for the Straw Hats' use. It is named Soldier Dock System because the vehicles stored within are, as Franky calls them, the soldiers of the Thousand Sunny. [8] The Soldier Dock System prior to its modification. Sunny's new engine. Channel Zero: two compartments containing paddle wheels that change the ship into Paddle-Wheel Sunny. It is powered by cola . The wheels can rotate in reverse and function independently of one another. With these wheels, the Thousand Sunny's heading can be changed easily. This was first seen being used in the manga when Franky used it in order to pass a raging storm. [9] In the anime, it was first seen being used to escape from the illusion of a Marine fleet. [10] After the timeskip, the paddle wheels were removed to make room for Channels Five and Six [11] . In their place, a powerful new engine was added and can be deployed under the ship, although this was only seen in the anime.
