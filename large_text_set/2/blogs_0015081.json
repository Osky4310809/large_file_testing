(Image: Reuters) \nIndian rupee strengthened further on Monday tracking strong local shares, rising for a second consecutive session. The rupee closed on Monday at 66.92 per dollar, up 9 paise or 0.13%, after trading strong for most of the day as foreign capital inflows chased surging equity markets, which rose for a third consecutive session. \nIt opened weaker at 67.06 per dollar and remained in the range of 67.07-66.90 through the day. The absence of the US investors on account of a public holiday, too, helped the stability in the currency. \nToday, the Indian currency may not show much volatility in the absence of any major triggers. \n“The USD/INR is likely to remain in tight range of 66.90-67.10 as there are no major domestic and international events which could drive the pair,” IFA Global said in a research note. \nThe rupee has gained 15 paise, or 0.21% in two days. Earlier Friday, the rupee had risen to end at 67.01. \nMeanwhile, BSE Sensex rose 0..68% to end at 28,661.58 points, as telecom stocks lifted markets after news of major consolidation moves gaining momentum. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 8,043.14 crore last Friday, according to the provisional data. \nYou may also like to watch: \nLater this week, the US Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its 31 January -1 February Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which may include clues to the members’ views on the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s policies. \nEarlier this morning, in the overseas currency markets, the euro eased to $1.06090 EUR=, having moved little on Monday, again, partly as the US investors were absent from the market. It has fallen 1.75% so far this month. Against the yen, the euro traded at 120.15 yen EURJPY=R, off from lows of 119.65 yen on Monday. \nThis year, the rupee has gained 1.45%. Foreign institutional investors have bought $373.20 million and $567 million from local equity and debt markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:50:03.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
