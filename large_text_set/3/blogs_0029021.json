It is whip-smart, hugely timely and driven by some great new talent. I'd like to thank all the teams who contributed to the different pilots. The standard was exceptionally high, but we were drawn to The Mash Report’s blend of great satire allied with the surreal. It feels really innovative.” \nKate Phillips says: “All three pilots delivered a great mix of terrific talent and original ideas, but Princess has provided BBC Two with a fresh and very funny format featuring an exceptional group of writers and performers. We can't wait to get cracking.” \nChris Stott, Executive Producer at Princess Productions, says: “We’re thrilled that the BBC has given us this fantastic opportunity to showcase such a brilliant, diverse range of up-and-coming comedic talent. There has never been a better time to bring acerbic and topical comedy to the channel.” \nThe 10 x 30’ series will be executive produced by Chris Stott and joint Head of Programmes Anna Blue and Will Spokes for Princess Productions (part of the Endemol Shine Group). BBC joint commissioning editors for The Mash Report are Pinki Chambers and Alan Tyler. \nKT \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:12:21.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
