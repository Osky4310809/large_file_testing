Chinese users would have to go through a VPN to access the site.\nIt's unclear if Chen was part of the 350 jobs (or 9 percent of its workforce) that Twitter announced it would cut in Oct. 2016.\nHer departure comes shortly after Twitter lost a number of senior executives in Asia.\nIn November, both Twitter's head for India and its managing director for India, Southeast Asia, Australia and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) announced they were leaving.\nChen bid the latter adieu as well on Twitter.\n@parrysingh Thank you! Hope to see you again somewhere sometimeðŸ˜Š.\nâ€” Kathy Chen (@kathychen2016) January 3, 2017\nWhen Chen was hired in April, Chinese Twitter users (many in the U.S.) expressed fears that her history working for the Chinese military was indicative of the company bowing to government pressure to censor content.\nIt's no secret that China's answer to Twitter, Sina Weibo, is screened, and deletes posts or blocks search terms depending on official instruction.\nBONUS: Trump's 5-year-old granddaughter Arabella is huge in China", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/T1EIsURx.m3u8", "https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/05/twitter-estimates-that-it-has-10-million-users-in-china/", "https://twitter.com/parrysingh", "https://twitter.com/kathychen2016/status/815116833145487360", "https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kathy-chen-78b56214", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/T1EIsURx.jpg", "https://twitter.com/kathychen2016/status/816152288486047745"], "published": "2017-01-03T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:09:39.920+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
