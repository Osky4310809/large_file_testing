Newell \nSeemingly, Sarah Gables let out her frustration on a 4-year-old — a child whose parents trusted her supervision. And, it’s all on video. \nThings aren’t looking too good for this former Upper Darby, Pennsylvania daycare worker. After footage was released of 52-year-old Sarah Gable mistreating one of the children, the community is in an uproar. Heart breaking 2 see the evil Daycare worker #SarahGable shoving child down steps https://t.co/893xZLEguc \n— Buzzkill (@JustAnotherFunk) March 7, 2017 \nThe incident happened at Childcare of the Future, on the 700 block of Secane Avenue in Primos — around 5:15 p.m. on Friday, March 3. \nThe video captures the daycare worker as she enters into the stairway behind the child. As the 4-year-old begins to descend the steps, Sarah Gable forcefully pushes her down a flight and into the wall. \nThe child doesn’t immediately get up. And, in the the same moment Gable realizes her troubles, she looks directly into the newly-installed camera above her. You can see the instant worry on the daycare worker’s face as she turns to “help” the child down the stairs. \nGiven the photo clarity, she may as well had said “Cheese!” . @UDPolice : Day care worker charged, video shows child pushed down steps https://t.co/jEuHDdycnA pic.twitter.com/MfVDismGg5 \n— The Morning Call (@mcall) March 7, 2017 \nBy the time she reaches the bottom of the stairway, another daycare worker is there to meet her. \nIf you’re interested in the video, you can watch it below. . @UDPolice arrest day care worker accused of shoving 4-year-old girl down stairs: https://t.co/wPxwPosYMV pic.twitter.com/EoBBtsIBo2 \n— NBC10 Philadelphia (@NBCPhiladelphia) March 6, 2017 \nActually, the person at the bottom of the steps was daycare administrator Shawayne Tavares. \nAccording to ABC News – Philadelphia , the daycare camera had been installed only moments before the incident occurred. And, Tavares happened to be monitoring its footage at the time Sarah Gable pushed the 4-year-old. \nTavares notes the following statements. \n“I was so upset. It just hurt me. We don’t treat children here like that. So, it was like, ‘Why would you do that? Why would you push a child down the steps.’ And the way she did it was just so carelessly as if she’d been doing it.” \nAccording to NBC 10 – Philadelphia , Tarvares also states that the daycare worker attempted to lie as she walked down the steps with the child. \n“She picked up the shoe and tried to come to the end of the stairs like, ‘Oh, it was her shoe’,” says Tarvares. “I’m like, ‘It’s not her shoe. I saw you. I just watched you on camera do it’.” \nThe child suffered a knee injury but was still able to return to the school the following class day. \nThere’s no information regarding whether the camera’s installation was the effect of ongoing complaints about Sarah Gable. \nHowever, Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood had this to say about the situation. \n“When parents give their kids to daycare centers, the expectation is that their children are going to be taken care of.” \nUpper Darby Police Department also tweeted various thanks for the community’s support in making them knowledgeable of this story. \n“Thanks for bringing awareness to what we consider an important story for parents everywhere,” tweets the department. \nSince the incident occurred, Sarah Gable has been arrested.
