The Xiaomi Redmi 4A India was first launched in China in November last year, along with Redmi 4.\nThe Redmi 4 launches soon after the best-selling Redmi Note 4 that launched in India in January. The Redmi 4A sports a polycarbonate body that is just 8.5 mm thin, and weighs a little over 131 grams. The dual SIM smartphone packs in an infrared sensor so that it can be used as a universal remote for a variety of consumer appliances. However, the device does not include a fingerprint sensor, a fair omission in a device in this price range.\nXiaomi Redmi 4A Specifications Operating System: Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 8 Display: 5-inch HD (720×1280 pixels) IPS Processor: 1.4GHz 64-bit Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 | Adreno 308 GPU RAM: 2GB Internal Storage: 16GB; expandable up to 128GB with microSD card Rear Camera: 13MP | f/2.2 aperture | 5-piece lens Front Camera: 5MP | f/2.2 aperture Battery: 3120mAh Priced at ₹5,999 ($92), the Xiaomi Redmi 4A is available in three color variants – Dark Grey, Gold, and a new addition, the Rose Gold – and will be available exclusive on Amazon and Mi.com, starting March 23, 2017 at 12 noon.
