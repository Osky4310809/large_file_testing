Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said the process was fast but also fully public. \n“Unlike Obamacare , where members of this Committee were presented a 794-page bill at midnight for voting mere hours later, the 57-page bill before us today was posted two days ago for all of America to read,” Brady said. \nIn a statement released after the vote, he said that the committee’s actions shows Republicans are serious about keeping President Donald Trump’s pledge to replace Obamacare.

I sincerely thank my colleagues for their hard work and commitment to delivering on the President’s promise,” he said. \nThe bill, unveiled Monday, has been the target of widespread criticism from Democrats, conservative Republicans and healthcare groups such as the American Medial Association and the American Hospital Association. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested the White House was not planning to appease all critics.
