After exchanging texts, the reality that they were dancing finally dawned on them. \n“At first, we were just saying, ‘What did we sign up for? I can’t believe we are standing for 46 hours,’” Wolverton said. “That’s the moment that it hit us, and then we were talking about how excited but nervous we were.” \nClub track and field is in its fifth year of raising money for THON, Wolverton said, and the team’s total annual contributions have increased steadily since she and Filipovits arrived on campus. \nWolverton estimated that they raised about $2,800 her freshman year, earning only a single ticket into the THON dancer lottery. \nThis year they raised close to $10,000 as a team, citing the team’s growth over those two years as the driving force behind its incremental surge in fundraising totals. \n“I would say it was really cool because in the past, we’d get in the lottery and we’d kind of try to hype it up, and then we don’t get dancers,” Wolverton said. “So this year we were able to follow through with it.” \nThough Wolverton and Filipovits will be the ones dancing this weekend, they insist they are simply the ones reaping the award for a team accomplishment. \n“I think it’s just really cool that everyone on the track team comes from different walks of life,” Wolverton said. “And so, I think for us too, it’s really cool to be able to bring that all together and stand for them, as well, because they’ve all worked really hard the past three years.” \nJust like the other 700-plus dancers, the duo will have to find a way to endure the 46-hour dance marathon. Their athletic backgrounds, they hope, will make being on their feet for nearly two days more attainable. \nFilipovits is an accomplished hurdler and high-jumper who owns the Penn State club track and field record in the 60- and 100-meter hurdles, as well as the pentathlon. \nShe placed in the top 10 in four different events at the National Intercollegiate Running Club Association national meet, including a first-place finish in the 100-meter hurdles. \nA mid-distance runner, Wolverton is part of the 4x400 teams that own the indoor and outdoor club records. Her 4x400 team placed first in last year’s national meet, and she placed 14th in the individual 400. \n“I think it gave both of us a lot of confidence in our abilities, just being athletic, along with training hard, and we’re just coming off of our indoor season,” Filipovits said. “So, I think that helps a lot with just knowing that physically I think we both can do it.” \nWhere other dancers have to prepare to take on the physical challenges of dancing for 46 hours, Filipovits and Wolverton said they’re focusing on making sure their minds are properly equipped for the task ahead. \nThe knowledge that their teammates will be behind them through it all, though, is making all of that preparation worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:46:40.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
