As a member of the lab, he witnessed on a regular basis the inefficiencies of basic laboratory work that he felt were ripe for robotic optimization.\" \nNeither Hodak nor Musk were immediately available for comment. \nIn addition to his responsibilities running Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has taken a keen interest in artificial intelligence, which he has at times characterized as a potential threat to the survival of the human species. \nTo that end, he is one of the sponsors of the the nonprofit OpenAI project, whose mission is to build AI that is \"safe,\" and ensure that the benefits of AI research are \"are as widely and evenly distributed as possible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:10:06.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
