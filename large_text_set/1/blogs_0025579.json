It might seem odd, but these beautiful animals are getting electrocuted on uninsulated power lines and transformers. While searching for food, monkeys have trouble telling electrical wires from natural vines and when they accidentally touch an electrical line, it can be fatal. Most of the animals who survive such incidents are baby monkeys who were clinging to their mothers when they were electrocuted. \nThat was exactly what happened to baby Vincent . Vincent was only a few weeks old when his mother tragically died after being electrocuted on an uninsulated transformer. Unfortunately, when she died she fell onto the live electrical current and Vincent was pinned against the transformer . Thankfully, Vincent was rescued by Refuge for Wildlife in Costa Rica. \nAmazingly, International Animal Rescue gave their support to the howler monkey rescue project started by Refuge for Wildlife in Costa Rica and has helped them increase the scope of their mission. International Animal Rescue will help the cause by contributing funds as well as spreading awareness and knowledge for the project and the team’s work. Thanks to rescuers, many of these amazing animals will receive medical treatment and get released back into the wild. Vincent suffered severe third degree burns to his hands and face, his left eye was burned shut, and most of his left earlobe was burnt off. Miraculously, he survived. The first few weeks after Vincent was rescue were incredibly difficult and clinic staff feared he was too young and frail to survive such injuries. The little one understandably missed his mother very much and cried constantly during his first days at the clinic. But with plenty of pain medication, antibiotics, and soothing burn cream (as well as lots of loving care), sweet Vincent began to heal from the horrific experience. We are thrilled to learn it has been more than two years since Vincent’s accident and he is doing well. According to International Animal Rescue , he is becoming more and more independent and loves to play, climb, and wrestle with the other orphaned babies. The goal is to return the rescued monkeys to their natural home as soon as possible. Once they are fully healthy and in a good physical shape, the young monkeys are released. \n\n\nAccording to a new study , the future survival of primates looks very uncertain and human actions and industries are to blame. If we don’t do as much as we can to help, more and more primates will face the serious risk of extinction. It is critically important to support causes like this one. \nTo learn more about the project and what you can do to help, click here . Even a small donation will go a long way to help these rescued monkeys! \nAll image source: International Animal Rescue Want to read more posts like this?
