Whether you need to charge your phone multiple times during a weekend away or just want to top it up before the commute home, you'll find something to suit your charging needs. Best headphones, earphones and earbuds Best USB Type-C battery pack \nUSB Type-C is found on more and more Android smartphones now, like the Google Pixel , and our best external battery recommendation in this category goes to the Anker PowerCore+ 20100. \nThis one is our favorite because it charges fast, has a large capacity and is sturdier than its closest competitors. At around $50, it's not the cheapest charger on the list, but this isn't an outrageous price for something with a capacity of 20,100 mAh. \nThis amount of stored power will easily charge your Android device several times over, and it can even charge multiple USB Type-C devices at the same time! For those who are looking for standard Micro-USB charging, there's another Anker battery pack in this list too, which is ideal for a weekend away. \nWhat's more, the PowerCore+ 20,100 features 10 LED lights on the face which display its current charge level rather effectively (some batteries only have a single on/off LED). Anker has the goods for USB Type-C charging. / © Anker Best portable charger for your wallet \nYes, credit card-size batteries do exist, but the TravelCard's style and performance ensure it's our current number one for your wallet. The TravelCard charger's dimensions come in at around 3.1 x 2.1 x 0.2 inches and it weighs just 57 grams. Its incredible sleekness – it's about three credit cards thick and only a little longer – means it's perfectly capable of fitting in a normal-sized wallet. \nThe TravelCard comes with cables built into its body to guarantee a compact feel and its 1,500 mAh of power will fill most modern smartphone batteries by around 30-40 percent. \nIt’s not especially fast to load your device – largely due to limitations caused by its size and heat transfer – and it’s also expensive for the capacity it holds. What you are paying a premium for here is the convenience. \nIt’s a good idea, well-presented, and could help you out when you're in a tight spot. Find it at their site via the link below. The TravelCard is small enough to fit inside a wallet. / © TravelCard Best external battery for your pocket \nWe recommend the Limefuel Blast L25X as the best pocket-sized portable charger. It measures just 3.6 x 1.5 x 0.8 inches and weighs only 2.3 oz – about the same as lip balm. \nThe Limefuel Blast L25X holds 2,500 mAh of power, which is not quite enough to fully charge most modern handsets but it's enough to give it a quick boost. The Blast L25X's price and portability make it a great value, no-hassle charging solution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:07:13.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
