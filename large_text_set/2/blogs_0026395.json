It centers on an idealistic young African-American police officer (Justin Cornwell) who is appointed to an elite squad of the LAPD where he is partnered with a seasoned, morally ambiguous detective ( Bill Paxton ). Will Beall created the series and exec produces alongside Jerry Bruckheimer, Jonathan Littman, KristieAnne Reed, Fuqua; Danny Cannon and showrunner Barry Schindel. “We are truly devastated at the passing of our friend Bill Paxton,” Bruckheimer said in a statement Sunday. \"He was a tremendously talented actor, and a wonderful man beloved by the entire Training Day cast and crew. Bill’s extraordinary body of work ensures that he will never be forgotten. Our heartfelt condolences to Bill’s family and friends. He will be missed more than we can possibly express.“ Cornwell paid tribute to his co-star on Twitter early Sunday: We were just two guys on top of the world.
