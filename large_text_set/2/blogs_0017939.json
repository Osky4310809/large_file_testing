Andretta \nIf you're interested in pottery or art, don't miss quaint Andretta village, a 20 minute drive from Palampur in the Kangra District. It can be visited on a day trip from Dharamsala. Otherwise, stay at the delightful Mirage Heritage Homestay. \nThe village is said to have been established in the 1920s by Irish playwright Norah Richards, who lived there during the Partition and is credited with the rise of Punjabi theater. Later, noted potter Gurucharan Singh (who started Delhi Blue Pottery), and painter Sobha Singh (who was known for his Sikh religious paintings), settled there. The Sobha Singh Art Gallery, housed in the building where he lived, showcases his paintings and personal belongings. The mud-plastered cottage belonging to Norah Richards can also be visited. \nAndretta Pottery and Craft Society, a pottery production center, offers three month pottery classes for serious students . Alternatively, you can try your hand at the pottery wheel and get a casual lesson. The Society apparently sells its rangoli-patterned earthenware to FabIndia in Delhi. Jitendra Singh/Getty Images. 5. Bir-Billing \nGo past the turnoff to Andretta from Palampur and you'll reach one of the world's best paragliding destinations at the twin towns of Bir and Billing.

Don't miss visiting the groovy 4Tables Project cafe and art gallery. They now rent out gorgeous rooms too! Guided walks in the area can be arranged. A village in the Spiti Valley. Sharell Cook. 6. Spiti \nRudyard Kipling described Spiti as a world within a world. This remote, high altitude area of Himachal Pradesh is tucked away against the border of Ladakh and Tibet. It's only been open to foreign tourists since 1991, and still remains relatively unexplored. Part of this is due to Spiti being barren alpine desert that's covered in heavy snow for a high proportion of the year. \nGetting to Spiti involves a long drive, most popularly from Manali. The constantly evolving scenery is unforgettable and well worth the journey though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:47.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
