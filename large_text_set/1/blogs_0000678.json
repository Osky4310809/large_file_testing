I always go there because it's really family-friendly. \n\"Roman was quite tired and he was being very impatient waiting for his food. I bought him a toy from the grabber machines and we did some colouring to keep him entertained. \n\"But it didn't work and when the food arrived, he refused to eat. I was trying to deal with my toddler who clearly thinks he is 15 - strolling around the pub like he owned it. I was at my wit's end.\" Read More Couple who saved up for New Year celebrations cancel plans and use money to help homeless instead \nBonnie said she was \"sweating profusely\" and wanted to cry - until a waitress came along and asked Roman to help her fold napkins. \nShe said: \"She sat him down at a table across from me and she showed him how to fold napkins and put them into a jar. \n\"He loves it when people give him attention and he really liked that he was helping. He came over to me and told me what he was doing because he was really proud.\" Bonnie shared this image and managed to track Kelly down and thank her (Photo: Nottingham Post) \nBonnie posted a picture of Roman and the staff member on Facebook as she wanted to give her recognition. \nThe post has since received over 1,600 'likes' and 109 shares. \nThe mum-of-one, who grew up in Stapleford, managed to track the waitress, Kelly Niblett, down to say thank you. \nShe said: \"Kids are beautiful nightmares, and when they misbehave you sometimes get a lot of people judging you so it was nice to see that people understand. \n\"It really does take a very special person to have such a massive impact on someone's life. She's an ordinary person doing an ordinary job in an extraordinary way. \n\"She wasn't doing it for any personal gain, she just genuinely cared about the fact that I was looking really stressed.\" \nKelly, who is a mum to two daughters aged three and seven, has worked at the restaurant for two-and-a-half-years. \nThe 31-year-old said: \"I have been in Bonnie's shoes a few times and had my little ones running around while trying to eat. As a single mum myself, I know the whole eating out scenario can be hard. \n\"I've tried everything before and found that kids love helping out. I had my napkins to do so I asked Roman to help because I know my daughter's would've liked doing it. \n\"I'm so happy just to help and be appreciated. \n\"Not everything costs money and it's the best feeling ever every time I see a new comment on the Facebook post.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:28:21.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
