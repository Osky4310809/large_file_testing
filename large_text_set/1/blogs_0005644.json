Instead, you've managed to make them look tired and tiny. You didn't do it on purpose, of course. You just went overboard with the smouldering eyeshadow and dark eyeliner, and now your eyes are barely visible. Not only this, sometimes the way we apply eyeliner makes our eyes look droopy. Ever wondered about the glitches in our make-up techniques? Well, these are seven mistakes we never realised we were making. Kohl on the waterline \nWe all have a habit of applying kohl on the lower waterline. While it will make your eyes look piercing if you have almond shaped eyes, you need to forgo this technique if you have small eyes. Instead, line your waterline with a nude liner to make your eyes appear bigger. Not curling your lashes \nYes, the eyelash curler looks a bit intimidating. But, you really need to get over your fear of using it. The curler alone can open up your eyes, without the need of any product. Placing a dark eyeshadow on the inner corner \nAs the inner corner of the eyes are already dark, so do not add a pigmented colour. Instead use a pearly cream eyeshadow to brighten those inner corners, and to make your eyes pop. Applying the wrong concealer \nThe undertone of you dark circles will determine the concealer you should be getting for your under-eye. Use a pinkish tint for green circles, and a peachy tint for blue or purple colored circles. This way the colours will counteract each other to hide the fact that you're tired. Curling lashes after mascara \nUnless you are intentionally going for clumpy lashes, do not curl your lashes after applying mascara. You will end up with mascara traces all over, and we are sure you don't want that. Using primer only for eyeshadows \nEyeshadow primers not only make you eyeshadow stay put, but they also hold your eyeliner. Swipe some primer on your lids, even if you are not considering wearing any make-up, and see how this formula will make your peepers pop. Applying the wrong cat eye \nWhen lining your eyes in an extended cat-eye style, make sure you are keeping the line upwards when extending it beyond the eye. When it's lined downwards, it can make the eyes look droopy and smaller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T12:17:10.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
