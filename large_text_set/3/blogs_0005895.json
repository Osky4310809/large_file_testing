After just a few weeks he has already had a major impact on the market and the economy. \nUsing Twitter as his platform, he has signaled a new direction for the nation and his administration. And the signals suggest he’s serious about protecting American jobs, reducing regulation, lowering taxes and cutting spending. The election itself was a surprise, and stock index futures look a deep dive into negative territory on Election Day before the market opening. But to the consternation of many observers, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 257 points November 9, and has reached record highs in the following months, trading above 20,000 for the first time.

Those policies are about to change. \nFund managers have been putting cash to work at the fastest pace since August 2009. The U.S. election result is “seen as unambiguously positive for nominal GDP,” writes Bank of America Merrill Lynch Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett. Investors are now also more optimistic about profit growth than they have been in 15 months. (For related reading, see: Understanding the Treasure Yield Curve Rates .) \nMeanwhile, interest rates on the benchmark 10-Year US Treasury have risen over 50% since mid-October, anticipating higher inflation and a rate increase by the Federal Reserve. At the same time, the political map of Europe is being upended as populist parties are gaining power in major countries. It remains to be seen what this means for European economies and the European Union. However, the vote on “ Brexit ” does not appear to have hurt the British economy as many opponents had predicted. \nThe U.S. market is reacting well to Trump’s plans for tax cuts and infrastructure spending. However, Trump’s threat to cancel a contract for a new Air Force One because of its high cost may signal a new frugality, something that appeals to populists who have long decried government waste. \nIt’s corporate tax reform that could be the key to a new economic stimulus. Lower corporate tax rates may induce American companies with foreign operations to repatriate an estimated $2.5 trillion in cash overseas. That could give a big boost to economic growth. Lower corporate rates can also incentivize foreign companies to set up plants in the U.S. \nMany of these programs are focused on reviving the economy that has supported the vast middle class we think of as the “average consumer.” Non-college educated workers have not had a raise in the last few decades. That was one reason for the popularity of Trump’s message to the middle class, the restoration of good paying, middle-class jobs. \nThey are going to be the focus of the new Trump administration and will determine the success or failure of the Trump economy.
