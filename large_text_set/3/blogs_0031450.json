Abdulraham Dambazau, the Minister of Interior, at the colloquium, which had the theme, “Make it In Nigeria: Use what we make, make what we use”. Muhammadu Buhari \nBuhari said that the theme of the colloquium was apt as it was a desirable and necessary policy for the country. \n“The government is serious in facilitating industries to make what we can locally and import only what is strategic to our development plans,” he said. \nBuhari said it was high time Nigeria looked inward to develop its economy. \nHe said the government was looking forward to receiving proposals from discussions at the colloquium, with a view to incorporating them into the economic policy. \nThe President described Tinubu, in whose honour the colloquium was organised, as an outstanding politician and great mobiliser, who was effective in conceiving and planning governmental policies. \nAlso, Gov. Akinwumi Ambode of Lagos State described Tinubu as a successful leader who had mentored many leaders in the country. \nAmbode likened Tinubu to a coconut which was blessed with a divine task to be fruitful and useful to humanity, versatile, courageous, and which could bear fruit for a long time. \n“If Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, were a coconut; I dare say, with all simplicity, I would be among the frontliners that will eat, drink and sleep B.A.T. 24/7,” Ambode said. \n“The test of a successful leader is in the number of leaders that he has created. Using this globally accepted parameter, Asiwaju, at 65, is without doubt, a winner in this category,” he said. \nNAN reports that the colloquium was organised in honour of Tinubu, who clocks 65 on Wednesday. \nDignitaries at the event included Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, former Vice President, Namadi Sambo, former and serving governors, Senators, politicians, entrepreneurs, among others.
