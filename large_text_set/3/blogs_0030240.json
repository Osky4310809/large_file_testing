Some of them contend anybody eligible for the types of free passage afforded the girls on Sunday is well aware of dress code restrictions, however silly they may seem from the outside. \nKristin Taylor, in tony Greenwich, Connecticut, is a leggings lover and sees them everywhere in her world. She’s also a psychologist and stay-at-home mom to two of three sons, “so no leggings for them.” She just flew in leggings to San Diego and wore a nice pair, from J.Crew, out to lunch recently with a cashmere tunic. \n“Leggings are pants,” she said. “Seriously.” Four young women wear US flag leggings (Photo by MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images) \nFleece-lined or paired with a fancy top for evening, leggings can be just about anything the wearer wants them to be these days, Taylor said. Besides, as the debate over leggings has gone on for years, what about jeggings? What about tights? Should today’s standard on “pants” rely on whether one can also comfortably perform a Downward Dog? \n“And for kids? I find that ridiculous,” Taylor added. \nThere was some initial confusion as to whether the girls were accompanied by a man in shorts, who was allowed to board the plane. United spokesman Jonathan Guerin said Monday the man in shorts was not with the girls, he was a paying customer. United doesn’t let men wear shorts while traveling on employee passes. The gate agent stopped the leggings-wearing girls because they were using passes. \n“The girls (teenagers) were completely understanding,” Guerin said. “No one was upset at the gate.” \nChicago-based United regularly reminds employees about the dress rules and tells them to make sure that anyone flying with one of their passes knows the guidelines, he said. Just the day before, United had sent a memo to airport workers reminding them of the dress policy, he said. The reminder “specifically mentioned leggings, along with other no-nos for travelers using United passes, such as flip-flops and torn jeans,” he said. \nHe said United isn’t contemplating any changes to the standards. \n“They were not designed to single out women or men,” Guerin said. “It has to do with the way we present ourselves and that represents the company and represents the brand.” \nTamara Rodriguez Trevino, of Dallas, Texas, is an elementary school teacher and wearer of LuLaRoe leggings. The airlines, she said, should be left to their policies for friends and family free travel. \n“After reading a few articles and comments about the situation, I feel that, although it may be discriminatory toward women and girls, the airlines have guidelines that have been in place for many years,” she said. “Because they foot the bill for the travel, I feel that they can enforce their policies when applicable. Now removing those said friends of family from the plane seemed excessive to me. Verbal warning should have been given maybe?” \nKim Bongiorno, in central New Jersey, has a 9-year-old daughter who is a leggings enthusiast and caught wind of the controversy on television news. The family travels on United often on frequent-flyer points. \n“Ever have to deal with the folds and bunches of jeans on a 5-hour flight, losing circulation and feeling the pinch in your waist when you become bloated?” she asked. “How about people with bad circulation who need to wear compression socks and legging-style pants or sweatpants? \nShould those who need them for health and comfort reasons be denied a seat on United? Only healthy, very slim, short people who wear jeans/trousers comfortably in cramped spaces are welcome?” \nBongiorno has more questions: What of the decorum of men in clingy trousers that can be revealing? How about men in tight shirts? Men in shirts with sexual sayings or images on them? \nGiovanna Bovenzi Cruz, a secretary and consumer services representative from Vineland, New Jersey, wears leggings. \n“I feel like the dress code is a little outdated,” she said. “I don’t know any woman or young girl that doesn’t wear leggings.” \nForest Graham, an American living in Rio de Janeiro, is married to a United flight attendant and often takes advantage of the standby family flying policy. He said he has been denied boarding in the past for wearing shorts and flip-flops. \n“But, frankly, I couldn’t care less,” he said. “I’d wear nothing but a pink thong if it meant I could travel anywhere for basically free.” ___ Associated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida, David Koenig in Dallas and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
