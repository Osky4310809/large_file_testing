My man! I actually agree with you on some stuff this week. \n1. That deer was seriously garbage cgi. In a show where they can make a decent looking tiger, why can’t they make a deer that looks better than Nintendo 64 graphics? Put that deer in the toilet. \n2. Thoroughly baffled by the Rosita thing for the same reason. She didn’t listen to Gabriel, she still tried to shoot Negan, and she just missed. That scene made me think I was forgetting something big. Maybe I was. \n3. Jaydis is fucking TERRIBLE. Her hair is stupid, her face is stupid, her whole schtick is stupid. I thought the stilted bizzarro world cult-speak was maybe just her thing, but then her little commander at arms said “Expect us?!” and I knew it was A Thing. This should not be A Thing. At least we know this disposable army of anonymous weirdos is all due to be slaughtered in the Negan war. They might as well be wearing literal red shirts. \n4. How is anyone still alive in this universe? They’re all so dumb. Rick and Michonne flipped out because there were no brakes in a car going 3 mph powered by pushing. And then Michonne jumps in the trunk for some reason. And then Rick falls out of a ferris wheel from what appeared to be the recoil of the handgun he’s shot his entire adult life. This whole crew is filled with morons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T18:36:27.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
