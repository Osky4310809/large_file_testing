What doesn’t come to mind? Seeing the entire cast of Friends. \nOn Off Camera with Sam Jones, Courteney Cox (who’s better known as Monica in the Friends osphere) talked about the first time the cast was flown to Las Vegas. She said it’s the first time they were conscious of exactly how different their lives would be from then on out. Namely, the fact that they probably wouldn’t be able to casually hit up a casino all together ever again.\nCourteney goes on to say that if they were all to go to a casino together now that she’d be shocked, but not for the reason you think. She says on the show,\n“I would probably be shocked because I’d be so happy because it would be so hard to arrange.” She explains that although the cast is still really close (the show was on the air for 10 years after all), that everyone meeting up isn’t always easy breezy. The women of the show, Jennifer Aniston as Rachel and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe, however, all manage to see each other pretty often. In fact, Courteney was seeing “the girls” that night.\nNBC/Getty Although we’re not sure what the ladies do when they hang out (coffee at Central Perk Café we hope), we’re sure its adorable and inspiring. Here’s to Friends and the friends that come along with it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:11:17.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
