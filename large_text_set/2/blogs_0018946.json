The Grammy-nominated emcee gave props to XXXTENTACION for his Billboard hit \"Look At Me.\" \nHe praised the Florida native for breaking musical barriers straight from the underground. Accused of six felony charges, X is currently sitting in jail, waiting for his trial. @xxxtentacion u breaking music barriers while they gotchu behind bars. That's amazing homie. See u in the free world soon playa. — lil boat kot* (@lilyachty) February 22, 2017 \nX didn't answer but that might be because of the constraints he deals with on a daily basis. When a Twitter user complained that he didn't see any music barrier being broken, King Boat was quick with the repartee. The barriers of being labeled a SoundCloud underground rapper but breaking 24 on billboard charts.. get off dick pussy https://t.co/x1cOq6Uc5N — lil boat kot* (@lilyachty) February 22, 2017 \nLil Yachty might seem fluffy and fun but the 19-year-old is no punk. X's \"Look At Me\" climbed to number 18 on Billboard rap song charts, up from last week where it was at number 24. Even more amazing, it notched number 74 on Hot 100. \nMeanwhile, Yachty's debut album Teenage Emotions is due out this year. He's also going on tour in Europe and will be performing at KOKO in London on February 24. For now, check out his new song with Pollari, \" Diamonds .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:34:58.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
