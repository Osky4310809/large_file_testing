News & Advice UK ban on laptops for Middle East flights set to cause airport chaos \nFollows imposition of ban on electronic devices aboard planes flying out of 10 airports in region to US  02   Travel Passengers traveling will be prohibited from bringing laptops, tablets and other portable electronic devices on board AFP/Getty Images \nUK airlines and their foreign counterparts in the Middle East and North Africa have been thrown into disarray by the announcement of an imminent ban on all electronic devices larger than mobile phones . \nThey will be prohibited on flights from certain airports to Britain, but it is not clear where exactly the prohibition will apply. \nIt follows the chaotic imposition of a ban on electronic devices from 10 airports in the region to the US . \nThe Department for Homeland Security prohibition began to emerge on Monday evening, with a prematurely sent tweet from Royal Jordanian Airlines. \nLater, the DHS said : “Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items. Read more Royal Jordanian Airlines suddenly bans electronic devices from cabins \n“It is prudent to enhance security, to include airport security procedures for passengers at certain last point of departure airports to the United States.” \nThe 10 affected airports are Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Casablanca, Doha, Dubai, Istanbul Ataturk, Jeddah, Kuwait and Riyadh. \nSecurity officials in Washington DC have shared the intelligence with their counterparts in London. \nIt is evidently regarded as credible, and the Government is to impose similar regulations on flights to British airports — which would affect far more passengers than the US ban. \nOn a typical day, from Dubai alone, Emirates dispatches six Airbus A380 “Superjumbo” aircraft to Heathrow, and a further three to Gatwick. \nBritish Airways, Qantas, Royal Brunei and Virgin Atlantic also fly from Dubai to Heathrow. UK to follow Trump's US ban on laptops for flights from Middle East \nManchester and Birmingham are each served three times a day by Emirates, with Glasgow receiving two arrivals and Newcastle one. \nEtihad and Qatar Airways, whose hubs at Abu Dhabi and Doha respectively are also covered by the American ban, also fly more frequently to the UK than to the US. \nIn addition, Turkish Airlines has a dozen flights on a typical day to London, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. \nThe US list of 10 “last point of departure” airports was easy to compile, because American officials simply looked at the routes from the “suspect” countries and imposed the ban on the source airports. \nUnder the UK's measure, all direct flights from six countries - Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia - will be affected.
