If needed, the car will brake automatically to avoid a collision up to a certain speed, or mitigate it at higher speeds. \nThe safety assessment programme’s test of autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems include the Car-to-Car rear-end tests (AEB City and AEB Interurban), as well as AEB Pedestrian tests (introduced in 2016). \nThe AEB Pedestrian tests involves three scenarios: an adult runs into the road from the driver side of the vehicle; an adult walks into the road from the passenger side of the vehicle (two tests are carried out for this scenario); and a child runs from between two parked cars into the road from the passenger side of the vehicle. \nBoth the S90 and V90 managed to excel in the tests, being the first sedan and estate to score a full six points, according to Euro NCAP. Additionally, the models surpass the best overall score of any model tested last year, and now make Euro NCAP’s top three best performing cars ever, all Volvos (including the XC90). \n“Volvo has invested in safety, has made key technologies standard across the model range and the results speak for themselves: a very impressive five-star rating,” said Michiel van Ratingen secretary general of Euro NCAP. \n“We work hard to ensure that our cars fulfil all safety requirements and pass all testing procedures that the ratings agencies develop. Our main focus is, and always has been, real-life safety. Autonomous emergency braking systems, such as our City Safety offer also represent a clear step forwards on our journey toward fully autonomous cars, which we see as a key element to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries,” said Malin Ekholm, director of the Volvo Car Safety Centre at Volvo Cars Group. \nGALLERY: Volvo S90 and V90 Research Volvo Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T10:42:39.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
