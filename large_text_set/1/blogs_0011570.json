I’ve had numerous conversations with Keith about the importance of organizing on the ground in 2017, rebuilding our party from the ground up, and harnessing the energy of grassroots Democrats. Keith’s desire to refocus the DNC on our local communities and local party organizations is exactly in line with what we plan to do in Michigan. That is why I am honored to support Keith Ellison. Not only is Keith a Detroit native that understands Michigan, he is an organizer that can unify our party and raise the resources to win in 2018 and beyond.” ###", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:54:32.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
