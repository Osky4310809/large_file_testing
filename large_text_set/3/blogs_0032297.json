It wasn't pretty, or even something to brag about, but getting results on the road in CONCACAF is not joke. The Americans got the job done and continued to make headway in their quest to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. \nWhich three players shone brightest for the U.S.? AP AP 1 Christian Pulisic \nOnce again, the kid was superb. His play to set up Clint Dempsey for the Americans' lone goal was tremendous, and being the difference maker in a match like this wasn't easy. Panama keyed on him, used constant fouls as their chief tactic to slow him down and the pitch was horrendous. Pulisic had no business being as good as he was, even if he was routinely frustrated and dealing with problems handed to him by Panama, the referee and the pitch. 2 Omar Gonzalez \nArguably the Americans' worst player last week against Honduras, Gonzalez was dominant against Panama. Bruce Arena showed faith in the central defender, running him back out there, and Gonzalez repaid that faith. He was excellent in the air, which was imperative against a team physical like Panama and on a bad pitch. He also read the game very well, stepping up to stop plays early when needed. AP AP 3 Tim Howard \nMost of the time Howard when was called upon, it was pretty simple for the goalkeeper. But there was one instance when Luis Tejada got in on goal and should have notched the winning goal for Panama. Howard had no business stopping Tejada, but that's what he did, and he managed to cover the ball too. It was incredible, and saved the U.S. a point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T16:16:50.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
