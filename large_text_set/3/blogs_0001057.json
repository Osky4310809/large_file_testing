[Photo/Xinhua] \nBEIJING - China's economy is expected to remain the strongest engine for world economic growth in 2017, a spokesperson of the top political advisory body said Thursday. \nChina's economy expanded by 6.7 percent last year, a good start for the country's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), Wang Guoqing, spokesperson for the fifth session of the 12th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said at a press conference. \n\"Both the quality and efficiency of China's economy saw further improvement last year,\" he said. \nAccording to data from the World Bank, China's 2016 growth would account for about a third of world growth, larger than the contribution from any other country. \nChina's steady growth creates greater demand, a wider variety of products and more cooperation opportunities, Wang said. \nThe fundamentals for China's long-term growth have not changed, and the economy still enjoys strong sources of growth, he added, citing remarks by national political advisors at a meeting earlier this year. \n\"Seeking progress while maintaining stability\" will be the main theme for China's economic work this year, according to a statement issued after the Central Economic Work Conference in December. \nWang added that China will seek new progress in the reform of important areas. \n\"We can be assured that China will not slow down its steps in deepening overall reforms, but make steadier strides,\" he said.
