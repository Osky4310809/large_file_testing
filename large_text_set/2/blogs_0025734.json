San Miguel jumped out to an early lead and never looked back in Game 2. Photo by PBA Images MANILA, Philippines - The San Miguel Beermen went 50% from beyond the arc and raced off to a hot 17-2 start as they kept the Barangay Ginebra at bay, 109-82, in Game 1 of the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup Finals on Friday, February 24 at the Mall of Asia Arena. The defending champs gained a double-digit cushion early on, stretching the lead on 56% shooting from the field at halftime. The Gin Kings, who were limited to 17-of-48 shooting with only a single triple made at the half, failed to spark a rally down the stretch. Game 2 of this finals series will take place in Lucena City on Sunday, February 26. Details to follow.
