soon as the New Year hits, Brits start to think about where to go on holiday in the next 12 months, whether it’s a cost-effective staycation or getting a tan in hotter climates. \nWe spoke to some of the UK’s best travel bloggers and asked them where they would recommend we travel in 2017, and why. We asked travel bloggers where we should go in 2017 Fez, Morocco \nTamason Gamble from Travellingbookjunkie said: “In 2017, if you have not yet made it to Morocco, this could be the year. \n“With an offering of various cities, beach locations and the desert, spending a week or so in this diverse country could lead to so many experiences. 13 You do not have to leave the UK to get fabulous beaches… Tenby is beautiful \n“Why not consider flying into Fez, which is less touristy than Marrakesh, meaning that you get a glimpse of Morocco that has not changed over the years. \n“From here you have several choices – the blue city of Chefchouen, the location and country made famous by Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca or why not head to the Sahara desert and camp under the stars?” The Game of Thrones trail, Northern Ireland \nIf you can’t wait for the new series of Game of Thrones, why not take up Joanne from Opposable Thumb’s advice and take a trip to Winterfell. 13 If you cant wait until the next series of Game of Thrones, you can go to Winterfell right now \nJoanne wrote: “HBO’s Game of Thrones has filmed in multiple locations all over Northern Ireland. As yet you can’t visit Titanic Studios, where indoor filming takes place – but many outdoor locations are open to the public and are free to visit. \n“The grounds of Castle Ward house the Whispering Wood and are the setting for key scenes in the show. \n“Probably the most beautiful place we visited was the enigmatic Dark Hedges, better known as The King’s Road.” Hull, UK \nIf you are looking for a bit of culture, according to Vanessa Charles from JibberJabberUK , you could do a lot worse than visiting Hull. \nShe said: “Has to be Hull, as today is the start of it being the UK’s City of Culture. \n“There are amazing events throughout the year from art to music and exhibitions – which starts with a ‘Made in Hull’ exhibition. ” For peace and quiet, Switzerland is ideal for 2017 Susten, Switzerland \nIf you have a head for heights and also being in the place with the best chocolate in the world, Ashleigh Dougherty from Beingashleigh.com recommended Susten. She said: “Switzerland is the place if you need to find yourself and crave some peace and quiet. \n“I recommend spending the afternoon up at the mountains near Susten, surrounded by forests and villages below in the Valais region.” Porto, Portugal \nLucinda Kate Hurst from Thefashionfictionary recommended a trip to Porto. She revealed: “When people think of Portugal, the go-to is often the capital city, Lisbon – but Porto is an incredible option and you can usually grab flights for two for under £100. 13 For some of the best food and people in the world, Porto is an ideal holiday spot \n“It’s a beautiful place, covered in iconic blue and white tiles. Cafes and listed buildings line the main streets, while downtown Porto is a ix of colourful rustic apartments and washing strung from every window. \n“The locals are friendly, familiar and only too happy to give you dinner recommendations.” Ubud, Bali 13 Bali is a place lots of bloggers recommended for 2017 \nTravel blogger Georgina Goodman from Georginadoes , told us that Ubud is the most cultural, romantic and magical place she had ever visited. Golden Bay, Malta \nRachel Spiteri from Beauty and the Bird said that she would recommend Malta for 2017. Rachel wrote: “It’s only a three hour flight from the UK, it’s pretty sunny all year around and lots of places have been featured in films and TV series including Game of Thrones, World War Z, Gladiator and The Da Vinci Code. Year-long hot weather and sea that blue – Malta is the perfect holiday destination A Mediterranean cruise \nIf you have never been on a cruise, maybe 2017 is the year to try it. Kara Guppy from Arewenearlythereyet told us how her and her family had a brilliant time on a Carnival Visa cruise. \nShe said: “We had an amazing time aboard the Carnival Vista in the Med in 2016 – perfect for exploring new countries, safe and fun for the kids and a holiday like no other. If you’ve got kids, cruises are more child friendly than you may think \n“We got to visit Barcelona, Rome, Pompeii, Pisa, Mallorca and the South of France.” RELATED STORIES TOP TIPS FOR TRIPS From Mallorca to the Atacama and even Cuba, top travel bosses reveal their insider tips on 2017's top holiday hotspots SCARE BNB From Iraq and Somalia to Afghanistan and Yemen, the scary Airbnb digs that can cost edgy travellers more than a four-star London hotel PLANE RIDICULOUS The most expensive family holiday ever?

Rhossili Bay and Tenby, South Wales \nJamie Edwards from explorewithted said: “West Wales has undoubtedly some of Britain’s best beaches, including the iconic Rhossili Bay and the secluded Barafundle bay. \n“Off peak you may enjoy a beach to yourself, but it’s perfect for a summer holiday with family. \n“Don’t forget to check out walking routes along the Wales Coast Path which connects the entire coastline of Wales and passes through pretty seaside towns like Tenby.” South Wales has the best beaches in the world – so why pay to go anywhere else? St. Malo, France \nIt maybe close, but it doesn’t mean you should write off France for a holiday. Zoe Holland from Jugglingonrollerskates said: “We travelled overnight by ferry to St Malo and explored the beaches of Brittany. \n“Ticks all the boxes for family adventure: easy travel on the ferry, fantastic onboard entertainment, long empty beaches, fresh seafood in St. Malo, sunshine and good value.” You can pop just across the water on a ferry to taste some of the best seafood in the world Indonesia \nSam Louise from Yokomeshi told us: “I would recommend Indonesia to see authentic South East Asia and the amazing variety of things you can do, from trekking active volcanoes, diving off remote islands and spotting Orangutans in the jungle.” Santorini, Greece \nAmi Pilkington from Ami-Rose said: “Absolutely loved Santorini. The island is only around 15 miles long so you can make sure you see the entire of it in your stay. \n“We hired quads for a day and managed to see everything. 13 The black sand beaches are never overcrowded in Santorini \n“You must see the sunset from Oia, we watched it from the castle and did a little shopping in Oia town. \n“The black sand beaches are stunning and not overcrowded whatsoever.” Kilimanjaro, Tanzania \nIf you’re feeling extra adventurous this 2017 – maybe it is time to finally climb that mountain. Ruth Bracegirdle from Prettylittlegymaddict told the Sun Online: “If you get the chance I would recommend travelling to Tanzania and climbing Kilimanjaro. \n“I know it’s a rather expensive trip but I came back a lot richer. It’s such a surreal experience, one I will never forget. If you are feeling adventurous, maybe 2017 is the year you climb a mountain \n“Meeting the locals and learning about their lives was fascinating – I was left stunned.” Antarctica \nIt’s not only penguins who visit the arctic – tourist go too. Katrina Howe from Twomonkeystravelgroup actually spent her honeymoon there. She said: “Antarctica for 2017 but you can only do it from January to March then November to December.” \nIt’s particularly difficult to get to, so one of the best ways to do it is on a cruise with a company such as Hurtigruten who will keep you safe and warm. 13 Take a cruise around the arctic and see some incredible wildlife \nOnce you’re abroad, here’s a cheeky little way to spot where be best rated attractions are in your area .
