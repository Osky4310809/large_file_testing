While he is considered one of the best actors in Bollywood by most people, a particular actress loves to comment on his Instagram photos. Nope, we’re not talking about Deepika Padukone , but popular Marathi film actress Amruta Khanvilkar . Amruta Khanvilkar \nApart from being a star in Marathi cinema, Amruta has also appeared in some Hindi movies like Phoonk and Himmatwala . She and her husband Himmanshoo A. Malhotra are also winners of the 7th season of Nach Baliye . Being a well-known celebrity herself, it’s rather endearing to see how open she is about her love for Ranveer! She can’t handle Rastafarian Ranveer! (but who can?) Instagram @ranveersingh His Durex commercial makes her blush <3 Instagram @ranveersingh Govinda seems to have no effect on her. Instagram @ranveersingh She can’t help it you guys!
