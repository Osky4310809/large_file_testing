Alfa. \nSenator Shehu Sani, chairman of the committee, had immediately after the letter was read on the floor debunked the claim, saying that the letter which also alleged that Lawal was not given fair hearing was full of lies. \nA copy of the committee report obtained by Vanguard yesterday showed that four other senators including the committee chairman, Senator Sani signed the report. The others who endorsed the report were Senators Ben Murray-Bruce, Tayo Alasoadura, and Mallam Ali Wakili. \nOnly three of the 10 members of the committee did not sign the report. They are Senators T.A. Orji, Oluremi Tinubu, and Mohammed Hassan. \nAsked if he signed the report or if his signature was forged on the report, Senator Murray-Bruce told Vanguard yesterday that he signed. “I signed,” the Bayelsa senator said in a text message to Vanguard. \nAlso responding, Senator Tayo Alaosadura, said, “I signed. The seven signatures are all genuine.” \nBuhari in his letter had said: \n“The review of the interim report shows that the interim report was only signed by only three out of the nine members namely Senator Solomon Adeola, senator Yahaya Abdullahi, and Senator Isaac M. Alfa \n“The signing of the interim report by three out of 9 members of the committee makes it a minority report of the Senate committee and not a committee report being an interim report. Thus, presenting a challenge for the presidency to determine the weight to attach to the report as currently presented. \nSenator Sani while responding had said: \n“I have a copy of the interim report which was initially signed by seven members of the nine members of that committee. Even if it is nine and then three people signed, we still have a quorum.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T13:28:52.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
