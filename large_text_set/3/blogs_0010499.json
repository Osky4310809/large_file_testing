Spiritual Growth and Encouragement for Christian Women Praying Through Your Pregnancy In Touch with Dr. Charles Stanley Encouragement for Today Daily Hope with Rick Warren SEE ALL DEVOTIONALS Tweet \nExpecting. Pregnant. With child. In the family way. A most exciting time! \nWith doctor's appointments, an expanding abdomen, ultrasounds, and baby showers, the focus of baby's development is dominated by her physical growth. But she is progressing more than that. Just as her body grows daily in your womb, so her spirit is learning from the Lord. \nWe all know the promises of Psalm 139 , but the Bible contains many more assurances for unborn children. Father is intricately involved in the development of your child. He is the giver of life, forming and protecting her. \nThe following is certainly not an exhaustive list, but comprises of scriptures that will encourage a pregnant mother. They demonstrate the God has his hand on your baby while she is in the womb. You might like to pray through these verses as you are pregnant and claim these promises. Whether you are mother-to-be, grandmother-to-be, Aunty-to-be, or happy friend, your prayers make a difference in her tiny life. \nThe Gift of Life \nSEE ALSO: Fighting Pregnancy Fears with Faith \nAfter all, God is the one who gave life to each of us before we were born ( Job 31:15 , CEV). \nGod is the giver of life. Life is not the result of chance. It is not an accident or fluke. Life comes about because God gives. He grants life to each baby before birth. Your baby has been filled with his life. \nCommissioned by Heaven \n\"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations” ( Jeremiah 1:5 NIV). \nSEE ALSO: Week By Week Time Lapse of Our Pregnancy || Those Crazy Shermans \nBaby has a destiny. More than that, she is commissioned by heaven. She is set apart to declare the Lord's plan to the nations. She is known by the Almighty and marked for him. She is chosen and loved. A pregnant woman does not carry just another baby, she carries one appointed by the Lord for greatness. \nFormed by the Lord in the Womb \nThis is what the Lord says—your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the Lord, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself ( Isaiah 44:24 NIV). \nFather sees baby in the womb. He listens to her heartbeat. He shapes her delicate parts and forms her perfectly. There is no need to worry about deformities or abnormalities. His hands gently mould her beautiful life, body and spirit. \nSEE ALSO: Pregnancy and Infant Loss: A Biblical Stance for Support \nWonderfully Complex \nHe makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love ( Ephesians 4:16 MSG). \nEvery part of baby's body fits together perfectly. All the intricate and complex parts, fashioned by God. Her whole body is healthy, growing, and full of love. I especially like that she is full of love. As her body is formed, God says that he is also filling her with love. More than anything, I want my children to be full of love. I don't know about you, but it is the most important part of growth to me. \nTaught of the Lord \nI will teach all your children, and they will enjoy great peace ( Isaiah 54:13 NLT). \nBut you desire honesty from the womb, teaching me wisdom even there ( Psalm 51:6 NLT). \nGod is the ultimate teacher. He teaches us our entire life, beginning in the womb. Father teaches babies wisdom even there. Though humans are born with a sinful nature, God gets a head start by teaching children his ways in the womb. Your baby is wise with the Lord's wisdom the minute she pops out. Wow! And a by product of learning from the Lord is great peace. Baby is peaceful. What mother does not want that? \nFilled with the Holy Spirit \nSEE ALSO: From Crisis to Joy: The Work of a Crisis Pregnancy Center Volunteer \nAt the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit ( Luke1:41 NLT). \nIf Elizabeth was filled with the Spirit, her womb was too. No wonder John was such a powerhouse, he was soaked in the Spirit before he was born. Just as the Spirit bathed John, your baby is surrounded immersed in the presence of God. The Holy Spirit is intimately acquainted with her already. How awesome! \nSheltered with His Wings \nThose who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty. This I declare about the Lord: he alone is my refuge, my place of safety; he is my God, and I trust him. For he will rescue you from every trap and protect you from deadly disease. He will cover you with his feathers. He will shelter you with his wings. His faithful promises are your armor and protection ( Psalm 91:1-4 NLT). \nLastly, baby is sheltered in the wings and feathers of the Lord. Baby is cradled in soft, beautiful feathers of protection. The womb is a safe place, a cocoon of protection. Protected from every deadly disease. Safe from harm. No wonder some babies never want to leave (well, at least my babies)! The womb is the ideal place for baby to flourish. Growing in stature, and growing in spirit, from the moment of conception. \nSarah Coleman is author of Expecting Daily Pregnancy Devotion and Make Yourself Amazing .
