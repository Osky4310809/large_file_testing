How cute? Superfriends references cute. Advertisement \nBuzzfeed has confirmed that Crazy Ex-Girlfriend star Rachel Bloom has lent her considerable talent to the Flash / Supergirl musical crossover, penning a duet between Melissa Benoist’s Kara and Grant Gustin’s Barry titled “Superfriends,” as an homage to the classic animated DC TV sensation. GIF \nAnd also the fact they’re adorable goofball superfriends on the show anyway. Here’s Bloom’s full statement, provided to Buzzfeed: Advertisement \nAs soon as I heard that they were doing a musical crossover, I e-mailed Mark Pedowitz who connected me to Greg and Andrew. I immediately offered them my services. As soon as they picked one of my song ideas, I hopped on the phone with my old Robot Chicken boss Tom Root and we brainstormed and, based on that brainstorm, I wrote up the song ‘Superfriends.’ I am so excited to contribute more to the upward trend that is musicals in television and film. Music can be one of the most amazing and efficient forms of storytelling and character development. Also, it was really fun to write a comedy song for two superheroes. \nEverything we’ve heard about this crossover is amazing and I can’t wait to hear more. The Flash / Supergirl crossover kicks off at the end of March 20’s episode of Supergirl , followed by “The Duet” on Flash the day after.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:13:23.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
