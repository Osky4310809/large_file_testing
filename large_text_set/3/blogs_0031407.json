Hang on, experts say.\nEnvironment Canada is warning Torontonians not to forget (or to underestimate) April’s penchant for cold.   \n“There have been very few Aprils without any snow in Toronto, so I would bet that we’re going to see some more snow,” he said.\nAccording to Phillips, last year’s snowiest month was actually April, which had almost 21 centimetres of snow in a winter that was less warm and snowier than normal.\nArticle Continued Below “We’re going to start (this) April off on a mild note…it’s going to feel like winter is long gone,” he said.\nHe followed up with a cautionary reminder: “But we had snow in May last year.”\nShare your thoughts Phillips said that removing snow tires is “probably a safe bet,” because while he expects we haven’t seen the last of the snow, it “could come one day and be gone the next hour.”\nThis back-and-forth of spring is part of what he calls April’s “personality,” which is tentatively warm, but unpredictable. \nHowever, as a rule, he said he doesn’t take off his own tires until after the 15 th of April.\n“We procrastinate on putting them on, I think we should procrastinate on taking them off,” he joked. “Why would we rush it when it’s not our human nature to do (so)?”\nHe suggested doing what one normally does; “Wait until late April or May and then think, ‘oh my gosh, I better take my snow tires off.’”\nThe Canadian Automotive Association agrees that it’s not yet time to take off the snow tires.\n“When temperatures hit 7C consistently…you can switch back to all season tires,” said Kaitlynn Furse, spokeswoman for the Canadian Automotive Association.\nSpecifically, Furse provides the same swap-date as Phillips.\n“At CAA, we suggest that people don’t change over tires before April 15th just to be safe,” said Furse.\nInsurance companies may vary when it comes to the recommended date on which to switch tires; the best practice is for drivers to check in with their specific company.\nFurse also recommended switching front and rear tires when swapping all-season tires back in; front tires typically take the brunt of the work, and rotating them will prevent uneven wear.\nTo the green thumbs out there, Phillips also notes that it is not yet time to dust off the gardening gloves – any seeds planted won’t grow, as the ground is still too cold to nurture life.\nWhile long-term models are predicting the next few weeks to be warm, individual days may vary, and the city is likely to see days and nights that are at or below freezing.\nThe consensus is clear; allow those winter tires a few more weeks of wear before giving your car a spring makeover.\nDelivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.
