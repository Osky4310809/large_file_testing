They’ve toured with Korn and Sum 41, and even formed their own record label called Uppity Cracker. They also have a song called “Faggot” . \nJimmy Urine is the lead singer of Mindless Self Indulgence. If you strain really hard, you may hear a slight vocal resemblance to Jack White of The White Stripes, Raconteurs, Dead Wheater, et al. However, for Urine, that’s enough to accuse White of “ripping off” Mindless Self Indulgence — whatever that means. \nHere’s the transcript of Urine’s rant from the band’s show at the Marquee Theatre in Phoenix on Friday night: \n“Hey Jack, how’s the new record that sounds just like me?

Listen to me, Jack: 1.) You have to get back together with Meg and start The White Stripes again, and 2.) You need to learn to stop giving a shit and love Mindless Self Indulgence, bitch. I don’t care if you ripped us off — just admit it. And scene. \nAnd here’s the video: Two real quick thoughts here: 1.) Urine does know White has already won a bunch of Grammys, right? So clearly he ripped off the right motherfucker. 2.) He seems genuinely sincere with his plea for a White Stripes reunion, which makes this whole thing all the more confusing. Anyways, if you’re interested, here’s what Mindless Self Indulgence sound like: Thanks to CoS reader Luis for the heads up… Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T07:58:54.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
