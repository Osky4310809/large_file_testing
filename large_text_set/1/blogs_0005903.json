As a bonus, the ad was shot in Greece and now I want to go to Greece. \nThe beginning of the ad looks like a movie segment more than anything else. It starts with a couple of ambiance shots and then you can see a grandmother hugging her grand daughter. I also feel like the yellow subtitles help you feel like you’re watching a movie. \nWith the close-up shot on the iPhone, you understand that you’re watching an iPhone ad and that we’re talking about the camera. Then you can see the same young woman taking a ton of portraits across Greece. Of course, all of them look great because Apple wants to convince you that the Portrait mode is great. \nThe Portrait mode was a late addition for the iPhone 7 Plus. While Apple announced the feature back in September , it was released as a beta feature with iOS 10.1 on October 24 . Apple is still improving the feature as it requires some complicated software calculations. \nThe Portrait mode is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus because it takes advantage of the two cameras in the device to detect 9 levels of depth. Then, the phone adds some software blur to the background layers. pr_stills-0005", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:16:15.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
