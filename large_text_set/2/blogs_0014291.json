(IE) \nTainted Samajwadi Party leader Gayatri Prajapati on Monday moved to Supreme Court against an earlier order which asked state police to register an FIR against him. The leader, while addressing a rally in Amethi, broke down and said that court will listen to him and do justice. The minister is currently facing allegations of rape and sexual harassment case. Prajapati was booked for rape and sexual harassment after intervention from the Supreme Court. The apex court also ordered a status of investigation in the cases. The Uttar Pradesh police has been given eight weeks time for the same. As per earier reports, a 35-year-old woman had complained against Prajapati alleging that Prajapati has raped her for the past two years. She further alleged Prajapati of taking obscene photos, and threatening to make them public. The state police was refusing to file any such report and therefore, the apex court ordered the FIR against Prajapati. Prajapati said that this was a BJP conspiracy against him and the truth will come out soon. But said that he respects SC’s decision.
