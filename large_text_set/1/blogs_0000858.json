So, this is something … a 14-year-old kid could have hacked Podesta that way.”\nAssange also said he was completely sure the emails did not come from Russia, despite information from U.S. intelligence officials that says Russian purposely interfered with the presidential election. The WikiLeaks founder said his source is neither the Russian government or a state party.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump quoted Assange’s teenager claim in a tweet and called the DNC “so careless.”\nJulian Assange said \"a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta\" – why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!\n— Donald J.
