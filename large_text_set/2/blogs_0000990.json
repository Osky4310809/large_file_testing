Posted 9 hours ago 5 \nAccording to a new report from the AJC , Styx drummer Todd Sucherman was sued by a fan name Lori Frederick, who allegedly suffered face injuries after the musician \"negligently threw a drumstick into the audience\" during the group's show in Georgia back in June 2015. \nThe suit alleges that Sucherman failed to give a \"timely and proper warning to allow Frederick to fully protect herself from injury.\" \nThe source reports: \"As a result, it says Frederick lost the benefit of the concert tickets, her clothing was 'rendered useless' by the blood from her injury and she was unable to register for the AJC Peachtree Road Race in July. \n\"She seeks to recover damages including medical expenses and lost income. Also named in the filing is Delaware-based TMB Productions, which 'owned, operated or managed the band Styx in its musical performances' during the June 2015 incident.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:52:51.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
