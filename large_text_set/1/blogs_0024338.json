No Democrats supported a complete repeal. \nThe overall 15 percent of doctors favoring repeal is lower than the 26 percent of the general public that feels the same, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. \n“Primary care physicians are on the front lines of health care — they are physicians that patients know best and turn to first when they are sick,” said Pollack. \n“With primary care physicians often helping patients navigate challenges with their insurance, it is critical to understand their perspectives on the repeal of the act.” \nMost doctors expressed support for parts of the law that have increased health insurance coverage, adding some 20 million people who previously did not have health care. \nA total of 95 percent said they support a ban on denying coverage or charging higher prices on the basis of pre-existing conditions. \nAnother 88 percent supported allowing young adults to remain on their parents’ plan until age 26. A large majority of doctors also favored tax credits and subsidies to small businesses and individuals. \n“We don’t yet know what provisions may be repealed or modified, but we have started to see signs of what could be coming,” said co-author David Grande, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. \n“And what has been absent in the conversation so far is how physicians feel the law has impacted their patients’ and the care they are able to deliver.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T18:27:24.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
