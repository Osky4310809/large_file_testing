Image credit – Handy Abovergleich \nAccording to Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen and Company , Apple will launch three iPhone models this year. One of those variants will sport a wraparound 5.8-inch OLED screen. The wraparound display would mean that the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, earpiece, infrared sensor and front camera module of the device will be embedded into the display itself. It will allow the handset to offer a seamless edge-to-edge display experience. \nArcuri also predicts that the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 model will get Synaptec’s optical-based fingerprint sensor instead of the regular Touch ID sensor. He also expects that Apple will add some sort of facial and gesture recognition to the iPhone 8. The device will offer wireless charging as well. \nThe rumour-mill suggests that Apple will utilise stainless steel casing for the iPhone 8, with the metal frame holding together a glass sandwich design, similar to the iPhone 4. The brand is expected to launch the new iPhones in September, so we expect to get plenty of additional details in the coming months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T15:33:55.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
