By: FE Online | Published: March 17, 2017 2:20 PM Rejecting the warrant, the 61-year-old judge today said, “We will go according to the law… I am processing legal weapons.” (PTI) \nIn a first ever, around the big cops led by the chief of the West Bengal Police arrived at Calcutta High Court judge Justice CS Karnan’s home in Kolkata today to serve a warrant ordered by the Supreme Court in a contempt case. Last week, the apex court had asked the Bengal police chief to “personally” serve the warrant to the High Court judge, a first in the country’s judicial history, after he skipped hearing in a contempt case. But the 61-year-old, in an unprecedented move, called a “court” on the lawns of his home on the same day and ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate the seven Supreme Court judges who had issued a contempt notice against him. \nRejecting the warrant, the 61-year-old judge today said, “We will go according to the law… I am processing legal weapons.” This warrant was in view of the fact that a sitting Calcutta High Court Judge has in a letter addressed to seven senior most judges demanded a compensation of 14 crore for disturbing his mind and normal life. Justice Karnan in his two-page letter to the seven judges said, “You have constituted an unconstitutional bench after breaking the Indian constitutional law and passed a suo motu contempt order and restrained me from judicial and administrative work and that order was passed with malafide intention in order to harass a Dalit Judge (myself).” \n“Judge means a dignified person of law who has to hear both sides of the case and pass order in accordance with law. Hence, I request you (CJI and other six judges) to cancel the unconstitutional bench and restore my normal work. The seven judges should pay compensation, a sum of ? 14 crores since you have disturbed my mind and my normal life, besides you have insulted me in the general public consisting of a population of 120 crore in India due to lack of legal knowledge,” the letter added. \nAlso Watch: \nIn his letter, he alleged that these senior judges have issued the order to protect the 20 judges against whom he has filed a complaint for dishonesty. Justice Karnan who had filed a defamation case against the seven Supreme Court judges who have ordered him to appear in court on March 31, has alleged that he is being targeted because he is a Dalit. “All seven judges have to resign and should be prosecuted,” the judge had declared last week, also urging the President of India to cancel the Supreme Court’s warrant against him. Some 20 Madras High Court judges had signed a petition against Justice Karnan, accusing him of high-handed behaviour.
