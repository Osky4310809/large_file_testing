Zuckerberg is slated as the featured speaker at the university's 366th commencement in May. \nCommencement speakers are often presented with honorary degrees from the universities that have invited them to speak. \nZuckerberg originally enrolled in Harvard as a member of the class of 2006, but never obtained an undergraduate degree after moving to Palo Alto, California to focus on Facebook. \nThe Ivy League college posted a cheeky video on Twitter where Zuckerberg asks fellow Harvard dropout and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates for advice. \nZuckerberg asks Gates, \"They know we didn't actually graduate, right?\" \n\"Oh, that is the best part! They actually give you a degree!,\" Gates said. \nThat's just one more thing Facebook's CEO can add to his resume.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:46:48.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
