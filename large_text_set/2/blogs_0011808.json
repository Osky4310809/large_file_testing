But if there is one thing we know about her, it's that she doesn't play when it comes to her sister. <img src=\"http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Solange-PF.jpeg\" alt=\"Solange Grammys\" width=\"1068\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-785646 size-full\" /> Despite having nine Grammy nominations for all of the greatness that is <em>Lemonade</em>, Beyoncé took home just best urban contemporary album and best music video for \"Formation.\" Even Adele knew that something fishy was in the water, as she <a href=\"http://madamenoire.com/785529/theres-no-problem-with-adele-calling-out-her-black-friends-in-celebration-of-beyonce/\" target=\"_blank\">used her album of the year speech</a> to laud Bey's most recent body of work. After having some time to think about it (earlier she said that her own acceptance speech would have been a reminder that Black women \"are Grammys mothaf--kaaaa\"), Solange shared a few tweets that have since been deleted. One said, \"there have only been two black winners in the last 20 years for album of the year,\" and \"there have been over 200 black artist [sic] who have performed.\" The other read,\"create your own committees, build your own institutions, give your friends awards, award yourself, and be the gold you wanna hold my g's.\" <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">sad Solange deleted her apt Grammys criticism but here it is again: \"create your own commitees... award yourself.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/Dqm3cu6D83\">pic.twitter.com/Dqm3cu6D83</a></p> — Jill Krajewski (@JillKrajewski) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JillKrajewski/status/831280118253359105\">February 13, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> Solange also shared (before also deleting) Frank Ocean's thoughts on what he called a \"cultural bias\" the Grammys exhibits. He shared a <a href=\"http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/157125310721/ok-ken-and-david-as-much-as-i-hate-to-make-you\" target=\"_blank\">full note on Tumblr</a> over the weekend after Grammy producers <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grammy-producers-respond-to-frank-ocean-criticism-w466347\" target=\"_blank\">talked about his \"faulty\" 2013 Grammy performance</a> and tried to say that is the reason he's not interested in attending the event these days. He didn't submit <em>Blonde </em>for Grammy consideration on purpose, explaining why he no longer has interest in the ceremony/event (it has to do with Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar): \"I've actually been tuning into CBS around this time of year for a while to see who gets the top honor and you know what's really not 'great TV' guys? <em>1989</em> getting album of the year over <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>,\" Ocean wrote in part of the note. \"Hands down one of the most 'faulty' TV moments I've seen. Believe the people. Believe the ones who'd rather watch select performances from your program on YouTube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. Use the old gramophone to actually listen, bro, I'm one of the best alive. And if you're up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I'm all for it.\" <em>What do you think of both artists' issues with the Grammys? </em> <em>Image via WENN </em>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:43:22.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
