We’ve been sad, but we’ve also been celebrating the lives and careers of these two amazing women. HBO has given us another way to do that, with a documentary about their relationship, and even though Carrie is gone, we know how she felt about Bright Lights .\nFisher Stevens, who co-directed the documentary about Fisher and Reynolds with Alexis Bloom, told E! News that both women saw the documentary before they died. Bright Lights aims to show the pair’s relationship, both good and bad.\nSaid Stevens of Fisher’s response: “… she was a little shocked at the intimacy of it.” However, with the help of some friends, Carrie Fisher came to appreciate the documentary. “There were little things that really bugged her, but in the end she fell in love with the film and thought it was a love letter to her and her mother, and that’s the good news, that she loved it,” Stevens said.\nIn Bright Lights , viewers get a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of both Fisher and her mother. Viewers see events such as Reynolds accepting the SAG Life Achievement award in 2015. Additionally, the documentary follows Fisher as she prepares for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. \nFisher shared an anecdote from that time with E!: “She does this workout to trim down for Princes Leia and she finishes the workout and lights a cigarette and drinks a Coca-Cola, and the trainer’s like, ‘Carrie, no!’ and grabs the Coke and pours it out. The next thing you see her assistant putting Coca-Colas in the refrigerator. That was Carrie, a real original.” \nHowever, the real central theme of Bright Lights is the love between Carrie Fisher and her mother. As evidenced by everything from Reynold’s statement after her daughter’s death, to the fact that they died so close together, the pair loved each other fiercely. Bright Lights premieres on HBO Saturday, January 7th, and we can’t wait to see it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:33:06.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
