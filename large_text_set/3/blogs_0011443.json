PUBLISHED: 15:37,  51, Mon, Mar 13, 2017 Sky News Nicola Sturgeon was pushed into a second indy ref by Alex Salmond, it is believed \nThe Scottish First Minister is believed to not even want the referendum she today announced she will launch, with a vote likely to be held between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. \nShe also does not believe she can win it, sources told Sky News. \nThey added the SNP leader was pushed into holding a second independence referendum by her predecessor Mr Salmond, who today tweeted his congratulations to Ms Sturgeon. \nHe said: “Well done Scotland’s First Minister. It’s called political leadership - UK parties should take note.” \nThe allegations will come as a surprise to the rest of the Westminster establishment who have been battling against Ms Sturgeon's threat of another independence referendum since the UK voted to leave the European Union last June. \nThe leaders of the Scottish Labour Party and the Scottish Conservative Party condemned the First Minister's decision to hold a second referendum, after Scots voted against leave the rest of the UK in 2014. \nRuth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, said Ms Sturgeon had \"chosen the path of further division and uncertainty\". \nKezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said \"Scotland is already divided enough\".
