By Matthew Nussbaum and Josh Dawsey 03/09/17 07:20 PM EST \nPresident Donald Trump has shown a willingness to cast off the routine elements of his job that his predecessors used to stay in touch with voters. | Getty Print \nPresident Donald Trump is sticking to his comfort zone. \nTrump has spent each of the 48 nights of his presidency either at the White House or at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. He has dined out in the nation’s capital just once — and that was a trip to his own Trump International Hotel for well-done steak. Story Continued Below \nAside from visits to a Florida elementary school and a Boeing plant — both en route to weekend breaks at Mar-a-Lago — he’s stayed within the presidential bubble even when venturing beyond Washington, visiting military installations and speaking at a large campaign-style rally. \nTrump has shown a willingness to cast off the routine elements of his job — the baby-kissing and glad-handing that his predecessors used to stay in touch with voters. Instead, he relies on Twitter as his megaphone — and on cable television to give him a daily sense of what the public is thinking. \nAides say they don't expect Trump to do much retail politicking — he doesn't love shaking hands — but will keep doing large rallies, including one scheduled for next week in Nashville. The rallies were part of his campaign routine that he loved because he was energized by large crowds. On foreign trips, one administration official said, his staff expect him to schedule “just as much time as he needs to be there.” By Isaac Arnsdorf and Darren Samuelsohn \nTrump is expected to make several appearances across the country next week — but he is likely to head back to Washington at night. \nHis habits in the White House so far comport with what friends in New York say about his pre-political life. He has long been a creature of comfort, eschewing some of New York's glitzy balls and galas to instead stay at home, watch TV and dine in his apartment, while watching sports and calling friends. After winning the presidency, he largely stayed in his apartment or at Mar-a-Lago, venturing out once in New York to the 21 Club for dinner. He is happy to not go outside. \n“He's not a guy who likes to be away from his own bed,” said Chrisr Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend and the CEO of Newsmax, who visited Trump recently at the White House. “He doesn't want to tour or travel for the sake of traveling. If he can get in a round of golf in Scotland, he'll do that. But you're not going to see him just spend three days shopping and visiting friends.” \nOn Tuesday, when public White House tours resumed for the first time since Trump took office, the president surprised a group of schoolchildren by hopping out from behind a screen to greet them. But other than that, he’s spent much of his time with people he already knows. He’s hosted CEOs and other executives at the White House at least 11 times in his 2½- month-old presidency. He’s huddled with the leaders of America’s automotive, pharmaceutical, retail, health insurance, financial and airline giants. Sitting around a large boardroom, while quizzing others round-robin, is a scene he is comfortable with and feels he can control. \nPart of Trump’s seeming distance from the real world may simply be the result of comparison to recent history and Trump's top aides. According to Washingtonian , President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama went to at least 80 D.C. area restaurants during their time in the White House, a record for the modern era. They also made a habit of visiting local bookstores and haunts like Ben’s Chili Bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:53:18.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
