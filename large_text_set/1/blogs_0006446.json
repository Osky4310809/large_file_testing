Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \nThe Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas Inc. (LVPI) will make sure that Alyssa Valdez is “protected” before she embarks on a 75-day tour of duty for 3BB Nakhornnont in the Thailand League. \nLVPI president Joey Romasanta said they have already received a formal letter from the club and the country’s volleyball governing body will scrutinize everything that’s included in the contract. \nFrom Jan. 15 to March 31, Valdez will play for the Thai club in the regular league. The club will shoulder everything—from her plane ticket down to her compensation package, which they didn’t divulge. ADVERTISEMENT \n3BB Nakhornnont manager Parawee Hoisang requested the transfer to the LVPI in a deal Romasanta described as “sending your daughter to college.” \n“I want to talk to her first,” said Romasanta. “I want to make sure that she would be protected and that everything would be aboveboard. It’s like a father sending his daughter to college. I want to make sure that she will be all right and wish her luck in her new endeavor.” \nStill, Romasanta said Valdez’s journey is a big boost for Philippine volleyball, which has grown a lot the past few years. \n“But rest assured that we would allow her. This is a glorious moment for the Filipinos and Alyssa would serve as our torchbearer there (Thailand),” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T19:10:37.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
