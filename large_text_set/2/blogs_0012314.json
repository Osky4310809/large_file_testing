Prince Charles and Camilla in Brixton today (Chris Jackson/Getty Images) \nFounded in 1981, by a collective of educationalists, community leaders, and parents, spearheaded by the late Len Garrison, Black Cultural Archives began as a community organisation. \nOver the next two decades, Black Cultural Archives amassed its legacy collection and developed a professional archive, library and object collection. \nWith so many other initiatives that you are pursuing, I was so impressed to hear about them and the fact that you are attracting so many people to this centre. \nPrince Charles added, \"I believe 50,000 and I'm sure it will grow and grow. In fact I can see a time come when even these premises will probably be too small. \n\"I just want to use this opportunity to attract those who have struggled so hard for so long to achieve this centre. I can imagine how difficult it has been. It is a great day that you have managed that.\" \nIn July 2014 the Black Cultural Archives opened the first national Black heritage centre in the U.K. dedicated to collecting, preserving and celebrating the histories of Black people in Britain. The B.C.A. heritage centre is located on Windrush Square, in the heart of Brixton - named after the Empire Windrush, which docked in Tilbury in 1948 carrying her passengers on their pioneering journey from Jamaica to Britain. \nThe bulk of the collection is drawn from the twentieth century to the present day, while some materials date as far back as the second century. \nThe collection includes personal papers, organisational records, rare books and photographs.
