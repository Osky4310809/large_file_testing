Together, these solutions could potentially handle the increasing energy demands created by a growing population on a planet with limited resources and an increasingly destabilized atmosphere . \nAl-Ghaili's suggests that the creation of macroalgae farms, tidal energy converters, and strategically placed solar panels could satisfy all of humanity's energy demands, and possibly reverse some of the effects wrought by climate change by removing excess carbon dioxide from the Earth's atmosphere. \nFirst take a look at the video below, then scroll down to see how at least one of his suggestions could become a reality in the future. Scientists at UC Berkeley have developed a \"wave carpet\" to harness the ocean's power. \nvia GIPHY \nNoting that \"world-wide demand for electricity is expected to double within the next 20 years,\" engineers at Berkeley's Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (TAF Lab) are working to develop a Wave Energy Converter that would harness the power generated by tides as a renewable energy source. \nAccording to UCB's Tumblr, the \"wave carpet,\" as it is known, \"is submerged underwater and adopts the wave motion of the ocean. The motion then moves the attached pumps to produce hydraulic pressure that can be converted into power.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:30:19.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
