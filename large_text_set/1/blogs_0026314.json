Perhaps it’s easy to dismiss being submerged when you’re not the one desperate for air, but for him, it was undeniably terrifying. And it’s not just the on-set cruelty: PETA’s recent exposé of Birds & Animals Unlimited — the reported animal supplier for the movie — revealed that animals were denied veterinary care, forced to sleep outdoors in the cold without bedding, kept in filthy conditions and deprived of food as a training technique. \nThere is no humane way to force animals to perform for film and TV. Caring people will avoid such productions. \nLisa Lange, PETA; Norfolk, Va. Policing the USA \nFacebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nI absolutely believe in the humane treatment of animals, and from what I can gather, this movie production has been predominantly compliant. \nHowever, any time I ever see a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals protest, I’m suspicious. The group’s agenda is super extremist and punitive, rather than informative and helpful. Its members pretty much act like self-righteous thugs, and any question to their credibility has come by their own hands. I appreciate their message, but not their delivery. \n— Michael Anthony Shea \nIf you wouldn’t film a movie that would do the same “stunt” with a child because it would be considered too dangerous and abusive, then you can safely say you wouldn’t do it to a vulnerable animal either. \nNo way anyone could enjoy a movie like this knowing it completely ignored the terror inflicted on Hercules. Unbelievable the cold, callous money-grubbing people who participated in this movie. \n— Joe Bloe  //usat.ly/2kux2Hf  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:25:17.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
