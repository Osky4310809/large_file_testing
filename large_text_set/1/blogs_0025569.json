Instead of them to say ‘if you challenge Obiano in the election, you pay N9m’, they are talking this rubbish. \n“All aspirants must be given unfettered opportunity in the contest; nobody will be allowed to set unconscionable conditions in the race. \n“Anambra State Government is not INEC that sets guidelines in election. The constitution is the supreme law of the land and nobody can change it with domestic and obnoxious laws.” \nEmecheta added that a public enlightenment on the modalities for putting up election posters would begin in February, which he explained, would let politicians know that they would not be allowed to paste election posters on public buildings, electric poles, bridges, road dividers and roundabouts. \nHe said the agency would direct politicians and their supporters to where to paste election materials. \nThe ANSAA boss said, “It’s a quasi-criminal offence for any person not to pay government revenue. Any politician, who fails to pay their bills before making campaign posters public, would have the agency to contend with in the court of law. \n“So, we are telling politicians ‘don’t say Willie Obiano is pursuing you or APGA is chasing you around’. Do the needful to avoid prosecution.” \nHe directed politicians, who wished to put up billboards, to go through registered advertising agencies in the state, noting that no poster or election material of the incumbent governor would be pasted without payment. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:22:47.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
