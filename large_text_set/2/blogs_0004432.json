has some kind of divine right quite seriously,' chief executive of Republic says Alastair Grant - WPA Pool/Getty Images \nRepublicans are calling for the Queen to abdicate as she becomes the first British monarch to celebrate 65 years on the throne. \nElizabeth II's Sapphire Jubilee is being marked with cannon salutes in London's Green Park and at the Tower of London. \nBut having celebrated her 90th birthday last year and suffered a heavy cold over Christmas that caused her to miss church, questions are being raised as to how long she can continue in her role as head of state. New portrait of the Queen unveiled for her Sapphire Jubilee \n\"It would be unsurprising if someone at her wage wouldn't be able to do a full time job of being head of state,\" Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic , told The Independent . \n\"So it's very reasonable to expect her to step down and retire an then let the people decide who was going to replace her.\" \nHowever, Mr Smith said it was unlikely the Queen would choose to abdicate. \n\"It would completely go against everybody's understanding of her view of the role,\" he said. \"She takes the notion she has some kind of divine right quite seriously. \n\"It's been reported throughout her reign that she's opposed to abdication.\" Queen Elizabeth II: Life in pictures Queen Elizabeth II: Life in pictures 1/50 Queen Elizabeth II \nQueen Elizabeth II on a walk-about in Portsmouth during her Silver Jubilee tour of Great Britain, 1977 2/50 Queen Elizabeth II \nThe future Britain's Queen Elizabeth II (R) pictured with her younger sister Princess Margaret (L) in 1933 AFP/Getty Images) 3/50 Queen Elizabeth II \nThe 9-year-old Elizabeth attends an aristocratic wedding with her mother and younger sister.
