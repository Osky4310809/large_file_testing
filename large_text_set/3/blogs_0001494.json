Not only did she step out on the red carpet looking absolutely beautiful, but she took on the role of hosting the Animal Hope & Wellness Foundation’s gala event . And as always, Doherty maintained her unwavering positivity when talking about her journey with cancer. “I feel great. I mean, I feel good, I’m super-positive, I’m happy with where I’m at right now. Cancer, for me, as hard as it is, has been a blessing. It has changed who I am as a human being forever. It’s altered my life in ways I can’t even speak of,” she told Us Weekly .\nRodin Eckenroth/Getty Images Her speech was equally fierce, and we she even shared what has helped get her through her darkest times.\n“Cancer can be isolating and depressing, can be all-consuming. Cancer can overwhelm your life. Seeing animals being rescued touched my heart and they renew my determination to dig deep and continue my own personal fight. I wonder how I would fare faced with such death and cruelty. … [Animals] encouraged me to face adversity with the same strength and grace that they display in the face of destruction.” A post shared by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Feb 14, 2017 at 9:02pm PST \nHere she is at the event with her hubby Kurt Iswarienko. Together, they emit all the good vibes.\nTonight @animalhopeandwellness full house and with my love @kurtiswarienko #ahwfgala \nA post shared by ShannenDoherty (@theshando) on Mar 4, 2017 at 8:46pm PST \nWithout question, Shannen Doherty is one badass cancer slayer .
