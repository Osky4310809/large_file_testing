But even their shoes, and shoelaces, were the same. media_camera Australia's Daria Gavrilova is congratulated by Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky. Even the photographer believed Dasha was on the left and not the right in this photo — no joke. \nWhile this may seem a bit light for some, it was an issue for many viewers who couldn’t at a glance tell which player was which. \nThe hilarious fashion faux pas reminded many fans on social media of the recent Channel Nine incident wherein a journalist was upset at another for wearing the same colour and not putting on a jacket. \nBut what made it even more strange was that this wasn’t the first time Gavrilova has had the same problem. \nEarlier this January at the Hopman Cup, Gavrilova defeated American Coco Vandeweghe — with both women wearing the same two-toned blue outfit. media_camera Hopman Cup 2017 — Dasha returns to... media_camera ...Vandeweghe. We think. (Photos by Paul Kane/Getty Images) \nAnd the year before that at the same event, Gavrilova and opponent Sabine Lisicki were also hard to split. It wasn’t the same outfit — they were wearing two different brands — but you could’ve fooled most people. media_camera Hopman Cup 2016 — Sabine Lisicki returns a serve from... media_camera ...her mirror mode opponent, Dasha. (Photos: Daniel Wilkins) \nThere are probably other, more important things for the tennis higher-ups to deal with most days. But we’re just saying — it’s a bit odd. \n...AND I GET UP AGAIN \nTENNIS isn’t usually a contact sport — particularly for non-participants. \nBut a ball kid found out the hard way that sometimes it is during the all-Spanish clash between 13th seed Roberto Bautista Agut and 21st seed David Ferrer on Saturday. \nBautista Agut went all out for a ball and ended up storming towards the umpires’ chair — so quickly that the ball kid standing next to it didn’t have time to get out of the way.
