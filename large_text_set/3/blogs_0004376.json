He was on his way to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\nBut after the photos surfaced online, some people couldn't help but notice what was missing from President Trump's left hand: a wedding ring.\n\nThe observation comes a month after US Weekly magazine reported that Melania was \"miserable\" as first lady, due to the constant media attention and expectations that come with the position.\nMelania has also yet to move into the White House. She remains in Trump Tower in New York City. The official reasoning behind her stay in New York is to have her and Donald Trump's 10-year-old son Barron finish the school year.\nIt is unclear if Melania joined her husband at Mar-a-Lago this past weekend, as she has done in the past.\nReactions among social media users were split. Some viewed the observations as yet another attack on President Trump by the media, while others dismissed them as \"fake news.\"\n\"SO WHAT I have been married 26 years and I don't always wear mine,\" wrote one commenter. \"The constant assault on Trump is going old. He is our president, he is doing a great job, get off his back!\"\n\"Oh for the love of God, lay off Trump,\" wrote another. \"Bill Clinton wore a wedding ring but was busy having affairs for forty years. So very very glad I don't live in the cuckoo state of California.\"\n\"It is not news at all; it's just musings by the writer,\" admitted another commenter. \"However, it isn't fake, either. It would be fake if it said he didn't wear a wedding band, when he actually did.\n\"He doesn't wear one, so it isn't fake, it's true. Very odd that some people call things that are clearly true, 'fake.'\n\"You probably call things that are false, 'true' and 'telling it like it is.' We live in opposite world, ever since Trump first became the nominee, and it has only gotten worse since he took over in January.\"\nThis isn't the first time President Trump has been seen not wearing a wedding ring. He reportedly never wore a wedding band when he was married to his first wife, Ivana Zelnickova, and may have occasionally wore one during his second marriage to Maria Maples, according to Mercury News.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T18:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:58:05.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
