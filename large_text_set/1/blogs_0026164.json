Image copyright Welsh Government \nEducation Secretary Kirsty Williams said: \"This system is not about grading, labelling or creating crude league tables but about providing support and encouraging improvement in our schools. \n\"It is about putting schools into a position that helps them to identify areas they can strengthen and what they need to do achieve further improvements.\" \nShe said 84.4% of primary and 64.6% of secondary schools were now in the green and yellow categories. \n\"This increase is to be welcomed, as these schools will have a key role to play in supporting other schools, sharing their skills, expertise, and good practice,\" Ms Williams added. \nThey follow on from education watchdog Estyn's annual report last week which found seven out of 10 primary schools were \"good or better\" but only four out of 10 of the secondary schools it inspected. \nTeaching unions have generally given a cautious welcome to the system, providing it is only part of wider methods of evaluating schools. \nRob Williams, director of policy at head teachers' union NAHT Cymru, said: \"We still believe that for categorisation to work at its best, it needs to be part of a co-ordinated school improvement system in Wales.\" \nHe added: \"As Estyn highlighted in their recent annual report, variability still exists across Wales and the additional focus on schools in the amber and red categories does not mask the huge funding disparities that continue to exist between schools. \n\"We know that the Welsh Government is listening to school leaders and their concerns about a system that uses single cohorts of pupil data in isolation, with no inclusion of the progress those individual pupils make whilst in a school.\" \nThe National School Categorisation System is agreed between local education authorities and Welsh Government and includes performance measures and self-evaluation by schools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:02:58.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
