Three decades on, the 80s anthem Send Me an Angel is still being endlessly covered, remixed and piped through shopping centre speakers. And chances are you know it by heart, even if you don’t know you know it. \nMaybe you heard it on the radio (then or now), or during a montage in a formative 80s movie like Teen Wolf Too , The Wizard or the BMX-bike fantasy Rad . It’s been streamed more than 10m times on YouTube alone, but often overlooked is the fact that this new wave staple is Australian. Sam Sparro: George Michael has been done an injustice. We need to keep sharing his stories Read more \nYes, the young Melbourne band Real Life scored a dream calling-card with the lead single from their 1983 debut album, Heartland. The song went to number one in Germany and New Zealand, came close in Australia and cracked the US top 40. And with good reason: between its instantly recognisable synth hook and swooning chorus, haloed with sing-along harmonies, Send Me an Angel is a stone-cold earworm from the golden age of fist-pumping synth-pop. \nAs for its Aussie pedigree, singer/guitarist David Sterry positions Real Life on a loose timeline of Antipodean new wave between forebears like Models and Icehouse and disciples like Pseudo Echo and Kids in the Kitchen. “[The] early 80s was a great time for us,” he tells Guardian Australia. “We used to open for INXS , Mi-Sex, the Church, Midnight Oil and many others. It was a great apprenticeship.” \nSo why don’t people realise the song is from Australia? Partly that’s down to Sterry’s lean and hungry singing, which doesn’t betray his native accent. But Real Life actually made a conscious decision to stand apart from other Aussie exports. \n“In Europe and the USA at the time, it seemed like Aussie bands, films and books were the flavour of the month,” Sterry says. “When we made the first video, we were determined not to look like your average Aussie pub band in jeans and T-shirts … We very much embraced the androgyny of the New Wave scene and wanted to present ourselves in a theatrical way, as overseas performers did.” \nThe song might have remained just a fleeting success, if not for a tighter and harder-hitting 1989 remix from English producer Nigel Wright, best known today as Andrew Lloyd Webber ’ s longtime music producer. Despite coming near the end of that synth-mad decade, the latter version did even better in the US, especially on club charts, and sealed the song’s stubborn staying power. \n“It started to take off all over again, to everybody’s surprise,” Sterry recalls. He points to the disparate cover versions that have sustained the song’s afterlife ever since, from rockabilly and punk to industrial metal and even Gregorian chant . Two of his favourites are a Chiptune take and Jessica Mauboy’s jazzy 1920s version from Underbelly: Razor. (Actress Pippa Grandison also recast it as a fragile piano ballad for the show.)

The skittering electronics anticipate all the club remixes that followed, while the desperate undertones of Sterry’s vocals set the table for gloomier, heavier versions – as does Sterry’s short-lived yet potent guitar solo. And that hook shines just as brightly in instrumental versions. \nReal Life had other minor hits, like the equally urgent Catch Me I’m Falling and somewhat sillier God Tonight . Yet Send Me an Angel has always dogged Sterry, who still performs as Real Life on package tours under the Absolutely 80s banner .

But rather than flee one-hit-wonder status, Sterry has embraced the song’s crowd-pleasing endurance. He cut a more danceable version in 2009 for the covers collection Send Me an Angel – 80s Synth Essentials, on which he also tackled Gary Numan’s Cars and New Order’s Blue Monday. \nHe’ll always be the voice of that song, whether he’s on stage or picking up groceries. “I remember hearing it in my local supermarket,” he recounts. “There was pretty much only the staff and me. They didn’t have the faintest idea who I was. Most of them were quietly mouthing the words. It was surreal.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:05:11.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
