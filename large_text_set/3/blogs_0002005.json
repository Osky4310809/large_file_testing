Amazon Web Services Leon Neal / Getty Images \nAmazon Web Services, a cloud storage company under parent company Amazon, said in a statement today that an authorized employee incorrectly entered a command designed to take a small number of servers offline. \nThat command had been intended to fix a billing system. Instead, the incorrect keystroke knocked even more servers offline and sent many people into a tizzy on Tuesday as websites failed to load. \nRelated: Amazon Web Services Issue Leaves Part of the Internet in Disarray \nWhile Amazon's S3, shorthand for simple storage service, can handle losing a few servers, the massive number switched off led to chaos. The restart process also took longer than expected, which Amazon attributed to the growth of the service over the past few years. \nAmazon said it will be making changes to ensure someone's fat-fingered mistake won't cause another internet freak-out. \nBut on the bright side, at least some people said they used the outage as an excuse to finish work early. tfw amazon web services goes down and you work on the internet pic.twitter.com/4bU2Fn2gKR — Andy Webb (@Webbslinger) February 28, 2017 Thanks @amazon for breaking the internet I get to go home early — Sarah Fran (@andsarahtweets) February 28, 2017 Amazon broke the internet earlier so I only did 45 minutes of actual work today :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:09:01.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
