He had previously been based in Bromley borough between 2002 and 2009. \n\"Keith was a genuinely nice person; nobody had a bad word to say about him. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that's just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back,\" said PC James Aitkenhead, who worked alongside Keith in the TSG. \nConservative MP and former colleague James Cleverly tweeted: \"A lovely man, a friend. I'm heartbroken.\" Mr Cleverly said the two had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer joined the police. \nIn an emotional tribute in the Commons, he later described him as a \"strong, professional public servant\". \nAlso addressing MPs, Prime Minister Theresa May said PC Palmer \"was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten\". \nA minute's silence was held in Parliament and in front of the New Scotland Yard police headquarters at 09:33 GMT - chosen because 933 was the shoulder number on PC Palmer's uniform.
