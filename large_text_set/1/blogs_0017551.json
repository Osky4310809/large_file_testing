It took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the fuck up.\" The 58 year old singer then said, \"to our detractors that insist that this march will never add up to anything, fuck you.\" For good measure, she then said \"fuck\" again. If Madonna's F-bomb offends you, I just hope you were also offended when Trump bragged about \"p***y grabbing.\" pic.twitter.com/w0OHANINCA \n— Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) January 21, 2017 \nAt that point both CNN and MSNBC quickly cut away after Madonna's third f-word, with CNN's Brooke Baldwin apologizing for the expletives that they aired. But C-Span, true to its zero viewers, stuck with its coverage of the march. Madonna continued, saying Saturday's protest was \"the beginning.\" \nQuoted by the Hollywood Reporter , she suggested that during the 2016 presidential election, \"It seems as though we had all slipped into a false sense of comfort, that justice would prevail, that good would win in the end. Well, good did not win this election, but good will win in the end. So what today means is that we are far from the end. Today marks the beginning, the beginning of our story. The revolution starts here, the fight for the right to be free, to be who we are, to be equal. Let’s march together through this darkness and with each step know that we are not afraid, that we are not alone, that we will not back down, that there is power in our unity and that no opposing force stands a chance in the face of true solidarity.\" \nBut while Madonna's verbal outbursts were nothing new, what was far more provocative, and once again prompts questions as to how the media would have responded had it come during Obama's presidency, is what she said next. \nAfter leading the crowd in chants of \"Yes, we're ready,\" Madonna added, \" I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, and I know this won't change anything. We cannot fall into despair.\" Instead, she said that she would \"choose love.\" \nMadonna then performed \"Express Yourself\" and \"Human Nature,\" dedicating the latter song to President Trump, but she said she couldn't even say his name, merely stating that the performance went out to \"the new DT in the White House. 'D' could stand for dick. I don't know.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T00:08:45.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
