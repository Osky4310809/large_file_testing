In terms of design, you have a circular 1.39-inch AMOLED screen with a traditional watch look. If you’re not a fan of Fitbit’s usual design language , this might be of more interest for you.\nInside we have 4GB of internal storage coupled with 512MB of RAM – nothing new here. As it is for the health-conscious among us, it does have an optical heart rate sensor as well as GPS capabilities for hiking and mapping your run. And for the aquatically-inclined, you’d be glad to hear that the watch is waterproof up to 5 ATM. Although it’s not clear yet which version of Android Wear the RunIQ runs on, given its scheduled release date of February 1 st , I doubt it’ll ship with Android Wear 2.0.\nAnd for the aquatically-inclined, you’d be glad to hear that the watch is waterproof up to 5 ATM.\nNew Balance claims that with GPS on, the watch will give you around five hours of use, but without it, it’ll be up to 24 hours. That’s still not really good enough considering you’d be replacing your traditional watch with the RunIQ. When there are smartwatches that last up to three days or more, RunIQ’s battery life might be a serious drawback for some.\nThe company is, however, betting heavily on athletes: New Balance teamed up with Jabra for the ParcelQ sports earbuds, which will be sold as a companion item to the RunIQ. As you might have guessed, the ParcelQ earbuds are Bluetooth headphones that have what’s called a “Sports Button” for receiving direct exercise feedback from your watch.\nRunIQ pre-orders start on January 4 th for $299.99, and its companion earbuds will set you back $109.99. They are both scheduled to ship on February 1 st .\nAre you interested in New Balance’s fitness watch? What features do you look for in a smartwatch?
