Smith is known as something of a lovable knucklehead among NBA fans, and for pretty good reason .\nBut no one was laughing when Smith and his wife, Jewel Harris, shared some sad news last month.\nSEE ALSO: Noted Boston guy Mark Wahlberg has handy excuse for leaving Super Bowl early\nSmith and Harris, who were married just last summer, after his Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA championship , posted a tough video online on Jan. 7. In that video, Harris looked into the camera and told the internet that the couple's baby girl, Dakota, had been born five months early.\nDakota was alive, but five days after birth she weighed just one pound.\n. @TheRealJRSmith and his wife share difficult family news. pic.twitter.com/efNsDANUo8\n— UNINTERRUPTED (@uninterrupted) January 7, 2017\nSmith and Harris didn't provide much more information then, but the situation was clearly dire.\nA preterm berth occurs when a baby is born after less than 37 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says about about 1 in 10 babies born in the U.S. in 2015 was affected by the condition, which can cause serious health issues and even death.\nThat's bad enough, but worse still was that little Dakota was on the extreme end of that spectrum; being born five months early would indicated Harris was pregnant for little more than 20 weeks.\nThe Jan. 7 announcement by Smith and Harris was a somber moment for basketball fans. The news was doubly crushing because it struck Smith, who has seemed to mature a bit in recent years, just after he and Harris had been married, and just after he'd won his first NBA title.\nOn Monday, though, Smith updated the world with a bit of good news.\n\"Today is one of the greatest days of my life,\" he wrote to caption a photo he shared on Instagram . \"Today I get to hold my youngest for the first time! GOD is GREAT! #DakotaStrong\"\nToday is one of the greatest days of my life. Today I get to hold my youngest for the first time!
