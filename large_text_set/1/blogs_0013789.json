Photo: AP \nThe record hot year was marked by heatwaves in South Asia and the Middle East, with Kuwait reaching 54 degrees in July - a reading that may be Asia's hottest on record. \nExtraordinarily warm northern temperatures have slowed or reversed Arctic sea ice formation this winter, while at the southern end of the planet, Antarctic sea ice has also been tracking at record low levels in satellite data collected over more than three decades. \nIn combination, climate scientists in the past week have estimated the Earth has not had such low extent of sea ice in thousands of years. With less ice, less solar radiation is reflected back to space, ending up in the exposed seas instead - contributing to further build-up of warmth in the regions. \n\"Greenland glacier melt - one of the contributors to sea level rise - started early and fast,\" Mr Taalas said. \n\"The Arctic is warming twice as fast a the global average,\" he said. \"The persistent loss of sea ice is driving weather, climate and ocean circulation patterns in other parts of the world.\" \n(See NASA chart below for the areas of the planet with the biggest departures from the long-run average temperature.) \nEl Nino years tend to spur global temperatures as changing wind patterns in the Pacific means the giant ocean absorbs less heat from the atmosphere. \nThe 2015-16 El Nino was the third-strongest on record. Conditions have been neutral since the El Nino pattern broke down in the first half of last year. \nFor Australia, 2016 was the country's fourth hottest year according to mean temperature data going back to 1910. \nAmong other agencies recording last year as the hottest on record was Japan's Meteorological Agency, which released preliminary data earlier this week. \nFollow Peter Hannam on Twitter and Facebook .
