One thing to note is that the membership is being offered at a subsidised price from 1 March 2017 till 31 March 2017. There are no details on the actual pricing but it is likely that the price of the subscription will shoot up once the promotional period is over.\nMukesh Ambani announced that Jio’s total subscriber base had crossed the 100 million mark. The 100 million subscriber base was achieved within just 170 days after launch. Reliance Jio also announced the launch of paid tariff plans in addition to the Rs 303 plan that would give users the same benefits as they are enjoying in the Happy New Year plan.\nWe have detailed the paid tariff plans for both prepaid as well as postpaid customers so they can decide on what plan to enroll for. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd soared over 10 percent after its telecom venture Jio said it will begin charging for data services from April. We have detailed everything that you may want to know about the Jio Prime Membership before enrolling for it tomorrow.\nEligibility \nAll the current Reliance Jio members and the people who will enroll between 1 and 31 March 2017 will be eligible to get the benefits of Jio Prime Membership .\nBenefits \nReliance Jio Prime members can continue to enjoy the unlimited benefits that they currently enjoy under the Reliance Jio ‘Happy New Year Offer’ for another full year until 31 March 2018. Mukesh Ambani further added that Reliance Jio will introduce more exciting plans for Jio Prime Members.\n\nThe details of the plans will be available on MyJio app or Jio.com . In addition to unlimited data and calling benefits, Jio Prime Members will get complimentary access to Jio Media Services that include JioTV, JioCinema, JioMusic, JioMags and JioExpressNews. Reliance Jio is also working with its partners to offer exclusive offers to Jio Prime Members, the details of which have not been finalised yet. These deals can be accessed using Reliance MyJio app.\nPrice \nThe eligible member can enroll in Jio Prime Membership for Rs 99 for the first year. Rs 99 is a one time fee that you will have to pay to enroll in the membership program. For existing Jio users who pay Rs 99 and become the Jio Prime members, they will then just have to pay a flat fee of Rs 303 per month (which translates to about Rs 10 per day) to continue using their Jio number with the same benefits of the ‘Happy New Year Offer’.\n\nThat means free voice calling, free access to Jio services and 1GB/day limit on data usage. The users don’t have to pay anything for the Jio Media Services worth Rs 10,000 for one year.\nHow and Where to enroll for Jio Prime Membership \nEnrollment for Reliance Jio Prime will start on 1 March and will go on till 31 March 2017. The users can use the MyJio app for Android or iOS or visit Jio.com to become a Jio Prime member. They can also visit Reliance Digital, Jio Retail Store or any Jio Partner Store to enroll for the membership.\nDisclaimer: Reliance Jio is owned by Reliance Industries, who also own Network18, the publisher of Firstpost and tech2. \nThe post Reliance Jio Prime Membership enrollment to start from 1 March: Here is all you need to know appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:17:51.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
