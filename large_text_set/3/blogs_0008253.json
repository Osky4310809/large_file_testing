Rand Paul, R-Ky., said at a news conference hosted by the Freedom Caucus, according to Fox News . “Conservatives have a replacement plan.” \nPaul was referring to a “clean repeal” bill that he planned to introduce with Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C. The implication was that Paul and Sanford’s bills would diverge more significantly from Obamacare than the current proposal crafted by House Republicans and supported by the White House. \nThere’s perhaps another reason for Trump’s choice of venue and date: March 15 will be the 250th anniversary of the birth of President Andrew Jackson, a Tennessean often cited as the closest analog to the populist President Trump. \nIn fact, the president has hung a portrait of Jackson — a vehemently anti-establishment candidate whose 1828 election was a reaction against a political class perceived to be corrupt and distant — in the Oval Office.
