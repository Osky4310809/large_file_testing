which he observed is enough potent tool to lift the nation out of recession if fully embraced by the youths who make up the highest percentage of Nigeria’s population. \nHe applauded the feats of the students of Paul University, who built mobile and web apps to meet the needs and solve societal problems; while applauding the Founder of Women in Technology of Nigeria (WITIN), Mrs. Martha Omoekpen Alade, for bringing the Young Coders Club to Paul University, a hub that grooms young developers. \nHub that grooms young developers \nThe Vice Chancellor stressed the need for government to make the economy stable for the populace to come out with innovations that will solve people’s problems. \nThe VC commended the outstanding students who pitched their apps to the entire university community. They include Ezewanne Chidinma, Ejimgini Ginika, Maureen Osita, Nzelu Adaobi, Isaac Ogochukwu and Ofo-muogbo Daniel, who built “RIBE – An Ibo Cuisine app”; Ibegbu Christian Amala; Anaso Ebuke Precious; Nwogu Kelechi; Nwose Benjamin Ebuka and Muanya Ugochukwu (Built “Tourist Buddy app”). \nOthers are William Anazodo, Bethel Nmerah, Dijeh Emmanuel, Robby Emmanuel and Eusebius Nnaemeka (Built “NCHE – Anambra Security Beacon app”); Okafor Christopher, Umejiuba Valentine, Ubochi Chiemeka, Okoro Favour and Anthony Ruth(Built “Ezicha – a Safe environment app”) and Olisaemeaka Chukwuebuka, Muttoh Chinonso, Okoronkwo Mercy, Okaro Kenechukwu and Emeka Anaso( built “Agroplay – An agricultural gaming app”). \nHighlighting the critical role of computing to modern economy, Head of Computer Science and Information Technology department of the Paul University, Prof Paul Nosike, said apart from solving major problems, ICT also creates jobs and curbs youth restiveness “because they are kept busy doing something.” \nNosike explained that the education of future generations of computer scientists is critically important. There is need to improve computer science education at all levels, stressing that computational literacy —being able to code, script, design, program, debug, and understand computer science—is rapidly emerging as an essential skill for today’s students. \nCommissioner for Education, Anambra State Prof. Kate Azuka Omenugha represented by Ikechukwu Odogwu, described the commemoration of Computer Education Week organised by Computer Science Students of Paul University as a purposeful step in the best direction. \nSpeaking to the audience in the presence of the VC and other Principal Officers of the University, the commissioner challenged them to use the skills to earn a living even while studying here at Paul University. \nShe frowned at those who after graduating from such a global asset-based discipline and lucrative, go about seeking for a “white collar job.” \nThe Commissioner thanked the Organizers of the first ever computer week among the private and mission higher institutions in Anambra State and informed them of the State Government commitment in advancing the computer literacy of the citizens.
