Blessings. #ESGN #YOL2 3/31,” Gibbs wrote.

I answer the phone: ‘Dude. Everything ok? It’s 3 in the morning’. He replies. ‘Bro. I’m in Paris. I’m at the Louvre. I know what the next album cover is gonna be…The Wedding at Cana by Paolo Veronese,'” Sam Spratt wrote. Damn. Thank you so much for the comments on the cover. Here's just a small bit of the story of how it came to be. So much more to share. pic.twitter.com/IH2kcY67yi \n— Sam Spratt (@SamSpratt) March 29, 2017 \nHe then revealed that Logic, who has yet to respond to the cover art controversy, wanted his wife, family, friends, and people of all races depicted in the work of art. \nLogic has previously shared an image of the painting on IG about six weeks ago. A post shared by logic301 (@logic301) on Feb 14, 2017 at 1:31pm PST \nFreddie Gibbs’ You Only Live 2wice album is scheduled to drop tomorrow (March 31), and Logic’s Everybody is expected on May 5.
