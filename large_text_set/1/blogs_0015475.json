Then he set up Gouffran for the second goal of a comfortable win – their first in this competition since January 2012. Gouffran was brought down in the box after nine minutes (Photo: PA) Matt Ritchie made no mistake from the spot (Photo: Getty) \nIn injury time Shelvey crossed from the byline to give Ritchie a tap in, his second of the night, and eight for the season. \nNew boss Gianfranco Zola has not won any of his seven games in charge since succeeding sacked Gary Rowett, but got a consolation from David Cotterill. \nShelvey showed what Newcastle, who now play Oxford United in the fourth round, have missed after eight minutes. \nHe unpicked the visiting defence with a pass the sent Gouffran, unusually playing as a striker, through on goal. Yoan Gouffran nets his spectacular winner (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) \nKeeper Adam Legzdins brought him down and Ritchie stepped up to convert the penalty kick. \nShelvey came close to scoring with a brilliant 40 yard volley that Legzdins scrambled away. \nThen he made Newcastle's second after 35 minutes for Gouffran. \nThe French star is fighting for a new contract and impressed up front on his own with slick movement. \nHe wriggled clear to collect a Shelvey free kick, flicked the ball up and volleyed home to give United a cushion. \nGouffran is one of the players who has thrived under Benitez and could be worth hanging on to as a squad man next season when he is out of contract.
