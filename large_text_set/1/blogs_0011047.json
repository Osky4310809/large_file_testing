And he has a Glenn Beckian conspiracy map on his whiteboard to prove it. \nThe gist of Kim’s argument is that there’s a Bible verse ( 1 Cor 6:9 ) that specifically says “abusers of themselves with mankind” will not inherit the kingdom of God, a verse he believes condemns homosexuality. But gay people and Steven Anderson, Kim says (oddly lumping the two together), wrongly interpret that particular phrase to say it’s referring to abusers or rapists. \nAnderson uses other verses to condemn homosexuality, but not that one, and that makes him a bad fundie. \n… Now, the sodomites, they don’t like this verse. So I guarantee you, if you haven’t seen it before, then you have not done street preaching. Which is not a surprise, ’cause Steven Anderson has never done it — he’s against it — but aside from that… \n… \nThat’s ridiculous. But Steven Anderson preaches that, too. In his total blindness going against the sodomites, he joins the sodomites in this interpretation. He says that maybe somebody drunk too much alcohol and it forced them to do the sodomite action, or a child who was raised in a homosexual couple and then they forced him to do the sexual act. He has no idea that he’s supporting them in this interpretation … \n… \nSteven Anderson, why do you join the homosexual crowd? Maybe another stepping stone for you to become like them? \nShade thrown. \nIt’s a strange competition to try and out-bigot the man who celebrated the Pulse nightclub massacre by saying, “The good news is that there’s 50 less pedophiles in this world.” But that’s what blind faith does: It pushes you to say or do unthinkable things because you believe it’s what God wants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T04:08:29.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
