However, the notch was disallowed after the video assistant referee adjudged the Atletico Madrid forward to be offside. Ince has received mixed feedback on his \"Darling\" comment (Photo: ITV 4) \nIn the second half, Gerard Deulofeu was ruled offside as he tapped home 13 minutes from time. But video technology was on hand once again to reverse the linesman's incorrect decision. \nNaturally, video technology's influence on the match led to Oatley and Ince discussing its introduction. Ince was against the idea and suggested it may take five years for him to warm to it. Oatley appeared to laugh off Ince's comment (Photo: ITV 4) \nThe former Manchester United star said that \"getting decisions right takes the emotion out of the game\" and \"football is all about right and wrong decisions\". \nWhereas Oatley argued the decision being right is the most important factor. \nThe presenter also stated that the introduction of video technology would see a decrease in the abuse referees, linesmen and fourth officials receive. \nWhile Ince admitted that was a \"positive\", he was still unsure about the concept, and added: \"We'll have another chat [about video-technology] in five years' time, darling.\" Ryan Giggs and Paul Ince in 1994 (Photo: John Peters/Manchester United) \nOatley laughed his comment off and responded: \"Alright darling, I'll look forward to that.\" \nFollowing his comment, Ince has since received mixed feedback from viewers: \nJames Dornan on Twitter said: \"Paul Ince complaining that technology got two 'wrong' decisions right. Football all about wrong decisions. Then called presenter Darling.\" \nDaniel Green on Twitter said: \"Paul ince just called the host on itv4 darling. Good chance of him getting sacked after that.\" \nAnd London Raider added: \"Does anyone know what the hell Paul Ince is on about? #FRAESP and he just called her darling? What a prat.\" \nBut Ince did receive some defence from the online community: \nHarry on Twitter said: \"Paul Ince getting bashed for saying darling? Grow up people. That's pretty much slang. If it offends you? Get over your self.\" \nRyan Arthur on Twitter said: \"People need to chill out over Paul Ince calling the presenter 'darling'. Must be bored!!\" \nWhile another added: \"Paul Ince called the presenter darling, what's the big deal lol. Call her a 'mate' instead?\" \nMirror Football has contacted Jacqui Oatley for a comment.
