The two had been competing head-to-head for several prior years. \nApple, Alphabet, and Amazon all listed on the Nasdaq, the exchange that became associated with tech for decades. But the NYSE has been inching in on their space, claiming companies like Alibaba and Square. \nIn an effort to continue its association with the tech community, the Nasdaq opened up its Entrepreneurial Center in San Francisco in 2015. Run by a separate non-profit, the group mentors up-and-coming startups and also provides a West Coast location for ringing the opening or closing bells. \nThe Nasdaq also has its own index, called the Nasdaq 100, which incorporates many tech giants including Microsoft, Intel and eBay. \nSnap is expected to reveal its IPO filing later this week. That would mean the investor roadshow is slated to kick off in late February and the public debut would happen in early March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T19:10:00.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
