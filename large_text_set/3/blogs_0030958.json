Officer William Martin: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 3:36 pm EDT, January 26, 2017 30 Comments By Tom Cleary 27.8k Share Tweet Follow Officer William Martin was suspended for 10 days for the arrest of Jacqueline Craig and her daughters in Fort Worth, Texas. (Facebook screenshot) \nBody camera video from the controversial arrest of a mother and her daughters in Forth Worth, Texas, has leaked online after police refused to make it public. \nThe video shows Officer William Martin arresting 46-year-old Jacqueline Craig , her 19-year-old daughter, Brea Hymond and Craig’s 15-year-old daughter after the family called police for help. Craig had reported to police that a man had assaulted her son for littering. But after a combative Martin showed up on scene, it was Craig and her daughters who ended up in handcuffs again. \nVideo posted to Facebook by Craig’s family after the December 2016 incident showed Martin violently throwing the three women to the ground during their arrests, which were all made by him before any backup arrived. \nIn early January, Martin was found to have committed excessive force, along with several other violations, and was suspended for 10 days without pay. \nFort Worth Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald has said Martin’s actions were “rude,” but said the arrest was not caused by racism. Martin is white, while Craig and her daughters are black. \nFitzgerald said Martin is “sorry” and contrite” about the incident. He has returned to active duty while his 10-day suspension is appealed. \nMartin will not be facing criminal charges. The Tarrant County Prosecutor’s Office said Thursday that Martin’s case will not be taken to the grand jury, saying no felonies were committed during the incident in their view. The cases against Craig and her daughters will also not be reviewed by a grand jury. Neither will the case against Craig’s neighbor. \nHere’s what you need to know about Officer Martin and the incident: 1. Officer Martin Tells Craig to ‘Teach Your Son Not to Litter’ After She Says the Boy Was Choked by Their Neighbor Jacqueline Craig and her daughters are seen in body camera footage from their arrest by Officer William Martin in Fort Worth, Texas. (Youtube screenshot) \nThe incident occurred December 21 in the southwest side of Fort Worth. \nThe video begins with Officer Martin speaking with a white man who has been identified by the family as a the neighbor they say assaulted Jackie Craig’s young son for littering. \nYou can watch the full video below (warning — video contains graphic language and violence): \nYou can watch the original video recorded by Craig’s daughter below: \nMartin then walks over to Craig and asks her “what’s going on with you?” She tells the officer the man “grabbed and choked” her son. She tells the officer the man grabbed the boy because he “defied” him. She says the man should have come to her instead of “putting your hands on my son.” \nMartin then tells Craig, “why don’t you teach your son not to litter?” \nShe responds, “He can’t prove to me that my son littered, but it doesn’t matter if he did or didn’t, it doesn’t give him the right to put his hands on him.” \nMartin then says, “why not?” As the conversation gets more heated, the officer asks Craig why she is yelling, and she says because “you pissed me off.” \nHe then tells her, “if you keep yelling at me you’re going to piss me off and I’m going to take you to jail.” \nCraig’s daughter then walks toward her mother and the officer, appearing to try to calm her mother down, and the officer grabs her from behind. Craig then yells at the officer not to grab her, and the scene turns chaotic. \nThe video then cuts to Craig on the ground with the officer kneeling in her back, his Taser in his hand. He points the Taser at a young girl, and then also at Craig’s daughter, who scrambles away as the officer handcuffs Craig. He then goes and handcuffs Craig’s daughter, before taking them both to his SUV. \nHe then turns his attention to the woman recording the incident, and runs at her, knocking the camera out of her hand and telling her, “you’re going to jail too.” Officer William Martin. (Facebook/Porsha Craver) \n“The officer physically, violently, and brutally escalated the situation,” Craig’s attorney, Lee Merritt, told WFAA-TV. “At that point the man should have been placed under arrest but instead the mother was questioned. She was questioned about why she did not teach her son not to litter.” \nMartin wrote in his report, obtained by The Root , that it did not seem plausible that anyone would choke a child for littering: \nIt did not make sense to me that the (white male) would randomly choke a child for no reason or that anyone would choke a child for simply littering. The (white male’s) account of what happened sounded plausible. Due to my experience of handling many calls similar to this, I believed that the account of “choking” may have been exaggerated. I believed that it was improper for the (white male) to grab the child, but I had not yet determined that any offense of assault had occurred. I wonder why the child’s mother had not called for medical attention if a child had been injured in this way. \nThe white male seen in the video has not been identified. Prosecutors will presenta case against him to a grand jury. \nMartin said in his statement that the man told him he did grab the boy. \n“The W/M stated that a child had thrown a piece of trash in his yard. The W/M approached the child and grabbed his arm and told him to pick up the trash. When the child refused, the W/M grabbed the child by the back of the neck and demanded that the child pick up the trash,” Martin wrote in his report. \nMartin also said in his report that he asked Craig why her son had littered because “I was irritated by the tone and level” of her voice” and “that a situation ove rlittering had gotten so out of hand.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T10:56:05.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
