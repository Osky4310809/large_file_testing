Artemenko , and businessman Felix H. Sater . Sater and Artemenko have both been convicted of white-collar crimes; Sater in particular pleaded guilty to a stock manipulation scheme masterminded by the mafia.\nWhen contacted by The Times , Cohen initially admitted he had delivered the secret document to Flynn’s office:\nHe said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn’s office.\nMr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.\nBut here’s what Cohen told Mediaite’s sister site LawNewz this morning:\nI acknowledge that the brief meeting took place, but emphatically deny discussing this topic or delivering any documents to the White House and/or General Flynn; something I stated to [ New York Times reporter Megan Twohey ].\nIt’s hard to square Cohen’s claim that he told Twohey that he never delivered a document to Flynn with the Times ‘ reporting that he admitted just that.\nThe Times defended their reporting in a statement to The Washington Post : “Mr. Cohen told The Times in no uncertain terms that he delivered the Ukraine proposal to Michael Flynn’s office at the White House. Mr. Sater told the Times that Mr. Cohen had told him the same thing,” said deputy managing editor Matt Purdy .\n[image via screengrab]\n——\n>>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter\nHave ", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/HashtagGriswold", "http://nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html?_r=0", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ftrump-lawyer-gives-two-contradicting-stories-when-asked-if-he-delivered-secret-russia-doc%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Ftrump-lawyer-gives-two-contradicting-stories-when-asked-if-he-delivered-secret-russia-doc%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/vlcsnap-2016-05-24-08h50m59s611-e1487597256570-1.png&description=Trump%20Lawyer%20Gives%20Two%20Contradicting%20Stories%20When%20Asked%20If%20He%20Delivered%20Secret%20Russia%20Doc", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/amid-russia-scrutiny-trump-associates-received-informal-ukraine-policy-proposal/2017/02/19/72b0b264-f6eb-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_ukraine-12am:homepage/story&utm_term=.bcb2a34e0d20", "http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/100-untrue-trumps-personal-attorney-michael-cohen-denies-hes-under-fbi-investigation/"], "published": "2017-02-20T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:16:02.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
