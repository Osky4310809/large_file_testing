And in February, the airline launched $65 flights from Rhode Island and New York to Edinburgh, Belfast, Cork, Dublin, and Shannon. \nIt’s not just Norwegian offering super-cheap seats to Europe. WOW Air, too, has introduced flights for less than $70 one-way . \nWhile these $89 fares are likely to sell out fast, they’re not part of any particular flash sale. Instead, Norwegian and WOW are looking to make affordable air travel to Europe the norm . And they’ve been able to do so by introducing new, energy-efficient aircraft (A330-300s, Boeing 737MAX planes) and servicing smaller airports. \nThese $89 flights to Bergen, for example, won’t fly out of John F. Kennedy International Airport. Instead, travelers will have to depart from Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, New York. That’s about an hour and a half north of Manhattan. \nReady to fly to Norway? Tickets at this price can be found using the airline’s low fare calendar .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:12:35.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
