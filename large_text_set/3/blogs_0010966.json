The producer seemed unimpressed with Luger‚Äôs initial request of $50,000 and suggested that those taking part in the battle put up $100,000 instead. \n‚ÄúSo, I wake up. I got a DM from Lex Luger talking about a beat battle with me, Metro, and Sonny,‚Äù Southside said in the video. ‚ÄúLex, this is $50,000 ‚Ä¶ Until you got a whole 100 on you you can gamble with, bro. Don‚Äôt hit me talking about no beat battle ‚Ä¶ Put a whole hundred on the table and we can beat battle.‚Äù A post shared by SOUTHSIDE (@808mafiaboss) on Mar 9, 2017 at 12:42pm PST \nLuger has since accepted Southside‚Äôs offer to battle for $100K, in a series of videos uploaded to Instagram yesterday (March 12). \n‚ÄúSizzle, call my phone.

The epic, two-hour long beat extravaganza reached its apex when Swizz unleashed a monstrous track featuring DMX, Jadakiss, Jay Z, and Nas. \nGiven the success of his battle with Just Blaze, Swizz is now attempting to orchestrate a DJ battle between New York City veterans DJ Clue and Funkmaster Flex. \nThere is no word yet on whether or not Metro Boomin and Sonny Digital have agreed to take part in the beat battle with Lex Luger, or if/when Lex and Southside will make their battle official.
