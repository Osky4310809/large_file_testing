After considering his record, watching his testimony in front of the Judiciary Committee and meeting with him twice, I will vote to confirm him to be the ninth justice on the Supreme Court.” Sen. Manchin concludes, “I hold no illusions that I will agree with every decision Judge Gorsuch may issue in the future, but I have not found any reasons why this jurist should not be a Supreme Court Justice.”\nSenator Heitkamp also released a statement on Twitter:\nI will vote for Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.

Heitkamp goes on to say that Republicans “played politics at its worst” with Judge Merrick Garland but adds, “I was taught that two wrongs don’t make a right.”\nManchin and Heitkamp are two of ten Democratic Senators who are up for reelection in 2018 in states which Trump won last year. It was expected that some of those vulnerable Democrats would peel off from the progressives in order to avoid creating a campaign issue that can be used against them next year. According to polls, a plurality of Americans and a solid majority of Republicans\nEarlier this month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would not be voting for Gorsuch and called for a filibuster to block his confirmation. So far, 33 Senate Democrats have said they will vote against him .
