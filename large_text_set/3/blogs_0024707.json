Because I have the (completely unrelated to Florean Flortescue’s) ice cream flavor for you! \nYuengling Ice Cream, from Pennsylvania and not Diagon Alley, is now offering Butterbeer ice cream: Yuengling’s Ice Cream \nSo, what’s the overall taste you can expect if you decide to drown your Moaning Myrtle-like sorrows in a tub of Butterbeer ice cream? \nButtercream and butterscotch flavors, in addition to a butterscotch swirl. Giphy \nPresident of Yuengling’s Ice Cream, David Yuengling, said in a statement, \nWe are always looking for ways to inspire our fans and spark creativity. Whether it’s our flavor names and descriptions or the recipes themselves—we’re in the business of having fun. We hope we made JK Rowling proud with this flavor. Needless to say, the Muggle equivalent of owl-messaging, Twitter , could not contain its glee. Thank you @YuenglingsIC for creating Butterbeer ice cream!!! ❤️❤️ #Potterheads will forever be grateful! I can not wait to try it! \n— Sarah McCandlish (@SarahLiz217) March 21, 2017 For one Twitter user, this is the best thing to ever happen to ice cream.
