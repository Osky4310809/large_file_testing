Sure, that gravity sometimes comes at the expense of the acting quality, but not every time! Here are 10 amazing performances from rockers in mainstream films. David Bowie in The Man Who Fell To Earth \nDavid Bowie had many film roles, but it was this one in The Man Who Fell To Earth , where he played a translucent and effervescent alien, which always felt the most apt. Meat Loaf in The Rocky Horror Picture Show \nMeat Loaf’s goofy but short-lived role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show stayed in fans' minds just as long as the film. Prince in Purple Rain \nPrince is everything you would ever want from a Prince role in this legendary rock film. Keith Richards in Pirates of the Caribbean: World’s End \nIt’s been known for a while that Johnny Depp based his performance as Jack Sparrow on Keith Richards. It only makes sense then that the role of Cap'n Jack's father would go to the man who may as well have been the father of the performance. The Beatles in A Hard Day’s Night \nThe Beatles’ faces have been in better movies (like Yellow Submarine ), but their non-animated performances in A Hard Day’s Night definitively defined their image. Bruce Springsteen in High Fidelity \nThe patron saint of New Jersey dispensed his wisdom in the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity . Aimee Man in The Big Lebowski \nAimee Mann both eats diner food and has a bad foot in The Big Lebowski . Phil Collins in Hook \nWhen Phil Collins isn’t playing with his band Genesis, he is investigating the disappearance of children in the film Hook (as you do). Jack White in Walk Hard \nThe King of Being Half of The White Stripes played The King of Rock!? It’s true! \nAny great rocker roles I missed?
