Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWayne Rooney believes England will have a better chance of succeeding if the division between media and players dissipates. \nThrust into the spotlight as a 16-year-old at Everton , the striker is well versed with life in the public eye and all that it entails. \nSuch focus brings praise like that which followed Saturday's record-breaking 250th Manchester United goal and the ire that comes with captaining England to a galling Euro 2016 exit to Iceland. \nRooney touched on such peaks and troughs upon receiving the Football Writers' Association Tribute Award on Sunday evening, but hopes bridges can be built between players and media for the betterment of the national team.

Rooney's goal against Stoke broke Sir Bobby Charlton's record (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Read More Rooney IS a Man United great - he deserves his place in the Old Trafford Hall of Fame \n\"Like most great players, unfortunately, Wayne will only be truly appreciated for what he has achieved in the game when he is long retired or perhaps we could all start appreciating him now in this moment\" the latter, now at West Brom, said. \n\"As a Scotsman, I will admit reluctantly that England have had some great players but tonight we are privileged we are in the company of another one. \n\"Not only Manchester United's top goalscorer but England's most capped outfield player and top goalscorer.\" \nEngland manager Gareth Southgate was another in attendance, just a day after Rooney usurped Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time top scorer.
