(Chicago Police Department; Cook County Sheriff's Department) \nCHICAGO (CBS) — Two more men have been charged with the fatal shooting of a 2-year-old boy and his uncle that also left a pregnant woman wounded on Valentine’s Day in the North Lawndale neighborhood on the West Side. \nBond was denied Friday for Doniel Harris, 19, who faces one count of murder, according to the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. \nOn Friday, Jeremy Ellis, 19, was charged with murder and attempted murder, the state’s attorney’s office said. He is expected to appear in bond court Saturday. \nDevon Swan, 26, was ordered held without bond last week after he was charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. \nThe three are charged with the Feb. 14 shooting deaths of 2-year-old Lavontay Smith and his 26-year-old uncle, Lazarec Collins, authorities said. Collins’ 21-year-old girlfriend, who is 4 months pregnant, was wounded in the attack. \nThe three victims were in a car in the 2300 block of South Kenneth, with Collins’ girlfriend driving, shortly before 1:30 p.m. Feb. 14 when the shooting occurred. \nLavontay White (Source: Facebook) \nAs they were driving, a blue Chevrolet Spark, occupied by Swan and three others, pulled up alongside and two people inside opened fire, prosecutors said. The car is owned by Swan’s girlfriend, who loaned it to him after he dropped her off at work an hour earlier, prosecutors said. \nCollins was shot five times in his abdomen, back and legs; Lavontay was shot once in the back of the head, prosecutors said. The bullet eventually exited through his cheek. Both were pronounced dead at Stroger Hospital. \nCollins’ girlfriend was streaming live to Facebook at the time of the shooting and was shot once in the abdomen, authorities said. She was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. \nProsecutors said the shooting was retribution for the shooting death of one of Swan’s friends whom the shooters believed Collins was responsible for. \nAt least one more suspect is still being sought, police said. \nFuneral services for Lavontay and Collins are set for Saturday. \n(Source: Sun-Times Media Wire copy; Chicago Sun-Times 2017.
