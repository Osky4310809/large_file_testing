I'm very surprised. Why is this not considered a security issue? (especially for desktop PCs) – Meligy Sep 23 '12 at 5:42 82 It isn't a security issue, because you still have to be sitting in front of the machine to do this. And if you have physical access to the computer you can do pretty much anything to it anyway. – Bobble Oct 3 '12 at 0:51 34 Just to follow-up on Bobble's correct comment: if you have physical access to a machine, you can take the disk out and mount it on a totally separate system where you do have root. Just as one example. The only protection against full data compromise in the face of physical access is strong disk encryption. – arielf Mar 3 '13 at 19:59 5 Just to add to the security issues coming up here, it is possible to protect your root password by setting a root password using sudo passwd when you do remember the password. However, by doing this you will have to enter the password even in recovery mode, which will make this solution useless and you will have to always remember the root password(not the administrative account one). – jobin Nov 4 '13 at 10:15 2 This solution resulted in a \"Authentication token manipulation\" error with Ubuntu 13.10. I had to do these steps further . – Luís de Sousa Mar 25 '14 at 20:44 up vote 47 down vote \nYes, you can change the old password via GRUB . \nIf you have a single-boot (Ubuntu is the only operating system on your computer), to get the boot menu to show, you have to hold down the Shift key during bootup. \nIf you have a dual-boot (Ubuntu is installed next to Windows, another Linux operating system, or Mac OS X; and you choose at boot time which operating system to boot into), the boot menu should appear without the need to hold down the shift key. \nFrom the boot menu, select recovery mode, which is usually the second boot option. \nAfter you select recovery mode and wait for all the boot-up processes to finish, you'll be presented with a few options. In this case, you want the Drop to root shell prompt option so press the ᛎ Down arrow to get to that option, and then press Enter to select it. \nOnce you're at the root shell prompt, if you have forgotten your username as well, type ls /home (small letters & not capitals). This will list all the user accounts in your set up. \nTo reset the password, type passwd username where username is the username you want to reset, for example, passwd mysterio in my case. \nYou'll then be prompted for a new password. When you type the password you will get no visual response acknowledging your typing. Your password is still being accepted. Just type the password and hit Enter when you're done. You'll be prompted to retype the password. Do so and hit Enter again. \nNow the password should be reset. Type exit to return to the recovery menu. \nAfter you get back to the recovery menu, select resume normal boot , and use Ubuntu as you normally would — only this time, you actually know the password!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T09:47:18.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
