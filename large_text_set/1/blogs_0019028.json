His promises ranged from the impossible —expelling all undocumented immigrants — to the more feasible, such as enacting a hiring freeze on all federal employees.\nTrump made a lot of promises about what he will do as president. We’ve documented 663 of them. \nAs he prepared to take the oath of office Friday morning, his supporters in the inauguration crowds told ThinkProgress what they want to see him tackle on Saturday, his first full day in office. Their priorities range from immigration to health care and the economy.\n“I’d like to see him repeal and replace Obamacare,” Chicago resident Alex Robinson said.\n“Just make America great again. Do what you say you’re going to do,” said Janice Cercone. PHOTO: Victoria Fleischer/ThinkProgress. But they don’t expect him to accomplish everything he promised.\n“Most politicians come in with a huge number of promises and end up doing almost nothing,” said Ronald Borta, who drove to DC from Warrenton, Virginia. “So if he does a tiny little bit on his first day, that’ll be a vast improvement.”\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania resident Janice Cercone agreed.\n“Do what you’re supposed to do and live up to your promises,” she said, adding that she would be happy if he accomplished just half of what he said he would.\n“If you need help building the wall, call me.”\nWhat Trump’s supporters want to see him accomplish on day one was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:22:21.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
