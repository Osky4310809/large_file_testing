He has impressive influence and power, and owns eighty-four ships, including his own pleasure barge which he often takes sailing on the Jade Sea . \nIn the books the Qartheen, and Xaro himself, are described as pale-skinned, while the actor Nonso Anozie is black, the series giving the explanation that he is a foreigner from the Summer Islands who has been accepted into Qartheen society. In the novels, he is described as having pale skin and a long, beaklike nose crusted with jewels: rubies, opals and flakes of jade. The series also departs from the novels in having him vouch for Daenerys at the gates of Qarth; in A Clash of Kings , Daxos was one of three Qartheen representatives (with Pyat Pree and Quaithe ) who returned to her with Jhogo and invited her to Qarth. \nXaro offers Daenerys the hospitality of his home while she is in the city, and generously gives her many valuable gifts. He proposes to Daenerys, but she soon learns he only wishes to marry her to claim one of her dragons. A Qartheen marriage custom allows each of the newlyweds to ask the other for a gift of any one thing in their possession, and the request may not be refused. \nThe books suggest that Xaro might actually be homosexual, as his mansion is noted to have numerous young attractive male slaves, and Daenerys ' POV narration points out that despite his verbal protestations of passion for her, his eyes barely linger on her body, even when she wears a traditional Qartheen dress, which leaves one breast bare. The TV series gives no hint of this, and instead shows him sharing his bed with Dany's servant, Doreah . In either case, Xaro honestly and upfront explains to Daenerys that his offer of marriage is basically a mutually beneficial business proposition: he gets Daenerys and her dragons, she gets his money to retake Westeros with. The TV series heavily altered and expanded upon the Qarth storyline from the second book: Daxos never betrays Daenerys to Pyat Pree (her dragons are never stolen), nor does he take part in a conspiracy to become the king of Qarth. He is well and secure in Qarth when Daenerys leaves, not locked in a vault: in fact, no such vault is mentioned in the books. \nAfter the destruction of House of the Undying , Xaro warns Daenerys that Pyat Pree and the other warlocks intend to harm her, and proposes to her once more. When Daenerys rejects his proposal, he becomes unfriendly. He tells her to quit his house and demands that she returns his gifts. He urges her to leave Qarth, and she does. \nIn \"A Dance with Dragons\" , Xaro visits Daenerys in Meereen . He scoffs at her attempts to abolish slavery in Meereen and declares that the condition of the ex-slaves she freed is now much worse than before, being forced to perform manual chores that they are no used to and do not fit their skills, and the city that was once rich and fat and peaceful is now poor, hungry and bloody. Daenerys cannot refute what Xaro says. \nXaro warns Daenerys that she has many enemies both in Slaver's Bay and the Free Cities , and that Pyat Pree with his fellow warlocks are also after her. He tells that Yunkai has hired two legions from New Ghis and three companies of sellswords : the Company of the Cat, the Long Lances, and the Windblown ; two of the Free Cities ( Tolos and Mantarys ), whose economy depends on slavery, have formed an alliance with Yunkai against her, and the others may too. Daenerys says she has made alliance with Lhazar , but that makes Xaro laugh, for everyone knows the Lhazareen are not warriors. \nXaro gives Daenerys thirteen galleys without any price, providing that she leaves for Westeros . Daenerys is tempted to do so, but knows that thirteen ships will carry only a small fraction of her followers. The rest will be enslaved again, or take their chance at the only possible overland route - the notorious demon road, what will probably cost the lives of most of them. Ser Barristan Selmy urges Daenerys to accept Xaro's offer, but her other subordinates beg her not to. Daenerys decides to stay. Xaro is furious to hear that, and threatens Daenerys: \"Take these ships and sail away, or you will surely die screaming. You cannot know how many enemies you have made... I should have slain you in Qarth.\" Angrily, Daenerys orders him to leave immediately. The next day Xaro takes the ships and sails away, leaving Daenerys a \"gift\": a bloodstained glove on a black satin pillow. Daenerys knows the meaning of this - war. Behind the scenes \nOn the Season 2 Blu-ray, Xaro narrates Histories & Lore videos on \" Qarth \" and \" The Warlocks \" . \nWriter Bryan Cogman explained the decision to change Xaro to be a black man from the Summer Islands who moved to Qarth years ago: \"In terms of Xaro, Xaro in the series is very different from the Xaro of the books. Dany’s storyline in Qarth was beautifully written in the books, but it’s not really plot-driven. We needed more for her to be up against in this season before she gets to the House of the Undying, so [we added] the conspiracy between Xaro and Pyat Pree…We made the decision to make [Xaro] an outsider, and that was a very conscious decision that he would not be from Qarth, so he could identify with her right off the bat and she would trust him, because she figures \"He's not of this crowd, either.\" ...I think it's more about the story and what serves it best.\" [11] See also", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T03:21:33.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
