Rooney has failed to hold down a regular first-team place under Jose Mourinho at Manchester United this season \nWhen asked about Rooney's situation, Southgate said: \"Whether it is young players in our system or senior players in our system, the desire is to see English players playing regularly in the biggest possible matches. \n\"The more players that you have available to select, that are playing in games that matter, games for teams that are pushing for the title, games that are cup finals, latter stages of the Champions League, the latter stages of the Europa League, there the games you want your players involved in.
