It's basically kind of a roast of myself, the whole thing,” McHugh said jokingly. “[John] directed it, I'm in it, we wrote it together and we had a lot of fun doing it. Josh Peck helped us out with it too and Brittany Furlan … she’s in it too.” A photo posted by John Stamos (@johnstamos) on Dec 11, 2016 at 6:41pm PST Clearly, blurring personal and professional lines was a positive experience for McHugh. “They say if you can do a film together, you can do anything together,” she explained. “I'm very happy to say we survived the filming process and we're in editing now. We're both still alive so it's great!” The ridiculously good-looking duo has been dating for nearly a year, but have kept private about their relationship. “I'm very happy, he's super supportive, and I really couldn't ask for anything better,” the brunette beauty said. “We like to keep our lives private because we've seen what relationships in the public eye can be like and we just like our privacy.” PHOTOS: John Stamos Can't Keep His Hands Off Girlfriend Caitlin McHugh “We don't want the commentary from the masses about what our relationship is or should be,” she added. “We’re very happy together and we hope to be so for a long time.” So what’s their favorite way to spend a date night? “I like it when he cooks dinner and I eat it!” McHugh said, adding that Stamos’ specialty is chicken and veggies. McHugh also revealed that Stamos has been very supportive of her career, calling his belief in her “priceless.” “He's very encouraging of anything I want to do career-wise,” she explained. “I really appreciate it a lot. You don't get that with every guy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T11:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:24:34.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
