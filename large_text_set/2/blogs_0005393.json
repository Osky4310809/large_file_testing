Stephen Lam / Getty Images, file \nThe Justice Department counters by saying that a federal law explicitly gives the president the authority, in the words of the statute, \"to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\" for national security purposes. \nIn restricting travel for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, President Trump was focusing on countries that Congress and the State Department had already deemed to be \"associated with a heightened risk of terrorism\" and that lack sufficient resources to allow thorough vetting of those wishing to come to the United States.
