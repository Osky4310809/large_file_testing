Do they just not exist? Or do we just not talk about them?\nImgur user whatupcorgibutt (or Kate, as we’ll call her) decided to share her experiences with her now-ex boyfriend to prove that yes, guys can be just as crazy in relationships as women can be.\nIt all started around 1:30 a.m., when he sent her a selfie and then got upset when she didn’t comment on how “hot” he was.\nImgur / whatupcorgibutt Imgur / whatupcorgibutt After a few more messages without any reply, the boyfriend did the only think he could think to do: recommend she visit a mental hospital.\nImgur / whatupcorgibutt Of course, even after what seemed like a final “Byee,” it wasn’t really over. It never really is, is it?\nImgur / whatupcorgibutt Of course, Kate wasn’t really buying it. She wrote: “‘I don’t care about the other girls around me,’ bruh you admitted to me Sunday that you made out with another girl at a club.”\nBut alas, the ex didn’t really consider that and continued his barrage of messages.\nImgur / whatupcorgibutt Woah. Whiplash.\nImgur / whatupcorgibutt Imgur / whatupcorgibutt And then, the final message:\nImgur / whatupcorgibutt Imgur / whatupcorgibutt Um. I’m going to need a minute to process this.\nKate claimed the entire conversation happened within an hour. She explained in the Imgur post that she hadn’t actually been ignoring him — her phone had died, but he had assumed the worst and blew up on her. Needless to say, she dumped him pretty quickly.\n“The reason I’m posting this is because we often see guys post about their crazy exes, but you don’t see many crazy ex boyfriends,” she wrote, like the unintentional feminist queen that she is. All I can say is: y ssss.\nThis just goes to show that it doesn’t matter what your gender is — maybe we’re all just kind of psychotic when it comes to love.
