We first got wind of this huge launch back in December, but haven't heard much more since then. That is, until now. Yesterday, Kattan shared a sneak peek of the foundation in action, catching us all off guard. This sneak peak also comes just weeks after Kattan teased the launch of a new highlighter palette . We can hardly keep up! She began the clip by commenting on her makeup free skin, before adding a bit of foundation. \"Guys look at my skin. But look at it with just a little foundation,\" she says. Then as she applied a bit of foundation of the left side of her face. \"This is our secret foundation. It's launching later, but I just cant help but tease you guys,\" she says. This quick application left her skin instantly flawless, and judging by the video, the foundation provides medium to full coverage. In a video from last year , she names the Tarte Rainforest of the Sea Water Foundation as one of her 2016 faves, so we're guessing this foundation will also be a lightweight formula. Details on the price and release have yet to be provided, but we'll be stalking her IG stories for more clues in the meantime.

Huda Kattan, in particular, posted about some upcoming launches, like Huda Beauty foundation and metallic liquid lipstick, in a story but not on her feed. So if you didn't catch her announcement within the 24-hour story window, well, we have your back. Yesterday, the beauty-blogger-turned-beauty-mogul gave her followers a sneak peek at Huda Beauty Liquid Matte mini kits that are being released next month, and she hinted at a foundation being launched later next year. (Sadly, you won't be able to get the kits in time for the holidays. Think of them as a New Year's treat instead.)
