Don’t go running to the burbs for a house, report says \nIt was perhaps the most somber senior exit in the history of Magness Arena. After an on-ice group picture, the seven seniors on the University of Denver hockey team made the short walk from the Zamboni exit to the locker room. They had just spearheaded a 14th consecutive victory over rival Colorado College, further substantiating the Pioneers’ No. 1 national ranking. \nBut none of the seniors, who had joined the program when coach Jim Montgomery took over, could muster a smile. Playing their final game at Magness Arena on March 11 was a reminder of all they had accomplished in their career, yes, but also how much they’ll miss the man who molded the Pioneers into the favorites to win the NCAA championship this year. The top-ranked and overall No. 1 seed Pioneers (29-7-4) open tournament play Saturday against No. 16 seed Michigan Tech in the Midwest Regional in Cincinnati. \n“We came in with Monty, our class, so it’s bittersweet because we built this program for his liking,” said senior defenseman Will Butcher, the team captain. “We did everything we could to make this program as best as we could. And it comes with the emotion of, ‘We’re not going to be here to experience that anymore with Monty.’” \nMontgomery, 47, was raised in Montreal, captained the Maine Black Bears to an NCAA championship and had a journeyman’s pro career, including 122 games in the NHL. He’s known as a fiery players’ coach who teaches with blue-collar tough love to get machine-like effectiveness. \nHe favors a relentless puck-pressure style that the Pioneers have bought into, advancing deeper into the NCAA Tournament each year he has been at DU. This year, everyone around the program believes, is the Pios’ best chance to win their first national championship since 2005.
