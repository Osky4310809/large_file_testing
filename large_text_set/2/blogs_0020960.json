He tried his best to stand up but got a little bit too far forward and crashed into the bank. \nBUHRER SURE OF KNIGHTS’ SHOCK VALUE Ross spotted Lachlan Auld was in trouble and rushed to his aid. Source: News Corp Australia \n“When I saw him nosedive I knew it didn’t look too good so I kind of waited there for a second and kept eyes on him. I could see he was groggy and the instructor was still a bit too far away so I got to him. \n“I grabbed him and said ‘mate, are you all right?’ and he said ‘I’m dizzy, I’m dizzy’. So I told him just to stay relaxed and helped him upright, got his leg rope off so I was able to push the board away and just focus on him. \n“By the time I got him into waist deep water one of the surf instructors was able to come in and offer some assistance and we got him into shore. He was a good kid, he said he just had a bit of a headache by the end of it.” With the help of Surfest instructors the youngster was taken to safety.

The youngsters taking part weren’t the only ones in need of surf guidance ...

It was just an awesome experience.” \nRoss, Mickey Paea, Ken Sio, Cory Denniss, Jacob Gagan and Chanel Mata’utia were helping launch the Me Unlimited program, which is run by non-for-profit organisation Path 2 Change and is aimed at improving the mental health of homeless or at risk young people through physical activity. Knights players were part of a learn to surf day for homeless and vulnerable kids.
