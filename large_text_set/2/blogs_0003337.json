In fact, the website explicitly says “human activities have contributed substantially to climate change by adding CO2 and other heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere.” \n“These greenhouse gas emissions have increased the greenhouse effect and caused Earth’s surface temperature to rise,” reads EPA website. “The primary human activity affecting the amount and rate of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.” \nWhile the website doesn’t explicitly say “carbon pollution” — a frequently used Obama administration talking point, and also not a scientific term — it has an entire section on carbon dioxide’s impact on the climate. \nSo, what could InsideClimate News referring to? The news site reprinted an article by Climate Central , amplifying concerns of environmental activists that the EPA’s new website no longer mentions former President Obama’s “Climate Action Plan,” including a single reference to “carbon pollution.” \nClimate Central reported “the partnerships page also no longer mentions carbon pollution as a cause of climate change,” and that “[r]emoving the commitment to the United Nations process also came with removing a statement linking greenhouse gas emissions to climate change.” \nClimate Central’s report is really only about one part of EPA.gov that went from being called “Federal Partner Collaboration” to “EPA Adaptation Collaboration.” There’s still plenty of talk about global warming and its human component on the EPA’s website. \nBut you wouldn’t get that impression based on InsideClimate’s tweet. \nSome Twitter users didn’t like InsideClimate’s misleading tweet. @insideclimate @ryanmaue is right about this, headline plain wrong, article by @blkhan is way more specific…you should correct. \n— Jet Burst Icon (@jtrobec) February 3, 2017 @insideclimate There wouldn’t be any life on earth without CO2. Don’t be so utterly ridiculous. \n— Deplorable, Captain (@DavidAHoward) February 4, 2017 @insideclimate CO2 is plant food and essential to life on earth. High levels of NOx is pollution.
