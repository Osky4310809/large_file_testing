He also withdrew the appeal filed against the Bombay High Court judgement refusing to quash the defamation case. \nAfter the withdrawal of the case, the court had summoned Gandhi for further proceedings.   09:32 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T06:56:40.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
