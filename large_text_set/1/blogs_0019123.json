In other words, you and your family across the country can listen to the same song at the exact same time using the app. \nTo avoid legal snares around public performance and distribution, Vertigo connects in to users’ Spotify accounts and merely activates songs that those users already have a right to listen to. \nYou can see how this would be useful for long-distance relationships and flash mob practice, but founder Greg Leekley sees opportunities in daily life for young millennials and Gen Z. \n“The young demographic doesn’t separate what happens in their virtual lives from what happens in the real world,” said Leekley. “And when we asked them, they were more interested in hearing songs that their friends were listening to than celebrities.” \nLeekley said that Snapchat’s success comes from the same phenomenon of young users wanting to experience each other in real time. \nAlongside listening to music together, Vertigo also lets users overlay their music session with text, video, pictures and drawings, offering a more lean-forward experience for users. \nFor now, Vertigo has signed on Spotify as a platform but hopes to get other platforms (like Apple Music) on board soon. \nVertigo has raised upwards of $10 million. \nYou can find the app here . screen696x696", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T17:26:29.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
