Claudio Ranieri is fired by Leicester The Italian isn't the first boss to be given the boot despite bringing huge success to his club Share Claudio Ranieri has lost his job just months after winning the Premier League (Photo: Getty) Share Get football updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe \nThe news Claudio Ranieri has been sacked by Leicester has shocked fans and pundits alike. \nJust nine months after he guided the Foxes to the most unlikely league title in English football history, the firing of the Italian has been been described as \"inexplicable\" and \"unforgivable\" by Gary Lineker. \nHowever, Ranieri isn't the first Premier League boss to suffer a harsh sacking at the hands of his employers. \nHere are a few of the top flight's most brutal ever sackings: Roberto Di Matteo was sacked five months after winning a Champions League and FA Cup double (Photo: Getty) Roberto Di Matteo (Chelsea, November 2012) \nNot only was Roberto Di Matteo a Chelsea legend, the Italian guided the Blues to a first Champions League title as well as winning the FA Cup before being sacked after just eight months in charge. \nDi Matteo took over from Andre Villas-Boas as caretaker boss in March 2012, promoted from his role of assistant to the Portuguese coach and turned things around dramatically at Stamford Bridge. \nHighlights of his caretaker reign included beating Barcelona over two legs in the Champions League semi-finals and a 5-1 FA Cup semi-final win over Tottenham before beating Liverpool in the final.

Chris Hughton lost his job with Newcastle 11th in the Premier League after winning the Championship (Photo: PA) Chris Hughton (Newcastle, December 2010) \nFormer Tottenham defender Chris Hughton took over at St James' park in a time of crises and helped them win the Championship, only to be sacked the following season with his side sitting safely in 11th place. \nThe Magpies had managed memorable victories that season, including a 1-0 win away at Arsenal and an impressive 5-1 thrashing of rivals Sunderland. \nBut controversial owner Mike Ashley elected to replace him with Alan Pardew after a 3-1 defeat at West Brom in December 2010, to the fury of fans who held protests. Young Southampton fans show off a mask in support of former manager Nigel Adkins (Photo: Getty) Nigel Adkins (Southampton, January 2013) \nNigel Adkins took Southampton from League One to the Premier League and had Saints three points above the relegation zone when he was replaced by Mauricio Pochettino. \nchairman Nicola Cortese said at the time : \"This decision has been made with the long-term ambitions of Southampton Football Club in mind. \n\"Whilst we acknowledge the contribution Nigel has made during the past two years, for the club to progress and achieve our long-term targets a change was needed.\" \nAdkins ended up taking the club to court for breach of contract. Carlo Ancelotti got the boot after finishing second the year after a league and FA Cup double (Photo: PA) Carlo Ancelotti (Chelsea, May 2011) \nSensing a theme here with the blues? Carlo Ancelotti was dismissed by Chelsea after finishing second in the Premier League, a year after winning a Premier League and FA Cup double. \nThe club said: \"This season's performances have fallen short of expectations and the club feels the time is right to make this change ahead of next season's preparations.\" \nThe Italian went on to win Ligue 1 at Paris Saint-Germain and the Champions League with Real Madrd in the next three seasons. Avram Grant was two points off the Premier League title and lost the Champions League final on penalties - SACKED Avram Grant (Chelsea, May 2008) \nChelsea again, and a similar story to Ancelotti. \nAvram Grant might not have won anything at Chelsea but he came about as close as you can. \nIn 2008 the Blues finished runners-up in the League Cup to Tottenham, finished two points behind Manchester United in the Premier League and lost on penalties to the Reds in the Champions League final. \nSecond just isn't good enough for Roman Abramovic, and he was dismissed at the end of the season. Harry Redknapp led Spurs to fourth for the second time in three seasons (Photo: Michael Regan) Harry Redknapp (Tottenham, June 2013) \nThe veteran wheeler-dealer's dismissal at Spurs may not have been for purely football reasons, but it's hard to argue he wasn't doing a thoroughly good job. \nA second fourth-placed finish in three years saw Tottenham miss out on the Champions League due to Chelsea winning the competition, but Redknapp had taken them to Europe's top table the season before with an impressive victory over Inter Milan in Italy before being eliminated at the quarter-final stage. \nHe had looked set to leave Spurs on his own terms as England beckoned, but after some tax issues that door closed and he was sacked by the White Hart Lane club in June after failing to agree a new deal. Ranieri lost his job at Chelsea nearly 13 years ago after finishing second (Photo: Action Images) Claudio Ranieri (Chelsea, June 2004) \nYes, this wouldn't be the first harsh sacking Claudio Ranieri has been subjected to should Leicester pull the trigger. \nThe Italian was ousted at Chelsea by owner Abramovich despite guiding Chelsea to their highest ever Premier League finish of second, behind Arsenal's invincibles. \nNevertheless Jose Mourinho was lined up after his remarkable Champions League win with Porto. \n\"Claudio has done a first class job for the club and paved the way for future success,\" the club's statement read. poll loading Were Leicester City right to sack Claudio Ranieri? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:34:01.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
