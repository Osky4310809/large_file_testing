We had some preliminary discussions last year about that but in the end we've agreed what each party does in each electorate is up to them. \n\"So there 's no agreement in any particular electorate in terms of what parties might stand what candidates,\" he said. \nAt the time the MOU was announced, Turei said it would provide \"crystal clear clarity\" that was lacking in the last two elections about an alternative government. \nIt included an agreement to co-operate in Parliament and investigate a joint policy and/or campaign. \nLittle said Grant Robertson would be finance minister in a Labour-Green government but no other discussions had been held over other roles. \nTurei said the shape of a Cabinet would come much further down the track, after the election. \nNational Party minister Steven Joyce said at the time the announcement was no surprise. \n\"This is a memorandum of understanding, which seems to have lot of get-out weasel-words in it ... I just don't think it's particularly big news they're going to campaign together.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:49:12.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
