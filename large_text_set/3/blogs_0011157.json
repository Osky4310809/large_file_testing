WOOBI offers a solution to improve the living conditions of these kids around the world. this project is a bold shot at designing a simple, new typology that transforms a professional, protective mask to fit into a child’s universe.’ martin hislop I designboom", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:12:09.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
