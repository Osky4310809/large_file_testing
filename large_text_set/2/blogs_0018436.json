Jade had to hold her gown down (Photo: PA) Jade flashed more than a little leg in the risky outfit (Photo: PA) \nJade was forced to hold down the front of her dress thanks to the sky-high thigh slip that risked giving her a major Marilyn Monroe moment in front of the paparazzi. \nShe was quickly followed by the rest of her bandmates, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson, who all looked gorgeous in similar red carpet ensembles ahead of their big performance. \nFans in the UK can watch all the action on ITV with an exclusive broadcast, while Clara Amfo, Laura Jackson and Alice Levine will host live from the red carpet and backstage either side of the main show on ITV2. Jade was joined by her band mates on the red carpet (Photo: Rex Features) \nHowever, that's not all - the BRITs will also air live on YouTube at 7.30pm, which will be fronted by the platform's presenter-in-chief Casper Lee. \nGeoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI & BRIT Awards said: \"We are always looking for ways for The BRITs to reach as wide an audience as possible given the global interest and huge international artists taking part in the show. The band are performing tonight (Photo: Getty Images North America) \n\"It’s really exciting for us that so many people around the world will get the chance to celebrate the UK’s biggest night in music live as it happens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:52:26.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
