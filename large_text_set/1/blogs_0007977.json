Image: INQUIRER.net \nMany are anticipating the Nintendo Switch, especially with the promise of being able to feature triple-A games on the go. But one game in particular would make many fans very happy if it appears on the Switch, and that’s Pokémon. \nA NeoGAF user recently spotted that the GameSpot description for the Nintendo Switch mentioned Pokémon as part of the game lineup, reports TechRadar. \nThe description read, “Nintendo Switch games will include new title offerings from Mario, Splatoon, Zelda, the NBA and more! You will even be able to play Skyrim on the go, or Pokémon at home with the Nintendo Switch.” ADVERTISEMENT \nThe description has long been amended and it is unclear if it was an accidental leak or simply a mistake on the word of choice for the copywriter. \nMore details about the Switch should be revealed soon when Nintendo’s big event for the console kicks off on January 12.
