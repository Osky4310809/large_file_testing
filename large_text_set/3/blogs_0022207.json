Their daughter, Sharon Bradley, said it was “fantastic” news but was not available to comment further. \nSupporting documentation requested by the department had been due on Wednesday, but it was not known when a decision was due. \nThe decision concludes a decade-long process for the couple, who applied for permanent residency under the aged parent visa scheme after arriving in Sydney in 2007. \nThe visa allows older parents live in Australia if their child is a citizen or permanent resident, but can take up to 30 years to be granted. \nAfter seven years on the waiting list, the Bradleys were told they were approaching the front of the queue. But James Bradley, then in his late 80s and less mobile following a fall, failed his second medical examination and was refused a visa. \nThat decision was upheld by an administrative tribunal. As James and Peggie had made a joint application, both faced being deported back to England but were hopeful that global media attention they had received since Sunday would help make their case with the minister. \nHawke has been invited to comment on his decision by Guardian Australia.
