Yet thanks to a state-of-the-art exoskeleton, the man who goes by “therickles” recently walked 826 steps in a therapy session and posted the awesome picture above as proof. The Indego exoskeleton in the post uses a backpack-mounted apparatus to power a 26-pound machine that’s controlled by the user’s leaning movements. \nTherickles’ post was so popular that he did a follow-up “Ask Me Anything,” in which he heralded questions from across the world about his new kit. Using the usernames of inquisitive Redditors, Men’s Health curated the following Q&A with the man behind the exoskeleton to explore the growing world of possibilities for people living with spinal cord injuries.

When I went to use it the trial was already over but they decided to use it as physical therapy anyways. \nUser A1-Broscientist : What exactly does your physical therapy consist of? Is your therapist just there to make sure you don’t fall or is she actively teaching you how to use that cool ass exoskeleton? \nTherickles : Therapy consists of a lot of strengthening what I do have and also maintaining what I don’t. Ordinarily I do physical therapy in Baltimore at Kennedy Krieger Institute but I’m doing it now in Richmond as a test run in case I get into VCU. The exoskeleton is good because it’s good for my bones by weight bearing. I also use a FES bike for my legs. I attach electrodes to my muscles and it fires as I ride the bike. This helps keep my legs from atrophying and it is good cardio. \nUser Annshine : What’s the realistic goal and the dream goal for you in using the exoskeleton? \nTherickles : I’m like Forrest Gump. I just like walking. \nUser SeabearsAttack : This may sound dumb, but where do you see yourself in 10-25 years? Do you think technology will make your quality of life significantly better? What type of things do you see yourself wanting to do? \nTherickles : I don't know where I'll be in the future but I do hope I'm walking. I do think technology will do something amazing. Some things that I would love to do would be something space related. I love science in space. Maybe working at a telescope or something? I also like to give standup comedy try. I'm also trying to learn voice acting so I'd like to see if that would get me anywhere. \nUser RHeegaard : Assuming you can use the exoskeleton, would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck? \nTherickles : One horse-sized duck. Then find a way to domesticate it and give it to my brother. He loves ducks. \nUser Novazilla : Just how close are we to having an Ironman suit? \nTherickles : That information is classified.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:39:59.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
