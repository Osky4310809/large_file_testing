And this was, of course, quite upsetting for the actress. Also, the film itself was a departure from typical the Bollywood fare, so the actress may not have been able to live out her romantic Hindi film fantasy with Shah Rukh Khan. But, a recent video that she put up on Instagram, fully shows off her filmy keeda , with her twirling in a gloriously golden sarson ka khet . While we're wishing the video featured SRK to add to the feels, we're loving Mahira enacting a typical romantic Bollywood film trope.
