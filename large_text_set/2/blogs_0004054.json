The venture was revealed on Monday with support from Ireland’s Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation through IDA Ireland and intends to create at least 140 jobs in the next three years. \nBoth partners also continue their own TV and film operations. Mercury Filmworks’ projects have included Disney’s Tangled animated series, Mickey Mouse Shorts, Wander Over Yonder , as well as the upcoming Netflix original series Hilda. \nCartoon Saloon was founded by Tomm Moore, who directed The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea ; Paul Young and Nora Twomey. Its next feature, Twomey-directed The Breadwinner, is being co-produced with Canada’s Aircraft Pictures, Luxembourg’s Melusine Productions and in association with Angelina Jolie’s Jolie Pas Productions. It will be released by GKids later this year. \n“Together, we plan to make Lighthouse Studios and Kilkenny a center of excellence for animation,” said Cartoon Saloon’s CEO Paul Young in a statement. “Ireland enjoys a number of advantages when it comes to animation. The industry is supported by a growing number of educational programs and draws talent from all over Europe. ... The Irish talent pool has been spilling over into other parts of Europe and North America for years and we look forward to welcoming a lot of that talent home.” Carolyn Giardina", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:06:23.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
