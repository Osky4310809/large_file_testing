Elena Anaya already revealed she’s one of the villains, and we thought she could be Doctor Poison working for a more recognizable villain. Early rumors about the film claimed those bigger villains would be Ares and Circe. We didn’t hear about those rumors again for a long time, although we did wonder if Danny Huston’s German soldier might be Ares in disguise:\nWarner\n\nNow the old rumor has partly circled back again in French publication Studio Ciné Live ‘s interview with the cast and crew. There was no mention of Circe, but Ares is apparently the main villain after all (although we still don’t know which actor is playing him). Les Toiles Héroïques (via Comic Book ) offers a translation:\n“Behind these scientific formulas, there is a deadly gas that could well annihilate humanity. Now, it turns out that this is precisely the goal of Ares, the god of war. He is jealous of humanity, which is a creation of his father, the deceased Zeus (he was killed by Ares when he rebelled against him, with the help of the Amazons)…”\nIn addition to the big reveal of the villain and his motive, we also learned how Chris Pine’s character (Steve Trevor) ended up on Themyscira. Pine told Studio Ciné Live , “I play a pilot who works for the Allies and spies on the Germans without their knowledge. My character steals a notebook filled with scientific formulas in an Ottoman base, he steals a plane but is shot down in the open sea.”\nListen all y’all, that’s a sabotage.\n(Via Studio Ciné Live , Les Toiles Héroïques , and Comic Book )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T14:01:08.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
