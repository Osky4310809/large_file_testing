Kofi Outlaw Back to Article Image of \nSupergirl 's most recent episode, \"Exodus\", had a few character shakeups in store for fans - maybe even more than we initially thought! \nWhat at first seemed like a dramatic piece of dialogue spoken by a pivotal character, may actually have been a subtle tease for a villain from Superman comic books, who could be headed to Supergirl soon. Needless to say: \nDo NOT Read Any Further Unless You Are Caught Up on Supergirl ! \nThe main plotline of \"Exodus\" involved Team Supergirl's race against time to stop Cadmus from using the intel that Jeremiah Danvers (Dean Cain) stole from the D.E.O. - a list that allows the clandestine organization from rounding up aliens for forced departure from Earth. \nOf course, Lilian Luther is the true culprit behind the plan - and just before the climatic battle to stop a spacecraft carrying alien prisoners, Lilian had a specific quote to share - one taken from Nietzsche's theory of the Ãœbermensch, or the \"Overman,\" aka the \"Superman.\" The quote basically sums up the theory that mankind's purpose on earth is to become the perfect being, and that the theory of other-worldly ascension (like in religion) were old, destructive notions. \nThe key here is that there is an \"Overman\" in DC Comics mythos: Kal-L of Earth-10 becomes \"Overman\" rather than \"Superman,\" after his rocket from Krypton landed in the hands of the Nazis in the early days of WWII. Overman led the JLAxis, helping his fellow Supermen maintain control over the world. \nThe theory is that Supergirl picked that Nietzsche quote on purpose, as a tease of a future episode where Overman makes an appearance. It remains to be seen whether that Overman is from another Earth; is Tyler Hoechlin's Superman under mental control; a clone; or another character entirely who takes on the name. What's interesting about Overaman is that he has a \"cousin,\" Overgirl, in the comics; could Supergirl find herself wearing that dark, evil, uniform somewhere down the road?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:45:31.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
