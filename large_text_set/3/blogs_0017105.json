The latest incentive is in the central Aichi Prefecture, where a company that runs 89 funeral homes is offering a 15% discount for those who give up their licences, Kyodo news service reports . \nAnyone wanting to take advantage of it has to provide evidence that they have handed in their licence at the local police station, which is supporting the initiative. The discount can be extended to family members, including those who live outside the prefecture, the report says. \nIn 2015, there were almost 4.8 million licence holders over the age of 75, according to The Japan Times , twice as many as a decade earlier. The same period saw an increase in the number of fatal collisions involving elderly drivers. \nSimilar incentive-based schemes are operating elsewhere in Japan, although most aren't quite so morbid - some involve cheaper taxi rides or cut-price entry to public baths. The funeral home initiative is also quite a contrast to another offer announced in Aichi in November, whereby elderly locals could tuck into cut-price noodles if they surrendered their driving licences. \nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter .
