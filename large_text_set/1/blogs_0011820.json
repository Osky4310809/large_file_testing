It probably should be though, because it was built for Windows 10 and includes a bunch of great new tricks that other browsers don’t have. No matter what your experiences with the old Internet Explorer was like, Edge is still worth a look. Here are 5 reasons to give Microsoft’s new browser another chance.\n1) It supports touchscreen gestures \nImage: Mario Aguilar/Gizmodo It’s not all been smooth sailing since Microsoft decided to make Windows an OS that could run on computers and tablets alike, but it’s starting to pay dividends now if the rash of weird and wonderful 2-in-1 devices hitting the computer market are anything to go by.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nWith the arrival of the Anniversary Update , you can get all touchy-feely with Edge in a way that doesn’t really apply to other browsers. If you’re on a touchscreen PC or tablet device, drag your finger left or right to go to the previous or next page in your browsing history.\n2) Sharing pages is more straightforward \nImage: Screenshot Sharing an article you’ve found on the web often requires hunting around for tiny social media icons down the side of the page, but in Edge it’s very straightforward. Just click the rather odd-looking Share button at the top, which is three dots joined by a circular line.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe options you see sliding in from the right-hand side of the screen will vary depending on the applications you’ve got installed in Windows 10, but you should see plenty of the usual suspects like Facebook and Twitter, as well as a few less obvious sharing choices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T16:27:34.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
