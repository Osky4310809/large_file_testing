There was a huge discourse over Mira’s comments as she said her daughter was not a puppy , and she would like to allot her time to see her grow up, instead of rushing off to work. \nSocial media was outraged as Mira comes from a place of privilege and can afford being a stay-at-home mom, unlike many other women who are bread winners of the family. Long story short, Mira’s comments did not go down well with a majority. \nRecently, when Shahid Kapoor was asked for his take on Mira’s comments, he defended her and told Indian Express : \nMira started the conversation by saying that these are her personal comments. I don’t think she made a direct comment on anybody or any category of women. I think she was saying from a very personal standpoint. Mira is speaking for a section of women who really aren’t being represented. There are times when those women feel like they shouldn’t be celebrated and by that I mean women who might not be doing a job, who ight choose to stay at home, have a baby and take care of that baby and consider that something important enough to do at a certain stage in your life. He further addressed the social media outrage that followed: \nI understand people have a strong point of view and they can get hurt about things but I think we are in a time where everybody is getting hurt about everything. I, honestly, don’t think it makes sense to keep everybody happy. We are also in a time where if anybody, who is important or is being given importance, says something, a lot of people want to gain importance by saying something against them. And showed full support towards his wifey by saying: \nI am very proud of what she said. She did a great job. I think this is what it means to be a celebrity. Now, she will have to get used to a little bit of criticism. She is a strong girl, she takes it with a pinch of salt. I think, she will be good. \nYour thoughts?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:05:04.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
