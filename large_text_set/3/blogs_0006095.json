She looks for the gold in every situation. \nShe endures pain, yet finds pleasure in the trauma. She’s experienced heartache, yet finds the diamond in every piece of her heart as she puts it back together. She needs no one, yet wants everyone. She feels deeply and shows gratitude. \nShe looks for balance, and she tries—with all her might—to take the highs with the lows, the good with the bad, and the pain with the joy. \nThrough being strong, she’s discovered what she wants and will pull out all the stops to get it. She’s also discovered this can cause her pain in the moment. If she stops to feel, it propels her forward. If she moves more quickly, it catches up with her and pulls her down. \nShe gives in to vulnerability when she needs to, yet she takes the time to acknowledge that it is necessary. When she feels it, the whole world knows. \nShe strives to be authentic at all times, and this can be one of her many blessings, but it can also be her curse, for people can take advantage of her honesty. \nShe can be quiet, but never still. Remember the saying “still waters run deep”? This is the mind of a strong woman. She may be quiet, but she is always thinking about how she can show up better in the world. She wonders how she can serve—how she can support—and this can drain her energy and leave nothing for herself. \nShe loves emotional intimacy. She loves to share her deepest, darkest fears with the people she trusts—and she expects them to share in return. She can, at times, forget that not all people are like her. \nShe fears nothing, yet hides from the crowd to simply observe the landscape. She will emerge when the time is right. For some, this may be never. She becomes the world’s best-kept secret. \nShe has an innate ability to seek out the truth, which means she is not tolerant of lies. She will call you out, not for hurting her, but for lying to her. She opens herself to being hurt, but the truth is—you cannot pull her down. \nShe is creative and brave, but also cautious about who she shares herself with. Not because she doesn’t trust, but because she’s like a ball of fire when she gets going. \nShe pushes you to be your best, but her intentions can be misunderstood. She might be accused of not caring—of being selfish or cold—but she just wants to show you the way. \nShe has high standards for herself and doesn’t always understand why everyone else doesn’t. She is a warrior, so going into battle never worries her. She comes from a place of love and gratitude for all humankind. She keeps her standards high to help raise the vibration of the planet. Her purpose is lost on many, but she still plows on. \nShe knows her flaws, and she works on them. She sees them as stepping stones toward her ultimate goal of emotional freedom. \nShe requires space, but not isolation, to be who she is—to love and endure the beauty of life. She wants to experience all the highs and lows, not alone, but with a kindred spirit. When she retreats, she is looking for grace—not solitude. \nIf you can relate to this strong woman, you are not alone. You are among the few, but connected to many. \nBe strong. Be courageous. Be bold. \nThe world needs you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:44:58.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
