PUBLISHED: 18:55, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 | UPDATED: 19:29, Tue, Feb 28, 2017 GETTY Leicester are interested in making Roy Hodgson their new manager \nThe MailOnline claim the former England boss held secret talks with Leicester representatives last Friday in south-west London following Claudio Ranieri's controversial sacking. \nIt is claimed the 69-year-old is admired as a long-term successor to Ranieri by Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. \nHodgson is said to be interested in a return to management following his stint with England and Srivaddhanaprabha apparently sees him as the man to turn Leicester's disastrous season around. GETTY Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha views Roy Hodgson as a long term successor to Claudio Ranieri \nHowever, Hodgson is not entirely convinced by the idea of taking over at the King Power Stadium. \nBut the Leicester owner is keen to get him on board and is likely to hold further talks in the coming days and weeks with Hodgson in a bid to convince him to take the reins. \nCraig Shakespeare is likely to remain in interim charge after guiding Leicester to an emphatic 3-1 win over Liverpool last night, but he could just be keeping the seat warm for the arrival of Hodgson.
