The health ministry had earlier put the death toll at 16, which included 15 people on the ground, of whom 6 are children. \nIt was not immediately clear how many people were on board the aircraft when it went down, though a Boeing 747 cargo plane typically carries a crew of at least two people. Turkish Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for information. \nRT reports that among those killed are three crew members, RIA Novosti news agency reported. One of the crew members survived the crash, the local Emergencies Ministry said , as cited by TASS. \nMembers of the Kyrgyzstan government, including Vice prime minister Mukhammetkaliy Abulgaziev, are at the scene, according to reports. \nAll flights to and from Kyrgyzstanâ€™s Manas airport have been suspended until further notice, RIA Novosti reported, citing local sources.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T06:27:30.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
