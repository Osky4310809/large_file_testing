It’s an especially impressive feat because this year he was seemingly fueled only by love from his homeland, Georgia. Gone are the Vine teens and Wyclef Jean of yesteryear . This is how the votes shook out in his category: Western Conference \n1 Kevin Durant (GS) 541,209 \n2 Zaza Pachulia (GS) 439,675 \n3 Kawhi Leonard (SA) 341,240 \n4 Anthony Davis (NO) 318,144 \n5 Draymond Green (GS) 236,315 \n6 DeMarcus Cousins (SAC) 202,317 \n7 Karl-Anthony Towns (MIN) 125,278 \n8 LaMarcus Aldridge (SA) 101,724 \n9 Blake Griffin (LAC) 100,524 \n10 Marc Gasol (MEM) 97,370 \nDespite the passion of his Central Asian countrymen, Pachulia will not become an All-Star, because the final All-Star selections are not left completely up to the will of the people. Fan voting accounts for 50 percent of the final result, while the media voting and player voting are weighted 25 percent each. Unless journalists and Zaza’s colleagues stick up for him, he’ll be snubbed for the 14th year running.
