With Rabada taking 10 for 92, the match was wrapped up by lunch on Thursday (January 5), but to say that he put Sri Lanka out of their misery would not be quite right. The tourists will likely spend the next week pouring over the list of poor shots that brought about their downfall here. \nAs in the first innings, when Sri Lanka were bowled out for 110, the batsmen had themselves to blame more than good bowling or a tricky pitch. Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal had shown the way forward by batting out the final hour of the third day, but on the fourth morning, Chandimal's tame dismissal set an example that too many of his teammates followed. \nSri Lanka had added just 14 runs to their overnight score of 130 for four when the wicketkeeper-batsman flicked a full delivery from Rabada straight to square-leg to depart for 30, sparking another procession. In the fast bowler's next over an ill-judged cut shot saw Upul Tharanga edge behind, and a loose stroke from Mathews yielded a similar dismissal, with the Sri Lankan captain falling one run short of his half-century. \nRabada already had two wickets from day three, and four from the first innings, so when Suranga Lakmal became his next victim, the 21-year-old had 10 in the match. Rabada's hero, Dale Steyn, has taken five 10-wicket hauls in 85 Tests, yet he has now achieved the feat twice in 13 matches, taking 58 wickets at an average of 22 overall. \nSuch a bright future needs to be protected, of course, and so Rabada was taken off after starting the day with a seven-over spell, leaving him with figures of 6 for 55 in the second innings. That left the final two Sri Lankan wickets up for grabs, and after a freewheeling stand of 33 between Rangana Herath and Lahiru Kumara, Keshav Maharaj grabbed the first when he flighted one up, and Kumara stepped down the pitch to be smartly stumped by Quinton de Kock. \nHerath battled on, more with the intention of providing some entertainment than anything else, but it was not long before Nuwan Pradeep had a swing at Vernon Philander and saw his off-stump knocked back. South Africa huddled in the center of the pitch, sharing a moment upon clinching the series. They continue to produce high standards, even without Dale Steyn and AB de Villiers in their side, but there are rocky times ahead as an increasing number of players look to England and Kolpak deals. In that moment, though, Faf du Plessis could make sure that they enjoyed this victory. \nBrief scores: South Africa 392 (Dean Elgar 129; Lahiru Kumara 6-122) & 224/7 (Dean Elgar 55; Suranga Lakmal 4-69) beat Sri Lanka 110 (Upul Tharanga 26*; Vernon Philander 4-27, Kagiso Rabada 4-37) & 224 (Angelo Mathews 49; Kagiso Rabada 6-55, Vernon Philander 3-48) by 282 runs. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T13:20:09.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
