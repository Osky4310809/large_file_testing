Monaco vs Real Madrid, 2004 (Photo: REUTERS) \nFirst leg: Real Madrid 4-2 Monaco \nSecond leg: Monaco 3-1 Real Madrid \nReal Madrid, leading 4-2 from the first leg, looked certain to reach the semi-finals when club legend Raul scored in Monaco to give them a 5-2 aggregate lead. Ten minutes later, though, Ludovic Guily gave the Ligue 1 side hope. \nFernando Morientes — on loan from Real Madrid — then powered home a magnificent header before Guily struck again to send Monaco through on away goals. Deportivo vs AC Milan, 2004 (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nFirst leg: AC Milan 4-1 Deportivo \nSecond leg: Deportivo 4-0 AC Milan \nReigning European champions AC Milan demolished Deportivo in the first leg of their 2004 encounter. The Italians scored four goals in eight minutes to seemingly end Depor's qualification hopes. \nQualify they did, however. Goals from Walter Pandiani, Juan Carlos Valeron and Albert Luque wiped out Milan's lead before half time. Substitute Gonzalez Fran then made it 5-4 on aggregate in the 76th minute to complete an unforgettable fightback. Chelsea vs Napoli, 2012 \nFirst leg: Napoli 3-1 Chelsea \nSecond leg: Chelsea 4-1 Napoli (aet) \nAndre Villas-Boas was in charge for Chelsea's 3-1 defeat at Napoli in 2012 but was out of a job two weeks later following a defeat at West Brom. Roman Abramovich named Roberto Di Matteo as his replacement in what proved to be an inspired decision. \nDidier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard sent the second leg to extra time before Branislav Ivanovic netted the winner in the 105th minute. From Chelsea's lowest point in the season came the catalyst for them to become London's first Champions League winning club. AC Milan vs Liverpool, 2005 Xabi Alonso scores the third goal for Liverpool (Photo: Getty) \nHalf time: AC Milan 3-0 Liverpool \nFull time: AC Milan 3-3 Liverpool (2-3 on pens) \nLiverpool were so far behind at half time of the 2005 final that some of Liverpool's travelling fans decided they had seen enough. Those that did missed arguably the greatest comeback in Champions League history. \nSteven Gerrard, Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso scored in six second-half minutes and Rafa Benitez's Liverpool then won 3-2 on penalties. Manchester United vs Bayern Munich, 1999 (Photo: Getty Images) \n90th minute: Manchester United 0-1 Bayern Munich \nFull time: Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich \nMario Basler struck in the sixth minute of the 1999 Champions League final to give Bayern Munich the lead. When the fourth official's board went up to indicate three minutes of added time at the end of normal time, United were still behind. \nWhat followed, though, is considered the greatest comeback in United's history. Teddy Sheringham scored a 91st-minute equaliser before Ole Gunnar Solskjaer netted the winner in the final seconds of the game.
