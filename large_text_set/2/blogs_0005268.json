Giphy \nWell, stopping by the ole Super Bowl on Sunday were none other than the Schuyler sisters. That’s right, I’m talking about Angelica, Eliza and Peggy. \nOf course, you may know them by their actual actor names Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones, the threesome who originated the roles on Broadway. \nThe three of them sang “America the Beautiful,” and see if you can notice any noticeable difference in the lyrics. \nI’ve got to say this rendition worked, worked. Why? Because the trio added “and sisterhood” to the lyrics. They sang, \nAnd crown thy good with brotherhood — and sisterhood — from sea to shining sea. \nHeck. Fucking. Yes. Preach, Schuyler Sisters, preach. Giphy \nIt’s about goddamn time we officially add “and sisterhood” to this song for good, don’t you agree? \nI mean, I think if a majority of Americans would have had their way, we would currently be enjoying the first female president instead of the nightmare for democracy known as Donald Trump. As a result, #AndSisterhood started to trend. “Hamilton” creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda tweeted his approval.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:48:56.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
