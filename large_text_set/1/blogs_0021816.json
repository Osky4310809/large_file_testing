REUTERS/Brian Snyder 5438983 \nPresident Donald Trump has created a national day of patriotism, but it has already come and gone. \nBy presidential proclamation, Trump officially declared the day of his inauguration a “national day of patriotic devotion,” according to a document released Monday by the Office of the Federal Registrar. \n“A new national pride stirs the American soul and inspires the American heart. We are one people, united by a common destiny and a shared purpose,” the proclamation read. \n“Freedom is the birthright of all Americans, and to preserve that freedom we must maintain faith in our sacred values and heritage,” the document continued. “Our Constitution is written on parchment, but it lives in the hearts of the American people.” \n“There is no freedom where the people do not believe in it; no law where the people do not follow it; and no peace where the people do not pray for it,” it read. \n“I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2017, as National Day of Patriotic Devotion, in order to strengthen our bonds to each other and to our country — and to renew the duties of Government to the people,” the proclamation concluded. \nFollowing his inauguration Friday, the president signed a proclamation on the Senate floor establishing a national day of patriotism, White House Secretary Sean Spicer revealed on Twitter. \nIt was unclear at the time that Trump intended to declare the day he became the president a day for patriotic reflection. \nThe language of the proclamation resembles the wording of Trump’s inaugural address. \n“At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,” Trump stated , standing on the Capitol steps. \nThe core of Trump’s policies is “America first.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:54:03.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
