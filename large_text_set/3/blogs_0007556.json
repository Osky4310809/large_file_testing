They will play the winner of Florida State vs. Notre Dame on Saturday.\nIt took a huge second half comeback for the Blue Devils to surge back against UNC, who led 61-48 with 14 minutes left in the third quarter after a Kennedy Meeks layup. From that moment forward, Duke’s offense came to life, with Jayson Tatum scoring 24 points and Luke Kennard dropping 20 on just seven shots.\nNorth Carolina built their first half lead off strong play from Meeks , Isaiah Hicks and Justin Jackson. They led 49-42 at halftime, before building that lead to 13 early in the second half. After that, Duke dominated the rest of the way.\nNo one has ever won four straight games to take the ACC tournament title, like Duke is poised to do with one more win. Tatum and Luke Kennard’s late season surges has made them a more dangerous team than their record suggested, and they beat Clemson on Wednesday and nationally ranked No. 10 Louisville by four points on Thursday.
