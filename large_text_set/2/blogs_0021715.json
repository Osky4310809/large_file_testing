Our parents who have been married for 40-some-odd years? Old couples in Facebook videos who suffer from memory loss and fall in love every day regardless? \nDon’t make me laugh. \nThankfully, it looks like former stripper Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum ’s relationship is still going strong after all these years.

She said, \nIt was two nights of being weird. We hadn’t even kissed. And then he went out partying with a bunch of dancers. His room was right above mine, and he came down drunk with a sombrero on, banging on my door. \nHe was like, ‘I couldn’t stop thinking about you. Let’s do this. I just want to be with you.’ From that point forward, we were together. \nBe. Still. My. Heart. I’m. Hardly. Breathing.
