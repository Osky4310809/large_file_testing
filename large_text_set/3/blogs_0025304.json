Six teams are essentially vying for four spots, and they’re separated by 3.5 games. Those six teams are the Atlanta Hawks, Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, and the Bucks, Pacers and Pistons. \nThe Heat are in the No. 8 seed after beginning the season 11-30. If they were to make the postseason, it would mark the worst start to any NBA season that yielded a playoff berth. The Heat, who finish the regular season with seven of their remaining 10 games against teams fighting for the playoffs, could find themselves in a first-round matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Coincidentally, the Heat have won two of three vs. the defending champions this season. Better yet, the Heat own tiebreakers over the Pacers and the Bucks should it come to that. \nMore NBA news: Atlanta Hawks staying positive in midst of five-game skid \nThe Heat are on the right side of the cut line, but hardly anything is settled as far up as the No. 5 seed, tenuously occupied by the Atlanta Hawks, who face the Bucks on Friday night. Milwaukee is 10-2 since March 3rd and has a realistic chance of overtaking the Hawks for the No. 5 seed. \n“Dwelling on what’s negative isn’t going to bring anything good out of it,” Hawks forward Thabo Sefolosha said after their eighth loss in 11 games on Wednesday. “We’ve got to be able to be honest with one another and tell each other about what we see, but after a game like this, be positive.” \nThe Hawks and the Bucks are relatively safe, but teams like the Pacers, Bulls and Pistons are anything but. \nIt doesn’t seem to matter how much Paul George contributes; the Pacers, a game ahead of the Heat for the seventh seed, are mired in mediocrity. Indiana has set a franchise record of 15 straight games for alternating wins and losses. The NBA record is 16. If the standings hold, the Pacers could find themselves facing the Boston Celtics in the first round. The Celtics, however, trail the Cavs by just one game for the top seed with an April 5 matchup looming. \nMore NBA: 76ers' Joel Embiid to have surgery on torn meniscus 'in the coming days' \n“This was a very winnable game,” George said after Wednesday’s loss to the Celtics. “Everybody at this point in the season is giving all they’ve got. It’s just that point in the season where it’s no excuses, no finger pointing. We’re just not getting it done.” \nThe Bulls and Pistons would gladly trade positions with any of the teams currently looking down at them in the standings. The Bulls have lost nine of 13 since Feb. 28. They also lost guard Dwyane Wade for the remainder of the regular season due to a minor fracture in his elbow. Fortunately, the Bulls own the tiebreaker over the Heat (by virtue of winning the season series 2-1). Whether they’ll take advantage of an easy remaining schedule remains another matter. \nThe Pistons remain on the outside looking in. They end their regular season with six of 10 games on the road and face six teams that would be in the postseason. Coach Stan Van Gundy didn’t sound optimistic after Wednesday’s dispiriting loss to the Bulls. \n“We’re just not playing. It was just bad all the way around,” he said. \nThe margins are so small that anything from an injury to an untimely suspension could sway the race. The season-as-a-marathon analogy no longer applies. It’s now a sprint to the finish. \nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Michael Singer on Twitter @msinger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T22:02:40.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
