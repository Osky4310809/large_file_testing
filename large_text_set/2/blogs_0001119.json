Mourinho’s at West Ham that day was a more sinister one. \nIf Mourinho is treated differently it is because he has serious form, Europe-wide. \nThat’s what happens, it’s called the law. Repeat offenders get bigger raps than first offenders. \nMourinho had a valid point about Klopp, but there is no doubt the German’s apologetic nature and his subsequent decent humour helps his cause. \nAre officials likely to be more forgiving to someone who seems genuinely contrite than to someone who has become overwhelmingly sarcastic, snarly and sardonic? \nThat’s what happens, it’s called human nature. \nWhere Mourinho doesn’t have a point is in his inference that there is some sort of refereeing conspiracy against him and his team ON the field.

Yes, United should have been awarded a penalty for this... ...like Rojo ought to have seen red and not yellow here (Photo: Sky Sports/Ruckas) \nThe truth is, everybody gets good and bad decisions in equal measure. \nThere was no conspiracy against Mourinho’s Chelsea of last season, as he claimed, and no conspiracy against his Man United of this season, as he seems to be claiming. \nThere is erroneous officiating, but only because the pace of Premier league play is so unrelenting and demanding for referees, while cheating players have become experts at conning them. \nIt is a cocktail certain to produce mistakes. Even Mourinho must, deep down, know this. \nBut his snappiness on Wednesday night was designed to do just one thing —camouflage another mediocre result in what has been a mediocre first Premier League season for him at Old Trafford. Mourinho's rants are a smokescreen to hide his underwhelming debut season at United (Photo: Reuters) \nIn the top flight, Mourinho has drawn or lost more matches than he has won. That is mediocre for a Man United manager. \nHe has just two points more than David Moyes had at this stage in his one and only season at United and one less than Louis van Gaal had after 23 games in the first of his two seasons. \nAnd that after being afforded the luxury of spending over £150million on players in the summer. \nHis rant about Klopp and Wenger is a smokescreen intended to hide the fact that for all the array of attacking talent at his disposal, Mourinho is embarrassingly reliant on a 35-year-old Zlatan Ibrahmovic for goals. After 30-something Zlatan, United's next highest scorer has just FOUR goals (Photo: Reuters) \nThe Swede has 14. \nNext on the list are Juan Mata and Paul Pogba, with four each. \nThat is the sort of issue Mourinho should be addressing, not whingeing about who gets what punishment. \nMourinho claims to be treated as ‘different’. \nHe needs to get back to doing what he did to make him different in the first place.
