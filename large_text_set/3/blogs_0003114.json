Derechos Humanos, principios y dignidad so‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Gs2wwm9XJ3\n‚Äî Braulio Guerra (@BraulioPRI) ID: 10631046 Part of the video shows that the section of wall Guerra climbed actually ends just a few feet west of where he is sitting, where the wall goes into the ocean. Someone wanting to enter the US there would likely find it easier to walk a few feet into the beach and walk around the wall rather than climb the 30-foot-tall barrier.\nPeople on Twitter were also quick to point out that although Guerra posted several pictures and video of him atop of the wall, there is no video of him actually climbing to the top, leading some to speculate on whether the politician had some help getting there.\nSome critics did not hold back.\n‚ÄúBraulio, fat slob‚Äù one person tweeted in response. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even climb the toilet by yourself.‚Äù\n@BraulioPRI Braulio, gordo inmundo.

Braulio Guerra\n‚Äî Sandra Guerra (@SanGuerra_) ID: 10631129 Guerra posted several videos of himself speaking from atop of the wall, but BuzzFeed News could not find any videos or pictures of the actual climb.\nIn one video posted on Facebook, Guerra shows two people atop of the wall who he said had been climbing it repeatedly while he was there.\n\nGuerra did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News‚Äô request for comment. He does note on his Facebook and Twitter profiles, however, that he completed four Ironman challenges.\n\n10.\nHere‚Äôs Why Trump‚Äôs \"Great Wall\" On The US‚ÄìMexico Border Is Basically A Pipe Dream \nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10631278 9.\nThe Federal Government Just Took The First Step In Building Trump‚Äôs Wall \nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10631255", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:45:24.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
