But Scream Queens star, Emma Roberts, has decided to keep her old self around in 2017 — at least when it comes to her old self’s fashion. Roberts is bringing her jaguar print trend into 2017 and we’re praising her because this trend is just too good to quit .\nYesterday, Roberts posted this Instagram of herself in her jaguar jacket . She captioned the photo, “Sipping and soaking in the first few days of 2017 in my @Coach Delancey watch.” And as much as Roberts loves her Coach watch, we know she loves her jaguar coat just as much .\nSipping and soaking in the first few days of 2017 in my @Coach Delancey watch #TimeforCoach #Partner \nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Jan 3, 2017 at 2:18pm PST \nWe know this because she’s pictured here celebrating Christmas Eve in the same jaguar print jacket (say that five times fast). Pairing it with a denim skirt made this look nod to the 90s. Roberts’ friend, Brit Elkin, is also wearing a 90s-inspired plaid outfit…\nMerry Christmas Eve everybody ❤️ @britelkin \nA photo posted by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Dec 24, 2016 at 12:13pm PST \n…but has been known to sport some jaguar print of her own.\nshopping / the holidays, captured by @chrismacho \nA video posted by Brit ELKIN (@britelkin) on Dec 22, 2016 at 10:10pm PST \nAnimal print — specifically leopard and jaguar — was a huge trend at the end of 2016. We were afraid we would have to put our faux furs away until they were fashionable five years from now. But, no. Thanks to fashionistas like Roberts and others, animal print is going strong in 2017 and will hopefully last throughout the rest of the winter.\n\nCheck out these badasses wearing their faux animal print proudly into the New Year.
