It must be rough hanging out in field with electric instruments and not one outlet in sightâ€¦ but who is Dominic? Well his full name is Dominic Angelella and he's a tough dude to pigeonhole. On the one hand the Philly based artist has contributed to projects by the likes of Hop Along, Cold Fronts, MewithoutYou, (plus he's currently the co-songwriter of the band Lithuania). On the other side he's been hired as a session dude by everyone from Kendrick Lamar, to Tinashe, to Juicy J, to Mac Miller, and Lil B. So what does that mean his solo stuff sounds like? Lifted from his forthcoming solo debut Goodnight, Doggies, \"Emotional Businessman\" is guileless, scuzzy, and DIY-shaped. The kind of songs that'd slide neatly into your collection between Sebadoh and Nada Surf. The video is similarly straightforward. One camera and a bunch of emoting in the snow. \n\"'Emotional Businessman' is about the endless battle between art and commerce,\" explains Dominic. \"I wrote this song when all that news about PharmaBro was coming to light. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount of people bankrolling various forms of art that were also involved in money-making schemes that directly/indirectly put profit before humanity. It can all feel very surreal, strange and distant to me, so I wanted the video to reflect that. Like watching Netflix on a computer with shitty speakers so you need the subtitles to understand what's going on. \nLet's just underscore that this is not a lyric video, because lyric videos are 100 percent the worst idea the music industry's come up with recently. Please stop. But watch this. \nGoodnight, Doggies is out February 3rd via Lame-O Records. \nDominic Tour Dates 2/1: BAR - New Haven, CT2/3: Johnny Brenda's - Philadelphia, PA2/4: Shea Stadium - Brooklyn, NY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T17:47:58.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
