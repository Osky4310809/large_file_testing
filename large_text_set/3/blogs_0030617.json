Ericksen reported Baylor \"said the plaintiff's allegations are barred by a two-year statute of limitations\" and that her allegations did not meet the standard of \"deliberate indifference.\" The lawsuit was filed anonymously by a plaintiff listed as \"Elizabeth Doe.\" According to the Dallas Morning News ' Sarah Mervosh , Doe—who said she was gang-raped in April 2013 by football players Tre'Von Armstead and Shamycheal Chatman—also alleged \"31 Baylor football players committed at least 52 acts of rape, including five gang rapes, between 2011 and 2014.\" Those figures far outnumbered the ones relayed by Baylor regents in October 2016. According to the Wall Street Journal 's Brad Reagan , regents said 17 women reported allegations of sexual or domestic assault, including four gang rapes, that involved 19 members of the football team. In her lawsuit, Doe alleged the football program embraced a \"show 'em a good time\" approach that \"used sex to sell\" the program to recruits, per Mervosh. The school refuted those allegations in its filing Tuesday. \"Baylor does not agree with or concede the accuracy of plaintiff's 146-paragraph complaint and its immaterial and inflammatory assertions,\" it stated, per Ericksen.
