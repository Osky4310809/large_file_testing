The materials currently used to create this ammo takes hundreds of years to degrade. The US Army says it is difficult to clean up after and so spent cartridges are simply left, creating the risk of ground and water contamination. \nInstead, the military wants to use biodegradable materials to replace current training rounds. The US agency says that inspiration could be found in the materials already used for biodegradable plastic bottles -- or completely different composites. \nAccording to the proposal, the US Army Corps of Engineers' Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) has already demonstrated ways that \"bioengineered\" seeds could be embedded into the biodegradable composites of such weaponry, where they would not begin germinating until several months later -- once bullet degradation begins. \n\"This effort will make use of seeds to grow environmentally friendly plants that remove soil contaminants and consume the biodegradable components developed under this project,\" the project states. \"Animals should be able to consume the plants without any ill effects.\" \nThis may not have any effect on today's active military grounds where conflict is ongoing, but if even training rounds can be made to have no detrimental impact on the environment, it is a start. \nProposals are being accepted until February 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T11:38:48.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
