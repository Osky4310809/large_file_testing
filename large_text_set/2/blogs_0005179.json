Or certainly as old as professional football. Player gets linked to transfer, gets pay rise with old club instead. Latest example: Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who may or may not have gotten fairly close to joining Chelsea last month. According to multiple sources in England and Scotland, the 34-year-old has been offered a “lucrative” new contract that would tie him to the Scottish champions for another season, until the summer of 2018. While the new contract would not match Chelsea’s supposed £50k per week offer, it would still provide a substantial increase over Gordon’s current £12k weekly wages . Celtic already had an option on Gordon’s contract for next season, but presumably the Chelsea interest in January has spurred them on to increase that offer slightly as well. You’re welcome, Craig Gordon! As far as Chelsea themselves, it’s widely accepted that Asmir Begović will be leaving in the summer so we will need a new backup goalkeeper. If Gordon’s set to stay, Chelsea will have to start looking elsewhere. In tangentially related Celtic-player-linked-with-Chelsea news, and to make a post about a backup goalkeeper a bit more exciting, here’s Moussa Dembélé scoring a goal from a wonderfully extravagant and needless rabona cross. You know, Moussa, Eden Hazard is really quite good at those things, too.
