That joke has been made hundreds, if not thousands of times. Including by Ted Cruz himself.\nWe can thank Deadspin for the latest development of the joke. They set a brilliant trap on Monday. Or seemingly so.\nSend us proof of Ted Cruz playing basketball https://t.co/MgGLnsscPf pic.twitter.com/mpxI5EBQkK \n— Deadspin (@Deadspin) January 23, 2017 Cruz responded with the best “Grayson Allen looks like Ted Cruz” joke yet.\n@Deadspin what do I win? pic.twitter.com/9XuRmmIkJS \n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2017 The best part of all of this might just be the fact Deaspin seemed legitimately interested in actually getting a picture of Ted Cruz playing basketball. Their post notes that Cruz has been playing a lot of basketball with fellow senators. While their tweet ended with a joke, it seems it was only a bonus to their original intentions. \nRegardless the joke has now become self aware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:56:38.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
