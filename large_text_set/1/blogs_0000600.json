Snow can make for some sick pictures. \nJust look at the White House, chilling under a beautiful coat of frost the morning after hosting the coolest party ever (see what I did there?). REUTERS \nAnd there are other great photos, taken by both professionals and amateurs, that highlight some of the best snaps of the day. \nSome of them come from northern cities, like New York, Boston and DC, places that are no strangers to huge blizzards. One Massachusetts resident pretty much perfectly summed up how used to this weather Northeastern residents are. \nDiane Carr of Edgartown told the Boston Globe , \nIt’s actually beautiful light snow. But there’s a lot of it. We probably have about eight inches so far, on top of four we have yesterday… It’s very pretty, actually. \nOther photos are from Southern cities like Raleigh and Atlanta, which, let’s just say, is a little bit less accustomed to this type of weather. Atlanta is about to receive 4 inches of snow.
