Many politicians of both parties favour a “comprehensive reform” that would secure the border, allow a realistic number of newcomers in and offer a path to citizenship for illegal migrants already inside the country. However, restrictionists have killed every reform bill since 1986. Meanwhile, facts on the ground have evolved rapidly. Population flows from Mexico to America surged from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s. The number of unauthorised immigrants in America rose from 3.5m in 1990 to a high of 12.2m in 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis. Since then, this figure has fallen slightly: net migration from Mexico to the United States is now negative. Barack Obama had a mixed record. He had more people deported than any previous president, prompting critics to label him the “deporter-in-chief”. However, the large headline numbers obscure an important distinction. Although deportations of would-be immmigrants apprehended while trying to cross the border rose sharply while he was in office, those of people who had already made it past the border region fell. In 2014 Mr Obama ordered federal agencies to prioritise the deportation only of unauthorised immigrants convicted of criminal offences or suspected of terrorism. This tacitly shielded some three-quarters of them from forced removal. Donald Trump seeks to change this policy. On February 21st, the president signed an executive order stipulating that the government should target most illegal immigrants for deportation, not just criminals. That will expand the pool of potential deportees from around 2m to 8m-11m. Mr Trump is also keen to speed up the deportation process. At present, only unauthorised immigrants caught within 100 miles (161 km) of the border who have been in the country for less than 14 days can be deported without a hearing. The administration may change the rules so that any illegal immigrant who has been in America for less than two years can be deported without going before a judge. America’s unauthorised immigrants have always lived in legal limbo. If Mr Trump’s directives are implemented, they will also live in fear.
