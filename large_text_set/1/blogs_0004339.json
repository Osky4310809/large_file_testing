The Bees are holding out for a £15million offer for Hogan (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nBilic said: “He’s a good player. I watched him a few times. \n“He is very sharp, quick – a good finisher, doing it in Championship. He’s young and a good prospect.” \nBilic has reiterated his admiration for Defoe after seeing a £6million bid for the 34-year-old marksman rejected this week.

Billie added: “He has the things that are the most important in a football games - that’s goals. \n“He scored them last season, maybe or probably the main reason they stayed up, and then he continues to do the same this season, scoring again. A couple in the last game. \n“In every game he is having chances and most of the chances he is converting them into goals. He is an excellent player of course.” poll loading Should West Ham sign Scott Hogan from Brentford? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:23:11.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
