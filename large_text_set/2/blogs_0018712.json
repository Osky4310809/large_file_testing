When that something is old air-cooled Volkswagens, multiply all that by whatever the number equivalent of a creepy moan is. Today I have two larval Type 2 Microbus styling concepts to share with you, because, let’s be honest: I’m crazy about you.\nAdvertisement \n\nThis first concept I first saw on the fantastic Car Design Archives Facebook group, but the source for that was this German VW Microbus site . What it seems we’re looking at here is a 1960 design study known as EA114. \nThis study would have been part of one of the first real attempts to update the original Microbus design, which dates from 1950. This one seems to pre-date the development of what would become the second generation of VW Transporter (what VW tended to call the Type 2 internally).\n\nThere’s a lot that’s interesting about this concept. It’s described as the “Heckmotor mit Lufteinlässen an der Front” which means, roughly, ‘rear engine with air intakes in the front,’ and, yep, you can clearly see a bunch of air intakes on the lower edge of the front facia of the bus.\nAdvertisement \n\nIt’s interesting – getting air to an air-cooled engine at the rear is tricky, especially for a big box like the Type 2. In a Beetle, air is captured as it flows over the roof, but that doesn’t really happen on a bus. The first generation just used vents at the lower rear sides, and the T2 second-gen bus had sort of ear-like ‘scoops’ at the D-pillars. Pulling air right from the front and channeling it to the rear seems like a pretty good idea.\nAlso interesting here is the hood-like flap on the front used to house the spare tire in a sort of narrow, vertical trunk. It was pretty common for Microbus owners to mount the spare on the front, to free up room in the cargo area at rear and add a bit of very welcome crash protection, too. \n\nIt makes sense that VW would have at least tried some more formal way of integrating the tire, and I think this is a great way to do it. I love the idea of some kind of little frunk on the nose of the Bus for a tire and maybe some tools or the jack and some jumper cables and stuff; it could really help de-clutter the cargo area, and, yes, let the other car at least hit that tire before your knees. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:22:59.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
