Charles Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, goes on to declare that the fresh-faced law school graduate is deeply concerned. She believes the Senate should explore Gorsuch’s values “further during his confirmation hearings for the United States Supreme Court.” \nThe charges set forth by Sisk are somewhat reminiscent of Anita Hill’s charges against Clarence Thomas. \nIn 1991, Hill — and then a bevy of acolytes — alleged that Thomas shouldn’t be a Supreme Court Justice because, she claimed, he asked her on a date and told bawdy jokes — fully a decade before his Supreme Court nomination. \nThomas flatly denied the allegations. Hill’s long-delayed claims generated much outrage on the left but ultimately failed to derail the Senate’s confirmation of Thomas.

The April 20, 2016 Facebook posting by Sisk uses the words “patriarchy” and “rich white men.” \nSisk has been a staffer for former Sen. Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat. She also worked in some capacity for the Department of the Interior during President Barack Obama’s administration. \nThe University of Colorado is most famous, of course, for launching an on-campus spying campaign encouraging students to report incidents of “bias” to government officials at the school. The point of the “Bias Incident Reporting” scheme is to make the taxpayer-funded Boulder campus free of “demeaning and hurtful statements.” School officials have advertised the campaign with posters featuring absurdly demeaning and hurtful statements. “Go back to Africa, you don’t belong here,” one school-funded poster has read. “Your mom must be the janitor ’cause that’s the only job for dirty Mexicans, a second poster has declared.
