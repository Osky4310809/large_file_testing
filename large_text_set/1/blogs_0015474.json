In a strange case of “life imitating art,” the president-elect recently spoke with The Washington Post about what his new slogan would be for his second term. The only problem is that it’s already been used by “ The Purge : Election Year.” In the interview, Trump explained how he crafted “Make America Great Again” and announced his 2020 reelection slogan: “Keep America Great.” “Are you ready?” Trump said. “ ‘Keep America Great,’ exclamation point.

I’d like the audience to play with it and see who they feel is representative of the actual candidates in the real world, without me saying who’s who.
