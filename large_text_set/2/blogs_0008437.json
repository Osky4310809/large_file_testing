Feb 4, 2017 7:46 PM \nCongratulations Khalil! osiris33 (bandwagon since 1976) says: Feb 4, 2017 7:51 PM \nUm, no… Feb 4, 2017 7:52 PM \nThe conspiracy continues – this award belonged to Shazier. radrntn says: Feb 4, 2017 7:56 PM \nGotta love the haters…..Much deserved Mack….keep it up, and this next season you will have an actual DE on the opposite side of you because everybody knows Irvin is a OLB…Actually I am looking forward to you and Irvin lining on the same side to really wreck havoc, opposite Mario Edwards JR , and Aldon Smith. \nGo Raiders!!! Go Reggie!!! militantgod says: Feb 4, 2017 8:00 PM \nGreat player, but I think he got a little help from his name recognition and how well the Raiders did this year. \nThere were better performances this year, even at the LB position. Mack is a DE. He lead the league in QB pressures, plays 90% of the plays, had 11 sacks, 5 FF, and closed out games with a strip, sack, fumble recovery on multiple occasions. He’s a finisher! He was consistently dominating, not having only a few splash games to inflate his numbers (8 games in a row with a sack and he’s the best run defender in football). No LB in football came close to that. No DE came close to that. Add in how Mack had NOBODY on the interior line helping him. The only player in Mack’s league this year was Aaron Donald. Now, that kid is a beast. Give Nack a couple of good player and now with Pagano coming in to run the D, the sky is even higher. Feb 4, 2017 8:01 PM \nProbably should have won it last year as well. Feb 4, 2017 8:02 PM \nHaters gonna hate. Much congrats to Mr. Mack!!! Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
