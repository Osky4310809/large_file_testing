These Gems play a huge part in doing everything from upgrading troops to purchasing some of the more costly village items in the game. Check out the following tips below to figure out the best ways towards lining your pockets with more Gems (we even have a few ways you can get them for free!): \n• 1st-time players of Clash of Clans will automatically be granted 500 free gems. Only problem is they’re given to you because you have to use 250 of them during the tutorial stages of the game. Don’t worry about rushing the building and troop production that the game gives you the choice of doing. Keep those Gems in hand. \n• You can earn a small amount of free gems just by clearing out the debris (like trees and rocks, for instance). \n• You should also pay close attention to the in-game achivements. By completing each and every one of them, you’ll come away with more free gems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:01:48.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
