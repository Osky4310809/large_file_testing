A vote was called to censure Warren, which passed 49-43. \n“She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the discipline, \nWhile many would likely claim McConnell was justified for enforcing rules of decency and proper decorum on the Senate floor, Clinton sees it differently.   \n“I wrote this book for everyone who’s ever wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down — for everyone who’s ever been made to feel less than,” said Clinton. \n“The 13 women in She Persisted all overcame adversity to help shape our country — sometimes through speaking out, sometimes by staying seated, sometimes by captivating an audience,” Clinton continued. \n“With this book, I want to send a message to young readers around the country, and the world, that persistence is power,” Clinton added. \nAlthough Warren is seen as one of the most radical leftists elected to the Senate, many Democrats hope she will come to lead the party in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s crushing defeat in last year’s presidential election.
