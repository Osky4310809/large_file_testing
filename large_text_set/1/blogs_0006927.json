The monarch said this on Friday while speaking with journalists on the court premises after the presiding magistrate, Mr. Olusola Aluko, transferred the case for reassignment. Oluwo Oke said, “I have to withdraw the case because of people like Baba Olusegun Obasanjo, the governor and other eminent personalities, who begged me to withdraw it. “I have to do that in the interest of peace in the state. Although I am an Oba, there are people, who one should also respect.” Oba Adeoye’s counsel, Mr. Soji Oyetayo, had earlier told the court that his client had filed a notice of withdrawal due to pleas from prominent personalities and he obliged them in the interest of peace.
