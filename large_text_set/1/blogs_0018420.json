Sony confirmed the rollout in a tweet yesterday alongside a trailer for the new software.\nThe update to the Z4 Tablet highlights how Sony has improved the way it delivers software updates since the last generation; Z4 Tablet owners waited until March 2016 to receive the previous major upgrade, Android Marshmallow, five months after it became available. Nougat, conversely, has only been around for three months.\nCheck out the trailer for the new software below for a look at what’s in store when you get the update.\nThough there are rumors that the rollout to the Xperia Z5 has been halted , here’s hoping that the Xperia Z4 Tablet deployment runs smooth.\nLet us know in the comments what you think of Sony’s take on Android Nougat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T18:51:41.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
