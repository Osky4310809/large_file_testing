If the Wild win two rounds, the pick becomes a second-round choice. \nIt has been reported that the trade is all but finalized and that teams are simply waiting on a trade call to make the deal official. \nIf the trade becomes official, the WIld would gain the third-line center they have been searching for all season. \nHanzal, 30, has 16 goals this season which leads the Coyotes and ties a career-high. \nWhite, 28, a centerman and right winger, has scored seven goals and 13 points in 46 games this season. No trade call yet, but MIN and ARI are working to finalize a trade involving Martin Hanzal. — Bob McKenzie (@TSNBobMcKenzie) February 26, 2017 TRADE: Martin Hanzal ➡️ Minnesota Wild pic.twitter.com/gG0GtyP1ec — NHL on NBC (@NHLonNBCSports) February 27, 2017 Contact ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:03:47.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
