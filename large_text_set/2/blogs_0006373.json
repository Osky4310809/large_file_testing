While it is evident that he is enjoying fatherhood, we haven't really heard about how life has changed for him since the birth of his daughter. In a recent interview with GQ , he said, \"fatherhood is like taking a bath. It is cleansing.

I was impatient to get married and have a family.\" \nAnd, Shahid and Mira are not stopping at one! He also shared, \"Mira, who is just 22, would prefer to have a second kid as well.
