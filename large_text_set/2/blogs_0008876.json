Parents Speak Out After Stranger Pays for Son’s Haircut: “It Felt Like for a Moment, We Weren’t Alone” Karen Johnson When Jaime Nystuen and her husband Adam took their 4-year-old son Noah to get his haircut recently, they braced themselves for the worst. Haircuts were always a battle that drew stares and judgment from others who didn’t know about Noah’s autism. This time, however, was different. A kind stranger showed them true compassion. image source: Jaime Nystuen Jaime tells Babble that Noah was diagnosed with autism two years ago, but she knew something was wrong from the time he was 7 months old. He didn’t reach for her and didn’t seem to crave human connection. And although not many people have been outright rude in response to Noah’s behavior, no one has ever gone out of their way to be kind. That is, until a stranger sitting next to Noah at the hair salon did just that. Jaime recounted the outing in a Facebook post, which KTVU News Anchor Frank Somerville shared . Noah was in the midst of an epic meltdown that included screaming, crying, and nearly vomiting. The man in the chair next to him didn’t stare or judge. Instead, he shared that he’d been through something similar recently when trying to get his twins haircuts. It wasn’t until Jaime and Adam tried to pay the bill, however, that they knew just how kind this stranger was. Low and behold, the nice man had already paid for Noah’s haircut (including tip!), and left before they could thank him. Jaime and Adam were speechless. “It was so much more than a free haircut. It felt like for a moment, we weren’t alone in this journey.” — Jaime Nystuen Share Quote Facebook Pinterest Jaime told Babble that one of the hardest parts about Noah’s autism is their commitment to taking him out of the house, out of his comfort zone, and letting him experience new things. “Some people have said we should just cut his hair at home or let it grow out. The thing is, these experiences, in my opinion are helping his growth. The first time he went to school, the dentist, all of it, there were meltdowns,” she said. “And there are still meltdowns and there will probably always be but sometimes they are better and that’s when I have hope. Hope that he is growing tolerant of sensory triggers. The world isn’t going to stop just because Noah has a meltdown and I won’t shelter him from the wonderful experiences the world brings us.” And it was this sympathetic man’s gesture that solidified her decision to keep trying. The world will likely not be easy for Noah, but there is kindness out there and he deserves to experience it. According to Autism Speaks , “ increasing acceptance, respect, and support ” of kids with autism can improve their quality of life. And with 1 in 68 children diagnosed as being on the spectrum, according to the CDC, hopefully acts of compassion such as this will become more and more common. Jaime and Adam wish they could personally thank the man from the salon. Jaime told Babble, “It was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for us. And it was such a gift. It was so much more than a free haircut. It felt like for a moment, we weren’t alone in this journey. Someone was rooting for us and I’ll never forget it.” Related Post Article Posted 2 days Ago Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T12:10:40.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
