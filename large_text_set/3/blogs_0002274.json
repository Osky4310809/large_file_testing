Baby Scout may be all right but Sam is not. Giving birth under a bridge is not ideal. \nSam lies there unconscious and Jason panics. Sam begged Jason to promise her once he had Scout safe in his arms that he would get their daughter to safety and not stay behind with her. General Hospital spoilers say Jason breaks that promise and won’t leave his wife’s side. Sam: Once I have this baby take it and go. Please. Somethings wrong. I can feel it. JASON, PROMISE ME, PLEASE. Promise on our lives. #GH pic.twitter.com/opqw43ZWud \n—✧✦✧✦✧✦ (@fyeahGH) February 28, 2017 Where’s The Ambulance? \nJason had Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson) searching nearby cameras and called for medical help but so far, no EMTs have shown up. Everyone seems to walk everywhere in Port Charles, so how come it takes forever to get an ambulance from General Hospital to JaSam and their baby? \nGeneral Hospital spoilers predict Sam will have a mini crisis at General Hospital and it may be a few days of touch and go “will she die?” action but then the Phoenix will rise again. General Hospital viewers eagerly await the introduction of Scout’s brothers, Danny and Jake, to the little girl. Confessions Of A Non-Cheater \nNelle Hayes (Chloe Lanier) isn’t willing to let go her shot at a millionaire boyfriend so easily and General Hospital spoilers promise instead of hightailing it out of Port Charles, she’ll offer a mea culpa to Michael for wrecking his family. What are the odds that Michael accepts her anyway? \nLet’s see. Michael forgave Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for shooting his bio father AJ Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) so General Hospital spoilers tease Michael will stick by his girl. Plus, it’s not like she really slept with his dad, right? It’s all good unless Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) kills her first. Carly: How could you do this to our marriage, Sonny? #CarSon #GH pic.twitter.com/PE82rkhIX3 \n—✧✦✧✦✧✦ (@fyeahGH) February 28, 2017 Sonny On The Hot Seat \nSonny can’t defend himself from Carly’s accusations on the Wednesday, March 1 General Hospital because even he thinks he’s guilty. It was pretty shady that Sonny showed up at Nelle’s door when he’s never been there before and Carly caught him at it. That was convenient for the plot. \nCarly is shocked he cheated on her but has she met Sonny? This is the guy that had sex with his son’s girlfriend in a crypt at the funeral of a man Sonny murdered. General Hospital spoilers predict it won’t be too long before Nelle confesses to the Corinthos crowd that no nookie occurred. Liv Is Livid \nLiv Jerome (Tonja Walker) basked in vengeful glory for about a minute until she was deflated by learning she lost General Hospital to a higher bidder. Liv will be dealt a second blow when Ava Jerome (Maura West) is released by the PCPD say upcoming General Hospital spoilers. \nLiv tells Julian Jerome (William deVry) she has no further use for him and pulls a knife ready to filet her little brother but somehow, General Hospital spoilers promise, he’ll grovel and talk his way out of what seems like certain death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:06:33.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
