Especially when you start following an account dedicated to fluffy little kittens. \nSEE ALSO: Who are the 41 lucky people Trump follows on Twitter? \nThat's right. Donald Trump — soon to become the 45th president of the United States — followed 'Emergency Kittens' on Twitter for a few hours. As you might have guessed, ' Emergency Kittens ' is an account dedicated to photos and videos of tiny felines. \npic.twitter.com/6NMuo98I2A \n— Emergency Kittens (@EmrgencyKittens) December 20, 2016 \nTheir mission — as outlined in their Twitter bio — is simple: \"Critiquing the cutest cats online!\" What's not to love?\nOn Sunday night, Trump followed the account, which lays claim to almost 2 million followers. Was it an accident? Or did Trump just admit to the world that he secretly really, really, really loves kitties? \nuhmmm hi so donald trump just followed an emergency kittens twitter account pic.twitter.com/DvskDPnlgD \n— joe malunda (@maloonds) January 2, 2017 \nTrump doesn't follow very many people on Twitter. Indeed, until recently he was following a mere 41 people . The list — not including the kitten account — comprises politicians connected to the Trump campaign, members of his family, a select few journalists, and accounts belonging to his businesses. \nNaturally, the addition to the list of accounts Trump's following caused a stir on Twitter. \nI don't know why trump following emergency kittens is the funniest thing ever but it is. Except for the fact that he doesn't deserve cats\n— Kat (@wtfniaII) January 2, 2017 \nLmao Donald Trump follows emergency kittens. I guess we all gotta see some cute cat pics to stay happy lol\n— Swirfty (@Swirfty) January 2, 2017 \nAhahahahahaha Trump actually follows the emergency kittens account, this is incredible\n— #1 Todd B Fan (@fjordzz) January 2, 2017 \nThe person behind the account decided to reach out to their new follower with a private message containing the opening line of a joke. Trump, however, didn't wait around for the punchline and unfollowed 'Emergency Kittens'. \nIt's a Meowntain. But he unfollowed before the punchline. pic.twitter.com/emcQanPx4Y \n— Emergency Kittens (@EmrgencyKittens) January 2, 2017 \nWe'll likely never know if this out-of-character Twitter follow was accidental, or a hint that Trump is secretly nurturing a love for tiny kittens. Let's hope it's the latter. \nBONUS: Christmas Kittens Frolickicking by the Yule Log", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T12:33:24.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
