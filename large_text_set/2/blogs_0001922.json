According to Pruetz, even if hunters bag one female chimp every couple years, it would change the gender balance of the community.\nBONUS: Tracking sea turtles", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/z15mB8EK.jpg", "http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10764-016-9942-9", "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-01/isu-cbf013117.php", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/z15mB8EK.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-01T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:55:07.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
