His poster had peace signs, a star, a heart, an American symbol, a duck, a little man dancing with a squid and a kitty that got flipped upside down. He also had written the word “peace” across the top. \n“He was a guy that showed peace,” Matthew said, explaining what he has learned about King. “He’s very nice. He’s a caring person.” \nEllie Seawell, 5, was on her second MLK march this year. On Monday, she walked in the Marade down East Colfax Avenue with her family. Ellie was following in the footsteps of her 79-year-old grandfather Buie Seawell, a former state Democratic party chief who marched with King in the 1965 memorial march for James Reeb in Selma, Ala. \n“He changed the world a lot,” she said about King. \nBuie Seawell, who joined his granddaughter Tuesday, was a Presbyterian minister who ran into King at the airport in Alabama before the memorial. He approached King, shook his hand and told him that people from his church were going to the march. The civil rights leader invited the head of Seawell’s church to sit next to him at the service. Joe Amon, The Denver Post Kindergarten students march together to Montview Boulevard Presbyterian Church, Jan. 17, 2017 Denver. \n“It was just a moment of touching history,” Seawell said. “It remains one of the dearest memories I have.” \nAfter singing, the kindergartners moved inside where they heard from a speaker and listened to Denver County judge Dianne Briscoe sing “Up to the Mountaintop,” a song based on King’s last speech. \nBriscoe’s mother, Ruth Denny, was a major figure in Colorado’s civil rights movement as a member of the Congress for Racial Equality. Briscoe recalled times when she and her brother helped make picketing signs in their living room, joining their mother on the line protesting discriminatory practices at Denver businesses. \nThe Tuesday march meant a lot to Briscoe, who said she was glad the elementary schools were teaching their students about King so his history of fighting for civil rights “doesn’t just go away and become forgotten.” \nWhile speaking to the kids, Briscoe held the Denver Post Sunday from Jan. 18, 1998, with a page 1 story that quoted her mother. Denny said then that she worried that the civil rights pendulum was swinging backward after a wave of national conservatism cut affirmative action programs and harmed immigrants. \nShe and fellow CORE leader James Reynolds were concerned that black youth were either stuck in violent urban inner-cities or lulled into complacency by good jobs, dissociating from the movement headed by King, Rosa Parks and Malcolm X. \nWhen asked about whether her mother’s words still rang true today, Briscoe thought for a second and then said, “I would agree with her that it’s still a struggle.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:35:48.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
