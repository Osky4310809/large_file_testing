It would soon become Mazda's top seller in Europe. \nIn fact, one-quarter of all Mazdas sold globally are CX-5s, and it's still Europe's favourite today despite being the oldest model generation in the carmaker's line-up. With the all-new CX-5, Mazda aimed to improve on the strengths of a vehicle that has captured well over 100 awards to date, redefining the standard for compact SUVs while evolving the car's Jinba-Ittai personality in harmony with human sensibilities. \nThe intuitive nature of the all-new CX-5 shines inside the \"heads-up\" cabin, where all important functions are designed for operation with the least possible effort. For example, the vehicle is now available with a windscreen projected head-up display, a feature otherwise seen in this class only in premium models, and a centre console display located on top of the dash for easier viewing. Efforts to reduce road, wind and powertrain noise, meanwhile, enable stress-free conversation. The refined design and outstanding craftsmanship round out the relaxed, upscale interior atmosphere. \nAN EXPERIENCE IN QUALITY \nAs for the exterior, the all-new CX-5 gave the previous generation's KODO shapes a minimalist aesthetic, removing non-essential elements. The \"refined toughness\" motto for the new model emphasises a solid, imposing SUV stance with a wider track, A-pillars positioned rearwards, and a lower roof and beltline. The theme echoes inside the roomy cabin with sleek yet rugged elements flowing horizontally outwards from the steering wheel. 2017 Mazda CX-5 [EU] \nPropulsion comes from the same distinguished line-up of lightweight SKYACTIV powertrains and chassis so praised in the outgoing generation, only now tweaked for added responsiveness and efficiency. Together with handling and safety-enhancing innovations like G-Vectoring Control, they react precisely as the driver intends, immediately building confidence and satisfaction, while sharing Jinba-Ittai - the car as an extension of the driver - with everyone on board. \nWith enriched premium-level quality, intuitive functionality and outstanding responsiveness, the all-new Mazda CX-5 is a class above the rest of Europe's compact SUV segment. \nEXTERIOR Shorter (5 mm) and lower (35 mm) with a 5mm wider rear track contributing to the surefooted stance \"Refined toughness\": A look of powerful, dignified elegance signature wing stretching from below the sleek LED headlamps and sporty three-dimensional grille emphasise the all-new CX-5's width strong stance and sense of lateral flow accentuated by the A-pillars (positioned 35mm to the rear), lower roof and beltline, slim LED fog lights and rear combination lamps side character line accents kept to a minimum, highlighting the transitions between surfaces in an expression of motion stretching the length of the vehicle Smaller door mirrors improve visibility and aerodynamics, now featuring an auto-retracting function Aluminium wheels offered in gun metallic (19-inch) and dark silver (17-inch); 17- inch steel wheels also available Features Soul Red Crystal, a new premium body finish with an especially vivid and deep red with ruby-like transparency achieves a richness of colour using a highly saturated pigment for the translucent coat while adding depth with special light-absorbing flakes and brightness with uniformly sized aluminium flakes in the reflective coat thus evolves Mazda's Takuminuri painting technology and the unique threecoat structure used for other premium colours like Soul Red and Machine Grey also available in eight other body colours: Machine Grey, Sonic Silver, Titanium Flash, Eternal Blue, Deep Crystal Blue, Jet Black, Snowflake White Pearl, and Arctic White \nINTERIOR The refined toughness theme continues in the cabin with a harmony between tension and relaxation combining SUV sturdiness and flawless finishing quality Human-centric design heightens the Jinba-Ittai experience for all occupants, from the feel of the various textures to the solidly crafted and finely tuned doors Snug cockpit with a tastefully sleek arrangement: elements like the climate control louvres and decorative panel flow horizontally outwards from the steering wheel to the door trim \"metal wood\" deco trim combines strength and warmth Airy cabin features a higher centre console and clean-cut appearance, while the larger sunroof enhances the roomy feel Seats designed to relieve fatigue, even on long trips front seats built for more comfort and less vibration with thicker cushions, additional side and shoulder support, and high-end urethane foam in the seatbacks 10-way power driver's seat with memory functionality that includes the corresponding head-up display settings

front cupholders, and larger door and seatback pocket capacity Optional front wiper de-icer - a Mazda first - and standard headlamp washers \nCHASSIS & BODY SKYACTIV-VEHICLE DYNAMICS vehicle motion control technology arrives on the allnew CX-5 with G-Vectoring Control (GVC), which subtly adjusts engine torque to smoothen out g-forces, optimising the load on each wheel and improving tire grip enhances vehicle responsiveness and stability - particularly for SUVs, whose higher centre of gravity increases vulnerability to lateral forces - while improving passenger comfort by stifling lateral motion Available with economical FWD or i-ACTIV AWD, which uses 27 individual sensors to monitor driver intentions and changing road conditions, continuously optimizing torque distribution to the wheels automatic on-demand system with no manual switching required for optimum Jinba-Ittai driving tandem ball bearing system dramatically reduces slippage and resistance uses special synthetic oil to maintain low viscosity even at extremely cold temperatures, thus reducing energy losses SKYACTIV-Chassis modified for better responsiveness and more refined vehicle behaviour uses rigid steering couplings to improve the response to steering input, with revised structure to supress vibration improved suspension and steering characteristics of the front MacPherson strut and rear multi-link set-up for a more linear response, composed cornering and a noticeably smoother ride overall four-wheel anti-lock braking (4W-ABS) upgraded to match evolved suspension with enhanced braking control and shorter stopping distances new auto-hold function keeps the vehicle at a standstill even after releasing the brake SKYACTIV-Body resolves better than ever the conflicting attributes of safety, weight and stiffness (and thus handling) with more lightweight high-strength steel and thicker and/or stiffer materials at strategic locations like the A-pillars bases, cowl member, suspension housings, lower dash section and brackets torsional stiffness increased by more than 15% over the current CX-5, improving the body's response to steering operations NVH reduced for a quieter cabin enabling stress-free conversation, suppressing road, wind and tire noise by: optimising shapes (e.g. of suspension parts) to restrain vibration and resonance adding sealant and diminishing body gap sizes improving aerodynamic forms, e.g. A-pillars, air flow-friendly wiper layout, active air shutter in the lower grille in front of the radiator lowering the drag coefficient by 6% relative to the outgoing model \nPOWERTRAINS \nSKYACTIV-G petrol engines feature accelerator behaviour attuned to the given situation: for a smooth, comfortable start when slowly pulling away from a standstill for reliably sudden acceleration when merging on to a motorway Mazda thereby links vehicle response to driver intentions, for predictable vehicles and confident drivers Naturally aspirated high compression direct-injection engines available in two displacements, both Euro 6 compliant \nSKYACTIV-G 2.0 World-high 14:1 compression ratio, special piston cavities to suppresses cooling losses, a

outstanding torque and fuel economy with acceleration matched to human sensibilities for performance that simply feels right. They're also remarkably quiet, with a pleasingly comfortable ambience for everyone in the cabin. 14:1 compression ratio, the lowest available, and a variable twin turbocharger Available in two power versions, both Euro 6 compliant without expensive exhaust aftertreatment High-Precision DE Boost Control for a more direct reaction to accelerator input by enhancing control of turbo pressure and fuel injection adjustments Natural Sound Smoother, which reduces diesel knocking in the 3.5kHz range most perceptible in the cabin using a damper in each piston pin to \"cancel\" the vibration caused by vertical motion Natural Sound Frequency Control, which suppresses knocking in other critical frequency ranges of diesel vibration (1.3kHz, 1.7kHz & 2.5kHz) by deviating engine timing to neutralise pressure waves Available in two output variants: 110kW/150PS at 4,500rpm & 380Nm of torque at 1,800-2,600rpm 129kW/175PS at 4,500rpm & 420Nm at 2,000rpm \nSKYACTIV-Drive six-speed automatic transmission, now more predictable than ever: Intuitive shift timing thanks to a new shift control scheme that anticipates driver intentions based on vehicle speed, throttle position, engine speed and other factors Achieves greater cornering stability and reduces unnecessary shifts when accelerating out of corners for even smoother vehicle behavior In a first for Mazda, diesel models now come with a low-rigidity lock-up damper, which supports their high torque while also enabling a quieter ride and wider lock-up range, enhancing fuel economy \nSKYACTIV-MT six-speed manual, with a stiffer structure and effortless control: Redesigned housing at the base of the shifter maintains rigidity despite the higher mounting position of the shifter Retains the short short MX-5-inspired stroke, with a modified shift lever position easing operation by smaller drivers Diesel models get a new peak torque limiter to control clutch pedal speed, improving the response to quick pedal action and reducing the shock from a missed shift \nSAFETY \nFeatures the full range of i-ACTIVSENSE active and pre-crash safety technology Mazda Radar Cruise Control (MRCC) with stop-and-go function, a Mazda first extending the minimum operating speed to 0 km/h. MRCC automatically maintains a safe distance to the preceding vehicle Advanced Smart City Brake Support (Advanced SCBS) uses the CX-5's new forward sensing camera to detect vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles, automatically braking if necessary. The system works at 4-80km/h and now has pedestrian recognition from 10km/h upwards (CX-5 debut). It includes Smart City Brake Support [Reverse] (SCBS R), which spots obstacles behind the car when reversing at 2-8km/h Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) also uses the camera to \"read\" speed limit and no entry signs, indicating them in the headup display (CX-5 debut) Adaptive LED Headlights (ALH) improves night-time visibility at 40km/h+ with automated glare-free high beams, wide-range low beams that provide a wider field of vision at e.g. intersections, and \"highway mode\", which automatically shifts the aim of the headlamps upward at higher speeds. The LED array is now split into 12 rather than four independently controlled blocks, each of which can shut off to avoid impairing the vision of oncoming motorists while still maintaining superb visibility The all-new CX-5 carries over existing systems from the outgoing model including Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) with Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA), Smart Brake Support (SBS), Lane-keep Assist System (LAS), Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS), Driver Attention Alert (DAA), Emergency Stop Signal (ESS), Hill Launch Assist (HLA), and of course fourway ABS with EBD ( electronic brakeforce distribution), EBA (brake assist), DSC (dynamic stability control) and TCS (traction control system) \nPASSIVE SAFETY The high-strength SKYACTIV-Body is enhanced further to hinder cabin deformation during a collision with better vertical control of crash energy stronger yet lighter materials added around the cabin including 1180MPa ultra-high strength steel for the A-pillars and 980MPa steel in the B-pillars and side sills Improved pedestrian protection with a new structure for the bracket securing the upper portion of front grille to better protect children's heads and the legs of adults", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:08:29.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
