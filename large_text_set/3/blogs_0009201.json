(Image: Reuters) \nAvenue Supermart’s Rs 1,870 crore IPO got oversubscribed before the close of bidding on the first day of opening for subscription, on the back of robust participation from institutional investors and retail buyers, stock exchanges data showed. \nAs of about 3.40 pm, the overall issue was subscribed 1.16 times. The portion reserved for QIBs (qualified institutional bidders) was subscribed 1.61 times, and retail investors bid for 1.2 times of the portion reserved for them, the data showed. However, non-institutional high-networth individuals’ participation in the issue was lacklustre so far, with the category getting subscribed only 42% of the reserved size. \nAhead of the public issue, the company yesterday raised Rs 561 crore by issuing 1.87 crore shares at the top end of the price band to 35 anchor investors, including General Atlantic Singapore, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, HSBC, Motilal Oswal and UTI, among others. \nSeveral analysts have recommended subscribing to issue given the company’s strong financial and operational profile, and its promising growth record over the years. TV news channels report that the street is abuzz with high interest into the issue from institutional investors, with the QIB portion of the issue expected to receive 75-100 times subscription. \nD-Mart, India’s most profitable supermarket chain, is looking to raise the money to retire part of its debt, redemption of non-convertible debentures, purchase of fit-outs for new stores and general corporate purposes. \nYou may also like to watch: \nThe company is promoted by Radhakishan Damani, the veteran stock market trader and investor who had been in the Forbes list of wealthiest people. Damani and his family own 91.34% equity stake in Avenue Supermarts (pre-issue). \nD-Mart has a strong presence in Maharashtra and Gujarat, and also operates stores in Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, NCR, Daman and Rajasthan. \nMost analysts have praised the company’s business model, and hence the growth it offers to the investors. The company maintains low-cost operations, owns the stores rather than renting them and thus saving on rental costs, keeps improving product assortment based on its own data analytics, and seems to saturate the territory and then achieve profitability. Analysts say it follows the same business approach as Wal Mart of the US. \nThe public issue, which is open for subscription at Rs 295-299 per share, closes on Friday, March 10. 50% of the shares are reserved for qualified institutional buyers (QIB), 15% for high net-worth individuals (HNIs) and 35% for retail investors.
