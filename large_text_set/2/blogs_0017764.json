Only Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo, not Peter Mayhew this time) is in costume, and Woody Harrelson (who plays Han Solo's mentor) is in a baggy blue sweatshirt that almost looks like a bathrobe. \nThe rest of the photo includes Alden Ehrenreich as young Han (leather jacket over denim shirt), Emilia Clarke of \" Game of Thrones \" fame, Donald Glover as young Lando Calrissian, and British actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are also pictured. \nThe StarWars.com article notes that filming began Monday at London's Pinewood Studios. \nImmediate fan reaction was mixed. @starwars no offense but no one asked for this", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:41:09.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
