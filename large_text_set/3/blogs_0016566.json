He has succeeded by bullsh***ing. He has gotten the presidency by bullsh***ing. It’s very hard to tell somebody at that point that bullsh** doesn’t work because look at results.” \nTake a look, but brace yourself for offensive language : \nHad someone attempted to say such a thing about former Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton or former President Barack Obama, the feed would have been cut and outrage would have descended upon the guest for even thinking about using such language.   \nZakaria represents almost everything that is wrong with the left: He accused the president of doing what the left does on a daily basis. He needs to step back and take a look at Democrats who have made a living selling their bull for decades. \nWe can begin with Clinton, who remains the queen of lies, manipulation and indifference to the truth . \nZakaria, who hosts his own show on CNN and has actually said this of the president before, peppered his commentary with profanity to add drama, as if to bolster his argument and get attention. However, he isn’t proving anything but how low the network will go to insult the president and get ratings. \nIn reality, these episodes only embarrass the failing network.
