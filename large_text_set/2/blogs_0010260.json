PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Mon, Feb 13, 2017 GETTY Peers have planned an attack on Theresa May's Brexit bill \nLabour and Lib Dem members of the upper house promised a deluge of amendments to delay the legislation needed to give the Prime Minister power to activate the European Union ’s Article 50 departure clause. \nTheir bid to tamper with the Government’s EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill is expected to lead to a stand-off between the Lords and the Commons that could upset her schedule of triggering the start of Brexit talks by the end of next month. \nA string of peers including Lord Newby, the Lib Dem’s leader in the Lords and Labour frontbencher Baroness Chakrabarti yesterday threatened to amend the Bill when Parliament returns from a half-term break on February 20.

GETTY Theresa May wants to trigger Article 50 by the end of March \n“I’m not saying that’s Lord Newby’s motive but I think it’s the motive of some of the people coming forward with these amendments – it’s to get embroiled in a time wasting, time delaying exercise.” \nHe said any perceived blocking by the upper house would cause outrage and could prompt calls for reform. \nSenior Tory MP Oliver Letwin, a former minister, said: will of the British people, which the people expressed in a referendum and which the Commons expressed in an overwhelming vote.
