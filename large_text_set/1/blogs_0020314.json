McCain (DDG 56) arrived in Subic Bay, Philippines, Jan. 23, for a brief port call that highlights the strong community and military connections between the Philippines and the United States. \nThe McCain crew will participate in a series of community service projects and sporting events during the crewâ€™s visit to the Philippines. \nThe ship will also use the stop to conduct some minor repairs with the assistance of Filipino companies. \nThe Philippines is a longstanding treaty ally of the United States with a more than 70-year history of partnership. The American and Philippine militaries have worked closely together on areas of mutual interest such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, counter terrorism, cybersecurity and maritime security. \nMcCain is forward-deployed to the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations in support of security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T09:28:35.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
