It's \"our\" day, after all. As journalists who also happen to be women (the majority of us are, at iDiva, for no other reason other than the stars aligning, we assure you), we felt the pressure of representing something that truly mattered to us, without pandering to the added stress of page views and clicks. Which is why we decided to speak straight from the heart. All the stories you see in the video below are a 100 percent real. If it resonates with you, it is because our stories, are your stories. \nThere's a whole host of topics discussed here, ranging from one's appearance to heartbreak to the very real issue of our existence; the reaction to a daughter being born as opposed to a son. These are all ongoing conversations. We choose to highlight them on Women's Day, but the struggle is real, every day, for all women. We'd like to think this video functions as a reminder, to never be a silent spectator. The time to speak is now. Do you see someone going through a tough time? Offer help. See someone in trouble? Be a pillar of strength. Reach out, shout and cause a commotion when you must, and watch what comes out of your mouth because words are powerful. \nThe message we'd like to leave you with is twofold: there is hope, but it doesn't lie in isolation. We've read the hundreds of messages on our walls, in response to this video. Each of them, from every single one of you, has something to say and to share. What's even more heartening is that fact that strangers have offered up so many kind words in support of ... all of it. The pain, the body issues, the bullying: we've seen you, as a collective, be so kind to others. Can this be our reality? Can we as women, and as human beings, stand up in solidarity? Can we be rays of hope in a world that is filled with trials and tribulations? Think about that the next time you look at yourself in the mirror. You Matter. We Matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:44:38.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
