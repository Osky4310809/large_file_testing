Commuters blast Holborn hologram that sings 'standing puns' at escalators \nThe standing-only escalators were able to carry an average of 151 passengers per minute, compared to 115 on the “traditional” escalator, according to the study. \nBut Underground bosses today revealed they have no plans to trial the scheme more widely. \nWhile congestion was cut on longer escalators, where the left-hand side is used by only a hardy few leaving large gaps in between, there was no improvement on shorter flights where more people are willing to walk. \nThe cut-off point was found to be 60ft, around halfway between Stratford’s 13ft rise and Angel’s 90ft. \nCommuters today welcomed the decision to end the scheme, described at the time as “going against everything about being British”. Standing escalator trial starts at Holborn, but Londoners ignore it \nJohanna Whitaker, 35, a communications consultant from West Hampstead, said: “I used the Tube at least twice a day during the trial, always in rush hour. \n“Standing on the left broke London commuter etiquette. There was always the danger of people thinking they could stand on the left at other tube stations - can you imagine? \n“The congestion at Holborn station is bad so Fair play to TfL for trying it, but I hope there’s a better way. They should bring back the hologram though, she was great.” \nDenise Baron, 29, a political researcher, said: “There are bigger fish to fry. I’m happy to skip up the escalator on my way to work while TfL is hopefully focusing on making commutes safer, more affordable and cleaner. \n“Plus, hustling up the escalators is my favourite form of cardio.” \nMark Evers, director of customer strategy for London Underground, said they were pleased with the “success” of the escalator trial but added: “Although there are no current plans to trial this scheme more widely, initiatives to make customer journeys quicker and more comfortable are constantly being tested across the TfL network. \n“As London’s population grows, developing potential solutions to reduce congestion will ensure that our customers continue to receive the best possible service.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T09:30:52.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
