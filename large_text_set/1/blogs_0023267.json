Gerrard is taking it one step at a time at Melwood (Photo: Getty) \nGerrard, who will combine his coaching role and working as a pundit for BT Sport, said: “To become a good player, you have got to do an apprenticeship and learn certain values. \n“You have to learn how the profession works, you have to watch first-team players who are better than you. Gerrard is combining his coaching role with being a pundit on BT Sport (Photo: BT Sport) \n“You learn the good and the bad off senior players, you get close to them – and, when you are ready, you dislodge them – that’s when you move in. \n“I don’t see management as being much different. I’ve put the cones out before and I’ve pumped up the footballs. \n“I even used to clean the staff toilets – when Joe Corrigan was in there! I’ve now got dreams and aspirations about one day being a manager or a coach. Gerrard is back where it all began (Photo: Getty) \n“And to have the opportunity to learn and develop at the club I love, among my own people, is a massive thrill for me.” \nKlopp was instrumental in bringing Gerrard home. \nOpportunities to work at Premier League and senior level were offered to Stevie G. \nBut Gerrard felt it would be better to put himself on a learning curve rather than a fast-track to possible oblivion. \nHe said: “The name you had on the back of your shirt can become a problem. \n“It’s not necessarily the players concerned, it’s the fact that other people get excited and want to put big opportunities in front of you. Klopp was key in bringing Gerrard back (Photo: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty) \n“I had them, chances to be a No.1 or a No.2, but I understood that, if you take the wrong ­opportunity at the wrong time and act on reputation, sentiment or emotion, then you could find it hard. \n“Just because you’ve been a good player doesn’t mean you are going to be a great manager. \n“I don’t want to name names because that would be ­disrespectful, but I have seen it so many times. \n“Management is so brutal. I think it would have been very stupid and immature to go into a position when I wasn’t ready.” \n“I decided there’s no rush. If it takes me five or 10 years, I don’t care because, at the moment, I’m not ready for the jobs I would ultimately want.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T00:24:29.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
