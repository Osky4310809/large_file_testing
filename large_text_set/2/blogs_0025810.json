Now, McNett is captain of the USA Ice Team. If you’d like to find your way in, McNett says he and his teammates are happy ambassadors for the sport. “Just reach out online, and we’ll connect you with a few experienced anglers in your area,” he says. You can also make your way to a local bait shop to see what the guys have to say. \nBefore you dive in, however, it’s smart to consider what can go wrong. Here’s how to prevent common ice fishing injuries. Strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal injuries \nIce fishing injuries tend to be more severe than injuries suffered during traditional fishing, according to a study published last year in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine . The data, based on emergency room visits between 2009 and 2014, also revealed that musculoskeletal problems – strains, sprains, etc. – were by far the most common type of ice fishing injury, accounting for nearly half of all ice-fishing-related trips to the ER. \nMcNett says wrist sprains are easily the most frequent injury he’s encountered among fellow enthusiasts. That’s because the auger – the device ice fishermen use to cut through the ice – is both powerful and unpredictable in the hands of someone who is inexperienced. \n“They don’t always break through cleanly, and that last cut, where the water meets the ice, will often jar the auger because there’s so much torque on them,” McNett says. The first body part affected is the wrist, but guys with weak backs might also experience pain following a serious auger slip. \nThe easiest way to avoid this problem is to use a hand auger as opposed to one that’s powered by electricity or propane. “That way you’re in control,” McNett says. “We’re required to use hand augers for competitions, but I use them when I’m fishing for fun, too. It’s a good workout.” \nIt’s also not uncommon to see inexperienced ice fishermen wipe out after getting overly enthusiastic on the ice. Footwear is key to a fall-free ice fishing trip, especially when there’s no snow on the ice to add traction. Use microspikes to help you avoid a head crash or elbow smash, which could sideline you for the season. We like Kahtoola MICROspikes ( Buy them here .) \nRelated: How to Fall On Your Butt without Breaking Your Neck Extreme weather \nWhen you go ice fishing, you’re going to be cold. Shocker, right? Preventing frostbite and other cold-related conditions is as straightforward as you might expect: Cover up as much of your body as you can, and don’t be stupid about going out in sub-zero temperatures for hours and hours. \n“In a place like the Dakotas, you might not have a choice,” McNett says, “but I try not to go out if the temperature drops below 20 degrees Fahrenheit.” \nSomething you might not consider before going out, however, is the danger posed by the sun. “Guys don’t know how bad the sun is when it reflects off the snow and ice,” McNett says. “I’ve got the raccoon eyes, and so do most ice fishermen I know.” \nEven though it’s cold, the sun doesn’t stop shining, so sunscreen is a must. Take your usual precautions when you plan to spend extended time outdoors, and if you need some guidance, we’ve got you covered . Hooked skin \nOne of the more gruesome ice fishing injuries can occur when a hook goes rogue and embeds itself in your skin. \n“Everything in the ice fishing world is exponentially smaller, so the points on hooks are sharper, and you’re more likely to get hooked by them than you are when you go fishing in the summer,” McNett says. \nThankfully, the fact that the hooks are so small means they aren’t hard to extricate. If someone you know gets a hook in their hand, count to three and pull on two, McNett says. \nSeek medical attention if the situation is more severe. Falls through the ice \nWhile wrist sprains are the most common ice fishing injuries, submersion is the most dangerous. “We lose people every year due to a fall through the ice,” McNett says. “It’s usually because they go out too early.” \nHe says ice fishing season generally lasts between late December and early March, though this may vary depending on where you live and the particular weather conditions that year. \nIf you’re unsure about ice being safe to stand on, strike it with an ice chisel. If you hit the same spot twice, it’s probably safe, McNett says. If you spot flow or runoff nearby, it’s probably not safe. \nDon’t have a chisel? Make your own. “All you need is a handle and a sharp nail,” McNett says. “String it with a bungee cord or something similar so you can keep it around your neck while you’re on the ice.” \nThere’s also a lot of gear out there to help you in case you do fall in. All the USA Ice Team members wear floating suits, and all ice fishing expeditions should include a flotation device or a rescue throw bag. Either will keep you calm even as your body screams from the cold and get you back on land with minimal harm. These can be purchased online or at many outdoor equipment stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:02:14.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
