In fact, death rates are 30 percent higher for white Americans aged 50 to 54 than for blacks overall in that same age range. \nThe main causes of the spike in death rates among white Americans are what the authors call “deaths of despair,” stemming from drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and a slowdown in progress made against heart disease and cancer–two of the largest killers in the U.S. \nSome of the so called “deaths of despair” are already well reported, like drug abuse and an uptick in suicide rates. \nThe opioid crisis has hit white Americans far harder than any other racial or socioeconomic group, devastating small rural communities and white middle-class neighborhoods. The rise in suicide rates is seen in towns like Butte, Montana , where growing economic inequality and lack of access to quality mental health care are leading citizens who feel left behind to commit suicide. The state of Montana’s suicide rate is almost twice the national average, growing 7.4 percent in 2014. \nThe trend began among white non-Hispanics aged 45 to 54 in 2000, and was relegated to the southwest. Within just 5 years, by the mid-2000s, it had spread throughout Appalachia, into Florida and even the West Coast. Researchers found the phenomenon is nation-wide in 2017. \nNon-Hispanic whites comprise some 62 percent of the U.S. population. The litany of ills faced by this group in no small part helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who promised the beleaguered group an avenue to “Make America Great Again.” \nThe professors warn that the causes are so complex that it will likely take many years to reverse the course. \nSend tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
