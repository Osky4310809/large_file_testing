Spanning everything from rose-gold unicorn brushes to these LUSH bubble bars , unicorn-themed goods are right up there with those inspired by our mermaid friends. Urban Decay may have just topped them all, however (yes, even Too Faced’s Unicorn Tears lipstick !), with its newest collection of shimmery, sparkly, lipstick topcoats. \nThe company known for its world famous Naked palette and its bold, daring colors is at it again with its Vice Special Effects topcoat ($18). Meant to be applied over your favorite lipstick, it’s a long-lasting, water resistant, intensely pigmented gloss that instantly adds a shimmery, sparkly, dramatic sheen to just about any look. \nWith colors like “3rd Degree” (a golden glitter), “Bruja” (berry with gold pearl sparkles), “Litter” (iridescent sparkle), and plenty more bright blues, purples and pinks, it’s simple enough for even the most glitter-impaired among us to use with ease: It sets fast, won’t smudge off, and packs a bright and powerful punch to any color you already happen to be rocking. \nWith a precision applicator, and it’s under $20 price-tag, we’re sure that we won’t be the only ones in line when it drops later this month (March 23 on the Urban Decay website , and the 31st at Sephora ). \nWill you rock sparkle lips this spring and summer? Tell us about it @BritandCo ! \n(h/t POPSUGAR , photos via Urban Decay, Stewart C.
