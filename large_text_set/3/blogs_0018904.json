(Greg McBoat Photography, Special to The Denver Post) \nOn a Saturday morning, I headed to Pizzeria Locale with my husband, daughter, son and a dinosaur. \nWe were all there to learn to make their perfect pizza dough – OK, maybe not the dinosaur, since he’s made of plastic and all, but the rest of us were — in the hopes that we could replicate the cloud-like, chewy crust at home. \nRe-creating one of our favorite pizzas on-demand whenever we craved it was only part of why we gathered at Locale, though. I’ve always heard that children should learn to cook, and I, not being the most patient or most proficient cook, am not the one to teach them. So, on that Saturday at least, that job went to Steven Benjamin, our very game and enthusiastic pizza coach. \n“So there will be five, then?” Steven asked upon seeing the dinosaur, a perma-companion of my 3-year-old son, Sam. \nUnfazed by both the screeching children and Sam’s extinct BFF, Steven got to work, first explaining the history of Locale and then getting into the science behind the dough. Because they’re geniuses (or because their mom is a dough-obsessed food writer), Sam and Austen, 5, were able to recite the four ingredients of a basic pizza dough – flour, water, salt, yeast – and quasi-explain that yeast helps the dough to rise. \nThen we got to the fun part, mixing and playing with the dough. We all aproned up – except the dinosaur; they didn’t have his size – and folded and pressed our soft mounds into stretchy, sturdy little balls. \nSam probably ate his weight in flour, but he had a good time doing it, so carry on, kid. Carry on. \nWe shaped our little dough spheres into flat, 11-inch orbs, which Steven and his associates then topped with sauce, cheese, a whole lot of pineapple (the kids), and a whole lot of prosciutto and peppers (the parents). We watched as the pizzas took their 3½-minute turn around the 900-degree gas-fired oven, emerging beautifully charred and bubbly. \nAs we ate our creations – or three of us did; Sam was full after eating so much flour – I had a rare moment of feeling like a fairly adequate mom. I hadn’t screamed at anyone for leaving Legos all over the floor, my kids had learned to cook good food made from real ingredients, and we did it together, as a family. \nDinosaur and all. Sam and Austen Hathaway get help from their parents in making pizza dough during a kids class at Pizzeria Locale, 550 Broadway, Denver.

Add flour and combine until dough starts to form. There should be no excess flour. Sprinkle salt evenly over the dough and gently fold the dough over and over until salt is evenly distributed and clumps are gone. (About a minute or less.) On a lightly floured work surface, gently fold the dough in half, turn 90 degrees, and fold in half again. Do this 5 times. Place dough in metal bowl, cover with plastic and let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature. Repeat the last step two more times. Each time, the dough should get smoother and spongier. Do one more round of folds, but this time put the bowl in the refrigerator for 18 hours. (It will last up to 36 hours. Pull the dough out of the refrigerator and cut into quarters. Form each quarter into a small ball, using the same folding technique as before. Place the balls into a bowl and lightly cover with plastic wrap; let rise at room temperature for 3-5 hours. Preheat oven to 500 degrees with a pizza stone for 25 minutes. Place the dough in a shallow pile of flour (both sides) and press and stretch the dough to create a middle and crust, about 10 inches. Pass the dough back and forth between your open hands until the pizza is about 11 inches in diameter, dusting off all the flour in the process. Top pizza how you like, place on stone and bake for approximately 7 minutes. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:49:19.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
