He is the game’s most successful stallion ever here, going great guns again in the 2016-17 season. \n\"Thistlecrack is his masterpiece and confirmation that Kayf Tara can sire a horse of the very greatest talent, as well as delivering winners and sales successes from all manner of mares. \n\"We are very fortunate that he is hale and hearty at the age of 23 and we dearly hope he stays that way, as his book is full for 2017.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:51:15.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
