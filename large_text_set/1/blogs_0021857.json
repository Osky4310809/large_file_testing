Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTheresa May does not have the power to trigger Article 50 after she suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Supreme Court . \nAll 11 members of the highest court in the land took part in the decision, the most significant constitutional court case in recent history. \nThey decided by a majority of 8 to three that she must consult Parliament before triggering Article 50 . \nBut the court ruled unanimously that the decision is for the House of Commons to decide on Brexit , and the Prime Minister does not have to consult the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. \nThe result means MPs will get a vote in Parliament on whether to kick off the Brexit process. \nAnd more importantly, they’ll be allowed to debate and scrutinise the bill which triggers it. \nHowever, it’s thought the bill - which the Prime Minister has said she will pass by the end of March - could be just two clauses long, leaving little scope for MPs to amend it. \nAnnouncing the ruling, Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, said the issues at hand “have nothing to do with whether the UK should exit from the EU, or the terms or timetable for the exit.” Read More Campaigner Gina Miller arrives at the Supreme Court in Parliament Square.
