The correction value for Sharp and/or Heavy weapons upgrades has been improved, as has the Bleed build-up of Blood infusions and the Poison build-up of Poison infusions. \n\"Along with improving correction value for Sharp or Heavy weapons' upgrade, adjusted correction value for Refined weapons' upgrade,\" reads update 1.1's patch notes.
