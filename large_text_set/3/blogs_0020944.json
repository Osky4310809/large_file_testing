Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWayne Rooney has been ruthlessly axed by Gareth Southgate - with no guarantee of an England return. \nDespite a striker crisis, Southgate has decided to do without his captain and the nation's record goal-scorer, who is fit, for next week’s games against Germany and Lithuania. \nAnd he is considering scrapping the tradition of the Three Lions having a permanent skipper. \nRooney, 31 , has only started once for Manchester United in the Premier League since mid-December and only scored two goals in three-and-a-half months. \nHe has been replaced in the squad by Sunderland's 34-year-old Jermain Defoe, who won his last cap in 2013.

Both are playing very well, scoring and assisting for their clubs. Ross Barkley has been playing very well for his club. So there’s competition. \n\"I can’t dress that up any other way. \n‘Wayne is not ruled out for the weekend [when United play Middlesbrough]. But there is also a need for others to step forward. We have this thing about ‘an England captain’, but really the captain is the person who is captain in the next game.” \nSouthgate also revealed he was angrily challenged by Theo Walcott over his omission from the squad — which was announced on the Arsenal forward's 28th birthday.

And I understand that,\" said Southgate. \n“Quite rightly, he said, ‘I’m one of the leading goal-scorers in the league’. \n\"I don’t mind being challenged on that at all. I totally respect that. I don’t expect him to be happy. But I’ve got to make decisions and I think it was the right think to call him to talk that through — even though the timing [his birthday] probably wasn’t great.” \nSouthgate will no longer indulge players struggling with injuries or unable to make it into their club sides, despite keeping faith with Manchester United's little-used left-back Luke Shaw. \nHe added: “The physical part of how we play is quite crucial. Rooney broke Bobby Charlton's England goals record — but has he now scored his last?

I want a team with a lot of energy. \n\"So if you are a bit short of match fitness with your club, to make that jump internationally is going to be a tough call because generally that [playing for England] takes more energy. The week can take more out of you. \n\"If you’re not getting those minutes regularly for your club, it’s harder to hit that level.” SQUAD TO PLAY GERMANY AND LITHUANIA \nGoalkeepers Fraser Forster, Joe Hart, Tom Heaton \nDefenders Ryan Bertrand, Gary Cahill, Nathaniel Clyne, Phil Jones, Michael Keane, Luke Shaw, Chris Smalling, John Stones, Kyle Walker. \nMidfielders Dele Alli, Michail Antonio, Ross Barkley, Eric Dier, Adam Lallana, Jesse Lingard, Jake Livermore, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Nathan Redmond, Raheem Sterling, James Ward-Prowse. \nStrikers Jermain Defoe, Marcus Rashford, Jamie Vardy. poll loading Has Wayne Rooney scored his last England goal? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:57:22.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
