After toppling then-No. 3 Grandview on Jan. 6 to hand the Wolves their first loss of the season, Arapahoe spiraled, losing eight consecutive league games. \nBut, as coach Brad Jansen explained, the Warriors kept the faith. They knew their RPI would get them into the state tournament, and from there their belief in each other—along with the return of 6-foot-7 senior center Ben Timmons from a broken foot suffered early in the season—gave them the chance to re-write their legacy. \n“Since we’ve gotten Timmons back, we’ve had a new life about ourselves,” Jansen said. “The guys kept buying in, and going into Doherty—a great team in front of a great home crowd down there—we had a belief about us, and we thought that if we could do the things we could do, we could beat them.” \nWith Simmons attracting increased attention down low, fellow senior center Jared Johnson dropped a career-high 20 points against the Spartans while senior guard Kyle Lukasiewicz led the team with 32 points. Plus, clutch performances by junior guard Drew Hayes and senior wing Will Otten in the Warriors’ opening-round tournament 47-44 win over No. 38 Pine Creek—a game in which Arapahoe erased a five-point deficit with 1:06 to play—proved this year’s team won’t give in. \n“Perseverance is what we preach,” Jansen said. “Three weeks ago when we had lost eight games in a row, and we didn’t have Timmons back, it was hard. Practice was hard. You’ve got guys that want to win but know playing in the Centennial League is as tough as it gets. They could have quit and turned it in, but I challenged Kyle and I challenged the rest of my seniors, and we got a few wins there late in the season and obviously that changed a lot.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:04:32.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
