It all started when Miz Walls slid into Javi's DM on Instagram , and the two couldn't stop talking!\n\"I love that he is a gentleman... And I like his core values and that he has morals and just what he stands for.\" \nFor their first date, the new couple dined at Marroquin's favorite restaurant in Philadelphia! According to Kailyn Lowry 's ex: \n\"We enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and then later I had my friends come out to meet her and we all went out and danced and drank and just had a really good time... It was awesome.\" \nThings are going so well, the 24-year-old hunk plans to travel to her hometown of Austin, TX to see her stomping grounds.\nAlthough both are parents, they have NOT met each other's children yet. Javi says:\n\"I haven't introduced [Madison] to [my son] Lincoln yet. I learned from my past mistakes where I introduced him way too early on in a relationship, so now I know better.\" \nMadison chimed in by saying:\n\"I'm really excited for him to come to Austin next month.

I'm happy for Kail. I wish her nothing but the best and health and wellness and all of that stuff you know? I'm here for her. We actually are in a good place and I just want health for her and the baby. Lincoln is actually the one who told me she was having a baby... He knows what's going on.
