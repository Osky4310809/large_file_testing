These features line up with services that Spotify offers, making Sonalytic a natural fit for the company, it seems. \nSpotify doesn’t provide much detail on its plans for integrating Sonalytic with its service, only saying that its audio detection feature will be used to do things like improve personalized playlists and match songs with compositions to improve its publishing data system. The company also teases that users can “stay tuned” for new products that will come to market, thanks to Sonalytic’s help. \nLondon-based Sonalytic, founded last summer, was not a consumer-facing business, but rather offered both a web-based interface for low-volume customers of its technology, as well as an API for larger customers. \nIt explains on its website that it had developed a next-gen approach to audio identification that’s “robust to changes in pitch and tempo, the addition of background noise, distortion, filtering, compression, looping, EQing and much more.” Even with small sample clips as short as one second in length, its technology is capable of identifying the track – whether chord or vocal. And its can be used to identify not just songs, but also musical stems found within derivative works. \nThat latter feature could help Spotify in its music recommendation service, as it would be able to connect different songs that share similar sounds, perhaps. \nMeanwhile, its monitoring technology could come into play on Spotify as part of its larger analytics suite for artists, publishers and labels. Sonalytic is about to track the use of material, and users’ related listening habits. It even developed technology for use at real-world events, like concerts, which could offer “Now Playing” information to users. (Oh, please, build this one, Spotify). \nThe company had also developed machine-learning based music recommendation technology that can help find music you like based on user feedback, context (workout, road trips, etc), and the listening habits of the wider world. \nSonalytic’s founding team consists of Martin Gould, CEO, and Thomas Walther, CTO, according to the company’s AngelList profile . John Atherton is listed on LinkedIn as a Director. \nThe startup itself emerged from Imperial Create Lab , which has an undisclosed stake in its business, according to CrunchBase. Patrick Schneider-Sikorsky, a partner at Beast Ventures, also lists the startup as one of his investments. \nAccording to a Q&A with the team posted by Create Lab last year, the startup was inspired to create technology that could aid with the declining revenues in the music business,: \n“Even though people are listening to more music than ever before, the associated revenues have been in sustained decline for more than a decade,” the post read. “Ultimately, artists — and particularly smaller, independent artists — are losing out, to the extent it’s necessary for many musicians to work a second job to fund their passion. We believe that by helping to monetize music in new and innovative ways, this broken model can be fixed. Music is our passion, and we truly believe that technological innovations can be the solution to this difficult problem,” it said. \nSpotify wouldn’t comment or answer any questions about the acquisition, beyond providing the following statement: The Sonalytic team has joined Spotify to accelerate our ability to improve the music ecosystem for artists and fans. Their advancements in audio feature detection will be used to enhance Spotify’s personalized playlists, ensure Spotify’s catalog remains spam free, and match songs with compositions to enable faster payouts to publishers. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:55:43.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
