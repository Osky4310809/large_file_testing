King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 11 Mastodon bassist/vocalist Troy Sanders said he sees vocal delivery as one of the definite highlights of the band's upcoming, yet-untitled studio album.Last month, the boys revealed the record was pretty much complete, and that the central theme revolves around time and cancer.Anyhow, asked by Rolling Stone on what we can expect from the effort in sonic terms, Troy replied:\"We always want to up our vocal performances with each album, but we're players first and foremost.\"The current highlight of the new record for me is the way Brent [Hinds], Brann [Dailor] and myself approached the vocals and honed in on the best patterns and tones and melodies we could find.\"When we walked out of the studio in November, we were all high-fiving because we're proud of one another. That's a certain amount of success already achieved.\" He concluded: \"I think what sets us apart is that we have these four characters who blend to make this unique chemistry. The fact that 17 years into it, and 8 records later, it's still the four of us trying to ascend the mountain that we're building, trying to further this unique path that we're carving in the world of rock & roll.\"During the rest of the chat, the musician noted: \"Mastodon tends to reflect on what we are living and experiencing between album cycles. That's what we use as energy, for better or worse; then we write stories and songs that become full albums.\"That's an honest reflection of what the four of us have been living and breathing for the entire year of writing and recording the record. We tend to channel our energies through art to attempt creating a positive from darkness. We're incredibly excited to have a record coming out in the spring and then continue touring the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:01:59.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
