The Highlights \nLet’s get the bad news out first. Several classic series are leaving Netflix. From my probably incorrect memory, a few of these have been with Netflix since the start of streaming. Okay, here we go then, you ready? Because this is going to hurt. Here are some of the shows leaving Netflix April 1: Firefly , The X-Files , Angel , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Dollhouse , House , Bones , Ally McBeal , and Roswell . Movies aren’t safe either, with The Princess Bride , Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, and The Usual Suspects all leaving at the beginning of the month too. I know, it doesn’t feel great. Take a second. There’s good news though. Advertisement \nThe new Mystery Science Theater series arrives April 14 and Bill Nye’s new show, Bill Nye Saves the World arrives April 21. Also coming back are the The Get Down and Chewing Gum , alongside a handful of interesting looking new shows, like, Girlboss and Dear White People . \nNew Netflix movies are also on the way, including the already-maligned live-action Death Note, which features white people in a remake of a Japanese anime—something that we all know people love . If that wasn’t enough, Death Note is directed by the same guy behind the 2016 Blair Witc h movie and one of the writers also worked on the 2014 Fantastic Four and the 2016 The Exorcist .

You remember those Adam Sandler classics, right? Also on the way is a stylized documentary about JonBenét, Casting JonBenét , which looks like a fittingly bizarre take on an already very-weird story. \nNon-Netflix movies arriving this month include The BFG , which was supposed to arrive last month but apparently was delayed, Gremlins , Schindler’s List , and The Prestige , a film that’s so Christopher Nolan-y that just reading the title of the movie puts your brain in a “figure it out” mode. Spoiler, there’s a twist revealed at the end! Also Christian Bale has a moody mustache .
