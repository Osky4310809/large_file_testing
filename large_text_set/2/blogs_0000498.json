Bush to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006 after serving in Bush’s Justice Department. \nNo stranger to the Supreme Court, Gorsuch clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. He would be the first former law clerk to serve on the court alongside his or her old boss if confirmed. \nA friend of Scalia’s, Gorsuch called the late justice a “lion of the law” when he died in 2016 and he has articulated a similarly strict interpretation of the meaning of the Constitution. Gorsuch has become known in legal circles for the rhetorical flourishes in his judicial opinions, a characteristic that was also frequently attributed to Scalia. \n\"Judge Gorsuch has a superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its text,\" Trump said. \"He will make an incredible Justice as soon as the Senate confirms him.\" Judge Neil Gorsuch (C) and his wife Marie Louise look on, after US President Donald Trump nominated him for the Supreme Court, at the White House in Washington, DC, on January 31, 2017.

Both judges were summoned to Washington on Tuesday, adding an element of game-show-like suspense to Trump’s decision. \nIf confirmed, Gorsuch -- a graduate of Harvard Law School -- would extend a long streak of jurists from Ivy League law schools on the court. Every current Supreme Court justice went to either Harvard or Yale, as has been the case since Northwestern-educated Justice John Paul Stevens retired in 2010. \nGorsuch is now set to face a political gauntlet as the Senate prepares to consider his nomination for approval.

Ted Cruz has responded that Republicans will leave “all procedural options on the table” to ensure the nominee is confirmed, including the “ nuclear option ” of changing the Senate’s filibuster rules. \nCruz, who attended the White House event unveiling Trump's nominee, heaped praise on Gorsuch in a written statement, calling him \"brilliant and immensely talented.\" \n\"As a result of his fidelity to law, he has proven to be a champion of federalism, the constitutional separation of powers, religious liberty, and all of the fundamental liberties enshrined in our Bill of Rights,\" Cruz said. \"I couldn't be happier with his selection.\" \nCruz's senior Texas colleague, Sen. John Cornyn , also weighed in with strong approval of the nomination -- and an eye towards the confirmation vote ahead. \n\"The President has picked a mainstream nominee unanimously supported by Democrats in the past,\" Cornyn said. \"I hope my colleagues across the aisle will allow an up-or-down vote on this bipartisan, highly qualified nominee.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:44:12.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
