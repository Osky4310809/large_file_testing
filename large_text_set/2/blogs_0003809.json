Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters   01.24   01.27 GMT \nThe longest-living fish in a zoological setting, a lungfish known as Granddad acquired by the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago in 1933, has been euthanised after suffering failing health well in his mid-90s. \nGranddad, who came to Shedd from Australia in anticipation of the 1933-34 Chicago World’s Fair, was seen by more than 104 million people during his time in Chicago, aquarium president Bridget Coughlin said in a statement on Monday announcing his death.

The aquarium said Granddad was euthanised after losing interest in food and showing signs of organ failure. \nLungfish, which are native to the Mary and Burnett rivers in Queensland, Australia, have a single primitive lung and are among the few fish that can breathe air.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:39:38.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
