Ike Nwachukwu, said there was the need for leaders of today to give the younger generation opportunity to lead and serve the country. \nNwachukwu, who is also a former Senator, however, said that for such opportunity to be effective, the younger generation, too, must be prepared to be mentored. \nThe lecture was part of activities lined up for the institution’s 2016 convocation. \nThe convocation proper begins on Jan. 24, with the award of degrees, certificates and prizes to students found ‘’worthy in character and learning.’’ \nNAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T11:17:26.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
