The attack, which left one dead and another wounded, has sparked outrage across the country and in India, with many blaming President Trump and his rhetoric on refugees and immigration.\n“As more facts come to light and it begins to look like this was an act of racially motivated hatred,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.\n“I want to reiterate the President condemns these or any other racially or religiously motivated attacks in the strongest terms,” she said. “They have no place in our country.”\nPresident Trump has come under fire in recent days for not publicly addressing the shooting of Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, both 32, last Wednesday at Austin’s Bar and Grill in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe.\nAdam Purinton, 51, is charged with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder for killing Kuchibhotla and wounding Madasani. He also shot and injured 24-year-old Ian Grillot after he tried to intervene.\nWitnesses later told cops that Purinton had yelled “get out of my country” before opening fire.\nThe FBI announced Tuesday that it was now investigating the shooting as a hate crime.\nGrillot, who is still in the hospital, called on Trump to condemn the incident earlier in the day — and urged him to show some compassion for those affected by the situation.\n“People are just emotionally distraught…So it would be nice to have some kind of address about it and a little bit of closure for everyone in mourning and everybody struggling with this hard time right now,” Grillot told CNN.\nSEE ALSO \nVictim wants Trump to address ‘get out of my country’ shooting 0:0 The 24-year-old hero who took a bullet when he tried...
