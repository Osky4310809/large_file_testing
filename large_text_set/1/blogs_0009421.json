They had no clothes, no shoes and this is Yuletide season. They looked up to me to take care of these expenses. \n“It was about three months now that I left Mr Ekinodo. I had worked for him for four years before leaving him in August. I left because he had a little challenge and things were pretty tough for him. I left so that he could have himself sorted out. \n“He was a very nice boss to work with. He enrolled me into university but I couldn’t continue the education when I left him. While he had this challenge, he owed me eight months salary; this prompted me to take his property and the vehicle. \n“The auto dealer wanted to pay N2 million for the car but I insisted on N4 Million because I know it is worth more than that. He offered me N1million instantly and that the balance would be ready in about few minutes time, but I decided to ignore the offer hoping that the dealer would call me back for a re-negotiation. \n“I went back to Ojuelegba few hours later in company of three of my friends, that was when RRS operatives arrested us.” \nEkinodo said: “I am in shock. This is a guy I treated like a son. Apart from my wife, he was the closest person to me. This is a guy that did my shopping for me. Even, before I buy anything for myself, I bought for him first. How can I owe him eight– month salary when he never worked for me in those periods? Did he inform me that I owed him? He was never in my house in the periods he claimed. I called him more than twice when I got the report of the break in. He told me he knew nothing about it. If he had told me he needed money, I would have given him because we were still very close despite the fact that he was no longer working for me.” \nPolice spokesperson Dolapo Badmos, a Superintendent (SP) urged members of the public to always do a background check of their domestic staff so as not to expose themselves to criminals. \nShe said the suspects have been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) Yaba, for further investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T02:10:54.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
