But now, three years after the merger closed, leaders of the flight attendants union said the promised benefits from the merger haven’t materialized. \n“With this new administration, we were all pretty much behind it. We’ve gotten behind [CEO] Doug Parker and [President] Robert Isom ... because we believe they have what it takes to propel American,” said Bob Ross, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants. \n“It just has not transpired for us. Not in pay. Not in working conditions. We still do not have contracts where we’re all working together.” American Airlines labor discord stymies CEO racing to stay ahead of rivals \nIn addition to American’s headquarters, the flight attendants plan to hold pickets at the company’s hub airports in Miami, Los Angeles and Charlotte, N.C. \nAmerican hasn’t commented specifically on the pickets, but said it supports “the rights of our team members to voice their opinions.” \n“We will continue to work to address any concerns they have and support them the best we can,” American spokesman Matt Miller said. \nThe union has laid out a variety of different issues it wants American to address -- from scheduling to hotel accomodations to pay that lags their peers at other major airlines. \nAmerican accelerated a 6 percent raise due to flight attendants last April and also reinstituted profit-sharing for all employees last year. But Ross said the pay hasn’t kept pace with a new deal struck by United Airlines flight attendants and a raise given to Delta’s crew members. \nOverall, the complaints largely stem from the progress -- or lack thereof, in the union’s view -- on implementing a post-merger contract that combined the American Airlines and US Airways flight attendant groups. \nMany of the items in that contract are dependent on integrating those two groups, something that can’t be fully completed until American wraps up an overhaul of its technological systems. \nWhile American said integrating its flight attendants group is a top priority -- it completed a similar integration for pilots in September -- company executives have said it will probably be a year or more before all the work is done. \nIn the meantime, Ross said the contract is being implemented “piecemeal,” leaving legacy American and legacy US Airways flight attendants working under different rules in certain situations. \nThere’s also the issue of new uniforms American debuted in September that, within a week, had some flight attendants reporting adverse reactions including headaches, rashes and breathing problems. American Airlines flight attendants file 2,600 complaints, but uniform issues continue \nComplaints about the uniforms have continued to rise. The union said it has received more than 2,600 reports of medical issues so far, although the official number of reports filed with American is much lower. \nWhile American has insisted the uniforms are safe and multiple rounds of tests haven’t revealed a culprit, the sides are negotiating over another round of joint testing. A formal union grievance demanding a recall of the uniforms is also winding through the arbitration process. \nRoss said Tuesday’s picket isn’t about a single issue -- although the uniforms have been a major source of “dissatisfaction” -- and was instead triggered by an accumulation of problems the union feels aren’t being dealt with by American. \n“There comes a time where, in order to really drive your point home, you need to sit down and talk. [American] needs to see that it’s not just coming from [our] office, it’s coming from the streets,” Ross said. \n“It’s been one constant thing after another while they praise themselves for spending all this money on a new headquarters building, for refreshing the aircraft. The only ones they’re not investing in is their employees.” View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:10:48.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
