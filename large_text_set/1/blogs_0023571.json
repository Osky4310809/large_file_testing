His heroics, however, only held out their hosts until the 75th minute when Alex Alegria gave Betis a much-merited lead. Suarez's last-minute goal salvaged a point for Barcelona ( Getty ) \nLuis Suarez's last-minute equaliser salvaged the 1-1 for Luis Enrique's side but only after two chances had seemingly been cleared off the line by Betis defenders - one, on replay, which was a clear distance inside the goal. \nNeymar was no sooner in the changing rooms post-match than he had sent out a Snapchat to his followers, laughing wryly at the injustice while also claiming a penalty that was ignored. Neymar on Instagram pic.twitter.com/eQbslfm4d5 â€” Samuel Marsden (@samuelmarsden) January 29, 2017 \nParanoia over refereeing bias is one of the more tiresome characteristics of the clasico rivalry, and Barcelona's noisy media will not let this lie. \nBut the bigger issues for Luis Enrique must be addressed on the training ground this week. \nIvan Rakitic failed to provide the necessary fluency and direction in the Sergio Busquets role, filling in for one of world football's most irreplaceable players. Busquets' own underperformance this season has been one of the reasons behind their (relative) struggles but this is a side that is struggling to pull together all of their elements despite a glittering, superstar cast. Betis ' forward Alex Alegria celebrates after putting his side ahead ( Getty ) \nIt is one of the reasons that Luis Enrique has placed his own future in such doubt. There is a feeling that he can't get his pieces to meld together right now. They are struggling to click. \nBut these are complex things to resolve, questions of nuance and technical precision. \nIn a world of black and white, of over the line or not, there is only one issue that will fill the pages of newspapers in both Barcelona and Madrid over the coming days.
