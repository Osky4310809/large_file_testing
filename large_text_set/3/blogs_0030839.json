Patrick Dangerfield, Nat Fyfe and Gary Ablett, just to name a few. \nIn the AFL Record for Sunday‚Äôs clash between North Melbourne and the West Coast Eagles, two players were asked that question and many more in their ‚Äòpocket profiles‚Äô. \nEagle Andrew Gaff played a straight bat in his interview. He likes watching Ablett, loved David Neitz as a kid and wants to travel the world when he retires. \nBut young Kangaroo Kayne Turner sounded more like a Reddit user or Facebook commenter in his answers. \nHis favourite player to watch? Zac Dawson, of course. \nHis favourite player of all-time? None other than Richmond two-gamer and one-time SuperCoach heart-throb Relton Roberts. \nTurner would love to meet Po, Laa-Laa and Tinky-Winky from the Teletubbies ‚Äî but not Dipsy, obviously ‚Äî and next on his travel bucket list is Devonport. \nAlthough Gaff said if he could have any band play at the Grand Final it would be Nickelback, so perhaps he is the biggest troll of all. \nYou can enjoy Turner‚Äôs full set of answers below. Either way, AFL Confidential has a new favourite player. \nLISTEN TO THE LATEST FOX FOOTY PODCAST BELOW, OR TAP HERE TO SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES Kayne Turner's answers in his Footy Record interview.

That‚Äôs a lighter purple on the top, isn‚Äôt it? (Photo by Paul Kane/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images Look at Sandi. This isn‚Äôt crazy, is it?

(Photo by Will Russell/AFL Media/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images \nThe only explanation AFL Confidential can come up with is that the guernseys, which were special charity tops for the Starlight Foundation, are actually a bit lighter? \nFor comparison‚Äôs sake here's a photo of Fremantle‚Äôs normal look from the JLT series. That‚Äôs totally a darker purple.

Jax just said me to \"Mum whenever Dad leaves a team they get good... whenever he is playing, the team is terrible\" üòÇüòÇ cop that @Adamcooney17 \n‚ÄúMum whenever Dad leaves a team they get good... whenever he is playing, the team is terrible,‚Äù the youngster said. \nOuch. \n‚ÄòTHIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING... GO CROWS‚Äô \nIT was a heck of a weekend for footy in South Australia, with Port Adelaide surprising in a win over Sydney Swans. \nBut the Adelaide Crows took the instate chocolates by beating the premiership favourites in both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs leagues. The men‚Äôs team downed GWS on Sunday and the AFLW side beat the Brisbane Lions for the premiership. \nOne of the Crows‚Äô victorious captains was Chelsea Randall, but it appears her captaincy was so successful it also applies to air travel. ‚Äî Adelaide Crows (@Adelaide_FC) March 26, 2017 \nTHE BORING TWEET OF THE WEEK AWARD, PRESENTED BY JAMES HARMES \nAND the winner is...
