Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum has gone from having 'sagging granny skin' to the perfect bikini body after losing an incredible 11 stone . \nDonna Clayton, 33, ballooned to a hefty 18st 8lbs after years of consuming large portions of spaghetti and other carbohydrate-heavy meals. \nShe shed nearly 11 stone in nine months after a gastric bypass three years ago, but her 'sagging granny skin' and 'deflated breasts' made her weight loss feel 'worthless'. \nShe was so embarrassed that she refused to be naked in front of husband David - who decided to help demoralised Donna, from Missouri, US, by paying £7,000 ($9,000) for a tummy tuck, breast lift and implants . \nNow Donna's so happy with her look she's wearing a two-piece bikini for the first time in her life and can't wait to flaunt her new physique this summer.

I loved it and no longer am embarrassed as I know I look great.\" \nDonna piled on the pounds over the years after consuming massive portions of carbohydrate meals combined with sugary coffees. \nAt her heaviest, her body mass index stood at 56 - which put her into the World Health Organisation's highest level of obesity. \nDonna said: \"Throughout the day I was drinking Starbucks Mochas and just ate the wrong foods, the one large meal I would eat was always full of carbs.
