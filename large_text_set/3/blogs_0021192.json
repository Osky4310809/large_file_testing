Namely, the 500,000 jobs they've already created. \nHe was especially excited to tell coal miners they're going to be put back to work and his new EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt \"will turn the EPA from a job killer to a job creator.\" \nIn addition to these new jobs, the president said he fully intends to \"massively reduce\" our taxes as he gets to work on tax reform. However, he can't do that until the new health care bill is done. \n\"We're going to be working on this very closely\" with GOP leaders, Trump told the crowd. He noted that the crucial House vote on the American Health Care Act will come on Thursday, the seven-year anniversary of Obamacare, a law which he called \"the big lie.\" \n\"This is our long awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump said. \"We're going to do it.\" \nThe crowd held their breath when Trump mentioned Sen. Rand Paul. The Kentucky senator has been one of the loudest critics of the American Health Care Act, referring to it as Obamacare lite. He was a notable no show at Trump's rally, yet the president took a conciliatory tone. \n\"I happen to like Sen. Rand Paul,\" he said. \"He's a good guy and I look forward to working with him so we can get this bill passed in some form so we can pass massive tax reform.\" \nThe president noted he was adding certain features to the bill, such as a decrease in medicine prices. \nMedicine prices \"will be coming way down\" and it will \"happen fast,\" he said. \nTrump also took a few moments to mention that his Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is currently in his confirmation hearings and the Senate should approve him quickly because he is an \"outstanding man.\" \nSurprisingly, the FBI hearings on Russia did not come up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:04:22.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
