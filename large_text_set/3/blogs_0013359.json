After that, the animal ran back into the water,\" said Edy Carvalho, coach of Atletico. \n\"His two friends were very scared and they heard the screams, but there was nothing they could do. The crocodile was like five metres.\" \nThe club, named after the Brazilian team, posted a tribute to their player on their Facebook page, offering condolences to Gino's family. \n\"We are mourning our player, our brother, our friend, our son and our eternal central defender,\" reads the tribute. \n\"The CAMT sends our sincerest condolences to your family.
