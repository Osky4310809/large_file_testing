They were stopped from making the purchase at the checkout (Photo: Facebook) \nOn Wednesday, the Tesco store manager apologised to the pair and invited them to visit the branch to make amends. \n\"We got an apology and admittance that it was a bad judgment call,\" Michael told Mirror Online . \n\"Dean the manager was off on holiday last week and came back to a storm. He handled himself and the situation very well today.\" Tesco Brent Cross (Photo: Google) Read More Tesco refuses to serve man buying £200 worth of food for homeless \nMichael added: \"We at St. Laurence's Larder are very satisfied at the outcome and look forward to feeding many people tomorrow and the coming weekend. \" \nMichael said that Tesco gave him and Stephen a £100 gift voucher – half of what he had originally intended to spend last week. Tesco donated £100 to the cause (Photo: Mirror Online / Michael Taub) \nHe added that the company is looking into adding the North London charity to its list of food connection program. Tesco donates excess food to initiatives and community groups. \n\"We believe that no food that could be eaten should go to waste,\" the supermarket spiel reads on its website. \n\"Where we have good quality surplus food, it is supplied to charities and community groups that help to feed those in need.\" Lots of food, which will be going to people in need (Photo: Mirror Online / Michael Taub) Read More Chocolate lovers are only just realising why Kinder Surprise toy cases are yellow and it's blowing their minds \nMichael told Mirror Online that he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome. \n\"We [with Stephen] just bought loads of food for St. Laurence's,\" he said. \"We still spent £200 and invited Tesco to visit us at the larder, which they have agreed to do.\" Caption competition? (Photo: Mirror Online / Michael Taub) \nMichael and Stephen are volunteers at Saint Laurence's Larder , a community set-up which takes donations from individuals, religious organisations, and groups such as the Felix Project , which works with suppliers to redistribute excess food. \nThe organisation feeds up to 90 people every week who are in need of a decent meal. \nWe've asked Tesco to comment and are awaiting a reply.
