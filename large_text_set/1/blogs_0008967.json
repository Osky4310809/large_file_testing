Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nA former senior adviser to President Barack Obama announced Tuesday that he will lead the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s policy and advocacy work. \nDavid Plouffe, an Obama campaign veteran, former senior adviser to the president and senior vice president of policy and strategy at Uber, said he is “thrilled to be joining Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan on the journey to advance human potential and promote equal opportunity thru the work of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.” Story Continued Below \nZuckerberg, the Facebook founder, and his wife, Chan, announced the creation of the philanthropic organization in a letter to their daughter , Max, in December 2015, when they pledged $45 billion to fulfill their mission to advance human potential and advocate for equality among all children. \n“As the President of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Policy and Advocacy, my job will be to find creative ways to lift the voices of those who want to build a better future — no matter where they live, their background or their ideology,” Plouffe wrote in a Facebook post . “Curing disease, improving education through personalized learning and building technology and tools to help organizations reach their full potential are areas with wide spread support and massive potential for mobilization, great storytelling and smart policy engagement.” By Edward-Isaac Dovere \nPlouffe credited Zuckerberg and Chan for creating “a great team” — which includes Jim Shelton, president of Chan Zuckerberg Education; Cori Bargmann, president of Chan Zuckerberg Science; and Brian Pinkerton, chief technology officer — adding that he’s honored to join such “world-class leaders.” \nIn a separate Facebook post , Zuckerberg announced Plouffe and Ken Mehlman, a former Republican National Committee chairman and George W. Bush campaign manager who will lead CZI’s policy advisory board, as new hires. Plouffe said he is “eagerly anticipating collaborating with and learning from Ken Mehlman, someone I have deep respect and admiration for.” \n“The Policy Advisory Board he will build and chair will bring additional important voices and perspectives to our work,” he continued. “Getting up every day and going to work simply trying to make the world a better place for more people will be a privilege.” \nPlouffe’s latest move comes hours before Obama delivers his farewell address in Chicago, marking the end of his administration, which officially ends once President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20. \n“Excited for a new journey on the night another one ends,” Plouffe tweeted . \nCorrection: Due to an editing error, an version of this story misstated Plouffe's role.
