The black and brown bodies who typically wear hooped earrings, (and other accessories like winged eyeliner, gold name plate necklaces, etc) are typically viewed as ghetto, and are not taken seriously by others in their daily lives. Because of this, I see our winged eyeliner, lined lips, and big hoop earrings serving as symbols (and) as an everyday act of resistance, especially here at the Claremont Colleges.” Advertisement - story continues below \nThe college student then continued to state that her white fellow students wear the jewelry in an inappropriate, casual way. \n“Meanwhile we wonder, why should white girls be able to take part in this culture (wearing hoop earrings just being one case of it) and be seen as cute/aesthetic/ethnic. White people have actually exploited the culture and made it into fashion,” she concluded. \nPerhaps the most shocking part is the college supports this kind of divisiveness on their campus. According to the Pitzer website, the college even advertises its wall of “artistic representations of local and global issues that usually spark educational discussion across campus!” \nDescribing the Pfizer controversy in a National Review Online column , writer and Fox News personality Katherine Timpf summed the inanity up succinctly. No one culture in America holds ownership over any element it produces — because one reason the country succeeds is that the best of all cultures are available for adaptation.
