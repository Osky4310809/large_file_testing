I say that because there were a lot of people actively looking for her. Instead of looking for her, we need to pray for her. Pray that God softens her heart,” he wrote. In an interview with the news site, the woman apologized to the Filipino-American community. She elucidated that she and Manawat never spoke for years because of her frustrations, but she never intended to disgrace Filipino-Americans as a whole. “I stooped to the lowest possible denominator to hurt someone because I was angry,” she said. Both said that they were willing to reconcile their differences and forgive each other.
