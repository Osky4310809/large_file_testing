Tragically, the husband and wife duo BOTH missed the mark in their separate (but equally bad) ensembles. Sorry, you two!\nWe wanted to like Miz Biel's KaufmanFranco dress, but the neckpiece on the already extravagant gown was just too much. We're just not about it.\nAs for the Can't Stop The Feeling singer, we just can't get over how bad his haircut looks. Like Timberlake is giving us some serious military vibes here. At least Justin played it safe in a Tom Ford tuxedo.\nThankfully, the twosome are incredibly gorgeous so we'll forgive them for this fashion blunder.\n[ Image via Getty Images .]\nTags: fashion smashion , jessica biel , justin timberlake , kaufmanfranco , oscars , photos! , red carpet , tom ford", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:59:28.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
