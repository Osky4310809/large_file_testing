Daily Edition President Trump Talks \"Demeaning and Dishonest\" Media, Calls Madonna \"Disgusting\" in Fox News Interview 7:55 PM PST 1/26/2017 by THR Staff COMMENTS Screengrab/Fox News Speaking to Sean Hannity, Trump also reiterated how misrepresented his inauguration day crowds were and addressed the 'SNL' writer who was suspended over an inappropriate tweet about his son. \nPresident Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday, continued to reiterate how big the crowds were on his inauguration day and shared his experience with what he considers a \"very dishonest\" media so far during his administration. \n“They’re very hostile,\" Trump told Hannity about the media that has covered his decisions so far as commander-in-chief. \"These are very hostile people. They’re very dishonest, these are very dishonest people.” \nReferencing the story that Trump removed the Martin Luther King bust from the oval office, Trump assured Hannity it was not true. \"That’s a very serious charge,” he said of the false story. “That’s a racist charge.\" \nHe went on to assure Hannity, as he said the night before during his interview with ABC's David Muir, that the crowds on the National Mall during his inauguration were misrepresented by the media, calling it \"fake news.\" \n“It’s fake news. It’s fake. They make things up,\" said Trump. “They try to demean it so much. When I was in that speech it was a sea of people and they want to demean it. They are so demeaning and so dishonest and in many cases not very smart.” \nOn speech to CIA, Trump told Hannity, as he did the night before on ABC, that his speech was well received: “I gave a speech that really was a 10, relatively speaking. It was such a success. It was one standing ovation,\" Trump said. \"There were like 300-350 people in the room and if I took a vote right now I would have won 350-nothing, believe me.” \nThough Trump believed that CNN and other networks covered the event inaccurately, \"Fox treated it great,\" he told the anchor. \nHe also responded to the women's marches held on Saturday, specifically addressing Madonna's remarks , in which she said \"I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.\" \n“Honestly, she’s disgusting,\" Trump said of the performer. \"I think she hurt that whole cause. I think what she said was disgraceful to our country.” \nTrump addressed, while walking Hannity to the Oval Office, the recent controversy sparked by Saturday Night Live writer Katie Rich's tweet likening his 10-year-old son Barron Trump to a \"homeschool shooter.\" \n\"It's a failing show, and Alec Baldwin's a disaster,\" Trump said. \"But for NBC to attack my 10-year-old son is a disgrace.\" \nEarlier in the interview, Hannity asked if the president plans on keeping every one of his campaign promises. \"I’m going to keep as many as I can,\" Trump told him. “I’ve kept a lot of them already, everybody’s talking about it. That’s how I won the election in the first place, Sean – you know that better than anybody.\" \nOn torture, Trump explained that waterboarding was not always considered torture, and he believes in using it in interrogation. \"They said it really wasn't torture,\" Trump explained, which is why it was used at one point, though \"I'm sure it's not pleasant.\" He told Hannity that he spoke with \"people who are in this world\" who told him that waterboarding \"absolutely\" works. Trump told ABC's Muir a similar outlook the night before during his White House interview. \nHannity, giving an example, said, \"if I had an opportunity to speak with David Muir, I’d say, ‘OK, two guys go into your house, kidnap your child, one guy gets away. You tackle the other. That guy knows where your child is. … You don’t waterboard that guy?'\" He added that in his opinion, \"we know it works,\" to which Trump agreed. \nThe president also spoke about the proposed wall on the border between Mexico and the United States. “The wall is necessary. A wall protects, all you have to do is ask Israel. It’s 99.9% stoppage. Not like a wall that we have now, they have little toy walls.” \nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with ABC's David Muir , speaking at the White House about his plans for the border wall, torture and how media outlets covered his inauguration day \"unfairly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T07:38:02.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
