Jamie Lovett \nMarvel’s Agents of SHIELD concluded the “LMD” story with one of its best episodes yet, but the episode wasn’t without a casualty. \nSpoilers for the Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD episode “Self Control” follow. \nDr. Holden Radcliffe has been the catalyst for practically everything that has occurred in the Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD : LMD storyline. With the help of Fitz, Radcliffe created Aida, the first LMD. He created the other LMDs to obtain the Darkhold, and he used the Darkhold to create the Framework. \nKarma caught up to Radcliffe in “Self Control.” Radcliffe gave Aida two primary commands: protect Radcliffe and protect the Framework. Aida came to an impasse when she realized that Radcliffe is the greatest threat to the Framework, foreseeing that her creator would one day come to regret building the Framework and have Aida shut it down. \nRadcliffe tried to explain to Aida that she had nothing to fear. Radcliffe told her he would never shut down the Framework but it is the culmination of his life’s work, and that it allowed him to finally defeat death by taking physical bodies out of the equation. \nIn this philosophy, Aida found the answer to her conundrum. She could save the Framework from Radcliffe and keep Radcliffe “alive.” To do so she slit both of Radcliffe’s wrists and shoved his body into the Framework. By dong this, Aida has removed the physical threat of Radcliffe but kept him alive in the virtual world they built together, forcing Radcliffe to live his beliefs in a more extreme way than he was likely ready for. \nMore Marvel's Agents of SHIELD news: Showrunner Teases Graviton's Return / What Will The Final Pod Be About? / No New Episodes Until April \nOf course, that doesn’t mean we’ve seen the last of Radcliffe. All of the major SHIELD agents ended the episode plugged into the Framework, either by Aida’s own hand on by hacking into their digital avatars. With Radcliffe’s personality now uploaded into the Framework, he may still have a vital role to play in freeing the agents of SHIELD from their digital prison. Whether or not he’s willing to do so is another story. \nMarvel’s Agents of SHIELD will return to begin the third storyline of its fourth season in April on ABC.
