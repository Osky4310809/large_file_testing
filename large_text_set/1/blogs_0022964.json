He never got demoralised. And the next year he stepped up and got the podium he deserved. \n\"I have only been here a brief time, but Gabigol has already grown a lot and he has to continue on the same path. \n\"He should not be depressed if he does not get picked, nor should he get overexcited when I do play him.\" \nThe 20-year-old has made just three appearances in the league this season, all from the bench.
