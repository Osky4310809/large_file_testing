Tweets that Future sent out referencing issues the two were having because of custody disagreements over their two-year-old son including a post that read, “this bitch got control problems,” is what spurred the R&B singer to file the $15 million defamation case in the first place. \nShe alleged that his outburst caused her to lose out on a $500,000 endorsement deal and that he never paid child support. \nThe judge in the case tossed her libel claims , determining that the Atlanta rapper’s impassioned tweets weren’t enough for the suit and said she hasn’t taken a loss because she has made more money since Future went on his tirade. \nThe case has been dismissed with prejudice, meaning she can’t refile the suit if she changes her mind. \nNo worries for Ciara, as she and her husband Russell Wilson are expecting their first child together in the spring.
