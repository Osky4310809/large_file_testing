Now a couple of new reports have revealed more details regarding the iPhone 8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests that the upcoming iPhone will sport a 5.8-inch display with 5.15-inches of usable screen. \nKuo believes that the remaining space will be reserved for a ‘function area’. The display is said to take up the entire front panel of the new iPhone, effectively eliminating bezels. It appears that Apple will remove both the iconic home button and Touch ID fingerprint sensor technology used in the current iPhones. \nKuo further suggests that the OLED iPhone 8 will have measurements similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone, allowing for easy one-handed operation. Alongside the new refreshed iPhone 8, the brand will also offer standard 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD iPhones, but it’s not clear which features those devices will adopt. He believes that Apple will ship 100 million iPhones during the second half of 2017, with 60 percent accounting for the new OLED iPhone 8 model. \nIn related news, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall suggests that the iPhone 8 will sport a front-facing 3D laser scanner for facial recognition. The 3D scanner will replace Touch ID, as Apple plans to remove the home button to allow for an edge-to-edge display. He also believes that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus could incorporate a 3D laser scanner as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:16:55.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
