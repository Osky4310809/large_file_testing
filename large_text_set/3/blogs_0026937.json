Are we running out of time or failing to make the most of it?\n“Do you feel time is flying?” I am used to hearing this from peers. But when my son asked me this question, it stopped me in my tracks. I do feel time is flying. But that’s because as we get older, our time is shrinking, even as we keep adding stuff to our To-Do List. However it beats me why a youngster should be feeling the same!\n“It’s because of all this,” Nikhil said waving an arm that took in the TV playing Netflix, the cellphone and laptop. “They just soak up all our free time.” True. Think back to a time when we had no access to home entertainment generated by technology. We talked and laughed, read, sat in the lawn and interacted with neighbours and friends. We went for picnics and visited each other’s homes while the evenings stretched before us. Where is all that free time now?\nAnd it’s not just the time we spend on gadgets; also to be blamed is the hidden impact of technology. It has given us exposure and made us more competitive and so, more stressed. As young Saurabh says, “I remember back when I was younger, I would look forward to Friday all week, but now I’m just scared by Friday that the weekend is already starting to end!” Why? He says that while weekends earlier were just fun time, today they are the time to recover from the weeklong stress.\nThere is so much to do today that time seems limited in comparison. No wonder it feels like life has suddenly picked pace and is hurtling ahead uncontrollably. The same distances seem longer or shorter, the same incidents seem to happen faster or slower depending on our state of mind, mood and level of engagement. When bored, time seems to drag, while when you multitask, you just can’t seem to keep pace with time! A pot that you watch takes ages to boil, while if you get busy with something else, it seems to boil over the moment you turn your back! The same distance that takes ages to cover, flies by in a jiffy if in good company or happily engaged otherwise.\nSimilarly, our emotional states also have an impact on how we relate to time. In a happy state of mind, you just cannot seem to hold back time; while when sad or grieving, it seems interminable. With someone you love, time skids on skates; with someone you don’t care about, it drags relentlessly.\nAs we grow older, we are more in control of our lives and clearer on what we want and how to get it. Life becomes more enjoyable as we get into the groove and start living it well. No wonder it seems to go by faster. As we grow older still, how time treats us depends on how we treat time and ourselves. If we plan our old age and engage in pleasurable activity, time treats us better and passes by pleasantly. If we enter dotage without plan, time hangs heavy on our heads. And if we do not learn to keep a sense of balance, we will never have enough time for all that really needs to be done.\nTime, at any age or stage of life can fly past recklessly. And yet sometimes, time seems to drag its feet too. At times, the years rush by, while days seem to be crawling interminably. Turn it around and I think that might be ideal – a time when days rush by and the year seems like a long, long time!\nPlanning and balance is the key to having a healthy, respectable relationship with time. The trick is in riding time and life rather than flowing with it; the reigns can be tightened or left idle off and on.\nA Quote: by novelist Susan Ertz sums up time and our insidious relationship with it, “Millions long for immortality who don’t know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon!”\n( Next Sunday : How to make the most of time )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T07:29:46.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
