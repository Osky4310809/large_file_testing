House of Representatives \nOthers invited include Department of State Services, DSS; Central Bank of Nigeria,CBN, and all other stakeholders connected to the development. \nThey are to appear before the committee today. \nRecall that the legal firm, Edwards and Partners, had petitioned the House of Representatives, threatening to freeze accounts of the Federal Government in the US and United Kingdom, if the legal fee was not paid for services that facilitated the payment of the $3.189 billion. \nVanguard further gathered that the crux of the matter took another dimension when the Minister of Finance in a letter dated November 21, 2016, directed the CBN governor to pay the Nigerian Governors Forum the sum of $86,546,526.65 relating to consultants fees. \nVanguard findings, however, revealed that this did not go down well with Edwards and Partners who had earlier gone to court vide a judgment with ref: FHC/ABJ/CS//130/13 where it was ordered that they be paid their legal fees. \nThe minister also directed within this period that the Governors Forum be paid in its first tranche the sum of N153,015,930,045.35 out of the recovered over deductions facilitated by the lawyers. \nThe lawyers had insisted in the petition addressed to the speaker, Yakubu Dogara, that they needed be paid first on first line basis, based on the judgment not any other entity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T13:51:31.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
