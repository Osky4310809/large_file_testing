LEAD by Alejandro Guijarro is at Tristan Hoare gallery , London, from 10 March - 28 April 2017 Photograph: Courtesy Tristan Hoare 19207 (Boissy d’Anglas at the National Convention [20 May 1795]), 2016 ‘For LEAD, I worked in collaboration with the conservation and collections departments of the Prado Museum, Madrid, the Louvre, Paris and the National Gallery, London,’ he says. ‘These images are reproductions of x-ray and ultraviolet photographs of celebrated old master paintings – including works by Van Dyck, Rubens, Delacroix, Goya, Da Vinci and Velazquez, among others’ P01692a00xf2006 (Adam and Eve), 2016 ‘The title of the series, LEAD, refers to the presence of the metal in 17th and 18th century paint. Light bouncing back off the lead pigments in the paintings is partly what you can see in these x-rays; its presence transforms recognisable images into otherworldly scenes, and in doing so the viewer is given access to a separate reality below the surface of the paint’ 20769 (Descent from the Cross), 2016 ‘I employ these scientific processes – used traditionally to demystify paintings – to make them more unknowable, blurring the division between science and art’ 21600 (St Gregory the Great), 2016 ‘At the heart of this series is a paradox: as x-rays they belong to the realm of scientific images, objective, possessing an unquestionable scientific truth. Yet, by their visual indeterminacy, they also exist in the subjective world of personal interpretation, the intuitional and emotional’ 73813 (Siege of Beauvais in 1472), 2016 ‘A museum’s conservation department has the ability to reveal a truth about these paintings with an absolute certainty. The viewer does not and cannot – they do not know what they see. I invite the viewer to displace their preconceptions of these celebrated old master paintings, and supplant them with their own’ RX15260 (The Bestowal of the Order of Saint-Spirit, in the Chapel of Versailles Palace [3 June 1724]), 2016 ‘The titles of these works refer both to the original painting but also, by including their archival codes, they refer to their “document” status. As “records” they imply an evidential proof – one that often directly contradicts their immediate, outward, abstract appearance’ RX15088 (Mona Lisa), 2016 ‘These images emerge from a certain degree of chance. They derive from a mechanical technique which lacks a conscious design. The nature of the final image is impossible to predict, and is utterly unexpected’ 57954 (Saint Pierre Released From Prison), 2016 ‘Developing on from my Momentum series, where I visited the world’s leading quantum physics institutions and photographed their blackboards, I have continued to investigate the relationship between art and science, and the paradoxes and contradictions that emerge where the boundaries of the photographic image break down’ P01180a00xf2011 (Prince Baltasar Carlos on Horseback), 2016 ‘By undermining our recognisable modes of perception, my photographic practice aims to question the solidity and authority of the photographic image and its ability to refer to reality and truth’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:36:14.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
