It's even thought the color stimulates hunger, which may be why a number of other fast food brands use the color. \nRed is also often used to signal a sale, so many brands will use it in combination with a softer color like white or yellow to convey the properties of red without risking the perception the brand may be going out of business. Subway Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nWith the use of green, which is often used to signal health and restoration, Subway looks to convey the values of freshness which it has put at the core of its brand. \nYellow is also another color that can easily be spotted from far away and draw consumers to its restaurants. Baskin Robbins Flickr/bargainmoose \nBlue and pink are often combined to promote sugary products since pink signals sweetness and playfulness. \nCarol Austin, VP of marketing for the brand told CNBC the logo is \"meant to convey the fun and energy of the Baskin-Robbins brand.\" \nThe logo also has a hidden message: The pink 31 in the logo stands for each day in the month that consumers can discover a new flavor. United Airlines \nBlue is used to signal trustworthiness, often demanded by consumers from airlines. \nIt's also associated with reliability and loyalty, which is why law enforcement uniforms are blue.

Lufthansa Thomson Reuters \nLike many other airlines, Lufthansa uses blue but it's one of the few to add yellow, which stands for happiness and optimism. \nThe visual identity was introduced by the German graphic designer Olt Aicher and was considered one of the most successful rebrands of the 20th century. But Aicher himself never considered the design as mature, according to Disegno . Nokia Thomson Reuters \nThe color blue is often used by telecoms companies because it conveys clarity and security. \nThe current Nokia logo has been in place ever since it moved to telecommunications equipment â€” before that it was a paper mill company .

The black in the logo signals strength and security, both essential to any smartphone manufacturer. Chanel AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko \nChanel was the pioneer of the famous \"little black dress\" so it's only natural for the color black to be a core part of the brand's identity. \nBlack is considered to be a very fashionable color and stands for the sophistication in the retail world. Vans Vans \nThe use of black to signal elegance and red for passion falls in line with Vans' values of enabling people to do what they love. \nThe brand has recently started to look to appeal to audiences outside of skateboarding and its latest campaign is all about people following their creative passions . Hermes Philippe Wojazer/Reuters \nOrange is thought to exude extroversion and confidence, which Hermes has every right to as the world's second most valuable luxury brand . \nThe brand reportedly chose the color orange out of necessity: It was the color of the only paperboard available to the company during the Second World War. Toyota Matt Cardy/Getty Images \nThe different shades of silver often used in the automobile industry stand for quality and workmanship. \nThe Toyota logo took three years to design and is meant to be recognized head-on and in a rear view mirror. The two inner circles represent the relationship between the customer and the brand living together in the world, which is depicted by the bigger circle around them. Audi AP Photo/Matthias Schrader \nThe red Audi script in the logo is meant to stand for masculinity of the brand and a love for driving. \nWhile much can be read into the four rings logo, the reasoning behind it is practical: Audi was one of four car companies that merged in 1932 . The logo of the new company became all four logos in circles linked together. The individual brands' logos were eventually dropped, leaving only the four rings. Volkswagen AP Photo/Michael Sohn \nWith the blue in its logo, Volkswagen wants to convey the values that German cars have become known for: Reliability and consistency. \nIt also fits with the name of the brand, which translates to \"car for the people.\" The Range The Range \nThe British improvement store chain decided to go with blue in its logo to help customers relax before taking on a big DIY project. The Home Depot \nOrange is considered a youthful color, which evokes a feeling of excitement and fun. \nThe brightness of the color makes it easy to spot a Home Depot from far away.

Pfizer AP Photo/Mark Lennihan \nMedical companies will often turn to blue because it stands for cleanliness and health. \nThe oval shape of Pfizer's logo, which was created in 1987, is meant to be similar to that of a medical pill. GlaxoSmithKline Thomson Reuters \nGSK is a recently created company, formed out of a merger of two British pharmaceutical companies. \nThis edition of the logo was created in 2014, but the color orange has always been a part of the company's branding.

Merck Kris Tripplaar/SIPA USA/PA Images \nThe American pharma company, one of the largest in the world, has gone through multiple editions of its branding. The green logo is associated with feelings of health and healing. USPS Kevork Djansezian/USPS \nBlue is considered a color that promotes feelings of trustworthiness and security. \nThe eagle in the USPS logo was always a part of the brand, but it's only since 1993 that the current \"sonic eagle\" has been on mail delivery trucks. Royal Mail Joe Giddens/PA Images \nWhen it comes to brand recognition through color it's hard to pass on the UK's postal service, Royal Mail. \nIt has strict guidelines when it comes to branding: Each iconic mailbox has to be painted in the standard red and black. The color is associated with dedication and persistence. The mailboxes were originally green, and changed to red in 1874 to make them more visible . TNT Delivery Ben A. Pruchnie/Getty Images \nThe Dutch parcel delivery company is one of the biggest in the world, with a presence in 61 countries and over $7 billion in sales in 2015. \nThe firm was acquired by FedEx in 2016.
