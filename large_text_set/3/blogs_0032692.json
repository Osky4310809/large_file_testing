Hennigan (D-Mass.) told Votel she was concerned that additional deployments may lead to an “expansive, open-ended commitment” in Syria.\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Thursday that a new use of force authorization could be up for debate once the White House settles on its strategy for combating Islamic State. \n“They’re developing an ISIS strategy. They sent one to the president a month ago; he hasn’t accepted it. When they finish that, we plan to have hearings on all of these issues,” Corker said. “My guess is after that, we may in fact try and do an AUMF,” he said, referring to an authorization for use of military force. \nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, said the appetite in Congress has grown for taking a fresh look at the issue. \n“The world’s changed a bit,” Tillis said. “The nature of the threat’s changed too.” \nThat would be an important step, said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.). \n“I do not think it is right for the U.S. military to become involved in the Syrian civil war based on the 9/11 AUMF,” he said. “I voted for that AUMF as a House member. I never imagined that vote being used to justify U.S. ground troops in Syria in the year 2017. And I don’t think anyone else who voted in favor of it did either.” \nTimes staff writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this article.
