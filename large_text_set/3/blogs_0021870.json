When independent fact-checkers dispute this content, you may be able to visit their websites to find out why,” it reads. “Only fact-checkers signed up to Poynter’s non-partisan code of principles are shown.”\nIt also links to Facebook's official help page and to the debunking articles from AP and Snopes.com .\nIf you ignore the warning, another pop-up asserts that the article's accuracy is \"disputed by multiple, independent fact-checkers\".\nIf you proceed to publish the article a red box still shows up in the timeline:\nThe feature was announced in December 2016 but this appears to be the first time people have noticed it on a story that went viral.\nMashable attempted to post the story using a device in London, but the red alert did not show up.\nFacebook's help centre page entitled 'How is news marked as disputed on Facebook' confirms that the feature isn't available to everyone yet.\nSome Trump supporters have been critical of the tool, questioning its veracity.\nPaul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of Infowars, criticised the inclusion of Snopes in Facebook's list of independent fact-checkers.\nThis is now appearing on Facebook posts. Snopes is a bias, far-left outfit. It is not a responsible \"fact-checker\". pic.twitter.com/IMB0RVJklz\n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) March 18, 2017\nLiam Hogan, a librarian and historian based in Ireland, said Trump supporters were \"losing their minds\" about the red alert:\nTrump supporters & others are losing their minds that Facebook is now showing this warning when they share a certain \"Irish slaves\" article pic.twitter.com/fzeU8ZOzjb\n— Liam Hogan (@Limerick1914) March 19, 2017\nOther Trump fans or right-wing bloggers took to Twitter to assert that the Irish slave trade was real and Facebook was committing \"Pre-Thoughtcrime\":\nDangerous precedent, no one would deny an Irish slave trade, they might object to elevated numbers.
