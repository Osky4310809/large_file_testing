Rowling isn't just a famous author or human rights advocate. She's also a dog mom.\nSEE ALSO: J.K. Rowling's Twitter feud with Piers Morgan just took an unexpected twist\nYesterday, in between tweeting gems of wisdom and battling writer's block, Rowling shared a proud dog mom moment with her Twitter followers.\nI've spent all day wrestling with the same damn paragraph, but this afternoon my dog was rated on @dog_rates and that's everything üê∂‚≠êÔ∏è https://t.co/OO0KeAtSGz\n‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 20, 2017\nRowling was responding to a WeRateDogs tweet that rated her adorable West Highland terrier, Bront√´. The pup scored an impressive 13/10.\nThis is Bronte. She's fairly h*ckin aerodynamic. Also patiently waiting for mom to make her a main character. 13/10 would be an honor to pet pic.twitter.com/w1MQWO2PET\n‚Äî WeRateDogs‚Ñ¢ (@dog_rates) February 20, 2017\nWhen a fan asked the author about Bront√´'s name, Rowling responded with the enthusiasm of a mother talking about her child.\n@dog_rates which Bront√´ is she named for, @jk_rowling ?\n‚Äî Michael Henning (@killminusnine) February 20, 2017\nShe responded:\nIn my mind, Anne (controversial, I know), but one of my kids was only recociled to the name on the basis that it was short for Brontosaurus. https://t.co/AScKk0ahBt\n‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 20, 2017\nShe's hardly ever called 'Bront√´', though. The very opposite of She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, she's got about a hundred nicknames.\n‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 20, 2017\nWhether named after a long-necked dinosaur or an English novelist, the story behind Bront√´'s name is sweet.\nRowling has tweeted pictures pictures of her and Bront√´, often while she's writing.\nWhen your dog decides you've written enough for one day. pic.twitter.com/aDE9Av0z4E\n‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 29, 2016\nIt's great to know that Rowling has such a faithful writing partner to keep her on track and motivated.\nA little end of chapter congratulation. pic.twitter.com/A9K8a5x7Dx\n‚Äî J.K.
