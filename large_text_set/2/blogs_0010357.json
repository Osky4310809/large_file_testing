(Though Greenpeace claims the latter actually grew in capacity last year.)\nBut the enduring smog is good news for section of society: peddlers of anti-pollution products. The range of prophylactics has grown enormously over the last few years, and ranges from the sensible — such as ever more sophisticated face masks and air purifiers — to the highly dubious, such as anti-smog herbal teas.\nBoasting ingredients such as “polygonatum, cumquat, lily, red dates, chrysanthemum and rock candy,” the latter are claimed by manufacturers to “alleviate the harm to the human body of long-term inhalation of air pollution.” Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners are unimpressed, though; Liu Quanqing, president of the Beijing Hospital of TCM, told China’s state media last month that such concoctions were “unreliable” and “may cause health problems if taken for a long time.”\nVCG via Getty Images Passengers walk in the smog at Zhengzhou East Railway Station on January 9, 2017 in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China. But it’s not just teas that have dubious efficacy. China’s online trading platform Taobao — the nation’s gargantuan equivalent of Ebay and Amazon — is chock-full with bizarre anti-smog products. There are anti-smog windows and anti-smog trees . For $5,000 you can buy a truck-mounted anti-smog water cannon that drenches particles from the air. Conversely, there is also anti-smog incense , for those who literally want to fight fumes with fumes.\nFor skeptics, face masks and air purifiers remain the preferred choices, and China has made major strides with both.\nThere are masks with built-in fans , masks just for the nose , and even couples’ masks especially for Valentines Day . For fashionistas, Beijing designer Wang Zhijun turns high-end sneakers into face masks; one was crafted from a pair of Kanye West-designed, limited edition Adidas Yeezy Boosts that were recently sold online for $10,000.\nAir purifiers, meanwhile, are becoming cheaper and more efficient. Chinese tech firm Xiaomi leads the way with its Mi Air Purifier Pro, boasting a dual-fan, dual-motor system with “high-precision laser sensor.”\n“Air purifiers are made not just for smog,” company spokesman Zhuoqi Li tells TIME. “In fact, air purifiers also sell well in countries with generally good air quality as they can filter pollen, dust, airborne germs and eliminate odors.”\nXiaomi should know what it’s talking about. Late last month, global vice-president Hugo Barra quit the Beijing-based firm to move back to California, saying ”that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health.”\n—With reporting by Yang Siqi / Sanya ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:39:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
