ADVERTISEMENT \nBesides China and the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims in the South China Sea. \nThe Philippines tried to have the arbitration ruling mentioned in a joint statement at last year’s Asean summit, but China allies Cambodia and Laos blocked the move, handing a diplomatic victory to Beijing. \nMilitarization \nAsked whether the Philippines would ask China to stop building airstrips and docks on disputed reefs while the code of conduct is the works, Manalo said this was “the challenge we face in coming out with the framework.” \nBut the Philippines and other Asean members would continue to push for the peaceful resolution of the disputes, he added. \nThe Philippines’ playing host to the Asean summit comes amid warming ties between Manila and Beijing, with President Duterte reaching out to the Asian economic powerhouse for a mending of fences after the arbitration in The Hague. \nMr. Duterte has deferred bringing up the arbitration court ruling with China, though he has said he will insist on it during his term. \nThe government will formally launch the Philippine chairmanship of the 2017 Asean summit in Davao City on Jan. 15. This year also marks Asean’s 50th anniversary. \nHosting the event will cost the Philippines P15.5 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:23:22.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
