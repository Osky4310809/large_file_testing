After playing the fiddle in Jack White’s touring band, she became a new addition to White’s Third Man Records roster in 2014. Today, Lillie Mae is premiering a single off of her Third Man debut Forever And Then Some . \n“Honky Tonks And Taverns” expands on the country prowess she demonstrated on her TMR 7″“Nobody’s” b/w “The Same Eyes,” delivering an expertly polished, delightfully upbeat track that takes those former principles and runs with them. The song features layers of bopping strings and begins with a brief, candid moment of chatter caught during recording that highlights her close knit friendship with White and the rest of the Third Man crew. It also demonstrates her level of comfort recording among family, as her sisters and brothers lend a hand and play instruments on this release. She shared some background on the release: \n“Honky Tonks and Taverns” is about the way I once was, the dreams I had, the mistakes I made, and the people I’ve known that disappeared. Although they didn’t just vanish, they all still live on in memory… in the valleys and caverns, honky tonks and taverns. \nListen below. \nForever And Then Some is out 4/17 via Third Man Records and you can pre-order it here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:54:17.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
