There are quite a few of them available including Google’s Assistant , Amazon’s Alexa as well as Microsoft’s Cortana. As Windows smartphones aren’t really in high demand, Microsoft brought its digital assistant to Android at the end of 2015 in hopes of expanding its user base.\nAccording to a report from MSPoweruser , Microsoft is now trying to make it a lot easier for Android users to access Cortana on their devices. The digital assistant, which received a fresh new look about a month ago, will apparently soon be accessible from your smartphone’s lock screen. By swiping either left or right, you’ll be able to launch Cortana and ask her to help you out with various tasks.\nSee also: Google Assistant update adds ability to take screenshots 1 week ago Microsoft’s digital assistant is capable of opening apps, setting alarms, browsing the web, making calls, sending emails, and more based on your voice commands.\nMicrosoft is currently testing to see how well the new feature works with the help of users who have signed up for the Cortana beta testing program. Therefore, it is expected that the digital assistant might come to your lock screen soon, although no specific dates have been mentioned so far.\nIf you like Microsoft’s Cortana and would like to try out the new feature before the majority of users, you’ll be happy to hear that you can still sign up for the testing program.
