There’s something stunning about seeing the usually chiseled tomboy softer and more feminine in her maternal glow, and looking at the photo spread in Harper’s Bazaar with the first love of her life, Baby Future, is enough to make almost any woman’s ovaries tingle just a smidge. Or maybe entice you to take a walk down the aisle as you hear the singer gush over husband Russell Wilson with the maturity of a woman who’s learned a thing or two from her past (highly public) relationships.\nHer relationship with Russell, Ciara told the mag, is “even greater… just… so… amazing… awesome…It really is.” And that has to do a lot with the fact that Russell, 28, whom she tied the knot with last July, always has her back.\n“If someone’s not supporting you and your vision and your dreams —whether it’s your relationship partner, your friend, whomever, then you’ve got to make sure to keep it moving. If people aren’t lifting you up, even if you’re the strongest person in the world, eventually it does chip away at you. You don’t even realize that you’re losing yourself. And that’s the scariest place to be in life… I don’t want to lose myself. I love myself too much. I love life too much.”\nAnd why wouldn’t she? As a newlywed and an expectant mother, 31-year-old Ciara seems to have everything she always wanted. The fact that we’re still talking about her 13 years after the release of  Goodies is a testament to her ability to achieve anything she puts her mind too. At 14, she made a list of three goals: to get discovered, sign a record deal and “have longevity.” Check, check, and check. In fact, there’s another delivery on the way many may not know about. According to CiCi, new music is on the way. “I got this baby and my album,” she shared.\n“I’m just super excited about this time in my life,” she said. “Like, Oh my gosh, I can see my son running around, and soon it’s going to be two of these creatures running around! Our hands will be full of non-stop action.”\nWe can’t wait to see the two — or four — in action either. Check out all the photos from her spread on the next few pages.\n\nThe post Ciara And Baby Future Have The Cutest Photoshoot As She Gushes Over “Just… So… Amazing… Awesome…” Marriage appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:24:04.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
