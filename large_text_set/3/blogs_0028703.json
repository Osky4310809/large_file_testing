Nonsense. Everyone knows the only thing that can shut down London is a light dusting of snow. https://t.co/vG3rJeh4EP\n— Ben Rathe (@benrathe) ID: 10755560 In fact, people were convinced that even pubs near the scene probably kept their doors open to show that Londoners were not afraid.

The \"London is shut down, city in fear\" narrative is immensely insulting to Londoners, who have seen a lot worse. London is very safe now\n— Tom Chivers (@TomChivers) ID: 10755644 It was business as usual in London – and it was clear that “one man” could definitely not shut down this city. Yeah, London was really \"shut down\" today.
