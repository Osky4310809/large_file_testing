Freese will back up Kang and provide additional depth at first. \nUtility: Adam Frazier , Alen Hanson Frazier seems to be guaranteed a job after his breakout rookie season. Hanson is not, but he's out of Minor League options. He just has to be good enough offensively to support his athletic defense and speed on the bases. Recently acquired infielder Phil Gosselin , a right-handed complement to the lefty-swinging Frazier, might be Hanson's toughest competition. \nA new look, left to right, but no position battles here. Healthy Taillon key to Pirates Young Bucs righty Taillon could be difference maker MLB.com Pirates reporter Adam Berry discusses how Jameson Taillon will be a difference maker to the club's rotation in 2017 \nRotation: Gerrit Cole , Jameson Taillon , Ivan Nova , Kuhl, Drew Hutchison Cole, Taillon and Nova are locks. Kuhl is not set in stone, but it's probably fair to pencil him in. The last spot is up for grabs, with Hutchison, Tyler Glasnow , Steven Brault and Trevor Williams the most likely candidates. We'll give the edge to Hutchison based on his experience. Glasnow certainly has the highest ceiling but still could start the season in Triple-A. \nBullpen: Tony Watson , Daniel Hudson , Felipe Rivero , Juan Nicasio , Antonio Bastardo , Jared Hughes , Wade LeBlanc Watson, Hudson and Rivero are the back-end trio. Nicasio and Bastardo (if he's not traded) could work just about anywhere. Hughes should be the fireman, called upon for ground-ball outs and multi-inning stints. But with an option remaining, Hughes must prove his rough first half last year was just a fluke. \nThere are a handful of candidates for the last spot . The early favorites are LeBlanc (who signed a non-guaranteed contract), Rule 5 Draft pick Tyler Webb (who could be sent back to the Yankees or retained in Triple-A through a trade) and right-hander A.J. Schugel (who could be optioned to Triple-A). \nFor now, LeBlanc gets the nod over Webb based on his September success in Pittsburgh. Theoretically, both could crack the roster if Bastardo is traded before Opening Day. has covered the Pirates for MLB.com since 2015.
