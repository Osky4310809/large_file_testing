Some have also called into question the order’s legality , noting the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , which states that the U.S. cannot bar immigrants from entering the country based on religion or national origin.\nFederal Judge Bars Deportations Under President Trump’s Immigration Order Pat Tillman was killed in the mountains of Afghanistan during a gun battle by what the military later determined to be friendly fire . In the wake of his death, Tillman’s family and friends founded The Pat Tillman Foundation , which “invests in military veterans and their spouses through academic scholarships.”\nNow, Tillman is determined to work with the foundation’s leaders – “Tillman Scholars” – to push back against the controversial order.\n“They are exactly as I knew they would be, poised and ready to fight,” Tillman continued in the post. “I am proud of them and proud to stand with them, we’ve got this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T15:50:57.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
