This year’s event has been dogged by delays, walk-outs and general Euro-grumbling , so some uplifting news coming out of Eurovision HQ would be most welcome. \nAnd if the Eurovision powers-that-be wanted to spread some joy, they could do a lot worse than dispensing with the daft rule about only six people being allowed on the stage at any one time; a petty regulation that has consistently denied Blazin’ Squad the opportunity to represent the United Kingdom. If these turbulent times have shown us anything, it’s that good things happen when lots of people unite for a common cause. Nothing would capture the spirit of Eurovision better than 30 Polish milkmaids/Russian grannies/Finnish rock gods, knee deep in dry ice, belting out a four-part harmony of Love Love Peace Peace. \nAnd lo, my prayers have been answered. Today the European Broadcasting Union launched the inaugural Eurovision Choir of the Year, to be hosted in the Latvian capital Riga on 22 July. Before you get excited enough to look up Latvia on a map, the UK aren’t taking part, even though we’d definitely win. But before we tackle Britain’s unsurpassed choral supremacy, what can we expect from the very first Eurovision Choir of the Year? The official blurb tells me that only seven EBU member countries are currently confirmed (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Germany and Slovenia), with each nation performing a six-minute unaccompanied set, in any genre, with no limits on the number of singers. \nSo we’re talking an unlimited number of people, singing whatever they like, for six minutes. It could be 12 Estonian pensioners singing folk songs, or 85 Austrian children yodelling Toto’s Africa – the possibilities are infinite. I once witnessed a Spanish choir singing a McFly medley, so who knows what musical delights are in store; the prospect of finding out in July makes me very happy indeed. The possibilities are infinite … the Eurovision Choir of the Year.

On this occasion we can’t win because we haven’t entered – though we were invited – which is clearly madness. Britain’s choral tradition goes back to medieval times, and you only have to look at our university colleges and cathedrals for evidence of our butt-kicking credentials. \nBut if we can’t spare any choirboys during the summer holidays, we could always send the chart-topping NHS Choir, or one of the many choirs showcased on Britain’s Got Talent, like the brilliant 100 Voices of Gospel or the sublime Welsh choir Cor Glanaethwy. In fact, forget auditions – all the UK needs is a bunch of Welsh people; we could probably round up a winning choir by holding up a sign in Magor services on the M4. \nAnd if all else fails, we have our secret weapon – Gareth Malone . Gareth can make a prize-winning choir out of just about anything – military wives, grumpy teenagers, people from Hertfordshire – so it’s hard to imagine him coming away from Eurovision with anything less than a win for the UK. Which is something we haven’t dared to dream of for the best part of two decades. \nFind us a choir for 2018, Gareth. You’re our only Eurovision hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:41:46.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
