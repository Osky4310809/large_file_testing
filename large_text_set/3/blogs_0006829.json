Grid-scale battery storage could help solve these issues and naturally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is up for the task. He said he can build a 100 megawatt (MW) battery storage system in 100 days, or he’ll give it to the region for free. \nSouth Australia has battled power problems for months; there have been blackouts in the state since last September. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull even declared a national energy emergency . But Lyndon Rive, former SolarCity CEO who now works as Tesla’s vice president for energy products, told Australia publication AFR Tesla could fix the dilemma in 100 days. Mike Cannon-Brookes, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, got hold of the article and tweeted it out, asking Musk how serious he is about the claim. Musk responded, “Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T16:55:06.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
