The textured and layered social reality of Gorakhpur and the broader region of Poorvanchal, as eastern Uttar Pradesh is known, would indicate a very different view of Adityanath there than among Delhi’s permanently aggrieved commentating classes.\nAdityanath’s appointment was not preceded by an in-house upheaval. There was a buy-in to this decision from Modi, Shah and the RSS functionaries who helped in the UP campaign. To argue ‘Modi’s hand was forced’ is nonsense and is to make a claim the PM himself is not making.\nUnlike the previous BJP government (1999-2004) or the UPA government (2004-14), there is no great divergence today between the ruling party and the PM’s political instincts — and neither has Modi pretended victimhood on this score as his two immediate predecessors frequently did.\nIt is true that the campaign was not fought with Adityanath as the chief ministerial candidate. Given caste equations and rivalries in UP — another undeniable reality that cannot be wished away — the BJP decided that identifying any one candidate would evoke a negative response from other individuals and groups. As such, it decided to seek votes in Modi’s name, with the party’s electoral mascot committing he would guide and monitor the next state government.\nGiven this promise and given the mandate, any choice for chief ministerwould have been a compromise. Short of Modi resigning from the prime ministry and becoming head of the state government, there was no BJP candidate who could truly represent the entirety of the UP verdict.\nTop of the Pop Charts The fact is the BJP has lacked an effective pan-state leader. It previously won a majority in UP in 1991, at a time when somebody like Rajnath Singh, Union home minister today, was a young politician. For 15 years, it has been out of power, and a vacuum has emerged.\nOne of the challenges of the Modi-Shah team since 2014 has been to nurture a new leadership in UP. Obviously, three years have been too short to do this, and the process must continue. But that is another story.\nAmong senior state-level politicianswho were available after the March 11 result, Adityanath was clearly the most popular. Opinion polls, insofar as they are reliable, indicated he had agreater acceptance across the state, in regions other than Poorvanchal as well, than any of his party peers.\nConversations with MLAs had many conceding that point. The BJP brains trust had, in any case, felt it was time for a chief minister from eastern Uttar Pradesh, which has not seen a strong mass leader in the top job in Lucknow since Vir Bahadur Singh of the Congress in the 1980s.\nAdityanath presented an obvious choice. To keep a popular and senior face (he is a five-time MP) out of, first, the Union Cabinet and then the state government as well, in spite of big electoral victories, was politically imprudent and potentially destabilising.\nIt would have created a rupture in the relationship between groundlevel impulses and the superstructure of government, with the latter not being sufficiently representative or mindful of the former. Adityanath’s image as a Hindu monk also helped bypass caste cleavages as he was not associated with any one caste group.\nHindu identity is a pillar of the BJP’s politics. This pillar is not enough for the party to win a majority. But it is nevertheless essential to its electoral appeal. Frankly, despite the hopes and dreams of the young voter in UP, identity politics (caste or religion) is not going to go away and will have to find a way to incorporate economic and developmental aspirations. An astute electoral campaign, party or politician has to offer both.\nIn opting for Adityanath, the BJP has both rewarded and challenged him. It has asked him to move beyond — even sublimate — his obsession with identity politics into the larger enterprise of governance. In a sense, this is what Mayawati did when she became chief minister in 2007 and made a name for herself with rigorous law enforcement.\nHindu Heart, Hindi Heartland If the BJP’s bet on Adityanath pays off, it will throw up a mass leader and experienced administrator with possible electoral impact not just in UP but across the Hindi heartland. That is the best-case scenario for the party. Grant Modi this: even at his peak, he has promoted a new leader, two decades younger than him, and gambled on the capacity of democratic governance to leaven and mainstream him.
