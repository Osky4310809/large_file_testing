In what is Canada’s longest-running military operation, every winter artillery units are dispatched into the mountains west of Banff to wage war on Mother Nature.  \n“It would be a mistake to think that Rogers Pass has been subdued … every winter, the timeless forces of snowfall and avalanche batter away at the defences,” reads the unusually poetic Parks Canada description of Operation Palaci, the annual shelling of the mountains of Glacier National Park.\nParks Canada An Operation Palaci gun crew surrounded by discarded shells in February, 2014. The operation has been carried out every year since the 1962 opening of the Trans-Canada Highway. And in principle, it’s relatively simple: Road crews close a section of highway, artillery units move in to blast away at snow pack, and then snow ploughs are dispatched to clear whatever hits the highway.  \n“You’re standing there and everybody just disappears and then everybody reappears and we dust ourselves off and fire at the next avalanche,” Sgt. Dave Jarrell, an Operation Palaci member, told Postmedia in 2015.\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXWIJ_m2XI&w=640&h=390]\nThe artillery units are deployed to what is believed to be the most avalanche-prone stretch of major road in all North America: the single 40-kilometre section of highway through Glacier National Park passes through 134 avalanche paths — an average of one every 300 metres.\nAn incredible 14 metres of snow hits Rogers Pass every year.\nIn nearby Banff and Revelstoke, it’s not uncommon that residential streets are flanked by two-metre-high snowbanks by February. To keep infrastructure from getting lost under the snow, everything from park benches to fire hydrants are fitted with bamboo poles to mark their position.\nGavin Young/Calgary Herald Members of the Canadian Forces 1st Royal Canadian Horse Artillery B Battery maneuver a Howitzer into position in this 2015 photo. The area’s avalanches have been known to wipe whole trains from sight and killed more than 200 railway workers by the early years of the 20 th century.\nThe 1910 Rogers Pass avalanche, which killed 62 workers, is still Canada’s deadliest avalanche. It’s also in the same general vicinity where Michel Trudeau, the youngest brother of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was killed by an avalanche in 1998.\nIt’s for this reason that the Trans-Canada Highway is actually Canada’s second attempt to drive transportation infrastructure through the area. The highway follows what was the original path of the Canadian Pacific Railway, until the rising cost and body count of avalanches forced railroad engineers to abandon the pass in 1916.\nHighway builders blanketed the area with avalanche-taming dikes, catch basins, earth dams and sections of highway roofed by reinforced “snow sheds.” However, given the raw tonnage of snow, Parks Canada maintains that Operation Palaci is the only thing standing in the way of regular, days-long closures of the Trans-Canada Highway.\nThe operation typically involves 17 artillery members dispatched in two rotations to the resort communities of the Rocky Mountains.\nFacebook/Canadian Armed Forces Members of the 1st Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery pictured in 2014. This year’s snow soldiers all come from the 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, based out of Shilo, Man. Equipped with C3 105-mm Howitzers, the gun crews move between one of 17 permanent highway-side gun platforms.\nA fair amount of shellfire falls on Glacier National Park as a result. In 2013, for instance, Operation Palaci fired off 411 rounds, triggering 245 avalanches. In the 1980s, rates of fire occasionally topped 800.\nFor context, if a C3 Howitzer was used in an all-out bombardment during a time of war, 411 rounds would be enough ammunition to supply a single gun for about two and a half hours of continuous firing.\nThe target list is provided by Parks Canada, which keeps tabs on the Rogers Pass snow pack through a complex network of remote sensors and ski teams.\nAnd then, as the military  describes it , “upon order, the Avalanche Control Troop engages these targets with high explosive projectiles.”\n(Parks Canada, in general, is less delicate about describing Operation Palaci. Here’s a video they compiled pairing artillery fire with rock music.) \nAround the world, mountain regions can still be a bit squeamish about the Canadian-style method of avalanche clearance. Japan, home to many of the world’s snowiest regions, has largely banned any explosives-based snow clearance.\nHowever, Howitzer fire is similarly a wintertime feature of mountain regions in the United States, particularly Colorado, Utah, Alaska and California. Although, in certain cases, artillery deployments have been replaced with specialized explosives dropped by helicopter.\nU.S. Forest Service workers were even once issued with bazooka-style recoilless rifles that could be fired from the back of pickup trucks, until poor aim accidentally destroyed a home in Ogden, Utah, in the late 1970s.\n• Email: thopper@nationalpost.com \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:45:50.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
