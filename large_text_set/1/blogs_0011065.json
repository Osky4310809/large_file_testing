Though the house was damaged by a 1963 fire, but Neutra and his son, Dion, rebuilt the house, and the elder Neutra lived there until his death in 1970.\nMichael Locke /Curbed LA flickr pool In the statement announcing the newly minted national landmarks, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell contextualized the importance of the VDL house, saying:\nDuring the 1940s, as Neutra’s work evolved, he also became the well-recognized founder of mid-century “California Modern” architecture. The VDL Research House is the only property where one can see the progression of his style over a period of years and is among the key properties to understanding the national significance of Richard Neutra. \nThe Neutra house was gifted to Cal Poly Pomona in 1980 by Neutra’s widow, Dione. In 2009, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. This latest designation as a National Historic Landmark is intended to go an extra step, to help sites get “technical assistance, recognition and funding to help preserve our nation's shared history and create close-to-home recreation opportunities,” says the official release. \nMichael Locke /Curbed LA flickr pool Michael Locke /Curbed LA flickr pool ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:34:03.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
