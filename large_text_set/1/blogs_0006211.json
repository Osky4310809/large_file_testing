Trump said after meeting with the country’s intelligence... Trump, after intel briefing, insists Russia didn't sway election A damning report by US intelligence and law enforcement agencies released Friday concludes that the Russian government under the direction of the military and President Vladimir Putin employed cyberattacks to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.\n“Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations,” read the 25-page report, prepared by the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency.\n“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,” it read.\n“We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.”\nTrump has repeatedly scoffed at the allegations, and earlier Friday called the probe a politically motivated “witch hunt.”\nTrump met with the country’s intelligence chiefs on Friday and said later there was no evidence that Russian hacking influenced the outcome of the presidential election.\n“While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Trump said in a statement.\nDuring a roughly 90-minute sitdown at Trump Tower, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey briefed the president-elect on Russia’s meddling in the US election.\nTrump did not reveal what was said during the briefing or whether he agreed with their assessment.\nThe president-elect called his briefing constructive.\n“I had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community. I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation,” he said.\nHe also blamed the DNC, saying their computers were hacked because their cybersecurity was lax.\n“There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the RNC had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful,” he said.\nAnd he pledged to tackle the issue of cybersecurity within 90 days of assuming office.\n“Whether it is our government, organizations, associations or businesses we need to aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks. I will appoint a team to give me a plan,” Trump said.", "external_links": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/trump41.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=94&#038;h=62&#038;crop=1", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/trump41.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;w=231&#038;h=154&#038;crop=1"], "published": "2017-01-07T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:46:18.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
