But it seems some people rate it rather highly.\nSee, a cinema staffer randomly found a cucumber lying in an aisle following a Fifty Shades Darker screening.\nSEE ALSO: Fire brigade tweets warning for couples inspired by 'Fifty Shades'\nThe folks at the Hayden Orpheum in Sydney, Australia found the veg, snapping the photo and posted it on Facebook . \"That awkward moment when you find a cucumber in the cinema after a session,\" the cinema wrote.\nWhile it might be easy to dismiss this as a marketing stunt, according to Alex Temesvari, the cinema's Deputy General Manager, the discovery was absolutely real.\n\"Hand on my heart, it was actually found after our Student Night session of Fifty Shades on Monday night (actually by me!),\" he said via email.\n\"Otherwise I would totally take credit for it being a clever marketing ploy, but honestly we're not THAT clever.\"\nAnd yes, people found the photo very amusing. Apart from the hygiene thing.\nAnyway, the cinema doesn't need some AWOL cucumber to promote the film.\nThe sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey is actually killing it in Australia, topping the box office and making with A$6.6 million (US$5 million) in its opening week.\nBONUS: Here are 6 sexy movies to watch instead of 'Fifty Shades' that are sure to put you in the mood", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Forpheum.cremorne%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150990927109464.438502.120443394463%2F10155028318319464%2F%3Ftype%3D3%26comment_id%3D10155028329354464&include_parent=false", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Forpheum.cremorne%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150990927109464.438502.120443394463%2F10155028318319464%2F%3Ftype%3D3%26comment_id%3D10155028331059464&include_parent=false", "https://www.facebook.com/orpheum.cremorne/photos/a.10150990927109464.438502.120443394463/10155028318319464/?type=3", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/S9SzrlsA.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/orpheum.cremorne/posts/10155028318319464:0", "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fifty_shades_darker/", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Forpheum.cremorne%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150990927109464.438502.120443394463%2F10155028318319464%2F%3Ftype%3D3%26comment_id%3D10155028320259464&include_parent=false", "http://www.mpdaa.org.au/customers/mpdaa/mpdaa.nsf/homepage?openform", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/S9SzrlsA.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-15T14:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:59:58.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
