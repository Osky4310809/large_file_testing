And no, I’m not talking blue balls. I mean a touch of the sads. The weepies. Basically, you ever had too much wine alone? Yeah, it’s that feeling. Well, have no fear! I’ve put together a playlist that will titillate AND complement your mopey mood. It’s like our lord and savior Hannah Montana once said, you get the best of both worlds.\nSZA – Drew Barrymore \nSZA has, in my humble opinion, one of the best, sultriest voices in the music industry right now. She could sing the alphabet and it would cause a reaction in my heart and private areas. Sorry, over-sharing? Also, THESE LYRICS. “I get so lonely, I forget what I’m worth / We get so lonely, we pretend that this works.” Ouch. Ouch. Ouchhhh.\nChildish Gambino – Redbone \nThe only Donald we acknowledge. Mr. Glover is a goddamn national treasure. This song is very close to perfection and has been in HEAVY rotation for me ever since it was released. It has these funky Prince (RIP, we miss you) vibes that are so sexually charged, I have a hard time keeping my pants on. “You wanna make it right, but now it’s too late.” \nSophie Meiers, Gin$eng – You Left The Door Open \nThis was a total random find on Spotify, but I love it and makes me want to cry!!!!\nBanks – Lovesick \nBanks. Just. B NKSSSS. You can almost smell the desperate in this song — the begging and wanting. I SIMPLY CANNOT GET ENOUGH. “Cause I’m lovesick / And I ain’t even ashamed / And I’m hard up, for some time in your sheets.” \nRendezvous At Two – F*ck Me & Feed Me \nHer voice is somehow so sweet and innocent, even when she literally says “fuck me and feed me” ??? Can I pull that off? How do you say fuck and still sound angelic? \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T05:01:21.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
