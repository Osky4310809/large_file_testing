Itâ€™s part of a race-based funding formula this progressive state has instituted regarding education since the 1970s, according to a local ABC News outlet: Outrage has grown at Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood, as the school faces layoffs and increased class sizes due to a law limiting funds for schools with a higher white student body. \nThe Los Angeles Unified School District provides more funding for schools where the white population is below 30 percent. \nIn a letter to parents, the district noted the highly regarded middle school had been above the percentage for the past couple years. \nThe racial formula was a condition imposed by court decisions dealing with desegregation in the 1970s. \nYour school funding gets cut because there are too many white kids.
