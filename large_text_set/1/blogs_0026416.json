However, it looks like this year’s party is shaping up to be significantly less festive. News has broke that three of the evening’s most renowned nominees–Kanye West, Drake and Justin Bieber–will all be skipping the ceremony.\nAccording to TMZ , Bieber has let slip that he plans on avoiding this year’s festivities as he finds that they are not “relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers.” Drake, meanwhile, is expected to remain in Europe for his ‘Boy Meets World’ tour.\nKanye’s absence is one that has been presaged by multiple recent comments expressing his distaste for the Grammy system, particularly in regards to Frank Ocean. Ocean made headlines shortly after the release of last year’s excellent Blonde when he chose not to submit the album for any awards consideration, citing a logic similar to Bieber’s belief in their lack of relevance.\nThe 2017 Grammys will be held on February 12. Revisit Justin Bieber’s performance at last year’s Grammy Awards below:\n\nIn related music news, Drake has premiered a brand new song at the opening night of his ‘Boy Meets World’ Tour.
