They are doing good. \n“He was very, very close to both of his sisters. The Greek mentality is to look after people. Melanie made lots of steak. When things are bad they cook – that’s what they do. \n“I’ll be there for the funeral. We just want closure, we want the funeral to happen, it’s been a long time now.” \nThe Sunday Mirror spoke to Kenny in Los Angeles, at Sir Elton John’s AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party. \nKenny, who is close friends with Elton and his husband David Furnish, was a guest of honour on their top table. \n“It’s my second time at this party,” he says. “And I want to support them. They have done so much for charity and it is something very close to mine and George’s heart. We are very passionate about our charities.” \nGeorge met Kenny at posh spa Beverly Hot Springs, in LA, in 1996. \nThey only went public with their ­relationship two years later when the singer came out after being arrested for “a lewd act” in a California toilet.

He stumbles: “I don’t know why I keep saying that.” \nKenny was the Wham! frontman’s true love and they split in 2009, although George did not reveal their break-up for another two years.

This man has brought me a lot of joy and pain. \n“My love life has been a lot more ­turbulent than I’ve ever let on, and I’m so sad about my relationship with Kenny. I’m sorry for any pain.” \nWith a soft Texan drawl and cheery demeanour, it’s clear to see why Kenny had such a positive effect on George’s life. \nHe was credited with helping the star through a string of troubled times.

It was a tricky thing. But Jolene, by Dolly Parton, was one of George’s ­favourite songs and when I was thinking about what to do it started playing on the radio. \n“I thought that was a sign. We had two dogs together and one of them was ­barking a lot, I also thought that was him trying to tell me something. \n“At the end of the day we need to spread the word about the charities. He would have wanted that. That’s the most important thing.” George Michael and Kenny Goss (Photo: FilmMagic) \nTeetotal Kenny has managed to keep himself focused by working on their ­foundation. \nA tribute on the charity’s website says: “George was a major part of my life and I loved him very, very much. \n\"The beautiful memories and music he brought to the world will ­always be an important part of my life and those who also loved and admired him.” \nLosing George has clearly taken its toll on Kenny and as authorities are yet to issue a cause of death it has been ­impossible for him to properly mourn. \nIn January we revealed how Kenny had rekindled his friendship with George and was trying to help him. Kenny Goss opens up about George Michael \nKenny told us: “I was speaking to him all the time on the phone. We were in constant contact. He was in good spirits.” \nBut on Christmas Day George was found dead in bed at home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, by his current ­partner Fadi Fawaz, 43. \nInitial toxicology results were ­inconclusive and more tests are being carried out to determine the cause of death. \nAsked what he thinks happened, Kenny tells us: “I can’t say for sure but I think his body just gave up. All these years, it was just weak.” \nReminiscing about their time together, he continues: “We were together for 15 years and in the gay world that is a long time. George Michael's family are still waiting to bury the star \n\"People used to say we ­argued but we wouldn’t really. It was always just silly things about who had the remote control. \n“When we split up there was no big argument, it was just how it was. It was a lovely relationship. I miss him.” \nGeorge’s philanthropy touched hearts around the world. It recently emerged he gifted £99,000 to Kenyan AIDS charity Omwabini after hearing of its funding problems on Deal Or No Deal. \nKenny adds: “His generosity was ­endless, he helped so many people. \n“We will keep on hearing more and more stories about how he helped others. That is how people will remember him. \n“He was the sweetest person. People talk about him giving away £50,000 but he gave away millions. \nHe always said ‘how much money does one person need’. That’s what he was like.” To learn more about the foundation go to gossmichaelfoundation.org Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:39:37.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
