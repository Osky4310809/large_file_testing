Life Accordion To Trump pic.twitter.com/srw44SKbfL — Huw Parkinson (@rabbitandcoffee) January 13, 2017 \nThe flexible squeezebox adapts seamlessly between the space created by Trump’s endless hand gestures. \nOf course, this is no ordinary accordion – it’s a “custom Trumpcordion made for tiny fingers,” according to political satirist and video creator Huw Parkinson. \nThe shrill accordion tones provide the background for edited speeches in which Trump discusses alleged Russian hacking in the US election and the wall he has proposed building along the border with Mexico. \nThe video, which follows on from previous Trump playing accordion GIFs , has been met by an unsurprisingly humorous reaction, with some viewers even suggesting that Trump himself could be the headline act at his own inauguration next week. @yeslaurenevans @rabbitandcoffee Ridicule may be the only way to survive this presidency or, you know, emigration. — Gordon C.

Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad — Donald J.
