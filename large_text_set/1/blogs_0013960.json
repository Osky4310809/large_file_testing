GETTY Prime Minister Theresa May has welcomed President-elect Donald Trump's vow to secure a trade deal \nBut while it was possible to hold “scoping discussions” before Britain actually leaves the European Union on how to reduce trade barriers, the UK would respect EU rules which ban members from signing their own agreements with other countries until they formally leave the bloc, stressed the spokeswoman. We welcome the commitment from the President-elect to engage with the UK on this Theresa May's spokeswoman \nMr Trump’s comments came in interview with Tory MP, former minister and journalist Michael Gove, a leader of the successful Vote Leave campaign, and German newspaper Bild. \nAsked if it would be possible to get a US-UK trade deal quite quickly, the President-elect said: “Absolutely - very quickly. \n“I’m a big fan of the UK. We’re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly - good for both sides.” \nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson , who last week visited the US for talks with leading Trump advisers , said: “I think it’s very good news that the United States of America want to do a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast and it’s great to hear that from President-elect Donald Trump. \n“Clearly it will have to be a deal that is very much in the interests of both sides but I have no doubt that it will be.” \nMr Gove told broadcasters: “I think the President-elect wants to have something signature-ready at the earliest possible opportunity.” GETTY Mrs May's spokeswoman said it highlighted the opportunities of the UK leaving the EU \nMr Trump would want a “win-win deal” and was “enthusiastic” about Brexit , he said, adding: “He stressed that he believed the EU would potentially break up in the future and that other countries would leave. \n\"So in a sense he is both emotionally and financially invested in it.” \nThe offer of a US trade deal would strengthen Mrs May’s hand in her Brexit negotiations with Brussels, Mr Gove believed. GETTY Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was 'great' to hear from Mr Trump \n“The EU until now has been assumed to have a better hand to play, but the Prime Minister we now see has actually cards in her hand, including from candidate Trump, which will enable her, I think, to secure a better deal.” \nThe MP said he had found Mr Trump to be “warmer” in person than he had expected. \nMr Trump should be viewed as a businessman: “The important thing about any world leader dealing with Donald Trump is to think ‘how can I get a deal that suits us both’.” \nHis trade deal comments should also be regarded as “sincere”.

GETTY Michael Gove believes a US trade deal will strengthen the PM's hand in Brexit negotiations \n“Now he says that he wants to make a success of it. He thinks we are ‘doing great’, as he said in the interview. \n\"That goodwill, I think, will extend into making sure that we can do all the preparatory work at the earliest possible stage in order to get the best possible deal.” \nFormer UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who was among the first foreign politicians to meet Mr Trump after his shock election win and who will be in Washington for the inauguration, Tweeted that the interview contained “no surprises” but showed there were “serious opportunities” to be had with the arrival of the new President. GETTY Mr Trump will be sworn in as American President on Friday \nFormer Bill Clinton advisor Albert Scardino warned Mr Trump would find it harder to get things done as President than as a businessman - and that the UK-US trade deal may be delayed by the need to secure the American Senate’s approval. \nMr Trump also said he believed other countries would follow Britain out of the EU, saying: “People, countries want their own identity ...” \nBut EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said: “I’m not worried. I think this idea that Brexit is going to be contagious is a fantasy - a bad fantasy.
