It is absolutely right that parliamentarians do all that they can to mitigate its impact”.\nKate Osamor, the shadow secretary of state for international development, is also calling on the government to help bridge the gap and make sure that these organisations can still function without American help.\n“It is imperative that we safeguard the right of women everywhere to have autonomy over their own bodies, and this contradictory policy means that potentially both abortion services and contraception would be withheld from women who need them,” Osamor told BuzzFeed News.\nTrump announced on Monday that he would be reinstating the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, which means the US will stop funding organisations providing abortion services.\nA spokesperson for Marie Stopes warned: “Without alternative funding, the loss of [their] services alone will result in 6.5 million unintended pregnancies, 2.2 million abortions, 2.1 million unsafe abortions and 21,700 maternal deaths between 2017 and 2020.\n“The Secretary of State for International Development must commit to ensuring the government will continue to support the work of NGOs across the globe who provide these vital services and issue a strong statement on her intention to do so”.\nTrump’s policy equates to a blanket ban on the funding of all NGOs worldwide that are involved in abortions, or even handing out information about abortions, even if abortions are legal in the country in question.\nIn 2016, the US had allocated $608 million for family planning and $9.5 billion for global health organisations – both budgets now come under the gag rule.\nThe Marie Stopes spokesperson added: “Women and girls who lack access to a choice of family planning methods are less likely to complete education, have a career, or be able to pursue their plans and dreams for the future.\n“They are more likely to experience unintended pregnancy, and more likely to risk death and disability by undergoing an unsafe abortion.”\nA spokesperson for DFID declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T20:46:35.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
