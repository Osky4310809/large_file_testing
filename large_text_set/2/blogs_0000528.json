They’re the most awful parts of an animal and are really unappealing products that are cheap as dirt. We’ve replaced them with really high quality plant food.” Thursday 2 February 2017 12:36 BST Click to followIndy Lifestyle Online Forest Green Rovers' chairman, Dale Vince \nOver the last 10 years there has been a 360% increase in the number of vegans in the UK. No longer the preserve of hemp-wearing hippies with dreadlocks, veganism has hit the mainstream. \nBut one person has been particularly pioneering in expanding the reach of a vegan lifestyle - Dale Vince, the chairman of Forest Green Rovers Football Club . \nThanks to Vince, the club has been fully vegan since June 2014. That means there’s no meat, fish, dairy or animal products of any kind on offer at the club, whether for players, visitors or fans. Meet the man who lost 200lbs to become a vegan marathon runner \nIt wasn’t, however, a sudden change, but rather a gradual move. \nIn October 2010, just days after he became chairman of the club, Vince - a green energy tycoon and founder of Ecotricity - took red meat off the menu. \nBefore his arrival, players were often served lasagne before matches, but Vince thought this was a mistake as red meat is difficult to digest: “It seemed to me wrong to be feeding players something that would hinder their performance,” he told The Independent . \nA while later he stopped the club serving white meat, then fish, followed by milk and cheese, and by the start of the season in June 2014, the Gloucestershire club was fully vegan and has been ever since. \n“Personally I’m vegan and have very strong views on the environment, animal welfare and human health,” Vince explains. Motivational quotes from Plant Built vegan athletes - in pictures Motivational quotes from Plant Built vegan athletes - in pictures 1/6 \nChristine Crumbley is a 30-year-old research scientist from Houston, Texas, who specialises in studying how lifestyle and disease intersect. \"Take the time to learn how to cook vegan food, including learning how to press tofu, how to combine different spices to create different flavors, and how to prepare vegetables in new and interesting ways. The best approach for us is weekly meal prep. I reheat food, and all the ingredients for lunches is already prepared. I save money by not going out to eat every time I'm tired.\" Plant Built 2/6 \nErin Fergus, 33, is Plant Built's women's bodybuilding team captain and the Academic Program Director of the Personal Training Department at Greenville Technical College. \"Most people not only don’t know just how many non-animal protein sources exist, but they also think that they need more than they actually do and/or don’t understand its function in our bodies (hint: it’s doesn’t give you energy, fuel or power.)\" Plant Built 3/6 \nJason Patton is a 33-year-old powerlifter from Portland, Oregon. He is a project specialist for the Oregon Pediatric Society. \"Going vegan is a behavioral change. Like all behavioral changes it is not instantaneous, and it can be extremely easy to get side-tracked. It is important to create a social life where you are engaged with other vegans. Secondly, educate yourself, and receive the education others try to teach you. Learn how to make healthy life choices within your veganism.\" Plant Built 4/6 \nJason Morgan is 35-years-old, and lives in Dayton, Ohio. He is a diet technician. \"Don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo. I was too old, a vegan, and had too many kids when I started lifting at the age of 31, but it hasn’t stopped me from competing in the sports that I value, Strongman and powerlifting. I’ve competed in USA Powerlifting, and North American Strongman as a 105kg/231kg drug free competitor in the open classes.\" Plant Built 5/6 \nScott Green is a 40-year-old personal trainer, kettlebell sports coach and martial arts instructor in Los Angeles. \"I grew up in the punk and hardcore subculture. At age 14, I made a lifelong commitment to being straightedge, which means abstaining from drugs and alcohol. That exposed me to vegan straightedge bands. When I went vegetarian, it was more about trying to be healthier, but when I went vegan, it was for the animals. Trying to do less harm in the world brings peace within myself. I've never looked back.\" Plant Built 6/6 \nCarolyn Napier, 30, is a CrossFit trainer and realtor from Oklahoma. \"Being vegan isn't hard nor is it more expensive. I think those are the two biggest misconceptions. It is all really simple and there are so many companies these days that make faux meats, cheeses and desserts that it makes some of those comfort foods really accessible without causing any harm to the animals.\" Plant Built \n“I couldn't be involved in something that was catering that kind of menu, but rather than do it in one go we went on a journey with our fans.” \nAnd it turned out the fans were surprisingly OK with the decision. The vegan bodybuilding duo who say their plant diet gives them an edge \n“A few got a bit angry and thought we were dictating to them what they could and couldn’t eat,” Vince says. “But we just explained that we were changing the menu according to our principals.” \nDespite traditional football match fare consisting of burgers and beers, there was relatively little backlash to the decision, but it was the initial removal of red meat from the menu that garnered the biggest reaction. \n“Typically football food is hideous,” Vince believes. “Burgers are really awful. They’re the most awful parts of an animal and are really unappealing products that are cheap as dirt. We’ve replaced them with really high quality plant food.” \nConsidering home games are just two hours once a fortnight, it’s not too much to ask of even the biggest meat-eater. “For those that are really bothered they can bring their own ham sandwiches,” Vince suggests. \nHe was simply trying to introduce a new kind of food to football that most fans hadn’t tried before. “We didn’t focus on what was not in the food but the food itself and how good it tastes,” Vince explains. Some of the vegan food served by Forest Green Rovers () \nForest Green Rovers fans can now expect to enjoy veggie burgers (“our fans have really taken to them”), wraps and falafel when they come to matches. \nThere are still pies too - one of Vince’s favourites is a vegan Quorn pie encased in vegan pastry, served on a bed of mashed potato, surrounded by peas and topped with fried, shredded leeks and gravy. “It’s the most amazing dish,” he says. \nSome FGR fans have even become vegetarians since the club took meat off the menu, which Vince is obviously thrilled about: “They’ve told us it’s changed their lives,” he says. \nBut what about the players? Could vegan fare give them enough sustenance to run around a football pitch?
