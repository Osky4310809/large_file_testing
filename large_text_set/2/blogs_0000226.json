With a post on Instagram, Chris Boswell announced his return to Pittsburgh in a photo showing him putting pen to paper he entitled “Blessed for another year with #SteelersNation !!”\nBlessed for another year with #SteelersNation !! \nA photo posted by Chris Boswell (@chrisboswell9) on Feb 2, 2017 at 12:50pm PST \nRelated: Antonio Brown reflects on his Facebook Live video \nWith just two years in the league and therefore an exclusive rights free agent, Boswell will have signed a one-year deal worth $615,000. He will become a restricted free agent in 2018 and should be easy to retain. After the re-signing of long snapper Greg Warren earlier in the week, the Steelers now have all three key parts of their special teams unit under contract for next season.\nFollowing this latest signing, the Steelers have seven ERFA’s still unsigned as of Thursday and should have most of the remainder under contract very soon. The outstanding names include OT Alejandro Villanueva, TE Xavier Grimble, OLB Anthony Chickillo, C B.J. Finney, OG Cole Manhart, C Valerian Ume-Ezeoke, and ILB Kevin Anderson.\nRelated: What did we learn from the Steelers 2016 season?
