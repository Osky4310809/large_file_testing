The key? Performing hands-only CPR correctly . To do so, you need to perform 100 compressions per minute, pushing down hard and fast, NewYork-Presbyterian says. Use songs with 100 beats per minute as a guide. Here are the top 5 songs on the playlist they created to get you there : “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees, “Cecilia,” by Simon & Garfunkel, “Hard to Handle” by the Black Crowes, “Sweet Home Alabama,” by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and “Rock Your Body” by Justin Timberlake. \nSkip the “Eraser Challenge” Yes, people do stupid things and share them online. But there’s one new “challenge” kids are getting wrapped up in that might be more harmful than you think. It’s called the “eraser challenge,” where kids use erasers to rub away the skin on their arms, CBS News reports . Doctors say it can cause serious burns, as well as scarring and local infections.

In many cases, these foods actually had worse nutritional profiles than their counterparts that weren’t making the claims.

For instance, some foods that strip out the fat might be adding more sugar to it to make it palatable. \nSniff Out Death Have a keen sense of smell? That may bode well for your longevity , a study from Sweden suggests. For every odor participants were able to correctly identify, their risk of dying during the 10-year follow up dropped by 8 percent. Previous research has linked loss of smell to dementia, but this study controlled for that, suggesting that it might be an independent marker of deteriorating health.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T16:56:06.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
