If everyone is happy then I hope something gets done, but if not, I have a huge respect for the manager and the club so they know my feelings and it is nothing other than wanting to play. \n\"It has been obviously not the longest relationship [with Conte], but so far, so good. We are quite open about it. He knows I am desperate to play and that's all it is really. If he can make it happen for me then he will, but it won't be just like that for anyone and if it can happen, in the next couple of days, then so be it. For me, it is about wanting to play.\" \nThibaut Courtois has been in sensational form for Chelsea this season and leads the way in Europe, in terms of keeping clean sheets, which has restricted Begovic to starts in just the cup games. \nBegovic said that he doesn't regret his move to Chelsea and that he admires Courtois despite the competition for places. He went on to add that he thinks that he is good enough to be regarded as one of the world's best - just like his current club's No.1 goalkeeper is. \n\"Of course [I thought I could compete],\" he added. \"Because chances to play for Chelsea don't come around everyday and top clubs like this in general. When they come around, if you don't believe in yourself, and don't think things can happen for yourself then you shouldn't be in this game. \n\"I truly believed there was a chance and something could happen, and ultimately I didn't get as many games as I would have liked. Thibaut is on absolute fire this year and is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, I knew that, and I wanted to test myself against those guys. \n\"I feel like I am one of them [the best] but unfortunately no club is big enough to have two really good goalkeepers. I do [I feel like a great player], that's the thing as well. I am 29, 30 in the summer and I feel fantastic. \n\"I feel in such great shape that it would be a waste not to play and show people what I can do. That's the only thing, I do believe that I can play at this level and show everyone what I can do and that remains to be seen.\" \nThe 29-year-old admitted that the toughest part about potentially leaving would be missing out on a Premier League title, but he thinks that is not enough motivation on its own to stay at the club. \n\"That's a tough part and I hope the team lifts the title and maybe I will be part of that. It is difficult to say, but it is difficult when you don't play for a certain amount of time and that overrides everything,\" he explained. \n\"I am a footballer, I like to play and I came here to challenge myself. I have enjoyed everything so far and if I am still here then I will continue to work hard and that's all I can do. \nWest Ham fans fume over Payet tweet \n\"It is the best squad in the league for sure, it is a disposal of riches but that is what this club can do and have. It is fantastic, working with these guys on a daily basis is pretty awesome and when they come in like this it is like nothing and we don't miss a beat. \n\"I think you need to rotate and not having Champions League may have helped us to focus a little bit on our training and everything else. I think a squad, with the demands of the game and how long the season is, it is crucial for any success.\" \nChelsea are looking to bring in either Celtic's Craig Gordon or Sevilla's Salvatore Sirigu as a replacement ahead of transfer deadline day on Tuesday night.
