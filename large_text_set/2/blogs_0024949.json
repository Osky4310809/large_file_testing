Mo Brooks (R-AL) tells us we're on the right track . \n\"I'll tell you, Toni, there are a, in my opinion, a significant number of congressmen who are being impacted by these kinds of protests and their spine is a little bit weak,\" the Alabama congressman said in an interview on \"The Morning Show with Toni & Gary\" on WBHP 800 Alabama radio. \"And I don't know if we're going to be able to repeal Obamacare now because these folks who support Obamacare are very active, they're putting pressure on congressman and there's not a counter-effort to steal the spine of some of these congressmen in tossup districts around the country.\" \nBrooks continued, \"And you may not even see a vote to repeal Obamacare, you might see something where they call it a repeal but really it's an amendment. You and I have talked about this before. We need an outright repeal of Obamacare and then whatever's gonna come after it, fine, let's have that discussion. But this monstrosity needs to be repealed and right now, in my judgment, we don't have the votes in Congress to pass a repeal bill, in part because of what these people are doing.\" \nThat's maybe a better excuse than former House Speaker John Boehner's summation for why Republicans won't be able to repeal —because Republicans will never figure out a way to get everyone on board with it. \"In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once,” Boehner said. “And all this happy talk that went on in November and December and January about repeal, repeal, repeal—yeah, we'll do replace, replace—I started laughing, because if you pass repeal without replace, first, anything that happens is your fault. You broke it.” […] \n\"And secondly, as I told some of the Republican leaders when they asked, I said, if you pass repeal without replace you'll never pass replace, because they will never ever agree on what the bill should be. Perfect always becomes the enemy of the good,” Boehner said. \nCasting failure as \"being responsive to the people\" would save them some face, as opposed to just being too incompetent and fractured. Regardless, we've got our marching orders. Keep resisting!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:17:37.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
