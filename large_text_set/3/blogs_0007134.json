You can supplement it with different types of technologies and so forth.” \nAnd noting that “when you're talking about a wall that's, you know, several thousand miles long, there's going to be certain places where a certain type of wall are more appropriate than others,” Mulvaney suggested that parts could be “see-through.” \n“Some places, a solid concrete barrier might be desired,” Mulvaney said. “In other places, the border folks are actually telling us, border control's actually telling us that they like the one you can see through, because it reduces the number of violent attacks on our folks. So it's a complicated program.” \nFirst of all, Mulvaney’s claim that he has no idea how much the wall will ultimately cost is bullshit. \nLast month, Reuters got a preview of a DHS report that put the estimated cost at up to $21.6 billion, nearly triple the estimate that Trump himself put forward a year ago. And according to MSNBC, some DC budget folks think that the real construction costs could balloon up to $50 billion “when all is said and done.” Yup, $50 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars for a physical monument to Donald Trump’s racism. If this scam were any bigger, it could be a course at Trump University. \nO ne thing Mulvaney gets right is that some parts of the wall could be “see-through,” but that’s only because geological and other physical barriers along the U.S./Mexico border could make construction just about as impossible as Trump getting through a weekend without golfing: \nCiting everything from bedrock depth to soil chemistry, experts say building a wall spanning the 2,000-mile border will be much tougher than erecting one of Trump's trademark skyscrapers. \n“Earth doesn’t forgive sloppy,” field geologist Mika McKinnon warned in a tweet following Trump’s directive last month to design and construct the wall. \nThe southern border between the U.S. and Mexico is made up of wetlands, grasslands, desert, rivers, mountains and forests – all of which could pose pitfalls for builders. \nSwaths of the area also feature a thick layer of loose sediment – like dirt, sand and soil – on top. Some spots are packed with hydrophilic clay soil, which swells, moves and could destroy the foundation. \n“In some places the bedrock will be too deep – you’ll never be able to reach the bedrock in an affordable fashion,” McKinnon told Smithsonian Magazine . \nAnd that doesn’t even include the fact that the wall would have to cut through sacred tribal lands. 'Over my dead body' will a wall be built, said the Tohono O’odham Nation, a federally-recognized tribe. Other border state residents seem to agree: \nAbout 72 percent of people living on the U.S. side of the border and 86 percent of people living on the Mexican side are opposed to building a wall, a poll funded by Cronkite News, Univision News, and Dallas Morning News found. Building out a border wall also isn’t on the top of their priority list — 77 percent of Mexicans and 70 percent of Americans found that the economy, crime, and education were more important than border issues. \nSo Mulvaney could be telling us a non-alternative fact when he says parts of the wall could be “see-through”—but only because there won’t be an actual wall there in the first place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:54:58.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
