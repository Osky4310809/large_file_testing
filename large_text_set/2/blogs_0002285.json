Rowling is not shy on Twitter about her political convictions, making her opinions on Donald Trump’s refugee travel ban heard loud and clear on Twitter. She’s a passionate champion of common sense. I.E.:\nHe. Is. A. Terrorist. Not. A. Lone. Wolf. pic.twitter.com/OO3qDGhzwr \n— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 30, 2017 \n\nOne thing she spends zero bullshit with is Trump’s army of faceless, boderline-fascist alt-right Twitter egg cucks. So when people with Pepe memes try to spit hate in her direction, she chews them up and spits right back at them. She’s been particularly busy the last couple days, given the international discourse around the so-called Travel Ban.\n*sighs* Well, who knows? If I try harder, I might be reincarnated as a lonely virgin hiding behind a cartoon frog. pic.twitter.com/EbocdxfJ5o \n— J.K.

I quite like 'old whore', though. #Shakespearean pic.twitter.com/0pIEVfrGn7 \n— J.K.

Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 30, 2017 \n\nAnd now for the ultimate in savagery, the Harry Potter author went for the jugular to an alt-right cuck who wants to burn J.K. Rowling’s books “and movies”.\nWell, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money, so by all means borrow my lighter. pic.twitter.com/kVoi8VGEoK \n— J.K.
