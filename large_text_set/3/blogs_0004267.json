When I look back I would say Chelsea were one of the main teams that if things didn’t go their way, they’d surround the referee every time. They’d try to get into your head and make you change your mind. I remember sending off John Terry in a game versus Manchester City and he knocked on my dressing room door after the game. In the end we had a pleasant discussion and he understood why I had sent him off but he still didn’t agree with it. That’s one of the things about being a referee, people can understand your decision but not everyone will agree. \nThat’s where mental strength is a huge attribute to have as a referee. Sometimes when you’ve made a decision and you have five players surrounding you, shouting at you, as well as having the crowd in the background chanting ‘you don’t know what you’re doing’, it’s really hard to keep positive, have confidence in yourself and your decision making. If you’re not confident and you have players surrounding you, they will pick up on that straight away, and so will the crowd.

In situations like that I would discuss with the captain rather than keep pulling the player up and hope they would get through to him. I had a good relationship with Steven Gerrard so I’d say to him ‘Steven sort him out, if you don’t sort him out I will’ and then he’d give the heads up to the player. That’s why it was important to have a good relationship with the players, especially the captain as it would allow me to take control of a game without creating a bigger deal out of a situation. \nOn one occasion, Fernando Torres got the better of me, he got into my head, and that was something that very rarely happened. He said something to me which I didn’t like, so I ended up chasing him along the pitch, something happened elsewhere on the pitch and I missed that so I blew the whistle. Using my relationship with Frank Lampard I said to him, ‘Frank he is a pain in the backside’ and Frank said ‘tell me about it, we have him in training every day and he is a pain!’ so that sometimes makes you feel better when it’s not just you that has those feelings.

You want to put your point across, but its protocol for all referees that you do not speak to media; you aren’t even allowed to be on social media, let alone discuss with the press. That’s the time where you would use your referee coach to help you deal with that side of the job. Many would like to speak to the media and explain their decisions, but where would you draw the line? The best way is to not read the media, keep your head down and focus on the next game. At the end of the day that’s the most important thing, your next performance. \n*To find out more about the Betfair Back The Whistleblowers campaign, go to https://betting.betfair.com/ Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:27:15.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
