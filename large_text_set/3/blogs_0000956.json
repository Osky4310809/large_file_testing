Technically speaking, Ulta has quietly offered K-beauty serums , essences , and sheet masks from Seoul giants Tony Moly, Missha , and Skin Food for the last year or so, but it was the beauty retailer's recent partnership with Landing International , an online marketplace for a slew of fashion- and beauty-based businesses, that brought in the K-beauty big guns. With the new collaboration, Landing International is bringing in the best of six brands—O.R.G., SKINRx LAB, Thank You Farmer, COSRX, Botanic Farm, and Cle—with a total of 24 products, plus one \"K-Beauty Survival Kit.\" You May Also Like Skin The Best Peel-Off Masks to Try Right Now Of the lot, notable mentions include a spray-on exfoliator—made with exfoliating grapefruit seed extract and nourishing milk thistle—from O.R.G., called the Mineral Peel Face (which, yes, is similar to this Allure editor-loved mist ), the Cle Radiant Skin Melting Cleanser, which has hydrating sodium hyaluronate (the salt of hyaluronic acid) to moisturize skin while it's wiping away days-old mascara smudges, and the detoxifying COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid made with willow bark to target blackheads, breakouts, and dirt overload while tightening pores.
