Embryo selection for IVF Credit: Brand X \nT heir findings were presented at Fertility 2017, which was held in Edinburgh earlier this month. \nDagan Wells, an associate professor at the University of Oxford who has been involved in the study of human embryos for more than two decades, said it was possible the vibrations from the music created similar conditions to those in the womb immediately after conception. \nHe said: “It is possible that vibrations could simulate some of these effects by agitating the medium, helping to mix the fluid in which the embryo is immersed, diluting potentially harmful chemicals excreted by the embryo and increasing exposure to important nutrients.” \nHe added that there was still “much room for improvement” when it came to IVF treatment, although admitted it had “improved dramatically” in recent years. What if IVF doesn’t work? \nI t is not the first time the effects of music have been tested. Researchers at a clinic in Barcelona in 2013 said they found playing artists including Madonna, Metallic and Bach appeared to help eggs grow. \nThey told the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology’s annual conference in London that year that the songs helped increase the chances of eggs being fertilised by around 5 per cent.
