The comments also cost him his invitation to speak at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference\n“I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues’ important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately,” Yiannopoulos said in a statement. “This decision is mine alone. When your friends have done right by you, you do right by them. For me, now, that means stepping aside so my colleagues at Breitbart can get back to the great work they do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:46:45.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
