By: Rajeev Kumar | New Delhi | Published: February 20, 2017 2:49 PM Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an election rally in Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. (PTI Photo) \nWhile Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi have focussed much of their energy in launching personal attacks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the ongoing Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the latter has been drawing parallels from history to attack the SP-Congress alliance. In the name of history, all Akhilesh and Rahul have been able to claim against PM Modi is his alleged role in 2002 Gujarat riots and attack him over demonetisation drive. While Modi has walked taint-free from the allegations against him over the riots, opposition attack on Modi over the issue only works in his favour. This has been proven time and again. \nElections are won by perceptions. Leaders’ ability to put their opponents in a tricky situation, when there are not much issues to blame the latter, it helps how the former sell their allegations against the latter to the public. In this aspect, the young duo of Rahul and Akhilesh has been failing to find right issues to attack PM Modi, even as the latter has been growing strong. Modi has even dug out instances from the past to mock the SP-Congress alliance. \nNot just Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today took a dig at the Samajwadi Party and Congress alliance also. Speaking at a rally in Orai ahead of the fourth phase of Assembly elections in UP, Modi said he was wondering as to how the Congress and SP became friends. And after much thinking, Modi said, he found that both parties were natural allies. Drawing parallels between Akhilesh Yadav and Congress’ Rahul Gandhi, PM Modi said then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had laid the foundation stone of a glass factory in Chitrakoot but it was never set up. Similarly, he said, Akhilesh inaugurated Lucknow Metro ahead of the elections, even as it is yet to open for the public. \nRecently, he said that the Congress has tried to kill Akhilesh’s father and former SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1984, yet the UP chief minister joined hands with the Congress. Modi was referring to an incident in which Mulayam’s vehicle was fired at allegedly on the directions of Congress in 1984. Mulayam was a rising politician in those days, while Congress was the most powerful political force in the country then. \nOne hopes Rahul and Akhilesh would also take to history books and find something soon to attack Modi, before the poll ground start slipping beneath their feet.
