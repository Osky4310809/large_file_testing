Danielle's body was found on a beach (Photo: Caters) \nThe local petty criminal has been charged with her murder and will appear in court again in a week’s time. \nDetectives say Danielle and Vikat bought two bottles of beer and had a row with a bar owner before driving off on a scooter at about 9.30pm on the night of her murder. \nThe pair had been pictured earlier in the evening at a beach party. \nVikat allegedly tried to cover up the murder by hiding her blood stained clothes in a backpack in a field near his house.
