Sanders and his disturbing “Double Down” sandwich, Taco Bell is about to get in the “let’s just use chicken to hold the chicken” game. The Naked Chicken Chalupa throws away the tortilla and just uses crispy fried chicken as the holder of your standard taco filling. It's like they finally realized that we're wasting time with the whole living like civilized people thing. Taco Bell explains it’s new Frankenfood: “Something this delicious yet different is bound to ruffle some feathers; some might even cluck their tongues at it,” Marisa Thalberg, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell Corp said in a press release. “However, we feel confident that once our fans get a taste of the Naked Chicken Chalupa they are going to understand exactly why this is our next big, fun and craveable innovation, following in the footsteps of the Doritos Locos Tacos five years ago and the Quesalupa just last year.” Taco Bell has gone completely insane, and it's great. You'll be able to get your new Naked Chicken Chalupa on January 26, so start making your necessary doctor's appointments now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:25:50.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
