Photo: Steven Siewert \n\"Even in the 1970s, a woman making a phone call to a man was considered subversive,\" Watson says. \"In the south there was a hierarchy and women were ranked below men. A woman could lose what privileges she had just for stepping out of line or putting herself at the same level as a man.\" \nIn Crimes of the Heart , the youngest of the three sisters in the play, Babe, has just brought her man down a peg or two by shooting him in the stomach. The sisters have gathered in the kitchen of their granddaddy's home to try to sort out the mess. Before they can do that, however, there are unresolved issues and resentments from a difficult shared past to be raked over. \nA Broadway hit in 1981, Crimes of the Heart went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for drama. It was later adapted into a 1986 film directed by Bruce Beresford and starring Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange. \nRenae Small plays Babe in Watson's production. \"I was drawn to it initially because these are three kick-ass roles for women and you don't see that too often,\" she says. \"But by the time I finished reading the play for the first time, I was crying. The storytelling is divine. I don't think you find many plays that feel so cathartic. It's not like anything that's been on at the Old Fitz before.\" Advertisement \nWatson, who returns to the Fitz for the first time since co-directing and acting in Edward Allan Baker's sibling drama Dolores in 2015, says Crimes of the Heart is a play with roots in the southern Gothic tradition typified by Flannery O'Connor and Tennessee Williams. \n\"The language takes you on a journey even when you are looking at it on the page,\" Watson says. \"It demands a certain size of performance, something large enough to meet the language, which is quite extreme at times. But at the same time the performances have to be really truthful. It's a really exciting challenge.\" \nLaura Pike plays elder sister Lenny, coming to terms with limited romantic and motherhood prospects and the death of a beloved pet horse. \n\"I come from a family of three sisters, too,\" Pike says. \"I see so many similarities. When you have grown up with people, you know all their triggers and they know yours. So much drama and conflict and excitement can be made so quickly.\" \nAmanda McGregor plays middle sister Meg, a would-be singer with mental health issues. It's a reunion of sorts, she says â€“ she worked on the character in a class with American acting guru Larry Moss. \"She's a very liberating character to play,\" she says. \"They all are. For once, we get to play women who are not being defined by men. They are on a wild ride of their own.\" \nCrimes is Watson's first show after a year spent with the Ensemble Theatre as the winner of the inaugural Sandra Bates Director Award, a prize offering mentorship and work experience for emerging directors. \n\"I don't think I would have been prepared if I hadn't gone to the Ensemble,\" Watson says \"I assisted on Tribes , which is very much about family dynamics. I also worked on Relatively Speaking , which is all about that delicate balance of truth and comedy. It's been a great experience and you come out feeling like there are people who are in your corner.\" \nWatson's production is played in a detailed recreation of a kitchen. The coffee pot will be boiling. There's baking to be done. \"Our hope is that audiences can immerse themselves in this world,\" she says. \"It will be a place where actors meet the audience as well as the audience meeting the characters.\" \nCrimes of the Heart \nWhere Old Fitzroy Theatre, Woolloomooloo When March 15- April 8, Tuesday-Saturday, 8.15pm; Sunday, 6.30pm, $30-$42, redlineproductions.com.au Director Janine Watson Stars Caleb Alloway, Rowan Davie, Amanda McGregor, Laura Pike, Renae Small, Amy Usherwood Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T03:54:48.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
