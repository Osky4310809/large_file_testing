Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSeamus Coleman suffered an horrific broken leg in Ireland's World Cup qualifying clash with Wales on Friday. \nThe Everton right-back was tackled hard by Wales' Neil Taylor and had both his tibia and fibula fractured in the challenge. \nSpeaking to BBC Five Live, Ireland manager Martin O'Neill said he would only be guessing if he was to put a timescale on when Coleman will be back in action. \nLeg breaks often pose further complications down the line and are among the worst injuries a professional player can sustain. \nBelow we look at nine of football's worst leg breaks and see how long it took the individuals to recover from their injuries.

Djibril Cisse \nThe Frenchman was very unlucky in that he broke his leg twice during his playing career. \nDjibril Cisse's first horrific injury came in Liverpool's game against Blackburn back in 2004, when he came off second best in a challenge with Jay McEveley. Djibril Cisse was very unlucky in that he broke his leg twice (Photo: Getty) \nHis second - this time his right leg - came in France's World Cup friendly against China in 2006, and delayed his transfer to Marseille at the time. \nDespite the severity of both injuries, Cisse was back playing football after just seven months in the two separate ocassions. Alan Smith \nThe Manchester United man broke his leg in an FA Cup defeat to Liverpool back in 2006. \nAlan Smith also dislocated his ankle in the same injury and at the time was expected to be out of the game for at least nine months.

Abou Diaby \nThe Arsenal man fractured his ankle and ruptured ligaments in his leg in a 3-0 win over Sunderland in 2006. \nAbou Diaby made a return to football eight months later, but the injury appeared to have a profound effect on his career.

Kieron Dyer The West Ham man had never been a stranger to the treatment table, but easily the most serious injury of his career came in 2007. Kieron Dyer, who had only joined the Hammers from Newcastle three weeks earlier, broke his right leg in two places following a nasty tackle from Bristol Rovers left-back Joe Jacobson.

Eduardo Almost exactly two years to the day before Aaron Ramsey's horror injury, Eduardo suffered a terrible leg break following a tackle by Birmingham's Martin Taylor in 2008. As well as breaking his left fibula, the striker's injury was further complicate by an open dislocation of his left ankle.

Eduardo returned for Arsenal a year later but was not the same player he had been. Aaron Ramsey \nThe Arsenal midfielder broke his leg when he came off second best in a challenge with Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross in 2010. \nThe Welshman spent nine months on the sidelines recovering from the injury before returning to the Gunners squad.

Luke Shaw \nThe Manchester United and England left-back feared he might never play again after suffering an horrific double leg-break. \nLuke Shaw was out of action for 10 months after suffering the appalling injury in a Champions League game against PSV.

David Busst Arguably the most infamous of footballing injuries, which occurred in 1996. While the BBC and Sky refrained from showing the stomach-churning effects of the Coventry defender's collision with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin, the look of horror on United keeper Peter Schmeichel's face painted a vivid picture of just how serious the injury was. Busst suffered a double compound fracture with the impact of the clash causing his cracked fibula bone to pierce the skin. David Busst never played professionally again after his 1996 leg-break (Photo: Getty) The match had to be delayed for 15 minutes while the blood was cleaned off the pitch at Old Trafford, while Schmeichel had to undergo counselling for a number of weeks following the incident. Sadly, Busst never played professionally again. Having faced the very real prospect of having his injured leg amputated, it's likely he felt grateful for being at least able to walk. poll loading Will Seamus Coleman play again in 2017? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T20:39:10.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
