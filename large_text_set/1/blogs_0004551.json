But Studio Bazi founder and architect Alireza Nemati manages to make it work in style with his self-designed micro-apartment in Moscow. The tiny apartment, which he shares with his wife, makes the most of its small footprint with a few clever space-saving tricks and custom furnishings, including a smartly designed bedroom. \nCentral to Nemati’s design was the need for an open-plan space that maximized natural light but still preserved privacy for the sleeping areas. The key to his successful design lay with his custom wooden sleeping box stacked above storage space located next to the entrance. This use of a level change effectively separates the sleeping quarters from the living areas without the need for a separate room and door, while providing much-needed storage space underneath. The box is clad in stained pine sheets to visually define the structure and to add warmth to the interior. \nRelated: Bookshelf House fits hundreds of books into multifunctional furnishings \n“The wooden sleep box with storage system provides a level of privacy separating the sleeping quarters in a raised corner of the apartment, from the kitchen and living area on the other side,” writes the architect. “There is a good view of whole flat and to the windows from inside of the sleep box which makes it very cozy place.” The stairs that lead up to the bed hide three large sliding shelves for storing large household appliances. The custom-built furniture also includes a dresser, drawer, and wardrobe. The storage spaces atop the wardrobe connect to the sleep box and create an extra cubby for the architect and his wife to use. \nA small set of white curtains provides privacy for the sleeping box while a larger set of brown curtains next to the sleeping box cordon off the entrance, wardrobe area, and door to the bathroom from the rest of the open-plan living space. Large windows fill the tiny apartment with natural light and a door opens up to a small outdoor patio. The open-plan space includes a kitchen, dining area, and living area with moveable and transformable furniture that can adapt to Nemati and his wife’s different needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:27:24.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
