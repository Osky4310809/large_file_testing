At the tail-end of 2016, the company unveiled its first-ever hardware product known as “ Spectacles ,” with reports now suggesting a smartphone could be the next big release.\nAccording to Mediakix, holding company Snap Inc. recently embarked on a hiring mission to reinforce its hardware engineering, telecommunications, and manufacturing logistics departments. The article continues that, “of the 36 new hires since August of 2016, 16 have previous experience from Motorola, 7 from Apple, 6 from Google, 3 from HTC, and one each from Verizon and Nokia.” Putting two and two together, that suggests Snap is working on something far bigger than Spectacles.\nAdding further fuel to the flames is the fact Snap Inc. recently rebranded as a camera company. Apps, it seems, is only a small part of a wider mission.\nLike they did for the specs , Mediakix then provided a detailed mock-up of what a Snapchat phone might look like.\nAccording to the speculative graphics, the camera-centric piece would come equipped with a 360-degree shooter and a one-touch capture button for ease of upload to the app. Not only is it compatible with the Spectacles, but a “Discover” function allows the user to seek out other Snapchatters.\nWould you be interested in a product like the above? Let us know in the comments.\nStaying with phones, here are eight features we’d like to see on the Samsung Galaxy S8 .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:12:19.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
