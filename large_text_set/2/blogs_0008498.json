Alex McLeish has indicated he would jump at the chance to return to Rangers. \nGraeme Murty was placed in charge of the team for Sunday's William Hill Scottish Cup fifth-round tie against Morton, but the out-of-work McLeish has emerged as the front-runner to take the Ibrox job. \nMcLeish, who won two league titles in a five-year spell as Rangers manager from 2001 to 2006 - including the domestic treble in 2003 - admitted he would find it hard to turn down the post, should it be offered. \n\"There is a lot of speculation, but at the moment there is nothing I can update you on,\" he told Sky Sports ahead of Gers' 2-1 win over Morton. Former boss Mark Warburton left Ibrox on Friday \n\"I am a Rangers man, you have to keep that in consideration, and when you get asked to come to club like this, it is a hard decision to turn that down. \n\"If they come and they want to speak to me, I can only take it from there. I need to wait and see if Rangers want to talk to me first.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:57:41.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
