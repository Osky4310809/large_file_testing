Hyperloop One calls the test track DevLoop.\n\nSo far, there's 500 meters of tubing, weighing over 1,100 tons.\nImage: Hyperloop one\nWhen the DevLoop is completed, it will form a loop in the desert, roughly 30 miles outside of Las Vegas, where HyperLoop One hopes to conduct its first full-scale test of what would be the World's first hyperloop transportation system.\nThat system was first envisioned by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in 2013. It's a ground-based transportation technology that uses vacuum-sealed tubes, maglev, frictionless propulsion technology and sealed pods inside the tubes that cruse along at just-below the speed of sound. When completed, such a transportation system could cut hours-long travel between cities down to minutes.\n\nTube work looks a little like tunnel work.\nImage: hyperloop one\nHyperloop One hopes to conduct its first DevLoop run in the first half of 2017. However, the first Hyperloop One system probably won't be in the U.S. The company signed an agreement late last year with Dubai and the United Arab Emirates to conduct a feasibility study. In January, Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd told Mashable that it's feasible that Dubai will get the first Hyperloop .\nComments Lloyd made at the Middle East Conference, according to a release provided by the company, seem to support that possibility:\n\"Tying together the Middle East region would produce greater virtual density, without congestion and pollution, spurring innovation, productivity, job growth and more powerful sharing of knowledge, labor and investment. Building a Hyperloop would vastly impact the economy and make any major city in the GCC accessible within one hour.\" \nEven as it finally makes progress, Hyperloop One faces increasing competition from Hyperloop Technologies and even a startup from their former co-founder and CTO Brogan BamBrogan. Still, Hyperloop One is the only company to successfully demonstrate any portion of a hyperloop system and this DevLoop build out in the Nevada dessert represents a significant leap forward. Soon, all the hyperloops out there may be playing catch-up.\nBONUS: Elon Musk's Hyperloop dream is closer to becoming a reality", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:18:22.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
