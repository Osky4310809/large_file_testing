Though its specification hasn’t yet been finalized, Qualcomm has already announced a pair of chips that would be compatible with the 802.11ax standard, should little change from the already announced draft 1.0 IEEE spec.\nIn a press release yesterday, Qualcomm revealed the IPQ8074 quad-core 14nm SoC for broadcasting devices like wireless routers and access points, but it’s the QCA6290 chip, intended for laptops, tablets and smartphones, which is more interesting for us.\nAs increasingly more devices are connected to Wi-Fi networks: be it in the home or public spaces like airports or coffee places, it becomes harder for the current Wi-Fi standard to serve those connected devices. Unlike past generations of the Wi-Fi standard, which focused mostly on maximum speeds, the 802.11ax standard prioritizes network capacity and the way data is transferred to multiple devices.\nMany modern Wi-Fi routers have to serve devices individually through a process called Single User Multiple Input Multiple Output, or SU-MIMO. Multiple User Multiple Input Multiple Output, or MU-MIMO, serves devices simultaneously, and will become standardized in 802.11ax. The result will be better Wi-Fi performance with multiple devices connected to the same source. (Note that MU-MIMO is already available one some routers and devices, but the functionality is not required to receive 802.11ac certification.)\nSee also: A lack of alternatives to Qualcomm is hurting the ecosystem 3 weeks ago As for Qualcomm’s chip specifically, the QCA6290 SoC is said to offer up to four times the typical throughput speed on a crowded network. The chip can also take advantage of both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands simultaneously — another intended benefit of the 802.11ax standard,— and will be less power hungry than its 802.11ac compatible chips.\nQualcomm is kind of hedging its bets by announcing the chip ahead of the finalization of the standard, but at least it shows that the company is keen to get compatible technology in the hands of consumers quickly.\nThe 802.11ax Wi-Fi standard is expected to be commercialized in 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:05:16.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
