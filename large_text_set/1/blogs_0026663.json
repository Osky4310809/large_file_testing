Photo: The White House \nDonald Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from some Islamic countries from entering the US has been met with a flood of tech companies making a record-breaking amount of donations to the American Civil Liberties Union . \nPopular ride-sharing app Lyft revealed that it will donate $1 million to the ACLU in order to help “defend our constitution.” The move inspired other top tech figures and apps to throw their support behind the organization whose mission is to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties of every person in the USA. Fighting Trump \nFormer Apple VP and Nest founder Tony Fadell announced on Twitter that he would match any of his followers’ donations to the ACLU. Fadell initially promised to spend up to $25,000 but within hours increased the amount to $100,000 due to the strong response. Triple your donation. Send your receipts to me too. I'll match to $25k. Thanks @sacca for taking the lead! https://t.co/B6TMltL2OB \n—Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 29, 2017 \nSilicon Valley investor and Shark Tank co-star Chris Sacca also promised to match contributions to the ACLU. The team behind the popular weather app DarkSky announced it will donate all proceeds from their app for the next seven days to the ACLU. \nAs a result of the outpouring of support, the ACLU says it has received more than $24 million in donations in since Saturday from least 356,306 individual donors. The amount is more than the organization received in all of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:30:34.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
