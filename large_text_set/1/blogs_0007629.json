Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHull boss Marco Silva claims beating Manchester United would be bigger than leading Olympiacos to their historic win at Arsenal. \nSilva masterminded Olympiacos’ 3-2 Champions League success at the Emirates last season - their first in England on their 13th attempt. \nBut the Portuguese feels toppling United over two legs in the EFL Cup will be tougher because of his crippling injury list and the fact he is only days into his Hull reign. \n“It’s different and I think it’s easy to find why it’s different,” said Silva. “When I went to the Emirates with Olympiacos, I’d had three or four months to work with my team. \n“I first came to Olympiacos in July and I had my roster. I prepared my team, made pre-season with my team.

When I talk to you about our problems, it’s completely different. When your colleague asked me if I have one centre-back to play, you see it’s completely different.” \nMichael Dawson injured his shoulder in Silva’s opening win over Swansea in the FA Cup to leave the Tigers without a fully-fit centre-half for Tuesday’s daunting trip to Old Trafford. Silva hopes either Dawson or Harry Maguire can recover to play and insists it is not mission impossible for his Tigers. \n“I think it’s a different challenge, but it won’t be a miracle,” he said. “I believe, and I’m sure Man United are favourites, but they should be. \n“But we will still do our best to get to they final.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:39:10.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
