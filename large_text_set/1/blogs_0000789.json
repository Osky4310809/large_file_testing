Advertisement \nBills kick returner Mike Gillislee inexplicably allowed the ball to roll into Buffalo’s end zone on a kickoff, setting up New York’s fastest and easiest touchdown of the season. \nGillislee stood over the live ball as New York’s Doug Middleton pounced on it for a 30-3 Jets lead after the PAT: \nBecause the game clock doesn’t run on a kickoff until a player touches the ball, and the previous drive ended at 3:21 with a Nick Folk field goal, the Jets technically scored 10 points in zero seconds. Advertisement \nThis is also an appropriate time to bring up a 2003 Eagles-Cowboys game.
