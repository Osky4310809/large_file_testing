I got mine on the underside of my left forearm, in my daughter's handwriting. \n\"This was my second tattoo; the first is a small, lowercase 'j' that has been on my ankle for 25 years. You can probably guess what it stands for. \n\"Jason has one too, but with more letters: 'AKR.'\" \nTowards the end of her essay, called You May Want to Marry My Husband, Amy writes: \"I am wrapping this up on Valentine's Day, and the most genuine, non-vase-oriented gift I can hope for is that the right person reads this, finds Jason, and another love story begins. \n\"I'll leave this intentional empty space below as a way of giving you two the fresh start you deserve.\" \nThere then follows a blank white space. \nShe ends: \"With all my love, Amy.\" \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T13:14:52.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
