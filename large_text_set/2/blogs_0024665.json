This basically corroborates what we’ve heard in the past about Apple doing away with the Touch ID sensor and going with something new. \nIn its patent filing, Apple talks about how an array of acoustic transducers can be placed beneath the cover glass near the display, and how they could even replace proximity sensors in the future. In its first form, these transducers will be capable of producing pulses or waves that can go past even something like an iPhone cover glass. \nIn its second operation, the transducers will be able to monitor diffractions, reflections, and attenuations to the acoustic waves that are caused when a foreign object (user’s fingers) comes in contact with the input-responsive substrate. The data developed by this is read by an onboard image resolver, which then goes on to create a two-dimensional map. \nThe map obtained from the image resolver is used to authenticate a user from the database. This is standard protocol for fingerprint sensing and could be an evolution of the Touch ID sensor envisioned by Apple with the iPhone 5s . Although it has come a long way since then, clearly, Apple sees the need to do away with the Touch ID sensor in favor of something better. \nThis advanced technology could recognize fingerprints in addition to reading other parts of the human body such as ears. This could be handy when the user rests the phone against his/her face during phone calls, thus acting as proximity sensors like we mentioned above. \nIt is hoped that Apple will use this particular technology with the iPhone 8 later this year, although nothing is set in stone at the moment. Would you like to see this particular fingerprint scanning technology with the iPhone 8?
