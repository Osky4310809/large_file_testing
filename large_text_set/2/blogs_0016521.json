File photo \n  The government will resume peace talks with communist rebels if they stop their attacks on soldiers, extortion activities and the burning of properties, Malacañang said yesterday. \nPresidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said there should be “compelling reasons” to continue the negotiations, which were terminated by President Duterte this month after the rebels staged a series of attacks against government forces. \n“While it is understandable that suspicions linger about the motives of the parties on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum, some ‘compelling reasons’ need to be provided for talks to resume,” Abella said in a statement. \n“Considering the unprecedented goodwill the President has shown, these actions from NDF (National Democratic Front) may provide compelling reason and could put at ease, to some extent, the apprehension of the military and the administration. After all, when guns are silent we can better listen to each other,” he added. \nThe NDF represents the communist rebels in the peace negotiations with the government. \nAbella said the communists should agree to a bilateral ceasefire and stop the collection of the so-called revolutionary tax, the ambushes on military personnel, the burning of properties and other provocative and hostile actions.   \n“We need to take in good faith the President’s vision for a peaceful, just and inclusively prosperous Philippines. He has already taken the first steps forward. We wait for the NDF to respond,” he said. \nThe peace negotiations between the government and the NDF were scrapped after the communists insisted on their demand to free 400 rebels whom they claim to be political prisoners. Duterte rejected the demand, saying it is similar to the grant of amnesty. \nThe disagreement prompted the communists and subsequently the government to call off their respective unilateral ceasefire orders. \nOn Feb. 4, Duterte announced that he is terminating the peace talks and ordered the security forces to arrest the NDF consultants who joined the negotiations. He has also described the NDF, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and their armed wing the New People’s Army (NPA) as “terrorists.” \nOn Sunday, the CPP ordered the NPA to free the six soldiers and policemen they are holding captive as a “positive gesture” for the resumption of the peace talks. The group also reiterated its support for a bilateral ceasefire agreement. \n“The revolutionary forces are encouraged by the previous statements of President Duterte that all political prisoners will be released within 48 hours once the bilateral ceasefire agreement is signed,” the CPP said in a statement. \n“We anticipate that negotiations concerning the terms of reference of a bilateral ceasefire agreement will be most difficult. The revolutionary forces are bound by principle to assert the withdrawal of the AFP’s operating troops from areas under the sway of the revolutionary government,” it added. \nThe disagreement over jailed communist rebels was also the contentious issue that led to the collapse of the peace talks during the previous administration. \nRelease troops \nThe military called on the NPA yesterday to release the soldiers and policemen without conditions to show the sincerity of the CPP to resume the peace talks. \n“The NPA should prove and substantiate their announcements with clear and sincere actions, not propaganda,” said Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla. \nAmong those to be freed are Pfc. Edwin Salan who was captured in Alegria, Surigao del Norte on Jan. 29; Sgt. Solaiman Calucop and Pfc. Samuel Garay who were captured in Columbio, Sultan Kudarat on Feb. 2; Police Officer 2 Jerome Natividad captured in Talakag, Bukidnon on Feb. 9; and militiamen Rene Doller and Carl Mark who were captured in Lupon, Davao Oriental on Feb. 14. \nIn its statement issued Sunday, the CPP said the release of the six “prisoners of war” is their positive gesture to continue peace negotiations with the government. \nPadilla welcomed the move by the communist rebels, whom the military earlier said had been suffering tactical defeat since the government lifted its unilateral ceasefire declaration on Feb. 4. \n“Doing so (freeing the soldiers without condition) would lessen the seriousness of their continuing crimes and add to any goodwill they wish to convey,” he said. \nPresidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza said the government would take the necessary steps for the resumption of peace talks if the CPP/ NPA/NDF rebels are willing to proceed with the negotiation for a bilateral ceasefire agreement. \n“We welcome and respect the positive position coming from the leadership of the CPP/NPA/NDF,” Dureza said in a statement yesterday. \n“On the part of the Philippine government, we share the same commitment to work for just and lasting peace in the land. When compelling reasons, as President Duterte earlier announced, are present, then we in government shall take the next necessary steps,” Dureza added. \nThe NDF also directed the NPA to work closely with third party facilitators for the release of the six captives before the scheduled peace negotiations in the Netherlands next week. \nHand of peace \nPresidential daughter Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio yesterday offered a hand of peace to the NPA to stop the spate of encounters, particularly in Davao City. \n“In light of the recent events in the third district of Davao City that resulted in the deaths of our fellow Filipinos, I am offering my hand in peace to the NPA,” Duterte-Carpio said in a statement yesterday. \n“In the event that you will decline my offer, I can only pray that there will be no more deaths and leave everything to the AFP and to God,” she added. \nThe mayor stressed that she is willing to listen to whatever the NPA rebels have to say provided they would come in group and not just as individuals. \nNDF consultant Satur Ocampo said rebel consultants should not be arrested during the one-month grace period after the government notified them about the cancellation of the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG). \nOcampo stressed that the NDF asked that its consultants be freed because they are covered by JASIG “that tells that their participation in the peace talks would guarantee them against harassment, arrest and filing of cases.” \nMeanwhile, the military said NPA rebels allegedly forced hundreds of villagers out of Barangays Cabua-an and St. Niño in Madella, Quirino province last Saturday. \n1/Lt. Rhea May Reyes, spokesperson of the Army’s 5th Infantry Division, said residents of the two barangays were terrorized by the presence of the armed men. \nMore than 100 rebels had occupied a school in nearby Barangay San Martin. \nReyes said Army troopers were ordered to secure the area to allow residents to return to their homes. – With Michael Punongbayan, Ghio Ong, Edith Regalado, Artemio Dumlao  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:30:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
