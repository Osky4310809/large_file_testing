She didn’t do well with interceptions,” Prescott said. \nDespite the fact that Prescott threw only four interceptions in 459 attempts this season, that was four too many. Prescott explained that when he was growing up his mother had no patience for turnovers. \n“I’d come home from practice and tell her I threw an interception at practice and she’d say ‘Why are we practicing that?'” \nPrescott is so determined to avoid throwing interceptions, he will not even toss a ball to a defensive player during practices. \n“Not at all.” Prescott confirmed. “Some of the guys, they try to get me sometimes, and I’ll put (the ball) on the ground and roll it to them.” \nHe practices the way he plays, and in his words tossing the ball to the defense, “that’s creating bad habits.” \nPrescott wants to keep the habit of winning alive. The Cowboys earned the top seed in the NFC playoffs with a 13-3 record. \nDallas will host their first playoff game on Sunday, January 15 at AT&T Stadium. \nWatch the full episode of Dak Prescott joining Inside the Huddle this Sunday at 9:00 a.m. on TXA 21. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
