That says to me they wanted a viral moment at any expense. And that’s not a company with integrity for 50-something years. That’s not who Dick Clark was. He loved artists.” Read more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T13:23:35.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
