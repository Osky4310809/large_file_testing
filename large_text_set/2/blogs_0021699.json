Seriously, this is a case of a restaurant employee going above and beyond the call of duty: Waitress drags out unwanted guest at restaurant The server, Samia Lila, is originally from France and got a job at the Australian winery with a work visa. The 25-year-old tells The Age : “I wasn't scared, I like reptiles so was a bit excited.\" The incident was caught on camera, and the video was posted to the winery’s Facebook page, where it has now been viewed half a million times.
