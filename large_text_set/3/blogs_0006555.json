CNET is unable to verify whether the documents are real or have been altered. Meanwhile, the CIA said it doesn't comment \"on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.\" \nThis slideshow offers a look at some of the tech WikiLeaks says is vulnerable. Google's Android mobile operating system is reportedly among the affected systems. Google declined to comment. \nWikiLeaks has a long track record of releasing top secret government documents , and experts who've started to sift through the material said it appears legitimate, according to CBS News. It's unclear, though, whether these programs are still running and whether they affect the latest versions of the hardware and software. Gallery published March 7, 2017.

Not according to WikiLeaks, which as part of its latest document dump alleges that the Apple gadget, too, is vulnerable to the CIA's spying eyes. Apple declined to comment.

(Again, Apple has declined to comment.)

WhatsApp declined to comment. Photo by: Sarah Tew/CNET \nThe CIA's global covert hacking program also allegedly turns Samsung smart TVs into secret microphones. A \"Fake-Off\" mode supposedly tricks the owner into thinking the TV is off when it's on. The television then operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a covert CIA server. Samsung didn't respond to a request for comment.

But WikiLeaks says that by hacking the phones Signal runs on, the CIA can collect audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. \n\"The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption,\" said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Signal. \"This story isn't about Signal or WhatsApp, but to the extent that it is, we see it as confirmation that what we're doing is working.\" Photo by: Getty Images \nThe Telegram app is encrypted, too, but WikiLeaks says the CIA can collect audio and message traffic before encryption takes place. \nTelegram said on its website that the problem lies with operating systems and not encrypted messaging apps and that naming specific encrypted services is \"misleading.\" Photo by: Screenshot by CNET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:54:44.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
