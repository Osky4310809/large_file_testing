Plus Usain Bolt makes an outlandish football claim and Real Madrid step up talks for a new kit deal. \nIt’s Paper Talk \nWHAT BARCELONA NIGHTMARE MEANS FOR AUSSIE FANS \nIt turns out there is a huge upside to Barcelona getting pumped by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. \nThe 4-0 loss in the first leg of their Round of 16 clash means it is almost certain that Barca will get knocked out of the competition they’ve won five times. \nNo team has ever turned around a 4-0 first leg deficit, and elimination would clear up the calendar for superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar to come Down Under for a blockbuster international friendly at the MCG. Lionel Messi and Neymar could be set to play in Australia. Source: Getty Images \nBrazil and Argentina had been announced to play in Melbourne on 9 June, with many expecting Messi and Neymar to play in the game. \nYet there had been an question mark over both, considering the Champions League final is due to take place on 3 June in Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium. \nBarcelona remaining in the UCL would have all but ruled the duo out of the post-season friendly, but their loss to PSG could be a boost to those who will be there to witness the historic game. Barca thrashed by PSG 1:55 \nUSAIN BOLT’S EXTRAORDINARY ROONEY COMPARISON \nUsain Bolt is a pretty cool cat, and after winning his fourth Laureus Award for Sportsman of the Year, the world’s fastest man again made a bold statement about his footballing ability. \n“There are so many things that I want to do, I’ve no idea where I’m going to start, I definitely want to just relax,” the 30-year-old told Laureus. \n“I’ve always wanted to try play football so that’s in the pipeline, we’ll see what happens \n“I’m going to get a chance to train at Dortmund which is good, I think I’m going to go there for a week and just to train and feel it out. \n“I’ve had people suggest different teams or ways we could get into football so we’ve been looking into those things but were not sure what’s going on yet. Bolt: 'As good as Rooney' 0:53 \n“At any level, I just want to see if I would be any good, because I play football all the time with my friends and I think I’m at a good level so if I train and actually put some work in I think I could be pretty good. \n“I’m not going to say I’m going to be the best footballer in the world, but I will be at a good level I would say, maybe at Wayne Rooney level, you know what I mean?” \nWe’re not sure if that’s a compliment to himself, or a slight on Wayne Rooney. \nEPL FEAR LOSING LEAGUE’S BEST REFEREE \nThere is a growing concern that the Premier League will lose another big star to a big money foreign move. \nExcept this time, the star is referee Mark Clattenburg. \nThat’s according to the Daily Mail, who report Clattenburg has attracted big interest from the United States, China and the Middle East and could be set to quit for a lucrative deal elsewhere. \n“If an opportunity came along – I am contracted to the Premier League – but I have to look at my long-term strategy of my career. How long can I last as a referee?” Clattenburg said in December. \n“There is no offer on the table but if they made an offer it would be under consideration.” Barca U-12's beautiful act 0:58 \nBARCA YOUTH WIN GLOBAL SPORTSMANSHIP AWARD \nIt was a bad day for Barcelona, losing 4-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, but there was one positive for their Under-12 team. \nBarcelona’s junior team scooped a Laureus Award for the Sporting Moment of the Year – awarded for their sportsmanship shown towards distraught rivals Omiya Ardija after winning 1-0 in a Junior Soccer World Challenge match in Japan. \nREAL MADRID IN TALKS FOR HUGE NEW KIT DEAL \nSpanish giants Real Madrid are in talks with American sportswear company Under Armour for a record-breaking €150million-per-year deal, according to a report from Marca. \nReal are currently kitted out by German company Adidas, who have sponsored them since 1998. Real’s contract with Adidas runs until 2020 but that hasn’t stopped Under Armour starting to get the ball rolling as they look to work their way into the football market – having reached a deal with Tottenham Hotspur in 2011 to break into the English Premier League.
