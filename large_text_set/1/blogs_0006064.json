From the moment you meet someone, it takes so much courage to express how you feel about them knowing that in all probability you might face rejection.\n(Representative image)\nThe oldest and simplest route is to “find out through mutual friends”, or perhaps to be friends with the person and drop hints and gauge body language. Whatever the methods used, rejection is never easy to handle.\nNot just because it’s a lonely one-way street, or because your fantasies and dreams are dashed, but also because it becomes about self-worth. You wonder what’s not valuable about you. Which then leads you to assume a) you’re unlovable. B) you’re not up to standards c) there’s something wrong with you. But you need to rethink, because rejection isn’t about you, it’s about a mismatch. You know how wonderful you are, so if they are blind to it, that doesn’t make you any less amazing. If what you represent isn’t appealing to them, it doesn’t take away from your good qualities.\nA random example is grilled chicken vs butter chicken on a menu. The grilled chicken isn’t more desirable because it’s the healthier option. Some people just love a juicy butter chicken and find the grilled version boring. Neither of the dishes need to feel rejected. It’s just personal taste, and there’s always a taker for both. Unlike dishes, we are human beings, so it’s natural to hurt that our “feelings” are not being reciprocated. But wouldn’t you rather wait for the right person rather than moping over someone not in sync in with you?\nElegantly handling the awkwardness of rejection is a skill people need to master. Whether a “rejecter” or “rejectee”, the cheesy, “it’s not you, it’s me” line, though utterly true, is way too patronising. The best way is to back off slowly and let the other person understand, and if pushed for answers be gentle and honest about what you want and what you feel is missing. This gives the rejectee the opportunity to assess whether it’s a facet they would like to add to their personality or the relationship, else, it gives them the understanding as to why the glove didn’t fit. The end result should always be a revelation in what you have chosen, either to be, or not to be, and not to hate the other for wanting what they want.\nI know this man through common friends and often bump into each other at parties. It’s been a few years that we chat on and off but of late we had a moment at a party and we both avoided talking about it. After a week he confessed his liking towards me and I avoided reacting, not to complicate things. But there after he is quite detached and now I’m thinking about him too much. I don’t know if it really means something or it’s just me.\nYou decided to not complicate things so he backed away. Either he is dealing with rejection his own way, or he is being sensible and doesn’t want to “inflict” himself on you. Either way, the ball is clearly in your court. You can either send feelers through messages and body language or simply be direct. What’s the worst that can happen? That he will reject you the way you did to him? That’s only fair!\nMy girlfriend and I have been in a steady relationship for over 3 years now. It has been a long distance relationship and she just returned back from the States and we’ve started living in, since then we have only been fighting. Also we have changed and cannot put up with each other. But there is some sort of attachment that stops us from parting ways every time.\nA long distance relationship only brings out the best sides that you put forward over social media and other forms of communication. All the fleeting time you do manage to spend together is full of the good stuff. Daily life, and getting to know a person ‘warts and all’, is what sinks in when you live together. What was built was a fantasy. This is reality. Attachment is normal and will fade once you both move apart and find other partners.\nMy friend and I liked the same guy, however it was only a few days back that he proposed to me. Now I’m guilty and really bad for my friend; I’m not even sure if I should tell her about it – in case she feels ditched. I don’t know what to do. Please advise.\nBoth of you knew you liked the same guy, so that wasn’t a secret, and it’s definitely not the kind of thing you can keep secret once you start seeing each other. Also, how can she feel ditched when he was never with her in the first place? If you feel the friendship will be affected, then you need to make a clear cut decision as to who matters more and let her know of the same.\nI’ve been friendly with this guy since quite a few months now and he kept giving me hints about his feelings. Recently, I also developed the same feelings for him and decided to tell him about it. However, it turned out to be a major embarrassment as he was very casual about it and advised me not to think so much. What does this mean?\nIt could mean that either you misread him or that he has changed his mind. Either way, make light of it and keep the friendship alive. In addition, focus on others so he knows it didn’t impact you or the friendship and simply move on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:07:13.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
