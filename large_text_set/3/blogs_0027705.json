The 5-foot-8 flamethrower showed why he’s the Blue Jays’ No. 1 starter from the opening pitch, locating all of his deliveries with the precision of an artist. His power sinkers darted across the corners of the paint, while his late-breaking slider made others look downright silly as he picked up three strikeouts. He allowed just two baserunners, a leadoff walk to Carlos Beltran in the second inning, and a leadoff double by Angel Pagan in the seventh.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. offense had no such problems.\nYour browser does not support iframes. After falling prey to Mets right-hander Seth Lugo’s sharp-breaking curveball through the first few innings — he racked up seven strikeouts — they adjusted. Kinsler, who spoke out against the energetic play of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic on Tuesday, let his bat do the talking in the final, blasting a two-run homer in the third inning and jump-starting a rally in the fifth.\nThe Tigers’ second baseman opened the frame with a line-drive single to left before Christian Yelich and Andrew McCutchen each followed with run-scoring singles to give the U.S. breathing room.\nTwo innings later, they blew the game wide open.\nBrandon Crawford lined a two-run single into shallow right, and Giancarlo Stanton added an RBI single off of Jose Berrios to end any threat of the tension and late-game drama that has engulfed the tournament over the past few weeks.\nWhen the final out was recorded, catcher Jonathan Lucroy leapt out of his crouch, closer David Robertson pumped his fists in the air, and a dog pile formed in the middle of the diamond with Stroman in the middle of it.\nJust the way Stroman imagined it.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T07:18:29.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
