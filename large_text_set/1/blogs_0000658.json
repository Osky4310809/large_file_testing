By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 04/01/2017 \nActivision has removed Platinum's Turtles game from Steam, PlayStation Network and the Xbox Games Store. Turtles is unavailable to buy from the Xbox Games Store, among other digital platforms. \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan, developed by action game specialist Platinum and published by Activision, went on sale under a year ago, in May 2016. \nAnd so the delisting comes as some surprise for a game that's been available to download for just under eight months. \nIt appears Activision's on something of a licensed game purge. People have noticed The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel have been removed from digital stores, too. \nWhile these games have been snuffed out of existence online, you can always pick up a physical copy.
