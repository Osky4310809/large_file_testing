Now that some time has passed and Flash has a bit more experience, some have wondered if the result would be different this time around. \nFans had a chance to ask Arrow stars Stephen Amell and David Ramsey a few questions during a Wizard World Q&A, including if Flash would win a fight with Arrow now that he's had some time to get more used to his powers. Ramsey jumped at the chance to answer. \n\"That is a great question. I'm going to handle that one boo boo. I think Arrow would still win. I just think experience trumps power, right. I think Oliver Queen would find a way like Bruce Wayne to beat all the superpowered guys. Oliver Queen kind of deals with this kind of criminal aspect, this dark side of himself a lot like Bruce Wayne, and I just think that is what gives him the edge, and Barry Allen just doesn't have that.\" \nBatman has always plotted a few steps ahead of everyone, even his teammates much to their chagrin, and Oliver does have those same tendencies. Still, there are those who might think speed trumps experience, so both sides have a winnable argument. \nYou can watch the full panel above. \nThe official description for the Arrow midseason premiere can be found below. \nOLIVER WANTS JUSTICE; FELICITY WANTS REVENGE — Worried that Prometheus is right and he is truly a killer at heart, Oliver (Stephen Amell) looks for any ray of hope and finds it in what seems to be the miraculous return of Laurel Lance (guest star Katie Cassidy). \nHowever, Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards), still reeling from Detective Malone’s murder, is bent on revenge – she wants to stop Prometheus at any cost. While in prison, Diggle (David Ramsey) fights for his life. \nGregory Smith directed the episode written by Ben Sokolowski & Brian Ford Sullivan. \nArrow airs Wednesday nights at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW . \"Who Are You?\" debuts on January 25, 2017.
