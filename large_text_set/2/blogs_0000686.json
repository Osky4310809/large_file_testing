He wanted to rule from Vanga in the south to Kiunga in the north so that all the five governors can be under him. I said no because I am a governor like him elected by the people of Kwale, just like he was elected by the people of Mombasa,” he said. \nKWALE MINERALS \nHe claimed that Mr Joho wanted to get a share of the Kwale mineral resources and get tenders for various supplies. \nThe governor said that it was unfortunate that Mr Joho tried to interfere with the affairs of Kwale County when he did not come from there. \n“Governor Joho is a person of propaganda and empty talk but the people of Kwale need projects of development,” he said. \nHis deputy, Ms Achani, claimed that Mr Joho, through ODM leaders in Kwale, started a malicious campaign to discredit Mr Mvurya’s administration and good track record by inciting residents bordering the mining areas that they would be evicted after a mining license for Base Titanium was renewed. \n“He claimed that Governor Mvurya had allowed the renewal of the license when in actual sense, the renewal of the license which was issued in 1995 was blocked by Mr Mvurya who was taken to court for that,” she said. \nShe said that for the niobium minerals mined by Cortec Mining Kenya Ltd, Mr Joho also tried to interfere because he wanted some stake in the multi-billion project. \n“But Governor Mvurya again blocked their schemes. That was the start of differences between Mvurya and the Mombasa governor,” she said. \nThe two leaders assured residents that they will not be evicted from their farms unless they sold their land willingly to the mining companies. \nSTOP TRIBALISM \nMr Mvurya urged his opponents in the governor’s race to stop preaching hatred by diving the residents on tribal or ethnic lines. \n“If you claim that this is a Duruma, a Digo, a Kamba or this and that tribe, you are not being a leader because Kwale County has all tribes. Politics of tribalism is old fashioned and no development will come from such leadership,” he said. \nHe said his opponents had been in government for many years without bringing any tangible development but for four years “we have managed to bring major transformation that everyone can see”. \nHe said the 100 per cent scholarship programme was the only one of its kind in the 47 counties and pledged to work towards better education and health. \n“We made a pledge during our campaigns in 2013 that we would pay fees for all students from Kwale who joined national schools. We have fulfilled that pledge,” Mr Mvurya said. \nHe cautioned those seeking to unseat him in August elections that leadership “is not the same as being co-wives” but a serious commitment to change the lives of the residents. \n“Ugavana sio uke wenza. Hii ni kazi muhimu ya maana ambayo haitimizwi kwa mtu kuwa kabila hii ama kabila ile.” (Being the governor is not like being co-wives. This is a serious commitment that is not achieved because one comes from this tribe or the other,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:05:12.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
