Some communities in this zone could be hit by nearly every round of severe thunderstorms. \nThe extent of the severe weather and the risk of tornadoes will be assessed ahead of each event. \nFollowing a severe weather outbreak that spans late Thursday to Saturday , the next storm will likely trigger a new round of severe weather with the possibility of a few tornadoes from parts of central and northeastern Texas to portions of eastern Kansas and western Missouri beginning on Sunday. \nYet another round of severe weather may be spawned over the central and southern Plains from the middle to latter part of next week. \nPeople with outdoor plans or traveling through the South Central states into April will want to monitor the forecast for changes in timing of the storms and severe weather bulletins once severe weather is imminent. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:37:08.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
