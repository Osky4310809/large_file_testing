This winner winner chicken dinner is nominated alongside dramatic fare like Fences , Hidden Figures , and Nocturnal Animals , and fellow genre underdog Arrival .\nThe nomination isn’t entirely shocking. The Writer’s Guild previously nominated other superhero movies ( The Dark Knight and Guardians Of The Galaxy ), although Deadpool is certainly a rare R-rated genre pick. Maybe they were swayed by Deadpool ‘s Academy Awards “for your consideration” campaign…\nOnly a few hours left for Oscar voting. Too late for a write-in campaign for an ineligible movie? pic.twitter.com/kR4nrRrULv \n— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) February 23, 2016 \n\n\nOr maybe they’re hoping now six-time Academy Award viewer Ryan Reynolds will film a personalized thank you video as he did for Deadpool ‘s Clio Award nomination . Or maybe they’re just impressed that the film broke eleven box office records — including highest grossing R-rated movie and largest R-rated opening weekend — all on a budget of only about $58 million .\nHere are the other nominees:\nBest Original Screenplay \nHell Or High Water , Taylor Sheridan La La Land , Damien Chazelle Loving , Jeff Nichols Manchester By The Sea , Kenneth Lonergan Moonlight , Barry Jenkins Best Adapted Screenplay \nArrival , Eric Heisserer Deadpool , Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick Fences , August Wilson Hidden Figures , Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi Nocturnal Animals , Tom Ford The winners will be announced on February 19th. Whether Deadpool wins or not ( it won’t ), we can guess how they’re reacting to the nomination.\nFOX\n(Via Comics Alliance and the Los Angeles Times )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:02:30.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
