Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals. \nThe Hebrew prophets prepared the way for the coming of Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, who should provide salvation for all mankind who believe in the gospel. \nConsistent with these truths, we believe that God has given and will give to all peoples sufficient knowledge to help them on their way to eternal salvation, either in this life or in the life to come. \nWe also declare that the gospel of Jesus Christ, restored to His Church in our day, provides the only way to a mortal life of happiness and a fulness of joy forever. For those who have not received this gospel, the opportunity will come to them in the life hereafter if not in this life. \nOur message therefore is one of special love and concern for the eternal welfare of all men and women, regardless of religious belief, race, or nationality, knowing that we are truly brothers and sisters because we are sons and daughters of the same Eternal Father.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:27:33.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
