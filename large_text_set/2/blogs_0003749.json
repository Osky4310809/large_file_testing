Now the device has leaked once again in a bunch of renders from casemaker Ringke. The newly leaked photos reveal a design similar to the one in the previously leaked photos. \nThe Ringke case renders reveal that the LG G6 will sport dual cameras at the rear with a dual-LED flash. The phone will get a fingerprint sensor that’s located right below the cameras. It will come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and a USB Type-C port. The handset will not feature any physical buttons on the front, and will rely on on-screen navigation buttons. \nThe LG G6 is expected to go official at the company’s pre-MWC event on February 26th. We will be at the floor in Barcelona to bring you all the official details regarding the phone’s price, specs and availability, so stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:27:28.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
