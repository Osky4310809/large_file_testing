Credit Complex Networks “Embed, what’s that?” asks a scantily clad woman who finds herself in a Des Moines hotel bed with a pair of handcuffs tied to its posts, cigarettes and a 19-year-old who happens to be a governor’s daughter. So begins the sitcom “Embeds,” which debuts Wednesday on G o90 , Verizon’s new mobile streaming service aimed at millennials. The young woman in a state of dishabille soon gets her answer. “News organizations assign reporters to be embedded with presidential candidates,” answers one of the aforementioned species, a character named Noah. He is putting on his clothes after flawlessly executing the classic television trick of waking up in horror after a drunken night of debauchery and flinging off the sheets. Life on the campaign trail. Sort of. I spent a year and a half embedded with Donald J. Trump’s campaign for CBS, following him full time from start to victorious finish. For me and the other roughly 40 embeds all sent by major networks to cover the campaign, our jobs were simple: Write pieces. Shoot pieces. Edit pieces. Do radio interviews. Be on television. Be the first to read everything. Be the first to watch everything. Actually, be the first to report everything.   Scott Conroy, the creator of “Embeds,” does an admirable job of accurately portraying the embed life, the ménage à trois aside. He was one himself, in 2008 for CBS, covering Gov. Mitt Romney and that year’s Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, which is why his show is as much a love letter to campaign reporters as it is a sendup. He wrote the pilot with a fellow embed, Peter Hamby, who is now head of news at Snapchat. \nAdvertisement   “Embeds” focuses on five 20-somethings — Noah (Taylor Zakhar), Marissa (Kelsey Asbille), T. J. (Andre Jamal Kinney), Quinn (Max Ehrich) and Syd (Chloe Brooks) — who work at competing television networks and travel full time to cover the primary campaign of the show’s fictional governor of Rhode Island, John Dobson (Don Tieri). (According to Noah, Dobson has “the personal touch of a porcupine.”) While the show is a purposeful caricature of reporters — it’s a sitcom, after all — “Embeds” does capture the bonds that develop among a small group of competitors, the loneliness of the campaign trail and the craziness of political journalism in the digital age. After viewing all six episodes, I offer a few facts of the embed’s life that the show gets right and those it gets wrong. Or, in the words of the campaign trail, ones I used every day in notes to the network, “confirmed” and “unconfirmed.” THE GEAR: CONFIRMED Embeds carry around an inhuman amount of … stuff: tripod, camera, microphones, computer, batteries, giant suitcase and, perhaps most important, giant chips on their shoulders. On any given day, I was responsible for lugging 90 pounds of gear all over the country. My back is still feeling the effects.

Credit Complex Networks CAMPAIGN BUS INTIMACY : UNCONFIRMED In one of the later episodes, “Things Get Hairy,” two embeds wake up naked on the Dobson campaign bus after a night turned romantic, only to be discovered by a veteran reporter. Romances certainly did blossom on the campaign trail, but all the embeds I know bent over backward to keep their flings secret, for fear of compromising their professional standing. One embed couple refused to admit for weeks, if not months, that they had struck up a romance, even though it was fairly obvious to anyone on the road with them. VULGAR RANTS BY CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS : CONFIRMED Brynn (Carrie-Lynn Neales), Dobson’s campaign staffer, constantly curses out the embeds and threatens retribution for reporting she didn’t like. In the second episode, she objects to Quinn including the governor’s daughter in his live shot without clearing it with her. As retaliation, she excludes him from an off-the-record dinner with Dobson. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
