(AP) â€” The San Francisco 49ers have hired former NFL safety and Fox broadcaster John Lynch to be their general manager.\nAfter a lengthy search that included interviews with nine other publicly identified candidates, team CEO Jed York settled on a mystery candidate when he gave the job to Lynch on Sunday. ESPN first reported the deal, saying Lynch had gotten a six-year contract.\nAfter playing for former Niners coach Bill Walsh in college at Stanford, Lynch went on to have a stellar 15-year career with Tampa Bay and Denver that included three All-Pro selections and one Super Bowl title with the Buccaneers. He's a finalist this year for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nSince retiring in 2008, Lynch has been an analyst at Fox.\n___\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nMore from Associated Press: Rescuers search collapsed buildings in Italy after another powerful earthquake hits region near Perugia Texas Longhorns jump all the way up to No. 11 in latest AP poll after beating Notre Dame A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university's president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure Craig Sager is hoping to return to NBA sidelines by November after receiving a rare third bone-marrow transplant David Ortiz honored with a corn maze cut in his likeness SEE ALSO: The 30 highest-paid tennis players of all time More: Associated Press John Lynch San Francisco 49ers", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"], "published": "2017-01-30T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T04:49:40.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
