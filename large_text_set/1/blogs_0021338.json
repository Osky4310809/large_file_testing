(Getty Images) \nHow much is your degree worth? What’s the connection between your degree and your future earnings? \nMost college students want to know the answers to these questions. And they’re probably most pressing for students of limited means. Does a college education actually improve outcomes for lower-income students? And if so, by how much? \nWe’re starting to get a better sense of the answers to these questions. And there’s some good news here: According to a report issued by the not-for-profit Equality of Opportunity Project, low-income students who graduate from middle-tier public colleges see income growth rates comparable to students who graduate from top-tier private institutions. \nMost top-tier schools skew heavily toward higher-income students. Elite Ivy League universities and the so-called “baby Ivies” do — no big surprise — tend to produce the most successful graduates. And the report found that these schools educated comparatively small percentages of students from low-income families. Moreover, students who came from families in the top percentile of earners were nearly 80 times more likely to attend elite private institutions than students from families in the bottom fifth. Related: As college costs skyrocket, more students try crowdfunding \nTo determine which colleges best help low-income Americans rise out of poverty, the report’s authors created a new metric: the mobility rate . The mobility rate is the percentage of students who come from families in the bottom fifth of earners and reach the top fifth post-graduation. As the report explains: \n“Each college’s mobility rate is the product of the fraction of its students who come from families in the bottom fifth, and its success rate , the fraction of such students who reach the top fifth. The colleges that have the highest upward mobility rates are typically mid-tier public schools that have both large numbers of low-income students and very good outcomes.” \nTake Princeton, for example:– 65 percent of students reached the top fifth of earners post graduation.– Yet only 2 percent of students at Princeton came from families in the bottom fifth of earners.– So, Princeton has a mobility rate of just 1.3 percent. \nIn contrast, at Stony Brook, a state university in New York, where about 16 percent of students came from low-income households, more than half of all students reached the top fifth of earners. Stony Brook has a mobility rate of 8.4 percent.

On top of that, access to elite private schools for low-income students stagnated from 1999-2013. The report’s authors concluded that “the colleges that may have offered many low-income students pathways to success are becoming less accessible to them.” Related: 42% of UC students suffer from hunger. Help is on the way \nRelying on individual financial records of about 30 million students and their families, the report’s authors suggest policymakers use it as a supplement for the U.S. Education Department’s College Scorecard database. Two weeks ago, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the Excelsior Scholarship, which would give individuals and families earning annual incomes up to $125,000 free tuition at state schools. \nThis mobility report was authored by several prominent economists who focus on income inequality, including Raj Chetty, John Friedman, Emmanuel Saez, Nicholas Turner and Danny Yagan. Their central motivation is to revive “the American Dream” and help low-income families rise out of poverty.
