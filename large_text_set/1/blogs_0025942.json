Ezra Balagtey, spokesperson of the Eastern Mindanao Command (EMC), said the 15-minute attack on the detachment of a peace and development team (PDT) in Barangay (Village) Mat-i, Surigao City on Monday was followed by three more attacks against army outposts in the villages of San Isidro, Mahayahay and Hinambangan in Kitcharao town, Agusan del Norte. ADVERTISEMENT \nRebels also attacked an army outpost and burned a passenger van in Sarangani province on Monday, while a soldier, identified as Pfc. Erwin Salan, assigned with the Army’s 30th Infantry Battalion, was abducted while in the company of several civilians in Alegria, Surigao del Norte last Sunday, Balagtey said. \nBalagtey said the incidents “ran contrary to the spirit of the peace process.” \nREAD: AFP to NPA: Show sincerity in peace talks \n“These PDTs are stationed in depressed communities to facilitate the delivery of basic government services in collaboration with different government agencies,” Balagtey said. \nLt. General Rey Leonardo Guerrero, Eastmincom, condemned the attacks and called on the rebels to rein in their fighters. \n“These tactical offensives by the NPAs are inconsistent with their ceasefire declaration and could imperil peace negotiations. We call on the (Communist Party of the Philippines) to show sincerity in the peace talks with the government by directing their armed members to immediately desist from committing atrocities,” Guerrero said, adding the military would remain on alert while observing the suspension of offensive military operations (SOMO) as part of its unilateral ceasefire. \nCapt. Rhyan Batchar, spokesperson of the Army’s 10th Infantry Division, said 10 gunmen on three motorcycles also arrived at the compound of Musahamat Farms in Barangay Union in Monkayo, Compostela Valley around 7:40 p.m. on Monday, held the guards at gunpoint, and carted away a shotgun and a cal. 38 revolver – as well as cellphones and keys to several heavy equipment. /rga", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T09:52:49.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
