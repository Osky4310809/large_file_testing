Families on tight budgets are feeling the pinch of a rental market that is struggling to keep up with demand,” Housing Minister Chris Ballard said Thursday. “That’s why my staff are already developing a plan to address unfair rises in rental costs by delivering substantive rent control reform in Ontario as part of an ongoing review of the Residential Tenancies Act.”\nHe’s not quite ready with the details yet, but he apparently felt he had to answer a challenge from Toronto New Democrat MPP Peter Tabuns, who showed off a bill Thursday morning he plans to introduce next week. It would “provide rent-hike protection for all renters by immediately closing a loophole that allows landlords in buildings built later than 1991 to hike rents as much as they want,” Tabuns said.\nThat is what the rent-control language in the province’s Residential Tenancies Act says, but it’s not a loophole. Gradually phasing out rent control was the point.\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Eduardo Lima/File Ontario Housing Minister Chris Ballard Ontario instituted rent controls in 1975 and tightened them repeatedly for 20 years. According to stats from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., the federal agency that monitors the housing market, most of Ontario’s rental housing was built in the 1960s and ’70s. In the 1980s, rental construction fell off a cliff. Ottawa actually lost thousands of apartments in the 1990s.\nThen the Progressive Conservatives deregulated rents on new places and allowed rents on ones built before 1991 to increase at an inflation-based rate the government sets each year. When a rent-controlled unit changes tenants, the landlord can set a new baseline rent freely.\nRental construction now is nothing like it was during the 1960s boom, but at least new apartments now take the places of old ones that went off the market. Ottawa’s vacancy rate for purpose-built apartments dipped to 0.2 per cent in the early 2000s, a ridiculously low number. Now it’s three per cent, which is healthy.\nPlus the condo market in bigger cities has gone nuts, and not just the buy-a-condo-to-live-in-it market. Condos are where the real growth in rental units has been in the last 15 or 20 years: single places rented out as one-offs.\nTen years ago, Ottawa had about 3,700 rental condos, according to the CMHC. Now we have 9,600. A big increase in relative terms but not really in the raw numbers.\nToronto had 40,700 rental condos in 2007. Now it has 116,700. That’s huge, accounting for substantially all the rental growth there in the last decade. Almost all of them in newer buildings without rent control.\nEven so, Toronto’s vacancy rate in those places was one per cent as of last October, down from 1.8 per cent a year before. Developers and buyers can’t get those condos onto the rental market fast enough to keep up with demand. The result: high rents. A year ago, cauliflower was $8 a bundle because of a bad growing season. Different product, same forces.\nThe thing is, according to the CMHC, average rents in Toronto haven’t increased all that much overall. An average two-bedroom went for $1,327 a month in the Toronto metropolitan area, which is up $40 a month from the year before. (In Ottawa, the average two-bedroom is $1,201.) In condo rentals specifically, two-bedrooms are $2,029, which was up $80 between 2015 and 2016, and probably rising faster now.\nSo super-high rents are a localized problem, in newer condo units in the downtown core of a big city.\nRelated Ontario’s soaring hydro bills have some residents begging churches to help them pay Kevin Libin: Kathleen Wynne’s sleazy, desperate hydro ploy to fool Ontarians is, well, brilliant Ontario cuts hydro bills by 17%, but ultimately it will cost ratepayers $1.4 billion a year more Does it suck to get priced out of your place and have to move somewhere smaller or farther away or otherwise less desirable? Yes. Your home isn’t a cauliflower. Moving is a life-changing upheaval. What sucks worse is not having a place to rent at all because the government has ruined the economics of landlording.\nPrivate member’s bills like Tabuns’s rarely get anywhere, and certainly not when they compete with the governing party’s plans. Ballard has said in the past that the 1991 “exemption” has problems but is still necessary — and yet he promises “transformative” reforms so that everybody can have a place they can afford. That’s a really big promise for the government to make.\nAn election is visible off in the distance, though, and the Liberals seem to have decided that “fairness” is the mantra that will get them another term. They need votes in Toronto and its suburbs to hold on.\nSo electricity prices are coming down, even if we have to pay more later. Road tolls are a no-no, even if we can’t afford transit as a result. Ticket scalpers are on notice, even if it’s not obvious why that’s the government’s business at all. And the government is going to make your rent affordable. We’ll see soon whether they, unlike any other government that’s tried it, can find a way to do it without destroying the rental market for everyone.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T12:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T07:11:17.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
