Trump is facing legal challenges over his order imposing temporary restrictions on those entering the U.S. from seven Muslim majority countries, and curtailing funding for \"sanctuary cities.\" \nRelated: Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump Immigration Order \nTrump's orders have targeted a range of issues, from immigration to economics to health care to oil production. But in terms of volume, his executive orders aren't all that extraordinary. \nAnd he's signing them at a pace that isn't much different from that of President Barack Obama, who was also accused by critics of overstepping his authority. Phil McCausland \nThe uproar that follows executive orders typically reflects the country's divisive politics, Griffin said. \n\"A lot of this angst over executive orders is displaced angst over Trump getting elected,\" he said. \nHe added: \"People underestimate just how much discretionary power the Constitution gives the president.\" \nEvery president since George Washington has exercised his power to issue executive orders, which are published in the Federal Register and create new policies or direct agencies to act in a certain way. Orders are one of three types of executive actions, the other two being memos and proclamations, which generally carry less weight. \n\"They happen all the time, and it's the unusual cases that get a lot of notoriety,\" said Michael Gerhardt, the National Constitution Center's scholar-in-residence. \"Executive orders are often mundane and routine, but are sometimes quite dramatic.\" \nRelated: Trump Named in More Than 50 Lawsuits Since Inauguration \nThe most famous executive orders include Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, Franklin D. Roosevelt's creation of Japanese internment camps, Harry Truman's desegregation of the armed forces and Dwight Eisenhower's use of the Arkansas National Guard to enforce integration of Little Rock schools. \nRoosevelt holds the record for executive orders, with 3,728 over a period that covered the Great Depression and World War II, according to the National Constitution Center . By comparison, Obama issued 277, and George W. Bush issued 291 and Bill Clinton issued 364.
