Today, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that is what the GOP intends to do. Ryan gave a press conference Thursday during which he was asked “how and when” the GOP would pass legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. He replied, “Planned Parenthood legislation would be in our reconciliation bill.” Ryan was referring to a bill which the GOP will use to repeal Obamacare.\nLater in the press conference Ryan clarified that the repeal of Obamacare would definitely take place in 2017, though when the changes will take effect is still an open question. “The legislation will occur this year,” he said. “What date all of this gets phased in on is something we do not now know because we’re waiting for the Trump administration to be stood up,” Ryan added.\nPlanned Parenthood supporters immediately denounced the GOP plan. From CNN :\n“This is a priority for the Republicans,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Thursday afternoon. “So I just would like to speak individually to women across America: this is about respect for you, for your judgment about your personal decisions in terms of your reproductive needs, the size and timing of your family or the rest, not to be determined by the insurance company or by the Republican ideological right-wing caucus in the House of Representatives. So this is a very important occasion where we’re pointing out very specifically what repeal of the (Affordable Care Act) will mean to woman.”\nPlanned Parenthood blamed the decision on Vice President-elect Mike Pence:\nIt’s no surprise that the day after VP-Elect Pence met with the congressional leadership that @SpeakerRyan announced this. #IStandWithPP \n— Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 5, 2017 \n\nCecile Richards also suggested it wasn’t a coincidence and within the past hour encouraged her followers on Twitter to call his office:\nQuite the coincidence. https://t.co/bcHOFSS470 \n— Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) January 5, 2017 \n\nGlad you asked!
