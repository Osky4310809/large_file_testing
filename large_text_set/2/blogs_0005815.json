I did not think I was going to be happy this morning,” a fan said. \nAfter an emotional roller coaster of a game Sunday night, Pats fans are waking up happy. \n“Classic Pats. It was high drama, high energy, another historic victory, so go Pats!” another fan exclaimed. \nSome fans are still shaking off the shock. \n“Unreal. I still can’t believe it. I had to check this morning to make sure it wasn’t a dream,” a fan said. \nThousands rushed the streets after the big win. But the real celebration kicks off Tuesday, when the players and the fans get to relive the parade from two years ago. A welcome home rally with a fifth Lombardi Trophy on display. \n“I can’t wait for the parade,” a fan told WBZ. \n“I’ll be watching. I’m excited,” another fan said.

It’s gonna be a party in the streets of Boston. Hope to see you there,” Pats safety Duron Harmon said. \nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh is inviting everyone to the parade, suggesting they take public transportation and keep the backpacks at home. \n“Come in and enjoy yourselves, but also act responsibly. There’s going to be people coming in, just trying to sit on the sidewalks watching the parade to get a glimpse of the Patriots and the Super Bowl trophy,” Walsh told WBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Carl Stevens. \nSunday night, thousands took to the streets of Boston to celebrate right after the Patriots’ Super Bowl win. Boston Police report that it was a relatively quiet night. \n“We’re asking people just to be respectful out there. Last night, we had a celebration in our city. We didn’t have one arrest. Everyone peacefully celebrated and we’re asking for the same thing tomorrow during the parade,” Mayor Walsh added. \nWBZ-TV & CBSBoston.com will have live coverage of the parade starting at 10 a.m. on Tuesday. \nAfter the parade in Boston, the Kraft family and some members of the team will head to Providence for a rally at the Dunkin Donuts Center. The free rally begins at 4 p.m. WBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Carl Stevens reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:09:18.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
