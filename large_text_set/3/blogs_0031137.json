Chara sent a shot Segee’s way, and he stopped it, but it was what he stopped the shot with that really hurt. A post shared by Joe Haggerty (@hackswithhaggs) on Mar 29, 2017 at 9:44am PDT \nIn case you’re unaware of just how mean Chara’s slap shot is, he’s a five-time winner of the league’s hardest shot competition. In fact, the Slovak defenseman set the record at a whopping 108.8 mph in 2012. \nAnd if Segee didn’t know that before taking a puck straight to the groin, he certainly does now. \nThumbnail photo via Sergei Belski/USA TODAY Sports Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T06:12:14.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
