The app makes little effort to help new users understand its appeal (a built-in user guide is buried deep within the app). But that did not stop 158m people from using Snapchat every day by the end of 2016, up 48% on the previous year. Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, starts trading as a public company today, March 2nd, at an expected valuation of more than $20bn. To mark the most anticipated tech-industry flotation since Alibaba’s in 2014, The Economist explains how the confounding service actually works. Snapchat is best known as an app used by teenagers to send pictures, or “snaps”, that self-destruct a few seconds after being seen. Unlike on Facebook its users do not leave behind a digital trail of embarrassing pictures. But in the past two years it has added several other features, including a chat function, filters that overlay graphics on photos, a “stories” function that allows users to document their days and, not least, a place for media companies (including The Economist ) to publish journalism and entertainment content. Yet finding all these features can be a challenge. Fortunately, Snap’s IPO prospectus contains a detailed guide to using the app, complete with diagrams (see picture). “Making a snap is simple,” according to the prospectus . “Users either tap the camera button to take a photo, or hold the camera button to record a video up to ten seconds long. Immediately after a snap has been created on the camera screen, the preview screen displays the photo or video snap for the user to review and edit using our creative tools.” These allow users to decorate their images with text, doodles or pre-installed goodies such as stickers, personalised emoji and video effects. More than 60% of the 2.5bn snaps created everyday employ these tools. With your snap ready to go, hit the right arrow to send it to a friend. The detailed instructions in Snapchat’s prospectus are not just for older users. Demand for shares is brisk but a capital structure that deprives new investors of voting rights, combined with investors’ limited understanding of what the company does or why, could dampen enthusiasm if its first few quarters are bumpy. In that way, if not any other, Snapchat resembles Facebook, which struggled to boost its stock price in its first year after listing. At the social-networking giant’s first shareholder meeting in 2013, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, faced questions about privacy settings, an unfriendly mobile app and the lack of a helpline for users. One woman explained that she bought 8,000 shares on her son’s advice despite not knowing how to use Facebook. If Evan Spiegel, Snapchat’s CEO, wants to avoid a similar drilling when he confronts shareholders, it is in his and the company’s best interests to issue ever more, and simpler, how-to guides.
