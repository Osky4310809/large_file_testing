He had an unusual flair for fashion, wearing wild-looking clothing made of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He lived in the desert wilderness, ate locust and wild honey and preached a strange message. Unlike so many people, John the Baptist knew his mission in life. He clearly understood that he had been set apart by God for a purpose. \nThrough God's direction, John the Baptist challenged the people to prepare for the coming of the Messiah by turning away from sin and being baptized as a symbol of repentance . Although he held no power or influence in the Jewish political system, he delivered his message with the force of authority. People could not resist the overpowering truth of his words, as they flocked by the hundreds to hear him and be baptized. And even as he attracted the attention of the crowds, he never lost sight of his missionâ€”to point people to Christ. John the Baptist's Accomplishments \nJohn's mother, Elizabeth , was a relative of Mary , the mother of Jesus. The two women were pregnant at the same time. The Bible says in Luke 1:41, when the two expectant mothers met, the baby leaped within Elizabeth's womb as she was filled with the Holy Spirit . The angel Gabriel had already foretold the miraculous birth and prophetic ministry of John the Baptist to his father Zechariah. The news was a joyous answer to prayer for the previously barren Elizabeth. John was to become the God-ordained messenger proclaiming the arrival of the Messiah, Jesus Christ . \nThe remarkable ministry of John the Baptist included the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River . John did not lack boldness as he challenged even Herod to repent of his sins. In approximately 29 AD, Herod Antipas had John the Baptist arrested and put in prison. Later John was beheaded through a plot devised by Herodias, the illegal wife of Herod and ex-wife of his brother, Philip. \nIn Luke 7:28, Jesus declared John the Baptist to be the greatest man to have ever lived: \"I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John ...\" John the Baptist's Strengths \nJohn's greatest strength was his focused and faithful commitment to the call of God on his life. Taking the Nazirite vow for life, he personified the term \"set apart for God.\" John knew he had been given a specific job to do and he set out with singular obedience to fulfill that mission. He didn't just talk about repentance from sin . He lived with boldness of purpose throughout his uncompromising mission, willing to die a martyr for his stand against sin. Life Lessons \nJohn the Baptist did not set out with the goal of being different from everyone else. Although he was remarkably strange, he wasn't merely aiming at uniqueness. Rather, he targeted all of his efforts toward obedience. Obviously, John hit the mark, as Jesus called him the greatest of men. \nWhen we come to realize that God has given us a specific purpose for our lives, we can move forward with confidence, fully trusting the One who called us. Like John the Baptist, we don't have to fear living with a radical focus on our God-given mission. Can there be any greater joy or fulfillment in this life than to know God's pleasure and reward awaits us in heaven? Undoubtedly, moments after his beheading John the Baptist must have heard his master say, \"Well done!\" Hometown \nBorn in the hill country of Judah; Lived in the wilderness of Judea. Referenced in the Bible \nIn Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 4:5, John's coming was foretold. All four Gospels mention John the Baptist: Matthew 3, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17; Mark 6 and 8; Luke 7 and 9; John 1. He is also referenced several times throughout the book of Acts .
