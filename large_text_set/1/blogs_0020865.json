The feature launched within Google Translate in early 2015 with a handful of languages, and later expanded to support dozens more .\nWith Japan serving as a major tourist destination, and Japanese not the easiest of languages to get to grips with, this is a notable expansion for Google Translate and Word Lens.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T12:26:10.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
