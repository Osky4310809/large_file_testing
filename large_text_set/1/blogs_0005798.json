Ruhle reined in her panel when things got out of hand, after which, Corn brought up how Trump kept hinting that he would take the word of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over America’s intelligence community when it comes to who hacked the Democratic National Committee. \nCortes responded that “it’s what the mainstream media has been saying for weeks, which is that the election was hacked, and that’s simply not true.” Ruhle took issue with that, and she immediately brought the discussion to a halt and chastised Cortes. \n“Steve, I’m not going to let you make a generalization about the media…I’m not making a generalization about anything. I’m not saying the results, I’m not saying that the election would have been different had the hacking not happened, but in terms of this special information that Donald Trump has, what is it?” \nRuhle was referring to how Trump hinted that he would reveal new information about the hacking earlier this week, which the mogul didn’t end up producing. Ruhle has cracked the whip in interviews with Trump surrogates in the past. \nTrump has received a briefing with the details about the intelligence community’s consensus about Russia’s campaign to interfere with the election. Trump’s team put out a statement afterwards, saying that Russia’s actions “ had no effect on the outcome of the election. ” \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T05:56:34.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
