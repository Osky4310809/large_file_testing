Download Now Aml Maple 5.05 Terms and conditions \nAml Maple is the keyboard layout indicator for Windows. Aml Maple has a new kind of view on keyboard layout indicators: simple, modern, flexible. Aml Maple indicates the active layout being currently used (the language you are typing at this particular moment). It is always in front of you, exactly at the place you are typing! An usage is very simple. For example, you can configure the red cursor for English and the blue cursor one for French (or any other). Once you change your language layout, cursor color will change accordingly. It's easy to find: just look at the typing place or mouse cursor. It's easy to understand: current layout can be indicated with colored symbols and/or national flag icon. It's easy to use: indicator is compatible with absolutely most of the programs: both windowed and console. It's easy to correct text: select incorrect text, press hotkey — receive text in correct keyboard layout. \nJust try it. Just buy it. Just use it. \nCoupon code: GOTD System Requirements: \nWindows 95/ 98/ ME/ NT/ 2000/ XP/ Vista/ 7/ 8; 32 MB RAM; 1.5 MB HDD Publisher:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:14:53.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
