Murray spoke at Villanova today and a few protesters who showed up had to be removed . \nCarlson asked Ciccariello-Maher about his problems with Murray. Ciccariello-Maher brought up the same issues protesters have raised about Murray’s book The Bell Curve , telling Carlson, “I think the question is really also about the content of these writings… This is someone who is defined as a white nationalist by the Southern Poverty Law Center.” (Murray recently posted a lengthy response to the SPLC, essentially copy editing the information they have about him .) \nCarlson brought up Ciccariello-Maher’s “All I Want for Christmas is White Genocide” tweet that led to a statement from Drexel publicly calling his comments “utterly reprehensible.” Ciccariello-Maher told Carlson, as he did back in December, that it was meant to be satirical. \nCarlson moved on to another of his tweets — one from this week, in which he said , “Some guy gave up his first class seat for a uniformed soldier. People are thanking him. I’m trying not to vomit or yell about Mosul.” \nCarlson asked, “Was that satire too?” \nCiccariello-Maher said that his point was that it’s “irresponsible” to blindly support wars that get people killed. The mention of Mosul in his tweet was referencing recent reports of local civilians being killed in U.S. airstrikes . \nBut things got more personal when Carlson told him that he looked at some of his writing, telling him, “You’re not an impressive scholar, that’s what I’m saying. You’re a performance artist! … Your writing is childlike!” \nCiccariello-Maher responded by telling Carlson he sounds “incapable of grasping very simple and very basic things.” \nYou can see how the rest of that unfolded above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T05:33:33.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
