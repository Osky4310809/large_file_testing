Not only was it one of the catalysts for the revolution against traditional cable and TV companies, but it’s also completely changing the way we view media—and not just re-runs of old TV shows no one cares about.\nNetflix is quickly becoming a cultural resource. According to the folks from DMR , Netflix users watched over 42 billion hours of streaming television in 2015 and roughly 100 million hours daily. As of January 19, 2017, there were just over 93 million total Netflix subscribers. In the next year, Netflix will be adding an additional 1,000 hours of Netflix-exclusive content, up a 43% increase over last year’s 700 added hours.\nWhile those numbers and statistics are intriguing, the only thing they tell us is that Netflix is expanding and growing. The broader issue then becomes: With all that incredible content, how can subscribers take the best advantage of it all? Outside of Netflix’s specially curated home screen, how are we supposed to truly explore its remarkable database of some of the world’s best visual content?\nGood question, bud.

At least, not until Reddit uberw00t did just that. More than the typical “comedies” and “dramas” tags, these categories often get super specific—“Dramas Based on Real Life,” “Dutch Movies” and “Political Thrillers” are just a couple of the oddly specific genres you could explore—if you know what you’re doing.\nCheck out the list and find a genre that you’re interested in. Then, copy and paste this URL into your browser: “Http://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/”\nAfter that, take the numerical code of the genre you’re interested in and paste it after the “genre/”. So, for instance, “Social & Cultural Documentaries,” which has a number of 3675, would be: “Http://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/3675”.\nNetflixBestOfSubReddit Painful to admit as it may be, Reddit has slowly become a wonderful resource for literally anyone interested in anything.
