He literally lined up 100 Black Tooths and it was just me and him and a couple of other people there. So we just started doing shots... there was a hundred shots lined up on the bar. We were doing our best to finish those hundred so Darrell would have to buy another hundred. \n\"The next thing I knew [laughs], I was being carried out by Rex and I don't even know who else was carrying me out. I passed out face first on the ground after God knows how many shots. \n\"I was already drunk when I got there. Yeah, I passed out face first, luckily I didn't break anything and they carried me out on the street and sat me down. I'm just sitting there trying to get my wits back; people were coming into the bar and knew who I was and they're like, 'What the fuck happened to you?' \n\"I tried to rally and finish the hundred but I left, if I remember correctly I got in a cab and took off. So that's just one of many drunken stories.\" \nThe more you know...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:55:54.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
