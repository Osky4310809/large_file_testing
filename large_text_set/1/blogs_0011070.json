Did he understand Israel’s “sense of betrayal?” \n“No,” Obama replied. “I’ll be honest with you: That kind of hyperbole, those kinds of statements, don’t have a basis in fact.” \n“They may work well with respect to deflecting attention from the problem of settlements,” the president continued. “They may play well with Bibi’s political base, as well as the Republican base here in the United States, but they don’t match up with the facts.” \nDayan asked Obama whether he had more surprises up his sleeve at the UN before his term is up or whether Netanyahu could sleep soundly until President-elect Donald Trump takes over on January 20. \nObama’s response was cynical: “Well, I think there’s an interesting question as to whether he’ll sleep better after January 20,” he said. \nHe further suggested that if Trump chooses to support Israel no matter what its policies are, the situation will only deteriorate. \n“Unfettered support for Israel, and support for the Netanyahu government’s policies, no matter what they are, no matter how inimical they may be to the prospect of peace, if that’s what qualifies as a good friend, I believe we will see a worsening situation over time,” he said. \nAccording to the report, Obama said Netanyahu had a friend in the White House for eight years but failed to recognize that fact. He also reemphasized that the U.S. has a deep commitment to the Jewish state, but added the caveat that this commitment is to an Israel that respects human rights. \nObama and Netanyahu have had a frosty relationship over the past eight years, often sparring on various issues, not least of which were settlements and the nuclear deal with Iran. \nRead More Stories About: \nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.
