The applicant needs to have a genuine link with Malta and needs to prove he has a minimum 12-month residency. \nThe application would then be approved by the relevant competent authority. Identity Malta will be obliged to carry out a due diligence exercise. \nSports parliamentary secretary Chris Agius said the initiative was moulded on similar schemes overseas. \nMr Agius said athletes like Fiona May and singer Tina Turner were among the many who had applied for such schemes overseas. \nThe consultation document is available by clicking here. \n« Valletta developers are worse threat than Luftwaffe, residents say Four-car collision in Burmarrad, man hospitalised » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=82157674804&n=1f272632' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=82157674804&n=1f272632' border='0' alt='' /> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
