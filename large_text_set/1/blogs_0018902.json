A lot of young players. If their government wants that, it will happen. \n“At the beginning, they were going after all players. Now they’re starting to get medium players at the age of 26, 27– and it could be a big problem for all of us in the Premier League.

Good, solid, excellent mentality. \n“I like that he records all of his training sessions. He wants to look at all of the goals we concede. He wants to see what happened, where his position was, if he could improve it. \n“And when Kasper broke his hand, of course we missed him. I miss all of the players when they have done so well.” \nRanieri’s season has been a bumpy ride so far. \nSuccess has come in ­the shape of qualifying from the Champions League group stage.
