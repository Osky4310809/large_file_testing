They all basically say the same thing – giving the government the power to affect withdrawal from the European Union.\" Government minister \nT he drafts will only be needed if the Supreme Court decides that MPs and peers must approve the start of Brexit talks before the Government can trigger talks. \nThe ruling, to be announced at 9.30am on Tuesday, marks the culmination of months of uncertainty about Mrs May’s ability to start Brexit of her own accord. \nSenior lawyers involved in the case will hear the judgement privately at 8am and can only communicate the result to the Prime Minister at 9.15am, just 15 minutes before it is made public.

They all basically say the same thing – giving the government the power to affect withdrawal from the European Union,” a government minister said. \n“Even though the draftsmen have prepared drafts, we’re not regarding any of them as final until we know what the judgement says. \n“We have no idea what the judges are going to say. The wording of the judgments is of extreme importance.” \nAnother minister said the proposed law will be just a few sentences long: “It was never going to be a magnums opus. It was always going to be a short, tight Bill.\" \nMinisters will face a race against time if they are to get approval from the Commons and the Lords by the end of March – Mrs May’s self-imposed deadline for triggering talks. \nThey hope legislation can clear the Commons with just a few days debate and reach the Lords by the end of February, leaving a full month for it to pass.
