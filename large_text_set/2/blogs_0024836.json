A successful fitness blogger, Hembrow has more than 5.5 million followers on Instagram alone, making her a bonafide celebrity. She’s also the founder of a successful exercise program , made famous by her own incredible body transformation. Despite all that, she’s still just a woman—and like any woman who has had a child, Hembrow’s body changed significantly during her second pregnancy. As Cosmopolitan reports, in addition to the weight gain and puffiness that comes with nearly all pregnancies, Hembrow developed diastasis recti, a relatively common complication in which the abdominal muscles separate in order to make room for the fetus. Though she resumed her intense exercise regimen after giving birth, quickly returning to her pre-baby figure, Hembrow still carries loose skin on her stomach from the complication—and likely will for a long time.

In a recent post, Hembrow showed off her beautiful baby girl and her post-baby belly, writing: “Proud of my mama bod & my loose skin.” The photo, which has been liked nearly 440,000 times is a rare look at what really happens to a woman’s body after giving birth. As Hembrow demonstrates, even the fittest mothers undergo long-lasting physical changes, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it’s something to be proud of. (We can all agree that bringing new life into the world is pretty miraculous, no?)
