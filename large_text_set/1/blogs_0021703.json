Going, ‘This guy, after going this long playing to so many people, still gets that excited.’ I don’t want to lose that.”\nSo much respect for this dude not only as an artist but as a man! Thank you @dariusrucker and your whole crew for having us out this summer was unbelievable! #goodforagoodtimetour \nA photo posted by Michael Ray (@michaelraymusic) on Sep 12, 2016 at 10:39am PDT \nWhile traveling across the country on the Think a Little Less tour , there is one particular person in his life Ray never forgets to update: his longtime girlfriend, Carli Manchaca.\n“She’s great — she knows she’s got me wrapped,” Ray jokes about how he handles all the lady fan attention amid balancing his relationship. “One thing that I always try to do is keep a regular schedule of calling and talking on the road, and try not to go too long without being home. Sometimes it’s hit or miss, so FaceTime and iPhones have definitely made it easier.”\nThankful ❤️ \nA photo posted by Michael Ray (@michaelraymusic) on Nov 25, 2016 at 12:05pm PST \nAnd post-tour date nights are all about keeping it “chill.”\n@cma awards and Carli were last night!! Honored to have been in the presence of such incredible artist beside the most breath taking woman!! Thank you @thedryhousenashville for helping me get this hair under control!!! \nA photo posted by Michael Ray (@michaelraymusic) on Nov 3, 2016 at 10:49am PDT \n“Sometimes we’re just chillin’, kickin’ back and grillin’ steaks on the grill and listening to music and drinking wine at the house, and sometimes it’s hanging out with our friends at Tin Roof in Nashville,” he says about their ideal date night. “Once in a while, I think it’s always nice to have that date night and go to a nice restaurant.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T03:29:07.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
