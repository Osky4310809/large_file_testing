Ross Craig and his partner Anna Handzel (Photo: Internet Unknown) Ross and Anna on holiday (Photo: Internet Unknown) \nThe offences happened in 2006 – but Craig fled to Cyprus in an attempt to avoid justice. \nHe was on bail when he attacked the men but was again freed on bail after his arrest. \nHe didn't turn up for a court date in 2007 and was arrested on his return from Cyprus in March 2010, \nThe High Court in Edinburgh heard his victims – a soldier and his friend – found a man in the street who was bleeding from a head injury. Ross and Anna on holiday (Photo: Internet Unknown) Anna was comforting Craig last night (Photo: Internet Unknown) \nCraig and a pal had just walked past and the two men suspected they were to blame and ended up in a fight. \nCraig pulled out a seven-inch knife and stabbed one man twice in the back and thigh and slashed his face. The other was also slashed and suffered chest wounds. \nIt’s thought police are checking to see if there is a link between yesterday’s shooting and Craig’s violent past. \nCraig set up swanky florist Regal Roses in January with Anna. \nA van bearing their logo was parked in the drive of his house in Shawhill Road, Shawlands, where the shooting took place.

The car turned right into Woodstock Avenue or Peveril Avenue. \nForensics officers were still searching the area late last night.

It is being treated as attempted murder.

Laundry worker Jain Sudha, 40, said: “Shawlands Primary School is just down the road. It’s terrible to think this has happened here.” \nHair stylist Teighan McNab, 22, said: “Police were in asking around to see if anyone had any CCTV footage.” Police at the scene (Photo: Daily Record) Forensics examined the property (Photo: Daily Record) Read More \nThe attack happened about 150 yards from St Conval’s Primary School. The shooting follows several similar incidents in the city in recent months. \nIn November, Euan Johnston, 26, was shot dead in a drive-by on Shields Road on the southside. \nGangland figure Ross Monaghan, 35, was shot in the shoulder at the gates of St George’s Primary School in Penilee in January. \nLast month, thugs opened fire on the house of crime lord Jamie Daniel’s son Francis “Fraggle” Green in the north of the city in a mob feud.
