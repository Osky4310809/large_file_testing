The movie stars travel to various locations, interact with fans and even hold special activities to ramp up the buzz around the film. Sometimes though, the stars and team of the film can take the promotional process a little too far. While some of these crazy tactics may actually work for the film, some may turn out in a completely unexpected way. For instance, Shah Rukh Khan's recent promotion for Raees , while a unique idea, caused the death of a fan in Vadodara . Here are some crazy things Bollywood stars have done to promote their films, for better or for worse. Vidya Balan for Kahaani \nWhile promoting her film Kahaani , about a pregnant woman who comes to Kolkata to look for her missing husband, Vidya came to Khar station in Mumbai, in her pregnant get-up from the film. She carried posters of her missing husband, asked people at the station to help her find him, and even boarded the train looking for him. Pulkit Samrat and Yami Gautam for Sanam Re \nAround the release of their film Sanam Re , it was rumoured that Pulkit Samrat and his co-star Yami Gautam were dating. It later came out that the relationship was just created to promote their film, but unfortunately, it also brought about problems in Pulkit's marriage. We really don't understand the need to resort to such low forms of publicity, especially when it can affect people's lives so negatively. Shahid Kapoor and Genelia D'Souza for Chance Pe Dance \nSince the film was about a broke actor who lived out of his car, struggling to achieve his dreams, Shahid and Genelia spent the night in a car, to promote the film. A little bit overdone, don't you think? Mahesh Bhatt for Criminal \nTo promote his film Criminal , about the murder of a woman, played by Manisha Koirala, Bhatt put an ad in a newspaper saying that the actress had been murdered and the killer was still on the run. People frantically called up the newspaper, where they were informed that it was just an ad. Spreading rumours about someone's death to promote a film is a low we can't even fathom, and the filmmaker received severe backlash for this tactic. Jackie Shroff for Gardish \nGardish , a film where Jackie Shroff plays a man who is wanted by the police, was promoted with an April Fool's ad in a paper called Good Day , saying that Jackie had been arrested. While the audience didn't react to this ad as badly as they did to the one about Manisha Koirala, Jackie himself was affected, because the article talked about his supposed relation to gangsters in Mumbai.
