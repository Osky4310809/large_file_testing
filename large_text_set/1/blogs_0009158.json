Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as the next U.S. attorney general and pushed back against Rev. Al Sharpton’s criticism of Sessions’ nomination.\n“Now allegations have been made that Senator Sessions is a racist; however, an examination of his record proves otherwise. As a U.S. attorney for the state of Alabama, he prosecuted Klansman Henry Francis Hays, as has been mentioned earlier. Henry Francis Hays was the son of Bennie Hays, who was one of the leading members of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan,” Rev. Ralph Chittams of the Forestville New Redeemer Baptist Church in Maryland said at a Monday press conference on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Frederick Douglass Foundation and the Family Research Council's Watchmen on the Wall.\n“He [Sessions] insisted that trial be a capital murder trial and Hays was convicted of capital murder and was sentenced to be executed. A little while later, then-state attorney general Jeff Sessions oversaw a process where Hays received the punishment as decided by the court of law and was executed. As a direct result of those actions, a civil judgment in the amount of $7 million was entered against the Alabama Ku Klux Klan, which effectively bankrupted them,” he added.\nChittams, senior vice chairman of the Washington, D.C., Republican Party and a member of the Frederick Douglass Foundation of Washington, said Sessions “spearheaded” the effort to honor Rosa Parks with the congressional gold medal in 1999 and gave a speech on the Senate floor in support of Parks.\nAs PJM previously reported , Al Sharpton promised a “season of civil disobedience” surrounding the Sessions nomination on a press call with other civil rights activists from organizations including the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza. The activists argued that Sessions should not be attorney general in part because of his support for voter identification laws.\nBishop Jim Lowe, pastor at the Guiding Light Church in Birmingham, Ala., said every American needs an ID to enter a federal building or purchase alcohol, so requiring one to vote is not unfair.\n“No, I don’t think it’s unfair. As a matter of fact, it’s because of Rev. Sharpton that I have come forward because I don’t agree with many of the things he says and I stand for something entirely different – it’s as simple as that,” said Lowe.\n“When I came through this building they asked me for some type of ID. How do they know who I am unless I have some type of ID? I don’t know how my other brothers may feel and I can remember the things they used to do to keep us from voting, but this is a different America. This is an America where every citizen has the right to vote and should not be denied the right to vote. But this is a country where we must make sure we protect the integrity of the vote,” Lowe added.\n politics/2017/01/10/african-american-religious-leaders-slam-sharpton-endorse-sessions-for-attorney-general/\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_8pgCws1NcE"], "published": "2017-01-10T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T19:52:15.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
