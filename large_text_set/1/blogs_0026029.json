Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe mysterious case of a pretty teenage girl who vanished in Spain continues to dumbfound the whole of Ireland almost a decade on. \nIndeed, Amy Fitzpatrick's sudden disappearance is one of the most baffling missing persons cases in Irish history. \nThe blue-eyed 15-year-old teen went missing from Riviera del Sol in Mijas Costa, near Fuengirola, on New Year ’s Day in 2008. \nAmy was not officially reported missing until January 3 - and no trace of the teenager has ever been found. \nDublinLive reports that her best friend Ashley Rose and her mother Debbie said the teen detested stepfather Dave Mahon - the man would later go on to kill her only brother in May 2013. \nThe unsolved mystery surrounding Amy's disappearance loomed large over his trial - when he was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter. \nThis is what we know about the case so far: No trace of Amy has been found since she vanished almost 10 years ago When was she last seen? \nAmy was last seen leaving her friend Ashley Rose's house. \nThe pretty teen was living with her late brother Dean, mum Audrey Fitzpatrick and stepfather Dave Mahon at the time. Could Amy have run away? \nSpanish police don't believe she ran away as she had no money and apart from Ashley Rose and a few others, had no other friends in Spain. Mum Audrey and her partner Dave Mahon pictured arriving home at Dublin Airport Was Amy spotted after she set out from home? \nUnconfirmed reports claimed that Spanish police believe Amy was spotted in a local bar an hour and a half after her last known sighting. \nIt was New Year’s Day and the bars would have been packed - and it's possible Amy didn't want to go home so decided to go to one of them. \nShe would have been allowed in as, when it comes to age limits, Spanish bars are more lenient and Amy looked older than her 15 years. \nDid she meet someone who abducted her?

I saw her do it.” \nIt has never been established how the phone got back to the property if Amy was abducted on her way home that night.

What are Spanish police doing about the case? \nSpanish police maintain they have not closed the teenager’s file and they will actively pursue any new leads. \nBut unfortunately, because of the transient nature of life on the Costa del Sol, many of those who lived in the area at the time - and who might have been able to help detectives with their enquiries - have since moved away.

No trace of the teenager has ever been found.
