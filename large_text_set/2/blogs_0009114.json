Many people likely experienced this feeling inside The Plaza Hotel, where Christian Siriano debuted his Fall 2017 collection. The designer created a total of 52 runway looks, inspired by \"beehive sand formations,\" that incorporated gorgeous copper metallics and golden hues. \nThe show opened with a multicolored furry coat but quickly turned into a parade of one-shoulder gowns, luxurious velvet blazers, and sophisticated trousers. The outfits gave off an air of elegance as if to say, \"wear me to an Oscars afterparty, please.\" As pretty as the looks were, however, it was equally important to note the models wearing them. Siriano is vocal about size inclusivity on the runway , so it wasn't a complete surprise when a handful of curvier models such as Iskra Lawrence and Sabina Karlsson appeared on the catwalk. They too were part of Siriano's story. \nAs the show drew to an end, it seemed the designer had one final message to deliver. He sent a model down the runway in a black t-shirt that read, \"People Are People,\" drawing loud claps and cheers from the audience. Given how politicized the fashion industry has become , Siriano just made one heck of a statement on the catwalk. And you can only assume which side he is on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:49:38.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
