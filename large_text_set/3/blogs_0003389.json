What is important actually is the safety equipment for the landing of the aircraft. \n“We have seen the runway is good, the Instrument Landing System (ILS) has been installed and the terminal building is ready. \n“The contractor has been directed by the Acting President to redouble his effort so that the remaining items of work that are remaining should be completed before the commencement of the international operations in Kaduna. \n“I think this is one of the luckiest airports; they have five generators as standby power supply. So we have more than enough,’’ he said. \nSimilarly, Mr Fola Akinkuotu, Managing Director of NAMA, told NAN that once the Abuja Airport was closed, NAMA would deploy the mobile tower from the airport to Kaduna to complement what is already on ground. \nHe said that NAMA management had certified the capability of Kaduna Airport, adding that its engineers have done a good job on it. \n“As far as this (Kaduna) airport is concerned, NAMA management, we are very satisfied that we have done a good job. \n“At the inception of the project, the ILS (Instrument Landing System) was not accessible but as of today, I can tell you that not only have we installed a brand new ILS, we have also calibrated it. \n“We have a calibration certificate from a UK concern. \n“On the facilities for landing, like I said, the ILS which comprises the glide scope and localizer have been calibrated and they have been found satisfactory like 10 on 10. \n“Apart from that, we also have the approach light that actually complement and make sure that they have the ILS.’’ \nThe Minister of State, Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, announced the use of the Kaduna airport as alternative for the Abuja airport that would be closed for six weeks for repairs of its runway.
