It seems to hold true that measuring your activity will help you lose weight. Not so fast— the evidence doesn’t seem to support the belief , the New York Times reports. In fact, one study found that people wearing fitness devices actually lost nearly half as much weight as those who didn’t wear them over the course of 18 months. \nPet Your Cat No, owning a cat won’t trigger psychosis , researchers from University College London conclude. Previously, experts hypothesized that cat ownership may contribute to some mental disorders like schizophrenia, since they are a host of the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii, which has been linked to brain issues. But this current research, which looked at cats in households when kids were growing up, showed no evidence that cats pose a health risk. \nTreat Heartburn Safely We’ve previously reported on the risks of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for treating heartburn . Now, there may be one more to add to the mix: kidney damage. Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis discovered that people taking PPIs can develop silent, gradual kidney problems , which can lead to long-term damage or even renal failure. PPIs include meds like Prevacid, Prilosec, and Nexium. \nPrevent Diabetes A new treatment for diabetes may come from an unlikely source: a weight-loss drug. When researchers injected obese, prediabetic patients with the appetite-suppressing drug liraglutide, they were 80 percent less likely to develop diabetes three years later than those not given the drug. And 60 percent of those patients had blood sugar readings that returned to healthy levels, according to the study in The Lancet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:35:26.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
