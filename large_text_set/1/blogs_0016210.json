This Portuguese hotel, which houses more than 50,000 books , might just be the thing your literary travel dreams are made of.\nThe Literary Man hotel is located in the incredible medieval town Óbidos, Portugal , housed in what used to be a convent. Wall upon wall in the old building is flanked with books – 50,000 of them, to be exact. Guests can purchase many of the books, but others belong to the hotel and are only available to read while relaxing in the historic hotel’s massive lounge.\nA photo posted by Melhor Literatura (@melhorliteratura) on Dec 27, 2015 at 1:21pm PST \nWe’re not complaining: That sounds like paradise to us. According to the Huffington Post , the city of Óbidos has embraced a book-loving culture, with an annual literary festival and bookshop upon bookshop sprouting up within the walled city.\nA photo posted by Eliana Freitas (@elianarrfreitas) on Nov 3, 2015 at 11:17am PST \nSounds like we need to book ourselves a flight to Portugal, with a stay at The Literary Man on the itinerary. With an in-house gin bar and a lifetime of books to read, why would we ever want to leave?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:45:49.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
