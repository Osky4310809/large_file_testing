The rollout began earlier this week , however it’s reportedly now unavailable on devices where it previously appeared. Further, Xperia Blog says the software isn’t on Sony’s servers, as it should be.\nSony may have pulled the update after learning of a potentially harmful bug or critical issue with the software. Manufacturers typically roll out updates on a small scale to begin with in order to test reliability, before deploying it on all handsets. That said, Sony has successfully rolled out the software to a number of other devices already, which means critical issues with it are unlikely.\nGiven Sony hasn’t made an announcement, we can only speculate, but it could simply be a mistake or malfunction.\nSee also: Sony prepping an Xperia XA successor, leaked renders suggest 1 day ago This week, Sony’s Android Nougat update also began landing on the Xperia Z5 Premium and Xperia Z3+. The Xperia Z5 Compact is expected to follow soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T17:17:21.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
