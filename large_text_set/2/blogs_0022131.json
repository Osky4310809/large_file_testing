Full winners list \nKimmel earnestly encouraged everyone watching to reach out to someone during this divided time in the political climate, before explaining that he was ready to \"bury the hatchet\" with someone he has \"had issues with\" - Matt. \n\"I've known Matt for a long time,\" Kimmel said. \"When I first met Matt, I was the fat one.\" \nKimmel then took a jab at Damon for giving Casey Affleck his Oscar-nominated role in Manchester by the Sea and making \"a Chinese pony tail movie instead,\" in reference to The Great Wall. \nThen, back to politics, Kimmel reverted back to another presidential slam.

That's gone, thanks to him.\" \nThe late night host rattled off a string of jokes about the nominated films and actors. His go-to joke, repeated several times with slightly different wording, is that no one in the audience saw any of the movies. \nThen, before his time was up, Kimmel gave due attention to Meryl Streep, who sat front and center in the Dolby Theatre.

As the camera turned on her, Meryl tried in vain to hide behind her husband. \n\"Meryl Streep has phoned it in for over 50 films in her lackluster career,\" he said. \"She wasn't even in a movie this year. We just wrote her name down out of habit.\" \nFinally, Kimmel called the audience to give Streep a \"totally undeserved round of applause\" and the crowd rose immediately to give her a rousing standing ovation. \nBut Kimmel couldn't let her go without referencing the drama surrounding Streep's gown for the evening: \"Nice dress, by the way.\" he said. \"Is that an Ivanka?\" Read More Ruth Negga (Photo: REUTERS) Read More Oscars 2017 best dressed: Karlie Kloss, Emma Stone, Ruth Negga and more bring glamour to the Academy Awards carpet \nThe red carpet also became a political one as celebrities subtly protested President Trump and his administration's policies. \nRuth Negga, who is nominated for her role in Loving, in which she plays the real-life Mildred Loving, who was jailed for entering a mixed-race marriage with husband Richard in 1950s Virginia, sported a blue ACLU ribbon in support of the American Civil Liberties Union. \nKarlie Kloss, Busy Philipps, and Lin Manuel Miranda also sported the ribbon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:31:43.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
