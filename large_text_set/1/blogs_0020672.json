James Pearce of the Liverpool Echo (h/t the Daily Star 's Alex Harris ) said the highly-rated Portugal international is not on Jurgen Klopp's shopping list as he hunts for additions to his squad. When asked in a question-and-answer forum if the powerful 24-year-old is on his way to Liverpool, Pearce stated: \"He's not a transfer target for LFC.\" Portuguese newspaper A Bola (h/t Metro ) had reported Carvalho was set to move to Merseyside in a potential Â£26 million deal. The player has been watched by Premier League clubs since the earlier days of his career, but he is yet to make the switch to a major European force. Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images Pearce's information will disappoint Liverpool fans who would have welcomed the skill set on offer from the midfielder. The Angola-born talent is now a regular in Portugal's national squad and has become a reliable defensive entity. The player started five games at UEFA Euro 2016, according to WhoScored.com , as his country swept to victory in the tournament led by Cristiano Ronaldo. Here is the midfielder in action: In other news, Mamadou Sakho is preparing to clear out his locker at Melwood as he thinks about a switch before the January window slams shut. French magazine Le10Sport (via James Cambridge of the Express ) reported the defender's disappointing spell on Merseyside could come to a swift end as Sakho considers transfers to Southampton or Russian side Spartak Moscow. Steve Bardens/Getty Images At the top of his game, Sakho is a very competent centre-back, and a move to the Saints could work out for him in minimal time. He has plenty of experience and is a physical presence who can dominate strikers. However, he lacks consistency and focus to play at a top club, and a switch to Russian football might be more suitable as he adjusts back into life as a first-team performer.
