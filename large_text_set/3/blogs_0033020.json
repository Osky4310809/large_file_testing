Morris employs the same stop-motion formula that made her music videos for Iron and Wine and Pure Bathing Culture so successful, with simple camera tricks and her prowess as a cinematographer turning her static paper sculptures into expressive and mesmerizing video graphics. Human silhouettes fan out into patterned paper planes that play with light and shadow in a way that pushes their forms into abstraction. Morris also incorporates small glass-blown pieces that ultimately merging with the surrounding wave of paper. \nCheck out the video in full below: \n\"The Ecstatics\" is a single off the Explosions in the Sky's seventh studio album, The Wilderness , which hit #9 on Billboard top albums list. \nYou can pick up The Wilderness on BandCamp and check out more work by Hayley Morris on her website .
