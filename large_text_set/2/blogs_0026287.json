Indeed, if you go to the Google Store today, you won’t find any Pixel laptops for sale, though there are plenty of third-party Chromebook available there. \nThe company is not, of course, talking about Chrome OS. “Chrome OS is a huge initiative in the company,” Osterloh said. “Google hasn’t backed away from laptops. We have the number two marketshare in the US and UK — but we have no plans for Google-branded laptops.” \nThe Pixel was always meant to be Google’s example of what a premium Chromebook could look like. They were never intended to sell in high numbers — and few people were probably willing to drop $1,299 for a laptop that only let you run the Chrome browser when it first launched it 2013. Instead, the Pixel was always meant to be aspirational. It was the first Chromebook to feature a touch screen, for example. It was also the first hardware device that showed that Google could build vertically integrated devices that could compete with the likes of Apple. \nThe second iteration of the Pixel Chromebook built upon the foundation of the first one. In terms of design, they were almost identical. This one, however, was even more powerful. It also featured USB-C charging ahead of virtually any other laptop line. The Pixel 2, however, was discounted without a replacement last August. In addition to using the Pixel brand for its new phone, Google is also still selling the Pixel C tablet . 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:48:14.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
