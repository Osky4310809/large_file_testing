Recording artist Beyonce   \nAs Beyonce, who announced she was expecting twins a few weeks ago, balanced precariously in the air, it appeared that every viewer at home let out a very loud gasp. \nAnd after the gasp, they then took to social media to share hundreds of memes and tweets. \nEchoing what everyone else was thinking, one fan wrote: \"Can you imagine being in charge of tipping a pregnant Beyonce backwards?\" \nAlongside a picture of the chair tipped backwards, another joked: \"Swiping through Bumble looking for a girl who will support me like this chair supports Beyonce.\" \nWhile others told her to never pull such a scary stunt again. \n\"It was breathtaking but don't ever. EVER. lean back in no damn chair like that ever. again. @beyonce . I'm not playing with you,\" a die-hard fan shared. \nBut two people who definitely won't be making memes out of the star are husband Jay Z and adorable Blue Ivy. \nAs she finished her show-stopping performance of ballads Love Drought and Sandcastles, cameras panned to her husband Jay Z who was giving her a standing ovation and adorable daughter Blue who was also clapping her mum.     Blue Ivy Carter and Jay Z   \nAnd viewers were also flooding Twitter with praise for the star, saying it was one of her most \"beautiful\" performances to date. \n\"Beyonce was serving pregnant goddess realness and I was living!\" said one, while another joked, \"Was I just baptised I think I was!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:38:54.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
