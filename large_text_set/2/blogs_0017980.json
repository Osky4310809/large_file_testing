We have seen both sports cars photographed in camouflage before, but never together and not with the Z5’s soft top down. \nWhile the Toyota Supra looks almost identical to previous test mules, the camouflaged Z5 has some noticeable differences, mostly in the rear end. The taillights on this prototype appear to be close to production, with horizontal lamp housings as opposed to the round dummy lights worn by Z5 testers we’ve seen in the past. \nThe previous spy shots captured the Z5’s modest trunk lid spoiler, but the latest shots show a more pronounced molded lip that contributes to a sportier-looking rear end. The simple-looking small, round exhaust tips have been replaced by larger oval-shaped ones, probably similar to what the production version will have. \nFrom the side, the new spy shots clearly show a new front fender, now with a vent right behind the front wheels. This not only adds a more aggressive look but likely also reduces air pressure in the wheel well, like the Air Breather vents found on other BMWs. \nAs we previously reported, the upcoming BMW Z5, the replacement for the Z4, and the Toyota Supra will share the same platform that is being co-developed by Toyota and BMW. Once finalized, both rear-wheel-drive vehicles are expected to be built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria. \nDetails on the powertrains have not been released, but expect to see turbocharged four- and six-cylinder engines sourced from BMW, although there are rumors the Supra will pack a Toyota-developed twin-turbo V-6. There have also been rumors of a hybrid powertrain later in production. \nPhoto source: CarPix", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:24:00.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
