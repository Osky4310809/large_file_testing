After taking it much slower than his first back surgery rehab J.J. Watt was back on the field training on Friday before the Texans faced the Oakland Raiders in the Wild Card Playoff game. \nWatt will not return until the 2017 season, being placed on IR before week 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T03:20:07.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
