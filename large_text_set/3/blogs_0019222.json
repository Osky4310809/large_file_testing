Javed - Plz help the Indian workers and send a report to me and Mr. K T Rama Rao. https://t.co/wl5PJdJef7 \nâ€” Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) March 21, 2017 \nSwaraj asked the Indian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Javed, to initiate action for the workers' release. Swaraj also sought a report from Javed on the matter. \nShe was responding to a tweet from Rao's official Twitter handle sharing a media report with details of the issue. \nIn a letter to Sushma Swaraj on Monday, KT Rama Rao drew her attention to the plight of the workers of Al-Hajry Overseas Company at Al-Hassa.

AFP \nHe said the migrant workers were in the captivity of the employer firm for the last 12 days without any food or basic amenities. \nHe urged the minister to raise the issue with Saudi Arabia to ensure that all the employees are safely released by the employer and repatriated to India at the earliest. \nThe minister said one of the workers Boragalla Shekhar informed that he along with 28 others from Telangana working for the company requested for leave to visit India. In response, the company, not only demanded $50,000 each to relieve them but also refused to provide the expenses for travel. \nFor redressal of their grievance, the individuals approached Labour Court and subsequently Amir Court for justice. The Amir Court issued directions to the employer to bear all expenses and send the 29 employees to their home country within three days. \nHowever, the company took all the 29 employees into custody and is holding them captive in a room at Allsafaniya Kouqt, Bodar, city Kanji, Saudi Arabia, denying them food, water or medicines and other basic amenities for the last 12 days. \nWith inputs from agencies \n  08:16  16 am Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:55:40.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
