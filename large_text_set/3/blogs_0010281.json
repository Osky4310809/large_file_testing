Here to love, learn, and grow. Mar 13 The Right’s Non-Existent Enemy Since the 60’s, the notion of political correctness has been a hot button topic for conservatives who want to preserve free speech — but the reality is that this played out tactic does more harm than good Today, a Facebook page at my university, called Professors of McMaster shared an interview that they had done with McMaster University’s President and Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Patrick Deane. I have to admit, I, like many other students, fangirl a little bit every time I see Dr. Deane in the hallways or getting a slice of pizza in our student centre eatery. He’s an incredible academic who’s heralded in the halls of university as being a friendly, yet stoic authority figure who represents McMaster. This is why his interview was one that did not sit well with me. His interview, which you can read here , implies that political correctness is something that is not welcome on our university campus — and, as implicit as it is, the transcript of his interview tells us that he’s not a proponent for safe spaces, as “that means universities are not always comfortable.” There is merit in what Dr. Deane’s said — I’m not here to try to take down the President of my university; someone who is far more educated than I am. I agree that universities should be grounds for thoughtful, meaningful discussion. What is not true is that “political correctness” is the thing that is ruining these discussions. Stuart Hall, a Jamaican cultural theorist, suggests that the idea of “political correctness actually began as an in-joke on the left: radical students on American campuses acting out an ironic replay of the Bad Old Days BS (Before the Sixties) when every revolutionary groupuscule had a party line about everything.” In her essay , “Toward a Feminist Sexual Revolution”, Ellen Willis said: “In the early eighties, when feminists used the term ‘political correctness’, it was used to refer sarcastically to the anti-pornography movement’s efforts to define a ‘feminist sexuality’.” The truth is that none of the stories that introduced the menace of political correctness could pinpoint where or when it had begun. Nor were they very precise when they explained the origins of the phrase itself. In the mainstream, however, the idea of political correctness really picked up in the 1980’s and 1990’s. Moira Weigel explains how “the previously obscure far-left term became common currency in the lexicon of the conservative social and political challenges against progressive teaching methods and curriculum changes in the secondary schools and universities of the U.S. — policies, behaviour, and speech codes that the speaker or the writer regarded as being the imposition of a liberal orthodoxy were described and criticized as ‘politically correct’.” One of the first and most influential was published in October 1990 by the New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, who warned — under the headline “ The Rising Hegemony of the Politically Correct ” — that the country’s universities were threatened by “a growing intolerance, a closing of debate, a pressure to conform”. Two articles on the topic in late 1990 in Forbes and Newsweek both used the term “THOUGHT POLICE” in their front page headlines, exemplifying the tone of the new usage of the term. After George Bush, in 1991 , used the term to discuss how it comes from the “laudable desire to sweep away sexism and racism and hatred, [but] replaces old prejudices with new ones”, it sky rocked to its use as a pejorative phrase, becoming especially widespread amongst conservatives in the States. It became a key term encapsulating conservative concerns about the left in culture and political debate more broadly, as well as in academia. Many of these articles recycled the same stories of campus controversies from a handful of elite universities, often exaggerated or stripped entirely of necessary context. The reality is that, until the 1980’s and 90’s — political correctness was used within the left as a critique of its own excessive orthodoxy. But, rapidly, the term was rebranded by the right, who turned its meaning inside out. All of a sudden, instead of being a phrase that leftists used to check dogmatic tendencies within their own movement, “political correctness” became a talking point for neoconservatives. They said that PC constituted a leftwing political programme that was seizing control of American universities and cultural institutions — and they were determined to stop it. Now, in 2017, we’ve seen Donald Trump run and win a US Presidential Election, wherein his whole shtick was that he was a candidate whose primary qualification was that he was “not a politician”. Whenever Trump said something outrageous, political pundits and commentators suggested he had finally “crossed a line”, and that his campaign was now doomed. But time and again, Trump supporters made it clear that they liked him because he wasn’t afraid to say what he thought. Fans praised the way Trump talked much more often than they mentioned his policy proposals. He tells it like it is, they said. He speaks his mind. He is not “politically correct”. But here’s the thing — Trump and his followers never defined “political correctness”, or specified who was enforcing it. They did not have to. The phrase conjured powerful forces determined to suppress inconvenient truths by policing language. In reality, the creation and indoctrination of the term “political correctness” was a useful invention for the Republican right because it helped the movement to drive a wedge between working-class people and the Democrats who claimed to speak for them. “Political correctness” became a term used to drum into the public imagination the idea that there was a deep divide between the “ordinary people” and the “liberal elite”, who sought to control the speech and thoughts of regular folk.Opposition to political correctness also became a way to rebrand racism in ways that were politically acceptable in the post-civil-rights era. By making fun of professors who spoke in language that most people considered incomprehensible, wealthy Ivy League graduates could pose as anti-elite. By mocking courses on writers such as Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, they made a racial appeal to white people who felt as if they were losing their country. As the 1990s wore on, multiculturalism became unequivocally associated with globalization, which was identified as “the force that was taking away so many jobs traditionally held by white working-class people”, and attacking it allowed conservatives to displace responsibility for the hardship that many of their constituents were facing. So, to come back to this interview with the President and Vice Chancellor of McMaster, when we think about the question that was asked to Dr. Deane — “What is your opinion on the present ‘politically-correct’ culture in Western universities?” — I think it lacks tact. It lacks tact, context, any sort of research, and, honestly, seems like a set up. We are aware of the social stigma and subsequent eye-rolling that happens when we mention political correctness. So, why phrase the question like this? Why ask this when, easily, the question could have been surrounding “changing cultural beliefs” on campus, or even regarding current events, like the rise of Donald Trump during such a tumultuous time. Would the answer not have been the same? Dr. Deane states, “Anything can and should be discussed on a campus that is allowed by the law. I personally don’t regard it as my job to decide what constitutes hate speech. That is a controversial category that needs to be tested and confirmed in the courts. That’s not to say anything can be said or done on this campus. One knows that antisocial, unconstructive, abusive speech when one sees it, and everyone has a responsibility to refrain from it. However, I favor a very permissive view on this matter, because if you don’t favor a very permissive view, who gets to decide what acceptable speech is?” Sure. This is true — universities campuses should be breeding grounds for intellectual debates. However, in our world, it’s imperative to think about context. As groups like Black Lives Matter and different movements against sexual violence gain strength, it is unsurprising that a spate of thinkpieces attack these participants in these movements, criticizing and trivializing them by saying that they’re obsessed with policing speech. Once again, the conversation initially focused on universities, but the buzzwords were new. Rather than “difference” and “multiculturalism”, we start hearing about “trigger warnings”, “safe spaces”, “microaggressions”, “privilege” and “cultural appropriation”. This time, however, it’s clear that the students are the ones receiving more scorn than professors. The more recent revival of this PC battle has appealed to the commonplace that millennials are spoiled narcissists who want to prevent anyone expressing opinions that they happen to find offensive. And that’s exactly what this response from Dr. Deane demonstrates. By saying, “if someone says something that makes a group of students feel distressed, that is a real issue to be considered. However, it doesn’t in my mind lead immediately to the conclusion that the person who said that thing needs to be shut down”, Dr Deane is, in essence, solidifying the belief that the “oversensitivity” among students acts as a hindrance to discourse and education in the classroom, when that’s just not true. Beyond hurting someone’s feelings, it’s about what we say and how we act can perpetuate ideologies that ultimately promote oppressive views. These folks, like Dr. Peterson from U of T , commit many of the same fallacies that their predecessors from the 1990s had. They cherry-pick anecdotes and caricature the subjects of their criticism. They complain that other people (the “regressive left”) are creating and enforcing speech codes, while at the same time attempting to enforce their own speech codes. They complain about being silenced while silencing others. Dr Deane saying that, “The ability to disagree with others, and engage in thoughtful discussion is one of the hallmarks of an effective education, and something that I will always strive to preserve”, is true. We should be able to disagree and engage in thoughtful discussion — that’s what higher education is about. But if professors and university administration and other students are going to continue to tell “left leaning” students and academics that they’re need to be able to disagree while still engaging in thoughtful discussion about, typically, their own oppression — then you need to do the same for the right, for the anti-PC people. Because the reality is that when individuals that speak out on acts of oppression are told that their beliefs are “too politically correct” ultimately derails the conversation and forgoes an opportunity for a mutually beneficial learning experience — and isn’t that, too, counterproductive to the nature of university? In the 90’s, universities began creating new “studies departments” — these interrogated the experiences, and emphasized the cultural contributions of groups that had previously been excluded from the academy and from the canon: queer people, people of colour and women. This was not so strange. These departments reflected new social realities. The demographics of college students were changing, because the demographics of the United States were changing. By 1990, only two-thirds of Americans under 18 were white. In California, the freshman classes at many public universities were “majority minority”, or more than 50% non-white. Changes to undergraduate curriculums reflected changes in the student population, and these changes are ones that continue to be directly relevant to our university population today. We continue to speak out about Black Lives Matter rallies, we shut down professors who dehumanize us by insisting that race, gender, sexuality, disability are topics that can be debated upon while being “neutral”, because that simply is not the reality. The opponents of political correctness have consistently, throughout history, always, said they were crusaders against authoritarianism. But, in fact, anti-PC has paved the way for the populist authoritarianism, and the era of Trump exemplifies how this anti-PC movement takes those leaders who understood the power that anti-political-correctness has to rally a class of people, largely white, who are disaffected with the status quo and resentful of shifting cultural and social norms. They were not reacting to the tyranny of political correctness, nor were they returning our world to a previous phase of its history. They were not taking anything back. They were wielding anti-political-correctness as a weapon, using it to forge a new political landscape and a frightening future. The argument of “freedom of speech” is typically defined as our right to voice our opinion without the fear of punishment. However, ensuring that we are careful in the things we say and do does not counter that. Rather, it helps to protect individuals whose voices and stories are typically are spoken over. The right’s creation of this phantom enemy of “political correctness” is silly at best, especially when the reality surrounding PC-culture is ensuring that our language aids in the facilitation of a campus environment that is conducive to learning — not the opposite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:34:19.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
