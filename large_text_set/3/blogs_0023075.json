Tom Hemmer, a Republican, said if Illinois wants to recognize presidents, there is one who has been overlooked. \n“I represent … the hometown of President Ronald Reagan,” he said. “President Reagan is the only president who was born in the state of Illinois, the only president who went to grade school and high school and college in the state of Illinois, the only president to spend his formative years among the people of the great state of Illinois. But we don’t have a holiday for President Reagan.” \nOthers had sticker shock from the cost of establishing Barack Obama Day. \nThe budget office of Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, said a legal holiday would cost the state $3.2 million in holiday pay for essential workers and result in a $16 million loss in productivity. \n“The concept you are working on here, giving President Obama a day, I think is deserved. I think it’s appropriate, but I have a couple of questions about how we are doing it,” said Rep. Steve Andersson , R-Geneva. \nSuggestions emerged that naming a day for Obama, but not making it a legal holiday, would avoid the cost while still recognizing Obama. \nTwo other proposals exist to memorialize Obama. One would label a section of Interstate 55 the “Barack Obama Presidential Expressway.” Another would rename the Tri-State Tollway, which runs primarily through Chicago’s western and southern suburbs, as the “President Barack Obama Tollway.” What do you think?
