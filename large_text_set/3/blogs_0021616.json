Sign Up Today The Associated Press \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, March 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \nWASHINGTON • The spotlight for Sean Spicer never fades. \nNot when he serves a president who tweets set-the-world-on-edge messages in the middle of the night. Not when he’s surrounded by media old and new, some of whom his boss has called the most dishonest people in the world, in daily briefing dramas that are drawing more viewers than the soap operas in the same afternoon time slots. \nNot when he is the subject of a “Saturday Night Live” parody of a ranting, raving, podium-moving spokesman that has infused pop culture. \nNot when, against the facts and known evidence, his boss, President Donald Trump, continues to perpetuate an explosive charge that FBI Director James Comey says he has no evidence of: that Trump’s New York skyscraper was “wiretapped” by his predecessor, Barack Obama, during the 2016 campaign. \n“Sean Spicer is doing a great job dealing with the Media’s hysteria,” @TEN_GOP tweeted shortly after his first briefing in January, a bizarre lecture in which a tired Spicer argued against photographic evidence while asserting the media purposely downsized Trump’s inaugural crowd estimates. \nTwo days later, @fryarlaw tweeted: “Hardest job in America: Defending the ravings of an idiot every day.” \nSay what you mean, America! \nThis is the Trump Age of Good! or Bad! \nIn the middle of this cultural mayhem is Spicer, heretofore known to reporters who covered him in his previous job heading communications for the Republican National Committee as congenial and cooperative, but lately as combative and caustic and, sometimes, downright befuddling. \nRecent White Houses have always spun, but usually within reach of selectively coherent facts. This president, and by extension his chief mouthpiece, seem frequently at war with them. \nThat was the case in Monday’s regular briefing , a 45-minute back-and-forth with reporters in which Spicer urged listeners to conclude that Trump’s campaign had done nothing wrong in making contact with Russian agents despite Comey’s groundbreaking assertion that the FBI was investigating Trump-Russia ties as part of a broader investigation of Russian influence on the U.S. election. \nMeanwhile, Spicer simultaneously argued that it was too early to conclude that Obama didn’t wiretap Trump despite Comey’s clear assertion that he knew of no facts to back that claim, and that no one else in the Justice Department did, either. \nHeads shook in a hot, shabby White House briefing room designed to seat 49 but daily crowded with twice that number, including a few newcomers who have arrived with bold pro-Trump declarations. Those include a writer for the St. Louis-based Gateway Pundit, an unabashedly pro-Trump website. \nSpicer’s Monday briefing exposed every aspect of a Spicer-press main event. \nHe was scolding (“it’s not your press briefing… calm down,” he told ABC’s Jonathan Karl); spinning (“there’s a difference between talking about an investigation between the 2016 election, which we all know, and any evidence of collusion”); secretarial (“on Thursday, the president will hold an event with truck drivers”); and sassy (he told a reporter for the New York Times, which Trump describes as “failing,” that “I think your headlines are bad” and offered, with a chuckle, to help the Times rewrite theirs). \nThe White House press corps has evolved and expanded rapidly under Trump, and regularly includes foreign correspondents not usually in attendance and even some, like the new Gateway Pundit correspondent, who have come with bold proclamations to “troll” more veteran reporters on social media they think are doing Trump wrong. \nThat Gateway correspondent, Lucian Wintrich , is a 28-year-old Pittsburgh native, former New York artist and self-described “brand strategist and digital creative.” He has no previous reporting experience and describes himself as a “libertarian, Goldwaterian conservative.” \nWintrich gained notoriety during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last year when he organized a “Twinks for Trump” exhibit of shirtless gay men wearing red Trump “Make America Great Again” hats. Wintrich collaborated with the former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos on that project. \n“Why am I doing this?” Wintrich told the Post-Dispatch after he was named Gateway Pundit’s Washington correspondent. “The vast majority of reporters my age are blindly liberal and leftist, and that has always bothered me. I do think people around my age bracket, we tend to read each other’s writings. It has created a sort of echo chamber.” \nAt the “Deploraball” of Trump supporters at the National Press Club the night before Trump’s inauguration, Hoft and Wintrich posted a photo of themselves with middle-fingers extended toward a photo of the liberal activist and actor, George Takei, whose photo was on a wall of previous speakers at the club. \nOn his first day on the job, Wintrich told the New York Times that “we will be doing a little trolling of the media in general here.” \nAsked to explain what that means, he told the Post-Dispatch: “My presence alone is trolling there. \n“New media is encroaching on their territory, and I think they will feel threatened,” he said. “That, alone, is sort of accomplishing the trolling goal.” \nSometimes, that encroachment gets heated. Wintrich and a Fox News radio reporter made news earlier this month when they got into a briefing-room shouting match that Wintrich claimed got physical. \nThe daytime drama goes on.
