AP/Sakchai-Lalit, file \nBANGKOK – The Philippines and Thailand want the framework for the code of conduct for claimants in the South China Sea completed this year, as they stressed the need to adhere to international law in resolving maritime disputes. \nThe South China sea dispute was discussed during the meeting here of President Duterte and Thai Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha yesterday. \nDuterte is on a three-day visit to Thailand as part of the Philippines’ preparation for its hosting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit this year. \n“We emphasized the need for the full and effective implementation of the declaration of conduct of countries in the South China Sea and express the determination to complete the framework of the code of conduct in 2017,” Duterte said. \n“We both also stress the need to maintain peace and stability in the region, including the South China Sea,” he added. \nChan-o-cha cited the need to resolve the maritime dispute through international law.   \n“Maintaining peace, stability and security in the South China Sea are in the interest of both countries,” the Thai leader said. \nThe Philippines and Thailand also recognized the need to respect freedom of navigation. \n“We both recognize the need to strengthen ASEAN centrality in the emerging regional architecture,” Duterte said. \nna inked the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to resolve territorial disputes peacefully. However, specific and binding guidelines have not yet been approved. \nLast year, a Hague-based arbitral court ruled that China’s claim, which covers about 90 percent of the South China Sea, has no legal basis. China has refused to recognize the ruling, dismissing it as “a mere piece of paper” and “illegal since day one.” \nDuterte has said he is ready to set aside the arbitral ruling for now to improve the Philippines’ relationship with China. He promised though to raise the issue with the Chinese government within his term. \nThey also vowed to strengthen their defense and economic cooperation. They want to further strengthen the cooperation between their respective militaries and address terrorism and violent extremism, piracy, human trafficking, and illegal drugs. \nThey also witnessed the signing of cooperation agreements on agriculture, tourism, and science and technology. \nDuterte also sought Thailand’s support for the Philippines’ chairmanship of ASEAN this year.
