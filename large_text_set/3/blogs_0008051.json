Chude, counsel to Patrick Areh, the second defendant, had told the court of his intention to discontinue the trial-within-trial, that the court had ordered at the last adjourned date. \nIkoro said that since the court had adjourned for trial-within-trial, he did not come to court with materials to use to cross examine the witness in the trial. \nMba is facing trial on an amended 15-count charge, bordering on N2.9 billion fraud.
