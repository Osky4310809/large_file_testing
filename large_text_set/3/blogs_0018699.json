I would have ended up playing a few games and then spent a great deal of time on the bench as Liverpool were only looking to fill a void for a particular part of their season.\" \nAzmoun, dubbed 'The Iranian Messi' in some quarters following his performances for the national team and Rostov, says he expects to join a major side soon. \nSchweinsteiger was destined to fail at Man Utd \n\"I want to move to a big club to develop as a player and therefore I will time the move with great precision,\" he said. \"I am sure I will be playing for a top European club in the near future.\" \nAzmoun is with the Iran squad for 2018 World Cup qualifiers against Qatar and China on March 23 and 28 respectively.
