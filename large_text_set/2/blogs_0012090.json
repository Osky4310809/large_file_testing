It may be overdone and cliché, but hey, clichés stem from the truth, don't they? And no matter what trends come and go, we can't wait to put away the big coats and pull out our summery floral dresses out of the closet the second spring rolls in. \nFlorals are here to stay, so much that the print ruled the runways all over the world, even for fall-winter collections over the last year. If that's happening globally, how can we let go of them during the season they're made for? To make the argument stronger, we rounded up six recent celebrity looks full of bloom! \n1. When Sonam Kapoor bathed herself in florals by Gucci. \n2. Deepika Padukone in her luxe floral pyjama set by Gucci again. (Gotta love Gucci!) \n3. Huma Qureshi making a strong case in her Zara coordinates. \n4. Malaika's beautiful, floral appliqué dress by Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla is the perfect bridesmaids dress ever! \n5. Why just floral dresses? Athiya Shetty is giving us major goals with her fancy, floral detailed pants. We are already dreaming of these! \n6. Kangana Ranaut's floral nine yards is everything.
