It's a meltdown-causing event.\nPeople have been losing their minds every time something new from the movie is released, whether its a song from the film sung by Ariana Grande or a new trailer .\nAnd now, a clip from the opening of the film has people freaking out once again and this time for multiple reasons. Honestly, the fervor is so great we're concerned some people may not even make it to the film's release on March 17.\nFirst of all, the clip gives us new footage of Emma Watson as Belle, flitting through her town. Everything is beautiful, the costumes are exquisite and Watson puts all of our doubts about her singing to rest with her sweet voice. Just these aspects are enough to cause great excitement.\nBut for those Harry Potter fans out there who forever think of Watson as Hermione Granger, one detail occurs at around 0:25 in the video that may cause your heart to skip a beat.\nSEE ALSO: 'Beauty and the Beast' mashed up with 'Harry Potter' makes a bizarre love story\nBelle spots Monsieur Jean and asks if he has lost something again. \"I believe I have,\" he says. \"The problem is I can't remember what.\"\nUmm. Neveille Longbottom, is that you?\n@girlposts Monsieur Jean needs a remembrall pic.twitter.com/3UkUJGXfvm\n— Jenna (@JennaKramarczyk) February 21, 2017\nUnsurprisingly, Harry Potter fans are astute and they quickly made this same connection.\nWAIT HOLD UP.\nDid they make a fucking Harry Potter reference because I'm dying xD https://t.co/FyFXnVmC5c\n— Becca (@xdragon_riderx) February 21, 2017\nTHE HARRY POTTER REFERENCE DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT CAUSE I SURE DID https://t.co/585P4ILq1S\n— /skout/ (@jjeanlouisee) February 20, 2017\nWhen there's a nod to Harry Potter in a Beauty & the Beast remake and your inner child just CAN'T. https://t.co/UTzZ1yK4oE\n— Ryan Donovan (@rydontweets) February 22, 2017\nTHERE IS A HARRY POTTER REFERENCE IN BEAUTY AND THE BEAST MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.\n— Alex Ankrim (@AlexAnk14) February 22, 2017\nLet's take a step back and also think about the fact that Emma Watson recently connected Hermione and Belle in an interview she did with Elle UK .\n\"For me, Beauty was the perfect, most joyful thing to do,\" she said in the magazine . \"There was something connected about Hermione and Belle.\"\nSomething connected? Did you mean having to deal with the Longbottoms of the world? Because we get it, Emma! We see it now.\nAnd we'll also be taking pen and paper with us to the movie so we can write down all the other Harry Potter references we are now convinced are there. We can't wait.\nBONUS: Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' trailer is setting the bar high for the live-action remake", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/xdragon_riderx/status/834125171573268480", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/dxNslpp4.m3u8", "https://t.co/585P4ILq1S", "https://twitter.com/jjeanlouisee/status/833808862000115712", "https://t.co/3UkUJGXfvm", "https://twitter.com/JennaKramarczyk/status/834020489257418755", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/dxNslpp4.jpg", "https://twitter.com/girlposts", "https://twitter.com/rydontweets/status/834538991500279808", "https://t.co/UTzZ1yK4oE", "https://twitter.com/AlexAnk14/status/834222942137487360", "https://t.co/FyFXnVmC5c"], "published": "2017-02-24T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:51:40.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
