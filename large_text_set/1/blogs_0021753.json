Ford is quoting a top speed of 348 km/h, and claims the engine’s powerband produces 90% of its peak torque from just 3,500 rpm. \nIt also adds that the GT’s engine is the most powerful EcoBoost production engine it has ever made, and that the GT is the “fastest production car ever to wear the Blue Oval badge.” As for other notable digits, the dry weight of the GT is about 1,360 kg, giving it a power to weight ratio of about 2.1 kg/hp. \nIn other areas, the GT also boasts a fully active dynamics system that encompasses both the car’s suspension and aerodynamics , which is “designed to make the car perform with optimum downforce, drag and balance at any speed, creating a faster setup regardless of driver skill level.” \nWhat does it all equate to? Well, Ford brought its GT out to the Calabogie Motorsports Park in Canada to take on established supercar nameplates – the McLaren 675LT and Ferrari 458 Speciale – as part of its 2016 development testing. \nAll contenders were track-prepped with new fluids, fresh tyres and optimal suspension settings before being driven by the same driver in identical track conditions to ensure maximum parity. The result as Ford puts it “speak for themselves,” with the GT setting the fastest lap time of 2:09.8, a full second quicker than the McLaren and 3.1 seconds quicker than the Ferrari. \n“Our expectation has always been that the EcoBoost V6 would perform exceptionally well in the Ford GT – both in terms of power as well as aerodynamic efficiency. We tested and developed this powertrain through the Daytona Prototype race car that ran in IMSA for two seasons, last season racing with Ford GT. We are extremely pleased with how it performs, both on the track and on the road,” said Dave Pericak, global director at Ford Performance. \n“The Ford GT is all about performance. We achieved considerable weight savings with the carbon-fibre architecture. We then reinvested some of that savings into where it counts most – performance, specifically, the active dynamics. The result is an even faster car,” said Raj Nair, executive vice president of global product development and chief technical officer at Ford. \nThose who were lucky enough to purchase a GT will be glad to know that the model already has some racing pedigree to its name, winning at last year’s Le Mans exactly 50 years on from Ford’s 1-2-3 victory at the iconic race back in 1966. \nGALLERY: 2016 Ford GT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T13:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T10:51:15.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
