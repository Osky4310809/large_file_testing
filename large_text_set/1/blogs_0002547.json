Gasp! Kylie talking about her relationship with Tyga. #JennerUpdates pic.twitter.com/0FMhQHpMFZ \nThe piece has Kylie gushing about how she loves to pamper Tyga. However, at one point, Kylie writes, \nMake your sex life fun! Spice things up with lingerie, toys and massages. \nWait, that… that’s it? \nI get that’s kind of private and personal information, but it’s not the end of the world. I think we’re all mature enough in 2017 that the use of sex toys isn’t really that scandalous? \n*giggles, whispers “sex toys,” giggles some more* Well, Kylie all but had a meltdown on Twitter in response. Twitter \nOh, great. Juuust great. *throws phone into a fucking river* Kylie is setting the record straight, saying she neither approved this post, nor wrote the quote she’s talking about. Twitter \nOoh, you just have the gut feeling Kylie’s firing someone over this. Now, here’s where the real kicker comes in. Kylie actually apologized to people who might think these were her words. Twitter \nBut wait… if these weren’t her words, how many of her other posts were written by someone else? \nYou’re telling me that Kylie’s app is potentially written by a series of ghost writers? An app that people have to hear from Kylie in Kylie’s actual words? \nThat’s fucked up. Kylie finished her series of tweets offering up her love to her fans or maybe to Tyga or maybe even to sex toys. Who knows?! Twitter \nNo matter what, one thing’s for certain: \nWe will always love Kylie even if 17 middle-aged wordsmiths might be cranking out her app posts in a smoke-filled writer’s room the likes of which haven’t been seen since “M*A*S*H.” \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
