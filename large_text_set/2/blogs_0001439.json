In the world of comics, there are plenty of famous couples who keep their love alive without resorting to Joker-esque tactics, but fans are still asking to see those relationships come to life on-screen. For shows like Agents of SHIELD , romances have ended with less-than-stellar results, but that doesn’t keep audiences from hoping. And, after recent episodes, fans began to wonder if Daisy Johnson might have a thing for Mack on the show. \nBut, according to one star, there is little more between the two than friendship. \nRecently, TV Line spoke to Chloe Bennet about her role as Daisy, and the site went so far as to ask about the possible Mack romance. Here is what the actress had to say: \n“Oh, no, no. You’re picking up some weird vibes!” \nContinuing, Bennet said, “I love Jason O‘Mara in real life, so I would be more than happy for that, but I don’t think that’s happening. I don’t think Daisy is ready yet. It’s too soon after Lincoln.” \nOf course, fans can understand the heroine’s hesitance to jump back into dating. Daisy cherished her relationship with Lincoln, but the latter tragically sacrificed himself to do away with Hive last season. And, when it comes to Mack, the beefy agent has had his eyes occupied elsewhere thanks to Yo-Yo. \nBut who knows? Maybe Daisy will get out of her dating funk one day and look for another man who can keep up with her. \nYou can check out the synopsis of tonight’s new episode of Agents of SHIELD below: \nAgents Sam and Billy Koenig (Patton Oswalt) are hunted down to get at the Darkhold book, and only Coulson and the team can save them before the clock ticks out. \nAgents of SHIELD stars Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Agent Melinda May, Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson, Iain De Caestecker as Agent Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Agent Jemma Simmons, Henry Simmons as Agent Alphonso “Mack” MacKenzie, and John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe. \nGuest starring are Mallory Jansen as Aida, Patton Oswalt as Koenig, John Pyper-Ferguson as Shockley, Maximilian Osinski as Agent Davis, Artemis Pebdani as L.T.
