Share Save \nIt was only a matter of time before Facebook Messenger would start testing ads , after rumors of its plans to do so leaked nearly a year ago. Earlier today, it announced that users in Australia and Thailand will begin seeing sponsored content in the coming weeks, with the experiment being labeled as a way \"for people and brands to engage on Messenger.\" What this means, really, is that you and your friends should expect to see targeted ads in the app soon -- which won't be hard to miss , judging by the image above. \nFacebook didn't say whether it plans to roll out ads for Messenger globally, only noting that it hopes to \"learn a lot\" from the test. Of course, nothing is free and the social network needs to find ways to benefit from the 1 billion people who use the app, but hopefully that doesn't come at the expense of their experience with the service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:40:52.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
