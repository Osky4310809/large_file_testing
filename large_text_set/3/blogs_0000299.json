Carpio or \"Stonefish\" is President Rodrigo Duterte's ninth grandson and his first as the country's president. Facebook/Christopher Bong Go \n  President Rodrigo Duterte met his newborn grandson \"Stonefish\" on Thursday night at the Davao Doctors Hospital. \nThe proud grandfather is seen beaming with delight in photos shared by Presidential Assistant Christopher “Bong” Go on Facebook. \nStonefish, whose full name is Marko Digong D. Carpio, is the third child of presidential daughter and Davao City Mayor Sara “Inday Sara” Duterte-Carpio with husband Manases Carpio. \nDuterte-Carpio delivered Stonefish, weighing 2.42 kilos or 5.3 pounds, through cesarean section at around 12:56 p.m. on Thursday.   \nThe couple has two other children—a daughter nicknamed \"Sharky\" and a son nicknamed \"Stingray.\" \nLast August 19, Duterte-Carpio announced that she is seven weeks pregnant with triplets. The presidential daughter went on leave upon doctor's advice due to her sensitive condition. \nAlthough physically weak, Duterte-Carpio assured her constituents that her pregnancy would not hamper her responsibilities as mayor. \nThree days after the Roxas night market blast in Davao City, Duterte-Carpio said she lost twins but luckily enough, the other one is “still fighting for life.” The president admitted crying after learning that two of the triplets had died. \nStonefish is Duterte's ninth grandson and his first as Philippine president. — Kristine Daguno-Bersamina  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:50:27.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
