Overton, the subject of a National Geographic short documentary , shares the breadth of his near eleven decade experience. He is the oldest living World War II veteran and has been honored by the military, politicians and celebrities alike. He can remember the end of the first world war and the soldiers from his small town in Bastrop County, Texas, marching home. He would join the army himself in 1940 and fight in the Pacific in places like Iwo Jima and Guam. He would leave the army in 1945 as a corporal. He returned to Texas, built a house, and has been there ever since. He has never used a credit card and has paid cash for everything he’s ever owned. He still has the same truck, a Ford pickup, and still drives. “I may give out but I never give up” says Overton, who spends his days feeding his cats, drinking cup after cup of coffee and attending his local church. “It’s good to have a spiritual life, but you’ve got to live it.” he says. On Veteran’s Day 2013 he met with President Obama in the oval office and then with Governor Rick Perry of Texas. On Memorial Day that year Overton told Fox News he’d spend it “smoking cigars and drinking whiskey-stiffened coffee” which earned him some notoriety on the internet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:57:59.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
