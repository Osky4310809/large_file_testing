The photo that shows Barron Trump riding in a limo with his father, President Donald Trump, won this yearly award for the Washington Post photographer, Jabin Botsford. \nThis award comes from the White House News Photographers Association, which has a contest every February. This year there already seems to be more buzz about the photo that won the award because Barron Trump is the main subject of the picture. Botsford’s photo won first place for the Inauguration 2017 category in the Still Contest for the 2017 Eyes Of History. You can see the award-winning photo in the Facebook post below. \nThis has opened the door for just about everybody to do their own analyzing of this photo, which stirs up more Barron Trump questions today. According to the website Reading the Pictures , “the photo titled “BARRON” (below), might be the most fascinating and provocative choice of all the photo contests this year.” #BREAKING !????

(@Kelly4Trump) February 24, 2017 \nReading the Pictures critic, Michael Shaw, handled this picture with kit gloves, citing –“given the media blackout of children of the president.” Shaw asks “how far can we go in analyzing this acclaimed piece of journalism?” The expression on Barron’s face in contrast to his father’s thumbs-up does entice quite the critique about what you are seeing in the picture. Shaw asks “to what extent is it respectful or safe to tease out the meaning, power and symbolism of the prized scene?” \nOther than looking at the award winning picture and saying, yes, this is Donald Trump and his son Barron, what else can you say without going over that media blackout line? They say that “every picture is worth a thousand words,” and this photo is no different, especially when it comes to Barron’s expression.

(@AlyssaNelsonR) February 23, 2017 \nIn the picture, which was taken on inauguration day, you can see Trump giving a thumbs-up through one window in a limo and there’s Barron looking out another window. Barron’s expression doesn’t seem to flow along the lines of a thumbs-up like his father. Shaw conveys that “the child’s expression could be seen to represent the alienation, the horror even, so many people feel over Trump’s election.” He goes on to say, “Call it a silent scream.” \nOpposing Views suggests that when Shaw goes on to ask “whether Barron is alright,” this brings up memories of the question the suspended Katie Rich was asking on Saturday Night Live. This is not something the media is supposed to be asking about the young son of the president. \nRich’s horrific comment came from her questioning Barron’s “apparent inability” to pay attention to all the activities during Trump’s inauguration. That is when she made that terrible remark regarding Barron, which doesn’t need repeating here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:40:30.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
