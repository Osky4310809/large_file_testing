That means the ABS could ask Tabcorp to pull the ad if it breached any of its own rules. \nBut advertising experts say the lolly giveaway probably doesn't count as an ad. \nIf they're not part of an ad, the beans may still breach NSW legislation that states printed gambling advertising has to include the gambling helpline and website. \nPrinted gambling ads in NSW must include: \nThink! About your choices \nSource: Betting and Racing Regulation . \nThe jellybean packets do not feature these. \nThe legislation is overseen by the the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority. Hack has contacted the Authority for comment. \nJustin Field, a Greens MLC for New South Wales, told Hack three people in Tabcorp shirts were handing out jellybeans at Martin Place this morning. \n\"Most people were getting handed a packet of jellybeans,\" he said. \n\"We know they're going to go in people's bags and be thrown on the table at the end of the day and end up in the hands of kids.\" \n\"This is a new low.\" \n\"Tabcorp has a moral responsibility. I don't think they should need Liquor and Gaming to tell them this isn't an appropriate form of advertising.\" \nTabcorp told Hack the promotion targeted only people aged 25 or over and was only carried out in central Sydney to mark the April horseracing championships. \nIt said the giveaway material also included mints and stress balls and featured only general TAB branding and contained no promotion of odds or direct encouragement to place a bet. 'Jellybeans probably don't breach ASB rules' \nJellybean giveaways probably won't come under the scrutiny of the ASB, according to Dr Lauren Rosewarne, an advertising and media expert and lecturer at University of Melbourne. \n\"This is probably PR, not advertising,\" she said. \nShe said the jellybeans may be classed as ads if each bean had been printed with the Tabcorp logo or a slogan, indicating they were part of a major campaign. \nCBS promoted its lineup by laser-printing the names of shows on eggs. \nSupplied \nThat means the lolly giveaway probably don't breach any advertising rules, although the content of the ad may still breach the trade regulations. \nDr Rosewarne said Tabcorp could have factored the potential $5,500 fine into its budget for the jellybean PR campaign. \n\"Fining in the field of advertising doesn't work,\" she said. \"All companies do is factor it into marketing budget.\" \nShe said the only mechanism that did work was outright banning ads, but there was no public appetite for this kind of censorship. \nAs a result, she said, advertising agencies deliberately skirted the edge of the rules, knowing there would be little consequence for a breach. \nShe described the Tabcorp jellybean campaign, handing out jellybeans to the public, including potentially children, as \"insidious\". \n\"They know what they're doing, they're not idiots,\" she said. \nHack has contacted Tabcorp for comment.
