That's because it needs to dry thoroughly before being stashed away, lest you leave your tool susceptible to mold and bacteria. We've resorted to just leaving ours loose on a countertop, but we've been searching for a more savvy solution. And thanks to one Redditor, we've finally found it.\nIn a post to the MakeupAddiction subreddit , Reddit user wireless_woman showed off two stands she'd purchased for her blending tools that are both precious and practical. \"Two little cuties,\" she shared. As you can see, the stands have bird-like legs, transforming your innocent sponge into the torso of a funky character that wouldn't be out of place in Monsters, Inc. \"I'm actually really tempted to put googly eyes on them,\" she added.\nRelated:\n12 Ways You're Using Your Beautyblender Totally Wrong\nEven better, these little storage options are available for purchase and incredibly affordable.
