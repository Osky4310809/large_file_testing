Here's our list Shares Best Apple Watch apps for 2016 \nUpdate: The best Apple Watch apps list is one we're constantly updating. Here's what's been making our iPhone smartwatch tick. \nThe Apple Watch has now been superseded by the Apple Watch 2 , and yet these much-hyped iPhone smartwatches are just now seeing their true potential through apps and games in 2017 following the Watch OS 3 launch. \nWhy? It's the fact that this is a brand new product category, so while it's one of the best smartwatch options out there, even Apple CEO Tim Cook admits it's still in \"learning mode.\" \nThe number one question we hear from new Apple Watch owners is \"Well, what apps should I download first?\" To make answering that query easier, we devised a thorough best Apple Watch apps list. \nHere are the best apps, going along with our selection of the best apps for Android Wear and the best apps for Pebble . With the right apps, your beautiful timepiece will become so much more. Prev New this week: Yelp Free \nYou’ve probably noticed something of a trend in our favorite apps: they tend to approach their mission by asking what useful things the watch can do rather than trying to cram an entire phone app into that tiny screen, irrespective of whether that’s sane or useful. Yelp is a great example of an app that gets it right. \nWhen you open it you’ll see just four icons: Restaurants, Bars, Coffee & Tea, and Hot & New. Tapping on the one you’re interested in then shows you a list sorted by distance, with the all-important star ratings and average cost listed on top of a photograph. Tap again and you’ll get the opening hours and a map, and of course you can read the reviews too - that’s what Yelp is all about. \nIt’s particularly good for the kind of venues and experiences popular among bright young things in big cities, (the most committed Yelpers), but the database is truly enormous and doesn’t turn into tumbleweed whenever you venture into the countryside. Yelp’s app is very good for finding places in unfamiliar towns, or unfamiliar places in towns you know very well. New this week: The Guardian Free \n“Wouldn’t it be great if you could read an entire newspaper on a screen the size of a postage stamp?” said no-one, ever. That hasn’t stopped people from trying, often with terrible results. So all credit to The Guardian , which has taken a completely different approach that actually works. It’s a news app, but rather than tell you everything it only tells you a little bit. \nRather than deliver a newspaper, The Guardian’s watch app only wants to do one thing: to show you something interesting every time you look at it. In practice that means the app is looking at your preferences in the larger iPhone app and showing you one story that it thinks you’ll be interested in. \nYou’ll see a headline, a small photo and a synopsis, and you can either Force Touch to save the item to your reading list, or use Handoff to open the full item on your phone. \nTrust us, it’s a lot more useful than it sounds. Provided you’ve personalized the main app, the one-shot suggestions do generally fall into the “hmm, that’s interesting” category, and we think it’s a much better approach than some other apps that give you half a headline for a whole bunch of stories. Prev New this week: Philips Hue Free \nSome people bought their Apple Watch to track their fitness. Others, like us, hoped we’d be able to control every appliance by shouting at it. That dream hasn’t quite been achieved yet, but in the meantime we can command our Philips Hue lights with the power of Siri, or access pre-installed lighting effects with the tap of the wrist. \nHue is Philips’ HomeKit-compatible bulb system, enabling you to create light recipes that you can save for easy access. It’s based around a hub that connects to your wireless router, allowing control via phone, tablet or watch. \nIf you plump for the colored bulbs or colored lightstrips you can mix and match the colors and brightness by mood or activity, so you might have warm whites for reading, soft pastels for dining and something spookier for watching horror films. \nThe Watch bit of the app isn’t the most straightforward to set up - once installed you need to create its widgets using the Hue app on your phone - but once you’ve done that you can then tap on the appropriate icon to call up its settings. \nAnd because the Hue setup is HomeKit compatible, it also integrates with Siri. The novelty of asking Siri to turn the lights on or off or to call up a particular ‘light scene’ never really wears off. Prev Foursquare City Guide Free \nFoursquare’s mission has changed somewhat over the years: what started off based around location check-ins and “king of the castle” bragging had to change when Facebook promptly copied the idea. \nRobbed of its raison d’être , these days Foursquare has separated the check-ins from the venue recommendations. ). \nThe main interface of City Guide has five tappable areas: Search, Favorites, Food, Coffee and Nightlife. \nTapping on the appropriate option takes you to a list of venues, but instead of just filtering by distance the app also filters by Foursquare user ratings - so a rating of 9.5 that’s 500m away will appear below a 9.7 that’s 100m further. \nThe list gives you the name, price bracket, average rating and distance for each venue, and if you tap on a venue you’ll see reviews, photos, maps and other key information. The big selling point here is Foursquare’s global reach: it’s a really good app for travellers who don’t want to spend their time in the hotel bar or eating in faceless chain restaurants. Prev UK Bus Checker Free / £2.99 to remove adverts \nWhat makes a good watch app? We think it’s one that tells you exactly what you need to know, when you need to know it, without fuss or fluster. \nAnd that’s what UK Bus Checker does. From the no-nonsense name onwards, it’s a fine example of a focused app - and it’s so good we’re adding in here even though it’s only of use to Brits. \nOpen up the apps and you’ll be staring at four icons and your location, with Favorites showing your saved stops, Nearby the stops around you, Journeys enabling you to plan a trip, and Get Home finding the best way to get you there from here. \nWe use the Favorites one a lot, because it offers real-time data so you know if the number 60A is running late again or if you’ll need to sprint to the bus stop. It includes mapping and points of interest too, so you can use it to find a coffee shop when you’re on foot. \nThe only real downside to UK Bus Checker is that it’s only as good as the data supplied to it, and unfortunately if - like us - you live in an area where the buses are operated by the devil himself and driven by his henchmen, that data isn’t always accurate. \nBut you can say the same about the signs on the bus shelters - that’s the bus company’s fault, not the technology.
