They’re also the ideal sandals if you’re looking to make a statement, especially with the red and blue patterned straps.\nThey are designed with both comfort and utility in mind, and are comprised of patterned webbing straps anchored by cushioned rubber soles. At first glance, it may appear that there’s a lot going on for a pair of sandals, but the straps are designed to provide support for the ankles when walking.\nThe sandals are available for roughly $420 and you can grab a pair over at Mr. Porter , as well as other retailers online.\nElsewhere, the Nike Air Max 1 OG makes a return to celebrate its 30th anniversary.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:13:49.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
