Analysis \nBBC Radio Bristol sports editor Richard Hoskin \n\"Speculation that John Pemberton was leaving Ashton Gate had been doing the rounds in the city for the past 24 hours, and the general feeling is that fans are sad to see him go. \n\"He's been at the club since 2013, assisting Steve Cotterill during a hugely successful promotion campaign in 2015. And, when Cotterill left the club, Pemberton won many admirers for the way he steadied the ship while they searched for his replacement. \n\"This won't help lift the mood of supporters, who have watched their side win only two of their past 21 league matches ahead of the Norwich match. \n\"Bristol City's Championship status is in severe jeopardy, and 'bad news' stories like this can't help the cause.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:00:42.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
