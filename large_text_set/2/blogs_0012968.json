The first full length trailer for Feud just dropped , and though it’s barely two-minutes, we can say with full certainty that literally everyone who is involved with this new FX show will win an Emmy. Or, like six of them because Feud is already on .\nLike American Horror Story , Feud will be an anthology series. Like American Crime Story , Feud will follow real-life events — specifically, real life feuds between some of the world’s biggest names . The first season focuses on the drama between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford on the set of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? and the fact that these two women HATED EACH OTHER. They brought their hatred to the film, and kept it going long after production had wrapped.\nWill we get to see Jessica Lange (playing Joan) and Susan Sarandon (Playing Bette) rocking some fierce 60’s hair styles and threads? Will we get to see them both throw some temper tantrums? Will we be treated to the return of Sally Draper Kiernan Shipka on the small screen? Will this be the most intense television show you’ve ever watched?\n\nAnswer to all of those questions: YAS.\n“They hated each other, and we loved them for it,” Catherine Zeta-Jones (playing actress Olivia de Havilland) coos. “Feuds are never about hate, feds are about pain.” We want to binge Feud roughly a thousands times already. The series premiers on FX on March 5th.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:04:48.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
