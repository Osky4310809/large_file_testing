Signet Classics/Amazon \nThere’s a long tradition of presidents encouraging Americans to read, from JFK’s list of favorite books to Barack Obama’s ConnectED Library Challenge , and it looks like Donald Trump has wasted no time throwing his hat into the ring. Not surprisingly for a Republican, Trump is focusing on the canon, encouraging Americans to revisit George Orwell’s classic novel about totalitarianism, 1984 . And it’s a hit! The Signet Classic edition— only $8.29 right now —is Amazon’s #1 best selling book as of Tuesday night, Open Culture reports . \nAlthough the president has yet to publicly comment on the rollout of what seems to be a nationwide assigned reading plan modeled on programs like One Book, One Chicago , experts have identified its main components as “every single thing Trump and his administration has done since taking office.” Future assignments are expected to include It Can’t Happen Here , The Origins of Totalitarianism , and, for younger readers, Betty Jean Lifton’s 1972 children’s classic Good Night, Orange Monster . \nMatthew Dessem is Brow Beat’s nights and weekends editor and the author of a biography of screenwriter and director Clyde Bruckman .
