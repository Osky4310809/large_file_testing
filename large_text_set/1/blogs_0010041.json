As POLITICO’s Austin Wright and Martin Matishak report , the “emboldened approach” comes as a bombshell CNN report (which had four bylines, including Watergate scribe Carl Bernstein) revealed new details about what intelligence officials presented to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump last week about Russian meddling.\nAmong the information presented: Claims by Russian operatives that they have compromising information on Trump. Per CNN, Trump was also presented with allegations that there was an “exchange of information” during the campaign between his own surrogates and people operating on behalf of the Russian government.\nLawmakers hadn’t really pressed the idea that Trump’s operation and Russia coordinated directly — until a hearing on Tuesday. “The hearing followed Friday's release of an unclassified version of an intelligence community investigation into Russia's interference in the election, which said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence operation to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Trump,” write Austin and Martin.\nDuring the hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden demanded that FBI Director James Comey reveal whether the agency is investigating the alleged ties, saying the American people “have a right to know” before Inauguration Day.\nElsewhere in the transition:\nTOWER TREASURE: Donald Trump misses the campaign trail already. POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt scoops that Trump plans to keep campaign staff in New York even as he assumes the presidency, a “move that represents a sharp break from his predecessors, and one that positions him to begin running for reelection in 2020.”\nFORTIFIED FOR FORTY-FIVE: President Barack Obama is giving a farewell address tonight in Chicago and current and former staff has flocked to Chicago for “reunion-wake-celebration-pep rally.”\nMARATHON SESSION(S): Jeff Sessions talked to lawmakers for a long time at his confirmation hearing today, most notably fighting off charges of racism.\nJUST THE VAX: Donald Trump met with Robert Kennedy Jr., a leading vaccine skeptic; Kennedy says Trump asked him to lead a committee to look at vaccines, but Trump walked that back.\nTEAM OF RIVALS: Donald Trump’s approach to West Wing staffing, which includes having aides compete for his ear, could pose problems.\nBEAR WITH ME: Sen. Lindsey Graham says Donald Trump needs to beware the Russian “teddy bear.”\n‘SOFT SENSUALITY’: That’s what Donald Trump’s top inauguration organizer, Tom Barrack, is promising for the big day.\nAnd there you have it, you’re caught up on the the Trump transition. We’re 9 days away from President-elect Donald Trump dropping “elect” from his title.
