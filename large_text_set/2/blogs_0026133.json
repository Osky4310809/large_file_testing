The crash happened on Saturday at about 6:45 p.m. at the Krewe of Endymion parade in the Mid-City section of New Orleans. The suspect is in custody, but their motive if any is unknown at this time. Terrorism is not suspected, but drunk driving could very well be. \nOne officer struck, 21 people injured (several in critical condition) after car crashed into people during Endymion parade in Mid-City @wdsu pic.twitter.com/yTC9nP6l3i \n— Fletcher Mackel (@FletcherWDSU) February 26, 2017 \nWitness: Truck plowed into crowd at Endymion parade.
