He was replaced by Mickelson's brother, Tim, who was following the group in case Mackay wasn't able to finish the round. \n“[Mickelson] has only had three caddies, his father-in-law, Bones and me, and I’m retired,” said Mickelson's manager Steve Loy , who struggled to remember the last time Mackay wasn’t on Mickelson’s bag during an official Tour event. \nKevin Kisner’s caddie, Duane Bock, was also slowed by a stomach virus on Day 2, but also planned to work despite his condition.
