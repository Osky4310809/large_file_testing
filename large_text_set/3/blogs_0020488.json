Almost… \nThe longtime Trump supporter was on Sean Hannity’s radio show on Tuesday where she in no uncertain terms expressed her displeasure at the president’s support of the GOP House Obamacare replacement bill, Trump’s push for tax cuts and increased military spending. \n“He wasn’t elected by Goldman Sachs. He got 1% of their vote. He wasn’t elected by the donor class,” said the author of “In Trump we Trust.”“He’s moving money from one swamp to the other.” Ann Coulter on Hannity radio: \"This is beginning to look like every other administration. He's moving money from one swamp to the another.\" pic.twitter.com/lcKTF20hsE \nAfter the radio spot, Coulter took to Twitter and continued the assault. \nOn Trump’s support of RyanCare: Could some investigative reporter write a piece explaining why Ryan is so hellbent on this deeply unpopular healthcare bill? \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 We did the tough thing! We passed an unpopular bill! \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter)   Ann Coulter fires a warning shot @RealDonaldTrump over RyanCare and tax cuts \nOn tax cuts: GOP: When did you get the sense that Americans are clamoring for a tax cut to help the “job creators”? \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 Only 50% of people even pay taxes! \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 \"Job creators\" aren’t popular right now. They’re creating jobs in Indonesia and jobs for lobbyists. \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 TRUMP DIDN’T RUN ON CUTTING TAXES! \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 NO ONE SAID CUTTING TAXES WAS TOP PRIORITY! Even businesses would prefer cutting regulations, red tape and trial lawyers. \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 \nOn the GOP corporate agenda: The only thing that got the GOP this win that voters thought Trump was going to abandon this crazy corporatist agenda. \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 GOP response to Trump's victory has been to double-down on all the ugly unpopular policies that make GOP hated. \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 GOP has to get working class votes, or they’re just handing it to social justice warriors. \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 \nSummary here: I’d love to pay less in taxes. THAT ISN’T THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. Bigger: No jobs, no health care, no wall, immigrant crime & welfare… \n— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 22, 2017 \nWhat do you think? Is Coulter right that President Trump has abandoned what won him the presidency?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:28:51.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
