It was a good experience for the boys. \n\"A game like this is not easy to make exciting. We had a young side so that is difficult. \n\"We can do better and, if we do better, then we have a good chance of making the next round.\" \nKlopp felt a lack of patience was what prevented his young team from sealing a place in the fourth round. \nHe told BT Sport: \"It is not a result we wished for but it is not frustrating - that is football. Plymouth deserved the draw and the rematch. \n\"We started well, we played football but then we lost patience too early and tried to force it. \n\"This team could have played much better. Now we go to Plymouth for the first time in my life - all good. \n\"I don't know how many people live in Plymouth but it felt like the whole of Plymouth was in the 18-yard box. \n\"We needed to stay cool and patient. That is the biggest challenge in football when you are playing against a deep-lying defensive side. \n\"I made the decision to make changes and name a young side - that's life.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T00:21:39.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
