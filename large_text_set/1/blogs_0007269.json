slot machines in Tanzaku Quarters . She takes this as a sign that something bad is about to happen and makes immediate plans to leave the city, but Shizune convinces her to visit a local castle before they go. While they're there, the castle is destroyed by one a snake , Orochimaru 's way of saying hello. Tsunade immediately notices the damage to his arms and, guessing he wants her to heal them, preemptively refuses. Orochimaru's assistant, Kabuto Yakushi , explains that they've tried all other options and that only Tsunade can help. She asks how his arms were damaged, to which Orochimaru responds that the damage was received while he killed Hiruzen Sarutobi . Tsunade becomes enraged and threatens to kill Orochimaru, but he piques her interest when he offers to revive Nawaki and Dan Katō . \nTsunade asks what he would do if his arms were restored. Orochimaru replies that he would destroy Konohagakure , which is what he was trying to do when his arms were damaged in the first place. Shizune tries to convince Tsunade to help her kill Orochimaru and Kabuto, but they decide to leave instead, giving Tsunade a week to decide. While having dinner later, they are found by Jiraiya . Jiraiya asks her to become the Fifth Hokage , which she refuses, upsetting Jiraiya's companion, Naruto Uzumaki . Tsunade recognises Naruto as the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails and starts remarking on what a waste it was for the Fourth Hokage to give his life saving Konoha from the Nine-Tails. She reflects further that all the past Hokage have wasted their lives for the village and concludes that only a fool would ever want the title. Tsunade and Naruto face-off. \nNaruto, who has his own dreams of being Hokage, is enraged and tries to attack Tsunade. Jiraiya holds him back, but Tsunade agrees to fight with him outside the restaurant. Tsunade easily outmatches Naruto using only one finger for offence and defence, but she's unsettled by how similar his resolve is to Nawaki and Dan's. While she's distracted by this, Naruto attacks her with an incomplete Rasengan , which she once again avoids using only a finger. She berates Jiraiya for teaching Naruto the Rasengan at all, declaring it cruel to let someone as untalented as him believe he can master something as complicated as the Rasengan. Naruto vows to complete it in three days, prompting Tsunade to make a wager: if Naruto can master the Rasengan in a week, she'll give him the First Hokage's necklace ; if he can't, she gets his wallet . Naruto agrees. \nTsunade and Jiraiya have drinks later. Jiraiya guesses that Orochimaru made some offer to Tsunade. He doesn't ask for details about the offer, but he promises to personally kill her if she does anything to endanger Konoha. She claims not to care about the village, so Jiraiya reminds her of how important the village was to Nawaki and Dan; he further notes how similar they, particularly Nawaki, are to Naruto. Tsunade keeps tabs on Naruto as he trains, but by the end of the week he has failed to master the Rasengan and the intense training leaves him bedridden. Shizune pleads with Tsunade not to accept Orochimaru's deal and, when this fails, she tries to use force, prompting Tsunade to knock her out. She meets with Jiraiya again and drugs his drink, knocking him out and, when he wakes up the next morning, making it difficult for him to use his chakra . Tsunade preparing to \"heal\" Orochimaru. \nTsunade meets with Orochimaru and agrees to heal his arms on the condition that he leave Konoha alone. Orochimaru agrees. She approaches him, apparently to heal him, but Kabuto notices at the last moment that she has killing intent and stops her. Orochimaru questions why she would deceive him, to which she replies that she knew he was lying about sparing Konoha. Although she desperately wants to see Nawaki and Dan again, she knows they wouldn't want to be brought back at the cost of Konoha's safety, something Naruto has reminded her of. Orochimaru and Kabuto state that they'll force her to heal his arms, causing her to attack them. They draw her away from the city and Kabuto, a medic-nin , tries neutralising her, but she heals all the debilitating damage he does. Unable to stop her through conventional means, Kabuto slits his own wrists and coats her with his blood, paralyzing her due to her phobia. Tsunade protected by Naruto. \nJiraiya, Shizune, and Naruto eventually arrive to help. Shizune looks after Tsunade as she shudders from the blood while Jiraiya fights Orochimaru and Naruto fights Kabuto. Naruto is quickly defeated by Kabuto, as is Shizune when she tries to face him afterwards. Kabuto approaches Tsunade and tries to restrain her, which she is unable to fend off in her condition. Naruto stops him and attacks with an incomplete Rasengan, but misses, causing Kabuto to start commenting on his lack of talent, just as Tsunade did the week before. Naruto persists and, after making a shadow clone to help him, he is able to strike Kabuto with a perfected Rasengan. Kabuto is defeated, but as his last act he severs Naruto's heart muscles. Tsunade tries healing him, fearing that he'll die just like Nawaki and Dan did. She succeeds, and in a brief moment of regained consciousnesses Naruto claims the necklace he's won. Tsunade defeats Orochimaru. \nOrochimaru decides to kill Naruto and attacks with his Sword of Kusanagi . Tsunade uses her body to block the attack, her way of protecting Naruto, Konoha's future Hokage. Orochimaru keeps trying to attack him, which Tsunade keeps using her body to block. Her resolve to protect Naruto eventually overcomes her fear of blood, allowing her to go on the offensive: she kicks Orochimaru, activates Creation Rebirth to heal all the damage she's received, and declares her acceptance of the position of Fifth Hokage. She, Jiraiya, and Orochimaru each summon Katsuyu , Gamabunta , and Manda , respectively. When Manda proves too elusive for Katsuyu and Gamabunta, Tsunade uses Gamabunta's sword to pin Manda to the ground with his mouth shut. She then delivers a sequence of punches to Orochimaru's face, forcing him to escape with Kabuto; before he leaves, he warns that he has other ways of fixing his arms. \nHaving used so much chakra during the fight, Tsunade's younger transformation fades after the battle, but it is restored before Naruto wakes up. When he hears about what happened while he was unconscious, Naruto expresses his concern that she isn't qualified to be Fifth Hokage, being vastly inferior to Hiruzen. Tsunade challenges him to a fight and once again outmatches him using a single finger. Rather than defeat him, however, she kisses his forehead to symbolise her faith in his achieving his dreams, just as she once did for Nawaki and Dan. Sasuke Recovery Mission \nMain article: Sasuke Recovery Mission Tsunade as the Fifth Hokage. \nWhen they get back to Konoha, the villagers start making preparations to officially place Tsunade into office. Before that can happen, Naruto has Tsunade heal the damage to the minds of Kakashi Hatake and Sasuke Uchiha . She also looks at the damage to Rock Lee 's spine; although she's the only one who can fix it, she confesses that there's a fifty percent chance he wouldn't survive the procedure and recommends he give up on life as a ninja. After thinking it over, Lee tells her plainly that being a ninja is his dream, which she cannot argue with. In the anime, Tsunade tries to improve his chances of survival by studying one of Kabuto's jutsu , and in doing so she improves Lee's odds to 58%. Lee ultimately survives the procedure. \nBeing Hokage comes with a heavy workload, especially in the aftermath of Orochimaru's Konoha Crush , which left the village understaffed. For this reason, when Tsunade is informed that Sasuke has defected to Orochimaru, Shikamaru Nara - only recently promoted to chūnin - is the highest ranking ninja she can assign to lead the Sasuke Recovery Team ; she allows him any genin he can recruit for the mission, though recommends Naruto's inclusion. After the Recovery Team leaves, Tsunade is notified of the Konoha Special Mission Platoon 's defeat by the Sound Four , Sasuke's escorts. Having already suspected that a team of genin wouldn't be enough, she requests Sunagakure 's support so that Orochimaru, a mutual enemy of both villages, can't gain Sasuke's Sharingan . She is also informed that Lee, despite still recovering from his surgery, has also gone off to lend support. \nDespite the best efforts of the Recovery Team, Lee, and Suna's Three Sand Siblings , they are unable to stop Sasuke from joining forces with Orochimaru. Tsunade sends the Medic Corps to retrieve the Recovery Team's members and tend to their injuries; Tsunade, by studying the Nara Clan Medical Encyclopaedia , is able to cure Chōji Akimichi of the Three Coloured Pills ' side-effects. Tsunade is later approached by Sakura Haruno , who asks to be taught medical ninjutsu . Sensing that Sakura has something she wants to protect (Naruto and Sasuke), Tsunade agrees. Mizuki Tracking Mission \nMain article: Mizuki Tracking Mission Jiraiya makes plans to take Naruto away from the village to train him. In the anime, Naruto must remain in Konoha while Jiraiya is off investigating and it is up to Tsunade to keep him preoccupied with other missions so that he won't go after Sasuke by himself. When, during one of these missions, the Legendary Stupid Brothers escape from prison, Tsunade convinces them to surrender with a quick display of genjutsu and her strength. The Appearance of Strange Visitors \nMain article: The Appearance of Strange Visitors In the anime, Tsunade learns that Rock Lee and Might Guy are being impersonated by Mondai and Potcha . Deciding to have fun with the two, Tsunade pretends to believe their disguises and has them do many arduous tasks for her. The workload horrifies the two and eventually drives them away from the village. Interlude In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths \nMain article: In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths Sakura progresses rapidly under Tsunade's tutelage. In the anime, Ino Yamanaka also asks to train with Tsunade. From seeing the rivalry that exists between Sakura and Ino and how that competition drives them each to do better, Tsunade agrees. [45] However, she teaches Ino only medical ninjutsu and not the additional skills she teaches Sakura, believing it would be better for Ino to focus on her clan's hiden jutsu . [46] \nAbout two years after Naruto leaves Konoha to train with Jiraiya, Tsunade proposes to Suna's Fifth Kazekage that their two villages hold a Chūnin Exam . Publicly, the exam will demonstrate the alliance that now exists between their two villages. Secretly, the exam will hopefully draw out Akatsuki , who are after jinchūriki like the Kazekage. The Kazekage agrees and the two villages split responsibilities for the exams. She sends Kakashi Hatake to invite Amegakure to the exams with instructions to investigate rumours that Ame's leader, Hanzō , has been overthrown. [47] Ame accepts the invitation and Kakashi is unable to uncover anything, but both are convinced that something unusual is happening in Ame. \nThe first stage of the exams are completed in Konoha without incident. Before the examinees and proctors relocate to Suna for the second stage, Tsunade warns the Konoha personnel to be alert to attacks on the Kazekage. [48] The Kazekage is indeed attacked during the second stage, forcing the exams to be cancelled prematurely. Performance reports on the remaining participants are sent to their respective villages to decide who will be promoted to chūnin; Tsunade promotes the members of Team 8 , Team 10 , and Team Guy . She also promotes Neji Hyūga to jōnin because of his role in protecting the Kazekage. [49] Part II Kazekage Rescue Mission \nMain article: Kazekage Rescue Mission Tsunade is informed of Naruto's return to Konoha after two-and-a-half years of training. She shares this news with Sakura and together they welcome him back. Tsunade has Naruto and Sakura reform Team 7 under Kakashi's leadership. While trying to find a mission to send Team 7 on that Naruto won't complain about, Tsunade receives a report that Suna's Fifth Kazekage has been kidnapped by Akatsuki . Tsunade decides to send Team 7 to lend assistance in the Kazekage's rescue in full awareness that Akatsuki wants to capture Naruto too. She isn't initially concerned, but when she suddenly wins the lottery she takes this as a bad sign and sends Team Guy to provide additional support. \nA few days later they receive news that the Kazekage was successfully rescued and that Teams 7 and Guy will be returning to Konoha. Shizune questions the wisdom of sending Naruto into battle with Akastuki, to which Tsunade replies that, because both Naruto and the Kazekage are jinchūriki , Naruto was the single best person for the mission. Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission \nMain article: Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission When she gets back to Konoha, Sakura shares intel she's received of an opportunity to meet with a spy in Orochimaru's ranks, what may serve as an opportunity to find Sasuke Uchiha. Kakashi is left bedridden after the mission in Suna, requiring that new members be assigned to Team 7 to go meet the spy. Shizune once again questions Naruto's inclusion on the team, believing it would be safer to keep him in Konoha. Tsunade insists that Naruto is one of the few people she can trust with the mission with absolute certainty, and that besides it's a personal matter for him and he wouldn't allow himself to be excluded. \nTsunade is shortly afterwards summoned before the Konoha Council , with whom Shizune has shared her concerns and who also believe that Tsunade is deploying Naruto irresponsibly. Tsunade repeats her earlier reasoning, adding that Akatsuki will inevitably come for Naruto, and that if he keeps getting sent out on missions it will make it more difficult for Akatsuki to locate him. The Konoha Council relents after Tsunade promises to be held solely responsible in the event that her decisions and/or Naruto's capture endanger Konoha. They do, however, insist on including one of Danzō Shimura 's underlings ( Sai ) on this new Team 7, which Tsunade agrees to. Tsunade also assigns an Anbu , codenamed \" Yamato \", to lead Team 7, partly so that he can keep an eye on Sai, but also because his wood release will help Naruto keep the Nine-Tails under control. \nAlthough the new Team 7 does indeed meet Sasuke, they fail in bringing him back to Konoha. Naruto and the others are not deterred, however, and vow to to try again, which Tsunade approves. Twelve Guardian Ninja \nMain article: Twelve Guardian Ninja In the anime, Tsunade sends Team 7 to investigate some grave robberies near the Fire Temple . When they return, they report that the robbers , whoever they are, have a seeming interest in the graves of members of the Twelve Guardian Ninja . Because Sai was injured during the investigation, the Fire Temple allows Sora to fill in for him; Tsunade receives a confidential message that Sora's past and unusual powers pose a risk to the Fire Temple. Meanwhile, Tsunade has Danzō taken into custody on the suspicion that he is betraying Konoha to Amegakure . While she interrogates Danzō's apparent Ame-contact, the Konoha Council informs her that the man is a double-agent who has reported that the grave robbers may be after Sora. \nThe councillors recommend that Sora be either confined or eliminated. While Tsunade tries to decide what to do, Sora attacks her, but he is driven off by the arrival of Shizune and Naruto. The grave robbers soon afterwards arrive in Konoha, erecting a giant barrier around the village while earthen zombies attack. While most of Konoha's forces go on the defence, Tsunade sends Asuma Sarutobi to retrieve Sora. Sora eventually starts rampaging through the village with the Nine-Tails' chakra he has, and Tsunade prepares to confront him, but Naruto ends up dealing with it. Once the grave robbers are all defeated, Tsunade pardons Sora for his actions and allows him to leave Konoha. Akatsuki Suppression Mission \nMain article: Akatsuki Suppression Mission Tsunade finishes Kakuzu's autopsy. \nTsunade receives increasing reports of Akatsuki activity in other countries. She can't do anything until they enter the Land of Fire , but nevertheless starts making preparations. Once she receives news of Akatsuki's attack on the Fire Temple , Tsunade mobilises Twenty Platoons to find the Akatsuki members, capture them if possible, and, if capture is impossible, to eliminate them. Although one of the Twenty Platoons is able to find the Akatsuki members ( Hidan and Kakuzu ), both elude capture and Asuma Sarutobi is killed. A funeral is held in Konoha while the remaining Twenty Platoons continue the search. \nAsuma's students on Team 10 leave Konoha to join the search and avenge him, which Tsunade tries to stop, citing among other reasons that they need a fourth member. Kakashi volunteers to accompany them, and Tsunade is forced to relent. Tsunade is aware that they'll need backup and starts looking for candidates; she has Sakura tell Naruto that, if he would like to go, he'll first need to complete the new jutsu he's been working on. He does indeed complete it and the Akatsuki members are ultimately defeated. Tsunade afterwards performs an autopsy on Kakuzu's body, examining the damage that Naruto's new Rasenshuriken did to it. From the cellular damage Kakuzu received, Tsunade concludes that the Rasenshuriken is as dangerous to Naruto as it is to his opponents and should therefore not be used again. Three-Tails' Appearance \nMain article: Three-Tails' Appearance In the anime, Tsunade receives a dying Anbu's report about one of Orochimaru's bases. She puts Kakashi in charge of Team 8 and sends them to investigate. Because the mission has the chance of meeting Sasuke, Tsunade tries to keep Naruto from finding out about it. He finds out anyway, so Tsunade allows him and the rest of Team 7 to provide backup. Their teams later report encountering the Three-Tails , which Tsunade decides must be dealt with to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. She sends them instructions for a seal to place on the Three-Tails, some Konoha personnel to help perform the seal, as well as part of Katsuyu to provide additional assistance. Orochimaru's forces repeatedly interfere with the sealing, so Tsunade has some Anbu take over the sealing while the others return to Konoha. She later loses contact with the Anbu and the Three-Tails disappears, leading Tsunade to suspect Akatsuki's involvement. Itachi Pursuit Mission \nMain article: Itachi Pursuit Mission Jiraiya visits Tsunade and reports rumours that Orochimaru has been killed by Sasuke. They share these rumours with Naruto and Sakura, who suspect that Sasuke is making moves against his brother, Itachi Uchiha of Akatsuki. Naruto proposes that they try to locate Itachi so that they can, in turn, find Sasuke. Despite how unsuccessful previous attempts to capture Akatsuki members have been, Tsunade approves the formation of a combined Eight Man Squad to find Itachi. Tsunade talks with Jiraiya. \nJiraiya visits Tsunade later with news that he's discovered the location of Akatsuki's leader, though he refuses to go into more detail until she meets him for drinks. While having saké, Jiraiya shares news of Amegakure's ongoing civil war, which the Akatsuki leader is rumoured to be behind. Because Amegakure is in a delicate political situation, Jiraiya must infiltrate the village by himself to confirm before Konoha can take direct action. Tsunade feels guilty for always relying on him to do dangerous work like this and reflects on happier times, before Orochimaru's apparent death and when he was still their friend. As Jiraiya prepares to leave, Tsunade instructs him to be sure to come back alive, fearing what his death might do to her. \nLater, Shizune senses that Tsunade is worried about Jiraiya and tries to reassure her that he'll be fine. Tsunade replies he won't be back, which is a new tactic she's trying: she's betting on the one thing she doesn't want to have happen, relying on her bad luck to prevent her bet from coming true. Six-Tails Unleashed \nMain article: Six-Tails Unleashed In the anime, Konoha receives reports of an attack on the Tsuchigumo clan and, as a consequence, their forbidden technique is at risk. Because the returning Eight Man Squad is closest to the Tsuchigumo clan's location, Tsunade sends Katsuyu to intercept them and give them their assignment to protect the Tsuchigumo. Pain's Assault \nMain article: Pain's Assault Fukasaku , a former teacher of Jiraiya, reports to Tsunade that Jiraiya died while investigating the Akatsuki leader, Pain . Tsunade summons Naruto to her office so that Fukasaku can also tell him the news, who they expect will have greater difficulty. Naruto is indeed upset and blames Tsunade for his death, saying she should not have let him go. Sakura tries to stop him from storming out, but Tsunade lets him go. Tsunade makes investigating Pain's identity using the information Jiraiya gathered top priority: she has Shizune examine the Animal Path 's body; she has Ibiki Morino interrogate the prisoner Jiraiya captured; she has Shikamaru Nara decipher the coded message Jiraiya left behind. When Shikamaru tries objecting to the assignment, Tsunade ignores him, leaves, and, once she's alone, she cries for Jiraiya. \nKnowing that Pain will be coming for him, Naruto goes to Mount Myōboku to train with Fukasaku. The investigations into Pain's identity continue, but none are not completed prior to Pain's assault on Konoha. Tsunade sends orders for Naruto to be recalled to Konoha, but she's stopped by the Konoha Council, who feel that Naruto is safest where he is. Tsunade becomes angry with both councillors and berates them for lacking even the barest faith in Naruto's ability to save himself. The councillors are affronted by how she handles them and leave, but tell her to do what she wants. Tsunade heads to the roof of the Hokage Residence and summons Katsuyu, who she instructs to divide and attach to all of Konoha's villagers so that Tsunade can heal them remotely . Tsunade heals Konoha's villagers via Katsuyu. \nAs Katsuyu's divisions spread throughout the village, Tsunade starts to fully appreciate the extent of the damage that Pain's attack is doing. When she senses, through Katsuyu, that Kakashi has died, she destroys a nearby spire out of frustration. Pain's Deva Path eventually finds her. As her Anbu-bodyguards move in to protect her, Tsunade recognises the Deva Path as an orphan that Jiraiya once trained. The Deva Path asks Tsunade where Naruto is, which she refuses to reveal. The Deva Path blames Konoha's past actions for the contemporary dire state of the world and Tsunade's refusal to cooperate with Akatsuki for the attack on the village. Tsunade is unmoved, but Pain is able to able to find out where Naruto is through other means. Before leaving, the Deva Path states it will show Konoha the pain that the rest of the world has known for too long. Tsunade in her weakened state. \nThe Deva Path leaps into the air and Tsunade tries to follow. As it destroys Konoha with Shinra Tensei , Tsunade transfers all of her chakra to Katsuyu to use in keeping the villagers safe. When the dust clears, Tsunade finds the village gone. She confronts the Six Paths of Pain and vows to personally defeat them. The Asura Path attacks her, which Naruto, newly returned, destroys in order to save her. Naruto asks Tsunade to trust Pain's defeat to him and has Gamakichi take Tsunade to Sakura. Having done all that she can and with her chakra gone, Tsunade's youthful transformation fades and she falls into a coma. Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown \nMain article: Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown Tsunade comes out of her coma. \nAfter Tsunade regains consciousness many days later, she is immediately embraced by Shizune. As she eats to replenish her chakra reserves, Tsunade is told of all that's happened while she's been unconscious: Naruto's victory over Pain; Tobi of Akatsuki's declaration of a Fourth Shinobi World War ; the formation of the Allied Shinobi Forces . Kakashi discusses these matters with her, and also thanks her for waking up in time so that he would not need to made her replacement as Hokage. Once she's done eating, she convenes a war council to discuss Konoha's strategies for the coming war and any preparations that will need to be made. \nA few days later, Tsunade travels to Kumogakure to meet with the other heads of the Alliance and discuss topics of broader importance. Chief among these is what to do with Naruto and Killer B , whose capture Tobi started the war for. The Alliance's other leaders have already decided to send them into seclusion, which Tsunade strongly disagrees with, believing they would be invaluable on the battlefield. The Fifth Kazekage quickly disagrees, reminding her that Naruto has the tendency to be reckless for his friends, which in turn would place him too much at risk. Knowing she was overruled, Tsunade reluctantly agrees and Naruto and B are sent to the Island Turtle . In the anime, after the meeting with the other heads of the Alliance she requested that B teach Naruto to achieve control over the Nine-Tails in the event that they would have to be deployed, which A approved. As they move on to other matters, Tsunade takes particular interest in equipping the Logistical Support and Medical Division with enough supplies. Power \nMain article: Power In the anime, Tsunade sends Team 7 to investigate the massacre of the Tonika Village . When Team 7 reports Kabuto Yakushi 's use of the Impure World Reincarnation , Tsunade sends them all available backup. Paradise Life on as Boat \nMain article: Paradise Life on a Boat In the anime, Tsunade sends Sakura to Benisu Island to collect medicinal herbs for the war effort. She later refuses Konohamaru Sarutobi 's request to join the Allied Shinobi Forces. Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation \nMain article: Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation Most of the Alliance's leaders head to the battlefield when the war begins, but Tsunade and the Fourth Raikage remain at the Allied headquarters to discuss tactics, coordinate troop movements, and process new intel. On the first night of fighting, they receive reports that Naruto and B have escaped the Island Turtle. The Raikage takes Tsunade with him to head them off; she leaves behind one of Katsuyu's divisions in case she needs to be contacted about anything. Tsunade places her faith in Naruto and B. \nOnce they locate Naruto and B, the Raikage blocks their progress and tries to convince them to return to the Island Turtle. Naruto implores Tsunade to let them pass, but she explains that she must do what is in the best interest of the entire Allied Shinobi Forces. Naruto's continuing obstinance prompts the Raikage to decide to kill him so that Akatsuki can't capture him. Tsunade cannot allow this and steps in, observing that Naruto's new Nine-Tails Chakra Mode indicates his unprecedented control over the Nine-Tails, something that may never be replicated in future jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails. The best course, she argues, is to let Naruto use his new power to try and win the war. The Raikage is not openly convinced by Tsunade's, B's, or Naruto's words and appears willing to fight, but when Naruto is finally able to get past him the Raikage doesn't pursue. \nWhen Tsunade and the Raikage return to headquarters they are informed that the White Zetsu Army is cultivated from the DNA of Hashirama Senju . Tsunade is upset by the continued use of her grandfather's abilities and what else Tobi may have used them for, but believes Naruto may be able to root out Zetsus that have infiltrated the Allied Forces. Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax \nMain article: Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax The five Kage confront Madara. \nNaruto, using shadow clones , does indeed help defeat the Zetsu Army, finding those that are disguised, defeating those that aren't, and helping capture any remaining reincarnated forces. The apparent victory is cut short by the sudden appearance of the reincarnated Madara Uchiha , who proceeds to decimate the Fourth Division . Wishing to join the battle, Tsunade has Mabui transfer her to the site of Madara's battle with the Fourth Division, using Creation Rebirth to heal the damage that the transfer does to her body. The Raikage joins her and they arrive in time to save the Fifth Kazekage and Third Tsuchikage from Madara's attack. Tsunade heals them and, after being joined by the Fifth Mizukage , the Five Kage face off with Madara. Confident they can defeat him, they tell one of Naruto's shadow clones to entrust Madara to them and to go defeat Tobi elsewhere. Tsunade attacking Madara. \nTsunade initially takes a supplementary role during the battle, healing the other Kage's injuries and replenishing their chakra as needed. She is surprised when Madara is able to use her grandfather's wood release , which they eventually discover to be due to a cloned graft of Hashirama's face that has been implanted in Madara's body. Madara senses that Tsunade is descended from Hashirama and decides to kill her first because she is so much weaker than her ancestor. She acknowledges that she did not inherit all of Hashirama's natural gifts, but she does have his Will of Fire , which drove her to create the Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique . After activating the technique, she joins the other Kage in attacking him. Madara is unimpressed, but Tsunade is nevertheless able to punch through his body, giving the Kazekage a chance to try and seal him. The Kage against Madara's wood clones. \nMadara eludes capture and uses Susanoo 's sword to stab Tsunade. Madara assumes she's dead, but Tsunade removes the sword from her body and attacks him with it, convincing him that maybe she did indeed inherit something from Hashirama. He in fact admits that all the Kage have posed him some challenge, but claims that it's because they outnumber him five-to-one; in order to make things \"fair\", he creates twenty-five wood clones , five for each of the Kage to fight. The wood clones each use Susanoo and fight the Kage into the night. Despite the superior forces against them, the Kage are able to combine forces against the original Madara, impressing him enough to use Susanoo's \"Complete Body\" form. Before he can use it to destroy the Kage, the Impure World Reincarnation is released and Madara's soul starts returning to the Pure Land . Tsunade sees Dan again. \nMadara uses the remaining moments before his soul departs trying to finish off the Kage. Tsunade takes responsibility for blocking his attacks, expecting that her Creation Rebirth will heal the damage, but she runs out of chakra and is left at Madara's mercy. She is saved by Dan Katō 's Spirit Transformation Technique , his soul having also been released from the Impure World Reincarnation. Tsunade uses the little time that they have apologising to him for abandoning his dreams for so many years after he died, but that she now tries to keep his dreams alive in her capacity as Hokage. He thanks her for continuing his dream, but tells her that the greatest service she can do to him is to stay alive, as she herself is his dream. He kisses her forehead before vanishing and transfers all of his chakra to her. Although Tsunade is rejuvenated, Madara has used this time removing the Impure World Reincarnation's user's control over him, thus allowing him to stay. Tsunade summons Katsuyu in her injured state. \nNow free to do what he wants, Madara decides he's lost interest in the Kage and states his intentions to go after Naruto. The Kage try to stop him and thus fulfil their promise to Naruto, but Madara defeats them all and leaves them near death. Tsunade, despite being bisected in the battle, is able to summon Katsuyu. She asks Katsuyu to bring the other Kage closer to her so that she can try and save their lives. Tsunade is later found by Orochimaru, Suigetsu Hōzuki , and Karin . Tsunade has used almost all of her chakra on the other Kage and now lacks the energy to even speak. After assuring Katsuyu that he wants to help, Orochimaru has Karin replenish Tsunade's chakra and has Suigetsu assist Katsuyu with putting Tsunade's halves back together. Tsunade reluctantly thanks Orochimaru once she's restored and notes a change in him, a change that might have saved Jiraiya had it happened sooner. Orochimaru departs, leaving Tsunade to finish healing the Kage. Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki \nMain article: Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki Sakura and Tsunade work together. \nOnce all the Kage are healed, the Kazekage transports them to where the Allied Forces are fighting; along the way, Katsuyu informs them of what's been happening up until now. As they near the battlefield, a reincarnated Hashirama Senju contacts all the Allied powers. After briefly saying hello to Tsunade, Hashirama reveals the purpose of the God Tree recreation now looming over them: to cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi . Much of the infantry is thrown into disarray from fear of what will happen, but when the Kage finally arrive they rally their forces against the God Tree. Tsunade locates Sakura and teams up with her to summon a large segment of Katsuyu, which dissolves across the battlefield so that Tsunade and Sakura can constantly rejuvenate everybody as they fight. \nAlthough they aren't able to cut down the God Tree, the Allies are able to help Naruto defeat Tobi, real name Obito Uchiha . Naruto leaves to fight Madara, leaving the rest of the Allied Forces to fight another Zetsu . Tsunade lacks the chakra necessary to participate in the fight, much less continue performing medical ninjutsu. For this reason, when the Kazekage brings Naruto to her in need of emergency life support, Tsunade sends Sakura to help him. Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes \nMain article: Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes Tsunade trapped in the Infinite Tsukuyomi. \nDespite the Allied Forces' efforts, they are unable to stop Madara from casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi, trapping the world in a dream. Tsunade dreams of a Konoha where Dan is Hokage, where Nawaki and Jiraiya are still alive, and where Orochimaru never defected from the village. In the anime, while waiting to join Dan for a Kage Summit, she reads a novel written by Jiraiya titled Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero , despite her telling him she had no interest in it earlier. In the novel, Konoha went through much less upheaval; the Fourth Hokage and his wife survived the Nine-Tails' Attack on Konoha, and the Uchiha Clan Downfall never happened. Naruto and Sasuke eventually release the Infinite Tsukuyomi, freeing Tsunade and the rest of the world and thus ending the Fourth Shinobi World War. Blank Period Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky \nMain article: Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky Kakashi is appointed the Sixth Hokage after the Fourth Shinobi World War ends. Yet a year after the war is over, he still has yet to officially accept the duties of the office. Tsunade continues to carry out all the responsibilities until he's ready, but also pressures Kakashi to make a decision. Kakashi requests that she wait until he completes his mission to guard the Tobishachimaru on its top secret maiden voyage. The Tobishachimaru ends up being hijacked by the Ryūha Armament Alliance during its voyage, and the hijackers threaten to kill the passengers if Konoha doesn't release their leader, Garyō , from the Blood Prison in Kusagakure ; they also stipulate that Naruto not be involved. After being informed that Kakashi is aboard the Tobishachimaru, Tsunade summons Konoha's available personnel, with the exception of Naruto. \nWhile trying to plan what to do, Tsunade is contacted by the Third Tsuchikage , who informs her that the \"secret\" Tobishachimaru is visible from several countries, including his own Iwagakure . Although she assures him it is bound for Kusa, he warns her that he will need to destroy it if it threatens his village, which would complicate the relationship between Konoha and Iwa. Tsunade shares this threat with one of the hijackers, Rahyō , but it does not deter him. Having few options left, Tsunade decides that the ship must be destroyed before Iwa is forced to intervene. She has Ino Yamanaka tell Kakashi to do what he can but also warn him of her decision. She leads the assembled available Konoha ninja to the Blood Prison to be on hand in case the worst should happen. \nKakashi ultimately crashes the Tobishachimaru just outside the Blood Prison, thus averting an incident with Iwa. However, several passengers died during the hijacking and the entire incident has been an embarrassment to Konoha. Tsunade is outraged by these developments and orders Kahyō , the highest-ranking hijacker to survive, taken into custody. Kakashi intervenes, asking that he be allowed to pass sentence on Kahyō instead. Tsunade allows it on the condition that Kakashi make it his first act as Sixth Hokage, which he agrees to. \nAfter the war, Tsunade studies the material that the White Zetsus are made of, and from her research is able to create prosthetic arms for Naruto and Sasuke, though Sasuke declines his. The Last: Naruto the Movie \nMain article: The Last: Naruto the Movie Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tsunade oversees the evacuation of the Land of Fire 's citizens to a fallout shelter to escape the crashing Moon . Naruto ultimately prevents the disaster, the announcement of which Tsunade happily listens to. Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze \nMain article: Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze Tsunade meets Sakura for drinks, partly to congratulate her for her recent work with the Konoha Hospital , but also to try to convince Sakura to take it easy, as she's been working harder than she needs to. Sakura changes the subject to asking how to gain men's attention. When Tsunade can't offer her any specific advice, Sakura asks that Tsunade bet against her love life, hoping for Tsunade's bad luck to play in her favour. \nSakura later meets with Tsunade for drinks again, where she shares rumours that someone with Sasuke Uchiha 's appearance and chakra signature is conspiring against Konoha. The appearance is easily faked, but the chakra signature has Sakura stumped; she asks Tsunade if it would be possible to reproduce someone's chakra signature by gathering large amounts of skin and hair that naturally fall off. Tsunade deems the idea plausible. Sakura is reassured and Tsunade tells her she's happy to help, but she reminds Sakura that she's retired and that she should try to figure things out for herself.

Due to how he makes his announcement, the other villages come to believe that Konoha is aiding Hiruko's schemes and so start amassing against Konoha. While Tsunade tries to defuse the situation, Kakashi confides in her that he met Hiruko many years ago and was branded with a mind-controlling technique that will force him to go to Hiruko. Knowing that this will happen soon and that Hiruko will at some point try to take his Sharingan , Kakashi asks Tsunade to place a seal on him that will activate his Mangekyō Sharingan when Hiruko tries to do so, thus killing him and preventing war. Tsunade complies and, once Kakashi is gone, she declares him a missing-nin to keep his plans a secret. She forbids anyone from going after him, but Naruto ends up ignoring her.
