But it didn’t take long for it to not work, as he was fired 28 games into his tenure, with an 11-17 record that led to John Elway taking control of the franchise again. \n“Sure. All the experiences I’ve had in coaching I hope have made me a better person, better coach,” McDaniels said. “I think so much about this game, this business, is about people and trying to put together the right group of people and allow them to have their responsibilities, trust them to do their job and be a great resource for them and help them in any way that you can. \n“Some of the things I failed at before, I think I learned from and am better for it. I think I am.” \nHe interviewed with the Rams, Jaguars and 49ers this offseason, and as long as he’s calling plays for Tom Brady and the Patriots, there will be a demand for him. But he seemed to know that he needed the step back, as he thinks about a chance to repair his resume down the road.
