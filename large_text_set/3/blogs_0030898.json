He said the shark is “the talk of the town” and many locals have turned out to touch it. \nSome social media users are drawing a connection between the shark and Syfy’s Sharknado film series , which features sharks getting swept up in cyclones and wreaking havoc on cities. \nCyclone Debbie knocked out power to thousands when it slammed ashore with winds up to 260km/h (160mph) Tuesday.
