For example, demolition evictions,” Fox said. “They tell people the building is being demolished, the people leave, then they don't demo the building. There are dozens of tricks including intimidation, unnecessary construction to disrupt the environment at all hours, or raising the rent in violation of rent stabilization rules.” \nFox believes that many landlords factor evictions into their business models when they buy rent stabilized properties. \nNearly 70 current and former tenants across 22 A&E buildings filed a lawsuit — which is seeking class action status — in October claiming the company illegally raised rents of stabilized units and falsified paperwork with the state. \n“All one would have to do to determine if A&E is a good landlord is to go to their buildings and talk with their tenants,” said Aaron Carr of the advocacy group Housing Rights Initiative that's uncovered some of the alleged misconduct and is helping tenants with the lawsuit. \"We had people literally cry and beg us to help.\" \nThe rent of one plaintiff, who lives in a rent stabilized apartment at 344 Fort Washington Ave. in Washington Heights, for instance, was 230 percent higher than a previous tenant’s rent. That increase would have required more than $89,000 worth of improvements to the apartment, the suit say, but no such improvements were made. \n“We must ensure that our tax dollars are only going to landlords who treat our laws and our tenants with dignity and respect,” Carr said. \nA&E also has faced investigations by the state Attorney General’s office for illegal buyouts at an Upper West Side building ( which was settled for $540,000 ), and by the state’s Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) for rent hikes at a Washington Heights building (which is ongoing). \nA spokesman for A&E said the firm believed the lawsuit filed in October was without merit and has asked the court to dismiss it. \n“The allegations of 63 of its 68 plaintiffs concern the conduct of past owners, not our company,” the spokesman said. “Moreover, none of these alleged issues were brought to our attention or that of DHCR prior to this action.” \nNew landlords are on the hook for previous problems involving rent stabilized housing. \nWhen it comes to eviction cases, which are brought for nonpayment of rent, only 2 percent of the cases actually result in evictions, according to A&E data, while 98 percent of the cases get resolved with a schedule of a payment plan. \nCity officials said they reviewed A&E’s record extensively before entering into its affordability agreement at Riverton. \n“Instead of sitting on the sidelines while Riverton was again sold to the highest bidder without protections for tenants, we worked with local officials to intervene,” said mayoral spokeswoman Melissa Grace. “That resulted in greater rights for tenants, repairs to buildings, and a 35-year guarantee for a thousand affordable homes. Riverton’s families now have security because of what Mr. Patchett and the team accomplished.” \nNo one from Riverton was part of the lawsuit, nor have there been complaints from tenants from that complex. \nThe city’s department of Housing Preservation and Development has oversight over the complex to ensure that affordability is maintained. \nCynthia Allen, the tenant leader of Riverton, said “so far so good” about the relationship with A&E, which is building a center for the seniors in the community slated to open this spring. \n“They ask for our input and do consult with us,” Allen said. “Just because there’s nice things they seem to be doing, it doesn’t mean that we’re going to overlook if there’s something that’s out of line. We’re both clear on where the line is.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:46:10.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
