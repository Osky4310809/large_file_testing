Now, however, new details about the project could rile up his friends on the right. \nAccording to a report from CNN , the pipeline may be exempt from Trump’s oft repeated demand that U.S. infrastructure and pipeline projects use U.S. steel. \n“The way that the Executive Order is written is actually … specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired,” said an administration spokesperson, CNN reported. “Since [Keystone] is already currently under construction … it was hard to go back. Everything moving forward would be all under that executive order.” \nWhile the president has said that construction of the Keystone and equally controversial Dakota Access pipelines would create 28,000 domestic construction jobs, the steel for Keystone is expected to come from sources around the word. \nPresident Obama had previously stalled both projects as the pipeline routes would have traversed traditional Native American lands. \nThe pipeline clarification starkly contradicts promises Trump made during his recent address to CPAC and elsewhere. \n“I said, ‘Who makes the pipes for the pipeline?’ Well, sir, it comes from all over the world, isn’t that wonderful? I said, ‘Nope, it comes from the United States or we’re not building one.” \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
