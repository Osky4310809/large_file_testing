USA Today spoke to two top people at Intel Drones â which provided the drones in the sky behind Gaga that displayed the US flag and the Pepsi logo â who confirmed that her stunt was done in advance. \nThe Intel sources explained that the openingÂ jump was filmed ahead of time due to \" weather and environment\" issues. Basically, if there had been rain during the Super Bowl, the roof of the stadium where Gaga was standing would have been closed. While the drones still could have operated, Gaga obviously couldn't have flown down from a closed stadium. \nBut Gaga did indeed drop from the top of NRG Stadium in the pre-recorded bit, and did not use a stunt double, so we can still be impressed. \nClever editing made it appear both at home and on the jumbotrons at the stadium that Gaga's drop from the top of the stadium led directly into her flight on cables in the middle of the stadium. But in fact on Super Bowl night, Gaga started from a lower point, as you can see in this video from TMZ Â and another video from inside the stadium below. \nLady Gaga actually started her live flying at the Super Bowl from a lower point in the stadium, as seen here. Her drop from the top was pre-recorded.
