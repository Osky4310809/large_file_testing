However, the song was popularized by covers by George Jones as well as Chris Stapleton and Justin Timberlake at the 2015 CMA Awards. \nAfter his cover of “Tennessee Whiskey” went viral, the dad pulled his van over in a church parking lot to thank everyone for the support. \n“Thank you guys for all of the comments and prayers and likes and shares,” the man says. “I’m completely amazed, baffled, knocked off my feet that this thing has done what it’s done.”\nHe then murders his cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd‘s classic rock hit “Simple Man.”\nI’d imagine that he’ll be on “Ellen” next week where he will be given a well-deserved music contract. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T05:27:34.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
