We've got one of the best managers in the world, if not the best. I'm pretty sure he'd stay [if a Chinese Super League club came in for Pochettino], he's started a project here, we've got the stadium coming, so the future is very bright. \n\"Performances like West Brom and winning games like that, the next step for us is winning trophies, so hopefully we can do that this season and push us onto the world scale. \nVertonghen injury 'very bad' \n\"I'd be very surprised if any of our players went out there, especially within the next couple of seasons. What we've got going on here is something very great and I think it would be silly for the players here not to be part of it.\" \nTottenham held onto second place in the Premier League table after Liverpool could only manage a draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.
