After watching the trailer of the film, all we can say is this one is gonna be one hell of an entertainer. More than Shahid and Saif it’s Kangana whose performance we are looking forward to watch in the movie. This is the first time when Vishal Bhardwaj has cast Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan together in a film and from what it looks like, this one’s gonna be a masterpiece. After releasing the power-packed trailer, it seems like the makers have decided to treat us with some more of the bold actress’ hot-looking avatar in the film. The first song from Rangoon is gonna be out on either January 10 or January 11 on Tuesday or Wednesday in the coming week. \nWe at BollywoodLife are the first ones to EXCLUSIVELY reveal it to you that the first song from Rangoon titled Bloody Hell will be releasing in the coming week. The song plays in the first few seconds of the trailer. Our sources reveal that Bloody Hell is more of an item number. So this clearly means that Kangana will be the major highlight of the song. So you guys will get to see Shahid and Saif for sure in the song but it’s gonna be a song riding entirely on the shoulders of Kangana. Obviously it won’t be one of those item songs that we have nowadays considering the film is based on World War II. Not just that the crew is trying to launch the song on a very large scale and for that they are planning something really BIG. So Bloody Hell from Rangoon is something that we are desperately looking forward to. \nDirected by Vishal Bhardwaj, Rangoon is a period drama that’s highly awaited. Why? Primarily, because Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan are coming together to share the screen space for the first time. While most of us thought that there will always be awkwardness between the two given their history, on the contrary, the two decided to agree on doing a film together. This proves that there is absolutely no animosity between them. And with Kangana Ranaut as the lead actress, the film is obviously gonna be something worth watching. \n ; \nThe basic storyline of Rangoon is that it’s a period drama based on World War II. There is a love triangle of sorts between Sasha, Kangy and Saif. The film also has in store for you a lot of drama and suspense. “Rangoon is a highly emotional film. It’s got a lot of killing and emotions involved. It is also quite an entertainer. It’s got a big twist and the film is based on a lot of suspense.. war suspense,” ads a source.
