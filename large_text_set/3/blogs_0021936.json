But while they seem to be popular with visitors who share photos on social media , the government department Global Affairs Canada is less than impressed. \n\"We are aware of instances where our missions in the United States had decided to purchase and use these cut-outs,\" spokesman Michael O'Shaughnessy tells CBC. \"The missions have been asked to no longer use these for their events.\" CBC says the department did not respond to questions about why the instruction was given. \nThe decision comes after a freedom of information request by the opposition Conservative Party revealed emails sent between embassy and consular staff. They show that the embassy in Washington DC paid for express delivery of a Trudeau cut-out last summer so that it would arrive in time for Canada Day celebrations, The Canadian Press reports . \nThe Washington embassy's interest was apparently piqued by the presence of a cardboard Trudeau at the consulate in Atlanta. Some staff were concerned that the idea was not very prime ministerial, but the embassy's events production manager said it would be \"a hoot\" and prove popular on Snapchat. Photos from the day show visitors to the embassy posing for pictures alongside the cut-out. \nWhile some saw it as a bit of fun, the Conservatives didn't miss the opportunity to take a dig at the real prime minister, MP John Brassard telling CBC: \"A life-size, two-dimensional cut-out is probably a perfect metaphor for everything that Justin Trudeau represents.\" \nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter .
