Restoring trust and bringing about effective policing will be difficult unless CPD eliminates unnecessary, harmful differences in how people in these communities are treated,” the report found. \n“Our investigation also found that CPD has tolerated racially discriminatory conduct that not only undermines police legitimacy, but also contributes to the pattern or practice of unreasonable force,” the report continued. \nWhat I found frustrating, however, was how the DOJ report tiptoed around the role racism has played in creating an abusive culture within the Chicago Police Department. \nThe Police Accountability Task Force Report that was released last April got right to it in its executive summary. \nOn Friday, Lori Lightfoot, Police Board President and co-chair of the mayor’s Police Accountability Task Force, was asked about the Justice Department’s apparent reluctance to put race front and center. \n“You can’t talk about reforms of a large urban police department without coming to terms with race. We set that out in bold relief in our task force report back in April,” Lightfoot said. \n“We have a long history in this city of difficult, fractured relationships between the police department and communities of color,” she said. \nIt isn’t until page 139 of the 161 page DOJ report, that the feds got down to the heart of the matter: \n“Any effort to restore trust and ensure lawful policing in Chicago must focus on Chicago’s predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods, especially those with high rates of violent crime,” the report said. \nBefore then, the report cited numerous incidents, in which police officers acted recklessly, including shooting at fleeing unarmed suspects. \nBut the investigators did not reveal the race of either the suspect or the officers involved in the encounters. \nThat could give the impression that unlawful and reckless policing is happening all over the city when it isn’t. \nBlack and Hispanic citizens catch the brunt of the racist and brutal cop behavior because there are still too many racist cops on the street. \nThe problem won’t get fixed unless it is acknowledged that racial hatred is at the heart of our troubles. \nUnfortunately, police brass has been unwilling to address negative racial attitudes within the department. \nThe DOJ report found a “recurrence of unaddressed racially discriminatory conduct by officers. Investigators used the example of a photo from the early 2000s that later surfaced in a Sun-Times story that showed white CPD officers Jerome Finnegan and Timothy McDermott “squatting over a black man posed as a dead deer with antlers as the officers hold their rifles.” \n“White officers routinely called black youth “n*", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T07:16:19.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
