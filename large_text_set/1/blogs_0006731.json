AFP/Getty Images \nLondon’s Tube network began to grind to a halt on Sunday evening at the start of a 24-hour strike set to cripple the city’s transport network. \nUp to 4,000 station and ticket office workers walked out in a bitter dispute over job losses and ticket closures after last-ditch weekend peace talks between transport bosses and unions collapsed. \nThe strike began at 6pm on Sunday as some Zone 1 Tube stations prepared to close and major disruption across the rest of the network began. \nMany Londoners dashed to catch the last services before 6pm while others told how they were preparing their bikes for the morning commute on Monday. Zone 1: A sign at Leicester Square station. (AFP/Getty Images) \nTube services will begin later on Monday, from 7am, and stations that do open are expected to close earlier at 7pm. \nTransport for London have not yet released details of which stations will be closed, but said nearly all Zone 1 stations will be shut during the walkout. \nThere will be no Tube interchange from stations including Paddington, Victoria, King's Cross, Waterloo, Euston, Bank and London Bridge – although National Rail services are unaffected. All day Monday: The strike is set to last until the end of Monday. (AFP/Getty Images) \nPiccadilly line services will run between Hammersmith and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3, but there will be no service to Terminals 4 or 5. \nThere will be no service at all on the Victoria or Waterloo & City lines, and all other lines will be severely affected with limited services in outer London. What time does the Tube strike start and when will it finish? \nTfL said they are putting on around 150 extra buses to move people about the city on Monday, while river services will also be enhanced. \nThere will be posters, digital boards and announcements in stations to keep people informed of the latest level of service and people are advised to check before they travel at \nThe dispute, led by RMT union and the TSSA, is over job cuts and ticket office closures by former London mayor Boris Johnson. \nTfL say there is “no need for a strike” and they have already started to recruit more staff. \nBike specialist Halfords said they are offering free bike checks at its shops across the capital to help anyone switching to two wheels because of the Tube strike. \nThe retail giant said its staff will check brakes, gears, wheels, tyres and chains and offer expert advice on bike maintenance and cycling.
