The phone, made by Siemens out of a Bakelite (a type of plastic) body, was designed to be mobile– the handset needed to be rotated to be removed, to keep it securely on the phone during train travel, for example.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:23:25.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
