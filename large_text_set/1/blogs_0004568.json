ESPN’s Chris Haynes has a good story examining the Blazers’ summer , and why they failed to sign any free agent of note, re-signed all their own players, gave way too much money to Evan Turner, and took a flyer on a cheap contract for the oft-injured former Warriors center Festus Ezeli.

Then two games later, after a crushing defeat in Memphis, Ezeli once again started giving a team speech, but he was cut short. \nMcCollum interrupted Ezeli in midsentence and told him that was enough, sources told ESPN. Portland was in the midst of an emotionally draining December, losing 11 of 13 games. Players were desperately pouring out every ounce of effort trying to change the trajectory of the season, and being lectured by someone who wasn’t even playing wasn’t received favorably. \nYeah, I’d be pretty annoyed if Kyle Wagner lectured me about needing to blog more. Welcome to Portland, Festus, now enjoy shutting up while the Blazers try to figure out why they suck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:22:39.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
