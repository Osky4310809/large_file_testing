Detectives were conducting interviews, Guglielmi added.\nWorking around the clock to locate Deahvion Austin who was sexually assaulted on Facebook. Anyone w/ info call 911. https://t.co/fto2MlVpnX \n— Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) March 21, 2017 \n\nDeahvion had last been seen in person on Sunday afternoon, but her mother feared she might be in danger after seeing her daughter in a disturbing Facebook Live video.\n“It’s disgusting. It’s so disgusting.”\nThat’s how Stacey Elkins described the video that she said shows her daughter in various stages of undress with several young men.\nShe said her daughter appears to be scared, and the men are acting abusive toward the teen.\nGuglielmi had said investigators are treating the case as a sexual assault.\nElkins shared her concerns with Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson during a chance encounter outside the Ogden District police station on Monday as she was going in to file a missing person’s report.\nJohnson escorted her inside to make sure it was handled immediately.\n“I’m a father with two daughters, and I could see the pain in her face, and I want her to know that CPD is here to help you,” he told CBS 2’s Mai Martinez.\nJohnson said he’s also very disturbed that at one point at least 36 people were watching the video live, but no one alerted police.\n“There were so many people that saw it and didn’t pick up the phone and dial 9-1-1. That’s just not right,” he said.\nFacebook has taken the video down.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:14:10.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
