Yet, even those few are now turning on him after the White House decided to overturn Obama's bathroom mandate, which allows transgender people to use whichever bathroom they choose. \nJackie Evancho, the 16-year-old opera singer who sang at Trump's inauguration and whose sister happens to identify as transgender, expressed concern over the policy change and told the president she'd like to meet with him for a sit down. The president welcomed the discussion, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday. \nCaitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce Jenner), also wants to give the president an earful. In a new Twitter post, the transgender activist, who is a Republican, called Trump's bathroom ordinance reversal a \"disaster.\" Well @realDonaldTrump , from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq â€” Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017 \nBefore Trump overturned the bathroom mandate, he expressed more of an indifferent tone on the issue, even noting in an interview last year that Jenner could use whichever bathroom she chose at Trump Tower. \nThe Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing on the bathroom mandate for March 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:48:16.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
