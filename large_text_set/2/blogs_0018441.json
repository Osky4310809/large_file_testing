Pop singer Selena Gomez has listed the Fort Worth mansion she bought last year to spend more time with her Texas friends and family.\n“The media room won me over the minute I walked in,” Gomez said in a release from Briggs Freeman Sotheby’s International Realty, which has the $2.999-million listing. The agents are John Zimmerman and Todd Terry.\nGomez loves watching movies with family in the luxurious home theater, and she was drawn to the home’s two master suites.\nPhotos by Charles Lauersdorf \nThe resort-style estate sits on more than 1.5 acres, with 5 bedrooms, 7 baths and parking for up to 8 cars. Its more than 10,000 square feet are built for entertaining: In addition to the media room and a large game room, there’s also a spacious great room with a fireplace and vaulted ceilings that adjoins a chef’s eat-in kitchen with a giant center island and high-end appliances. A second kitchen is ideal for guests or catered parties.\nFor outdoor fun, enjoy the saltwater pool with a rock slide, the outdoor kitchen and living room, a putting green and a tennis/sport court.\nRelated: \nYou Could Own the Fannings’ Childhood Home for $2.85M Sleepless in SoHo?
