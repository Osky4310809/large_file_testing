It's been a total disaster. And Mark [Burnett] will never, ever bet against Trump again, and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings,\" said the president, drawing laughs from the crowd. \nBurnett, the show's producer, was at the breakfast and introduced Trump. \nSchwarzenegger then fired back on Twitter, questioning why Trump brought up the reality show's ratings at the faith-themed forum.

Why don’t we switch jobs: You take over TV, because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job. Then people can finally sleep comfortably again,\" he said. \nAfter riffing about the NBC reality show, Trump then moved into his remarks on religion, declaring that he hopes to be at the event \"seven more times.\" \nTrump said that five simple words have stuck with him throughout his travels across the country. \n\"'I am praying for you.' I hear it so often,\" he said, adding that \"your faith and prayers have sustained me and inspired me through some very, very tough times.\" \nTrump also remembered fallen Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed in a raid on a suspected terrorist hideout in Yemen over the weekend. \n\"Terrorism is a fundamental threat to religious freedom. It must be stopped and it will be stopped,\" he said. \nUPDATE : White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the \"Apprentice\" comments at a briefing later in the day. \nSpicer said the president made the remarks to be \"lighthearted\" toward his friend, Mark Burnett, and that the remarks on the whole were \"beautiful.\" \nWatch more from the remarks below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:29:50.681+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
