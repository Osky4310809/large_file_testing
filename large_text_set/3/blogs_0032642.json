General Mike Flynn ‘s offer to testify before Congress in the Russia investigation in exchange for immunity , \nIn a Twitter dispatch that hit the Internet shortly after 7:00 a.m. ET, Trump blasted the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.” He also dismissed the proceedings as nothing more than an “excuse for big election loss.” Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017 \nOn Thursday night, Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner , issued a statement that his client was ready to talk in exchange for immunity. \n“General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Kelner said. Statement from Flynn’s atty seems to acknowledge seeking immunity, explaining it’s necessary in “highly politicized, witch hunt environment” pic.twitter.com/IH7ZVLwLnw \n— Kenneth P.
