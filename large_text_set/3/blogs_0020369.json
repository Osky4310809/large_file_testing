They evacuated to safer areas after communist rebels occupied their villages. JOHN UNSON NORTH COTABATO, Philippines — Communist rebels occupied an upland barangay in Antipas town in North Cotabato early Thursday and forced hundreds of villagers to leave at gunpoint, authorities claim. Provincial and municipal education officials immediately decided to shut down all schools in Barangay Camutan in Antipas and evacuated school children to safer areas. Antipas Mayor Egidio Cadungon, chairman of the municipal peace and order council, confirmed the occupation of Barangay Camutan by hundreds of New People’s Army guerrillas who arrived there at past 6:00 a.m. Thursday. Barangay officials said the NPAs immediately looted houses, collected money from villagers and took their farm animals. Army and police intelligence units are now validating reports that the NPAs are holding 70 residents captive, to be used as “human shields” if the military will drive them away. Barangay Camutan is a hinterland barangay close to mountain ranges where there is heavy NPA presence. The first to evacuate immediately after the NPAs arrived in Barangay Camutan were 47 families driven away at gunpoint after having been robbed of their money, wristwatches, farm tools, clothes and livestock in their yards. The rebels also ransacked and took goods for sale in sari-sari stores abandoned by owners. Cadungon said the attack also caused panic in neighboring barangays. Barangay officials have sent emissaries to the rebels to convince their commanders to set their hostages free.
