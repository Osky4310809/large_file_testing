The Blue Jays' Darrell Ceciliani, centre, gets high-fives from teammates after hitting a grand slam against the Phillies on Friday in Florida. ( John Raoux / The Associated Press   FLA.—The big play in the Blue Jays’ 7-5 win over the Phillies came from outfielder Darrell Ceciliani, whose grand slam formed the core of a five-run fifth inning. The 26-year-old finished Friday with two hits and five RBI. “He’s having a great spring,” said manager John Gibbons . “I’ve always been a fan of his, as have everybody in the organization. He’s a good, hard-nosed baseball player. He’s having a tremendous spring again (and) just waiting for that opportunity to open up.” WHO IS THAT? Designated hitter Kendrys Morales made a rare appearance in the field, playing first base against the Phillies. He finished one hit in four at-bats, and scored once. ON THE MEND: Devon Travis and Josh Donaldson returned to the Jays’ minor league complex, where they’ve been appearing in limited roles since Tuesday.   While Donaldson still isn’t permitted to run bases, Travis was scheduled to ease back into it, running out his hits then deferring to a pinch runner. Travis, who’s recovering from a bone bruise to his right knee, says the biggest challenge is fighting the urge to sprint too fast, too soon. “I’m the type of player who plays balls-to-the-wall all the time, and I’ve got to start listening to my body,” Travis said after batting practice Friday morning. “It’s still playing hard. It’s just being smart at the same time. PEARCE WILL BE IN: Outfielder Steve Pearce sat out Wednesday’s game as he continues to rehab from off-season elbow surgery, but Gibbons expects him to line up at first base on Sunday when the Jays play the Pirates in Bradenton. Like Russell Martin and Donaldson, Pearce took at-bats in Friday’s minor league game in Dunedin. “He’s chomping at the bit. He’s ready to go,” Gibbons said. “We put him on a good program and we’ll see how it goes from there. I don’t see any setbacks.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:22:13.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
