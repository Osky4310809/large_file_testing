Facebook \nThe caption reads: \nWearing grandma’s wedding dress lmaoooo. I’m getting married but it’s to pizza. Sorry bois I’m a taken woman. \nHigh school photographer Marcy Harris saw the Facebook post on her news feed and, as she explains in her blog, \nOf course, the weirdo I am, was like ‘This is awesome… We should totally get photos of you in this dress marrying a pizza…’ \nWagner’s mom gave the teen permission to do the shoot, and after that, it was GAME TIME, Metro.co.uk reports . \nHarris describes the preparation process, saying, \nOver the next couple days, Christine and I planned her dream wedding. She had so many amazing ideas. Like the pizza should wear a bow tie… and the ring would obviously have to be a ring pop. We debated about having bacon roses, but because her mom was a bit worried about the dress getting dirty, we decided to stick with just a couple basic props. \nThe day of the shoot, they commissioned a pepperoni pizza from Wagner’s favorite pizza place, Cristy’s Pizza in Baltimore, to be the groom. Just take a look at the happy couple on their big day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:45:24.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
