Photograph: Stringer/Reuters More than 250 skulls found in 'enormous mass grave' in Mexico Secret burial pits in Veracruz contain drug cartel victims, state prosecutor said Advocacy groups push for excavation to find people missing for years   Associated Press in Mexico City   17.10   17.15 GMT \nMore than 250 skulls have been found in what appears to be a clandestine burial ground on the outskirts of the Mexican city of Veracruz. \nState prosecutor Jorge Winckler said the clandestine burial pits appear to contain the victims of drug cartels killed years ago. 'Impunity has consequences': the women lost to Mexico's drug war Read more \n“For many years, the drug cartels disappeared people and the authorities were complacent,” Winckler said, in apparent reference to the administration of fugitive former state governor Javier Duarte and his predecessors. \nIn an interview with the Televisa network, Winckler did not specify when the skulls were found or by whom. \nBut victims’ advocacy groups have excavated and pressed authorities to excavate such sites for years to find missing loved ones. \nWinckler said excavations have covered only a third of the lot where the skulls were found, and more people may be buried there. \n“I cannot imagine how many more people are illegally buried there,” Winckler said. \n“Veracruz is an enormous mass grave,” he said. “It is the biggest mass grave in Mexico and perhaps one of the biggest in the world.” \nThe state had long been dominated by the ferocious Zetas cartel . But the Jalisco New Generation cartel began moving in around 2011, sparking bloody turf battles. \nVictims’ advocacy groups have criticized authorities for doing little to try to find or identify the state’s missing people, many of whom were kidnapped and never heard from again.
