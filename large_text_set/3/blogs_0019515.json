An Android version was announced back in January , though a release date wasn’t specified. Today, Nintendo has revealed that Android users will get to play Mario’s first (official) mobile game on March 23.\nSuper Mario Run became a huge hit when it was released on December 15. Nintendo reported that the game had been downloaded over 50 million times just a week after it had launched. As of January, Super Mario Run has been downloaded 78 million times and has generated approximately $53 million in revenue for Nintendo.\nAndroid version of #SuperMarioRun will be available on 3/23 with the Ver.2.0.0 update!

Beyond knowing that the game arrives with the 2.0.0 update, we don’t yet know if this version will be any different than the one folks on iOS devices are currently enjoying.\nJust like the iOS version, Super Mario Run on Android allows users to sample three levels for free. If they want more, users will have to fork over $10 to unlock the full game. This pricing caused controversy on iOS so it will be interesting to see if the same will happen on Android. Unlike last time, however, users will know exactly what they are getting into with this game. At least, those who keep up with gaming news will.\nDespite some grievances regarding its pricing, Super Mario Run was a hit on iOS and it will no doubt be successful on Android. It is unclear whether or not the game will generate the same sort of revenue on Android as it did on iOS. But even if only 5% of the user base pays for the full game (as was the case for the iOS edition), it will still bring in a healthy amount of revenue for Nintendo.\nIf you’re looking forward to playing Super Mario Run on Android, then make sure to read this handy guide from us in order to be prepared.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:19:11.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
