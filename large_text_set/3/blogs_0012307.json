Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nRobbie Savage drew on his personal experience of being banned retrospectively, where intent was a key factor, in his analysis of the 'stamping' incident involving Tyrone Mings and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nIn his Mirror Sport column, Savage insisted Bournemouth defender Mings – who was banned for five games by the FA – was the only person alive who knows whether he meant to trample on the Manchester United striker's head. \nIbrahimovic was suspended for three matches after elbowing Mings by way of apparent retaliation, and after trawling through his weekly correspondence online, our pundit exercises his right of reply in Sav Says: If Tyrone Mings didn't mean to trample on Zlatan Ibrahimovic - why wouldn't he check he was OK? The controversial incident in which Mings 'stamps' on Ibrahimovic's head (Photo: Sky Sports) \nJames Norris @nozzla: First time I've liked one of your articles. If it was an accident he would have apologised. Simple. \nSAV SAYS: “Another convert? Welcome aboard! I understand your point about apologising, because if you tread on somebody else's head it's human nature to say sorry. But the heart of the matter with Mings and Ibrahimovic is that ONLY the Bournemouth defender knows whether his action was deliberate or not. He is the only person on the planet who actually knows the truth. In the case I discussed from my back catalogue, where I caught Chelsea's Mateja Kezman in the face accidentally and got banned retrospectively for it, I did apologise to him and tell him I didn't mean it – but only when played had stopped. I don't think you can expect Mings to stop running and apologise to Zlatan while the ball is in play and the game is still going on. If he did apologise, I don't think Ibrahimovic was very impressed – because a few moments later, he got an elbow in the chops.

It's a good job Zlatan's head wasn't on the ground and had nowhere to go. Could have been very bad. \nSAV SAYS: “Yes, it could have been very serious – but that's all hypothetical, it's all ifs and buts. If Zlatan's head had been planted on the ground and a 6ft 5in defender had trodden on it, the consequences could have been dreadful. And if Zlatan's elbow had caught Mings flush on the temple shortly afterwards, that could have done serious damage – but fortunately, as shocking as both incidents were, neither had a harrowing outcome.

That's the bottom line. That's what I've been saying all along.” \nMike Vine @10mjv: Feels like 'big club' versus 'small club' syndrome. Hard enough for Bournemouth to survive in Prem without continued poor refereeing \nSAV SAYS: “Steady on, Mike. The nature of the two flashpoints involving Ibrahimovic and Mings was serious enough without adding a layer of conspiracy to all the arguments. We're going down a dangerous road if we start accusing referees of favouritism or double standards when the real issue here is players showing due care for each other's wellbeing on the pitch. Big clubs and big players should not come into it when one player's head has been trampled and another's has been elbowed. I don't like to see either of those things on a football pitch, or anywhere else for that matter, and the incidents should be judged based on what happened, not the badges or the names on the shirt. For the record, Ibrahimovic was given a three-match ban because he accepted the FA's violent conduct charge – Mings was given a longer ban because he contested his case and the FA did not accept his explanation.” Read More If Mings apologise to Ibrahimovic, it didn't go down well (Photo: Getty Images) \nMkhitaRYAN @Stay_Vicious20: Good read. Think you summed it up well with the “trampling without due care” \nSAV SAYS: “To tell the truth, I 'borrowed' that phrase from my Daily Mirror colleague Mike Walters on his Twitter timeline. I think it covers the incident perfectly.” \nPaul Langan @PaulLangan5: Sad when the only memorable moment of your career is when you hurt another player \nSAV SAYS: “Tell me, Paul – did I only imagine Wales 2 Italy 1, in front of 75,000 people at the Millennium stadium? That was truly memorable for those of us who played in it.” Savage and Christian Panucci clash on the memorable night in Cardiff when Wales beat Italy 2-1 (Photo: Getty Images) \nFi3ld @Fi3ld23: If you or @JoeyBarton7 did it there would be no doubt. As there shouldn't be with him. Intent was there \nSAV SAYS: “Good point – reputation is an important factor here. Stamping or elbowing people is not nice, but if you have a past history of being in trouble with the FA, the likelihood is that you would be hammered for it. I speculated in my column that my reputation, or someone like Joey Barton's, would have gone before us and we would probably have been guilty until proven innocent, not the other way round, if we had been accused of doing the same thing as Tyrone Mings. Can you imagine the outcry if Roy Keane or Luis Suarez had been charged with something similar. They would not just have had the book thrown at them – it would have been the whole encyclopaedia. But that's the nature of football these days... reputations do seem to count, even though I never stamped on anyone.” Only Mings knows the truth about what happened with Ibrahimovic (Photo: PA) \nAND FINALLY... \nAnder Herrera's red card in the Chelsea-Manchester United FA Cup quarter-final polarised opinions, roughly along a north-south and red-blue axis. But one Twitter critic saw another side to referee Michael Oliver's decision. \nCrash Blandycoot @blandy_son: @RobbieSavage8 Worst decision since your haircut \nSAV SAYS: “You might be right, to be fair. It's attracted a lot of critical opinion.
