New information has revealed that the man may have been able to get into the White House grounds because of a change in the area's security.\nThe man was allegedly able to enter the grounds after Secret Service removed alarm sensors from the part of the fence that he scaled, sources told the Washington Examiner. Tran reportedly entered the area shortly before midnight on March 10.\nTran reportedly did set off an alarm when he initially scaled the fence, but birds and squirrels can trigger the sensors as well, which reportedly could have caused uncertainty.\nThe Secret Service reportedly removed sensors when the fence around the White House was altered to make it higher and more difficult to scale, allegedly putting the sensors to use elsewhere. The sensors that were removed were reportedly not replaced.\nAgents have also questioned why the agency's K-9 unit was not dispatched after the first alarm was set off, and only called in later to inspect the intruder's bag for explosives.\nTran was reportedly carrying two cans of pepper spray, a letter to President Donald Trump, as well as Trump's book, according to the NY Times. The Secret Service noted that while Tran was able to wander around the grounds, he did not enter the White House itself.\nTran reportedly bypassed several layers of security, and was able to wander on the White house grounds for 17 minutes.\nThe incident led Republican Representative to state that \"big changes\" were needed in the Secret Service.\nOne week later, on March 18, another man snuck onto the White House grounds claiming that he \"had a bomb in his trunk.\" That man, identified as Sean Patrick Keoghan, 29, was charged with making false bomb threats and unauthorized use of a vehicle, after the car he had been driving was discovered to have been reported stolen.\nKeoghan reportedly stopped his car at the White House checkpoint shortly after 11 PM, and got out, telling officials that he had a bomb in the trunk. \"This is a test,\" Keoghan reportedly said as he was being detained.\nEarlier the same day, another man was arrested after jumping over barricades to enter a restricted area outside of the White House fence, where he reportedly stood \"yelling nonsensical statements.\" That man was identified as 58-year-old William Bryant Rawlinson.\nThe Secret Service has said that it is increasing its \"posture of readiness\" in response to the recent incidents.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:08:18.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
