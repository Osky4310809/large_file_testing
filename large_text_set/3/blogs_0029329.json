The exchange originally read: \nBrienne: Do you have any last words? \n[Stannis considers.] \nStannis: Do you believe in the life to come? \n[Brienne nods] \nStannis: I don’t. But if I’m wrong, and you’re right… tell Renly I’m sorry when you get there. I don’t imagine I’ll see him wherever I’m going. (beat) And my daughter. Tell her… tell her… \n[‘Sorry’ doesn’t even begin to cover what he feels about Shireen. The thought of it brings tears to his eyes, and he’s not going to die weeping in front of a woman he doesn’t know. \nStannis stares up at her.] \nStannis: Go on, do your duty. \nShowrunnners David Benioff and D.B.
