Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi , Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati have raised the pitch for the polls from Varanasi. Hence, Varanasi South is a critical constituency. BJP would like to keep the 2014 Lok Sabha momentum in the region whereas SP and Congress are dearly want to make inroads. Jibes have been hurled against each other frequently during the campaigning with PM Modi and Rahul and Akhileshâ€™s roadshows grabbing the eyeballs.Betting on the inconvenience caused to the people due to demonetisation move, the incumbent CM has blamed PM Modi and the BJP government at the Centre for causing unrest not just in UP, but across the country. Congress has recently accused PM Modi of fanning communalism during his campaign speech. Though BJP has not announced its chief ministerial candidate yet, but the saffron party is confident about forming government with full majority. BJP has also blamed SP of acting as a roadblock to the development of the state for years. \nVaranasi South is constituency No. 389 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It is situated in Varanasi district and comes under the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. \nNumber of voters \nAs per the Election Commission data, this constituency has a total of 2,72,845 registered electorates out of which 1,51,589 are male and 1,21,256 are female registered voters. \nWatch this video \nWho was the winner last time \nThe BJP won this constituency during the 2012 Assembly elections.
