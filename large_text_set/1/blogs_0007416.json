In case you’ve been under a rock, we are of course talking about Streep’s Golden Globes speech and Trump’s tweets about it. \nAccording to a report from The Guardian , at a reception for the Netflix documentary The White Helmets , which shows the lives of rescue workers in Syria, Clooney defended Streep. “Aren’t you supposed to be running the country?” he asked of Trump. He continued, saying “I didn’t vote for him, I don’t support him, I don’t think he’s the right choice.” \n“At this moment in our lives we have to hope that he doesn’t destroy everything,” he said. He’s not too confident, however, and added, “I don’t see any signs of it.” \n[featured image via Denis Makarenko / Shutterstock.com] \nHave a tip we should know?
