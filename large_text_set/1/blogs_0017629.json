We talked about Leeds, the sleeping giant. He mentioned it was a great opportunity if someone had a concrete project with a vision to bring back the passion. Kenny Dalglish suggested Leeds would be a great investment (Photo: Reuters / Phil Noble) \n“He mentioned about how the city is passionate about the club, and this is what I’m finding out. Maybe he told me this because he knew that I couldn’t buy Liverpool! \n“A few weeks later, I was talking about different clubs and someone mentioned Leeds. That’s when I got in touch with Massimo.” \nEight months later and those talks have resulted in Radrizzani buying a 50 per cent stake in Leeds with a view to purchasing full control in the summer. \nRadrizzani, who with his business partners sold sports rights firm MP and Silva for £685million in May, has a five-year plan to buy back Elland Road, modernise it and return Leeds to the Premier League. \nHe will not throw cash at Leeds and their boss Garry Monk, and instead wants to grow the club by unlocking its huge potential.

It’s not easy as I’m not here to lose money every year for the rest of my life. That would be stupid.” poll loading Will Garry Monk take Leeds back to the Premier League? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:44:20.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
