This work was in turn famously appropriated by Richard Prince, which recently led many to believe a Supreme x Richard Prince collaboration was on the way. The denim jacket in question from Supreme’s SS17 collection , however, is a joint project with Krantz, featuring his photography emblazoned throughout.\nNow we find the famed Western photographer linking with Modernica for what is being referred to as “The Way of the West” capsule. The delivery ultimately merges Jim’s iconic imagery with the also iconic fiberglass shell chair that was first designed as an entry in The Museum of Modern Art’s 1948 International Design Competition. This particular chair was handcrafted in LA, as all in all the collection features eight distinctive designs, limited to 50 pieces each and priced from $695 USD to $745 USD.\nYou can shop the Jim Krantz x Modernica “The Way of the West” capsule now online .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:59:59.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
