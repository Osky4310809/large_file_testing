It says anyone who arrives in the U.S. with a valid visa or refugee application should be allowed to enter the country. (credit: CBS) \nThe judge’s ruling is the result of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of travelers from those nations which are predominantly Muslim. \nThe president’s travel ban spurred protests at airports across the country, including at Denver International Airport where protesters there were warned they could be arrested. (credit: CBS) \nBut the crowd at DIA said they weren’t there to protest or demonstrate. Instead, they used the arrival one unsuspecting passenger who was at the center of their movement. \n“Omar is coming which gives us the legal right to be in this airport no matter what,” a woman said. (credit: CBS) \nCitizens gathered to welcome their friend Omar after his flight to DIA. While they waited many took the opportunity to publicly voice their concerns over President Trump’s executive order on immigration. \n“It was a reminder that wars do not need to be waged; the constitution just needs to be brought to light once again,” another woman said. \n“The ban is un-American,” a man said. \nTrump defended his executive order. \n“It’s not a Muslim ban but we are totally prepared to work it out very nicely,” Trump said. (credit: CBS) \nObeid Kaifo says it hits close to home. \n“I have family in Syria. I have family that are refugees. If they had the chance of leaving, now they certainly don’t,” Kaifo said. “It’s very disheartening.” \nWhile many Muslim travelers didn’t make it to their destination, Omar came home to a very warm welcome. Omar (credit: CBS) \n“No one was arrested and everyone is going to walk away feeling more American than when they got here,” another woman said. \nA group of immigration attorneys who waited at the international arrival gate all day told CBS4’s Andrea Flores that to their knowledge nobody was detained.
