Arsenal don't spend enough money to win league, says Nasri \nOne man who has already left on loan is promising midfielder Dan Crowley who has joined struggling Dutch side Go Ahead Eagles for the rest of the season. \nThe 19-year-old impressed at Oxford United in the first half of the season and will now join the Eredivisie side as they fight to stay in the league. He will link up with Liverpool's Pedro Chirivella - another Premier League youngster to have joined the club on loan this window. \n\nPSG have reportedly put Jese Rodriguez and Grzegorz Krychowiak up for sale with Arsenal rumoured to be interested in the latter. \nThe Poland international only joined the French champions from Sevilla last summer but they are already willing to let the £29m signing go, according to The Sun . \nWith Francis Coquelin, Granit Xhaka, Mohamed Elneny, Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla already fighting for a midfield berth, the 26-year-old would have some serious competition to get into the first team.
