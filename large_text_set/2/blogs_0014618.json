So given that his uniform for the game was mostly red and black he decided to show his support. \nExum — or perhaps a friend, we don’t want to assume his artistic talent — decorated his shoes with a fighter jet and the phrase “Carn the Bombers”. — Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) February 18, 2017 \nWe’re imagining it’s the first time NBA All-Star Weekend has seen anyone say “carn” anything. \nFittingly, Exum is back in action this season after missing all of the previous one, although his absence was due to injury. \nBefore being drafted in 2014, Exum told Essendon’s club website that he was a lifelong fan. \n“I have always been an Essendon supporter and when my brother was born in 1993 they won a premiership so since I was born in 1995 I have always been an Essendon supporter,” Exum said. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.
