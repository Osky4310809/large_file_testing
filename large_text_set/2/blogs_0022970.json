There’s even over 10 pages of images on Google when you search “lazy Sunday”. Is it because Monday is the most hated day of the week? If we sit around doing nothing on Sunday, do we feel like we’ve made the day longer thus prolonging the inevitability that is ‘Monday’? Do we feel we deserve a day where we do nothing, all day, to make up for all of the things that we’ve done during the week prior? I’m not 100% sure why Sunday’s are so stereotypically lazy but I am sure that with my help you can make the most of your lazy Sunday and not just lay around like a sloth. (Well, actually, you can still lay around like a sloth; just with a bit of productivity in between all the laying and slothing.) 1. Prioritize/To-do list. \nMore often than not the only thing holding us back from being productive is not knowing where to start. I think that this can be especially true for lazy Sundays. If you know me you know l’m a fan of to-do lists for productivity and what better way to begin a productive-lazy Sunday than prioritizing your tasks? Whether it’s work, chores, cooking or cleaning prioritizing your tasks can help you reduce stress and accomplish your tasks in a timely manner. Write down your tasks and ross them off as you complete them. 2. Coffee, coffee, coffee. \nCaffeine/coffee is a controversial suggestion as half of experts say that coffee helps your productivity and the other half say that it hurts your productivity. For me, I notice a marked difference in productivity when I have coffee, feel free to skip this step if it’s something that you find hurts your productivity. If you are looking for something a little more delicious than your traditional boring cup-o-joe, check out my recipe for the best organic iced vanilla latte. Vanilla lattes have a direct line to the part of my brain that controls my productivity. 3. Power hour. \nIn college “power hour” was a drinking game that we played in an effort to get as drunk as possible, as quickly as possible. In adult world I like to use “power hour” as an hour that I set aside to accomplish as much as possible, as quickly as possible. I am sure you that your lazy Sunday will feel a lot better if your home is clean, your laundry is done, your bed is changed, and dinner is cooking in the oven. Now that you’ve prioritized your to-do list, utilize power hour to get a large portion of your chores done, quickly. You might actually be surprised at how much you can actually accomplish in just 60 minutes if you don’t stop, don’t get distracted, and just keep moving. Set an alarm on your phone or set a timer for one hour and clean, cook, write, read, do whatever you have to do that you’re avoiding in the name of “lazy Sunday”. 4. Take breaks. \nThe especially lazy, lazy Sunday people will love this step. After your power hour, take a break. The purpose of power hour was to get as much done so you can still enjoy your lazy Sunday, lazily. It’s also good to take a break as focusing can drain a lot of energy and you don’t want to hurt your productive day with mental fatigue. Meditating, going for a nice walk, listening to music, reading, or working out are all great things to do post-power hour. 5. Take a nap. \nExperts from Forbes, ABC, Inc and more are all starting to say that napping can actually help boost your productivity and I couldn’t agree more. I’m no expert, but I do know that I feel great after waking up from a nap. I’m not suggesting that you go to sleep for 2 to 3 hours in the middle of your lazy Sunday but I am however suggesting posting up on your hammock and snoozing for 20-30 minutes. (If you, like me, don’t have a hammock; improvise.) Naps are known to improve your mood and what way to be more productive than with a good attitude? 6. Organize for the week ahead. \nSunday sets the tone for the week ahead and what better way to have a productive week than to have a productive Sunday? Set aside 20 to 30 minutes to write down your goals and tasks for the week ahead. You’re literally 1,000% more likely to accomplish tasks that you have written down.
