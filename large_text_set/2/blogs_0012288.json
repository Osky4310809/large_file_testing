( NOK ) is bringing clunky back. Seventeen years after the Finnish telecom giant rolled out what's been called the greatest handset ever, the Nokia 3310, it is making a comeback, albeit, a more modernized one. \nAccording to leaks on telecom blogs, Nokia’s design partner, HDM Global is gearing up to launch a new version of the Nokia 3310 at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona, Spain, later this month. And while the new take on the 3310 won’t weigh as much as a brick or require its own carry bag, it will be very affordable. The phone, which is expect to cost around $62, will be smaller than the original and is aimed at competing with low-end Android handsets. Spartan Vs. Android \nWhile the phone will be as bare bones as it gets, compared to current offerings, it’s expected to resonate with some consumers who harken back to the days when you could drop your phone and not shatter its glass screen. Fans also like its reliability and the long battery life. The original Nokia 3310 sold more than 120 million units since late 2000 (it was officially retired in 2005) and is credited with launching the first \"feature phone,\" which has now reached cult status. Nokia is going after the European market with the phone. It’s not clear if or when Nokia fans in the U.S. can get their hands on this device. \nThe Nokia 3310 is one of several phones HDM Global is gearing to roll out under the Nokia name this year after inking a 10-year licensing deal with Nokia. (See also: Nokia Branded Handsets Are Confirmed .) \nThe new 3310 isn’t the only Nokia handset expected to be unveiled in Barcelona. In stark contrast to the retro 3310 is the much-anticipated Nokia P1. The P1 boasts an all-metal body that is curved at the corners and looks similar to many of the Android smartphones on the market today. The P1 is also expected to have a 5.3-inch display with Gorilla Glass 5 and also reportedly comes equipped with dust and water protection. Unlike other Nokia-branded phones launched under HMD, the P1 is expected to have Android Nougat pre-installed and will sport a 22.6-megapixel rear camera, which one UK paper said would be the most powerful camera on a smartphone to date.
