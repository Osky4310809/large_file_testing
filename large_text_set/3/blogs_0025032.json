Ouch! @MindyKaling , heard Dr. Lahiri dissed Newark last night … @VogueMagazine & I disagree ✌: https://t.co/2wP7ZqJKQd (I still ❤️U!) pic.twitter.com/FSwfkxenQJ \n— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) March 23, 2017 \nThe Democrat tweeted, \nOuch! […] heard Dr. Lahiri dissed Newark last night \nBooker said he disagreed with the diss, and backed it up with a link to a Vogue guide on visiting Newark . \nHe ended the tweet by saying he still <3s her. ( H.) \nKaling hastily responded, assuring him she does not feel the same as her character. Twitter \nKaling’s character on the show is a non-PC alter-ego of real-life Mindy, so this reasoning stands up. \nClearly having gained some confidence from Kaling’s tweet, Booker went ahead and boldly asked her to join him for dinner in Newark. Twitter \nKaling agreed to dinner, quipping she just needed the PATH schedule (to get her from New York to Newark). \nThen, the PATH Twitter jumped in with the best interruption of all time, giving her the full schedule. \n— Nate Richards (@NateJRichards) March 23, 2017 \nBooker was pleased with this, but wanted to one-up PATH for his successful dinner-date-to-be.

Steglik (@StephenSteglik) March 23, 2017 \nNaturally, people on the internet were very excited by the idea of a Kaling-Booker relationship, and took to Twitter to gush over the potential couple. Twitter \nTwitter King Booker was particularly piqued by one person who referred to Newark’s bustling restaurant scene. Twitter \nHowever, it might take some time for Booker to have that dinner. \nThe Senate is a little bit busy right now handling things like Neil Gorsuch’s possible confirmation to the Supreme Court and a potential controversial health care bill coming in from the House Republicans. \nIndeed, Booker’s flirty tweet to Kaling came between throwing shade at President Donald Trump for the health care plan and retweeting the story of a black man killed by a white supremacist . \nBut, you know, talking to Mindy is important, too. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:15:06.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
