That’s the deal and the reasoning behind the discussions over a new two-year contract. \nMake no mistake. Wenger has made his decision clear that he wants to stay and, even at 67 and after years of stubbornness, he believes he can rediscover his glory years. \nThere will be a major shake-up of the squad, big changes behind the scenes - they want a new Academy director and in the longer term a director of football - and an expectation of Wenger being able to take the club “to the next level.” Wenger believes he can bring back the glory days (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane) \nThat has become the buzz phrase around the place despite the prospect of losing star duo Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil this summer. \nIf they will not sign new deals, then they will be sold and subconsciously Wenger is already having to plan without them which has been telling in dropping Sanchez at Liverpool while Ozil’s drop in form has been a cause of growing frustration. \nBut the sudden change in strategy around Wenger’s future has been revealing, with a belief that some of the backroom staff could be told this week about the Frenchman committing himself to a new deal.

Tuchel has been linked with the Arsenal job (Photo: Alexandre Simoes) \nIt is also interesting that the timing of Wenger staying comes at the start of an international break. Do your worst, be angry, go into meltdown and it may have subsided a little by the time Arsenal next play - against Manchester City on Sunday week - and Wenger next faces the media. \nThat is another factor in the decision. Arsenal need to be sure that Wenger can rebuild and succeed despite the stale atmosphere of disaffection. \nPlanes flying banners overhead at the Hawthorns, protests before and during games at home and away. It has become very difficult. But again Wenger must try to succeed against this backdrop. \nMaybe the next week or so is another acid test. How bad will it get? The depth of feeling. Arsenal are moving towards Wenger, but it is not done, not signed and maybe there is a tiny bit of wriggle room.

Yes, he has his faults, but he has been a mentor for young players through generations. \nAnd if the players think the manager is going, they tend to ease off, performances drop and if they know Wenger is staying then the hope will be that they pull together during the run-in. \nIt is something which blighted even the great Sir Alex Ferguson who admitted his biggest mistake while in charge of Manchester United. Ferguson went back on his decision to retire (Photo: Harold Cunningham/AFP/Getty) \nTwelve years before his retirement in 2013, Fergie shocked the football world by claiming it was going to be his last ever season. \nFergie recalled: “I think a lot of them had put their tools away. They thought, “Oh, the manager’s leaving”, but when I changed my mind in the January, I started thinking about United again and how we could get back on top.” \nThat is what Arsenal will be hoping will be the outcome for Wenger and his players not just in the next few weeks but for however long he stays in charge. poll loading Will Arsene Wenger still be at Arsenal next season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:46:20.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
