He is going to have to do it himself. Sergio has enough experience. He knows, everybody knows. \n\"I know what he is trying to do, without the ball and with it. We are going to talk to him, like with all of his team-mates, to convince him in these two games.\" \nGuardiola is eager for European success, although City come up against a team sitting top of Ligue 1 and having scored 76 goals in 26 league games. \n\"It is one of the most beautiful competitions to play, maybe not the most important, but the most beautiful and we have to do our best,\" he said.
