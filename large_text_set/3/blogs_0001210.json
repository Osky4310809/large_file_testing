Because while the trip will stop at many of the world's greatest hits, the 2019 sailing is meant to satisfy even the most seasoned globetrotters. \nIt helps that travelers will stay overnight in 14 destinations, including an evening in Luxor, Egypt, a night in Lisbon , and even two nights in certain cities like Shanghai . \nTo put things in perspective, cruisers will stop at 90 ports, spread across 36 countries in five continents. By the time the cruise concludes, 46,925 nautical miles will have been covered. \nBut the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites on the itinerary is reason enough to book this trip: 96, specifically, including Canada’s Joggins Fossil Cliffs , Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy, and the recently excavated Templar city of Old Acre in Israel. \nThis isn’t the first time Oceania has launched a Jules Verne-style odyssey. In 2015, the cruise line’s first around the world sailing departed from Miami. \nNow, four years later, the latest iteration of their around the word cruise will offer travelers unprecedented flexibility, with the option to depart from New York City , Miami , or Los Angeles . And this year, travelers can choose from 72 complimentary shore excursions or a $7,200 onboard credit (up from the 62 excursions or $6,200 included in the 2018 sailing). \nReservations, which start at $35,699 per guest, opened on March 1, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T02:24:09.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
