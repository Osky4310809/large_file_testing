The Friendly Toast already operates in Kendall Square and Back Bay, with another restaurant in Portsmouth, NH, and Brookline is next on the list, according to Boston Restaurant Talk . The Friendly Toast has applied for a license to operate and serve alcohol at 1366 Beacon St., the former Yasu space . The restaurant would seat 142 people, according to a public hearing notice , and the matter will be addressed in a meeting on January 17. Eric Goodwin and business partner Scott Pulver purchased The Friendly Toast in 2013 and later opened the first Boston proper location. The Back Bay Friendly Toast celebrates its first anniversary this month . The proposed Brookline location would bring another breakfast option to a neighborhood that already draws morning crowds at Zaftigs, Regal Beagle, Brothers Restaurant, and Paris Creperie, among other spots near the proposed new restaurant. The Friendly Toast serves breakfast all day, along with burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads, and hearty entrees like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and burritos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:16:06.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
