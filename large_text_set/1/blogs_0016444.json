Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mum has described her terror after her previously healthy toddler became paralysed and mute after a family walk. \nLittle Archie Adams, from Southampton, Hampshire, was a normal little boy who was developing well until May 2015. \nBut suddenly, after a family day out to the local pub and a park, the 18-month-old lost control of his limbs and \"went floppy\". \nTwenty months on, his heart has stopped 12 times, he breathes through a tracheostomy tube and he is still unable to move. \nHeartbreakingly, doctors don’t believe he will ever move again. \nArchie's mum, Karen Adams, said: \"It all happened so quickly, it was within minutes. It was like a light switch went off. Archie Adams suddenly \"went floppy\" after a family day out to a local pub and a park (Photo: PA Real Life) \n\"He lost all control of all four limbs. They just went floppy like a newborn baby. \n“I was scared and felt lost. I didn’t know what was happening or what to think.” \nKaren, 35, has given up her job as a hospital catering assistant to care for her young son full-time. \nShe described how Archie was walking in the landing of their home when he fell limp and stopped making any sound.

Archie, now three, is pictured in a specially designed wheelchair after he was discharged from hospital (Photo: PA Real Life) \nIt was a terrible time for his parents. \n“Each time, the doctors said there was no guarantee they could bring him back and I’d think we were going to lose him,” Karen said. \n“I felt helpless, watching my child like that and knowing there was nothing we could do about it.” \nIn August 2015, Archie underwent five hours of open-heart surgery to have a pacemaker fitted. \nThis was the best option because his heart had stopped so many times by then. \n“I couldn’t believe this was happening to us,” Karen said.
