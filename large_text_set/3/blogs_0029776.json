Tim Ream and Matt Besler are candidates to step in for Brooks at left center back, while Lletget's midfield role likely will be filled by Alejandro Bedoya or Jermaine Jones. \nArena, however, hinted Monday he could make further adjustments. \n\"We won't have a lot of changes but we must have a couple at a minimum with the loss of Lletget and Brooks,\" Arena said at a news conference. \"There will be some changes, perhaps as many as four or five, but we'll see after training today before we finalize our team.\" \nHaving sat in the Hexagonal basement since opening CONCACAF's final stage of qualifying with back-to-back losses in November, the U.S. surged to fourth place with the victory against Honduras. \nA win over third-place Panama would move the U.S. into one of the three automatic qualifying slots, but Arena isn't getting ahead of himself in the wake of Friday's blowout. \n\"We are not overconfident,\" Arena said. \"We know we are playing against a very good opponent, and realize every time we play in a World Cup qualifying game on the road in CONCACAF it will be a very difficult match.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:15:51.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
