It brings them together to share stories, experience and opinions. It connects young and old, the ordinary that can become exceptional. \n\"Timeline is a programme that will do just that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T05:46:32.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
