And what they were talking about seemed very inappropriate to someone seated at a nearby table who took out his phone and began recording. \nA six-minute video captured the Bangor Public School teachers playing a party game about which student they would like to “kill, marry, or have sex with.” And did I mention they were being very loud? \nWhen the footage went online, rightful outrage from parents followed. In a town of only 2,000, the news travelled fast. There was a school board meeting and parents were even more shocked when they learned most of the teachers in the video wouldn’t be punished. \nOnly the school’s secretary, Patti Waite, and one of the teachers resigned. The others were only given written or verbal reprimands, according to IJ Review. That’s despite some of the parents claiming one of the kids they mentioned had special needs. \nThe lawyer representing the teachers said the police investigation determined no criminal activity took place and has no concern any teacher would act these things out. \n“We made our best assessment on the facts and reasonable minds can differ about things,” Attorney Robert Huber said. \nHuber assured that the parents seeking legal action against the teachers and the school board for lack of action would do no good. \nYes, these teachers were off the clock, and yes, they didn’t know they were being recorded, but in what world is it ever okay for teachers to talk about their students in this way? ESPECIALLY LOUDLY IN A VERY PUBLIC PLACE?? \nClick CONTINUE to see the disgusting video:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T20:17:52.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
