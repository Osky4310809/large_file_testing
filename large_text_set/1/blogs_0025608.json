A closed door. Anything could be on the other side of that door, man. Are you sure you even want to open it? \n\nAdvertisement \n\nResident Evil 7 has really good doors. It also has a lot of doors. You’ll encounter dozens of them as you make your way through the Baker family’s run-down mansion. There are metal doors that require sculpted keys, and wooden doors overgrown with horrific mold. There are doors adorned with dead scorpions, and doors marked with dead birds. There are secret doors, and doors that don’t actually look like doors, and doors that only open if you make the right shadow puppet on a nearby wall.\nIn order to open one of this game’s doors, you can either press the “use” button, which automatically opens it partway, or you can just physically push through. The latter option is easier and more intuitive, and you’re definitely going to have to shoulder your way through a few doors before you reach the credits. \nAdvertisement \n\nThe more I play, the more I’m struck by the variety of ways you can go through a door in this game. For example, you can open the door partway, then turn around and back your way into the next room:\n\nGIF You can push a door open, briefly hesitate, then soldier through:\n\n\nGIF You can barge through a sturdy set of double-doors, knocking them both open:\n\n\nGIF Or you can cautiously push a door partway open, shouldering it the rest of the way with your pistol at the ready:\n\n\nGIF It’s all really well done, and unusually responsive to your inputs. Because I can physically control the speed at which I push doors open, it didn’t take long for me to start thinking of them as actual doors.\n\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T22:16:00.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
