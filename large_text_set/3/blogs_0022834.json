It's certainly one they want to win. And well, generally, it's one the nation struggles to win, at least when it really matters. \nFortunately we've picked up on some very cynical potholes that will definitely thwart the German side and ensure England are victorious, happy and glorious. \nAt least we think they will... Giddy with excitement (Photo: REUTERS) Mesut Ozil \nInjuries will play a big part in the fixture, and Germany are missing a number of extremely important players. \nNow we're not saying a footballer being injured is something to be happy about. \nHonestly we're not. \nBut you all know what the likes of the injured Mesut Ozil is capable of, don't you? Mesut Ozil will miss the friendly (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nOk, things haven't exactly been going to plan for the Arsenal playmaker this season, but the opportunity to turn out for a different team would have hugely benefited him. \nAnd he would have almost certainly wanted to get one over the English who have criticised him this season, so England can count themselves lucky! Julian Draxler \nAlso injured is Julian Draxler, who has been a bit of a revelation since signing for PSG and stood out in their Champions league first leg win over Barcelona. Julian Draxler will not feature for Germany (Photo: Reuters) \nOK, we know what happened in the second leg, but again, Draxler is an attacking threat that England are fortunate not to be facing. Manuel Neuer \nAnother superstar - and we really mean superstar - carrying an injury is the one and only Manuel Neuer. \nEveryone knows just how good the German is between the sticks, but take a look at the above video to see what he is like in front of the opposition goal as well. Germany will miss Manuel Neuer (Photo: Stuart Franklin) \nHonestly, him off the pitch is a benefit for England in so many ways. \nAnd not just because the German defenders will have no one to chat with when they push up to the halfway line. Mario Gomez \nThe final injured player is Mario Gomez. \nThe 31-year-old Wolfsburg striker needs absolutely no introduction and has scored in each of his last three Bundesliga fixtures. Mario Gomez will not be playing against England (Photo: Getty) \nA lack of creativity in midfield, a lack of firepower, and a lack of the world's best goalkeeper could make all the difference for England. Stats don't lie \nThe game will be staged at Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. \nNow you'd think that this would benefit Germany - home advantage and all that. \nBut in fact, the Germans have lost their last three home matches against England when the game has been played on home soil. Disaster on the horizon? (Photo: REUTERS) \nAlso, different managers were behind these wins - Sven Goran Eriksson (5-1 in 2001), Fabio Capello (2-1 in 2008) and Roy Hodgson (3-2 in 2016). \nThat can mean only one thing, right!? poll loading Who will win when England play Germany? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:57:42.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
