She noted that the company found a workaround a few years ago after service slowed when baristas started warming La Boulange pastries for customers.\n\"We are now laser-focused on fixing this problem, but the nature of it - too much demand - is an operational challenge we have solved before and I can assure you we will solve again,\" Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said on a conference call.\nEarlier this week, Starbucks began adding one to two more baristas focused on mobile orders and payment at some of its top volume cafes during peak hours, spokeswoman Linda Mills told Reuters.\nExecutives are also rethinking work routines and internally testing text notifications that alert customers when their orders are ready, Mills added.\n\"There is some incremental labor, but it's mostly just using it more effectively,\" said AB Bernstein's Senatore.\nNews of the operational challenges came as Starbucks reported that traffic, also referred to as transactions, at its U.S. cafes slumped during the latest quarter.\nPart of that result was due to the fact that the company changed from a loyalty program based on transactions to one based on dollars spent. That switch was designed to address lines at pay stations, where service was slowing because the prior set-up encouraged some customers to game the system by purchasing multiple items via multiple transactions rather than just one.\nStephens analyst Will Slabaugh expects Starbucks to work the kinks out of mobile ordering and pay, but remains concerned about the broader restaurant demand environment.\n\"This was one of the worst retailing months of December that we've ever seen,\" Slabaugh said.\n(Reporting by Peter Henderson, editing by G Crosse)\nRead the original article on Reuters .
