It appears the House Intelligence chairman coordinated with the White House to protect Trump from embarrassment. by Devin Nunes, running away from questions about the chamber of secrets where he viewed classified documents. By Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images. The House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election has reportedly ground to a halt amid growing evidence that its Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, has been coordinating with the White House to protect the president from further embarrassment. Nunes first raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill when he broke protocol by holding a press conference to announce that he had learned from a source that Donald Trump and his associates may have been “incidentally” surveilled by the F.B.I. as part of the agency’s intelligence gathering on foreign targets. The news left Trump feeling vindicated, after F.B.I. director James Comey and National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers shot down the president’s repeated claims that he had been “wiretapped” by the previous administration. But it also left Democrats steaming: not only did Nunes run to the press rather than bring his evidence to the committee, he also briefed Trump about what he had learned—thereby communicating with a potential target of his own investigation. Later, it emerged that Nunes had met his “source” on the White House grounds, raising further suspicions that he was coordinating with the Trump administration. Democrats were already calling on Nunes to recuse himself when The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the California congressman had canceled a hearing set to include testimony from former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates under unusual circumstances. According to the Post, the White House had previously attempted to block Yates from testifying, given that she was expected to provide testimony that would contradict the White House about the circumstances surrounding the resignation of former national security adviser Mike Flynn. When it emerged that Yates planned to testify anyway, Nunes shut down the hearing. It seems easy enough to connect the dots. But according to reporting by The New Yorker ’s Ryan Lizza, there is also a smoking gun: \nThe White House and Nunes were clearly coördinating this strategy. A few days before the hearing, Trump seemed to offer a preview of it. In an interview on Fox News, the President said that he “will be submitting things” to Nunes’s committee “very soon,” and “perhaps speaking about this next week,” adding that “you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.” \nLast Monday morning, shortly before the start of the hearing, a senior White House official told me, “You’ll see the setting of the predicate. That’s the thing to watch today.” He suggested that I read a piece in The Hill about incidental collection. The article posited that if “Trump or his advisers were speaking directly to foreign individuals who were the target of U.S. spying during the election campaign, and the intelligence agencies recorded Trump by accident, it’s plausible that those communications would have been collected and shared amongst intelligence agencies.” \nThe White House clearly indicated to me that it knew Nunes would highlight this issue. “It’s backdoor surveillance where it’s not just incidental, it’s systematic,” the White House official said. “Watch Nunes today.” That afternoon, Nunes indeed accused disloyal intelligence officers of “unmasking” the Trump campaign officials whose conversations had been overheard. “It’s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates,” he said, but in giving Trump the slimmest of excuses for his explosive wiretapping claims, Nunes also gave Trump the ability to spin it into a blanket justification for his paranoia. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have suggested that Nunes could get the investigation back on track if he would only share his purported evidence with the rest of the committee, and divulge the name of the mysterious source he met on the White House grounds. “We would all benefit to just sit in the same room and talk about what he saw, who he received it from, and how it’s relevant to what we’re trying to do with the Russia investigation,” Representative Eric Swalwell said, according to Politico. “I think that would take a lot of the tension out of this process.” Nunes, however, has not made it clear whether he intends to share the information that he briefed Trump on, and has said he’ll “never” give up his source.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:16:00.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
