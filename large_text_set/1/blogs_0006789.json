In a 2015 blog post , she was asked how many children she wants to have with her hubby. \"Maybe two,\" she said. \"That way we aren't outnumbered.\" \nBut the couple wasn't in any rush to start their family after saying \"I do.\" \nConrad also explained to her followers how she was loving the honeymoon phase of their marriage. \"My favorite thing about being married is knowing that I have a partner in life that I get to do so many wonderful things with,\" she shared. \"Dreaming of the things we will do 20 years from now is so fun.\" \nConrad said the \"hardest\" aspect of marriage is compromise. \"You always want to be considerate of each other,\" she explained \"It's not just about you anymore.\" \nAnd now, it's not just about the two of them!
