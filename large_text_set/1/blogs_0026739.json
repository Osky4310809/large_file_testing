While announcing the squad for the one-off Test against Bangladesh, the committee also revealed the 15 names for the three-day warm-up tie that will be played in CCI, Mumbai from February 16-18, ahead of the four-match Test series between India and Australia. \nHardik, who has been featuring regularly in the limited-overs formats, is yet to make his Test debut for India but has been a part of the squad since the first Test against England. He is also a part of the A squad for the three-day game against Bangladesh, which will be led by Abhinav Mukund. \nWhile Priyank Panchal and Shreyas Iyer have been retained, Akhil Herwadkar and Ankit Bawne are the new additions. The duo replaces Mukund and Ishank Jaggi. Herwadkar averaged 42.45 in the Ranji season and Bawne averaged an impressive 57.25. Young sensation Rishabh Pant has also been retained in the squad but Ishan Kishan is the designated gloveman. \nWith Jayant Yadav picked for the Indian team, Karnataka spinner Krishnappa Gowtham replaces him as the third spinner apart from Shahbaz Nadeem and Kuldeep Yadav. The pace attack has a new look to it with Navdeep Saini, Ashok Dinda and Mohammed Siraj getting rewarded for their recent domestic form. None of these three pacers are part of the squad for the Bangladesh game. Rahul Singh and Baba Indrajith have replaced wicketkeeper Nitin Saini and allrounder Vijay Shankar. \nIndia A squad : Hardik Pandya (C), Akhil Herwadkar, Priyank Kirit Panchal, Shreyas Iyer, Ankit Bawne, Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan (WK), Shahbaz Nadeem, Krishnappa Gowtham, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Ashok Dinda, Mohammed Siraj, Rahul Singh, Baba Indrajith © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:48:50.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
