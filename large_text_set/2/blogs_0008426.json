In the summer of 2016. Stefan Rousseau / PA Archive/PA Images ID: 10504919 Jeremy Corbyn has announced his latest shadow cabinet reshuffle after the fallout from this week’s Brexit vote , meaning more than a quarter of all Labour MPs have held a shadow cabinet job since he became leader in September 2015.\nBut how many of the current line-up can you actually recognise?\nWhich of these people is Nia Griffith, shadow defence secretary? The MP on the right is Nia Griffith, who is the actual shadow defence secretary. The one on the left is Brentford and Isleworth MP Ruth Cadbury.\nWhich of these is shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey? The MP on the left is Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is being tipped to be the person who will be tipped to become a person who is tipped as Labour leader if Jeremy Corbyn chooses to step down. The MP on the right is Angela Rayner.\nWhich of these MPs is shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams? Debbie Abrahams is on the right. She’s the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth. The person on the left is Melanie Onn, MP for Great Grimsby, who was not in the shadow cabinet when we last checked. Which of these is Dave Anderson, shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland and also shadow secretary of state for Scotland? Dave Anderson is the MP on the left. The MP for Blaydon in the North East of England stepped in to become Labour’s Westminster spokesperson on Scottish issues after Ian Murray, Labour’s only remaining Scottish MP, quit the frontbench in protest at Corbyn. The other man is Easington MP Grahame Morris.\nWhich of these is shadow communities secretary Teresa Pearce? Pearce, who is Corbyn’s fourth shadow environment minister in the last two years, is on the right. The other MP is shadow foreign minister Catherine West.\nWhich of these is shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner? The man on the left is Gardiner. The man on the right is Kelvin Hopkins MP, a long-term backer of Jeremy Corbyn who briefly served as shadow culture secretary when the last shadow cabinet before the last shadow cabinet resigned en masse.\nWhich of these is shadow Welsh secretary Christina Rees? Rees is on the left. The Neath MP also played competitive squash for Wales and is not to be confused with fellow MP Helen Jones.\nWhich of these people is shadow environment minister Sue Hayman? That’s her, on the left. Hayman is definitely not to be confused fellow Labour MP Barbara Keeley who is, perhaps surprisingly, on the right.\nWhich is these MPs is shadow Treasury secretary Peter Dowd? If you clicked on Dowd, MP for Bootle, rather than Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham, you’re doing quite well.\nWhich of these is leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn? Hardest of the lot.\nCan You Recognise The Shadow Cabinet Minister? You are a normal person. Your ability to recognise members of the Labour shadow front bench is abysmal. This suggests you are a normal person with a normal life.\nYou have spent too long reading about politics. OK, so it’s not a perfect result but it’s pretty good. You really need to get out more.\nYou are Jeremy Corbyn. The only explanation for scoring this highly is that you actually are the leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition.\n  10504570", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T12:19:45.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
