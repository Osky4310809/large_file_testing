(AP) – Bird-welfare volunteers are trying to locate a bald eagle that’s been photographed in Pennsylvania with a leg-hold trap clamped to a talon. \nWildlife rehabilitator Wendy Ebersole Looker told The York Dispatch on Tuesday she will care for the injured raptor if it can be caught. \nThe bird was photographed Sunday in Bonneauville, a town about five miles from Gettysburg in south-central Pennsylvania. \nThe photographer, Susan Boardman, says she watched the eagle on the ground for about 10 minutes before seeing the leg trap, attached a long chain, when it started to fly away. \nBoardman says the eagle appeared to struggle to fly. \nWATCH LIVE: Pittsburgh Bald Eagle Camera \nLooker says eagles need their talons to hunt, eat, perch and defend themselves. She tells the newspaper infection could be a problem. \n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
