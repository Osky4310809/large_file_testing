Moscow’s main aim is to keep Sweden out of Nato, the institute says. Photograph: Fredrik Sandberg/AFP/Getty Images   06.00 GMT Last modified on   06.02   \nSweden’s most authoritative foreign policy institute has accused Russia of using fake news, false documents and disinformation as part of a coordinated campaign to influence public opinion and decision-making in the Scandinavian country. \nThe Swedish Institute of International Affairs said in a comprehensive study that Sweden had been the target of “a wide array of active measures” aimed at “hampering its ability to generate public support in pursuing its policies”. \nThe study said Russia had used misleading reports on its state-run news website Sputnik, and public interventions by Russian politicians in Swedish domestic affairs, as well as more covert methods. \nThese included forged documents and fabricated news items that appeared in Swedish media and were subsequently picked up by Sputnik and “other sources of Russian public diplomacy” and broadcast to an international audience, it said. \nThe report admitted it was impossible for researchers to establish exactly where and how the forgeries and fake stories had been generated, but said they were consistent with Russia’s strategic objectives.

Most first appeared on “obscure Russian and/or Swedish-language websites”. Some, purportedly from Swedish decision-makers, used fake letterheads to increase the impression of authenticity, it said. \nTen were concerned directly with Swedish affairs, according to the report, which examined three in detail. One was a letter in February 2015, purportedly from Sweden’s defence minister to the chief executive of the arms manufacturer BAE Systems Bofors, discussing arms sales to Ukraine. \nAnother, supposedly from Sweden’s chief international public prosecutor, rejected a non-existent request from Ukraine to drop a case against a Swedish citizen accused of war crimes. The third detailed a fake conspiracy between Sweden and Nato to secretly send weapons to Islamic State via Turkey. \nThe study said the forgeries contained enough factual and other mistakes to enable authorities to declare them fakes – but not before they had been widely circulated on social media, Swedish and Russian websites and, in one case, mainstream media. \nIn “their level of detail and the instrumental exploitation of non-household names”, the forgeries and fake news stories “suggest the originators of the documents have access to comprehensive intelligence on Swedish society”, it said.

That’s why information and cybersecurity is part of this strategy,” Löfven told the TT news agency. \nThe Kremlin has denied claims it interfered in the US elections, hitting out at what it says are “baseless allegations substantiated with nothing” and claiming the assertions by the American intelligence agencies are a political witch-hunt. \nAn intelligence report declassified on Friday said Vladimir Putin had personally “ordered an influence campaign” during the US election to tip the balance in Donald Trump’s favour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:05:16.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
