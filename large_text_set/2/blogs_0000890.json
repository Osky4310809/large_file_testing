Harris a junior at Keystone Oaks High School fills water into the hand made water system for plants. By Deana Carpenter \nFirst-year teacher Maddie Kay has transformed a little-used storage room at Keystone Oaks High School into a green learning space to teach environmental science to students. \n“I found this room when I was rummaging around,” said Ms. Kay, who also teaches chemistry. \nShe said she started the year teaching environmental science in a more traditional way, lecturing and having the students take notes. \nOne day, she gave the students a free period and talked with them about the direction of the class. \n“I realized these kids would want to do something more hands-on,” she said, and that’s when she came up with the idea to create a “green space” for learning. \n“We’re ecstatic about what Maddie has done,” high school principal Keith Hartbauer said. “She’s made learning relevant for a lot of kids who would have shut down otherwise. This group of kids seems to do really well with these types of activities.” \nThe storage room, which is almost as large as a classroom, has a windowed ceiling and was used as a greenhouse at one point about 20 years ago. But when she first discovered it, Ms. Kay said, it was in bad shape with chipped paint, a nonworking sink and science materials from more than two decades ago. \nThis past semester, Ms. Kay’s class cleaned and painted the room and students from the school’s wood shop class made at table for it. \nShe is using the room to teach students about the science of plants, including aquaponics, which combines the raising of fish with the cultivating of plants in water. The fish provide nutrients and fertilizer to the plants. \nMs. Kay is well-versed in aquaponics. She did her student teaching at the Fanny Edel Falk Laboratory School at the University of Pittsburgh, which has a large aquaponics system. \nAt Keystone Oaks, the students are raising mosquitofish, a small fish. In large-scale aquaponics operations, Ms. Kay said, large fish like tilapia are farmed. \nIn early December, students planted herbs such as basil, chives and oregano in traditional soil beds as well as in an aquaponics bed. \nIn addition to learning how to care for plants, Ms. Kay said, the class did a unit on water recycling and conservation and how to effectively and efficiently water plants. In the room, some plants are being watered with drip-style irrigation using tubes, and some are being watered with subsurface irrigation using water bottles. \n“It’s just nice to have a different experience,” senior Domenic Nerone said of the class, which is an elective. \n“Everyone takes core classes, but not everyone gets to see things about the environment,” he said. \n“I like that it’s hands on,” added senior Logan Cipcic. \nAnother senior, Olivia Leaps, described the class as “really fun.” \nIn the future, Ms. Kay said the goal is to have other classes use the room. Next semester, she will collaborate with other departments in the school. \nStudents will make a 3-D model of the room in a computer-aided drafting class, and another class will use a 3-D printer to make netting to be used for a larger aquaponics system in the upcoming semester. Ms. Kay said she also wants to collaborate with the wood shop class to make an herb wall. \n“Our goal is to use the room for hands-on activities,” she said. \nDeana Carpenter, freelance writer: suburbanliving@post-gazette.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:54:08.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
