Posted 8 hours ago 27 \nHey, everyone! We're here again with the second issue of our Complete Guide rubric. We were really happy to see the positive response to the \" Welcome to the Jungle \" article from you, guys, so we took your feedback into consideration and hope you'll enjoy this one even more. Again, tell us what you think, express your ideas and opinions on how Completed Guide should look like in the comment section below. \nToday, we'd like to commemorate one of UG's most favorite guitarists Dimebag Darrell by making a complete guide to Pantera's arguably most famous song - \"Cowboys From Hell.\" \nPantera 'Cowboys From Hell' \nWriters: Dimebag Darrell, Vinnie Paul, Phil Anselmo, Rex Brown Producer: Terry Date Album: Cowboys From Hell (1990) (UG Score is 9.3) Released: July 24, 1990 \nVH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs - #25 Story behind the song \nThe lyrics of the song focus on the fact that Texas has never been associated with successful metal bands and Pantera say in an ironic manner that they are going to bring an end to this. \nHere's a part of the Metal Hammer interview where band members tell about the inspiration and recording for \"Cowboys From Hell\": \nVinnie Paul (drums): \"While we were pounding away, Megadeth called Dime and asked him to audition for them. Dave Mustaine actually offered him the job. They offered him health insurance, a Nike endorsement, and lots of money. But he came back to Texas and said, 'Look, man, I would only join Megadeth if they wanted to hire you, and they already got a drummer. So let's fuckin' knuckle down and make this thing happen.' I think that really made everyone focus. After we finished 'Power Metal,' we looked at ourselves and said, 'You know what? These fancy clothes and all this crazy hair ain't playing music for us, we are.' So, we decided to drop the image and focus more on the music, and kick ass as much as possible.\" \nPhil Anselmo (lead vocals): \"I showed them the fucking path, man. Dimebag came over to the first house I lived at in Texas in early '88, and I said, 'Look here. We're gonna smoke a bowl and you're gonna sit down and listen to a song.' So we smoked, and then I put on the vinyl version of 'At Dawn They Sleep' from Slayer's 'Hell Awaits.' Dime sat there and stared at the turntable, and by about the middle of the song, that big, curly head started to move a little, and by the end of the song, he's like, 'Damn, son. That's badass!' So right then and there, I had really broken some headway. 'Cowboys From Hell' is an anthemic statement that's a bit cheesy. It's the kind of thing I tried to avoid in the future. Shattered is the same way. It was like, 'OK, nuclear war, great.' It's been done before. So I decided to take the realistic route - to sing about circumstance that other people can relate to. That, to me, was the way to get to people, instead of writing about dragons or serial killers.\" \nRex Brown (bass, backing vocals): \"That whooshing noise at the beginning was a loop we made for Dime to play over, and it was very repetitious and very fuckin' annoying for a long while. He developed that whole riff over that. And that riff is a little form of in-the-box blues scaling. We were always down the street watching all these great blues guys in the studio, because Vinnie and Darrell's dad was an engineer there. We'd sneak in the studio and sit way underneath the board and listen to these amazing players. And I think that's where Dime got the bluesy groove.\" Music Videos \nThe official video, which was directed by Paul Rachman, was recorded in a Dallas club that the band often called \"The Basement.\" \n\"Deluxe\" and \"Ultimate\" editions of the album \"Cowboys from Hell\" contain Demo version of the song which was recorded in 1989. \nOne of the last live videos: Gear and settings Guitar \nDarrell \"Dimebag\" Abbott used his 1981 blue Dean From Hell guitar to record \"Cowboys From Hell.\" He used this guitar on all the songs that were in standard tuning. \nDime's Dean From Hell is equipped with Bill Lawrence XL500 pickup in the bridge and a Seymour Duncan '59 in the neck. Effects \nDime's rig was simple and he used very few effects. His effect chain for this song looks like this: Guitar - Jim Dunlop Cry Baby (UG Score 9) - Furman PQ-4 (later PQ-3) - MXR 6 Band Equalizer - Rocktron Guitar Silencer - Randall RG100H; and in the loop: MXR Flanger/ Doubler. \nDarrell used a wah pedal which was Jim Dunlop Cry Baby which was later replaced by his signature Dunlop Crybaby From Hell (UG score 9.2) wah pedal for achieving squealing tones in his solo. \nDimebag Darrel presents his signature Dunlop 'Crybaby From Hell' \nThe interplay between the MXR 6-Band EQ and Furman was less about tone and more about getting the maximum gain out of the two without overloading the PQ-4 (PQ-3). \nA total gain analysis by frequency shows the following gain increases: Low Freqs: +18dB (9 from PQ3, 9 from MXR) Mid Freqs: +30dB (12 from PQ3, 18 from MXR) High Freqs: +30db(12 from PQ3, 18 from MXR) \nIn order to correctly match the gain levels from the MXR and PQ3 while reaching an absolute gain, we have to concentrate on the high and midrange frequencies. Too much input into low frequencies overloads the PQ3. So, the high and midrange frequencies should be bumped massively. \nFurman PQ3 settings", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:20:25.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
