As compared with those taking a placebo pill, more patients taking Noctiva were able to cut their bathroom visits in half, and had more nights where they only woke up once—or not at all—to pee. \nNow, nocturnal polyuria is only one cause of waking up at night to urinate. It can also be caused by a variety of conditions, including uncontrolled diabetes , congestive heart failure, certain medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. (Thinking about getting screened for prostate cancer? Here’s what you need to know about PSA testing .) \nNoctiva is only FDA approved to treat nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, so your doctor will need to see if you have that condition before prescribing the drug. He or she should also check to make sure you don’t have any underlying conditions that could be causing your nighttime bathroom breaks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:35:11.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
