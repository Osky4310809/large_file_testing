It's not real!\" \n“I feel like I’m going crazy!” \n“It’s like things you’d never expect are happening everywhere.” \nWhile these lines are commonplace in the horror genre, you may have also uttered them last year. \nThe hilarious and disturbing 2016: The Movie parody trailer imagines if the year 2016 were, indeed, a horror film. When a couple (Anna Gilcrest and Brian Huther) moves into a new house, things don't feel quite right. Cue an onslaught of confusing, maddening, and downright horrifying events: a barrage of seemingly never-ending celebrity deaths, exploding phones, a demogogue being elected as U.S. president, and— \n“England just left Europe.” \n“Why?” \n“Nobody knows. They just.…left.” \nFriend Dog Studios , the production company responsible for the parody trailer, spared no horror trope. The video even ends with a child singing \"Auld Lang Syne\" in that ominous death lullaby tune so frequently heard in the genre. \nOf course, it's worth noting that 2016 was not the most dismal year in modern history. (You could argue that any year between 1939-45 earns that spot.) But this trailer certainly does justice to the feelings of helplessness, betrayal, and veritable shock that many experienced in droves this year. And with that depressing finale involving Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, it's hard not to imagine that 2016 was designed by some evil mastermind with a knack for tragedy and irony—like, say, a horror director.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:17:21.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
