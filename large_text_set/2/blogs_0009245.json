Fried, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai whose research focuses on fat storage.\nHere’s what those bulges can mean for your heart, metabolism and more.\nTUBBY TUMMY \nExtra weight around the midsection is more likely to be visceral fat, which surrounds the body’s inner organs, than subcutaneous fat, which lies immediately under the skin. That means belly fat will likely “increase inflammation in the body, leading to Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, to name a few [health issues],” says Dr. Kristen Gill Hairston, medical director of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Center at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center .\nFried suggests lying down to tell what type of fat you carry around your waist. “If you lie on your back, and your fat doesn’t stick up, it’s probably just under the skin,” or subcutaneous, she says. “If it sort of sticks up and looks like you’re pregnant, then it’s likely visceral.”\nLOVE HANDLES \nLove handles and other flabby areas are more likely to be subcutaneous fat, which carries less of a risk to your health, says Hairston. Still, those extra pounds can lead to issues such as osteoarthritis and sleep apnea, she cautions.\nTHICK THIGHS \nNo thigh gap? No problem.\n“If you carry fat in your butt or in your thighs, that is actually associated with better health, lower risk of cardiac disease or diabetes,” says Fried. The same thing applies to men and women, although women are more likely to have a “pear” shape.\nShe says experts are still unsure of why this is the case but that lower-body fat isn’t usually stored in places where it can do damage, such as the muscle or liver.\n“Women should be happy about fat on their thighs,” says Fried. “It keeps them healthy!”\nCHUNKY ARMS \nCarrying weight in your upper body is generally less safe than storing it in your lower body, says Fried. Chunky arms could mean that excess fat is stuck in your muscles — this is called ectopic fat, she says, and can cause problems such as insulin resistance — but Fried cautions that no studies have looked specifically at arm fat.\nBULKY BACK \n“The fat on your back is usually associated with a big belly,” says Fried, meaning it likely bears the same risks as fat on your midsection.\nALL OVER \nCarrying an extra layer of fat anywhere on your body can put extra strain on your heart, driving up your risk of various diseases.\n“Remember that extra weight, anywhere, can contribute to joint pain, sleep apnea and decreased stamina,” says Hairston.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:58:05.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
