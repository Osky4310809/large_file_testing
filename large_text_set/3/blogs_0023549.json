Both were snapped in the snow in Sweden undergoing cold weather testing, and the co-developed roadster-coupe duo were parked strategically side-by-side and back-to-back. \nUnfortunately, this Supra mule wears no less camouflage than the ones we’ve seen before, and there are no new details to be seen. Like the previous set of close-up petrol station shots , it’s obvious that the reborn Japanese sports car is inspired by the FT-1 concept from Detroit 2014, with rounded headlights, a protruding F1-style nosecone and triple air intakes in the bumper. \nAlthough there are lines on the bonnet that look like typical shutlines, the real thing appears to be a clamshell unit à la the BMW Z3. Along the sides, the 17-inch BMW alloys hide big brakes. There’s also a wraparound front windscreen design that extends to the side windows, while prominent rear haunches cover the rear wheels. \nMoving rearward, the Supra features a hatch instead of a conventional bootlid, and the slim tail lights are reminiscent of both the FT-1 and the revered Mk4 Supra . At the bottom are twin exhaust exits and cutouts for what looks like a centrally-mounted fog light – again, like the FT-1. \nWe’ve seen the Supra mule’s interior before , and it appears to have been carried over from the BMW Z5, with the German brand’s signature three-spoke steering wheel, freestanding centre display, semi-virtual instrument cluster and climate control switchgear all present. Perhaps the production car will have a unique Toyota cabin – here’s hoping. \nUnder the bonnet, the hot Toyota is expected to be powered by a range of BMW-derived inline four- and six-cylinder turbocharged engines, with the most powerful hybrid model getting capacitors and four-wheel drive. The cars are also tipped to benefit from Munich’s expertise in carbon fibre construction, joining the likes of the BMW i3 , i8 and G11 7 Series in incorporating the material in their architecture. \nThere’s speculation that both cars will be assembled by Magna Steyr in Austria. Late 2017 or early 2018 debut? Can’t wait for the second chapter of The Three Brothers !
