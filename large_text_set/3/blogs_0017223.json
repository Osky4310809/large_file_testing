It's been hypothesized that this may be due to exposure to repeated hits to the head. Last November, it was announced that another former pro football player diagnosed with ALS -- Kevin Turner -- had the most advanced stage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) when he died, and that it had brought on his ALS. CTE is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head trauma. In his letter, Clark says: \"I've been asked if playing football caused this. I don't know for sure. But I certainly suspect it did. And I encourage the NFLPA and the NFL to continue working together in their efforts to make the game of football safer, especially as it relates to head trauma.\" In 2012, 80 concussion-related lawsuits on behalf of more than 2,000 NFL players were combined and filed as a single class-action lawsuit in federal court. The players accused the NFL not only of negligence but of failing to notify them of the link between concussions and brain injuries. Turner was a lead plaintiff on this complaint. Three years later, a federal judge gave final approval to a settlement in the lawsuit. By this time, over 5,000 former NFL players had filed suit and were eligible for the settlement. This agreement provided up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma. Photos: Athletes and CTE Former pro football player Kevin Turner, shown here during a 1998 NFL game, had the most advanced stage of CTE when he died in March at the age of 46. Dr. Ann McKee of Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation said that Turner's CTE brought on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. CTE stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head trauma. Scientists believe repeated head trauma can cause CTE, a progressive degenerative disease of the brain. Symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation, but scientists can definitively diagnose it only after death.

Smith played for the Baltimore Colts, the Oakland Raiders and the Houston Oilers. Hide Caption 3 of 22 Photos: Athletes and CTE Former Minnesota Vikings linebacker Fred McNeill died in November 2015 due to complications from ALS. However, an autopsy confirmed that he suffered from CTE. What makes McNeill's case even more remarkable, though, is that he was potentially the first to be diagnosed while alive. Doctors used an experimental new technology to examine his brain. Hide Caption 4 of 22 Photos: Athletes and CTE Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, a former NFL MVP who died in July 2015, suffered from CTE, researchers at Boston University said.

Pathology reports show he probably had CTE. Hide Caption 6 of 22 Photos: Athletes and CTE Hall of Fame offensive lineman Mike Webster was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression, and bone and muscle pain. Hide Caption 7 of 22 Photos: Athletes and CTE The death of 36-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk put the link between football and CTE in the national spotlight. Strzelczyk was killed in a 2004 car crash crash after a 40-mile high-speed chase with police in New York.

He died after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fianc√©e. His young age prompted concern over how quickly athletes start to suffer from CTE.

Although the antifreeze caused swelling of the brain, football-related brain injuries were a contributing factor to his death.

Testing found that the damage to his brain was similar to that of an elderly Alzheimer's patient.

Finding a cure Clark's letter focuses on fighting the disease and the support provided to him by his family, friends and former 49ers teammates. \"Every single one of my 49ers teammates that has contacted me has said whatever I need, anytime I need it, they will help. That's just the kind of guys they are. They were so giving as players and now they are the same as friends,\" he said. He wants to believe: Doctor searching for rare ALS reversals \"I'm not having a press conference or doing any interviews. That time will come. Right now, I've got work to do. I've got to devote all my energy preparing for this battle and I would hope you can respect my family's privacy as I begin this challenge. My ultimate hope is that eventually I can assist in finding a cure for ALS, which disrupts the lives of so many and their loved ones.\" The ALS association estimate that more than 6,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the US each year, with 20,000 living with it at any one time. There is no cure.
