Daisy is fine, but her mother was unexpectedly hit with an anesthesiology bill for almost $3,000. \nBaby Daisy. CBS News \n“At no point in time were we ever notified that the anesthesiologist didn’t participate in our plan or were we given any choice,” she said. \nSchade is not alone.

CBS News \n“I’ve spent hours and hours and hours on the phone with the provider, with the insurance company, appeal after appeal has been denied,” she said. \nYour primary care provider -- if you have one -- can be your advocate with an insurance company or healthcare facility.
