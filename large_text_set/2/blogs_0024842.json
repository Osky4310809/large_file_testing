Ryans, 32, spent 10 seasons in the NFL with the Houston Texans ( 2006-11) and Philadelphia Eagles (2012-15), registering 735 tackles, 13.5 sacks, 10 fumble recoveries and seven interceptions in his career. Ryans was a two-time Pro Bowler and was the Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2006. And he'll also be working for a familiar coach, per Joe Fann of 49ers.com: Joe Fann @Joe_Fann Cool note about 49ers coaching staff. DC Robert Saleh coached DeMeco Ryans (former rookie of the year) in Houston. Now they work together. His position with the 49ers may be the first stop in what ultimately becomes a long and successful coaching career. Former 49ers head coach Chip Kelly envisions Ryans becoming a head coach someday, per Dave Zangaro of CSN Philly: Dave Zangaro @DZangaroCSN In the 2016 NFL Info guide, Chip Kelly named DeMeco Ryans as a player who would make a great HC. Now, he's on the next 49ers staff. https://t.co/TGx0cfDr3c 2/21/2017, 9:38:09 PM Along with Ryans, head coach Kyle Shanahan added six other coaches to the staff on Tuesday: John Benton (offensive line), Daniel Bullocks (assistant defensive backs), Michael Clay (strength and conditioning assistant), Stan Kwan (assistant special teams), Vince Oghobaase (assistant defensive line) and Adam Stenavich (assistant offensive line). They'll join a new-look 49ers organization being led by general manager John Lynch and head coach Shanahan. The 49ers have failed to reach the postseason in the past three years and were a putrid 7-25 over the past two seasons, so the new regime will be tasked with turning around the proud franchise.
