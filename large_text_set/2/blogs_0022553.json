The teen told Mersereau, 51, that he didnâ€™t egg his home, and witnesses told police that Mersereau grabbed the boy, pushed him and punched him twice. \nThe officer who responded to the incident said Mersereau was intoxicated and became belligerent. He was arrested and posted $3,000 bail the next day. \nMersereau, who played for the Jets from 1987 to 1993, finished his career with 19 sacks and might be best remembered for a collision that left teammate Dennis Byrd paralyzed. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:10:31.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
