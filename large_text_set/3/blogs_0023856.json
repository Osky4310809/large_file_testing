Given that the Liberal majority in the House of Commons supports M-103, it is certain to pass.\nKhalid seeks to accomplish three things with M-103: First, that the House “condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination;” second, that the House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage be instructed to study the issue of “eliminating systemic racism and religious discrimination including Islamophobia;” and, finally; that the federal government collect data on hate crimes for further study.\nRelated Liberal Jewish and Muslim MPs condemn imams who called for the death of Jews Liberals win key Commons vote while Tories are accused of creating ‘waves of Islamophobia’ Conservatives accuse Liberal government of playing politics with Islamophobia motion The motion is not a piece of proposed legislation. Indeed, many opponents of the motion and commentators often refer incorrectly to M-103 as “a bill.” It is not and, should it pass in a House of Commons vote, it would create no new laws nor would it change any laws.\nAnd yet, of the 35 or so people protesting against M-103 Tuesday at lunch, many shouted that they believed the adoption of M-103 will be the first step towards stifling free speech and establishing Sharia Law in Canada.\nA handful of the anti-M-103 protestors were wearing “Soldiers of Odin Canada” sweatshirts.\nSoldiers of Odin, on its Facebook page, says it is a non-profit dedicated to defending the charter of rights and freedoms but its critics allege it is an anti-immigrant, anti-refugee group.\nThe mob that was counter-protesting the anti-M-103 protestors called them “Nazis” and “fascists” and changed “Soldiers of Odin, go back to Sweden.”\nDAVID AKIN/National Post A \"Soldiers of Odin\" member eyes a counter-protest on Parliament Hill on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 There were only about 25 in the counter-demonstration, all of them wearing balaclavas or otherwise covering their face. One man, who would not identify himself, said they were concealing their identifies from the anti-M-103 protestors because they believed they would be harassed by the Soldiers of Odin if their identies were revealed.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:50:01.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
