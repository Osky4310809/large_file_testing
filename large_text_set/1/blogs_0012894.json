Image: Damian Corrigan Ten Things to Do in Macarena \nAn historically important district of Seville, Macerena is now a poorer part of town with less tourists walking round it - but it's still worth a visit. \n1. Museo de Bellas Artes \nThis is Seville's fine art museum. Art from the Gothic era to present day can be found in this 17th century museum, including works by the likes of Goya and Murillo. \n2. Basilica de Macarena \nAn important church with a famous Pedro Roldán statue of the Virgen de la Macarena. \n3. Eslava Tapas Bar \nEslava is one of my very favorite tapas bars in Seville. It's not a very big place, with the menu written on a blackboard behind the bar (in Spanish only, I'm afraid). But everything is good - pick anything. If you don't like it, you've only wasted between two and three euros. \n4. Muralla Arabe \nThe Muralla Arabe translates as 'Arab Wall', but it would be better to describe it as the 'Moorish Wall'. One of the oldest sights in Seville. \n5. Templo Omium & Market \nThis is one of my favorite parts of Seville. An understated church, a lively market and a number of modest bars full of families who spill out onto the streets to enjoy the afternoon. \n6. Basilica del Gran Poder \nA grandiose basilica, famous among locals for the 'Señor de Sevilla' statue. Some of the most important artefacts from the Semana Santa processions live here during the rest of the year. \n7. Alameda de Hercules \nA vast plaza/street near the Macarena part of town, where Seville's youth tend to congregate in the bars and cafes. \n8. La Yerba Tapas Bar \nLa Yerba is an excellent tapas bar on a small residential street outside of the center. Eat great tapas away from the usual throngs of tourists. \n9. Sevilla Dance Center \nA successful dance school in Seville's old town. \n10. Hospital de las Cinco Llagas \nThe old Hospital de las Cinco Llargas, also known as the \"Hospital de la Sangre\", is the home to the Andalusian parliament. Dating from the mid-16th century, the hospital was in use until the 1970s. After more than a decade in disuse, the hospital was renovated. It became the seat of the Andalusian parliament in 2003. Plaza de España, Seville. Image: Damian Corrigan Eight Things to Do Near Plaza de España \nSeville's Plaza de España is a little out of the center but's well worth the trip (and it's really not that far, either). There are plenty more things to do to make the walk worth it. \n1. Plaza de España \nEasily the most beautiful and extravagant plaza in Seville. \n2. Parque de Maria Luisa \nAttractive park next to Plaza de España, with a good (free) botanical garden. \n3. Teatro Lope de Vega \nBeautiful opera house. Nice for a quick look around when passing by, even better to see a show there. \n4. Museo Arqueologico \nSeville's archeological museum can be found at the far end of the Parque de Maria Luisa. If you don't want to visit the exhibits inside, the neo-Renaissance exterior is still worth a visit. \n5. Museo Militar \nLearn about Spain's military history in this museum housed inside the buildings around Plaza de España. \n6. Museo de Artes y Costumbres Populares \nOpposite the archeological museum is this museum of popular art and customs. Regular flamenco shows are among the attractions here. \n7. Pabellon Domecq and Pabellon Real \nCheck out two of the remaining pavilions from the 1929 Iberoamerican Exposition. The Pabellon Real is the more interesting of the two. \n8. Old Tobacco Factory \nAll tobaco that entered Spain (and much of Europe) from South America used to pass through this factory, which is now a building of the University of Seville. Seville's Bullring. Image: Damian Corrigan Five Things to Do in Arenal \nArenal is the area between the cathedral and the waterfront. Most tourists pass it by despite it being so close to the more famous sights. \n1. See a Bullfight \nSeville's bullring is one of the most famous in Spain and the only one that is not circular. \n2. Torre de Oro and the Waterfront \nAn 800-year-old watchtower on the riverfront in Seville. \n3. Restaurante Enrique Becerra One of the finest tapas bars in Seville! \n4. Old Royal Shipyards \nSeville's 13th century royal shipyards \n5. Hospital de la Caridad \nA highly-decorated 17th century hospital and church. The open road can be beautiful when driving in Spain.
