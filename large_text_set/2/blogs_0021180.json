There'll be aspects you tire of, pet peeves you can’t kick. \nI’m talking about me and broccoli rabe, but you likely deal with a similar situation (kale, perhaps?). I buy rabe every week for its mineral undertones and bitter brace, but also because it lasts a while in the fridge. I can then spend many days thinking about how I want to eat it this week so that it’s not like how I ate it last week (blanched then sautéed with olive oil, chile, and garlic). I’m not sick of broccoli rabe—I’m sick of the one way I like to cook it. Advertisement Broccoli Rabe Goma-ae by Ali Slagle \nOur love was recently rekindled, though, one night at a chic, candlelit, secret Brooklyn bar called Karasu . They served broccoli rabe goma-ae . My beloved was hardly recognizable: Cold, in an acid-sweet soy dressing, a nutty coating of cracked sesame seeds, and with a river of another, creamier miso dressing over top. And while spinach goma-ae, which means \"dressed in sesame sauce,\" is fairly common in Japanese restaurants and home kitchens, Yael Peet, one of the chefs at Karasu, said they hadn't seen rabe goma-ae until their own. \n“Goma-ae is usually made with toasted sesame seeds that are ground in a suribachi (a Japanese mortar that has grooves) until the seeds begin to release their oils but aren't quite paste,” Miyoko Schinner, a prolific vegan chef and author who also runs an artisan vegan cheese company , told me. “It's then combined with soy sauce, sugar, mirin or sake, maybe some dashi.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:32:53.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
