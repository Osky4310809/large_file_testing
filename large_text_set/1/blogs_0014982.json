As drama brews surrounding The Weeknd and Selena Gomez, Bella Hadid is spending time with family. Just a few days after her ex was spotted kissing the \"Can't Keep My Hands to Myself\" singer during a PDA-filled date night in Los Angeles, Hadid stepped out with her sister, Gigi Hadid, and mom Yolanda in NYC for a family dinner. Photo: Splash News The trio were all smiles as they headed to dinner at Nobu, where Bella shared a snap of her mom smiling as she opened a birthday present. Photo: Snapchat Gigi posted a sweet Instagram tribute to Yolanda on Jan. 11, her actual birthday, sharing a throwback photo with a heartfelt caption. “To the most compassionate, supportive, loving, intelligent, creative SUPERmom in the world.. I am so lucky to have someone like you to look up to,” she wrote. “Thank you for everything (especially @bellahadid & @anwarhadid), I love you so much! Happy Birthday!!!” A photo posted by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Jan 11, 2017 at 9:02am PST WATCH: Bella Hadid Unfollows Selena Gomez on Instagram After Singer Is Spotted Kissing The Weeknd -- See the Pics!
