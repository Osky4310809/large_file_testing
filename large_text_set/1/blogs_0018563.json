The Stars made the semi-finals too, at the expense of their cross-town rivals Melbourne Renegades. They will travel to Perth to face the Scorchers on Tuesday. \nLuke Wright lived up to his reputation as the man who comes to life on the MCG's biggest nights with his second successive half-century, but the Stars - missing six first-choice players to injury and international call-ups - fell away after he was dismissed. Chasing 157 for a place in the semi-finals, the Sixers then pulled off an impressive come-from-behind win. \nTheir top six struggled and it looked like their season was over, but Sean Abbott and Johan Botha picked their targets effectively to add 59 in 28 balls. With the scores level, Botha was caught and bowled by Scott Boland, but it was too little, too late for the Stars. Ben Dwarshius edged the next ball for four to complete the chase. \nFull report to follow \nWill Macpherson writes on cricket for the Guardian , ESPNcricinfo and All Out Cricket . @willis_macp © ESPN Sports Media Ltd.
