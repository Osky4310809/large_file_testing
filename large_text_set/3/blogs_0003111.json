The Red Raiders went from a 7-5 regular season the year before to 5-7, missing a bowl game, and at one point losing a game to Iowa State by 56 points. \nBut it’s a new year now, and Texas Tech starts spring practice on Saturday. When the Red Raiders are working out this spring, they’ll apparently be missing something: a logo. \nTheir players are banned from wearing the school’s classic “Double T” in the team’s facilities, because coach Kliff Kingsbury’s staff wants them to “earn” it. The ban is to last “until further notice,” so we’re entering a period of immense uncertainty.\nUntil further notice, the Double T is not allowed to be worn inside the football facility.

That’s a big disappointment. Obviously, we weren’t pleased with the way that we played last year, obviously going 5-7. The coaches weren’t pleased. The fans weren’t pleased.”\n\"That's the feeling around here. We're tired of not wearing the Double T & being disappointed about last year.\" #EarnTheDoubleT , Episode 1. pic.twitter.com/zD0DZpZmL4 \n— Texas Tech Football (@TexasTechFB) March 2, 2017 Kingsbury says Texas players have “been through the wringer, really” and are “pissed off.” The ban extends to Tech’s 11 midyear enrollees, who weren’t part of last year’s lousy team but have joined the program for spring ball.\nThe on-hiatus logo looks like this: Wikimedia Commons There are lots of things banning a logo will not fix. Last year, Tech’s defense was a monstrosity, finishing 128th (out of 128) nationally with 43.5 points allowed per game. These things are not quantifiable, but if they were quantifiable, I’m guessing the prohibition on Tech players wearing their team’s own logo would only shave that point total by, say, 0.2 points per game. \nBanning a logo will not bring back star quarterback Patrick Mahomes , who put up humungous numbers last year and is now getting set for the NFL Draft . It will not bring Tech’s recruiting into the top half of the Big 12. It will probably not be something we look back on and are led to think, “That bold, decisive move helped Tech win many more games, saving Kingsbury’s job and leading to a Big 12 title.”\nOr maybe that’s exactly what will happen. College football’s like that. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T04:14:22.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
