Feb 23 Let’s Swing GA-06 Left! We’re adding Georgia’s 6th Congressional District (GA-06) to our target list. We have an immediate opportunity to flip this U.S. House seat , which was left vacant when Republican Tom Price joined the Trump administration. A special election is scheduled for April 18th , with a potential runoff on June 20th. This seat is swingable — Trump won in GA-06 by about 1%, and the vote here has been trending increasingly Democratic in recent elections. You can get involved right now by bringing people together for a House Party the weekend of March 4th . House parties are a great chance to meet other passionate people, get up to speed on Georgia 6, and start taking action together to flip the House. If you’ve never done something like this, don’t worry — our House Party Team has your back. We’ll provide everything you need for a successful party, including: Step-by-step planning guide Suggested agenda and talking points Tools and calendar for planning actions Here’s what else you can do right now: If you live in or near GA-06, join Swing Left Team GA-06 to be kept in the loop about volunteer opportunities. Share this post on social media with #GA06. Half the battle is making sure people know that this special election is happening and that we have an opportunity to win back a U.S. House seat in just a few months! We’ll send along more details soon about this special election and how you can help win it. Let’s get to work!
