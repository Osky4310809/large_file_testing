Smalling crocked United team-mate Jones earlier in the week — now he's hurt too (Photo: Getty) \nMourinho is likely to be unhappy that John Stones and Raheem Sterling of top-four chase rivals Manchester City were rested for the Germany game because of little knocks and the number of games they have played recently. \nSterling and Stones will both come back into the starting line-up against Lithuania on Sunday, with Gareth Southgate set to revert to a back four at Wembley after using a three-man defence in Dortmund. \nSmalling’s injury and Gary Cahill's suspension means Michael Keane of Burnley will keep his place from midweek, partnering Stones in central defence in what is expected to be a 4-1-4-1 formation. England are also without centre-back, and Wednesday's skipper, Cahill because of a ban (Photo: PA Wire) \nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy is likely to be handed the job of leading the attack after shaking off a knock, with United forward Jesse Lingard also set to start. \nMiddlesbrough’s Ben Gibson has been called to the squad to replace Smalling. \nKeeper Joe Hart, who will captain England with Cahill, Wayne Rooney and Jordan Henderson all unavailable, said: “We’re missing a few, but we’ve got a good conveyor belt and some really good options. \n“We’re certainly not having to downgrade in what we do. We just replace and bring someone to the fold and it’s another opportunity for someone to show what they can do at international level.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:37:36.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
