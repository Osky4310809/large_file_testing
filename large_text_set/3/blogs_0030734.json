I suppose that’s an easier pill to swallow than telling someone you’re breaking up with them because, uh, you don’t like them anymore. I’m just saying. \nKris and Corey had been together since 2014, shortly after she split from Caitlyn. \n[ Bossip ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:04:48.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
