Controversial columnist Katie Hopkins (Photo: Getty) \nHopkins posted: \"@MsJackMonroe scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals?\" \nTwitter had erupted after a memorial to the women of the Second World War in Whitehall was daubed with the words \"F*** Tory scum\" during an anti- austerity demonstration. \nMonroe, 28, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, also claims that a second tweet by Hopkins bore a \"defamatory innuendo meaning\" that she \"approved or condoned the criminal vandalisation of the women's war memorial in Whitehall during an anti-government protest\". \nHer lawyer William Bennett told Mr Justice Warby: \"The claimant's primary case is that by reason of the seriousness of the allegations and the scale of publication, serious harm to reputation has been caused. The case resolves around a Twitter spat (Photo: Getty) \n\"A widely published allegation that someone has either vandalised a war memorial or approved of such an act will inevitably cause serious damage to reputation.\" \nMr Bennett said \"the libel was a particular affront to her because part of her identity is as a member of a family closely involved with the armed forces\". \nEven after Hopkins deleted the first tweet, \"she did not apologise or retract the allegation even though she knew it was false\", he said. \nJonathan Price, for Hopkins, told the judge in written argument that her case was that \"this relatively trivial dispute arose and was resolved on Twitter in a period of several hours\". \nHe argued that \"no lasting harm, and certainly no serious harm\", to Monroe's reputation resulted from it. \nMr Price said her case was that \"these proceedings are an unnecessary and disproportionate epilogue to the parties' otherwise forgotten Twitter row\". \nMonroe rejected Mr Price's suggestion that rather than it being the worst thing to happen to her on Twitter, which was her evidence, it was in fact the best thing because it gave her the opportunity to bring the proceedings. \nShe told the court: \"These proceedings have been a nightmare. It has been an 18-month, unproductive, devastating nightmare. \n\"I did not want to be here today. I have offered several times though my lawyer to settle these proceedings outside court. \n\"This is the last thing that I wanted to be doing.\" \nThe case continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:30:37.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
