Egypt’s victory against Burkina Faso a day earlier means the final for AFCON is set. \nThe Indomitable Lions opened the scoring off of a set piece in the second half, but it was the second that really sealed the deal. They did so in delightful fashion. It's done! @FecafootOfficie seal a final spot!

Once they lost possession, Christian Bassogog was off to the races. He caught a perfectly weighted ball and sped past Ghana’s lone man at the back. A cheeky flipped finish past Brimah Razak and Cameroon. Were. Jubilant. \nThe Indomitable Lions have enjoyed plenty of success at AFCON, winning the whole tournament four times, but hadn’t been back in the final since 2008. Now they’ve returned, and they’ll square off against Egypt, who they have plenty of history with. The two have faced off in the final twice, with Egypt winning the last two occasions. \nCameroon will hope that the third time is the charm on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:05:48.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
