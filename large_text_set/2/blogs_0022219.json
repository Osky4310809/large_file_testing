Cuomo has an answer for those who say he’s thin-skinned — check out FDR.\n“They say I’m thin-skinned. I’m calloused compared to FDR,” Cuomo told an audience Thursday at the West Haverstraw Municipal Center in Rockland County.\nFranklin D. Roosevelt served as governor of New York from 1929 until his election as president in 1932.\nCuomo tossed out his name during a speech pushing his plan to consolidate local government services.\n“FDR used to rail about property taxes because he had the same criticism,” he said. “New York State is a high tax state and he was a little bit thin-skinned.”\nCuomo said Roosevelt faced the same tough issues he does — but ducked government consolidation.\n“He did not like criticism for the State of New York,” Cuomo said.\n“So, he would say, ‘It’s not the state tax. It’s the number of local governments that we have in this state that is creating the problem.’ And, when I say it’s a tough problem that has to be tackled, he talked about it, and, frankly, he didn’t tackle it and it’s been a problem since that time. And, that’s the challenge that we’re trying to face,” Cuomo said.\nCuomo insisted that New York’s high property taxes are a result of multiple layers of government – county, local and special districts.\n“Property taxes are not my fault,” he said. “They’re not the mayor’s fault. They’re not [Rockland] County Executive [Ed] Day’s fault. This happened way before us.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:07:52.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
