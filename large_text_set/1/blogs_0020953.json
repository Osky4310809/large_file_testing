(Photo: Isabel Infantes , AFP/Getty Images) \nA British charity that crusades against child abuse asked U.K. government officials on Thursday to close loopholes in the law that currently allows coaches to have sex with players as young as 16. \nYouth sport coaches in England aren’t considered to be in a “position of trust” like teachers and some other professions. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children also advocated a repeal of a law that currently prohibits background checks on assistant coaches, which could allow those barred from contact with children to be in a supervisory role. \nThe push for changes in the law comes amid a scandal where hundreds of former youth players have alleged they were abused by coaches at UK soccer clubs. \n“It makes no sense for the law to potentially give abusers who are barred from working with children, the opportunity to do just that,” NSPCC Chief Executive Peter Wanless said in a statement. “And it is remarkable that the roles like sports coaches are not considered to be a position of trust by law, given the significant amount of responsibility, influence and authority that an individual in this role can hold in a young person's life.” \nThe charity told The Telegraph it has lobbied the Home Office and with the Department for Culture Media and Sport to change the existing laws. \n“The government is completely committed to doing all it can to ensure people can participate in sport in safe and secure environments,\" the U.K. government said in a statement t o The Telegraph . \"In November, we wrote to sports governing bodies to look at their own safeguarding practices to make sure they are as robust as possible and that work is ongoing.” \nUnder laws in most states, coaches are considered to be position of supervision or authority that would push the age of consent – which is low as at 16 in some states – to 18. There is also no federal law that would limit background checks for assistant coaches. \nPHOTOS: 2016-17 English Premier League season Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
