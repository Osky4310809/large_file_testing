While the Champions League trophy has turned into somewhat of an obsession, their coach is pragmatic and realistic. He wants the team to focus on Palermo, not because he's worried about a loss but because his side must have their feet planted firmly on the ground, taking nothing for granted. \nThe Rosanero have proved interesting to watch in recent weeks. They held Napoli to a 1-1 draw, defeated Crotone and only lost to high-flying Atalanta. In Diego Lopez, they have a coach who genuinely believes they will escape relegation and isn't afraid to tinker and adapt. Against Juve on Friday evening, he will reportedly change shapes and play a 3-4-3 formation. \nPlaying in a more organised fashion, Palermo are learning how to frustrate their opponents and would love nothing more than to spring another surprise, much like they managed against Maurizio Sarri's Napoli. \nMired in the relegation zone, their league position proves they aren't the greatest of teams. But Allegri is rightly concerned arrogance will strip his Juve side of that hunger to constantly work, to remain concentrated for the entirety of the match and seal the win. European honours are coveted, but so is a sixth-straight Scudetto . Marko Pjaca has shown superior technical ability for Juventus, but could learn from compatriot Mario Mandzukic's work ethic. \nWith Mario Mandzukic suspended, Allegri is considering changing to the 4-3-1-2 formation, with Miralem Pjanic in the hole behind Gonzalo Higuain and former Palermo player Paulo Dybala. It seems he's not yet convinced of Marko Pjaca's ability to perform in similar fashion to his absent compatriot to continue with the 4-2-3-1 formation. \nPjaca showed some good signs in his debut match as a starter against Crotone, but Allegri continues to note how important it is for the Croatian international to provide more than technical elegance on the ball. Mandzukic who can at times appear technically limited, works so hard for the side that he is now the example to follow. That he recovered more lost balls than any other player in Juve's match against Cagliari is worthy of applause. Watching him run back and forth with Higuain roaming all around to score and create, it's easy to understand what Juventus and Allegri want from their players. \nAllegri has said: \"Pjaca must start understanding that to reach certain levels he needs to start pedalling, because football isn't just about technique, it's about sacrifice and availability. He has great quality, but we're Juve and if you want to become a great player you need the right mindset.\" \nThat means wanting to sacrifice. There are many beautiful players in the world of football, but not all are willing to work hard to earn the trophies. There is a reason why Real Madrid sold Mesut Ozil, an elegant player often criticised for his lack of consistency, and why the biggest clubs in the world are vying for Alexis Sanchez -- one of the few who has learnt to fight relentlessly, making an impact in practically every game he plays. \nPjaca must earn his right to play and that might involve sacrificing his dribbles to win back possession and create space for others to shine. The chances being offered are few and far between so if Pjaca is picked for Palermo, he must work hard to secure future appearances and Allegri's trust. \nnull", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:58:26.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
