These Kentucky fans at a bar in Lexington fall into the latter group. (Metaphorically, anyway.) \nUK fans at the Tin Roof react in the seconds before the game expires. #Limestone #BBN pic.twitter.com/xXwk7YKw15 \n— HLpublicsafety (@HLpublicsafety) March 26, 2017 The person who tweeted that video says it’s a popular place called Tin Roof. However:\nThat’s Two Keys, not Tin Roof, but yeah this is a good summary of every UK fan’s reaction. https://t.co/mDto8vePiG \n— Cam Newton (@morrisoncrying) March 27, 2017 If you want to, go ahead and open up this post in a new window, but keep this page open, and press play on the highlight below.\nSee if you can tell when Malik Monk ties the game for Kentucky with seven seconds left and when Luke Maye wins it for North Carolina shortly thereafter.\n#Elite8 pic.twitter.com/GETD7qN2kG \n— NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) March 26, 2017 Those soundtracks line up pretty well, yeah. \nWatching sporting events with other people is a good thing. You get to share the joy when your team hits an improbable shot to tie a game in the final minute, and you get people to be miserable with if that turns out not to be enough. These Kentucky fans got the full March Madness experience in a span of seven seconds. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:19:19.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
