Thompson / NATIONAL POST Samson, Minister , Nova Scotia Department of Energy, speaks on the subject of LNG in a Competitive Market during the CAPP Scotia Bank Investment Symposium which was held at the Delta Toronto Hotel, Wednesday April 13, 2016. The probe into 11 councillors and the CAO cleared two officials, while eight of them accepted responsibility and one councillor had not signed an agreement.\nThe report found the contributions that were illegally reimbursed had been accepted by the Liberal Electoral District Association for Cape Breton-Richmond, but then returned to the Finance Department.\nChief Electoral Officer Richard Temporale said in a news release that Elections Nova Scotia is also launching an amnesty period for reporting similar breaches of the act in the past.\n“It is unknown how widespread the practice of organizations reimbursing individuals who attend political fundraising events might be,” says the agency.\nRelated Newfoundland and Nova Scotia reach own health-care funding deals with Trudeau government Conservatives blast Trudeau’s ‘obvious ethical missteps’ despite promised fundraising legislation John Ivison: Trudeau’s political dominance wanes as bad news budget looms and electorate tires of bread and circuses The agency says it understands corporations, unions or municipalities often reimburse employees or members for such events on the grounds that their attendance “fosters mutually beneficial community and corporate stewardship.”\nHowever, it says this doesn’t apply to political fundraisers, because the public needs to know who is providing financial contributions and the amounts any individual has contributed in a given year.\nThe donations were singled out in a Grant Thornton forensic audit of municipal spending in Richmond County.\nFormer warden Steve Sampson had suggested in an email to Richmond councillors that they could be reimbursed. Sampson did not re-offer in last fall’s municipal elections, but was fired from his job with the Nova Scotia Liberal caucus on Nov. 1.\nMunicipal Affairs Minister Zach Churchill has said the government is now considering options including spot audits of select municipal units, or appointing a municipal auditor general.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T19:38:57.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
