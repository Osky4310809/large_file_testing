The exec said he was owed 15 percent of Khalifa’s music, tour and merchandise earnings. He disputed Wiz’s claims that the company took advantage of him because he said Rostrum prides itself on creating a family environment for its artists. \nSince leaving Rostrum and dropping Grinberg as his manager in 2014, Wiz’s Taylor Gang signed with Atlantic Records (and may or may not have just signed Lil Uzi Vert ).
