First up, Universal has set the Doctor Dolittle release date for Friday, May 24, 2019. \nRobert Downey Jr. brings a signature new take on a very particular genius in the Untitled Doctor Dolittle Project , a sweeping adventure directed by Academy Award winner Stephen Gaghan. Based on the enduring tales imagined by Hugh Lofting, the epic journey will be produced by Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum under their Roth/Kirschenbaum Films ( Alice in Wonderland , Maleficent ), alongside Susan Downey ( Sherlock Holmes franchise, The Judge ) for Team Downey. Gaghan wrote the most recent draft of the screenplay from an earlier draft by Tom Shepherd. \nMeanwhile, at CinemaCon, Sony announced that Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver will now arrive in theaters on Wednesday, June 28 instead of the previously-scheduled August 11 date. \nWright, whose previous credits include Shaun of the Dead , Hot Fuzz , Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and The World’s End , brought together a cast that includes Ansel Elgort ( The Fault in Our Stars , Divergent ) as Baby, Kevin Spacey ( The Usual Suspects ) as Doc, Jon Hamm ( Mad Men , The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ) as Buddy, Lily James ( Pride and Prejudice and Zombies , Cinderella ) as Deborah, Eiza Gonzalez ( Jem and the Holograms , From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series ) as Darling, Jon Bernthal ( Marvel’s Daredevil , The Walking Dead ) as Griff, and Jamie Foxx ( Django Unchained , The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ) as Bats. \nA talented, young getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack to be the best in the game. When he meets the girl of his dreams (Lily James), Baby sees a chance to ditch his criminal life and make a clean getaway. But after being coerced into working for a crime boss (Kevin Spacey), he must face the music when a doomed heist threatens his life, love and freedom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:23:12.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
