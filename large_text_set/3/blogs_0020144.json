I had so much fun writing it, I thought, \"Well I have to write something about raising a daughter.\" So, I asked her the other day, \"OK, so what do dads need to know about raising a girl? If I were to write to dads, how would I fill them in on meeting the needs of a daughter?\" I also interviewed some of the ladies I work with, and the following is a collaborative effort from a lot of the ladies in my life.\nBut before we dive into \"what a daughter needs from her Dad\", let me start with a few disclaimers. I do not pretend to be any kind of an expert. I am sure you can add a few things to this list. Also, I know that there are plenty of single Moms (and Grandmoms and Aunts) who are doing a heroic job in raising their children. But it is my conviction that a girl needs a father in her life, and I would bet that a godly grandfather, step-father, brother, or uncle can go a long way to filling these needs.\nWith that being said ... \"What does a daughter need from dad?\" She needs at least 5 things:\n1. To know you love her mother.\nAlmost every woman I talked to instantly said this was the first priority. Dads, want to impress upon your daughter the right way she should be treated? Love her mother. Treat your wife with respect, kindness, and generosity. Your daughter is watching how you treat Mom. If you use and abuse her, she will get the impression that men are beasts (the teaching of many modern feminists) or that women are tools (the teaching of hedonists). Model the principles of servant leadership, respect, and sacrifice for your wife.\nBe a gentleman and a humble, strong, and confident leader. Your wife will love it, and your daughter will learn how a man should treat her. Now, some people have told me that if you're going to set the right example, you should never argue with your wife in front of the kids. I disagree, somewhat. I think kids need to see a good example of how adults disagree. They need to see parents argue, without using vulgarity, without getting violent, without acting like spoiled brats. They need to see a father who practices restraint, a calm temper, patience and forbearance, repentance (when necessary), forgiveness, and reconciliation.\nIn contrast to the out-of-control snowflakes of today, your daughter needs to see how a real man handles life when it is disappointing. And it can get mighty disappointing at times.\n6 Lessons on Raising Boys to Become Men\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2017/03/22/5-things-a-daughter-needs-from-her-dad/\nload more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:14:38.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
