The latest celebrity to take on the au naturel armpit style? Paris Jackson. The 18-year-old model took to her Instagram story to proudly show off what two months of growing out her armpit hair looks like and fire back with the perfect response to the hair haters.\n\"I didn't realize that people were going to get so upset over my armpit hair,\" she said in a video. \"I didn't realize that was such an issue. It is so funny. People are really mad. I wish I could post some of the responses. You can just tell how angry and infuriated these people are.\"\nShe continued talking about how proud she was of the small amount of hair she grew in two months. \"I love hair, and sweat, and BO. I fucking love it,\" she added. \"I think it's great. Some people think that it's like super disgusting, especially on girls, but every human body does it. It's natural. Get over it.\"\nRelated:\nDyeing Your Armpits Bright Colors Is Now a Thing\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/lvnGRooOj6iwVBkAD3hs9a53ZI0/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/27/645/n/1922153/b47e0d57f1a9ef75_GettyImages-635182350.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/parisjackson/", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/BHOCcvy-lqhnplAC7aPr1JhV2D4/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/27/668/n/1922153/4ae7bc1a582aae08_paris.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-28T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T03:18:39.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
