That’s because many buyers of electric vehicles, including relatively affordable ones like the Nissan Leaf or the Chevrolet Bolt EV , as well as some buyers of plug-in hybrids, could be losing the tax credit of up to $7500 they currently get under the federal Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Credit . \n-Those who buy an EV or a plug-in hybrid are getting a highly sweetened deal on the technology. The federal government has in recent years ramped up subsidies on electrified powertrain costs, from the battery technology to the charging infrastructure and from their development to sales. It’s on the sales side where the tax credit is a great asset, perhaps most in terms of allowing for affordable (in some cases very affordable) leases.\n-The credit, according to some analysts and industry insiders, also helps level the playing field at a time when electrified powertrains are required by regulation but more expensive to build than conventional vehicles. Even with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and General Motors CEO Mary Barra serving on a presidential advisory forum, it’s likely that neither the latest administration nor Congress are going to be as EV friendly as in the past.\n- How It Works \n-The credit works like this: You must buy an electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid for your own personal use (the credit is factored into a lease on an electric car, so you can benefit without outright purchase, too), and you must place the vehicle in service during the tax year for which you’re claiming the credit. If you’re buying, you need to be prepared to finance the full, pre-credit amount, and you may want to see your tax advisor to time the purchase: There is no income cap to claim the credit, but you’ll need sufficient tax liability for the year.\n-The amount of the credit isn’t necessarily $7500, but it adds up to that much for every electric car on the market. On the plug-in-hybrid side—defined as vehicles that are “propelled to a significant extent by an electric motor”—it only applies to those with battery-pack capacity of at least 4 kWh. The vehicle has to have a gross weight of less than 14,000 pounds. Vehicles are eligible for $2500 for hitting those minimum qualifications, with an additional $417 available for each 1-kWh increase in battery capacity, up to a maximum of $7500.\n-The credit originally was passed with bipartisan support from Congress and was adopted as part of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 , with conditions established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and overseen by Internal Revenue Code section 30D.\n- - “ - “Scale and volume are really important to turn a profit on these vehicles; without the tax credit, it will slow things down.” — Joel Levin, Plug-In America\n- - ” - -If the credit is allowed to continue, it will expire at a different time for each automaker, entering a phase-out period once each automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. By some estimates, including a recent projection , Tesla and GM will get there first, in 2018, with Nissan likely to hit that number in 2019. Car and Driver contacted the IRS for verification, and a spokesperson assured us that while they do keep a running tally they can only provide numbers for the four automakers (Ford, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Tesla) that have properly submitted a release waiver.\n- \n-The conditional phase-out is especially important to allow manufacturers to get to certain economies of scale with plug-in vehicles, said Joel Levin, executive director of the advocacy group Plug-In America. “Scale and volume are really important to turn a profit on these vehicles. Without the tax credit, it will slow things down,” said Levin, who argues that dropping the tax credit could serve a sudden, severe wound in vehicle demand—financially bruising an auto industry that has invested billions of dollars into electrified powertrains to date and continues to do so.\n- At Stake: 250,000 Zero-Tailpipe-Emissions Vehicles \n-“In the coming years, the automotive companies are looking to develop market demand from early adopters to those who are price-sensitive,” explained John Gartner, a research director at Navigant, a consultancy that makes projections regarding the vehicle market and green vehicles. If all federal EV incentives and involvement are removed, Navigant projects, overall demand for plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles could be as much as 20 percent lower by 2025 than if government support for these vehicles were to stay the same.\n-Specifically, if the tax credit is eliminated this year, Gartner estimates that some automakers would reduce the number of EV models from 2021 on, likely the earliest that product-development cycles would reasonably allow abandonment of programs.\n-That adds up to about 250,000 fewer U.S.-market vehicles with a zero-tailpipe-emissions mode between now and 2025. It likely would mean decreased vehicle choice as well.\n-In the short term, abolishing the tax credit would impact states to varying degrees depending on their geography, demographics, charging infrastructure, commuting distances, and general tech-savviness. Here is one noteworthy example: Georgia, which in 2015 saw state legislators vote to eliminate that state’s tax credit of up to $5000 per electric vehicle for individuals and businesses. The tax credit had been such a success that the Leaf was selling at more than 15 times the national average in that state. Since the credit was taken away, sales of electric vehicles in Georgia are at a small fraction of what they were.\n- California Dreaming, or Good for the Nation? \n-Selling electric cars to the mass market has been a rocky road, to say the least. In calendar year 2016, both the Tesla Model S and Model X were the U.S. market’s top-selling electric cars, ahead of the Nissan Leaf, and you’re not likely to win friends with any argument that subsidizing Tesla owners is democratizing EV technology. Another oft-heard gripe is that the credit is primarily a subsidy to California. Up until now many automakers have largely set themselves up for that criticism by not pushing dealerships outside the Golden State to stock plug-in vehicles.\n- \n-The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) doesn’t have an official position on the tax credit, although it has released some guidance on how dealers can build an EV sales base . In 2011, the Obama administration proposed turning that tax credit into a $10,000 point-of-sale rebate , with transparency requirements for dealers and lenders, but that was never seriously revisited by Congress or backed by NADA.\n-Navigant’s Gartner doesn’t see any possibility of a compromise in the present political climate, either. “The [Trump] administration has shown a tendency to act very directly and significantly when addressing regulation and government involvement, so it’s more likely that it would be eliminated rather than replaced,” he said.\n- - “ - “Looking ahead, there’s a widening gap between government fuel-economy targets and sales of energy-efficient vehicles.”\n-— Wade Newton, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers\n- - ” - -Automakers that put an emphasis on affordable plug-in models have generally landed in support of the credit. “These incentives directly influence consumer behavior, and given current market conditions (such as low gas prices), they are still necessary to help build the EV market to greater volumes,” said GM communications manager Laura Toole. “We will work with the new administration on any adjustments that seem appropriate.”\n-Nissan, another automaker that’s been bullish on electric vehicles, also backs the credit. “We support incentives that help encourage further consumer consideration to drive electric cars,” said Tim Gallagher, Nissan’s spokesman for electric vehicles. “While the technology continues to develop at a rapid pace, EVs still require support to ensure continued momentum.”\n- Is It Necessary to Resolve Seeming Conflicts? \n-For the industry as a whole, the encouragement is more nuanced. “Automakers have invested billions of dollars in R&D, to modify assembly plants, and to produce and promote fuel-efficient vehicles, so we are definitely eager to see consumers embrace our fuel-efficient technologies,” said Wade Newton, director of communications at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an advocacy group for the auto industry representing 12 automakers responsible for 77 percent of U.S. passenger-car and light-truck sales. That said, the organization has never taken a position on the credit—as it has against the controversial abbreviated timeline the outgoing EPA took with its midterm review of the federal fuel-economy regulations—and is “technology neutral,” according to Newton.\n-“Looking ahead, there is a widening gap between government fuel-economy targets and sales of energy-efficient vehicles, especially as much steeper federal targets are projected,” added Newton. “Alliance members support a strong fuel-economy program where government targets align with affordable technology and market realities.”\n- \n-The credit does help address some of those market realities. It pushes prices much closer to those of equivalent non-EV, non-hybrid gasoline cars of the same size and function, and—provided you turn a blind eye to the abysmal resale value that has plagued most electric vehicles—they’re significantly lower in ownership costs. It helps automakers recoup some of their costs, too. Although, as some automakers have rather bluntly put it , even with the tax credit, they’re in the red—in some cases, by thousands of dollars per vehicle.\n- - The Tax Man Cometh: These 10 States Charge Extra Fees for Electric Cars - Charging Ahead: What Will It Take for Electric Vehicles to Go Mainstream? - Chevrolet Bolt EV: News, Pricing, Reviews of the 238-Mile Chevy Electric Car - -But does it address the new reality in the White House and in Congress? Plug-In America’s Levin says there’s still a lot of bipartisan support from Capitol Hill, partly because of the energy independence that plug-in vehicles help enable. And there is one very solid appeal, on behalf of the credit, that should speak very directly to the current administration: “Every automaker is investing billions of dollars in these cars, and we think it’s really important for them to be built in the U.S. and that the U.S. take leadership on it,” said Levin. “It meshes with both parties’ interests, including manufacturing in the U.S.”\n-It remains to be seen how those priorities are factored. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that he aims to push Congress to work through comprehensive tax reform by July 29, when the assembly begins its August recess.\n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T18:25:22.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
