Walking up 18, we could have just called it a half and not even bothered,” said McIlroy, who did play the 18th hole and halved his Day 3 match. “It is odd whenever you have nothing to play for. I guess that's both of our faults. We didn't win our matches on the first day.” \nStill, McIlroy said he is pleased with his play heading into the year’s first major in two weeks at Augusta National after starting the season slowly with a rib injury. In three starts since the injury, McIlroy finished tied for seventh at the WGC-Mexico Championship , tied for fourth last week at Bay Hill and was 6 under for 35 holes this week. \n“Every time I've played, I've played well. I did OK in Mexico. I did pretty well at Bay Hill. Had a chance to win,” McIlroy said. “Match play is a funny thing. Speaking to Sergio [Garcia] after the first day, if I had played Sergio I would have beat him 6 and 5 and [Kjeldsen] beat me 2 and 1. It's one of those things.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:59:58.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
