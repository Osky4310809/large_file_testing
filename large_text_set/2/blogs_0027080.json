There are generally no kitchens — an especially difficult hardship for families with children, unable to get a home-cooked meal for weeks, even months, at a time. Cluster housing, consisting of units within private apartment buildings, has also been troubling, for its poor conditions and an inability to provide people with the services they need to move into permanent housing. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Shelter openings have already been delayed by neighborhood opposition, as in Maspeth, Queens, where well-organized residents successfully pressured one hotel owner to abandon a potential deal with the city to convert a hotel into a homeless shelter. Mr. de Blasio will also need the cooperation of nonprofit organizations that shelter the homeless. Many of them are reluctant to buy into the mayor’s latest effort because they have not been paid for past services and are working under outdated contracts. The frustration has led to behind-the-scenes tension, and even refusals by some nonprofit providers to open new shelters.

Many executives of nonprofits had hesitated to publicly criticize the administration because Mr. Banks, formerly the head of the Legal Aid Society , and Mr. de Blasio, formerly public advocate and a city councilman who headed the general welfare committee, were seen as sympathetic to the nonprofits’ concerns. Catherine Trapani, executive director of Homeless Services United , a coalition of about 50 shelter providers, estimated that about a third of existing contracts needed action. Now providers will also be asked to open new stand-alone shelters. But patience has eroded as providers have watched Mr. de Blasio roll out one large-scale plan after another without first taking care of the nuts-and-bolts management of contracts and payments. Many providers are dependent on bridge loans, in lieu of payment, that the city gives them as they await the Office of the City Comptroller to register the contracts and cut a check — a monthslong process. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Almost two years ago, the de Blasio administration blamed the comptroller for a failure to register contracts in a timely manner, which Mr. Banks said delayed improvements to the conditions of shelter system. But the blame for the recent delays lies squarely with the mayor’s administration, which is also in charge of renegotiating contracts that originated in the 1980s and 1990s and now have severely outdated rates, some providers said. \nAdvertisement “The city’s lack of organization and failure to plan often means those on the front lines face financial stress and uncertainty,” Scott Stringer, the city comptroller, said in a statement. “Ultimately, that makes this extraordinary challenge harder to fix.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Banks did not address nonprofits’ concerns about the rates. But he said in a statement that the city had worked “as fast as we can” to reduce a payment backlog. He also said some payments remained outstanding because nonprofits had not made necessary improvements to their shelters. Win, one of the largest nonprofit providers of homeless services in the city, will most likely have to tap into $5 million in reserves this year, a comfort that many smaller organizations cannot afford, said Christine C. Quinn, who has been in discussions about running against Mr. de Blasio in this year’s mayoral election. “We can’t take on more work when, in some cases, we are three fiscal years behind in payments for services rendered,” said Ms. Quinn, Win’s chief executive and a former City Council member who ran against Mr. de Blasio in 2013. “There are smaller groups actually laying people off. These are not providers whining about paperwork.” \nWilliam Neuman contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:43:12.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
