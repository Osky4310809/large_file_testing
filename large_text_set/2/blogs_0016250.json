Ramsay has been on something of a rampage, dishing out cuttingly snarky burns in response to a number of home chef’s submissions. Warning: this is not an appetizing collection of food-related tweets.\nLooks like the inside of my grand dads colostomy bag https://t.co/D9YGdx4Bm1 \n— Gordon Ramsay (@GordonRamsay) February 21, 2017 \nForking disgusting….. and that's just the avocado https://t.co/ZPi119Ex27 \n— Gordon Ramsay (@GordonRamsay) February 20, 2017 \nYour supposed to let them cool down before you eat them Steve https://t.co/1AaqjblwPX \n— Gordon Ramsay (@GordonRamsay) February 20, 2017 \nLook for a new flat mate….. quick https://t.co/fX3yY78EkB \n— Gordon Ramsay (@GordonRamsay) February 20, 2017 \nDid this really start out as a piece of steak ?
