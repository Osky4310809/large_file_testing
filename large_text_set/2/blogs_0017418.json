Actually, it was a small knoll. \nCLEVELAND, Ohio - Ohio State opened a 2013 season with high expectations after an undefeated, probation-bound first year under a coach who was already a legend, Urban Meyer. \nThe Buckeyes opened at The Horseshoe against Buffalo, a team that was hardly the usual Mid-American Conference tomato can. That was because of one player, linebacker Khalil Mack. \nTaylor Decker, the tackle who would become one of the great Buckeyes, couldn't block Mack throughout the game. Ohio State won, 40-20, but the visitors could easily have had two more touchdowns. Mack, hands down, was the best player on the field. \nIt was a good Ohio State team, too, which won 12 straight games in 2013 before losing to Michigan State and Clemson, a practice that is becoming somewhat common in the Meyer years. \nGreat in the NFL too \nFlash forward to Mack's distinguished NFL career in Oakland. Now a defensive end, he has has been to two Pro Bowls, along with earning two first-team All-NFL selections. Mack has registered 27 quarterback sacks in the past two years and was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year last season. \nYet the Raiders had only a slight chance when they took the field in Houston for their first playoff game since they lost the Super Bowl after the 2002 season. After finally finding a quarterback to give the offense proficiency and stability, they lost Derek Carr to injury late in the regular season. \nThe cautionary tale of the Houston Texans \nThe Houston-Oakland game, a 27-14 Texans' victory, was the summit of the pressure-the-passer theory of football success. \nActually, it was more like the small knoll of it since the beleaguered quarterbacks were Oakland's Connor Cook, the one-time Walsh Jesuit and Michigan State quarterback, and Houston's Brock Osweiler, who couldn't beat out what was left of Peyton Manning in Denver. \nIn Jadeveon Clowney, Whitney Mercilus and the injured J.J. Watt, the Texans have had a defense that needs a nickname like Doomsday, or People-Eaters, or Gruesome Threesome. \nYet the Texans are no Super Bowl threats. They were summarily dismissed from the playoffs the next weekend by the New England Patriots, who won it all because they have the greatest quarterback of all time, Tom Brady. \nThomas testifies for the defense \nBrowns tackle Joe Thomas is wary of the Browns taking another quarterback plunge after Johnny Manziel sailed into town in a swan boat. \nThe German knight Lohengrin took a swan ride to rescue a maiden in legend. But Johnny Goofball's dinghy sank, leaving only a trace of truthfulness and sobriety. \nThomas likes Texas A&M's edge rusher, Myles Garrett, with the No. 1 pick. \nOf course, Thomas has spent his whole career on lousy teams because the Browns have never gotten the quarterback thing right. \nThe top quarterbacks available \nThe Browns should take Clemson's Deshaun Watson. Watson didn't run as much as before in his final, national championship season at Clemson. Still, just the thought of a running quarterback brings back Manziel nightmares to many fans. Watson's maturity and discipline, however, are at much higher levels. \nThe other quarterbacks rated highest are North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky, who played high school football at Mentor, and DeShone Kizer of Notre Dame, a Toledo native. \nIf the Browns had even just a solid quarterback in place, Garrett would be a no-brainer at No. 1. \n\"No brainer,\" however, is an apt description of the way the franchise has been run. \nDo the Browns want to go 7-9 or 8-8 as a high-water mark? Or do they want to contend for a championship? \nNothing changes until they resolve the quarterback problem.
