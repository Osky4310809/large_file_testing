She was 19. \nOriginally named Rowdy, she was born in April 1997 at media mogul Ted Turner’s Flying D Ranch in Gallatin Gateway, Mont. As a calf, she suffered life-threatening injuries. \nAccording to her profile on CUBuffs.com: “ She was separated from her mother when she was about a month old and was found in the jaws of a coyote with bite marks around her neck. She survived the attack and was bottle-fed by the ranch hands for four months.” \nTurner donated Rowdy to the school in 1998 where she spent nearly 10 years serving as the CU’s mascot, from 1998-2008. Ralphie V, originally named Blackout, has been CU’s mascot ever since. \n“Losing Rowdy is like losing a family member,” former associate athletic director Gail Pederson said in a news release. “I was there with Johnny Parker when she arrived as a baby at his ranch in 1998, and watched her grow up to be a member of the most respected and revered live mascot programs in the county. I know all Buff fans, and especially the Handlers that had the honor to run with her, will always have her in their hearts, especially when Ralphie V and all the future Ralphies take the field each fall.” \nDuring her tenure, she ran in 75 games — tied for the most among Ralphies with Ralphie I — including six bowl games and four conference championship games. \nRalphie IV was buried in Henderson.
