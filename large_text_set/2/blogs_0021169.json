President Barack Obama was still in office, we had over a month to plan for Valentine’s day still (which we still blew), and Beyoncé announced she would be headlining Coachella 2017! \nWhat a world! What a time to be alive! \nBut on Thursday, we woke up to some sickening news. \nBeyoncé, on doctor’s orders, has pulled out of Coachella . She promises to return next year as a headliner, but God… does this hurt. \nI don’t want to be selfish, but are her twins that much more important than ME?! (The answer is obviously yes to everyone including myself, but excluding my own mother.) \nA statement read, \nFollowing the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months, Beyonce has made the decision to forgo performing at the 2017 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival. However, Goldenvoice and Parkwood are pleased to confirm that she will be a headliner at the 2018 festival.

Who else could rock such iconic fashion? Who else could perform elaborate choreography in ridiculously high heels? Beyoncé rose to fame in a girl band, and the Spice Girls are the ultimate girl band. Yes, I did just realize this line from “2 Become 1” was about condoms. THEY WOULD ADVOCATE SAFE SEX SO NO LITTLE COACHELLA BABIES HAPPEN. Who run the world? Girls. And what is the Spice Girls’ main ideology? \nI say without an ounce of irony the Spice Girls were the first people to teach me about feminism. \nAnd you know who else loves feminism? \nOur girl Bey. \nIf we can’t have Beyoncé, let us have this… \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:54:30.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
