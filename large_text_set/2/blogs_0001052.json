The series brought the Green Arrow to life, and kicked off the entire Arrow-verse that we know today. \nFive years ago, the hype around the show was building, but no one knew exactly what to expect. Come to find out, the show was a massive hit, and it's become a part of our Wednesday night rituals. \nIn honor of Wayback Wednesday - and a brand new episode of Arrow tonight - it's about time to take a look back at the first ever trailer for Arrow . \nThis footage was seen in 2012, and it talked a lot about Oliver Queen's return to the real world, after he was thought to be dead. The trailer shows Oliver on the island, beard and all, as well as his assimilation back into society. \nArrow , The Flash , and all of the other DC TV shows have come a long way since this first trailer, but it's always nice to remember one's roots. \nThe new Arrow episode is titled 'Second Chances', and airs tonight on The CW. \nTALIA AL GHUL TAKES OLIVER UNDER HER WING — In his quest to take down Kovar, Oliver ( Stephen Amell ) gets help from a surprising source – Talia al Ghul (guest star Lexa Doig). However, when she reveals what she wants from him in exchange, Oliver isn’t sure he can accept her help.
