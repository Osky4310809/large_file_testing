READ MORE: Donald Tsang found guilty of corruption \n\"Never in my judicial career have I seen a man fallen from such a height,\" Chan said as he handed down the sentence in a Hong Kong court. \"However, it is not in dispute that the defendant has dedicated himself to public service for the past 40 years.\" \nThe judge said he was going to give Tsang 30 months in jail but took off 10 months because of his good character and contribution to Hong Kong. The maximum penalty for misconduct is seven years. \nTsang showed little emotion as the sentence was read out in a packed courtroom. \nChan noted that among Tsang's major contributions to public service, one that stood out was \"his effort in overcoming\" the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. \nTsang, who was financial secretary at the time, led the city's successful defence of its currency peg against speculators. \nA jury found Tsang guilty last week of one count of misconduct in public office but not guilty on a second count. \nIt's one of several recent cases that have shaken public confidence and raised concerns about cozy ties between Hong Kong's leaders and wealthy tycoons. \nJurors ruled 8-1 that he committed misconduct when he failed to disclose that the penthouse in neighbouring Shenzhen in mainland China was owned by a businessman whose company was applying for a digital radio license. \nThey unanimously cleared him of the second misconduct charge, which alleged he failed to reveal he had nominated for an award an interior designer working on the penthouse's renovations. \nThe jury couldn't decide on a third charge of accepting an advantage. A retrial is tentatively scheduled for September. \nOutside the court, Tsang's wife Selina said that her husband would appeal the verdict. \"Today is a very dark day,\" she told reporters. \"My family and I are very disappointed and sad at the court's decision today. \"Donald and I have been greatly troubled and felt immense pressure in the past five years. So we are very sad about today's outcome. But we will face it with strength and courage. We will appeal.\" Source: News agencies Tell us what you think    ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:22:34.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
