This concept enables us to engage with luxury customers and gather feedback on our approach.\" \n\"Bentley is committed to offering an electric model in its future portfolio and we are interested to receive feedback on this concept,\" Dürheimer concluded. \nThe Luxury of Electric: Effortless, Exclusive and Exhilarating \nAn all-electric Bentley will not compromise the quality, refinement and high performance levels expected of the luxury brand. These renowned Bentley characteristics such as immediate, effortless surge of torque and grand touring range will be combined with new high performance technology such as rapid inductive charging and state-of-the-art on board concierge-style services for an effortless ownership experience. \nBentley's vision is for customers to benefit from high-speed inductive charging and provide a range sufficient for grand touring requirements. An electric Bentley would, for example, be able to drive between London and Paris or Milan and Monaco on a single charge and the on board experience will be enhanced for both driver and passenger thanks to the integration of state-of-the-art technology. 2017 Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e Concept \nA fusion of cutting-edge technology and beautiful materials is evident right throughout EXP 12 Speed 6e's luxuriously appointed cabin, ensuring that the brand's use of technology is not cold or emotionless. The entire central console, for example, is hewn from a solid piece of elegantly curved glass encompassing a high-definition OLED screen. All of the car's principle onboard controls are accessible from here, including navigation, entertainment and climate control. \nHandmade, cut-glass sections on the steering wheel contain the controls for media, communications, navigation and car set-up. There are also two buttons featured at the top of the cut-away steering wheel, one offering an instant performance boost and the other the ability to limit speed, in urban areas for example. \nThe passenger, meanwhile, has their own control panel on the front fascia with access to social media, email and entertainment. \nExquisite copper elements around the gear selector, Bentley Dynamic Drive dial and in the door veneer panels are integrated into the cabin to highlight the electric performance potential of the concept's advanced new powertrain. \nThe car's intelligent infotainment system is the central brain to access many real world services using connected-car Apps. \nDesigning the Future of Luxury \nOn the outside, the iconic Bentley mesh grille features a complex 3D geometry and smoked finish with copper highlights that identify the Bentley EXP 12 Speed 6e as a fully electric vehicle. When the car is running the '6e' logo illuminates in a striking, vibrant white. \nThe exterior design is an expression of muscular, athletic surfaces inspired by contemporary architecture, the natural world and the aerodynamic shapes of aircraft fuselages. \nIt represents a natural evolution of Bentley's design DNA and signifies future design direction, taking the famous powerline and haunch to new levels of drama and tension. When combined with muscular proportions and an athletic stance through the use of a short front overhang, long bonnet, low grille and wide rear, the exterior styling hints at the high-performance potential of the car. \nThe twin bonnet scoops act as highly effective heat sinks that supply additional cooling to the battery and powertrain. \nThe wing mirrors - which are cameras rather than traditional reflective glass - are exceptionally sleek and were inspired by the sculptural form of stealth aircraft fuselages. \nWhen rapid inductive charging is not available, EXP 12 Speed 6e can be connected to a mains AC power supply via the auxiliary charging point, subtly concealed behind the rear number plate. \nA Commitment to an Electric Future \nBentley believes that the concept will open discussions with luxury car buyers of the future - millennials, members of Generation C and the rising affluent in developing economies - to understand the desired expectations from a future electric luxury car ownership experience. \nThe luxury brand's electric car strategy includes the introduction of PHEV models across the Bentley model range over the next few years, starting with the Bentayga in 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:10:53.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
