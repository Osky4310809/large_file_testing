Netanyahu’s visit comes amid tensions between UK and EU over Israel Read more \n“I would expect the prime minister to set out the government’s position that we think the continued increase in settlement activity undermines trust,” No 10 spokesperson told reporters last week. \nNetanyahu is seeing May and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as part of a series of visits in which he will travel to Australia, to meet the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Washington, where he will meet Donald Trump. \n“We are at the start of a significant diplomatic period for the State of Israel ,” Netanyahu said on Sunday. \n“In the diplomatic sphere, I intend to emphasise the need for a common front against Iran’s defiant aggression which has raised its head in recent days. This must be done on an ongoing basis, but especially in light of Iran’s defiance against the international order.” \nThe Israeli leader has also made clear he intends to raise the issue of cooperation over cybersecurity when he meets both May and Trump. \nNetanyahu’s visit to Downing Street comes amid growing international divisions over the Israel-Palestine peace process, not least since Trump’s inauguration, which Israel hopes to exploit. \nAt a recent conference in London, David Bitan, an Israeli MP and chairman of Netanyahu’s rightwing Likud party, laid out what he suggested were Israel’s aims. \n“Netanyahu will try to take advantage of the situation in Europe in order to create a system of support for Israel, which will lean upon the largest countries on the continent, including Britain, France, Italy and Germany,” he told Jewish leaders. \nThe renewed Israeli focus on Iran comes after a convergence of views between Washington and Tel Aviv since Trump’s inauguration on the question of Tehran and the nuclear deal, which Netanyahu hopes to capitalise on. \nAn Iranian ballistic missile test last weekend drew a quick round of new US sanctions against Iran, while Trump warned Tehran it was “playing with fire”. \nSpeaking in the immediate aftermath of the missile test, Netanyahu: “I will be meeting with President Trump in Washington soon and among other things I intend to raise with him the need to renew sanctions against Iran – sanctions against ballistic missiles and additional sanctions against terror, as well as dealing with this whole weak nuclear agreement. \n“I know this agreement bothers not only Israel and not only the United States but many other countries in the region as well and we will move this ahead because Iran’s aggression must not go unanswered.” \nIran, and more recently its 2015 nuclear deal with the international community, has long obsessed Netanyahu and drove his ill-judged visit to address the US Congress against the wishes of the Obama administration, fuelling tensions between the two men. \nAlthough other issues have got more prominence since Trump’s inauguration – including the controversial discussion of whether to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and a surge in Israeli settlement building announcements – Iran has emerged again as a key Israeli diplomatic issue. \nAfter eight years of the Obama administration, which pushed back against Netanyahu’s concerns about Iran, the Israeli prime minister now believes he has a far more sympathetic audience in the shape of the convergence of May, Trump and Turnbull. \nIsraeli officials see opportunities for a closer relationship with a UK apparently determined to leave the EU and which will have to restructure its international relationships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T19:02:21.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
