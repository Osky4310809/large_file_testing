Millions of hours \nThe Â£1.35bn link will replace the Forth Road Bridge as the main road route between Edinburgh and Fife. \nMr Brown gave the an update to the Scottish Parliament's rural economy and connectivity (REC) committee earlier. \nThe final section of the deck was lifted into place last month. \nThe contractor has reported there have been fewer clear weather windows than expected, particularly in relation to wind. Analysis by Marc Ellison \nPlanning a walking trip - let alone the construction of a bridge - is always challenging given Scotland's notoriously fickle weather, which can be glorious one moment, tempestuous the next. \nSo it's no surprise to see the extent to which winds have battered the Queensferry Crossing over the last few years. \nData obtained by the BBC from Transport Scotland reveals gusts between 30 and 127 miles per hour were recorded between September 2012 and May 2016. \nA separate document indicated the safe working limits on the deck lifts and cabling were 25 and 28 miles per hour respectively. \nAnd the data also shows certain months of the year are historically worse than others. \nIn an average December during this period, gusts of over 30 miles per hour were recorded by anemometers on 22 days; 18 days in your standard January, and 14 and 15 in a typical February and March. \nThe data also reveals that, on average, gusts of wind over 30 miles per hour were recorded for 40% of the days in 2013, 2014, and 2015. \nThe contractor, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, anticipated an average weather-related downtime of 20%. \nMr Brown said: \"Today there are only nine weeks remaining to the end of May and the review has concluded that even with the best weather this date is not now safely achievable. \n\"I fully recognise the effort of the workforce in building this amazing new bridge. Over 13 million hours have gone into building the Queensferry Crossing over the past six years. \n\"There is no additional cost to the public purse and the Forth Road Bridge continues to carry traffic over the Forth during these final weeks of construction. \n\"While its clearly very disappointing the new bridge won't be ready ahead of the contractual completion date, I believe it is important to take the time to make sure the bridge is built in the safest possible circumstances to the highest possible standards.\" Queensferry Crossing - fact and figures \nThe structure is 207m above high tide (683ft), equivalent to about 48 double decker buses stacked on top of each other. \nIt is 50m (25%) higher than existing Forth Road Bridge \nThe steel required for the bridge deck weighs a total of 35,000 tonnes -equivalent to almost 200 Boeing 747s \nThe combined steel required for North and South viaducts weighs 7,000 tonnes - enough to make another 23 Kelpies. \nThe bridge has windshielding to almost entirely eliminate the need for closures during the frequent periods of high winds in the Forth estuary \nCables can be replaced with more ease than on the Forth Road Bridge - it can be done as part of normal maintenance works without closing the bridge. \nSally Cox, chairwoman of the board for the Forth Road Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC) said: \"FCBC acknowledge that the uniqueness of this project and the onerous weather conditions it has experienced, particularly working at height crossing the Forth have created more challenges than we anticipated. \n\"FCBC have always been and remain ambitious about completing this challenging project at the earliest possible date and share Transport Scotland and the public's frustration over this delay. \n\"We have assured Transport Scotland that every endeavour is and will continue to be made, to safely complete the project at the earliest opportunity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:32:17.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
