Through it all, passengers said, they were frustrated every step of the way by the dearth of information about whether they were safe, where to go once the airport was shut down and how they could retrieve the thousands of items — 23,000 according to a tally by airport officials — that were scattered across terminals. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story For the thousands who fled the terminals, seeking refuge on the tarmac or hiding wherever they could, food and water quickly became scarce. Bathrooms were nonexistent. Passengers on some planes that were either preparing to take off or trying to reach a gate were stuck on board for up to seven hours. Passengers said that some level of pandemonium is to be expected after a shooting, and they praised law enforcement for the swift response. But it was the aftermath of the rumor, which was debunked relatively quickly, that left them bewildered and angry. Photo People exited the airport perimeter following a shooting at baggage claim.

It was a voluminous undertaking and we did it, as horrific and horrible as this scene was.” Up until that point, he said, the plan was by the book. “Had the misinformation of the active shooter not surfaced,” he said, “we would have had buses to the airport within 30 minutes.” Sheriff Israel said he could not remember how long it took to confirm there was no second gunman. The authorities debunked the rumor about 30 to 45 minutes after it had started to spread, raising questions about whether the airport could have just been reopened right away. By then, law enforcement was already sweeping the airport and garages. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It is still unclear how the rumor began. Several passengers said in interviews that they heard what they believed to be gunshots in Terminal 3, something that sounded like loud pops. Sheriff Israel said that he was told somebody saw a bloody person and assumed a second gunman was loose. Providing accurate information to passengers, airport and airline staff also proved challenging. Law enforcement has access to wireless emergency alerts — the system that sends Amber Alerts — but alerts were not used to inform people that the danger had passed or instruct them on what to do next. Some airports have internal communication systems for employees to send important messages. It is unknown whether this was in place at the Fort Lauderdale airport. Instead, news, accurate and otherwise, traveled through word of mouth or was gleaned from cellphones. “Airports can put out messages to employees, and that is important because passengers will tend to follow directions from uniformed employees in the know,” said Douglas Mansel, the aviation security manager at Oakland International Airport. All airports have emergency plans approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, including for active shooter scenarios. The Fort Lauderdale airport’s director, Mark E. Gale, was not available to comment on airport protocols or on how events unfolded on Friday.

With so many people spread out across different areas, including on the tarmac and in garages, it was hard to get information out. “I tried to tell as many people verbally,” he said. “Communication is critical, but there is no way to communicate to thousands.” Anne Buongiorno, 56, who was visiting from Canada, had to evacuate Terminal 2 twice. The first time, after the shooting, she and her 15-year-old daughter jumped under a seat, their hands over their heads. Her husband was in the bathroom. Terrified, they followed a surge of people down a staircase, but people were shoving one another. She fell down and broke her rib. She and her daughter ended up on the tarmac and were told to lie on the ground near a luggage truck. A while later, they were told to go back inside. A similar scenario played out all over again as the report spread of the possible second gunman. Ms. Buongiorno said she wound up among thousands of people on the tarmac again. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Clusters of people ran back and forth, fleeing what they feared was a threat as the rumor took hold again. Ms. Buongiorno hid behind a truck and waited nearly for five hours, before being led to a hangar and later put on a bus for the cruise port. Nobody gave her information about where to go so she found a hotel on her iPad, got in a long line for a cab and went there. The next day, she was back at the airport waiting for word about how to get her belongings and fly back to Canada. “It was the first time in my life I was so afraid,” she said, her voice quavering at the memory. “I’m afraid still. When I heard somebody talk over there, I’m afraid.” Others joined the long line of people who were told to walk out of the airport along a set of railroad tracks, which skirted a marshy area. A few who had tried to avoid the mayhem by jumping a fence were confronted by law enforcement officers with pointed guns. Those who had luggage dragged it along. Officers sometimes issued contradictory orders, directing people to one location, only to be told by officers there to go back where they came from. Along the way, law enforcement personnel ordered people to raise their arms and sometimes frisked them as they filed by — a common precaution, security experts said, but one that alarmed some. “They were patting us down like there was another shooter,” said Melody Dorward, 22, of Ohio, who walked the railroad tracks. “I felt traumatized. Not safe.” \nNeil Reisner contributed reporting from Fort Lauderdale. Susan Beachy contributed research.
