That would have never have happened. \n“The Government does have a mandate to carry out Brexit, I will support that, but they do not have a mandate for hard-Brexit.” \nMrs May has reiterated that she will exit Britain from the single market and attempt to agree a trade deal with the EU during the two-year Brexit process. \nThe decision from the UK to leave the European block upset the President of the European Commission who described Brexit as a “tragedy”.
