AP/Aaron Favila \n  Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle yesterday called on Filipinos to look for reasons that would unite them as a nation. \nThis was his message for this year’s Feast of the Black Nazarene, a 411-year-old image of a genuflecting Christ with a cross believed by millions to be miraculous. \nIn his homily delivered in front of thousands of devotees of the Black Nazarene at the Quirino Grandstand, Tagle discussed this year’s theme centering on love and national unity. \nTagle said there are two traits of love that call on people to look for factors that unite them. First is the ability of Filipinos to treat other people like family members. Old priest gets dizzy \nWhile Tagle was delivering his homily, a 70-year-old priest got dizzy and was rushed to hospital. \nAccording to Nancy Hasareno, a nurse from the Manila Health Department, Fr. Tony Ropasa of the Diocese of Caloocan “was recorded to have a high blood pressure of 180/80” when he was brought to the medical emergency tent beside the stage of the Quirino Grandstand.   \n“He had difficulty breathing” so it was decided to take him to the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Pasay City, she added. \nRopasa was conscious and was able to talk to medical personnel.
