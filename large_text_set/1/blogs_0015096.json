Lot’s been said (or is being said, as you read this) about the inescapable impact of wearing good shoes. You’d agree that an outfit doesn’t feel like one till your feet slip into a pair that’s worth the dough. So, no arguments here! It’s time for a season update, and what better place to peek into for inspiration than Bollywood. Before it’s spring (and you pack away a third of your favourite shoes), let’s look at what kicks on the feet of our homegirls 1.Thigh-High Mules \nThe thigh-high boots-meets-mules gets a definite nod of approval from Maliaka Arora Khan. The hot mom pairs her hybrid footwear with leather pants, and the classic sweater-over-shirt combo. Get this pair if freezing your toes off is no biggie (or if you live in Bombay).

Tamannah shows how the metallic pair can emerge as the real MVP of any outfit.

But too much of a kind is bad for your sartorial palette. Out with the white, and in with the many colours that beautiful sneaker offers. Like this Tumblr-pink sported by Parineeti Chopra, here, with her cute denim shirt.

Kalki’s pussy-bow Gucci dress gets the best companion in these back-to-school shoes. Pick a pair in black or white to keep things fashionably nostalgic.

The suede ankle-high boots are posing as a strong contender for comfort footwear, specially the low-heeled ones. Shilpa Shetty chooses the footwear for her jetseetting shenanigans.
