Hayden has worked extensively in states that favor Trump, most recently in Missouri for Jason Kander, a national upstart who narrowly lost a race last year for U.S. Senate, as well as for the state’s sitting senator, Claire McCaskill, and the former U.S. senator from North Carolina, Kay Hagan.\nEarlier this year, the group also hired Corey Ciorciari, formerly of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, as the war room’s policy and research director, filling out a still growing team that now comprises about 20 of CAP’s 340 or so employees.\nMost of Trump’s top cabinet nominees have been approved — and will continue to be, given the Republican majority in the Senate. But Jentleson, who last served as a senior aide to former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said CAP will keep casting scrutiny on the president’s lower rungs of government appointees.\n“Those are the people who are going to be actually writing and implementing the policy,” Jentleson said. “It’s a tremendous number of people. For them to be at all feasible, the vast, vast majority of them have to pass by unanimous consent, so all it takes is one objection to slow them down.”\nTrump has already faced what some call a historic delay in his confirmation push. The CAP strategy could help detain Republicans even longer, holding major legislative priorities in limbo. “Floor time is a finite resources,” Jentleson said.\nOriginally founded as a progressive think tank in 2003, CAP officials have also sought to use the “institutional knowledge” of the organization’s large cadre of policy experts to produce what Jentleson called “razor sharp policy analysis that impacts the debate and that really helps drive and sustain grassroots energy,” citing two recent studies on Wall Street gains and middle-class losses under Trump.\nThe anti-Trump focus marks something of a readjustment for an organization that has spent most of its existence under the two-term presidency of Barack Obama, and comes at a time when what unifies the Democratic Party most is opposition to the president, rather than singular policy aims or a shared economic message.\nBut the shift is also a return to CAP’s roots. The think tank and political group was formed opposite George W. Bush, and amid the liberal activism of the 2000s. “It thrives in the opposition,” said Jentleson, who has worked at CAP twice before.\nDuring the Bush years, CAP put together a policy blueprint, Strategic Redeployment 2.0 , for Democrats who opposed the war in Iraq war but wanted a strong military posture. Jentleson said the CAP war room will now look to do the same with a new “economic narrative,” attempting to reframe progressive policy into a message that will be as salient on the left as for “moderates, Independents, and soft Democrats.”\nThe promise to play a key role across the party’s opposition effort — from research to protests and policy — is a tall order for CAP’s war room, still in the process of hiring researchers and a press team under Hayden. (“I hate to use ‘building an airplane as we fly it,’ because it’s a cliche,” Jentleson said. “But it’s really true.”)\nThe month before the inauguration, the group emerged as one of several entities hoping to help lead the anti-Trump efforts Democrats refer to as “the resistance.”\n\nOthers include the former Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA, and the constellation of liberal groups headed by operative David Brock, including American Bridge, which has launched its own opposition research-based war room alongside CAP’s.\nApart from the Washington-based organizations working directly with Senate leaders, a number of activist-based groups have sprung up, leading weekly protests and spear-heading a more aggressive movement to pressure Democrats to take a harder line on Trump — even threatening incumbents with primary challengers.\nBut Jentleson said most of the groups are working together so far. Many are led by strategists who worked with one another for years in Washington, he said, ticking off names like Bradley Beychock at Brock’s groups and Brian Fallon at Priorities, who used to sit next to Jentleson every day when they both worked in the Senate.\n“I have not yet run into an instance where there were too many cooks in the kitchen,” Jentleson said. “It’s people who have very long relationships. You haven’t seen any backbiting.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:05:21.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
