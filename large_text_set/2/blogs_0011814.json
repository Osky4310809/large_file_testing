Why was there not enough security to stop cars and bikes from passing by?\" READ MORE: Quetta lawyers attack - 'Irreparable blow to future' \nSeven police officers and six civilians were killed in the blast claimed by the Pakistani Taliban faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. A spokesman for the group warned in a statement that Monday's bomb was \"just the start\". \nThe attacks underlines the challenges faced by Pakistan in its effort to eliminate armed groups and improve security in the country. \n\"The attacker was not targeting the civilians, he went directly towards the police officials who were negotiating with the protesters,\" Ashad Dogar, a crime reporter for local station The News Channel, who was present at the time of the attack, told Al Jazeera. \n\"In a situation like this where there are about 2,000 people gathered together, the security measures were close to zero,\" Dogar said. \n\"No one was being checked. Anyone could come and participate in the rally. The suicide attacker walked in without any hurdles and successfully conducted the attack.\" READ MORE: Pakistan's new army chief takes command \nPunjab's government declared one day of mourning with the national flag lowered to half-mast at all government buildings. Most of the m arkets and businesses were closed across much of the province and lawyers boycotted court proceedings in the provincial capital. \nLahore residents are \"furious\" at the armed groups conducting attacks, Rehman said, adding that \"people here feel the attacks will increase in the near future\". \n\"If this suicide bomber could conduct an attack this easily, it tell us that we are not safe or protected.\" \nLahore suffered one of Pakistan's deadliest attacks in 2016 when a suicide attack claimed by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar group in a park killed more than 70 people, including many children. \nJamaat-ul-Ahrar also claimed responsibility for a bombing at a hospital in Quetta that killed 74 people in August last year. \nFollow @Shereenaqazi on Twitter Tell us what you think  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:31:46.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
