Nowitzki had seven during the run. \nThe Mavericks led 67-33 at the half and never looked back. \nLou Williams led the Lakers with 15. \nThe Mavericks both scored the most points and allowed the fewest in a half and a game this season. The 34-point halftime lead was the third-largest in franchise history. \nThe Lakers scored their fewest points in a quarter, a first half and a game. \nAll 11 Mavericks who played in the first half scored and had at least one rebound. \nDallas’ Seth Curry scored 14 points, including seven straight in the first quarter for a 13-6 lead. \nThe Lakers showed signs of life on a 10-5 run for a 16-15 lead with 5:50 left in the quarter. Julius Randle scored four of the points, and Luol Deng and Nick Young each hit a 3-point shot. \nThe game was tied 20-20 before Devin Harris made a 3-point shot with 2:46 remaining for a lead that Dallas never lost. \nWesley Matthews and Deron Williams also had 13 points. Harris and Pierre Jackson scored 10 each. Rookies Jackson and Nicolas Brussino (eight points) each reached career highs. \nTIP-INS \nLakers: They played without D’Angelo Russell, second on the team at 14.3 points per game. An MRI taken Saturday showed a mildly sprained right MCL and strained right calf. \nMavericks: J.J. Barea missed his 26th game this season because of a strained left calf. Coach Rick Carlisle said he didn’t expect Barea back until after the All-Star break (Feb. 24 at the earliest). Andrew Bogut (strained right hamstring) could return this week, but would need a day of practice, according to Carlisle. \nUP NEXT \nLakers: Travel to Portland for the second game of a three-game trip on Wednesday. \nMavericks: Complete a three-game homestand on Wednesday against New York. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:12:47.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
