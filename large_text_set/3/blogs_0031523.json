Your email password is probably something different than your Apple ID password, unless you used the same password for both accounts, which you shouldn't have (but some people do). If you just can't remember your Apple ID password, but you do remember your email password, request a password reset from Apple and you'll be good to go.\nBecause your Apple ID is an email address, you'll need access to that email address for the purposes of verifying the change. Make sure you know your password for the email address you want to change your Apple ID to before you make any changes.\nWhen you create an Apple ID, Apple also creates an @iCloud email address for you. This email address is linked to that Apple ID and can't be unlinked or used as the new email address associated with your Apple ID.\nApple suggests that you sign your Apple ID out of all of your devices before changing your email address.

If you find yourself coming across issues trying to set a new Apple ID email address, read on.\n\nWhat to do if your email address is already being used with an Apple ID If you see a warning that the email address you are trying to change to is already being used, then it's already being used. Even if you don't remember creating an account with it, even if you didn't actually create it yourself, it's already being used. Come to terms with that fact and let's fix it.\nYou'll need access to three email accounts for this process.\nThe email account associated with your active Apple ID. The email account associated with the Apple ID you want to change your active Apple ID to (you don't need to know any Apple ID password, but you will need to know the email password). A third email account that can be used as a throw-away email (one that has not already been used as an Apple ID). You can create one before starting, or use an older email address that you don't use anymore (but know the password for). \nStep one: Get the password for the Apple ID associated with the email you want to change to In order to get rid of the Apple ID that's currently bogarting the email address you want to use, you'll have to be able to access it. You can ask Apple to reset the password for the Apple ID associated with it.\nNavigate to iforgot.apple.com from any web browser. Enter the email address you want to switch your active Apple account to (the one you can't currently change because it's already being used). Type in the CAPTCHA characters to prove you aren't a robot. Click or tap Continue .\n\nSelect I need to reset my password . Click or tap Continue .\n\nSelect Get an email . Click or tap Continue .\n\nOpen the email you receive from Apple. Click or tap Reset now . Enter a new password . Reenter the new password . Click or tap Reset Password .\n\nNow you know the password for the Apple ID that you don't remember creating and don't want to use anyway, so you can access it to make changes to it.\nStep two: Change the email associated with the inactive Apple ID Everything you did in Step 1 was so you can dis-associate that email address from the inactive Apple ID. Now that you have access to it, you can change the email address associated with it to something you don't care about. This is where you can use an old email address or a brand new one that you've just created for the sole purposes of using it for the inactive Apple ID.\nFollow the steps for changing the email address associated with your Apple ID and use the Apple ID email address and password from Step 1 above. Change the email associated with that account to the throw-away email address.\nStep three: Go back and change your active Apple ID email Now that the email address you want to use for your active Apple ID is freed up, you can make the changes. Follow the steps for changing the email address associated with your Apple ID . This time, when you enter the new email address , you'll actually be able to use the one you want.\n\nWhat to do if you don't see the option to change your email address If the email address associated with your Apple ID is an @me.com, @Mac.com, or @icloud.com address, you can't change your Apple ID. You won't even be able to see the option to change the email address. There is nothing you can do about this.\nThe only option you have is to start over with a brand new Apple ID using your preferred email address. Unfortunately, this means losing all the content you have associated with your current Apple ID.\nIf you are able to log in to the Apple ID that uses an @me.com, @Mac.com, or @icloud.com email address, you might think about downloading as much content as possible onto your devices or into another cloud-based service ( like photos, contacts, iCloud Drive documents, content not purchased on iTunes, etc.), and then starting over from scratch with your preferred email account.\nBe warned: If you do that, you'll lose all of your iTunes purchases, including movies, music, iBooks, and apps across all of your devices. So, make sure it's worth the loss.\nSee how to download Photos onto your iPhone \nSee how to transfer contacts, calendars, and reminders to your iPhone or iPad by logging out of iCloud \nSee how to create a new Apple ID on your iPhone or iPad \n\nWhat to do if you entered the wrong email address when you created an Apple ID If you accidentally used the incorrect email address to create an Apple ID (for example, you used .com instead of .net), you can fix the mistake simply by changing the email address associated with your Apple ID.\nFollow the steps for changing the email address associated with your Apple ID but use the incorrect email address to sign in.
