(Image from video) \nHere are the full remarks Education Secretary Betsy DeVos delivered Thursday at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, as provided by the Education Department: \n\nHello! Thank you for that warm welcome. I always love the energy and enthusiasm CPAC brings together every year. \nI’m Betsy DeVos. You may have heard some of the “wonderful” things the mainstream media has called me lately. I, however, pride myself on being called a mother, a grandmother, a life partner, and perhaps the first person to tell Bernie Sanders to his face that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. \nThe media has had its fun with me, and that’s OK. \nMy job isn’t to win a popularity contest with the media or the education establishment here in Washington. My job as Secretary of Education is to make education work for students. \nBut today, we know the system is failing too many kids. \nWhy? \nBecause our nation’s test scores have flatlined. \nBecause 1.3 million children drop out of school every year. \nBecause the previous administration spent seven billion of your dollars on “School Improvement Grants,” thinking they could demonstrate that money alone would solve the problem. Yet their own report, issued as they walked out the door, showed that it had zero impact on student outcomes and performance. \nThey tested their model, and it failed … miserably. \nThis is not an indictment of teachers. We all know good public school teachers. My mom was one. Good teachers make a real difference. Good teachers deserve to be honored and compensated accordingly. \nBut the education establishment has   generation. \nThis not a Left or Right issue. This is an American issue. We need education to work for every child. \nLet me ask you: Do you believe parents should be able to choose the best school for their child regardless of their ZIP code or family income? \n(YES!) Me too. And so does President Trump. \nWe have a unique window of opportunity to make school choice a reality for millions of families. Both the President and I believe that providing an equal opportunity for a quality education is an imperative that all students deserve. \nNow let me ask you: How many of you are college students? \n  say, and   \nAs Secretary, I don’t think the Department of Education in Washington should have more power over your decisions than you do. I took this job because I want to return power in education back to where it belongs: with parents, communities, and states. \nWe can do this, but only with your help. \n  ok   \nTogether, we can make American education great again. The next generation deserves no less. \nI thank you, and I look forward to fighting alongside you. local", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:32:07.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
