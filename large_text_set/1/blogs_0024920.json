Ian Holloway described Goss as \"a player with great potential\" (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \n\"I want to put my stamp and my name and the wonderful name of QPR on him - because I firmly believe he's got a fantastic future ahead of him.\" \nGoss added: \"I'm delighted that the deal is done - absolutely buzzing. \n\"I'm at the point now in my career where I need to be playing first-team football, week in, week out - so the opportunity to move to QPR was just something I had to pursue. The 21-year-old never made a senior appearance for United (Photo: Matthew Peters) \n\"Ian (Holloway) and Les (Ferdinand) had a massive influence on me. They told me everything I wanted to hear. \n\"The way they both spoke about QPR, showing such passion for the football club, was really special. \n\"Now it's up to me to repay them both and everyone else at QPR for showing their faith in me.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T21:38:25.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
