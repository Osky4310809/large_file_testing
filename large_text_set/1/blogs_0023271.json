Jeremy Kyle. \nThe TV host famed for grilling people over romantic entanglements has fallen for his children’s former nanny. \nJeremy, 51, and 35-year-old Vicky Burton have been an item for two months, a source has revealed. \nThey first met when she became the family nanny many years ago. \nShe was pictured alongside Jeremy, his wife Carla Germaine and two of their three kids on holiday in Barbados in July 2013. \nJeremy and Carla later split and divorced last February – and the romance with Vicky is his first since the 13-year marriage ended. (Photo: Splash News) \nA pal close to the star said last night: “It’s very early days but he’s very happy. \n“The relationship is just starting out so who knows what the future will hold? \n“Vicky is much loved by all the family. Jeremy’s children have been at the forefront of his mind. He has dealt with his new romance very sensitively. \n“His children have been made aware. He has also told Carla. There’s no animosity. He’s been single for a long time and deserves a bit of happiness.” \nVicky had worked for the family since the children – now aged 13, 10 and seven – were very young. \nShe left the job nine months ago to pursue other work. \nNews of the romance will fascinate viewers of The Kyle Show in which Jeremy addresses relationship dilemmas in front of the camera. \nHe has helped hundreds of warring partners face up to their problems since the ITV show launched a decade ago.

Then suddenly we began kissing. Without talking, I took her hand and led her inside my house. \n“Carla took her high heels off so her shoes wouldn’t make a noise on our stone stairs. We didn’t want to wake my housemates. We started having sex — it was amazing.” \nHe said she was concerned to keep the affair a secret but rumours about it quickly spread like wildfire.

She cited Jeremy’s “unreasonable behaviour” in her divorce petition. \nA month later, in January 2016, Jeremy attended the National Television Awards and spoke about life as a singleton. \nHe said finding new love wasn’t on the agenda so soon after his marriage breakdown. \nHe said: “Kids and work – that’s it. I promise you. Literally that. I’ve thrown myself into work, that has kept me going. I appreciate all the support.” \nHe also laughed off suggestions he could find love on online dating sites like Tinder. \nHe said: “I don’t understand any of that. I’m not on Twitter or any of that rubbish. I’m an old man.” \nLast February the couple were granted a quickie divorce during a hearing at the Central Family Court in High Holborn, Central London. Neither were present. \nJeremy and Carla were married in 2002.They met when she entered a competition called Two Strangers And A Wedding run by BRMB radio station in Birmingham, where Kyle was working. \nAs the winner, her prize was to marry a selected groom, called Greg Cordell. \nBut their marriage lasted just three months amid rumours Greg had had an affair – though he protested his innocence. \nCarla started dating Jeremy afterwards. \nThe TV presenter was previously married to Kirsty Rowley, who he met in 1988 when he was working as a recruitment consultant in Bristol.

They have a daughter called Harriet, 26. \nIn 2007 Kirsty told how their relationship had broken down because of a gambling habit he was battling with. \nShe said Jeremy had ­frittered away £70,000 and had previously run up £4,500 debts at the bookies and on betting phone lines. \nJeremy also spoke about the addiction – which he eventually overcame – in his 2009 book I’m Only Being Honest. \nHe wrote: “Gambling is the mistress that truly seduced me. I will never understand what a hit of heroin feels like, but gambling I get. Big time. \n\"Plenty of days I can remember taking money out of the cashpoint and going to the bookies and then losing and going again to the cashpoint – and back again and again. \n“I would think ‘I’ve got to go now’ but there was this pull and suddenly I was chasing money, trying to achieve something that has never been achieved: making a bookie poor.” \nIn 2012 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer but was given the all-clear after chemotherapy and surgery. \nAside from his daytime show, famed for its lie detector test and confrontational style, he has fronted dozens of programmes for ITV. In 2015 he presented two series of primetime show The Kyle Files. \nHe also presented a 10-part series called Jeremy Kyle’s Emergency Room. The show returned in March 2016. \nAnd last year he also stood in for Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain. \nHe started his career on local radio before getting his break broadcasting on national station Virgin – presenting Jezza’s Virgin Confessions every weeknight. \nIn 2004 he ran a similar Confessions Show on London’s Capital FM. \nIt proved so popular he was poached by TV bosses and in 2007 The Jeremy Kyle Show began.
