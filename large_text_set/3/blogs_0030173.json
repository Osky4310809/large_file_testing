Genuinely wearable and practical options which include a variety of styles, are rarely seen. This is true to the point that actors themselves spend ages working out and prepping for a bikini scene. Since not everyone is comfortable in a bikini, and cannot spend their vacation applying bronzer all over their bodies, and making sure body parts don’t pop out of their stringy swimsuits, a two-piece isn’t always an option. Plus, now that a whole new wave of one-piece swimsuits is on trend again, we think it’s only appropriate to chart the non-bikini celebrity swimsuit looks that anyone can try and look hot as hell in. Kareena’s belted black halter neck one piece, and blue sequinned mermaid one-piece A black swimsuit that is anything but basic, this sexy belted halter neck swimsuit that Kareena sported in Kambakkht Ishq , is perfect for every body type, and sure to set the beach on fire! \nHowever, that isn’t the only Kareena swimsuit look worth emulating. Everyone remembers Kareena Kapoor Khan’s lime-green bikini from the movie Tashan . But her shimmery aquatic look, complete with metallic eye makeup, is both memorable and unique. Nutan’s black one-piece \nThis rarely-mentioned swimsuit moment is often called Bollywood’s first swimsuit look! It’s clean lines and subtle side cut-outs make it a great low-key swimsuit for any wardrobe, and any body type. Plus, its length is perfect for those who are sick of swimsuit bottoms riding up and giving annoying wedgies! Priyanka Chopra’s gilded Dostana look, and exotic nude bandage swimsuit \nPC’s sartorial transformation was cemented by this sequinned, golden look. Etched in the minds of all millennials, it is a sexy and glamorous suit fit for a fancy holiday by the sea, or a pool party worthy of the Oscars. Plus, just think how gorgeous that gold will look against the shimmering sea water in photos! \nBandage dresses might be out, but the bandage swimsuit is still a hot trend. We love how this blush-nude number is the perfect combination of suggestively sultry and demure, making it perfect for a beach vacay. Pamela Anderson’s iconic red suit \nThis iconic swimsuit look is etched in the minds of every person who lived through the nineties and clocked in Baywatch , but is somehow rarely recreated. The classic, simple cut, and hot red colour make it an uncomplicated yet sexy option that should be a staple in our swimwear wardrobe. Katrina’s neon pink cut-out swimsuit \nPerfect for those who want to turn their sexy on without having to wearing a bikini, this fun and hot swimsuit, seen in Baar Baar Dekho , is a cool pick for pool parties as well as a dip in the sea. Elizabeth Taylor’s ethereal white look \nFeminine and sensual, this retro swimsuit look is a gorgeous, classic option that is sure to look stunning in all those beach photos set against the bright blue sea. Urmila Matondkar’s classic black swimsuit \nA swimsuit that is easy to wear, sexy yet understated and non-boring despite all that? Yes, please! The suit’s neckline and snug fit make it the epitome of hot, and screen siren Urmila Matondkar worked the hell out of it in Rangeela . It’s so figure-flattering thanks to strategic ruching, and needs no accessories to look stylish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:29:22.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
