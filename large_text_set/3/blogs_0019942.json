LOUIS • A man who was shot after a gun went off during an assault inside the MetroLink train near Busch Stadium Sunday died Tuesday, police say. \nPolice identified the victim as Mac Payne, 57. \nPayne received his mail at the St. Louis University College Church, 3628 Lindell Boulevard, through the church's program to provide homeless people with addresses and forms of identification, according to a SLU spokesman. The spokesman confirmed that Payne was homeless. \nPayne’s brother, Arthur Payne, described his brother as selfless and “very likable.” \nThe Paynes grew up on the 4800 block of Kossuth Avenue in St. Louis’ Penrose neighborhood. Arthur Payne said his brother lived in their childhood home for a while, along with a few other homes owned by family. \nMac Payne supported himself by picking up and selling scrap metal, his brother said. \nPayne traveled around the city and county a lot, his brother said. He brought his bike with him on the MetroLink or bus to see family in different parts of the area, or to go to different community centers to use the gym and socialize, according to his brother. \n“He would often call me from the library and we would talk about the reading he was doing,” Arther Payne, who lives in Virginia, told the Post-Dispatch. “He was very inquisitive.” \nThe family is still arranging funeral services. \n“He was really, really a special person,” Arthur Payne said. “He was heartfelt, he meant what he said, he was very talkative and he made friends very easily.” \nThe events that led to the shooting of Payne began after a man, 51, and his 29-year-old son boarded a westbound train in Belleville shortly before 10:30 p.m. Four males and two females who appeared to know one another boarded in East St. Louis, police said. \nThe group wanted the man and his son to give them money, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said at the crime scene. About the time the train arrived at the Stadium station at 400 South Eighth Street shortly before 11 p.m., the son reached to give them $5. Someone grabbed the money from the son and began pistol-whipping him in the face. \nThe gun apparently went off during a struggle between the group and the son, and the bullet went through a train window, hitting the victim, who had just exited the train. \nThe attackers fled. The man and son who had been assaulted stayed on the train and met up with police at the Central West End station. They were treated at a hospital for injuries to their faces and released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:16:46.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
