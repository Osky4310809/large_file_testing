It was, Chris said, the “perfect spot to wind-down after a hectic nine months working in New York City.”\nAfter Cadiz, they headed back east to the province of Almeria, famous for the Cabo de Gata National Park and yet more idyllic beaches, before traveling on to the Costa Brava, Blanes and Tossa de Mar.\n“It seems that each trip to Spain leaves me yearning for more,” Chris said. “I have already found myself planning the next adventure to its tempting shores, I suggest that you do the same too.”\nStay tuned for the second part of Chris’s road trip through Spain in the coming days.\nFor more Highsnobiety Travel , explore the dead sea and more in this captivating look at life in Tel Aviv .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:44:54.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
