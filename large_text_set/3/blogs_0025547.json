[PODCAST] In this episode of Indie Film Weekly , we dissect Netflix’s balancing act between the indie and studio worlds—and whether the company really cares about cinema at all. Co-hosts Jon Fusco , Emily Buder , and yours truly, Liz Nord discuss a handful of game-changing Netflix news, and how indie theater guru Tim League threw down the gauntlet against the streaming giant. We also cover why getting your film graded \"F\" could be a good thing, according to IMDB, and a sad goodbye to indie film producer Robin O’Hara ( Raising Victor Vargas , Gummo ). We hear from two directors whose films are hitting theaters this month: Alice Lowe of Prevenge and Sarah Adina Smith of Buster’s Mal Heart . Charles Haine joins us for gear news, including an app that lets you shoot in LOG mode on your phone and his review of the new Sigma Cinema Zoom lenses. As always, the show also brings news you can use about gear, upcoming grant and festival deadlines, this week’s indie film releases, and other notable things you might have missed while you were busy making films.
