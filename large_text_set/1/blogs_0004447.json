Rather than holding computing power and software in itself, the NVIDIA Spot is a small — roughly golfball-sized — peripheral that can be placed anywhere and connect to your Shield Android TV over Wi-Fi.\n\nThe Spot simply acts as a conduit to speaking to Google Assistant on the TV box, and it will then return your answer just like a Pixel or Google Home would today. But because the Spot is small and simple, NVIDIA envisions being able to put multiple Spots throughout your home so it's always available. Any spot can hear you from about 20 feet away, and it'll always send the query to the new Shield Android TV and hand it back to you at the nearest speaker.\nThe spot is shown being plugged directly into a wall power outlet without a cord, meaning placement won't be completely flexible but will of course be extremely simple. And considering the Spot's size, it shouldn't cause any issues taking up a couple power outlets around the house.\nNVIDIA isn't yet spilling additional information of specific availability or pricing for the Spot, but considering that the new Shield Android TV is on its way to everyone later this month we could be seeing details on the Spot quite soon.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:41:21.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
