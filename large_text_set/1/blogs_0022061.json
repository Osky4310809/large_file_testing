They did not maltreat us. At a point, I lost count of how many days we have stayed in the hide out.’’ \nAsides, the victims dropping eyelids suggestive of one deprived of good sleep, the freed five students and three members of staff of the school,did not look ruffled as anticipated, following their long stay in the abductors’ den. \nThe visibly exhilarated students and staff were accompanied by some security agents, management staff of the school and their parents to the waiting embrace of governor Ibikunle Amosun, in his Oke-Mosan office, Abeokuta, a day after they were freed. \nSpeaking to Vanguard on strict condition of anonymity, shortly after the visit to the governor, one of the students revealed that her cry for help gave her away , when the gunmen struck \nHow I was abducted \nAccording to the Junior Secondary School student; “I was in my room when I heard a disturbing sound at the veranda. I was tempted to go and see what was happening but was restrained by instinct. \n”My room mate, who went, screamed and I knew there was trouble. She rushed back into the room with a man following her. From where I hid, I saw the stranger holding her by the wrist with a stern warning for her not to cause any trouble. She started shouting my name, telling me to go and hide. \n”From where I hid, I was shouting Mummy! Mummy!. I believe the stranger heard my voice, as he came close, found me and quietly asked me to come out. I begged him not to harm me and he promised he wouldn’t. \n”They led us out of the school compound, through the bush path, where I saw some other persons. I did not know who they were because the place was dark. It was later I discovered they were my teachers and school mates. \n”I can not tell the exact time we spent getting to their destination but it took over two hours. At a point, I slept off, thinking I was dead. By the time I woke up, it was still dark.” \n”Yesterday (Tuesday), one of them came and said they should take us away. Again, I fell asleep only to wake up on reaching where they dropped us.” \nAt this point, she was interrupted by her father who claimed she had spoken enough. \nEffort to speak with others failed as they were shielded from answering questions.

But the Deputy Governor and the Secretary to the State Government visited the school . \n“When the President called me, I assured him that they would be released on Monday. But when they were not released on Monday, he called again on Tuesday and asked what was happening and I told him that we were close to securing their release, as I was informed that the victims would be released in 24 hours. \n“I was there during one of the sessions when the security operatives were discussing with the kidnappers through a tracking device. I just refrained from talking to them . \n”They (operatives) had tracked them (kidnappers) to their hideout where they kept the students and workers but the security operatives did not want to storm the place because of the safety of the victims. \n“I want to assure the kidnappers that they will pay dearly for this because this is Ogun State, where we don’t allow criminals to operate. Ogun State will not be a comfort zone for them to operate. Anybody who wants to do business with a good intention is welcome but we will not indulge anyone who intends to give us a bad name.’’ \nHow they were released \nCommissioner of Police, Ogun State Police Command, Mr Ahmed Illyasu, on his part, explained that a cutting edge technology and high profile mechanism were involved in the rescue of the victims. \nHe said “the deployment of a technically-driven team of intelligence response system of the Inspector General of Police yesterday, forced the miscreants to submit , thereby leading to the rescue of the victims. Also, some high profile suspects were arrested. The operation is on a large scale and it is still ongoing. Definitely, this is not the end of the operation. \nSchool MD’s account \nIn his remarks, Managing Director, Turkish school, Mr Orhan Kertim expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Amosun, the Inspector General of Police, as well as Director General of State Security Service and the Military for their efforts and support towards the release of the abducted persons. \nDescribing the period of wait as a difficult one for all, he said: “The 11 days of waiting were sleepless nights. But there were hopes as prayers were rendered. I also want to use this medium to state that during that period, concerned parents showed tremendous solidarity and thereafter , alhamdulillah , we have passed all these bad things.” \nVictims’ parents too \nSpeaking on behalf of the concerned parents, Deputy Managing Director of The Sun Newspaper, Mr Steve Nwosu, expressed gratitude to security agents who put in efforts in the release of the students and staff. \nHe said: “Yes, even if anybody has any misgivings, the important thing is the result and we are very happy. The governor, we must thank you for everything you did, we got to know indirectly, we knew what was happening. As a media person, I understand one or two things that was happening. \n“ On behalf of the parents and the children, we want to say a big thank you to everybody that participated in bringing back these children and we say may none of you experience what we experienced.” \nSuspect arrested \nOne of the suspected kidnappers who confessed to have taken part in the abduction of the students and staff was arrested yesterday at Ikorodu area of Lagos State, after leaving the creeks. \nThe suspect, whose identify was given simply as Bekewei, was reportedly trailed by operatives of the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team, IRT, to Ikorodu area of Lagos, few hours after he came out of the creeks to spend his share of the loot. \nCash of N1.2 million, suspected to part of his share of the ransom paid for the release of the students and staff was allegedly recovered from him. \nPolice sources hinted that some policemen were deployed to the shorelines of the creeks across Ikorodu, Epe, Arepo, Ibafon and Shagamu areas of Lagos and Ogun states to monitor movements of persons in and out of those places. \nThe effort paid off few hours after the girls were released, as Bekewei, was spotted and subsequently apprehended. \nDuring interrogation, he reportedly confessed to have taken part in the kidnap of the NTIC students and staff, adding that he got N2 million as his share of the ransom paid for their release. \nBekewei, as gathered, confessed that out of his share, he sent N800,000 to an undisclosed person in his home town, Arogbo, Ondo State, adding that he also gave N50,000 each to two of his girlfriends in Lagos before he was arrested. \nPolice not aware of ransom \nCommenting on the release of the abducted victims, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Kayode Aderanti said; “ I am not aware if ransom was paid. Police is not involved in ransom . I only read it in the papers . One thing we know is that they have been rescued and reunited with their parents. They were examined yesterday(Tuesday), Although they are traumatise they were otherwise okay. \nAll we demand from Nigerians is to believe in the Police.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:02:14.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
