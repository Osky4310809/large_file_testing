We’ll join any and all of your awesome lady book clubs , thank you very much.)\nThe whole thing began on Tuesday, January 31st , when Kardashian asked Twitter for some book recommendations, noting that she loves to read before she falls asleep. (Same, girl.) Fans chimed in with suggestions ranging from Valley of the Dolls to Animorphs , but clearly, Kardashian wanted more — and on Wednesday night, she officially announced that she, Teigen, and celebrity hairstylist we cannot afford Jen Atkin were starting a book club.\nIt sounds like it was Kardashian’s idea, which means she gets to choose the first book.\nI'm making them read \"Embraced By The Light\" as our first book!\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 2, 2017 Embraced by the Light is one woman’s story of dying during surgery, then finding “proof” of life after death before returning to write a book about it.\nTeigen, always direct, let fans know how they too can get in on this action.\nI think you just get the book and read, my dude / dudette https://t.co/yZy5wllBJ4 \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 2, 2017 Kardashian is all-caps excited.\nEveryone's invited!!!! https://t.co/s38JrvD7NL \n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 2, 2017 For what it’s worth we’re totally down, and are all about celebrities publicly starting book clubs if it gets their legions of fans reading. (Maybe next month they can do something like Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine or Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale , to possibly get these same fans more riled up to protest the Trump/Pence administration? Two birds, one stone?)\nBut also, come on, guys — a book club isn’t really a book club unless you invite us all to your house for a wine-fueled potluck and book discussion that devolves into a Vanderpump Rules discussion within 20 minutes. We know you’re down, Chrissy!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T20:56:16.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
