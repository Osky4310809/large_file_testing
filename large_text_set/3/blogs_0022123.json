FACEBOOK Facebook Safety Check lets you mark yourself as safe \nFacebook also turned on Safety Check following the terrorist attacks in Paris last October in which 130 people died, allowing those caught up in the tragedy to let their loved ones know they were safe. \nAnd it was also activated after the attacks on Brussels airport in March which left 32 people dead, and the Orlando shooting in Florida last June. \nThe company had been criticised for its apparent refusal to use Safety Check for a number of major incidents, but a Facebook spokesperson said that it could soon be able to allow individual users to turn on the feature themselves.
