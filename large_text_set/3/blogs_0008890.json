A built-in microphone makes Hushme entirely hands-free. \nUnveiled at January’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the neckband-style gadget promises to muffle phone conversations from the outside world. \nWhether you’re chatting top-secret details or just have some sense of decency toward co-workers, the personal acoustic device uses passive voice suppression and active voice-masking technology—i.e. thick padding that deadens your voice.\nPlus, an accompanying mobile app lets users pipe sounds through external speakers: Lull folks into a trance with the noise of wind, ocean, or rain; mock them with bird, monkey, and squirrel calls; and entertain them with Darth Vader breathing, R2-D2 beeps, or Minion squeals. \nJudging by a promotional video (above), Hushme is geared at office workers. But there’s no stopping owners from donning the device in public—on a train or in a restaurant—anywhere you may want to carry on a private discussion among nosy neighbors. \nHushme, which appears to come in a simple black or silver finish, also doubles as a portable wireless speaker or a Bane mask come Halloween. \nHushme\nBrainchild of Ukranian engineers, the headset, expected to cost $200 or less, is prepping for its crowdfunding debut sometime this year, according to Engadget . \nThe tech news blog, which got a hands-on look at the gadget during CES, also tipped the possibility of “straight-up voice changing” technology, which serves no apparent purpose, but could prove a fun function for future users.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T08:33:36.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
