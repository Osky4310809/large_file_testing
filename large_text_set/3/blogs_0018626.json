They improved on their lacklustre efforts up to that point and helped out Strootman, who had been practically doing it all on his own. Their centre forward playing like a proper forward when brought on was another plus, especially given the strange funk that afflicted him in the one-goal aggregate defeat against Lyon. If Roma are to take anything from this season they'll need Sunday night's Dzeko, not Thursday's. \nNegatives \nRoma can count themselves lucky that Defrel had to leave the field with an ankle knock before the hour. The Frenchman was causing the hosts all sorts of problems, and his replacement, Alessandro Matri, didn't offer anything like the same threat. Too often Roma's defensive line was pulled out of position by a team that in any other season would be looking over their shoulders and worrying about relegation. \nManager rating \n6 -- Made the right substitutions when he had to, and his second-half change from a back three to a back four gave his team extra stability, but his starting front line of Radja Nainggolan, Salah and El Shaarawy didn't work. \nGK Wojciech Szczesny, 7 -- When Roma were wobbling the Pole was there to stave off further embarrassment. \nDF Kostas Manolas, 6 -- Much like Federico Fazio, the Greek seemed all at sea in the opening period but was much more comfortable once Defrel hurt his ankle and Roma moved to a back four. \nDF Federico Fazio, 6 -- Didn't really know what to make of Defrel, and struggled to get a hold of the game for a while. His great pass for El Shaarawy did lead to Salah's goal, however. \nDF Antonio Rudiger, 7 -- Solid both on the left of the back-three and as a right-back following Bruno Peres' removal. Edin Dzeko scored in the 68th minute after being subbed into the game. \nMF Bruno Peres, 5 -- Another odd display to add to his growing collection. Needs to look over the other side of the pitch and take notes. \nMF Leandro Paredes, 7 -- Unlucky that Strootman was in such fine fettle, otherwise people would have been talking about him and his superb goal instead. \nMF Kevin Strootman, 9 -- An immense display at the heart of the midfield capped off with a delightful assist for Dzeko. \nMF Emerson Palmieri, 8 -- Crashed the bar with a thumping first-half shot and carried out his defensive duties with rare purpose. \nAM Radja Nainggolan, 6 -- The Belgian has been below par ever since starring against Inter Milan a few weeks back, and this was another low-key evening. \nAM Stephan El Shaarawy, 6 -- It's hard to work out what kind of player he wants to be. Full of effort but lacking guile, he was nowhere near his thunderous midweek display. \nFW Mohamed Salah, 6 -- His goal, which should have been ruled out, can't mask that he struggles without Dzeko alongside him. \nSubstitutes \nFW Edin Dzeko, 7 -- Could easily have had a hat trick within 10 minutes of coming on. Took his goal brilliantly and gave Roma another dimension. \nAM Diego Perotti, N/R -- Offered more in 15 minutes than Salah did for 75. Wasted on the bench. \nMF Daniele De Rossi, N/R -- Three minutes at the end of a match that was already over as a contest. \nTerry is based in Rome and is ESPN FC's AS Roma blogger.
