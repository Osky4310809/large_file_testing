So, it seems, is the case with Lightning McQueen's paint job in Disney/Pixar 's Cars movies. \nDisney has finally released a full trailer for their forthcoming Cars 3 , which centers on McQueen's recovery and return to racing after a debilitating crash. (Photo: Disney/Pixar) \nThanks to tonight's first full theatrical trailer, audiences have their first peek at what he will look like once he gets his new paint job -- presumably after the accident. \nThis isn't the first time Lightning has had a new look: near the end of Cars , he frequented every business in Radiator Springs before leaving town, including Ramon's House of Body Art, where he got a sleeker, less commercial repaint. \nAt the start of Cars 2 , Lightning's look was materially the same as his appearance in Cars , except that his hood space, home to a Rust-Eze logo in the first movie, instead featured a decal indicating that he had won the Piston Cup in between films. \nThis time, it appears as though his appearance in the early scenes, before the accident, will be essentially the same look with a few minor tweaks -- the green is gone in the flames on Lightning's side, replaced with a less-garish white outline for the decal, and the Rust-Eze logo appears behind his rear wheel wells. That's the image fans have already seen in the original teaser for the movie, and the poster currently hanging in theaters. \nThere are other shots in the trailer, though, that depict Lightning with the flames completely gone, and his lightning bolt shot through with a shiny, reflective \"Rust-Eze.\" [ Note: This is actually just an updated version of his Cars look, which didn't have the green or the flames.] \nThere's another Rust-Eze -- big enough that it doesn't completely fit, and also reflective gold -- on his rear end, and both his name (above the doors) and the red \"95\" on his side is reflective as well. The 95 appears to be just red, reflective paint and lacks the bold outline of black and green that it's previously featured. \nThe movie is headed to theaters in the early summer, and given how pervasive the toy lines are for Cars , don't be surprised if you see both the pre-crash and reflective post-crash versions of McQueen on store shelves soon. \nBlindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves. To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician with her own plan to win, inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet, and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn't through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing's biggest stage! \nCars 3 is set to debut in theaters on June 16, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T05:57:03.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
