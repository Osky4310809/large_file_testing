If you need to read this prayer, you’re not Christian (re: Melania).” \n“God Bless her, but listening to Melania do 'The Lord’s Prayer' sounds like someone getting cursed to become a 'Dracula,'@carnojoe wrote. \n“Melania starts the dictatorship rally with the Lord’s Prayer? NOT EVERY AMERICAN IS CHRISTIAN!!!! Country over party,” tweeted @JaimePrimak. \nSome even took personal shots at the first lady, calling her a “whore.” \n“…plus melania read the 'our father' like a whore in confession after a night of escorting,” @ TrumpUriNation wrote in a tweet that has since been deleted. \nStay classy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:13:46.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
