As you can gather from the title of the song, it’s all about counting those blessings. \nIn speaking on Ty and the joint work, the Christian rapper revealed to Rolling Stone : “I had just been a fan of his work then I came to find out he was a mutual fan of my work. I sent him a couple records. He liked some of them, and ‘Blessings’ was the one that stuck.”\n“Blessings” will appear on Lecrae’s upcoming album, due out later this year. \nFor more music, see below to watch NAV lose himself in a trippy purple haze in “Myself.” \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:23:05.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
