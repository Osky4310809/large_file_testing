Read more Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips 'cost taxpayers $3 million' each \nA fringe political figure in Florida, he is known as “Michael the Black Man”, an anti-gay and anti-liberal preacher, previously known as Maurice Woodside, according to the Miami New Times . \nHe is former member of the murderous Yahweh ben Yahweh cult, which means “The Lord Son of the Lords” in Hebrew and was led by the preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. \nIn 1990, Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh ben Yahweh followers, was accused of conspiring in two murders. His brother also told the court Michael had stabbed a man in the eye with a sharp stick but the jury found him innocent. \nHe has since been charged with four other felonies but has never been sentenced and he started his own religious enterprise, the Miami newspaper reported. \nIn the 1990s, Mr Mitchell, leader of the black separatist sect, who adopted the name of Yahweh and declared himself the Messiah, was accused of three counts of federal racketeering and extortion charges, including 14 killings, two attempted killings, extortion and arson. \nMembers of the group, who disagreed with its leader, were said to be killed, including on one occasion beheaded, the New York Times reported. \nTwo years later, Yahweh was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. \nThe preacher died in Miami in 2007 at the age of 71-years-old. \nMichael has also made a name for himself for his vehement criticism of Barack Obama , who he referred to as “The Beast”, an apocalyptic figure in the Bible.
