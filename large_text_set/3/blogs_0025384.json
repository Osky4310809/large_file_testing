It traded hands once again in 2015, and, having undergone a respectful restoration and updating courtesy of Marmol Radziner , it is now making only its third-ever appearance on the market. \nMeasuring 1,972 square feet, the buffed-and-polished residence has three bedrooms, two baths, and such midcentury modern calling cards as sliding glass walls, clerestory windows, and a stacked stone fireplace. \nOther noteworthy features include a heated pool, lush gardens designed by Isamu Watanabe, and panoramic views.
