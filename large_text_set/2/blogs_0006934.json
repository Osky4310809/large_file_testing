Shocker,” and “Plank is not a local. He does not live in Baltimore. He is not about Baltimore. He is, himself, an occupying, colonizing, culturally appropriating force.” \n“There’s a real difference between attacking a person and attacking a system of oppression,” Dorsey said. \nDorsey said the Port Covington project will further segregate the City. His comments, unleashed a wave of push-back from other city leaders. \n“The city council is elected by the people of the City and I think there’s no room for any of us to chastise anyone who makes contributions to the City,” Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said. \nDorsey was elected in November to represent northeast Baltimore. He has been very outspoken about racial inequality. \nWJZ reached out to Plank for a comment and received a statement from Plank Industries CEO Tom Geddes: \n“I hope that Mr. Dorsey will quickly learn that it is possible to have robust public discussions about civic priorities without resorting to false accusations. Such behavior is entirely unworthy of his office. Kevin Plank’s commitment to Baltimore is unparalleled. He is proud to grow Under Armour here and to continue his significant personal investments and philanthropic contributions to this great City.” \nPlank’s development company, Sagamore, is building the $5.5 billion dollar project. It will include a new headquarters for Under Armour, housing, restaurants and shops. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook Amy Yensi Amy Yensi joined WJZ Eyewitness News in March 2015 as a general assignment reporter.
