Jennifer Perkins, electrician \nMs Perkins has been a licensed electrician for 31 years and teaches electrotechnology at the TAFE NSW Kogarah and Gymea campuses. \n\"I've only got four women students out of a cohort of 500. \n\"There were a couple of job interviews once where the interviewer questioned whether I'd be able to handle the men in the environment, which I was really surprised at. That was their negative attitude. \n\"I've always seen myself as an equal to the male electricians, so if they've thought any different that's their issue.\" Kylie Morgan, aircraft engineer \nMs Morgan has been a qualified licensed aircraft maintenance engineer for just over 26 years and started with a four-year apprenticeship. \n\"Here at Domestic there's three girls in a crew of 83. \n\"I've never really thought about it to be honest. We're all just part of the crew and we work together and we treat each other accordingly. \n\"I don't see my workmates as men and I don't see myself as a woman as something different.\" Terri Bournazos, light-vehicle mechanic \nMs Bournazos has been a light-vehicle mechanic for 10 years. \n\"For my three years at TAFE I was the only girl. \n\"The only issue I had was classmates with sexist comments, the usual with teenage early adult males. It got nipped in the bud pretty quickly by myself and the teachers. \n\"But workplace, colleagues, bosses — I've never had an issue. \n\"A lot of customers say how amazing it is to see a woman in the workshop.\" Simone Curry, carpenter and decorator \nMs Curry is a self-employed handywoman and has worked as a carpenter for 17 years. \n\"Being a woman works in my favour. \n\"When I first started out as a young apprentice, I stood out and I had to prove I was strong enough, quick enough. But now, my business is a niche. \n\"Women really appreciate it; they feel safer and they feel and know I'm not trying to rip them off by treating them like an idiot. I treat them with respect. \n\"I'm lucky because I love my work and it gives me the ability to support my children and organise my work around their care.\" Fi Shewring, painter and decorator Photo: Fi Shewring, painter and decorator. (ABC Radio Sydney: Amanda Hoh) \nMs Shewring has been in the trade for 26 years and was the founder of community group Support and Linking Tradeswomen (SALT). \n\"I'm used to being watched, I'm used to people checking to see if I know what I'm doing. \n\"On my very first job, I had a tradie come into the room and say, 'hey, I've never seen a woman on site before, good on you'. Then there were others who just gave me a death stare and didn't want me on the job. \n\"But as soon as you establish you know what you're doing and they're happy with what they're getting, then they stop watching you as much.\" Louise Azzopardi, heavy-vehicle mechanic Photo: Louise Azzopardi, heavy-vehicle mechanic. (ABC Radio Sydney: Amanda Hoh) \nMs Azzopardi has been repairing and maintaining heavy machinery and trucks for six years and is the national heavy vehicle mechanic champion in the WorldSkills competition. \n\"Where I'm working now, I'm the only girl. It's normal to me. The boys don't really have a problem with it. \n\"I love the nature of the work; how you can really see what you're doing — like when you're repairing an engine that isn't working, then you see it working. \n\"During the apprenticeship, sometimes some of the boys don't want you there, but in the end it's worth it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:24:26.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
