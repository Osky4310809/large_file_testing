POLITICO reported that Trump adviser Carter Page also met with Kislyak at the RNC Convention. While in office, Harry Reid had asked Comey to investigate Carter, saying he was also meeting with “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow. Carter told MSNBC he had met with Kislyak , then seemed to backtrack on CNN to say he never spoke with him for more than 10 seconds . Kushner and Flynn also met with Kislyak at the Trump Tower in December. Of note, given the venue and people involved, this points to Trump having direct knowledge of the meeting. Kislyak did not attend the DNC Convention. Trump team forced Nikki Haley to fire career staffers who she had asked for advice on how to talk tough with Russia. A front page story in USA Today reported that emails released under a FOIA request to The Indianapolis Star, show Pence used personal email for state business while governor , including for sensitive matters and homeland security issues, and that his personal AOL account was hacked. The next day, Pence turned over 13 boxes of state-related emails to the Indiana statehouse — a step required by law. Trump’s transition team canceled planned training on ethics for his staff, appointees and Cabinet members. Rachel Maddow reported on a leaked DHS assessment document which indicates most US-based extremists radicalized years after entry into the US. These findings negate the main argument made by the Trump regime for their Muslim Ban, and may explain why they have yet to release the new version frequently promised to be coming soon. Inhumane round-ups by ICE continued, including a father of four US-born children who has lived here for 20 years , while dropping his kids off at school. A 22 year-old immigrant was detained by ICE moments after a press conference . She was 7 when her family moved to the US from Argentina, placing her under DACA immigration policy. Spicer was reported to be checking his staff phones for leaks. Reuters reported on stepped up efforts by the Trump regime to plug leaks, including Mnuchin using his first senior staff meeting to inform his aides that he would not tolerate leaks. FP reported that the Trump WH is considering using high-end security software for WH networks in an effort to stop leaks. Schwarzenegger quit The Celebrity Apprentice , citing too much “baggage” — a clear shot at Trump. Trump continues his role as Executive Producer of the show (which we’ve normalized!). Trump fired back via Twitter this next day claiming Schwarzenegger was fired because of low ratings. Schwarzenegger told him to hire a fact checker. As stories continued all week about Trump and his team’s ties to Russia, offering no proof, Trump accused Obama of wiretapping phones in Trump Tower, tweeting, “This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!” As the week closed out, Trump yet again headed to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, after leaving the WH at 3 p.m. on Friday. Trump has yet to visit Camp David. Some Things We’ve Already Normalized: Trump’s sons are continuing to conduct business from which Trump has a direct economic benefit. Our executive branch is vastly understaffed, and Trump and his regime seem to make little effort at hiring (consolidation of power). Our media (some) continue to push the notion of a Trump “reset,” and seek to normalize Trump and his regime. Comey continues to NOT cooperate with Congress in hearings. We also do not know the status of the DOJ inquiry into Comey and the FBI, and whether this has been allowed to continue under Sessions Past weeks:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T19:45:33.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
