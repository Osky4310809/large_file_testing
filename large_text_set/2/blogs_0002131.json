The draft of the executive order circulated on February 1, 2017 would prohibit the federal government from withholding grants, contracts, or federal benefits from entities that discriminate against LGBT employees or beneficiaries based on religious objection—a belief that being LGBT is immoral or inconsistent with religious doctrine. \nSuch an executive order could potentially impact thousands of same-sex couples seeking to adopt or foster children, tens of thousands of LGBT youth in foster care, and hundreds of thousands of LGBT workers employed by federal contractors and the federal government. \nThe Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law is providing this fact sheet to assist with reporting on these issues. Williams Institute scholars are available to provide comment and analysis. \nSame-Sex Couples Seeking to Adopt or Foster Children \nThe draft executive order would allow federally-funded religious organizations providing child welfare services to decline adoption and foster services to same-sex couples. Williams Institute research shows that many same-sex couples adopt and foster children, and are more likely to do so than different-sex couples: \n–More than 16,000 same-sex couples are raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the U.S. \n–Same-sex couples are four times more likely to be raising adopted children than different-sex couples. \n–Approximately 2,600 same-sex couples are raising an estimated 3,400 foster children in the U.S. \n–Same-sex couples are six times more likely to be fostering children than different-sex couples. \nThe draft executive order could limit opportunities for family formation among same-sex couples, and leave many children without a foster placement or permanent home. \nLGBT Youth in Foster Care \nThe draft executive order would allow religious organizations providing child welfare services to decline to serve LGBT youth. Williams Institute research finds that LGBT youth are greatly overrepresented in the foster system; for example, in Los Angeles, LGBT youth make up 20 percent of the youth population in care, compared to only 8 percent of the general youth population. Of the 400,000 children currently in foster care, an estimated 80,000 are LGBT. \nLGBT Employees of Federal Contractors \nOver 20 percent of the U.S. workforce – 28 million people – are employed by federal contractors. Under an executive order issued by former President Obama in 2014, federal contractors are prohibited from discriminating against their employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity. President Trump’s draft order would limit the scope of the 2014 order, allowing contractors to discriminate against LGBT employees based on their religious beliefs without losing their contracts. \nThe Williams Institute estimated that as a result of the 2014 executive order, 11 million workers, including 400,000 LGBT employees, gained protections from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. These 11 million employees did not have protections from sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination under a corporate policy or state law before the 2014 order was issued. \nThe draft order would potentially strip an important source of legal protections from many LGBT workers of federal contractors, including workers who are not otherwise protected from discrimination under state non-discrimination laws or corporate policies. \nLGBT Federal Employees \nThe draft order would open the door for harassment and discrimination against LGBT people who work for the federal government. An estimated 64,000 LGBT people are federal civil service employees. \nServices Provided to Same-Sex Couples \nThe draft order would open the door for denial of services and discrimination against same-sex married couples. There are over 500,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S. \nAccess to Health Care \nThe draft order would limit federal regulations that protect LGBT people from discrimination in health care, including by hospitals, insurers, and other providers. There are over 10 million LGBT adults in the United States. In particular, the over 1.4 million transgender adults in the U.S. would be vulnerable to discrimination in health care and denial of services under the draft order.
