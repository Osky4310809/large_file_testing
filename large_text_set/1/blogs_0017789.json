My stunt, my stunt,’” Lee said after the game. “So I’m thinking it’s a player because it’s happening so fast.”\nCarmelo Anthony passed the ball to Lee, who was in position to take an open, game-tying three-pointer. Lee opted to drive by Wizards forward Kelly Oubre instead, before passing to Brandon Jennings — a play that led to a game-sealing turnover.\nCourtney Lee says a sly tactic from a Wizards assistant coach tricked him into thinking he had help on the last possession. pic.twitter.com/UhwGIT9JQK \n— Kristian Winfield (@Krisplashed) January 20, 2017 Lee said when he got the ball on New York’s final possession, he saw Oubre in front of him. But when he heard “I got your help, I’m right here, I’m right here,” he pump faked instead of shooting the ball. It wasn’t until after the play that Lee found out it was a Wizards assistant coach yelling in his ear.\nAsked if he had enough time to shoot the three-pointer before Oubre closed out, Lee said: “I definitely did. Not hearing that voice and thinking it was a player, I definitely had enough time to shoot.\n“I can’t say if he did it on purpose or not. I’ve never been in that situation and I’ve never seen it before.”\nAccording to the NBA rulebook, an official is to assess a technical foul for “a coach entering onto the court without permission.”\nLowe stood directly in front of the official on the three-point wing during the Knicks’ final possession. Lee feels the NBA should investigate, though he still made the wrong decision.\n“I think it’s something they need to take a look at,” he said. “Being a basketball player, you play off instincts, and if you hear somebody right there, that’s why I tried to make the right play, but I still should have shot it.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T07:38:43.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
