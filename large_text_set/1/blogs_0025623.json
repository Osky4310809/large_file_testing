We are deeply concerned by President Donald J. Trump’s recent executive order on immigrants and refugees . The executive order places a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States, with an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria. It bars citizens and US green card holders from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia from entering the United States for 90 days. At the time of writing this petition, the administration continues to reinterpret the executive order, leaving individuals anxious and confused about whether they or their loved ones are impacted directly. Each of the countries singled out in this executive order is a Muslim-majority country. President Trump has stated that he will give priority to refugees of Christian faith, indicating he views the executive order as a step toward the complete Muslim ban he promised during his campaign . The executive order is a direct threat to the health and well-being of thousands of refugees worldwide who are fleeing violence and persecution by denying them consideration for refugee status in the United States. The executive order also poses significant risk to DFCI patients from barred countries who may no longer be able to travel between their home country and DFCI for their medical care, including patients who are permanent residents of the United States. Photo by Colleen Farrell President Trump’s executive order has additionally jeopardized the ability of health professions students, researchers, and clinicians from the barred countries who work legally in the United States to care for patients and advance medical knowledge. For example, Samira Asgari, PhD, was barred from entering the United States to begin her post-doctoral research on tuberculosis at Brigham and Women’s Hospital because she is from Iran. Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, PhD, also Iranian, had planned to begin post-doctoral research on cardiovascular disease at Brigham and Women’s hospital, but had his visa indefinitely suspended . Suha Abushamma, an internal medicine resident at the Cleveland Clinic who holds a Sudanese passport, was forced on a plane to Saudi Arabia after arriving at JFK airport on Friday, January 27th. Asgari, Saravi and Abushamma had all been previously granted work visas by the US government. The Mar-a-Lago Club, which is part of the Trump Organization, has been referred to by President Donald J. Trump as the “ Winter White House .” President Trump has appointed his son , Donald J. Trump Jr, as official director of the Mar-a-Lago club. Ethics lawyers have repeatedly expressed concern that President Trump has not established a sufficient plan for distancing himself from his business interests while serving as president. Since 2011 DFCI has paid $150,000 per year to hold the annual fundraiser at the Trump Organization Club. Given President Trump’s close ties to the Mar-a-Lago Club, to continue to provide money to this club and hold an event there is tantamount to endorsing President Trump, including his recent executive order on immigration and refugees. Photo by Colleen Farrell The Dana Farber Care Institute prides itself on being “ recognized as a leader in diversity .” Among its core values are compassion and respect. The DFCI is committed to “[designing] programs that promote public health particularly among high-risk and underserved populations, and [disseminating] innovative patient therapies and scientific discoveries to our target community across the United States and throughout the world.” We applaud the DFCI’s compassionate care for patients, its groundbreaking research, and its efforts to raise funds to continue this life-saving mission. The advancement of the overall mission of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute cannot come at the expense of the most vulnerable among us. In her January 29th email to the Harvard Community, President Drew Faust wrote, “I [urge] the Harvard community to affirm fundamental values of inclusion and belonging, and to model the respect for people and ideas that rest at the heart of any academic community. Our responsibility to each other requires us to demonstrate that we are enriched by difference and respectful disagreement, and to support any individuals in our community who feel vulnerable or unsafe.” We applaud President Faust’s leadership. At this time of unprecedented uncertainty in the United States, we call on DFCI, as an integral institution of the Harvard Community and a global leader in cancer care and research, to take a strong stand for the health and wellbeing of all patients, no matter their religion or nation of origin. By relocating the Discovery Celebration fundraiser, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute will demonstrate its core values to the nation, to the medical community, and most importantly, to patients.
