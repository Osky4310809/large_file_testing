Detective Jerry Walker (Little Elm Police Department) \nDetective Jerry Walker, 48, was in Harrison's office Tuesday afternoon, discussing drug activity in the town, when they were notified of an armed, barricaded man at a home in a nearby neighborhood. \nAuthorities were called to the scene in the 1400 block of Turtle Cove Drive by a passer-by who reported seeing a man with a gun around 3:30 p.m. \nThe responding officers found the man — identified by family as Rudy Garcia— who was holding a long gun, in the backyard of the home. \nThe man retreated into the house when officers told him to drop the weapon. At that point, officers called for a SWAT team and started to set up a perimeter around the home. \nThe gunman would not step outside the house again, Harrison said. \nWalker was one of the first SWAT officers to arrive, and he made his way to an observation point the intersection of Turtle Cove and Waterview drives. A patrol officer was already there. \nAs a marksman observer armed with a rifle and sight, Walker would relay information to the officer in command of the scene. Law-enforcement officials did not know at that time where the gunman was located in the house. \nAround 4 p.m., a shot was fired from the house toward the street. \nHarrison, speaking to Walker on the radio, asked whether he could tell where the round had been fired from. \n\"I think that he's shooting at us,\" Walker responded. Little Elm police chief gives update on detective's fatal shooting at standoff \nAt that moment, a \"hail of gunfire\" from inside the home engulfed the officers and Walker immediately fell to the ground. Two officers returned fire. \nThe exchange lasted less than a minute, said Harrison, who watched the scene unfold from about 50 yards away. \nParamedics and another SWAT officer rushed to the intersection, and they loaded Walker into a patrol officer's SUV. He was driven away from the scene and then taken by air ambulance to Medical City Denton, where he died. Scene of house where gunman shot Det. Walker.

They safely got her out through a first-floor window at the back of the house. Rudy Garcia (via Facebook) \nAround the same time, the sheriff's office used an armored vehicle to create a hole in the front of the home. They deployed a robot into the house, and shortly after 10 p.m. were able to confirm that the gunman was dead. His cause of death was not released. \nWFAA-TV (Channel 8) has reported that the family of Rudy Garcia says he was the suspect in the shooting. Public records indicate that someone by that name lived at the home. \nAccording to jail records, Garcia had been arrested a number of times in Denton County since 2002 on charges that included assault, driving while intoxicated and evading arrest. \nLt. Orlando Hinojosa, a spokesman for the Denton County Sheriff's Office, said he could not confirm that Garcia was the gunman because the medical examiner had yet to release an identity. \nThe Texas Rangers had taken over the scene of the shooting, Harrison said, and they were working Wednesday to determine where the gunshots had been fired from. A medical examiner had also been in the home, he said. \nPolice had been called to the home in the past, and Harrison said authorities were trying to determine whether any of those calls could help explain why Tuesday's incident became deadly. \nHarrison said the shooting has been \"very, very tough\" on his department, adding that very few of his officers had had to deal with a situation like this before. \nHe praised Little Elm residents and other law-enforcement agencies for their response. \n\"The outpouring from the community has been phenomenal,\" he said. \nThe police department was working with Walker's family on funeral arrangements, and a fund has been set up for his relatives. Donations can be mailed to the Jerry Walker Fund, care of Theresa Rocha at Capital One Bank, 2821 E. Eldorado Parkway, Frisco TX 75034. Donations may also be made by calling 214-544-4832.
