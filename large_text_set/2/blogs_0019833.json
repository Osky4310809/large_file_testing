The landmark ruling against the now 20-year-old Sergeant Elor Azaria marked the first time a member of the IDF had been convicted of the charge in 12 years. The prosecution had sought a sentence of between three - five years. Azaria, who was given 18 months jail time and 12 months probation for the Hebron killing of Abdel Fattah al-Sharif on Tuesday, had asked beforehand for the judges to \"show mercy\" to him and his family. The medic was also demoted to Private.

There have been several fundraisers and protests in support of Azaria, and high profile calls for the young recruit to be given a pardon by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Around 100 supporters waited outside the court, continuing to protest the guilty ruling. His defence team had already said they will appeal the conviction. \nMore follows", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:00:36.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
