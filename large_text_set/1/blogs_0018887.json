A reported 90 percent of all wagers that have been taken by the London-based bookmaker Ladbrokes have been on Trump not finishing his term. \nAnd according to Ireland-based bookmaker Paddy Power, think it will happen very quickly. That company is offering a wager on the date of a possible Trump impeachment. Most of their customers think it will happen within six months. The odds on that possibility have crashed from 8-1 to 4-1. \n[ image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T18:50:54.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
