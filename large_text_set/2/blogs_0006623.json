Batman has starred in masterpiece video games, comic book, TV shows, live action movies , animation — pretty much any form of human expression. Hell, The Lego Batman Movie itself is an animated movie based around a toy — three genres Batman has dominated. And so, we decided to point out the best of Batman from every medium he's ever appeared in. Video Game - Arkham Asylum \n(source) \nBatman: Arkham Asylum ’s gameplay, story, and voice acting (both Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy return as the Joker and Batman, respectively) made it an experience not to be missed. It has since had three sequels, and while the series seems to be on pause for now, I wouldn't expect it to be long before we see another game in the Arkham-verse. Movie - The Dark Knight \nShowcasing a stark battle between Batman and The Joker, The Dark Knight was one of the most influential films of the past ten years. After Christopher Nolan's dark, gritty films, every superhero movie became a serious affair (often to their detriment). Still, the popularity of The Dark Knight forced the Academy to expand their Best Picture category to ten when it wasn't nominated. TV Series - Batman: The Animated Series \nAlthough one could make an argument for the Adam West Batman , there really is no better Batman TV show than The Animated Series . Although Tim Burton is often credited for introducing the bleak, gothic noir style to Batman, it was The Animated Series that brought it to the greater DC Universe. What’s more, this version of Batman lasted for an unbelievable 15 years throughout Superman: The Animated Series , Justice League , and Justice League Unlimited . Truly. it is one of the greats. Book - \"The Joker’s Greatest Triumph\" \n(source) \nEven when DC isn’t involved, it’s hard to escape Batman’s influence. Donald Barthleme, the brilliant post-modern short story writer who influenced everyone from Dave Eggers to many writers at DC Comics, wrote a purposefully wooden and strange story of the Joker gaining victory over Batman. It was an influential short story, and opened up the gates for a greater pop culture element in literary fiction. Comic - \"Batman: Year One\" \n(source) \nThe best Batman graphic novels could be a list in and of itself, so it’s near impossible to choose one. But \"Batman: Year One\", Frank Miller’s serious and realistic take on both Batman’s and Gordon's origins, is one of the most influential comics of all time — for Batman, or otherwise. Frank Miller’s other Batman comic, The Dark Knight Returns , could also claim the Best Batman Comic spot, but it's aged poorly in recent years, and a bunch of terrible sequels has diminished it. Meanwhile, \"Year One\" remains a beautiful beast all its own! Music - Batman ‘66 Theme Song \nBatman gave us one of the greatest TV theme songs of all time, and if that’s not an indelible contribution to music, I don’t know what is. \nWhat do you think of our Batman picks?
