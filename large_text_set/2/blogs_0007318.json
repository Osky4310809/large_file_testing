Asier Illarramendi (R) scores Real Sociedad's winner \nAnd the superb goal from the former Real Madrid midfielder proved to be the winner as Sociedad moved into fourth place in La Liga at the expense of Atletico Madrid. \nDiego Simeone's side have the chance to respond on Sunday evening when they take on Celta Vigo, live on Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports Mix . \nWatch Asier Illarramendi's thunderbolt by hitting play on the video at the top of the page!
