So, just how large is a Brahma chicken? Well, my friends, allow me to direct your eyes to the above video uploaded to YouTube over the weekend, featuring a male rooster Brahma emerging from a hen house — with the following actual description presented without commentary, thanks to Google Translate .\nGoogle Translate\nWhen the rooster first pokes its head out, you have to wonder, okay, how big could this thing really be. And then it just keeps spilling out and spilling out until it stands tall at — I don’t know — two feet? Three feet? Either way it looks like you could put a saddle on the thing and ride it like a dang Tauntaun from Star Wars . According to Wikipedia , Brahma roosters can weigh up to 18 pounds, but I would be surprised if this beast is anything less than 25.\nOnce the giant chicken started making the rounds on Reddit and Twitter, people very justifiably started freaking out, because look at that frigging thing .\n\nMe after seeing that video of that giant ass chicken pic.twitter.com/3thzRBSlzf \n— rosa (@RosaCarryon) March 20, 2017 \nI'm really uncomfortable going to bed knowing that giant chicken is out there somewhere.\n— Book Jockey (@AngelaLovesNY) March 20, 2017 \ngood morning to everyone except the giant chicken.\n— Rosaleen (@olenskae) March 20, 2017 \ni will fight that giant chicken\n— BISCUITS (@BlSCUlTS) March 19, 2017 \nThe way this giant chicken walks around makes me believe the whole \"t-rex devolved into the chicken\" theory https://t.co/wfOSBNvTMQ \n— Supreme Court (@AppletonPapi) March 19, 2017 \nThis is worse than we could've imagined pic.twitter.com/jcGTc1Qr6A \n— alex ↙️ (@alexsleepwalks) March 20, 2017 \n\n\nYooo seriously wtf is that giant chicken bird from that video of it coming out of its cage.
