(Source: Twitter) \nNarendra Modi Mann ki Baat: In his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Sunday Prime Minister Modi addressed the nation and apart from congratulating Bangladesh on its Independence Day and highlighting role of Rabindranath Tagore in its national anthem (it was penned by him in 1905) and supreme sacrifice of martyrs Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. The PM also discussed the centenary year of Champaran Satyagrah and said it showed the people how special Mahatma Gandhi was and how unique his personality, as well as his contributions, were. Like in earlier editions of Mann Ki Baat, the PM discussed certain issues that were of crucial importance for him as the country’s very future depended on them. These issues were highlighted in a very hard-hitting manner – PM is generally very reticent and unwilling to show he is agitated by anything that is going on around him and this show of emotion, bordering on anger, is unusual and noteworthy. PM Modi spoke with feeling about cleanliness and also appreciated the efforts of people for supporting the various causes he has highlighted. Food waste and depression were other concerns of the PM on the day. Concluding the address, he invited suggestions of common people for the third International day of Yoga emphasising its benefits for depression and other problems. Here are the quotes of PM Narendra Modi in his Mann ki Baat where he has spoken with strong feeling: \nWATCH: PM Narendra Modi’s 30th ‘Mann Ki Baat’ \n1. “People of India are beginning to get very angry as far as dirt is concerned. This anger towards dirt will propel citizens to undertake some or the other efforts towards cleanliness. These feelings are reflected whenever I ask for ideas and suggestions for Mann Ki Baat – one theme I keep getting suggestions is Swachhata (cleanliness).” \n2. “Wastage of food is unfortunate. It is an injustice against the poor. Wasting food less leads to saving of resources. I know of several youngsters who are using technology and helping prevent wastage of food.” \n3. “Note ban has been accepted by the people. They have taken strong stance against corruption and black money . Also, from the last few months, there is a movement towards increased digital payments, particularly after demonetisation. Its been 2-2.5 months since BHIM app was launched and over 1.5 crore people have downloaded the app.” \n4. “Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were not scared of death. They lived and died for our nation. Their sacrifice must be remembered and 125 cr Indians are now building an India whose vision was laid by our freedom icons.” \n5. “Suppression of depression is not good. Expression is always good. If depressed, share your feelings with others, it will make you feel better.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T10:49:50.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
