Trump had chosen to serve as director of strategic communications for the National Security Council, has decided not to take the job following allegations that she had plagiarized parts of a book and her doctoral dissertation. \n“After much reflection I have decided to remain in New York to pursue other opportunities and will not be taking a position in the incoming administration,” Ms. Crowley said in a written statement to The Washington Times. “I greatly appreciate being asked to be part of President-elect Trump’s team, and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal.” \nCNN reported this month that Ms. Crowley had plagiarized multiple passages in her 2012 book, What the (Bleep) Just Happened? Politico later found multiple instances of plagiarism in her 2000 dissertation at Columbia University. This entry was posted in Government , People . Bookmark the permalink .
