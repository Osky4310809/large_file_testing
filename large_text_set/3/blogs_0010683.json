The three estate planning secrets below will help investors stay on the right path. (For more, see: Estate Planning: Introduction .) Avoid Disinheriting Children \nIf you have children from a previous marriage and intend to pass your assets on to them, be very careful what route you take. Though investors might not want to hear it, in many cases, the stepmother or stepfather will end up with full control of assets and then pass them down to their own children from a previous marriage or new spouse. \nTo prevent that from happening, use a living trust instead of a beneficiary designation or joint ownership. If the living trust is well drafted, it will ensure that your children receive their inheritance. (For more, see: An Estate Planning Must: Update Your Beneficiaries .) Divorce Inheritance Protection \nIf you have a six-year-old child, then you’re not going to be very concerned with that child getting divorced at some point down the road. However, it’s never too early to start planning, and the divorce rate is currently around 50% in the United States. \nIf you don’t take the correct actions, your child’s inheritance could end up in the hands of his or her ex. This is surely not what you have in mind for an inheritance, especially if your child is currently married and you’re not fond of the spouse. The solution is a specially designed trust. \nBy taking this approach, trust shares are created for your child when you pass. Every share will remain in the trust name, which will allow the trustee to be in charge of those shares. As a trustee, the child can invest or spend the income earned by the trust. An added bonus is protection from creditors and bankruptcy. (For more, see: 5 Ways to Mess Up Estate Planning .) Trust Beats Probate \nNotice that trust has been the key word opposed to will. If your estate is planned around a will, then it must go through probate , which involves fees, taxes, and legal costs. To avoid probate, you can use a living trust . \nThere will be costs associated with taking this approach, but these costs will be much less than going through probate. It’s also faster and avoids forking over money to estate planning lawyers who may have ill intentions — some of whom have made their fortunes by probating their clients’ estates when their clients die. These estate planning lawyers will not promote trusts because it wouldn’t be as beneficial for them from a financial standpoint. (For more, see: Estate Planning: 16 Things to Do Before You Die .) \nAn important note is that having a living trust doesn’t guarantee that you will avoid probate. In order to avoid probate, all assets must be titled in your name. This includes bank accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. (For more, see: 6 Ways to Lose Your Estate .) The Bottom Line \nIf estate planning is on your mind, then keep it in your mind and not in your heart. Make the correct decisions for your heirs by protecting your assets. The key theme here is trust over will. \nIf you have the right attorney, this should help avoid disinheritance while offering divorce inheritance protection. It will also help to avoid probate costs.
