The students, Kasra Dabeshlim DMD AS18, Kushal Zinzuvadia DMD AS DMD 18 and Heidar Zohrehei DMD AS DMD 17, presented their poster, “Salivary Biomarkers in Periodontal Diseases- A Systematic Review.” \nThe students completed their research under the mentorship of Dr. Judith Jones. They investigated the association between salivary biomarkers and periodontal disease in a systematic review of over 750 studies found on PubMed, a repository of life science journals and online books. They narrowed the results down to 73 studies by excluding those not available in English, studies in children, studies in animals, and abstracts that were limited or irrelevant. From these narrowed results, the top biomarkers in saliva associated with periodontal disease were assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Their research concluded that the most commonly associated biomarkers were IL1 beta, MMP-8, TNF alpha, IL-6, 8-OHdG, LDH, AST and ICTP. \nThe North American Saliva Symposium is an event for salivary researchers and industry experts to share knowledge and work to further salivary technology which will benefit human health. The symposium is focused on salivary biomarkers and the latest methods and devices to help dentists and physicians. Sessions cover dentistry, medicine, pediatrics, industry, and other disciplines.
