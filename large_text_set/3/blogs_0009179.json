Share this video Get celebs     \nBuffy The Vampire Slayer changed television. \nIt was the first show of its kind and kick-started a worldwide obsession with romanticising vampires. \nFor once, the pretty girl wasn't running away from the monsters or being saved by a man - she was the hero! \nIts star Sarah Michelle Gellar has paid tribute to fans on the 20th anniversary of the hit show. \nFriday marks 20 years since the cult classic aired on TV for the first time and Sarah Michelle, who played the titular character Buffy Summers, took to her Instagram account to thank creator Joss Whedon, a number of her co-stars and the show's fans.

It was a long and challenging road to get there. First the movie, then a passed over pilot presentation, and eventually a mid season time slot on a little known network. \n\"That first season, we liked to think of ourselves as the little show that could. While we knew the potential, I don’t think any of us saw the lasting impact our show would have. As an actor, you wish for that one role where you can leave your mark and forever be remembered, with Buffy I got so much more. \n\"She’s a feminist challenge to gender hierarchy. Buffy may have been the Chosen One, but I was the lucky one. Buffy and Angel were the ultimate human-vampire couple \n\"Thank you to Gail Berman for always believing there was a show in that movie. Thank you to Joss Whedon, for trusting me to give life to one of the greatest female characters ever created. Thank you to David, for always being my Angel. Thank you to James for understanding that while Buffy and Spike may have been love/hate, I have nothing but love for you. Alyson, as any woman knows, you are nothing without the love and support of great female friends, so thank you for being that. Michelle, you will always hold a key to my heart. Thank you to all the incredible actors for seven seasons of amazing performances. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible crew that worked tirelessly (and also really tired) to bring this show to life. \n\"And lastly, but most importantly thank you to all of you, the fans. We made this show for you, and your unwavering support has kept this show going long past our seven years. You are everything. And always remember...\"if the apocalypse comes, beep me\" #buffyslays20 (sic).\" \nSarah Michelle, 39, also took to Twitter to celebrate her \"birthday\", writing: \"Let's party like it's my birthday #buffyslays20 (sic).\" \nTo mark the anniversary, here are 12 things you probably didn't know about Buffy: \nSpike's coat James Marsters as Spike (Photo: Rex Features) \nThe iconic floor-length leather jacket sported by Spike cost the producers $2,000 - and was promptly put on the ground for a truck to run over multiple times to give it that battered look. \nThe mystery executive Dolly Parton was involved in the show (Photo: Getty) \nThough she was never credited at the end of each episode, Dolly Parton was one of the executive producers of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. What a way to make a living. \nWeird graves Sp ky (Photo: Fox TV) \nWhile all the books in the Sunnydale High school library were real, the huge cemetery was actually made... of Styrofoam. \nThe star who never was Imagine what Ryan would have been like as Xander?

With a twist; he was fed up of always seeing the blonde lead as weak and helpless, and made sure his own female protagonist would have more power. \nVampire skincare Maybe she's born with it? (Photo: Rex Features) \n1990s computer graphics don't come cheap - it cost the show $5,000 a pop to 'dust' a vampire with special effects. Each of the actors playing vampires needed six layers of makeup and special contact lenses. \nTeenage dreams Mercedes was the baby of the show (Photo: Fox TV) \nMercedes McNab, who played Harmony when the series started filming in 1996, was the youngest member of the cast at 16. Her co-star Sarah was 19. \nToo buff-y? Nicolas Brendon as Xander (Photo: Fox TV) \nNicholas Brendon had to be warned by producers to stop working out because they didn't want his character Xander looking too buff. According to Nicholas, the reason why Xander got so many good lines was because Joss Whedon based the character on himself. \nLaugh? She'd rather cry Ending demons: not a laughing matter (Photo: Rex Features) \nSarah Michelle Gellar would tell writer David Fury to stop penning scenes in which Buffy laughs, because she hated watching herself faking laughter. In response, David would write as many comical scenes as he could to tease her.
