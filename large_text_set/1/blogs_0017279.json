I think he's playing CEO with America with his billionaire cabinet appointments which concerns me (America is not a corporation in that the President and cabinet work for us, not vice-versa, which is not a concept I think these guys understand), but he keeps saying the right stuff. I pay more attention to actions than words and I don't like his actions so far, but I'm continuing to give him the benefit of the doubt. WestVillageIdiot LetThemEatRand Jan 20, 2017 9:35 PM \nUnfortunately, we all know the alternative was to have Hillary Milhouse Clinton running us to World War III at a full, fucking sprint. Hillary set the bar on the ground. Trump doesn't have to do much to walk over said bar. \nBy the way, fuck you Obama. Take all of that guilt you love to throw at us and shove it up your 19th hole. WestVillageIdiot Disc Jockey Jan 20, 2017 9:33 PM \nThe transformation of LetThemEatRand the past two years makes the story of Lazarus look like a freaking everyday occurrence. The blind will see. The lame will walk. And LetThemEatRand will be a Donald Trump supporter. I can believe the line about the blind, but I never would have believed the line about LTER. I can only imagine what tomorrow brings. I will probably wake up tomorrow as the Duke of Windsor. \nHill's pissed Ivanka looked back at Bill, not her. \nNormalcy Bias Dutes Jan 20, 2017 9:26 PM \nI saw a hilarious tabloid cover in the supermarket stating that Bill was going to sell Hillary out and she was going to go to prison. \nIf only, \"The Greediest White Trash\" in America has far too much dirt on one another for that. Perhaps one may Arkancide the other, who knows... \n\nThat's what I said to people who weren't exactly thrilled about today. \n\"Imagine how depressing it would be if Hillary Clinton was being sworn in?\" \nThat seemed to make them feel much better...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T04:41:57.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
