In episode 14 Alejandro is shown criticizing Setsuna's intervention in Azadistan branding him as a martyr. During Operation Fallen Angels, it was Alejandro who engaged Setsuna with the mobile armor Alvatore ; but Setsuna finally managed to defeat him. Azadistan Edit \nMain article: Kingdom of Azadistan When the Republic of Krugis was still an independent nation, Azadistan started a war with their neighboring Middle Eastern country. Azadistan was better equipped in weapons and eventually the Republic of Krugis was destroyed and forcefully merged with Azadistan. While people of Kurdish descent were granted citizenship in Azadistan, they weren't welcomed by the Azadistan locals. Setsuna has mixed feelings when it comes to Azadistan's past actions against the Republic of Krugis due to the painful deaths in his life. Marina Ismail \nMarina met Setsuna by chance because she thought she was helping out a fellow Azadistan countryman during her diplomatic mission in Scotland. To her mistake she helped out citizen that was formally part of the Republic of Krugis, making their later conversation awkward. This conversation did not end up well; Setsuna revealed his code name identity as a Gundam Meister and warned her Celestial Being would come if conflict continues there. However Marina never revealed this information. \nThough not true friends at the beginning, Setsuna held respect for her as a person trying to find peace and solutions to Azadistan 's development issues, walking a path different than his. During Setsuna's return to Azadistan, he helped her restore peace by rescuing their conservative leader, Massoud Rachmadi in a heroic non-confrontation mission. He returned not long some other day in the middle of the night, asking her questions about the lesser aspects of humanity, questions like \"why is the world distorted, misguided (or twisted, depending on translation). Before he sortied on his final mission, he wrote a letter to her. Marina was genuinely concerned and was touched by Setsuna's possibly post death letter. \nIn season 2, after Setsuna had rescued Marina and taken her back to Ptolemy, Mileina Vashti asked if she and Setsuna were lovers but both, without any hesitation or embarrassment, denied it. After apologizing for drawing her into trouble, Setsuna and Marina grow considerably closer. They now constantly debate and talk about war and peace. Marina even asked if Setsuna wanted to join her to rebuild Azadistan, but he refused saying that he could do no more than fighting. Marina was genuinely saddened for Setsuna's sad and tragic lifestyle. \nSetsuna later entrusts Marina Ismail to Katharon's care. After some time they meet once again when Setsuna came back injured from the battle with Ali al-Saachez. After receiving medical treatment and after waking up from recovery, they share an intimate moment in which they talk about themselves and their lives. Marina implores Setsuna to find the way of changing the world without fighting (the way Setsuna said he had been looking along with his Gundam in his letter) The mood in the room gets so close and intimate that Katharon's orphan children go out embarrassed saying that Setsuna and Marina got \"lovey-dovey\" . Before parting ways once more, Setsuna said that when they meet again he wants to hear the children sing Marina's song, at which she replied that Setsuna had to take care of himself. \nTwo years after the defeat of A-Laws and the Innovators, Setsuna saved Marina from an assassination attempt by the Union Corporation However, he chooses not to see her as Setsuna didn't think it was necessary. After Setsuna makes peace with the ELS, Marina sees the desert flower in space (native to Azadistan) and said that it represented Setsuna's hopes and wishes for the world. 50 years after the ELS conflict, Setsuna returned to Earth to see Marina, with both of them telling each other that they could finally understand each other. Rasa Massoud Rachmadi \nHe is a leader to the conservatives and the opposition in Azadistan. He acts as a deterrence of war in Azadistan. Setsuna brought him back from the clutches of Ali al-Saachez. He flew in with Exia, un-armed, and in good faith returned Rachmadi, who was deeply thankful towards him. Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations Edit \nMain article: Union of Solar Energy and Free Nations Setsuna stayed in Japan in between his missions in Season 1. It is not revealed if Setsuna chose Japan as his home base of operations or Celestial Being designated it for strategic purposes. Setsuna lives there alone in a single apartment with no more than a simple bed where he often reflects or exercises until the next mission. It is hinted that Soran was given a Japanese code name by Celestial Being so he would fit better in there. Saji Crossroad \nHe is Setsuna's next door neighbor, and he is ignorant to Setsuna's true identity until four years later. From the beginning Saji tried to be nice and polite towards Setsuna, but he was soon disappointed to find out his cold and taciturn personality. However he keeps trying to reach Setsuna and more than one time he tries to establish a relationship with him. The two of them lost contact during the five years interlude between seasons. \nAfter being rescued by Setsuna in Proud Colony and after having learned his real identity, he vents that Setsuna destroyed everything he held dear and asks why he still fights. Setsuna says he has his reasons and doesn't care if Saji hates him. After the Katharon base incident, Saji tries to make up to his sins by piloting the 0 Raiser. After Saji becomes the pilot of the 0 Raiser, Setsuna convinces Saji to fight in order to save Louise from the grip of the Innovators . \nAt the end of Season 2, Saji was fully understanding about Celestial Being actions and the circumstances around Setsuna; so he became more considerate and understanding towards him. In one scene, after being moved by Setsuna's selfless acting and determination, Saji even thanked him because he felt he had to do it. When the Trans-Am Burst system was activated during the Lagrange 2 battle, Saji had no doubt that the \"pure and warm light \" was the light from Setsuna's heart, the light that would lead humanity to a better future. Graham Aker \nGraham was among the first characters to behold a Celestial Being intervention. From the very beginning Graham was awed by Setsuna/Exia's outstanding performance. This admiration soon evolved into obsession, as Graham started making constant exertions to face and defeat Gundam Exia. When Graham first met Setsuna in person (during the Azadistan incident) Graham had spotted him eavesdropping his conversation with Billy Katagiri. Graham immediately noticed that Setsuna was not a common guy; and he even leaked some information under this suspicions. \nHis obsession soon reached the point where he claimed that his towards Gundam feeling was love . This obsession worsened when his comrades were killed, this is when his feeling became hatred. At his final confrontation with Setsuna/Exia, Graham confirmed that Setsuna was not a common guy indeed. At this final confrontation Graham stated that it was destiny what linked him to Setsuna. \nAfter becoming Mr. Bushido he became one of Setsuna's greatest foes in season 2. He found the determination to defeat Setsuna in honorable battle. Mr. Bushido was even given a special license which authorized him to do as he pleased (just like a one-man-army) and he took this as an advantage to face 00 Gundam every time he could. \nHe finally lost his final battle against Setsuna; and he was about to suicide (according to what Bushido stated). However he hesitated when remembering Setsuna's final words to him: \"I will fight to live on\" . At the end he did not hate or despise Setsuna and called his fate link with him as an unavoidable destiny . \nLater on in the ELS conflict, Graham rushed into the battle once more to save Celestial Being's Gundam team, his arrival didn't prevent the ELS from assimilating the ESF fleet or save Tieria Erde's physical form, but it did allow CB to retrieve an unconscious Setsuna. After he was transferred to the ship, Graham paid him a visit and noted how Setsuna attempted to seek a path for understanding with a race as enigmatic as the ELS, Feldt Grace asked his identity, but he simply answered with \"a man who foolishly attempted to surpass the Gundams; when it was this boy the one I needed to surpass.\" \nGraham also took part in the battle at the Absolute Line of Defense, catching up to a hesitant Setsuna during the battle and saying that it was him who told Graham that he should fight to live on, even if it was a contradiction. And finally showed the last act of redemption when he helped Setsuna in breaking through the ELS planetoid, having left every vendetta behind them as he slipped through the regenerating planetoid's surface and self-destructed his Brave, giving Setsuna the opportunity he sought to communicate with the ELS.
