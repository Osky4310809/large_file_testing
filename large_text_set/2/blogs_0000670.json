Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The family members were aware of the order when they landed and were relieved that they had made it in time. “Thank God — because we couldn’t believe that,” said Masumbuko, 38, standing in Terminal 4 with his wife, Roza; his two daughters, Nathalie, 20, and Kwizi, who turns 13 on Wednesday; and their 8-year-old son, Leo. “We are so happy.” Church World Service, which was resettling the family, asked that their last name not be published because of fears for the family’s safety. \n  The family was heading north to the Hudson Valley, where Christ Episcopal Church and Vassar College — both in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. — had arranged for their resettlement. Despite support from 1,200 volunteers from 30 organizations, Vassar Temple, Masjid al-Noor Mosque and seven local colleges, a protest and death threat surfaced online. Still, there were only smiles, hugs and shouts of welcome when the volunteers from Christ Church met the family at the Stewart International Airport parking lot near Newburgh, N.Y. “It’s a testimony to all the people in the church and in the community who made this happen,” said the Rev. Susan Fortunato. “Quite honestly, if I can take a small professional stand, it was a little faith and maybe divine intervention that made sure that these folks could get in before the borders were closed for refugees.” The trip from Kennedy Airport was subdued, as if the passing landscape in white and gray made the trip that much more surreal. The van was provided by the International Organization for Migration. The driver, Jimmy Yu, immigrated to the United States from Hong Kong in 1991.

Masu was a nurse who routinely delivered babies — including twins, three times. Roza worked sewing clothes. Masu said their first interview to get to the United States was in March 2011, when they registered as refugees. They had more interviews, including screening by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in 2014, interviews with immigration officers of the United States, and health and final security clearances. They were approved for relocation in October 2016. From then, they had cultural orientation sessions in Malawi, as they prepared to embark to their new home.
