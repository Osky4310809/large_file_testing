Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA rare Jane Austen fiver worth £50,000 has been handed to charity by an anonymous donor. \nThe woman, known only as “J” gave the note away to “help young people” because she doesn’t “need it at my time of life\". \nIt was posted to the Scottish gallery where it was created with in conjunction with Birmingham micro-artist Graham Short. \nJust four notes were specially engraved with a portrait of Jane Austen and spent in each of the home countries. \nThe first was found in a café in south Wales in December, with the second discovery coming in Scotland inside a Christmas card the same month. \nBut the third was discovered in Northern Ireland by the woman who posted it back to the Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, in Kelso, Scotland with a note which read: “£5 note enclosed, I don’t need it at my time of life. Please use it to help young people.” Read More Is your fiver worth £50,000? Third rare Jane Austen note found leaving one remaining in circulation in England The Jane Austen portrait (Photo: SWNS) \nAccording to the gallery, the woman got in touch in mid-January to tell them she had found the note while visiting Enniskillen in County Fermanagh. \nMichael Huggins, the gallery’s assistant manager, said the woman then asked for a couple of weeks to “mull over” what she might do with it. \nHe added: “Then we received this note in the mail along with the fiver. The note just said she wanted it to be used to help young people.” \nHe described her voice as “soft” and “older” and said: “With that and the note when she refers to her age, we think it’s an older woman. But, all we know is that she is from County Donegal and that she wants the money to go to benefit young people.” \nIt is thought the note will now be auctioned off in aid of Children in Need. \nEngland is now the only area yet to discover a Jane Austen note.
