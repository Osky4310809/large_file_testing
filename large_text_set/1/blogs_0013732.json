I have nothing to regret about this video \nIn Egypt, videos of women dancing and having sex have been published on social media by their ex boyfriends. Now they are speaking out to challenge a society that judges female sexuality Uploading private videos and creating fake social media accounts can be damaging. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA Supported by   10.53 GMT Last modified on   10.54   Close \nS ix years since the uprising, women in Egypt are still fighting for our rights. \nOur bodies are controlled by wider society in both public and private spaces. “Honour” is still judged to rest upon women’s conduct and sexual activity. So we are inhibited from publicly expressing our sexuality and bodily autonomy. This context means that a woman’s private life can be used against her if someone threatens to make it public. The online world is now a battlefield for women struggling for their right to privacy. \nI have suffered the wounds of this battle. In 2009, I sent a private video of me dancing to my then boyfriend, who threatened to post it online after we broke up. In 2013, a friend told me he had seen me dancing on YouTube. I was furious, realising that my ex-boyfriend had uploaded it. I reported him. My ex-boyfriend was convicted and sentenced to a year in jail, but I didn’t pursue the case, satisfied he was punished enough. What working as an FGM counsellor taught me about female sexuality Read more \nThe blackmailing didn’t end there. The video remained on YouTube and cyber bullies used it to target me as a feminist activist. I decided to take the matter into my own hands by posting the video on Facebook myself . I wrote: “My body is not a source of shame. I have nothing to regret about this video.” \nRecently Sahar (she doesn’t want her last name published), an Egyptian woman and mother of two, was targeted with online shame when her ex-boyfriend posted nude photos of her on social media. Soon after they broke up on New Year’s Eve in 2015, her horrified daughter showed her a fake Facebook account with Sahar’s name, photos and advertisements for prostitution. They were sent to her children and other family members. \n“I will never forget the moment I saw myself naked on social media, with my real address and phone number, targeted by revenge porn,” she says. “I recognised that it was cropped from a video of us having sex, hiding his face. Ironically, he recorded this clip using a cellphone that I gave him for his birthday.” \nMale strangers started to visit Sahar at home to ask for sex. She contacted The Girls’ Revolution , an Egyptian feminist platform I founded that supports women’s bodily rights. I believe that a woman has authority over her own body; no-one has the right to violate​​ or humiliate it \nShe then reported her ex-boyfriend to the police, accusing him of defamation. “It was not easy,” she says. “I had to publicly show my naked photos to be included into the official report. I knew that every officer at the police station could have seen my intimate moments shown in these photos, but I had no choice.” Her ex contacted her saying that he would delete the account if she gave him 45,000 Egyptian pounds (£2,000) and cancelled the police report. \nSahar told him to stop intimidating her. “Every time I thought about retreating, I remembered that horrific look on my daughter’s face seeing that fake profile,” she says. In December 2016, her ex was officially sentenced to two years in jail. Sahar has no regrets. “I believe that a woman has authority over her own body; no-one has the right to violate or humiliate it.” \nAlthough my blackmailer and Sahar’s were convicted of defamation, our stories show the lack of a specialised law for cybercrimes in Egypt. According to article 11 of the Egyptian constitution (2014), the state shall protect women against all forms of violence, whereas cybercrimes against women are classified as “defamation” crimes. That suggests that a woman’s private life is shameful, and doesn’t recognise it as a gender-based crime of violence. UN Women defines “cyber violence” as online threats and harassment, which Sahar and I both experienced. \nFacebook and YouTube privacy policies should also consider a specific reporting rationale for gender-related cybercrimes in order to secure women’s online safety. For instance, Facebook community standards do not make it easy for fake accounts to be removed, unless nude photos are posted, and not photos posted for defamation. YouTube follows the same policy, however its reporting procedures are not always successful. Hundreds of Arab women’s private videos are still uploaded to YouTube tagged as “hot”, including mine. \nCyber blackmailing and online shaming are being experienced by women around the world; however, they are hard to fight against in societies like Egypt where women are criticised for as little as dancing in public. Fighting against this in solidarity requires a sensitive conversation that supports our rights and does not accept violations as part of non-western culture. They need to be vocally condemned. \nJoin our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter.
