It will also allow the hunting of wolves and bears in or around their own dens. \nJamie Rappaport Clark, President and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife explains : \"Is running roughshod over public lands and targeting mother bears and wolves and their young on lands specifically set aside as wildlife refuges really a priority for legislators given the many challenges facing our country? Americans expect our national wildlife refuges to be managed for their conservation values of all wildlife, not just those species of a particular interest to a few&rdquo; \nThis brutal resolution will allow hunters to kill wildlife families within their own homes. \nPlease sign to oppose cruel House Resolution 69 and help save wildlife! \nI strongly urge you to stand up for Alaskan Wildlife and oppose House Resolution 69. This is a cruel act that will threaten wildlife families within their own homes. \n[Your comments here]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T09:19:37.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
