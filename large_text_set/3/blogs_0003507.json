If one wears a blue gingham dress, the other will wear a blue checkered shirt. If one wears a Tartan overcoat with a fair isle sweater, the other will compliment the outfit with a slightly different colored fair isle sweater and matching Tartan kilt. The two tend to stick to a neutral palette of black, white and gray, shot with bright red or blue, or enlivened with plaid or polka dots. And they deftly mix avant-garde labels like Comme des Garcons with basics from Uniqlo as well as vintage finds.\n赤🔴を差し色に #couple #over60 #fashion #coordinate #outfit #ootd #instafashion #instaoutfit #instagramjapan #whitehair #silverhair #greyhair #夫婦 #60代 #ファッション #コーディネート #夫婦コーデ #今日のコーデ #グレイヘア #白髪 #共白髪 \nA post shared by bon_pon (@bonpon511) on Feb 12, 2017 at 12:17am PST \nBut it’s not just their meticulous ensembles that attract fans. The pair clearly have a sweet whimsy that comes through in their photos, which often depict them posing in rabbit-eared hats or next to unicorn sculptures.\n“You guys are such an inspiration,” wrote one commenter . “I love it; you both have probably so much fun.”\nミッフィー展にて #couple #over60 #fashion #coordinate #outfit #ootd #instafashion #instaoutfit #instagramjapan #whitehair #silverhair #greyhair #夫婦 #60代 #ファッション #コーディネート #グレイヘア #白髪 #共白髪 \nA post shared by bon_pon (@bonpon511) on Dec 4, 2016 at 5:17am PST \n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:56:15.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
