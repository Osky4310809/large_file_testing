Henninger/Post-Gazette Art Rooney Jr. developed many NFL scouts in his role as Steelers player personnel chief in the 1960s through '80s. By Ed Bouchette   \nThe gathering at the NFL’s Scouting Combine this week in Indianapolis will include a reunion of sorts, as it always does. \nScouts and player personnel men from Western Pennsylvania have a special bond and there are quite a few of them. You’ve heard of coaching trees? Bill Walsh had one, Chuck Noll had one, Don Shula had one — head coaches who spawned other head coaches. \nThis then would be a scouting tree, with Art Rooney Jr., Dan Rooney’s brother, the head of it. He was the Steelers’ player personnel chief in the 1960s through the first half of the 1980s, famously helping to build their dynasty of the ‘70s through the draft. He had a summer program during that time that led to the development of many NFL scouts, player personnel executives and general managers throughout the NFL from Western Pennsylvania. \n“It all traces back to Art Rooney Jr.,” said Kevin Colbert, the Steelers general manager. \nRooney (North Catholic High School), employed local high school coaches in the summer to grade NFL players from other teams on film for the Steelers. Based on their reports, he often would recommend the best of them to Jack Butler, the Steelers Hall of Fame cornerback who ran the Blesto scouting service out of his native Pittsburgh. \nButler hired some to work for Blesto as scouts and many went on to join other NFL teams as scouts, some rising to higher positions with teams. \n“Once you started getting guys in the business, that would bring in more guys who may have worked for or played for those people who Jack Butler hired,” Colbert said. \nThat’s how Colbert got into the business. His North Catholic High School coach, Ron Hughes, worked in the summer for Rooney, then was hired by Butler. Hughes went to work in the NFL, and was longtime director of player personnel for the Detroit Lions. He recommended Colbert to Butler and another career in scouting began. \nNot every scout and personnel executive in the NFL came through that program, but that is where the seeds were sewn. \n“Really, it all goes back to Art hiring the high school coaches who then were recommended to Jack Butler, who then hired people that they knew,” Colbert said. \nAmong others who went through Rooney’s summer program were Tom Donahoe (South Catholic), Tom Modrak (Carrick), the Bushofsky brothers, Joe and Jack (North Catholic) and Chuck Connor, (Pittsburgh native and former Montour coach). All became team GMs, presidents or personnel executives after starting off as scouts. \nLegendary scout Bill Nunn (Westinghouse High) worked part-time for the Steelers while sports editor of the Pittsburgh Courier and eventually joined them full time. Tim Rooney (North Catholic) was the pro scout for the Steelers and then worked for the Lions and Giants. Dick Haley (Midway) was a personnel director with the Steelers and New York Jets. Ken Herock (Munhall) was a player personnel executive for several teams, including the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons. His son, Shaun, born in Pittsburgh, is the Oakland Raiders’ director of college scouting. \n“Beyond what Art did, football in Western Pennsylvania is a big part of the fabric of this region,” Colbert said. \nThe NFL remains home to a gaggle of Western Pennsylvanians who became scouts or personnel executives. \nAmong them: \nDoug Whaley (Upper St. Clair), Buffalo Bills GM; Andy Weidl (Mt. Lebanon), Philadelphia Eagles assistant director of player personnel, and his brother Casey Weidl, Eagles college scouting coordinator; Rob McCartney (Mt. Lebanon), Buccaneers director of pro scouting; John Wojciechowski (Plum), Green Bay Packers scout; Luke Palko (West Allegheny) and Mike Boni (Moon), Arizona Cardinals scouts; Chad Henry (Indiana), Indianapolis Colts scout; Tim Gribble (Uniontown), Washington Redskins scout and Matthew Donahoe (Mt. Lebanon native), Kansas City Chiefs scout. \nThe Steelers player personnel staff is packed with Western Pennsylvania natives. \nThey include Kevin Colbert’s son Dan (Mars) and Jack Butler’s son Mike, both scouts. Others are Dan Rooney Jr. (Mt. Lebanon native), player personnel coordinator; Brandon Hunt (Pine-Richland), pro scouting coordinator; Mark Gorscak (Ringgold), scout; and Dave Petett (Shady Side Academy), scout. \nMany of those began their careers as scouting interns with the Steelers, among them Dan Colbert, Hunt, Petett, Weidl, Wojciechowski, Palko, McCartney and Gribble. \n“Everybody who has been in our program, going back to when Art began the internship here, has gotten a full-time job in the NFL either as a coach or scout,” Kevin Colbert said. \nThose interns gather for an annual reunion during this week’s combine in Indianapolis, celebrating a tree that began 50 years ago and continues to flourish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:04:56.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
