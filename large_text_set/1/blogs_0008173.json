In 2014, Ramiro visited India on holiday and hung out with Arjun, whom he had shared the stage with at shows across the world before. \nVagale recalls, “We spent time at my home in Goa, cooking together – that’s when the idea of the label began. We kept it on the backburner, but earlier last year, we began discussing the idea again, and decided it was the right time to get it going.” DJ Ramiro Lopez \nNow joining the producer’s family of OddShop (which hawks some seriously good gear/wares for the audio tech geek) and radio show Oddcast is Odd Recordings, a record label that’s “not-of-the-norm and free of rules”. \nTheir inaugural release is a made-for-dance floors techno EP called We Are Odd and will release on January 20, featuring two tracks Oddball and Even Flow. \nVagale adds, “We wanted to present the first EP, which is a collaboration between Ramiro and myself, to be a bold statement of intent for the label. Over the years both our sounds have evolved, and for the label, we wanted to do something radically 'odd', but instead of trying to complicate things, we stripped it back to the basics--powerful drums with weird synths. The result has been pretty well received on every dance-floor we've played the tracks to!” \nIn the age of surprise album drops and independent artists who have a direct channel of communication with listeners, Vagale and Ramiro set up a record label as an extension of their brand and sound. \nHe explains, “In many ways, it is your home to release your own music, which is what we are doing. Odd Recordings will be a small family of artists, collaborating together and pushing the sound we personally love.” \nOnce the collaborative EP is out, there’s the first of Odd Parties and Odd Raves, which will take place in March, when Vagale and Ramiro take the decks together. \nVagale adds, “We then head to Europe for Sonar, where we will be doing an Odd label showcase.” \n2017 sure looks odd and wonderful. \nFeatured Image Courtesy: Unmute", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T16:49:39.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
