Of course, we’re certain that’s not true, considering he’s, you know, human. But still, he appears to be perfection. However, Emma Stone might disagree due to Gosling’s food addiction , which has her very concerned .\nThe addiction? Snacking. The man loves snacks.\nAnd we totally get it. Because snacks.\nEmma dished about her La La Land co-star to Marie Claire , and she uncovered quite the revelation: Gosling hides snacks in his costumes. (So now we obviously love him even more, because that is something WE WOULD TOTALLY DO.)\nThe co-stars have starred in three films together — Crazy Stupid Love , Gangster Squad and La La Land , which would explain why they know a thing or two about each other’s quirks. Stone told Marie Claire, \n“He loves Twizzlers. He used to eat so many on set it was concerning. He had them in his suit pocket.

Which means, you’ll need to carry around a supply of Twizzlers at all times, but it’ll be so worth it, probably.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:07:56.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
