Juicy Couture tracksuits made a high-fashion comeback, thanks to cult-favorite brand Vetements, while “It” girls like the Hadid sisters, Hailey Baldwin, and Kendall Jenner have consistently shown an affinity for some of our favorite early-aughts styles, like Adidas tracksuits, going-out tops, rhinestone chokers, and logo sweatshirts. Considering the current state of fashion, you might even think we’re living in the year 2002 rather than 2017. This past weekend, Jenner made a case for the return of the era's most popular \"It\" bag: The Louis Vuitton Murakami Mini Speedy. Created in 2003 by then creative director Marc Jacobs, the bag featured a multicolored monogram by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. Seen on the arm of every Hollywood starlet spotted on the streets of Rodeo Drive, the bag—and its subsequent line of accessories—became an instant hit and lasted for 12 years until the company discontinued it in July 2015.

The model opted for a mini size—a style that’s been popular with brands like Chloé and Valentino, which both showed baby-size bags on the spring 2017 runways . She also kept the rest of her outfit minimal, wearing a pair of shiny black pants, a white corset tee from her Kendall + Kylie fashion line, a Dion Lee pinstriped blazer, and a pair of white Adidas by Raf Simons Stan Smith sneakers. The mini yet mighty statement bag certainly popped against the monochromatic outfit. Jenner’s look has us feeling nostalgic for some of the other forgotten accessories of the era. Considering that we've recently seen the Balenciaga Motorcycle on the arm of The Row's Mary-Kate Olsen and logo-stamped Gucci bags as reimagined by Alessandro Michele, we wouldn't be surprised if other bags of the past make a comeback soon.
