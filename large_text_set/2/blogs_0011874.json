For me, the organisation in England is fantastic. The last four play the semi-final one game and then the final at Wembley too and it's fantastic for the fans. \nFIFA 17 announce PL upgrades \n\"Every club wants to win the FA Cup, teams not in the top six even more as they can get in the Europa League [if they win it]. So it's a fantastic competition to play in. We want to keep playing in it and win away against Blackburn. \n\"We have very good memories from last season and I'm very optimistic because we have a very good squad.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:01:38.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
