In a letter to Freeman penned exactly ninety days before the release of Silent Spring , as Carson was coming to terms with the irreversible bravery of breaking her silence about the destruction of nature and the government’s attendant heedlessness, she shared a quotation that had bolstered her courage to speak out: \nTo sin by silence, when we should protest makes cowards out of men.\nThe words reached across time to strike me with their extraordinary relevance today, and I set out to find their source. Literature being the original internet, as I’ve long believed, Carson’s letter became a de facto “hyperlink” to another text — the words she cited, though frequently misattributed to Abraham Lincoln, turned out to be the opening lines of a piercing poem titled “Protest” by Ella Wheeler Wilcox (November 5, 1850–October 30, 1919), from her 1914 book Poems of Problems ( public domain | public library ), written at the peak of the Women’s Suffrage movement. \nElla Wheeler Wilcox A mighty and mobilizing anthem against silence, the poem stands as an anthem for our own time. So I asked my friend and fellow poetry-lover Amanda Palmer to record a reading of this timeless, timely masterpiece as an installment in our ongoing collaboration on poetry readings. (Previously: “Humanity i love you” by E.E. Cummings, and “Possibilities” and “Life While-You-Wait” by Polish Nobel laureate Wisława Szymborska.)\nAmanda herself was so moved by the words that she invited her friend Jherek Bischoff — the brilliant composer and multi-instrumentalist with whom she collaborated on their David Bowie tribute — to set the words to music. The piece that buoys the poem is titled “Closer To Closure,” from Jherek’s entrancing album Cistern . Please enjoy:\n\nPROTEST\nTo sin by silence, when we should protest,\nMakes cowards out of men. The human race\nHas climbed on protest. Had no voice been raised\nAgainst injustice, ignorance, and lust,\nThe inquisition yet would serve the law,\nAnd guillotines decide our least disputes.\nThe few who dare, must speak and speak again\nTo right the wrongs of many. Speech, thank God,\nNo vested power in this great day and land\nCan gag or throttle. Press and voice may cry\nLoud disapproval of existing ills;\nMay criticise oppression and condemn\nThe lawlessness of wealth-protecting laws\nThat let the children and childbearers toil\nTo purchase ease for idle millionaires.\nTherefore I do protest against the boast\nOf independence in this mighty land.\nCall no chain strong, which holds one rusted link.\nCall no land free, that holds one fettered slave.\nUntil the manacled slim wrists of babes\nAre loosed to toss in childish sport and glee,\nUntil the mother bears no burden, save\nThe precious one beneath her heart, until\nGod’s soil is rescued from the clutch of greed\nAnd given back to labor, let no man\nCall this the land of freedom.\nI’d be remiss not to mention that Amanda’s music, like my own work, is supported by donations.
