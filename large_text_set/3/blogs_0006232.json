The agent for the 26-year-old running back says his client will visit the Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers the next four days. \n— SportsTrust Advisors (@_SportsTrust) March 9, 2017 \nBut will the free-agent running back receive a long-term contract to his liking after back-to-back down years? Lacy was limited to five games last year with the Packers after suffering an ankle injury in October. He gained 5.1 yards per carry before the injury but didn’t get into the end zone. \nLacy was healthy in 2015 but wasn’t nearly as productive as his first two years in the league. The Packers weren’t happy with his conditioning in 2015, when he rushed for 758 yards and just three touchdowns. Lacy attempted to lose the weight in the offseason, taking conditioning classes that appeared to be working. But the ankle injury derailed his chance to prove he was back in shape. \nIt looked like Lacy was going to be the Packers’ star running back for the foreseeable future when he entered the league in 2013. He rushed for 1,178 yards and 11 touchdowns that season and followed it up with 1,139 rushing yards and nine touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:58:32.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
