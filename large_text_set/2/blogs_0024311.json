This five-year plan will be carried out alongside a media plan that will keep pace with the project’s implementation programme. The media plan will ensure coverage at local, regional and international levels, taking into consideration how well the project was received when it was announced during the World Government Summit 2017. \nHis Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid also instructed MBRSC to introduce a scientific, research and behavioural programme to instil a passion for knowledge in the new generation of students in Emirati schools and universities, in addition to focussing on research programmes that will positively impact high-priority technology sectors, which in turn can benefit the UAE’s march towards development. \nHe also emphasised the importance of inspiring new generations in order to take their ambition to new heights, expand their knowledge and motivate their scientific curiosity, which will serve the UAE’s future plans and will leave an imprint on human knowledge. \nHis Highness Sheikh Mohammed pointed out that sky and space are the limit for the new generations to meet their aspirations. \nThe Mars 2117 project includes putting in place a programme to prepare Emiratis for Mars and space exploration. The project aims to build the first city on Mars in 100 years, which will be achieved through various scientific alliances. The project will be associated with research themes involved in the exploration of faster transportation systems to Mars, as well as building houses and producing energy and food. It will also try to find faster transportation methods for travelling to and from Mars.
