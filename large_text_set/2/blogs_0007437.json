We get along. I don’t know if he’ll admit this, but he likes me,” Trump said. “I like him. I can feel it, you know that’s what I do in life, it’s called, like, I understand. Now, we had a rough campaign, he was fighting better for Hillary than she did. He was vicious during the campaign toward me and I was vicious toward him. We said horrible things about each other” \nLove it. \nThe funny thing is…I kind of agree with Trump on this one. \nI can see Obama secretly respecting Trump. \nIt is a well-known fact that the Obamas and Clintons aren’t very close and the Clintons are apparently still angry at Obama for not doing more to help her win. \nPublicly, Obama has to act offended by Trump. However, if there’s one thing Obama loves and admires it’s fame. Why else do you think he’s always hob-knobbing with celebrities and hanging out on reality TV shows? \nHe loves the spotlight and there’s no bigger spotlight than the one Donald Trump sits in. \nTrump could be way off here but for some reason, this makes sense to me.
