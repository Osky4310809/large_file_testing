Is it a plane? Is today really the 25-year anniversary of Jonty Rhodes ' famous run out of Pakistan's Inzamam-ul-Haq at the 1992 Cricket World Cup? \nAfter Pakistan had won the toss and elected to bowl, South Africa posted 211/7 in their alloted 50 overs at the Gabba in Brisbane. \nDue to rain, Pakistan's revised victory target was 194 in 36 overs for victory. \nCoasting to the win at 135/2, up stepped the world's greatest ever fielder. \nStationed in his customary point position, Rhodes picked up the ball, sprinted towards the stumps and in what can only be described as a Superman-esque dive, demolished all three stumps. \nUl-Haq was stranded centimetres short, out for 48 off 44 balls. \nPakistan would go on to end their innings on 173/8, giving South Africa victory by 20 runs. \nMassive kudos to West Indies umpire Steve Bucknor who was brave enough make the decision. What a gigantic 'non-event' it would have been had he, without the help of the third umpire at the time, given the Pakistani star 'not out'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T16:34:09.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
