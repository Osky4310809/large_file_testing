We are ready to act. San Francisco is the first city to proactively challenge the proposed policy of the administration.”\nGarcetti referred to the Trump administration’s list of jurisdictions that have policies limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a “scarlet letter” that includes almost every city with buildings and running water.\n“The first so-called punishment to so-called sanctuary cities came through a proposal in the budget, which was to stop reimbursements in our mostly county jails but cities have some as well. We’re not affected by this but I think there's a recognition, potentially, from the administration that to try to define or pull out what a sanctuary city is and what one isn’t is going to be a very perilous pathway legally, which is why they just withdrew this funding for all cities,” Garcetti said.\n“So even those cities that this administration would say is adhering to what they want in terms of immigration policies at the local level also saw their funding get cut,” he added. “So I think it’s a very dangerous path for us to start losing funding that helps protect our nation.”\nGarcetti said he does not want to spend his city’s “police resources” on cooperating with federal immigration authorities to deport undocumented immigrants that have not committed serious crimes.\n“We were told in previous administrations that this would be done in a way that only focuses on serious crimes, and when we looked at the detainer requests they were not often focused on any serious crimes. It could be a suspicion of a crime. It could have been somebody who already served their time,” he said on the call.\n“It could be a misdemeanor that became a felony because they didn’t pay a traffic bill. And that’s not where we want to spend our police resource time. And the most important part of this is the court found it unconstitutional to hold somebody longer than the legal requirement under the Constitution, so we feel that what they are asking us to do would violate the Constitution,” he added.\n politics/2017/03/28/l-a-mayor-trumps-sanctuary-city-crackdown-violates-constitution/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ddor/ddor2017_01-28to02-03.pdf"], "published": "2017-03-28T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:27:54.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
