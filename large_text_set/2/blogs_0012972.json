During his show in Paris on Monday night, the Third Man Records head again showed off his impressive musical repertoire with not one, not two, but six different covers worked into his 27-song set. \nWhite worked in the lyrics of The Police’s “Message in a Bottle” to his performance of “Steady As She Goes” and briefly covered Talking Heads’“Psycho Killer” during “Seven Nation Army”. He also tackled Bob Dylan’s “Isis” and Robert Johnson’s “If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day”, two songs which he hasn’t played since his days in The White Stripes. And if that weren’t enough, he tried his hand at Howlin’ Wolf’s “Smokestack Lightning” and Dick Dale’s “Misirlou”. \nWatch a series of fan-shot videos and see the full setlist below. \n“Steady As She Goes” w/ “Message in a Bottle”: \n“Seven Nation Army” w/ “Psycho Killer”: \n“If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day”: \nSetlist: Astro (The White Stripes song) Black Train Smokestack Lightning (Howlin’ Wolf cover) If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day (Robert Johnson cover) High Ball Stepper Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground (The White Stripes song) Temporary Ground Hotel Yorba (The White Stripes song) Isis (Bob Dylan cover) Top Yourself (The Raconteurs song) I’m Slowly Turning Into You (The White Stripes song) Just One Drink The Same Boy You’ve Always Known (The White Stripes song) Cannon (The White Stripes song) Icky Thump (The White Stripes song) Misirlou (Dick Dale cover) \nEncore: Lazaretto You Don’t Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You’re Told) (The White Stripes song) Steady, As She Goes (The Raconteurs song) / “Message in a Bottle” (The Police cover) Hypocritical Kiss Suzy Lee (The White Stripes song) Lafayette Blues (The White Stripes song) Seven Nation Army / “Psycho Killer” (Talking Heads cover) Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:44:48.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
