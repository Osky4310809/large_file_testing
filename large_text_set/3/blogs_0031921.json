Asiwaju Bola Tinubu \nAccording to the party, “whether you like or hate Tinubu, or you are his ardent admirer or critic, nobody can remove from the fact that in the last 17 years ( and counting), the national leader of the APC has earned a place in history as one of the most spectacular politicians who effected monumental democratic change in the country’s political evolution.” \nThis statement of endorsement was contained in a release from the party’s directorate of publicity signed by its director, Barr. Kunle Oyatomi and made available to the media in Osogbo yesterday. \nThe statement continued; “In the last two decades, your (Tinubu’s) deft political strategies have not only warded off political crimes against the Yoruba nation by those who sought and still seek to humiliate and subjugate us, you have also steered the course of events in Nigeria to make what was thought impossible happen. \n“You piloted the APC into an epic electoral battle, which, for the first time in Nigeria’s political history, led to the defeat of a government in power at the federal establishment. \n“That by itself is a signature achievement – the first of its kind in Nigeria – and a milestone in our democratic as well as electoral evolution. It is an uncommon feat”, the party claimed. \n‘At 65, Asiwaju is comparatively still young and our prayer is that Allah should grant the Leader good health to continue in his good work, most of which is impacting positively on people’s lives. \n“May Bola Tinubu’s days, months and years bring further progress, stronger and greater democracy to Nigeria in general and Yoruba land in particular. \n‘The APC and the people of Osun stand firmly behind the leader and support governor Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:09:26.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
