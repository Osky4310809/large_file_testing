After his father died, Van Gogh added black-clad mourning figures to the painting in tribute. \n\"The children are safely returned now and they really are safe,\" said Rueger, after pulling back a screen to show the paintings encased behind a thick glass frame. \"They will remain here for many generations to come.\" Vincent van Gogh's 1882 painting, \"Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen.\" Getty Images \nItalian investigators believe Imperiale is living in Dubai and running a construction business there. The arrests of 11 members of his alleged ring last January, including one man who turned state's witness, led investigators to the paintings. \nThey vanished in 2002 after thieves climbed a ladder on to the museum roof and broke into the building in a heist that took only four minutes. They escaped by sliding down a rope. \nThe sea view suffered minor damage when it was ripped from its frame, losing a piece of backing paper from the bottom-left corner. It was a \"miracle\" the paintings suffered no further harm over the following 14 years, Rueger said. \nSeveral major items were uncovered in last September's raid, including a private plane. One investigator noticed an unusual-looking wall, behind which the paintings were found wrapped in cloth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:52:01.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
