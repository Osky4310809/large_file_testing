I have to wash my hands of you because gross. You’re a grown man. \nAlso, you just left a vacation with Kourtney Kardashian , the mother of your children. You are 33 years old, Scott. This midlife crisis has hit early and has gone too far. \nJust buy a stupid motorcycle to deal with the never-ending thought of your body deteriorating into death. \nListen, my guy, if a girl just got her braces off a year or two ago, and they’re not defined as “adult braces,” then she is too young for you. This isn’t the first time you left Kourtney at home to raise your children while you dated someone who could be legally considered a child just a few years ago. \nThis is Megan Blake Irwin, Disick’s fling circa July 2016. She is 22 years old, Scott! \nShe is 11 years your junior! Had you met when you were a senior in high school, she would be in second grade. A few months before this, you were seen with a 20-year-old Kendall Jenner look-a-like, which is TWO KINDS OF CREEPY, SCOTT. \nA 20-year-old is 13 years younger than you. Christine Burke IS ALSO 13 YEARS OLDER THAN YOUR ELDEST SON, MASON. \nDO YOU SEE WHY THIS IS GROSS??? But, fella, do I have to remind you of the 18-year-old you were caught with in 2015? \nJust because it’s the legal age of consent in most states doesn’t mean you have to go that young. \nWhere do you even take an 18-year-old? It’s not like you can grab a drink together. Are you going to see “Finding Dory” together or something? \nIf you are a grown-ass man, you shouldn’t be dating a teenager. \nTeenagers? If a grown-ass man wants to date you, ask yourself why he can’t find someone more age appropriate? \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
