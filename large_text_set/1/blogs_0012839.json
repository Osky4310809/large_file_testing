We believe we aren't in control of what we think because our thoughts seem to fly in and out all day long. But you are in control of your thoughts, and you become what you think about. And that little kernel of truth is the secret power of the mind. \nIt's really not a secret after all. The power is available to every single person, including you. And it's free. \n\"The secret\" is that you are what you think. You become what you think about. You can create the life you want , simply by thinking the right thoughts. \nIn 1956, Earl Nightingale wrote \"The Strangest Secret\" in an attempt to teach people the power of the mind, the power of thought. He said, \"you become what you think about all day long.\" \nNightingale's inspiration came from Napoleon Hill's book, \"Think and Grow Rich,\" published in 1937. \nFor 75 years (and likely long before that), this simple \"secret\" has been taught to adults around the world. At the very least, the knowledge has been available to us. \nSo why is it a secret? \nWe are creatures of habit. We tend to follow the picture in our minds created by our parents, our neighborhoods, our towns and the part of the world from which we come. For good or for bad. \nBut we don't have to. We each have a mind of our own, capable of imagining life the way we want it. We can say yes or no to the million choices we each encounter every single day. Sometimes it's good to say no, of course, or we wouldn't get anything at all done. But the most successful people say yes to life overall. They are open to possibilities. They believe they have the power to make changes in their lives. They aren't afraid to try new things, or to fail. In fact, many of the most successful companies reward people who have the courage to try new things, even if they fail, because the things we call failures often turn into extremely successful things. Did you know Post-It Notes were a mistake in the beginning? \nStart imagining your life the way you want it. Create a picture in your mind and think about that picture steadfastly all day long. Believe in it. \nYou don't have to tell anybody. Have your own quiet confidence that you can make the picture in your mind come true. \nYou will start making different choices in line with your picture. You will take small steps in the right direction. \nYou'll also encounter obstacles . Don't let these obstacles stop you. If you hold your picture of the life you want steadfast in your mind, you will eventually create that life. \nWhat have you got to lose? Close your eyes and start now. \nYou will become what you think about. \nNapoleon Hill's \"Think and Grow Rich\" \n\"The Strangest Secret\" by Earl Nightingale and \"Think and Grow Rich\" by Napoleon Hill", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T19:11:45.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
