It just so happens the not-great goober in this threequal is Jackson Storm, a cartoon car I’m uncomfortably attracted to. \n\nStorm is the next generation. He’s some seriously hot shit. He’s got some of that McLaren-esque full-room-immersion virtual reality race testing going on. He wins. A lot. He probably Instagrams himself squatting on top of his plane with some bullshit motivational quote. \nAdvertisement \n\nWill McQueen get his old-ass shit together? Or is he old news? Time to retire? Time to drink and smoke in Radiator Springs, telling stories of how cool you were?\nNah, he’s gonna win in the end. Probably going to get the questionably stereotypical yellow sports car chick too. Yay kids! Watch your hero be torn down by everyone around him until depression motivates him back to the top, which is only a temporary fix on the linear lock of time we’re all struggling through!\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T05:06:47.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
