We made a good first half, and the guys were smart not to force it. But then we defended badly, threatening to concede a goal.\" \n\"It was necessary to do one of two things: to attack, or to defend and save energy,\" added Allegri, whose side face Sampdoria in Serie A on Sunday. \"We were very good in the first half, but not in the second.\" \nJuventus go into the draw for the Champions League quarter-finals along with the likes of Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid, but Allegri would not be drawn on any of their potential opponents. \n\"Whoever comes we must face with courage,\" he said. \"We will have the strength to go to the final.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:14:33.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
