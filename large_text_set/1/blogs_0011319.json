Photograph: Guardian Graphics for the Guardian Syria Syrian army blames Israel after explosions at military airport near Damascus \nState TV says rockets fired from northern Israel landed in compound of the airport which houses Republican Guards Reuters Friday 13 January 2017 01.15   \nSyrian army command has said that Israel fired rockets at a military airport west of Damascus, the capital, and warned Tel Aviv of repercussions after what it called a “flagrant” attack. \nState television quoted the army as saying several rockets were fired from an area near Lake Tiberias in northern Israel just after midnight which landed in the compound of the airport, a base for Republican Guards. Body of Briton killed fighting Isis in Syria 'has been recovered' Read more \n“Syrian army command and armed forces warn Israel of the repercussions of the flagrant attack and stresses its continued fight against (this) terrorism and amputate the arms of the perpetrators,” the army command said in a statement. \nThe statement did not disclose if there were any casualties, but said the rockets caused a fire. \nEarlier, state television said several explosions hit Mezzah military airport compound near Damascus and ambulances were rushed to the area, without giving details. \nThe airport, located southwest of the capital, had been a base used to fire rockets at former rebel-held areas in the suburbs of Damascus. \nIsrael in the past has targeted positions of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group inside Syria where the Iranian-backed group is heavily involved in fighting alongside the Syrian army. \nIsraeli defence officials have voiced concern that Hezbollah’s experience in the Syrian civil war, where it has played a significant role and recently helped the Syrian army regain the eastern sector of the city of Aleppo, has strengthened it. \nRebels operating in the area have said Hezbollah’s major arms supply route into Damascus from the Lebanese border has been targeted on several occasions in recent years by air strikes. This has included strikes on convoys of weapons and warehouses. \nDamascus airport was also hit by air strikes in 2013. Tel Aviv neither confirms nor denies involvement in striking targets inside Syria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:23:37.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
