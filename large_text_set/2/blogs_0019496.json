By: IANS | New Delhi | Published: February 22, 2017 6:00 PM Kejriwal’s tweet after media reports said a State Bank of India ATM in Sangam Vihar in south Delhi dispensed fake Rs 2,000 notes. \nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi after fake 2,000 rupee notes were allegedly dispensed by an ATM here. “A Prime Minister who can’t even print notes properly; how can he run the country? He has reduced the whole nation into a laughing stock,” the Aam Aadmi Party leader tweeted. Kejriwal’s tweet after media reports said a State Bank of India ATM in Sangam Vihar in south Delhi dispensed fake Rs 2,000 notes, with “Children Bank of India” printed in place of Reserve Bank of India. जो प्रधान मंत्री नोट ठीक से नहीं छाप सकता वो देश क्या चलाएगा। पूरे देश का मज़ाक़ बना के रख दिया। http://t.co/1qyWFRucEh \n— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) February 22, 2017 \nA call center employee on February 6 withdrew Rs 8000 from the SBI ATM at Sangam Vihar. He later realized that all the four notes that the ATM dispensed were fake. He immediately approached the police station nearby to report the matter, reported Hindustan Times. At first glance, the notes look genuine, but if you look closely, they are full of errors. The notes mention ‘Guaranteed by the Children’s Government’ in place of Guaranteed by the Central Government. The fake notes had ‘churan label’ in place of the latent image and a ‘PK’ logo at the lower half where bank’s seal is seen in the original currency note. \nYou may also like to watch: \nAn FIR has been registered in the matter and Cash Logistics Association has ordered an internal inquiry. Finance Ministry has also sought details from Reserve Bank of India and SBI.
