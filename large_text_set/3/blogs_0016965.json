Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) asked him to respond to comments from a Republican lawmaker that Trump’s immigration ban would be safe if Gorsuch was confirmed.\n“Senator, he has no idea how I’d rule in that case and, Senator, I’m not going to say anything here that would give anybody any idea how I’d rule in any case like that that cold come before the Supreme Court,” he said.\n“It would be a violation of the separation of powers and judicial independence if someone sitting at this table in order to get confirmed had to make promises or commitments about how they would rule in a case that’s currently pending and likely to make its way to the Supreme Court,” Gorsuch added.\nOn travel ban, Neil Gorsuch says: “I’m not going to say anything here that would give anybody any idea how I’d rule in any case like that.” pic.twitter.com/qUrS6ebfbk \n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 21, 2017 \nPushed further by Leahy about the White House’s comments that Trump’s orders on national security were above judicial review, Gorsuch said, “No man is above the law.”\nLeahy asked if there should be a “religious test” in the United States.\n“That would be inappropriate, yes,” Gorsuch said, adding “It’s against the law.”\nHe assured the senators that anybody coming to his court would get a fair shake.\n“Anyone, any law is going to get a fair square deal with me.
