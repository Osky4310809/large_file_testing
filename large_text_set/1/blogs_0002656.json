And while it's still unclear where the former All-Pro will in fact play, Monday, after completing his 10th NFL season with the Minnesota Vikings, Peterson made it clear where he wants to play next year. \n\"I've been here for 10 years, and we have a great team,\" Peterson said. \"We have some great things going on in Minnesota. I would love to continue to be a part of that.\" \nNow that Peterson has expressed his desire to stay in the purple and gold for the remainder of his career, only two questions remain: Do the Vikings want Peterson back, and will he be willing to take a pay-cut to remain in Minnesota? \nThe 31-year old back is coming off a season in which he suffered a torn meniscus and played in just three games, during which he was largely ineffective due to both poor offensive line play and lack of burst and agility that we've grown accustomed to seeing from Peterson. The Vikings back finished the season with just 37 carries for 72 yards (1.9 yards per carry) and three receptions for eight yards (2.7 yards per catch). \nPeterson is set to make 18 million dollars next year, an unheralded amount for a running back of his age coming off yet another knee surgery, but Peterson declined to discuss his contract, simply saying, \"In due time, we'll cross that bridge.\" \nDespite missing most of the 2016 season, Peterson believes he can play at a high level for many years to come. \n\"I feel good,\" Peterson said when asked about his overall health. \"It's so unfortunate that, especially for the running back position, that you're numbered...I choose to think differently. \n\"If God's willing and I stay healthy, I'll play five more [years], and it's going to be at a high level,\" Peterson continued. \"That's the way that I envision things going for me when it comes to my career.\" \nVery few running backs in history have ever produced solid numbers at 31+ years of age, and those that have are some of the all-time greats such as Emmitt Smith and Marcus Allen. \nAs was previously mentioned, Peterson may have the desire to return to Minnesota and finish out his career as a Viking, but it's a two-way street and the Vikings have to want him back as well. That is something Peterson recognizes and understands. Such a realization though has given Peterson an opportunity to reflect and prepare should such a possibility become a reality. \n\"I've been taking in a lot here the past couple weeks, and just the fans here,\" Peterson said. \"You just kind of sit back and think about all the times you had here, and your teammates, and things like that. \n\"At the end of the day, it's a business, so I always just let the chips fall where they may,\" Peterson continued. \"But I would love to finish my career here and try to help bring a Super Bowl to Minnesota.\" Check out Vikings.com for more information and Minnesota Vikings coverage throughout the year!
