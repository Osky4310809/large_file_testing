Others were sealed for selling above government approved pump price or shortchanging their customers by under-dispensing the product”, Nwokedi said. \nAnswering another question, the zonal DPR boss promised that his office would continue to monitor the activities of owners of petroleum products outlets, to ensure compliance. \nOn the sensitization of the citizenry on the use of LPG, Ogbuefi Nwokedi said that his office had successfully carried out the campaign in Enugu, Ebonyi, Anambra and Abia states. \n, stressing that the workshops were part of the Department’s response to the recent spate of fire incidents at LPG plants in the country. \n“LPG is not evil as has been peddled in some quarters and that it is in fact cheap, clean and safe to use, if people follow specifications and guidelines”, Nwokedi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T07:00:50.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
