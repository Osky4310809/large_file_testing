Iwobi \nSections of the club support have held ‘Wenger Out’ protests ahead of recent games, with the weekend loss to West Brom seeing two opposing plane banners flown over the Hawthorns. \nIwobi accepts the frustration among fans but questioned the method of reaction, telling reporters: “They need to have a bit more respect in my opinion. He’s been at the club for 20 years, he’s achieved a lot. \n“Obviously they’re a bit impatient with the results and where they want to finish. We also want to finish there, we want to win the league like anyone else. I can guarantee we are trying our hardest. \n“Whatever happens we are the players, we affect the result. We don’t really look at the banners or what fans are screaming, we focus on trying to do our jobs on the pitch.” \nStandard Sport understands Wenger is yet to decide on his future and is using the current international break to assess his options, and Iwobi confirmed he remains in the dark over the situation. \n“Honestly, I’m waiting as much as you guys are. I don’t know exactly what’s going on. But me, personally, I’d like him to stay. \n“No matter who is in the job, or who gets the role, we’re always going to fight for the manager, every player always gives 100 per cent, no matter what, we’ll just play \n“He always backs our players and he is a great man. He’s been great to me as well, \n“For what he’s done for me, I’d like to say thank you, for bringing me in to such a world-class team, and I’m playing almost regularly.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:47:03.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
