The Punjab Government is expected to file a response to the Haryana government's allegations that the state violated a court order to maintain the status quo. \nPunjab had de-notified the area for returning it to farmers, a move put on hold by the apex court. The SYL issue was one of the key issues in the high-octane Punjab elections, which were held earlier this month. The state filed an appeal asking that the court hearing be put off till the results of state assembly election, but its request was turned down. \nPunjab (DGP Suresh Arora held a meeting at Shambu, and also conducted an aerial survey. Nearly 5,000 policemen from Punjab have been moved to Patiala, and stationed at all entry points. Another 10 companies of Central Armed Police Force are at the disposal of Punjab Police. \nSources in MHA told Mail Today that the Joint Secretary of Centre State division is expected to be in Chandigarh on Wednesday. He's likely to meet the DGPs of both the states. \nMHA sources also confirmed that the Centre was \"willing to offer more CAPF to the states if they so demanded.\" \nThe apex court declared Punjab's 2004 law to terminate an agreement for sharing SYL canal water with neighbouring states unconstitutional on November 10, 2016. \nThe court ruled that Punjab couldn't take a 'unilateral' decision to terminate the agreement - with Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi and Chandigarh - on the sharing of Ravi-Beas river waters. \nThe apex court had ordered status quo on the land acquired for the construction of the canal's stretch in Punjab and appointed the Union Home secretary, Punjab's chief secretary and the director general of police as receivers.
