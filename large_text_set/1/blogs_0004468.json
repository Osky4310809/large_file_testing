On Friday, she'll be the oldest woman to perform a spacewalk.\nWe’re excited to do our first #spacewalk of 2017! The #NASAvillage prepared us for this moment.

The second on Jan. 13 will wrap up the battery installation that the two astronauts started.\nTheir out-of-this-world walk is important, but most of the complex work was done back on Earth by someone using a remote-controlled robotic arm and hand, according to NASA.\nIn an interview with the Associated Press earlier this week, Whitson said she's adapting to weightless life in space quicker than her last trip in 2008.\n\"I love being in space,\" she said. \"I sleep like a baby. I mean, it is amazing the great sleep. Nothing hurts when you're lying in bed. You can sleep the whole night through. It's great.\"\nhttp://astropeggy.tumblr.com/post/126700052488\nIf you add up her three trips, Whitson has spent over a year in space. Next month, she'll celebrate her 57th birthday while in orbit.\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting.\nBONUS: Faraday Future just unveiled a super fast Tesla competitor — here's what it looks like", "external_links": ["http://astropeggy.tumblr.com/post/126700052488", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASAvillage?src=hash", "https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/G0XbsNLa41dRXZqQYiV3Ww/126700052488", "https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/post.js", "https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js", "https://t.co/5AHEeZz6Ja", "https://t.co/oxfeaE0sQH", "https://twitter.com/AstroPeggy/status/817141428266606592", "https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2017/01/05/astronauts-wrap-up-preps-for-friday-spacewalk/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/MSMfgnzs.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/MSMfgnzs.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/spacewalk?src=hash"], "published": "2017-01-06T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T05:23:59.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
