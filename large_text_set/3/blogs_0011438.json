Meteorologists forecast a blizzard watch for coastal regions including New York City and a winter storm watch for a larger area that includes much of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, upstate New York and New England. (Matt Rourke / Associated Press) Associated Press \nThe Northeast is bracing for winter's last hurrah â€” a blizzard expected to sweep the New York region starting Monday with possibly the season's biggest snowstorm dumping up to 18 inches on Central Park. \nThe National Weather Service issued a blizzard watch Sunday for coastal regions including New York City and surrounding areas of Long Island, Westchester County and Connecticut. \nA winter storm watch was in effect for a larger area of the Northeast: New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New England. \nIn New York City, forecasters said the first snow is expected late Monday or just after midnight, with up to 4 inches falling by dawn. Heavy snow the rest of the day Tuesday could pile 10 to 14 inches more of white stuff, with sustained winds of about 30 mph and wind gusts of up to 50 mph. (Associated Press) \n\"This would certainly be the biggest snowstorm of the 2017 winter season in New York City,\" said Faye Barthold, a weather service meteorologist based on Long Island. \nOn Long Island, a snowfall of 12 to 18 inches was forecast along with equally strong winds and visibility of a quarter-mile or less. \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that the state Emergency Operations Center will be activated Monday evening, with stockpiles of sandbags, generators and pumps at the ready, as well as snow removal vehicles and salt spreaders. \nThe New York City Department of Sanitation is taking similar action and notifying additional workers to supplement staff if needed. (Matt Pearce) \nOnce the nor'easter hits, motorists in New York state can call 511 or access www.511ny.org to check on road conditions and transit information. \nOther areas, including the lower Hudson Valley and northeastern New Jersey, also could get 12 to 18 inches of snow. But those areas were not under a blizzard watch because high winds and low visibility were not expected. \nThe severe weather would arrive just a week after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s. Sunny days and T-shirt-wearing temperatures made it seem as though winter had made an early exit. But the chilly weather and snow some areas received Friday may prove to be just a teaser.
