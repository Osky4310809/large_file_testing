In Cinnamon lingo, all these addons are referred to as ‚Äúspices‚Äù. The goal is to let you spice up your Cinnamon experience so you can enjoy your desktop environment, feel even more at home with it and benefit from niche features and look and feel which go beyond what is developed by the Linux Mint and Cinnamon teams. \nSpices can be installed from within Cinnamon -> System Settings -> Applets/Desklets/Extensions/Themes, or by visiting https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com . \nRationale \nThroughout the years we‚Äôve seen great spices being developed by 3rd party artists and developers. The ‚ÄúWeather‚Äù applet developed by mockturtl is an example of a very popular spice. Just like a killer app, it‚Äôs something many people add to their environment right after a fresh install. Spices like that greatly enhance the user experience in the Cinnamon desktop. \nUnfortunately, throughout the years we‚Äôve also seen spices deteriorate that experience by bringing down the overall quality of the Cinnamon desktop. Some spices aren‚Äôt packaged properly and thus cannot be installed successfully from the System Settings‚Ä¶. some spices don‚Äôt work at all, and in some extreme cases we‚Äôve even seen some spices make the Cinnamon desktop crash or fail to load. \nAnother issue is security. In an ideal world we provide the platform for users to enjoy 3rd party development and for developers to reach their audience in the simplest possible manner. In practice, and we‚Äôve seen this last year when our project and users were the targets of specific attacks, we can no longer blindly trust 3rd parties and expose users to them directly. All changes coming from sources we don‚Äôt trust must be reviewed to guarantee the absence of malicious code. \nScope \nIt‚Äôs hard to reduce empowerment and raise expectations while explaining a trust issue to 3rd party developers and artists (although the changes we‚Äôre implementing also bring a lot of benefits to them which I think some of them will really enjoy) and we‚Äôll do this on Segfault with a separate blog post. \nIn this blog post, I‚Äôll address the Cinnamon users and explain the changes we implemented. \nThanks \nBefore I start I‚Äôd like to thank to Design Team, and in particular Eran Gilo for his beautiful design, and Carlos Fernandez, Darryn Bourgeois and Nick Karnaukhov for their amazing work on the implementation. \nI‚Äôd like to thank the Development Team also for helping me define all these changes and discussing them with me. \nRevamped Spices website \nThe first thing you‚Äôll notice when visiting https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com is the new look and feel. \nThis is the result of the work produced by the Design Team. As you can see, things look much better when designed by artists üôÇ \nYou‚Äôll also notice that you can no longer login, logout or register on the website. The reason for this is that a second update is coming. The Design Team is currently revamping authentication, comments and ratings. \nIn the past you needed to sign up on the website, wait for an email, log in and then you could comment and rate spices on a scale of 1 to 5. \nThis is all getting changed. \nWe don‚Äôt need to know your email address or to store your password and we no longer want to. You‚Äôll no longer sign up or login with us. You‚Äôll have the ability to use your existing online identity so you‚Äôll review and rate as yourself directly, without needing a dedicated account. We‚Äôll very likely support Facebook, Github and Google, and possibly other social networks. \nRatings will be simplified. In the past you could downvote spices and your rating carried the same weight on the score whether it was done last week or 4 years ago. This made it easy for people to trick the system unfairly and it made it hard for new spices to compete with established ones. Going forward you‚Äôll only be able to ‚Äúlike‚Äù things. Spices will be considered ‚Äúpopular‚Äù not only because they received many ‚Äúlikes‚Äù, but also because they did so ‚Äúrecently‚Äù. \nImproved security \nAll code changes affecting spices are now version controlled. \nAll code changes made by untrusted parties are now reviewed. \nImproved maintenance \nSpices used to be developed solely by their author. \nThey‚Äôre now maintained co-jointly by their author, the Development Team and a new team made of trusted Spices developers. \nThis brings a lot of benefits‚Ä¶ \nIn the past, if the author of a spice didn‚Äôt fix something, it never got fixed. In contrast, anyone can fix bugs in spices now. The Development Team can commit the fix directly into it and anyone else can provide a fix via a pull request on github. \nIt doesn‚Äôt mean all bugs will get fixed, but it‚Äôs certainly going to boost bug fixing in Cinnamon spices. \nMaintenance is centralized and bug fixes can be done across the board and affect multiple spices. If somebody fixes something in one spice and the same fix could be applied to other spices, that person has the ability to provide a single fix affecting multiple spices. In the past, this rarely happened, because it would have required an author to communicate with other authors and for them to copy over their fix. \nSpices can gain support for future versions of Cinnamon ‚Äúbefore‚Äù they come out. Cinnamon 3.2 required changes in themes and many of them don‚Äôt look good as a result. The development team is now able to modify spices as changes are being implemented in Cinnamon itself. It‚Äôs not just a matter of telling artists and developers about changes which affect their spice, we‚Äôre now able to actually fix things for them directly before ever breaking them üôÇ \nStreamlined development delivery \nThe development of spices now happens on Github. It‚Äôs all version controlled and using top of the art technology and the same tools we‚Äôre using to develop Cinnamon itself. \nChanges made on Github are synced automatically towards the https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com website and towards your desktop environment. If we fix a bug on Github, a few minutes later it‚Äôs there on the website and your Cinnamon desktop sees it as an available spice update. \nIf you browse the website and look at a particular spice, you‚Äôll see when it was last edited and what its last commit is. If you click on this commit hash, you‚Äôll see its Git history, i.e. all the changes that occurred to that spice. \nLimitations \nBe aware that when the authentication/comments/rating revamp arrives we‚Äôll reset all the scores to zero and we might also start from scratch on the comments. \nAll spices kept their existing ‚Äúuuid‚Äù (which represents their unique identity) except for themes (which didn‚Äôt have any in the past). In layman terms this means that changes made to applets, desklets and extensions will be detected by your Cinnamon desktop as new versions of these spices‚Ä¶ but this won‚Äôt happen for themes that you already installed, since their uuid changed. \nIf you installed themes, please remove them and reinstall them. Once this is done you‚Äôll be able to update them again when changes are pushed. \nInformation for developers and artists \nIf you are developing spices, please also read http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2017/01/changes-to-cinnamon-spices-for-developer-and-artists/ You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.
