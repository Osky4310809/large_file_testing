That’s just going to have to wait until we hear from Derrick himself,” coach Jeff Hornacek said after the game, having not said anything at his pre-game briefing. \nHornacek said the Knicks expected Rose back: “We’re not going to go into it. Everything will become clear later on.” \nFred Kerber of the New York Post wrote: “Texts to Rose’s agent, B.J. Armstrong, went unanswered. Across social media, no one seemed to have an indication what was going on as some proclaiming knowledge of Knicks insiders’ thinking claimed they also were clueless. \nAdrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical tweeted Rose was unhappy over his fourth-quarter benching in Milwaukee but that it was unclear if that displeasure was related to his absence. Wojnarowski cautioned Rose could have a legitimate excuse for his absence.” \nThe Knicks had nonchalantly announced Brandon Jennings as the team’s starting point guard before the game, while the team was reportedly still unclear of Rose’s whereabouts. Sources: There are team officials, teammates and close associates unclear of reason for Derrick Rose's absence for Knicks-Pelicans at MSG. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) January 10, 2017 As you'd expect, sources say Rose was unhappy with fourth quarter benching on Friday in Milwaukee -- but unclear if that's impacted absence. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) January 10, 2017 Sources: At tip-off, Knicks still hadn't been in contact with Derrick Rose. Unclear if they've reached him -- or kept trying -- during game. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) January 10, 2017 At least one team official who tried to reach Derrick Rose before the game on Monday was unable to do so, league sources told ESPN. — Ian Begley (@IanBegley) January 10, 2017 \nThis marks the fifth missed game of the season for Rose, who is averaging 17.3 points and 4.5 assists per game for the 17-21 Knicks. \nThe Knicks would end up losing the game against the Pelicans — 110-96 — which is the team’s eighth loss over the past nine games. \nAnthony Davis finished with 40 points and 18 rebounds before limping off the floor after a hard fall, while Tyreke Evans chipped in with 12 points off the bench. \nJennings led the way for the Knicks with a team-high 20 points. It appears no-one knows where Derrick Rose is.
