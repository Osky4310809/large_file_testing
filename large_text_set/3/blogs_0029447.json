Before this, Gmail users had the option of switching between Gtalk and Hangouts. Google, in a blog post, said, “Talk users within Gmail will receive a prompt in the next few weeks, inviting them to switch to Hangouts.” \nUsers will have the option of switching to Hangouts till June 26, if they are still using Gtalk.
