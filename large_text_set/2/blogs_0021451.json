The setup pass for Borgstrom’s 16th goal of the season came from sophomore Troy Terry, who finished with a goal and two assists. \n“It was an odd man chance coming up,” Borgstrom said. “And when I see No. 19 (Terry) has the puck, I’m always sure that he will find me. I was coming late and he passed the puck to me. It was a little bit of a lucky goal, but I guess we deserved it. We had plenty of chances.” \nOn Borgstrom’s shot, St. Cloud State goalie Jeff Smith, who finished with 34 saves, had a chance to clamp down on the puck under his arm, but it got through and into the net. \n“He was pretty frustrated because he had a couple of great opportunities that usually he doesn’t miss on,” DU coach Jim Montgomery said of Borgstrom. “The frustration was wearing on him, so for that one to squeak through, I think you could tell from his celebration how excited he was.” \nSophomore center Dylan Gambrell had two goals for the Pioneers, who at the end of the night had a one-point lead over second-place Minnesota-Duluth in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. \n“I thought it was a great game,” Montgomery said. “To me that’s a playoff game, an NCAA-type game where there’s momentum swings, there’s a lot of emotion in it.” \nTerry had the first DU goal, off a terrific blind backhanded pass from Borgstrom only 3:08 into the game. \nSCS took a 2-1 lead in the next five minutes on goals from Mikey Eyssimont and Jon Lizotte, but Gambrell made it 2-2 at 12:05 of the first before scoring again on a sneaky backhander through Smith’s five-hole in the early stages of he second.
