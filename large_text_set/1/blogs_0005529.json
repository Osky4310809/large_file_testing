A couple of days back, the lady claimed that she was caused a lot of trouble by the ground staff of Jet Airways. She claimed she was offloaded as she was a Hindu. \nPayal was travelling with her beau, wrestling champion Sangram Singh to Kerala. The flight was at 6.50am but they reached the airport at 6.20. In a Facebook live, she said that the staffers who offloaded them were Muslims and they were targeted for their religion. The actress expressed her ire on social media platforms saying that though she was a celeb she stood up for what was right. However, people did not take lightly to her idea of giving the matter a communal twist. They said she should have been on time instead. üòÇ I need to unsync mobile data now from my cell to sleep.
