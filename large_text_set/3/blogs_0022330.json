The meeting will include Secretary of Defence James Mattis and will be focused solely on counterterrorism and the eradication of Isis. \nNato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will also be in attendance at the counterterrorism meeting. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon is supposed to represent the US at the April Nato summit. \nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the move to skip the main summit sends “a most unfortunate signal.” Germany rejects Trump's claim it owes Nato and US 'vast sums' \nIt is not unprecedented for a US Secretary of State to miss a Nato meeting. But, Jorge Benitez a Senior Fellow at the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security and Director of NATOSource, told The Independent that it a \"major issue\" because \"US plays a leading role in the Alliance and it is difficult to make important Nato decisions without our top leaders participating and building agreement between the 27 other allies.\" Matthew Wallin, Senior Fellow at American Security Project, told The Independent that it “may have just been a scheduling error…[but] it’s an unfortunate error.” \nMr Wallin said that given the proposed budget in which Mr Trump committed an extra $54 billion to defence, skipping the summit “may not send a message, but could be received as one by allies.” \nMr Benitez cited a Reuters report that stated Nato offered to reschedule the meeting so Mr Tillerson could meet Mr Xi, but that the State Department had refused. \n\"If true, Tillerson’s behaviour is a slap in the face to America’s strongest allies,\" said Mr Benitez. \nThe meeting would have been a good opportunity to gain much-needed multilateral diplomacy experience for the former Exxon CEO as well as sending a signal of a reciprocal relationship, explained Mr Benitez. \nPresident Trump has been open in his criticism of Nato, calling it “obsolete” and saying countries who contribute less than the agreed upon two per cent of GDP like Germany, “owe” the US for its military assistance. \nHe has also said on numerous occasions that he wants a better relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a man he says he respects. \nThe decision to schedule a visit to Russia, not meeting officials in a third country or the US, comes the day after a House of Representatives hearing with FBI Director James Comey, who confirmed the agency is investigating ties between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russia in the context of Russian interference in the election. \nMr Wallin said that though Russia, China, and Isis are important foreign policy priorities for the US for a variety of reasons, those relationships should “not [come] at the expense of Nato allies.” \nBrian Klaas, ‎Fellow in Comparative Politics at London School of Economics, told The Independent that “if Vladimir Putin had a wishlist, near the top of it would be Trump calling NATO “obsolete,” then having an icy meeting with Angela Merkel, before Secretary of State Tillerson snubs NATO by missing a key summit. \nThese could be damaging moves to US foreign policy even without Mr Trump’s rhetoric on Nato and Russia, but Mr Klaas said there is a growing distrust in the EU about Mr Trump’s commitment to a Western security alliance. \nMr Trump not sending Mr Tillerson to the Nato summit is “raising alarms across Europe — and in the Baltic states in particular — as to whether the United States truly believes in NATO and will honor its commitments to it,” explained Mr Klaas.
