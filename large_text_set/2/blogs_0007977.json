TNT moves ahead 2-1 in the best-of-7 semifinals series against defending champion San Miguel. Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The veteran-rookie combo of Ranidel De Ocampo and RR Pogoy produced a combined 46 points as TNT KaTropa withstood defending champions San Miguel Beermen, 98-92, in Game 3 of the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup semifinals on Sunday, February 12 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. \nDe Ocampo finished with 26 points with 9 rebounds while Pogoy pulled down 7 rebounds and tallied two steals. \nTNT, which led by as many as 12 in Game 3, appears to already have San Miguel's number as they've won back-to-back games after losing the first for the 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 series. \n\" We're just thankful because finally the referees are calling the fouls on June Mar,\" remarked head coach Nash Racela. \"Last game he played 40 mins and he just had a foul. At least today they were seeing it, and they were calling that. That gave us a good chance.\" \nJayson Castro and Kelly Williams pitched in 11 markers apiece while Mo Tautuaa added 10 as TNT's bench once again outscored San Miguel's, 31-16. \nThe Beermen's starters carried most of the scoring load with Alex Cabagnot leading at 18 points to go with 7 boards and 7 dimes. \nMarcio Lassiter also had 18 markers on 5-of-18 shooting as June Mar Fajardo settled for 16 points and 9 rebounds with 5 fouls. \nChris Ross and Arwind Santos had a combined 24 points as San Miguel overpowered its foe on the boards, 49-39. The Beermen also had the advantage in free throws, 16-of-26, compared to the KaTropa's 9-of-12. \nVeteran Danny Seigle, meanwhile, registered two blocks to become the 49th player in league history to reach 300, per PBA statistician Fidel Mangonon III. \nSeigle, who had at least one block on Fajardo, also is the 11th active player to tally that many blocks. He achieved the feat playing against his former team where he carved out his legend. \nGame 4 will be played on Tuesday, February 14. \nScores : TNT (98) : De Ocampo 24, Pogoy 22, Castro 11, Williams 11, Tautuaa 10, Rosario 9, Seigle 4, Fonacier 3, Rosales 2, Reyes 2, Carey 0, Golla 0, Sumalinog 0, Ganuelas-Rosser 0.
