PUBLISHED: 14:15, Thu, Mar 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 14:54, Thu, Mar 23, 2017 GETTY Theresa May has received a second big Brexit boost in a matter of hours \nIn a second massive boost to Theresa May’s negotiating hand the influential Advisory Council on International Affairs (AIV) said only an ambitious and bespoke pact with the UK will suffice. \nIt advocated a “CETA plus” model for future relations, which would incorporate large parts of the trade deal Brussels recently signed with Canada plus extra special clauses to ensure deeper ties with Britain. \nIn particular the Council said it wants to see a wide-ranging agreement covering the all-important services sector, a vital concern for London’s massive finance industry.

GETTY Yesterday Michel Barnier vowed to seek a unique trade deal with the UK GETTY The Netherlands is currently forming a coalition likely to be led by PM Mark Rutte \nAnd in their report the Dutch MPs write: “The new relationship concerning the EU and the UK's future trade relations is crucial for both parties. \n“With regard to this relationship, the AIV believes that the free trade agreement with Canada (CETA) offers the best clues. \n“The AIV considers it politically feasible to bring about future cooperation based on this model but at an even higher level, also adding elements from the association agreements concluded with the immediate neighbours of the EU. \n“A so-called CETA-plus model not only opens up the possibility of free trade in goods, but also makes it possible to reach agreements on the liberalisation of service sectors.” \nThe report adds: “With regard to financial services, for the AIV it is of paramount importance to minimise disruption to the financial system within the EU and to mitigate as much as possible the negative effects of Brexit on the financial services system.” \nIt concludes that a three-year transitional deal keeping Britain in the Customs Union would probably be required whilst the terms of the future agreement were thrashed out. A so-called CETA-plus model not only opens up the possibility of free trade in goods, but also makes it possible to reach agreements on the liberalisation of service sectors Dutch MPs \nAnd incredibly the MPs even suggested that a new, temporary arbitration organisation could be set up if Mrs May refuses to be bound by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) during that period. \nElsewhere, they recognise that Brexit will have “major consequences” for both the Netherlands and the EU financially and call on net contributors to the Brussels budget to help each other out during the negotiations. \nThe MPs also propose radical reform of the free movement system, arguing that it is not just the UK which has serious concerns about high levels of immigration and the undercutting of wages. \nThey write: “The EU Member States would, in the view of the AIV, do well to look at initiatives with a view to ensuring a better and fairer functioning of free movement of workers within the EU regardless of Brexit.” \nAnd they effectively rule out pumping more money into Brussels coffers to cover the loss of British contributions, saying the Netherlands’ budget payments must remain “constant and in any event not higher”.

At the heart of that partnership there will be a free trade agreement that we will negotiate on in due course. That free trade agreement will be sui generis, it will be unlike any existing one so we need to prepare for that.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:24:51.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
