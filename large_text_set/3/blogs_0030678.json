Johnson, 35 percent; \nJohn F. Kennedy, 56 percent; \nDwight D. Eisenhower, 48 percent; \nHarry S. Truman, 22 percent. \n“Presidential job approval ratings are fluid, and all presidents have seen both upward and downward swings in their ratings at various points in their administrations — a historical precedent indicating Trump’s approval could drop further or recover in the weeks and months ahead,” Gallup said in releasing its results. \n“An encouraging sign for Trump, perhaps, is that all presidents whose ratings fell below 36% — with the exception of Nixon — saw their ratings improve thereafter. Clinton provides a particularly relevant example. His approval rating dropped to 37% in June 1993 but recovered to 56% by September of that year.” \nTrump’s approval rating was at its highest, 46 percent, just after his inauguration. \nBut at the same time, Trump began his presidency with a record-high disapproval rating of 45 percent, that climbed above 51 percent after just eight days on the job, making Trump the fastest president to attain a majority job disapproval rating . \nTrump has paid close attention to apparent measures of his popularity, including his social media following and crowd sizes at his inauguration and at his campaign rallies. \nThen again, Trump has played down poll results that were not in his favor, questioning their accuracy and describing them as phony and rigged. And many polls during the campaign underestimated his support around the country and his odds of winning the presidency. \nGallup says its presidential job ratings are based on telephone interviews with approximately 1,500 adults nationwide. The margin of error is ±3 percentage points, the company says. Matt Rocheleau can be reached at .
