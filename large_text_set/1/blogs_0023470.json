I love the tactile analogness of them,” Farrell said of vinyl records, adding that she was a former music photographer who shot album covers. \n“I am drawn to the photography and album cover artwork. They are a cultural reference to a time, a place, a vibe, affordable limited edition art pieces on their own. Many times, I pick them up for the covers without knowing the music.” \nSome of her favorites include Prince’s “Dirty Mind,” Sly Stone’s “High on You” and David Bowie’s “Hunky Dory.” \nThe shop will offer records ranging from $2 to more than $100. \n“We aren’t into the minutiae that some of the extreme vinyl junkie collectors are,” Farrell said. \n“We are interested in listenability and covers in decent condition.” \nVisitors can pick up “political art,” handcrafted goods and a variety of other offerings, with items like natural dye kits and products, cosmetics and shirts from the Feminist KILLJOY Club, whose proceeds help benefit organizations like Planned Parenthood, according to Farrell. \nHalsey & Lewis will also sell plants, 1970s paperbacks and vintage hardcovers, with titles from authors including the Bronte sisters and James Baldwin. \nFarrell, who has lived in the neighborhood for 10 years, said the new business will be an “alternative to mass-produced, corporate shops.” \nThe owners will host an opening party at the store on Feb. 11 from noon to 8 p.m. at 478A Halsey St.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T03:18:33.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
