He will be deeply missed and I wish him all the best in the future.”\nThe slugger was sentenced in June 1996 to two years of probation for evading taxes on baseball memorabilia.\nMcCovey admitted at the time he failed to declare $41,800 in income in 1989, when he made $87,000, and $69,800 in baseball memorabilia income received between 1988 and 1990.\n“It’s one of those things that was overlooked at the time and I do accept responsibility for it,” McCovey then told U.S. District Judge Edward R. Korman in Brooklyn.\n“The only thing I’d like to say is while I’ve always tried to do the right things, I have never willingly tried to cheat the government,” McCovey told Korman.\n \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T03:51:52.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
