We’ve seen them contour with utensils, use spoons to make the perfect cut crease eyeshadow, and use silicone bra inserts as makeup sponges. Whether you choose to incorporate these practices is beside the point, they all deserve a double tap for creativity alone.\nOf all the weird beauty moments we’ve seen on IG, we weren’t quite ready for Laila Tahri ‘s condom hack. In a YouTube video she explains,\n“Here’s why I think it’s a good idea.
