The busy A303 trunk road in Wiltshire, England runs right past Stonehenge. Matt Cardy / Getty Images \nHowever, it sits yards from the busy A303 â€” a historic road linking London with southwest England that has grown increasingly traffic-choked. The stretch of highway nearest Stonehenge is single-lane, creating a notorious bottleneck and prompting many drivers to slow down to get a look. \nPlans for a tunnel at the Wiltshire site were first made almost 30 years ago but have been repeatedly shelved amid concerns about the environmental impact. \nCampaign group Stonehenge Alliance says the latest scheme, which would carry two lanes in each direction, would do \"irreparable damage to the landscape\" and it wants a much longer tunnel that would minimize the road's impact. \nSupporters of the government plan include heritage charity, National Trust. Helen Ghosh, director general, said in a statement : \"I know there will be some sadness that people will no longer be able to see the stones from the road, but visitors will once again be able to hear the sounds of skylarks singing rather than the constant noise of traffic.\" \nShe added: \"After many false starts and challenges, this does for the first time feel like a real opportunity to tackle the blight of the road that dominates the landscape of Stonehenge.\" \nThe Department for Transport said the Stonehenge tunnel was part of a $2.45 billion program of investment in the region and would cut traffic congestion. A public consultation on the scheme will run until March 5. At 1st look, the #StonehengeTunnel may seem a great idea.
