One of the musical numbers she performed was \"My Favourite Things\" from the legendary movie \"Sound Of Music.\" However, the lyrics of the song were deliberately changed for the entertainment of her \"blue hair\" audience.... \n\nMaalox and nose drops and needles for knitting, Walkers and handrails and new dental fittings, Bundles of magazines tied up in string, These are a few of my favourite things. \nCadillacs and cataracts and hearing aids and glasses, Polident and Fixodent and false teeth in glasses, Pacemakers, golf carts and porches with swings, These are a few of my favourite things. \nWhen the pipes leak, When the bones creak, When the knees go bad, I simply remember my favourite things, And then I don't feel so bad. \nHot tea and crumpets, and corn pads for bunions, No spicy hot food or food cooked with onions, Bathrobes and heat pads and hot meals they bring, These are a few of my favourite things. \nBack pains, confused brains, and no fear of sinnin', Thin bones and fractures and hair that is thinnin', And we won't mention our short shrunken frames, When we remember our favorite things. \nWhen the joints ache, when the hips break, When the eyes grow dim, Then I remember the great life I've had, And then I don't feel so bad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:44:20.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
