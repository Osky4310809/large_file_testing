I started the first four games of the season and get injured and we lose at home to Liverpool and Arsenal away and the manager is asking ‘how long till you are back?’ \nPoch: Chelsea could be unstoppable \n\"And then we go 13 games unbeaten and you’re back fit but you can’t get in. And as a player it’s difficult to accept but you have to accept it. \n\"When you’ve got a manager like Conte who’s been honest with me from day one ‘listen you’re not getting back, in the boys are playing great the team’s flying’, you haven’t got a leg to stand on. \n\"I genuinely mean when I say it, but for me I am honestly hoping I don’t play this season which means they keep winning. \n\"Do you get that from a player that’s been here five years? I don’t think you do. Do you get that from a player who plays but moaning every week? I’ve not moaned once. \n\"I’m training unbelievably, you have to, you do things the right way because the love of the club and how much you respect the club and how good the club has been to you over the years.\" \nChelsea team news & likely line-up \nWhile Terry is set to become a free agent at the end of the current campaign, he admits that he is hoping to form part of Chelsea’s coaching staff at some stage in the future. \nHe added: \"I think the love I have for the club I’m hoping I can be back here, in whatever, a year, two years, this year, I really don’t know. \n\"It’s something I want to do, go into my badges, be an ambassador for the club. When I think of Chelsea I think of Lamps, Ash [Cole], Didier [Drogba].\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T10:16:52.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
