Per multiple sources, the Dolphins simply don’t know whether Tannehill will be able to return from a Grade II MCL sprain and a slight tear of the ACL that occurred three weeks ago today. \nWhether the Dolphins will play on Saturday or Sunday could be a factor in the final analysis. Coach Adam Gase has said that, ultimately, the decision will be driven by whether Tannehill risks aggravation or re-injury that would impair his ability to be ready for the start of the 2017 season. \nIf Tannehill can’t play, Matt Moore will continue to take the snaps on offense.
