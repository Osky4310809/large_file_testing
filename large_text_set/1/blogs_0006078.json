The game tells a tale of how Blanka ate a melon on a poacher's truck and unwittingly traveled to civilization for the first time. Playing the game as Blanka, the player eventually faces Dan Hibiki as one of Blanka's mid-bosses. It is then revealed through in-game dialogue that the two know each other and that Blanka had once saved Dan's life. Dan addresses Blanka as \"Jimmy\", and tells him that if ever he needs help, he can ask Dan. \nBlanka faces Zangief as his second mid-boss, and unwittingly prevents Zangief from helping to destroy the Shadaloo criminal organization. He then faces Shadaloo member Balrog before facing M. Bison . After Bison is defeated, Blanka, Dan, and Sakura work together and destroy Bison's Psycho Drive . It should be noted, however, that since many characters' endings in Alpha 3 each depict a different destruction of the Psycho Drive, Blanka's ending might not be canon. Edit \nIn Street Fighter II , Blanka has apparently developed a taste for street fighting and competes in the second World Warrior tournament. In his ending, he reunites with his mother , who recognizes him on televised broadcasts of his matches by the anklets he wears. She addresses him by his birth name, Jimmy, and reveals that she gave him the anklets before he was in a plane crash as a little boy. This crash caused him to grow up in the wild, although he has connections to a local village. Ever since the crash, Blanka/Jimmy had been separated from his mother (who is seen wearing clothes more resembling traditional Thai wear). \nBetween his previous and this appearance in the series chronology, Blanka also learned to speak human language, presumably from Dan. Edit \nBlanka leaves his mother because people kept staring at him, and goes to Hong-Kong with Dan. Dan quizzes him on what the second World Warrior tournament was like. He, Dan and Sakura then decide to enter the S.I.N. tournament, each for their own reasons, with Blanka himself wanting to win and earn people's respect. \nAfter he loses in the final stages, he is wandering through S.I.N.'s HQ. There he bumps into Dan only to see flames heading towards them. The flames die before they can reach them, however, as they are extinguished by Sakura's and Ryu 's Hadokens . It is revealed that his mother went looking for him and they are reunited, with Blanka resolving not to be concerned by the staring faces, since everything will be okay as long as he's with his \"mama\". He goes home, but isn't there long before he finds out that local visitors have arrived at his home to meet him and that he now has many new friends in town. [5] Edit \nYoshinori Ono showed a Brazilian stage in Street Fighter V , during which he was seen wearing a Blanka costume, which lead to belief at Blanka's future appearance in the game. [6] However, this was not the case as it was revealed to be the debut of Street Fighter newcomer (and fellow Brazilian fighter) Laura . Blanka has instead a profile in the official Street Fighter V site.
