He died on November 12, and the virus quickly spread throughout the city’s shelter population.\nNow, The New York Times reports , the entire feline population of New York City’s shelter system—some 500 cats—is being housed at a temporary quarantine center in Queens. The Times described it as “something out of a post-apocalyptic cat video.”\nAdvertisement\nThe virus is a mild form of H7N2 and is usually not life-threatening to cats. According to the CDC, it is only rarely transmissible to humans and causes little more than slight illness. Only one person has tested positive for the virus so far in the current outbreak, a veterinarian who was working with the sick cats.\nBut the mystery of how a strain of avian flu suddenly infected such a large population of New York City’s cats is still cause for concern.\n“Any time influenza viruses start to behave in an unusual way, there’s a concern about what might happen,” Aleisha Swartz, a doctor from the University of Wisconsin veterinary school, told The New York Times . “There’s this virus that popped up, and if we didn’t respond, it could have become widespread in cats all over the place.”", "external_links": ["http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_wisconsin/index.html?inline=nyt-org", "http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2017/01/11/nyregion/15PETCITY-alfred.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/nyregion/sick-cats-virus-quarantine-center-aspca.html?mtrref=t.co&_r=1", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluincats/h7n2-cat-questions-answers.htm", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--6DnHPFkn--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/zkeudekdtl4fdog17hh3.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-13T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:15:50.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
