Unlike traditional hammocks that need two support posts, this bright pink hammock has a curved boat-like base that lets the structure rock independently in place. Agota Rimsaite was inspired by the need to create a comfortable hammock that, in addition to being easily used on-the-go, doubles as a soccer goal. \nThe hammock’s base is made out of curved wooden rails that make rocking possible without hanging the structure from two posts. Inspired by the shape of a surfboard, the innovative hammock design integrates perfectly into a beach atmosphere. Sturdy cross-woven polyester straps offer total comfort when lounging about and its curved design sits up above the ground, avoiding the usual mess that comes with lying on a sandy beach. \nRelated: Sweet desk hammock lets you take a “nap in a snap” \nHowever, once you’re well rested and feel the need to get in some fun exercise, you can flip the Panama Banana over on its side to create a soccer goal for an impromptu game. The designer calls her dual-use creation the perfect flexible furniture for “active relaxation,” and although inspired by long days at the beach, it can also be used in the comfort of a large park or private backyard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:41:18.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
