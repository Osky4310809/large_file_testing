Shares \nIn November 2004, an independent studio named Junction Point was formed by Warren Spector and ex-Valve employee Art Min. The following year, it was announced the new outfit was working alongside Valve to create a Half-Life 2 episode which aimed to \"fill in one of the gaps in the Half-Life universe\" by fleshing out a specific part of its story. This project was ultimately cancelled, however new images offer a glimpse at how it might've looked. \nAs posted on Valvetime.net , the images from Junction Point's interpretation of Half-Life depict the second main series instalment's eerie zombie town Ravenholmâ€”this time covered in snow. \nAccording to Valvetime, the leaked map files suggest this Ravenholm would have included \"small puzzles, scripted sequences, and fights\". Valvetime also notes Junction Point's Ravenholm episode should not be confused with Arkane's also cancelled Return to Ravenholm . \n\"It is implied that the player crashes into a warehouse in a gondola,\" says Valvetime of this episode's narrative. \"He wakes up in a room with two unique characters named Duncan and Scooter. There is a train station and buildings nearby. A group of rebels and Combine Soldiers fight on the streets. Duncan (ravenholm_npc_mueller) and Scooter (ravenholm_npc_scooter) are unique entities. Duncan uses a generic Citizen model, while Scooter's model is unknown. \n\"Some entities use JPS as their prefix in their names, which obviously stands for the studio's name. In addition to this, some objects have fields called magnet and magnetization, which are related to the Magnet Gun mentioned by Warren Spector in the interviews.\" \nThe magnet gun mentioned there was supposedly \"entirely different\" from the existing gravity gun, so said Spector in this Reddit AMA , however \"the two would have been super complimentary.\" \nAlas, it wasn't to be but a snow-themed Ravenholm would've been cool all the same. If not Ravenholm, which other areas of the Half-Life universe would you liked to have seen redone? Let us know in the comments south of here.
