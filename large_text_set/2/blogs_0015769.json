Steve Cuozzo at the Post reports that Stephen Hanson — the restaurateur who founded monster hospitality group BR Guest — will be opening a new restaurant at the old Life magazine building . Hanson hasn’t opened an NYC restaurant since he sold his final stake in BR Guest in more than three years ago . Hanson is an investor in the Herald Square building at 19 West 31st St., along with developer David Mitchell. The 1895 building will become a boutique hotel aiming for “a cool, Nomad-area vibe” and “the spirit of the 1920s,” according to the Post . The Life Restaurant , run by Hanson, will have a lounge with 55 seats, a dining room with 80 seats, and a bar on the ground floor. Chef Michael Vignola , who used to work at BR Guest restaurants, will man the kitchen, serving a “vegetable-centric” menu with seafood and pasta. Hanson founded BR Guest in 1987 and turned it into a huge collection of some of the most popular restaurants in New York City. He is behind restaurants like Dos Caminos, Bill’s Bar and Burger, and pan-Asian clubstaurant pioneer Ruby Foo’s, as well as more upscale spots like Blue Water Grill, Primehouse, and Fiamma, a now-shuttered Italian restaurant that earned a Michelin star while open. Many consider him one of the city’s most influential hospitality figures. The restaurateur sold BR Guest in 2007 to Starwood Capital Group for $150 million with plans for massive expansion, but after the economy tanked, many of the BR Guest restaurants closed. Hanson ultimately left the company he founded in 2013 , citing plans “to pursue other opportunities.” The hotel and the restaurant are expected to debut in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:46:44.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
