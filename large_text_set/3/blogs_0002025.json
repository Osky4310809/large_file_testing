Joined by fellow Plata O Plomo collaborator, Fat Joe, on set of the talk show, Remy revealed that it was “the behind the scene” shade from Nicki Minaj , not necessarily the subliminal disses on “Make Love,” that summoned “SHETHER.” \nShe claimed that Nicki attempted to block her from red carpets and keep her from receiving certain awards. \n“She started,” Remy Ma said. “And I feel like it’s weird because she’s been doing this to a lot of females. From Lil Kim to Mariah [Carey] to Taylor [Swift] to Hannah [Montana aka Miley Cyrus ]. And no one says anything. It wasn’t necessarily the little, subliminal stuff on records. Because I don’t care about records. … It was the behind the scene things that you people will never know about. \n“As far as trying to keep me off of red carpets,” she added. “Trying to make sure awards don’t go to me or she’s not going to be in attendance. Or trying to get people to make bad reports about my album sales. Or just anything that I’m doing to make me look less and make her look better. And I have a problem when you’re trying to stop my bag, when you’re trying to stop me from taking care of my children, I have a problem with that.” \n— Wendy Williams (@WendyWilliams) March 3, 2017 \nDuring her appearance on Wendy , Remy also suggested that a non-malicious convo between herself and Nicki’s ex, Meek Mill did, in fact, go down. \nShe also revealed that she’s not concerned with a follow-up diss from Nicki, who has liked a series of tweets slandering Remy Ma, but has issued no official response to “SHETHER.” \n“I’m not waiting to hear anything at all,” Remy said. “I’m done. Everything that I said, I said. … Me and Meek had a relationship prior to this. When I first came home and he was incarcerated, we would talk on the phone or whatever. And I hadn’t spoken to him since they were together. But I’m not gonna sit here and be like ‘Oh, it was a malicious conversation.’ People feel like he was foul, but there’s a lot of foul things that people do when they break up.” \nRemy concluded her commentary on Nicki and “SHETHER” by stating that the diss record could have been much worse based on what she’s witnessed. \n“This person, just based on what I’ve witnessed, is not a nice person. … The things that I’ve been hearing, I’m like ‘Nah, nah. I’m not gonna say that.’ Please, like that’s too much,” the rapper said. \nAnd these were her final words on the matter: . @RealRemyMa ’s final words on her beef with @NickiMinaj pic.twitter.com/2cATYQ3vb7 \n— Wendy Williams (@WendyWilliams) March 3, 2017 \nWatch the full interview of Remy Ma and Fat Joe speaking with Wendy Williams above.
