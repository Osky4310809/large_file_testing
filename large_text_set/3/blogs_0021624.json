Tillerson spoke on Wednesday in Washington to members of the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. Credit Cliff Owen/Associated Press WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told an international conference here that considerable progress had been made against the Islamic State but much remained to be done — and other countries needed to contribute more to the effort. Mr. Tillerson noted that about 75 percent of the military campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq had been undertaken by the United States. He said 25 percent of the investment in humanitarian and rebuilding efforts came from the United States, as well. “The United States will do its part, but the circumstances on the ground requires more from all of you,” Mr. Tillerson said to representatives from the other 67 members of the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. Wednesday’s gathering was the first time Mr. Tillerson had hosted a major multilateral meeting as secretary of state, and most of his speech and its claims of progress against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, were similar to those of his predecessor, John Kerry.
