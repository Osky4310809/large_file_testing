And there's one simple reason for that: the X-T20 is an awful lot of X-T2 for a lot less money. \nThis probably shouldn't be a surprise: the X-T20 has the same relationship to the X-T2 as the X-T10 did to the X-T1. The only difference is how quickly the smaller camera has followed on its big brother's heels. \nThe sixteen month gap between the launch of the X-T1 and X-T10 softened the blow of Fujifilm offering much of the T1's spec at a lower price. But X-T2 owners are likely to flinch slightly at the sight of a camera with such similar spec announced only four months after the T2 hit the shelves, and the knowledge that it'll be another month before anyone can get hold of one is unlikely to ameliorate the sting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T07:36:03.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
