We have some epic movies lined up like Ok Jaanu, Raees, Haramkhor, Kaabil ... the list goes on. Well, this gives us a sense of déjà vu because we felt the exact same way in the year 2007. Exactly ten years ago, we saw some of the best Bollywood movies, performances and debuts. Let's rewind and have a look at the past. Chak De: This movie is considered one of the best in Shah Rukh Khan's career. His portrayal of the Indian women's hockey team's coach was phenomenal. He might be the king of romance but with this film, he proved that he is the Badshah of intense roles. \nOm Shanti Om : The movie was the perfect amalgamation of music, drama, comedy and action. Basically, a perfect Hindi masala movie. Superstar actress Deepika Padukone made her Bollywood debut with this one, hence it will always be a special film for everyone. \nJab We Met : We cannot believe that it has been ten years since Jab We Met released. This romantic film was no less than a fairy tale. The dream couple Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor were paired opposite each other. \nWelcome : This 2007 comedy can still make you go ROFL. Akshay Kumar, Nana Patekar, Paresh Rawal and Anil Kapoor did a fantastic job in making their audience laugh. \nMadhuri Dixit (she's better than any movie!): The actress had bid goodbye to the Bollywood and settled in America after getting married to husband Dr. Shriram Nene. In 2007, Madhuri made a comeback with the film Aaja Nachle . Although the lack of good script made the movie sink at the box-office, we still dance to the title track of the film. \nTaare Zameen Pe : This movie changed the way people looked at mainstream Hindi cinema. Superstar Aamir Khan made his directorial debut with this film. The movie took home the National Award for Best Film on Family Welfare and Aamir Khan won the Filmfare award for best director. \nCheeni Kum : It was refreshing to see a new pair on-screen, Amitabh Bachchan and Tabu. The movie talked about Tabu and Amitabh's relationship that had a huge age-gap. Different from regular romantic films, this R Balki film was well received by the audience. \nShootout At Lokhandwala : This multi-starrer action film got actor Vivek Oberoi back in the movie business. Vivek did a terrific job playing the role of a gangster, Maya Dolas. In fact, we were quite impressed with Tusshar Kapoor's performance in this film as well. Shootout At Lokhandwala is considered as one of the best Ekta Kapoor's movie productions. \nAkshay Kumar: 2007 can be marked as the year of Akshay. He did four films, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Welcome, Heyy Baby and Namastey London and all these films were tagged hit at the box-office. He was then flooded with several movies and commercial offers. \nRanbir Kapoor & Sonam Kapoor: The two star kids made their Bollywood debut with ace director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Saawariya . The movie had to compete with Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om , hence Saawariya failed to create any magic at the box-office. However, we are glad that the two finally made it to Bollywood.
