I hope together we can make a difference in the game we love.\" \nUbisoft has not been communicating properly. Replies have been very vague and have left us with more questions than answers. \nChief among the demands is better communication. \"Ubisoft has not been communicating properly,\" jbaayoun says. \"Replies have been very vague and have left us with more questions than answers. Ubisoft, we are not asking you to send us a message everyday asking how are day was. However, we would like to know that we are being heard and that you acknowledge our issues.\" \nThe issues jbaayoun mentions have been a major complaint from the community since For Honor launched over a month ago. For example, players are still experiencing a host of matchmaking issues including frequent disconnects and server downtime. Other topics include the incredibly slow rate at which players earn steel, For Honor's in-game currency. As I wrote two weeks ago, some players ran the math and discovered it would take over two years to unlock all the cosmetic items in For Honor without paying money. Understandably, many players were not OK with that much emphasis on microtransactions in a full-priced game. \nTo try and force a response from Ubisoft, jbaayoun proposes that players not play For Honor for at least 24 hours on April 3 and longer if they feel convicted to. \"In general, Ubisoft, we want you to communicate with us,\" jbaayoun finishes. \"We know you can do a good job with this game and we have our faith in you. Just give us a reason to stay faithful.\" \nThat post went live yesterday afternoon and quickly rocketed to the top of the subreddit. In the comments, many players are expressing their support of the idea. \"it's such a fucking shame what is happening to this game,\" . \"People love it so much, despite its flaws, that they actually are trying to host community protests and put this much effort into seeing the game's issues get fixed.\" \nFortunately, jbaayoun's proposed boycott seems to have already workedâ€”Ubisoft is taking action. This morning, For Honor that significantly increases the amount of steel that players can earn from playing: All matches steel income are increased by 25 percent Daily Orders steel income are increased by 33 percent Side Orders steel income are increased by 50 percent Community Orders steel rewards are increased from 500-1000 to 2000 Steel \nAccording to Ubisoft, that can raise the amount of steel you pull in from two hours of playing by about 45 percent. So that means to unlock everything players will need to grind two hours a day for around 1.3 years instead of two and a half. It's an improvement, but that's still a big time investment if you want to have it all. \nI reached out to Ubisoft to get its take on the recent developments and a spokesperson said that on Friday at 4 pm PDT, the developers will be hosting their weekly livestream to answer player questions directly. This echoes a comment left by a Ubisoft rep in jbaayoun's Reddit thread. \"I can confirm that the team went through all the points you raised and we will be addressing them,\" they wrote. \nDespite Ubisoft's promise to address the issues, jbaayoun says that most of the commenters still want to go through with the blackout. Whether or not it actually happens will depend largely on the nature of tomorrow's livestream, jbaayoun says. The ball is in Ubisoft's court at this point. \nBut even if tomorrow's livestream finally gives players some answers, it's clear that there's a serious rift forming between Ubisoft and its community. \"The fact that this is even something that is being talked about in the community, should raise some big ol' red flags,\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:19:55.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
