Aller/Getty Images Alec Nathan Featured Columnist February 15, 2017 The New York Jets notified representatives for left tackle Ryan Clady on Wednesday that they will decline his $10 million club option for 2017 and make him an unrestricted free agent, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter . NFL Network's Mike Garafolo confirmed the news. In addition to creating $10 million in cap room, the Jets also avoided paying Clady a $1 million roster bonus, per ESPN.com's Rich Cimini . The Jets acquired Clady in a trade with the Denver Broncos prior to the 2016 season, but the two-time All-Pro continued to be plagued by injury woes during his lone season with Gang Green. All told, the former first-round pick was limited to nine appearances —including eight starts —before he was placed on injured reserve due to a rotator cuff injury. Those woes kept an unfortunate trend alive. Clady's career has been defined by injuries over the past few years, including a torn ACL that cost him the entire 2015 campaign. According to ESPN.com's Field Yates , Clady has appeared in 27 of a possible 64 games dating back to the start of the 2013 season. While his future remains unclear with the start of the new league year fast approaching on March 9 , Clady could conceivably wind up back in the Meadowlands. According to Cimini , the Jets could \" try to re-sign him after he's had a chance to test his value on the market. This option is a real possibility.\" Considering backup left tackle Benjamin Ijalana is also an impending free agent , general manager Mike Maccagnan has a major void to fill along the offensive line as New York seeks a return to form in 2017.
