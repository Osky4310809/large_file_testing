According to a Valve insider, both Half-Life 3 and Half-Life 2: Episode Three will never see the light of day.\nThis information comes to us from a recent Gamer Informer interview with the alleged insider. According to them, “There is no such thing as Half-Life 3 . Valve has never announced a Half-Life 3 .”\nVarious teams within Valve have worked on projects that could have become the next Half-Life but never did. The insider pointed out how there were three different versions of Half-Life 2 ready before the final version was produced.\n“Over the years,” the source states, “you’ve probably had many dozens of people within the studio as early as probably 2005 working on things that they would imagine for themselves as Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2: Episode 3 .”\n“I’ve heard that some teams have had two to three people working on it,” said the source when asked how close Half-Life 3 and Half-Life 2: Episode Three came to being released. “They eventually ran into a wall, and some teams may have gotten up to 30 or 40 people before it was scrapped.”\nThe insider says that ideas for Half-Life 3 were numerous. This corresponds to rumors of the next Half-Life being a VR game , to featuring characters players can recruit .\n“Some are all over the place, from one end of the spectrum being what you would expect – a single-player narrative-focused game – to completely different entertainment ideas that are as wild as they are weird. […] Some were bizarre, like turning Half-Life into an RTS, or a live-action, choice-driven game.”\nHowever, it appears that Valve just isn’t interested in making Half-Life 3 . According to the source, even Half-Life 2: Episode Three “isn’t sitting right with [Valve president Gabe Newell] and other people at Valve. Ultimately it just starves to death. What you have left is nothing going on with Half-Life .”\nYou should do yourself a favor and check out the entire interview since it really is a fascinating piece. Please note that, while Game Informer trusts this insider, that it could not verify these claims with another Valve employee. Make of that what you will.", "external_links": ["http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/half-life-vr-hinted-at-by-mystery-code", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ze6sdmCKqts?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent", "http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/01/11/searching-for-half-life-3.aspx", "http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/09/half-life-3-valve-adds-suspicious-code-to-dota-2"], "published": "2017-01-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T08:06:36.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
