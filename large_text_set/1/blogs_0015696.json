At the end of the month, they’re putting out a new EP called On The Way To Meet You , and “Happy” closes out that 4-track collection. It’s a warm and simply-constructed song based around Heeyoon’s sweet self-affirmation, repeated enough so that hopefully one day it will come true: “I am so positive/ I am so happy/ I tell myself every day/ I’m starting to believe me.” Listen below. \nTracklist: 01 “On The Way To Meet You” 02 “Separation Is Okay”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T19:58:15.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
