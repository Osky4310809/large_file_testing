Also Read: Steve Bannon Says Media Should 'Keep Its Mouth Shut' Bannon, President Trump’s chief strategist, said in an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday: “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.” He later added: “That’s why you have no power. You were humiliated.” This isn’t the first time the American Civil Liberties Union has offered to take the Trump Administration to court.

Pence looks like he had to agree to shoot his dog in exchange for winning the election. Cheer up, Mr. Vice President. \nPresident George W. Bush looks like a dad attending his daughter's wedding... to Chris Brown. \nSen. Chuck Schumer thinks to himself: \"I perched my glasses precariously on my nose for this?\" \nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas doesn't look happy, but at least he's not as furious as the dude over his shoulder. Who is that -- Anita Hill's husband? \nDonald Trump doesn't look very happy for a guy about to be sworn in as president. \nOh wait: He was just waiting for the actual swearing-in to debut some new cocky expressions. \nBill Clinton used to say he felt our pain. Today, we believe him.
