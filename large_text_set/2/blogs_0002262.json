The actress, writer, singer, producer - yeah, Rachel Bloom does it all - wrote a song for the upcoming musical crossover episode of The Flash called \"Superfriends,\" Buzzfeed reports. Robot Chicken 's Tom Root (she used to work for the series) contributed on developing the song with her, as well. \n“As soon as I heard that they were doing a musical crossover, I e-mailed Mark Pedowitz who connected me to Greg and Andrew. I immediately offered them my services,” Bloom told BuzzFeed News . “As soon as they picked one of my song ideas, I hopped on the phone with my old Robot Chicken boss Tom Root and we brainstormed and, based on that brainstorm, I wrote up the song ‘Superfriends.’ I am so excited to contribute more to the upward trend that is musicals in television and film. Music can be one of the most amazing and efficient forms of storytelling and character development. Also, it was really fun to write a comedy song for two superheroes.” \nThe song \"Superfriends\" will be on The Flash episode \"Duet\" airing March 21; like the 4-show crossover this fall, the action will kick off in the closing moments of Supergirl , but be done in earnest on The Flash . \nDarren Criss, who appeared on Glee alongside Supergirl star Melissa Benoist and The Flash star Grant Gustin (it's almost like this was all planned somehow), has been cast as the villain of the episode, the Music Meister. The character was created on Batman: The Brave and the Bold and voiced there by Neil Patrick Harris. Other actors from the CW's DC Universe with musical backgrounds like Jeremy Jordan, John Barrowman, Jesse L. Martin, and Victor Garber will join the fun. \nSupergirl airs Mondays and The Flash Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend season two finale airs this Friday at 8 p.m. on The CW. The entire second season will be available to stream on Netflix one week later on February 11, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:42:50.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
