Martin Murray says if he can't beat Gabriel Rosado on April 22 in Liverpool it may be time for him to hang up his gloves. \n\"I want to win the UK fans over and put on a show and make a statement,\" he told Sky Sports in an exclusive interview. \n\"I want to win by knockout. Against Martin Murray you are going to get blood and sweat and it's going to be a great fight. A war. I am not going to run and I am not going to retreat. I am just going to stand in the middle and let my boxing skills and punching power talk. Gabriel Rosado \n\"It will kind of remind me of - even though trying to live up to it is crazy - a Ward-Gatti-style fight! \n\"I am Gatti, until the second fight and then I am Gatti in the rematch as well!\" \nRosado has seen two world-title attempts fall short - against Golovkin and Peter Quillin - and has also faced former IBF holder David Lemieux and current super-welterweight champion Jermell Charlo, but has won his last three fights. \nThe 31-year-old has moved back to Philadelphia and teamed up with original trainer Billy Briscoe to give it one last attempt to be crowned world champion. Tale of the Tape: Martin Murray v Gabriel Rosado \n\"I am excited about coming to the UK and I feel a big win over Martin Murray will open a lot of opportunities,\" he said. \n\"They are going to see a different level of speed and punching power and better defence. \n\"I am not going to run and I am not going to retreat. I am just going to stand in the middle and let my boxing skills and punching power talk. You will see the difference. Gabriel Rosado (left) says he has the speed and punch power to come out on top \n\"We have both bean in great fights but I think I have a lot more mileage left in the tank. \n\"He has more miles; he is older and he's dropping back down, so I am looking to capitalise on that and give it one more go to get the world title.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:48:35.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
