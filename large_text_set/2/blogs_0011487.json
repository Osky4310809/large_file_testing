I went to the Fair and was appalled at what I saw. Small metal cages of Tigers pacing back and forth that were also then made to preform as \"entertainment\". Big Cat species being forced to travel across the State in very confined spaces while being used for\"entertainment\" is a cruel and outdated practice. These beautiful creatures are not meant to jump through flaming hoops and be kept in confined spaces. There are plenty of other forms of entertainment that do NOT involve exploiting an endangered species. We are demanding that the Florida Federation of Fairs and Livestock Shows STOP allowing these cruel and abusive shows to be held at their Fairs across the State of Florida.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:05:29.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
