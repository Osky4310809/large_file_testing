Huh/Associated Press College basketball fans are looking ahead to the Final Four, but next year's potential stars stole the spotlight for one night at the 2017 McDonald's All-American Game. The high school All-Star showcase featured 24 of the nation's best prospects, including each of Scout's top nine recruits and 23 5-stars. No wonder the rosters combined for 216 points. And while the final score of the exhibition is insignificant, the West team pulled out a 109-107 victory over the East. College projection had no effect on the grades. They're based solely on what happened Wednesday at the United Center in Chicago. High marks don't guarantee future success, and a low evaluation doesn't mean a player is destined to bust. It's simply an overview of how tomorrow's superstars fared on one night. A's David Banks/Getty Images Mohamed Bamba The biggest critique of Mohamed Bamba is he struggled away from the rim. But since he scored a game-high 17 points at a 7-of-10 clip, that can be overlooked for now. Although Bamba misfired on both threes he attempted, the uncommitted center showed a workable shooting form. He can likely develop a jumper while making an immediate impact on defense, like he did Wednesday with four blocks. Grade: A Troy Brown Jr. As if Oregon fans don't have enough to be excited about right now, Troy Brown Jr. was excellent in Chicago. The nation's No. 11 prospect displayed his picturesque shooting form, knocking down 5-of-9 shots for 12 points. He also grabbed seven rebounds and two steals in 17 minutes. Grade: A Wendell Carter Jr. In 2016-17, Duke lacked a true interior presence who could consistently score. Should Wendell Carter Jr.'s freshman campaign mirror the McDonald's game, he might be that answer. Carter tallied 10 points on a 5-of-6 mark from the floor, adding five rebounds, three assists and one block. The cycle's No. 4 prospect showed great touch on a left-handed hook shot and disrupted several shots on defense. Grade: A PJ Washington Jr. Although the Kentucky commit didn't have a flashy game, PJ Washington assembled a superb all-around performance. Offensively, Washington scored seven points and had one assist. On the other end, he snatched five rebounds and three steals while forcing a couple more contested looks. Grade: A Mitchell Robinson Five-star prospects typically head to blue-blood programs and major-conference schools. Not so with Mitchell Robinson, who is following his godfather to Western Kentucky. Robinson compiled a wonderfully efficient game with 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting, highlighted by a reverse alley-oop. He chipped in three rebounds and two blocks. Grade: A Collin Sexton The All-Star showcase perfectly suited Collin Sexton, a flashy guard comfortable playing at a rapid tempo. Alabama's marquee signee collected eight points, seven assists and four steals. Sexton was throwing alley-oops and tossing off-the-backboard passes and going between-the-legs in midair throughout his 23 enjoyable minutes. Grade: A- Jaylen Hands Out goes Lonzo Ball, in comes Jaylen Hands. UCLA should have few concerns about its primary ball-handler next season. Ranked No. 26 nationally, he accumulated 14 points, three assists and two steals. Hands confidently attacked the rim and drew several fouls, finishing 8-of-10 at the charity stripe. Grade: A- DeAndre Ayton Scout's top-rated prospect, DeAndre Ayton was a beast on the glass. He secured nine offensive rebounds, from where the majority of his eight points resulted. The Arizona pledge nabbed a game-best 11 boards while also tallying three steals and one assist. Grade: A- Kevin Knox If any Duke, Florida State, Kentucky and North Carolina fans aren't excited about Kevin Knox after Wednesday, there might be something wrong with their basketball brains. Knox was a perfect 6-of-6 inside the arc, but the 1-of-5 clip from deep—while disappointing —isn't a long-term concern. He added one block of Ayton at the rim, one steal and one assist.
