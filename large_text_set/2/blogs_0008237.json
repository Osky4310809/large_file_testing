The Principality Stadium, Cardiff - will Rhod make it in?? (Photo: PA Wire) \n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I am supposed to be going to the game at wherever it's called these days but my tickets are on the fridge at home in London. \n\"Yes! Me! Oh man, I'm fed up with this life of mine. I'm always on the road, I'm never in my house, my dog's in the kennels, I'm on the radio, my wife is in London and my tickets are in London.\" \nRhod explained that he had bought four tickets \"and I gave two tickets to my friend Tim Key, from Inside Number 9, as his mum and dad wanted to go and mine are in London. Yes, Rhod, you might well make that face! \n\"I'm trying to get hold of his mum to ask 'What ticket numbers are yours?' so then I can contact the Welsh Rugby Union and say I've got the tickets next to them and I can't get hold of his mum. Carol isn't answering the phone. \n\"Anyway, long story short. Wales take on England today at the stadium and my tickets are on the fridge-magneted to the fridge.\" \nHe asked his wife Sian to take a photo of the tickets that he could show to the WRU but she texted him back to say she was out but eventually, after much panic, he sorted it out thanks to co-host Chris, who rang his friend in the WRU ticket office who saved the day. \nPhew. \nYou can catch Rhod's show on BBC iPlayer .
