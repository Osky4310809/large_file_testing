Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA/i-Images Rowena Mason Deputy political editor Saturday 28 January 2017 22.51 GMT Last modified   22.52   \nTheresa May is under intense pressure to condemn Donald Trump’s ban on refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries entering the US, which could affect dual nationality Britons such as Olympic gold medallist Sir Mo Farah and Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi. \nThe prime minister declined to criticise the ban during a visit to Turkey on Saturday, just one day after she became the first world leader to hold talks with the president. \nAsked several times what she thought of Trump’s order, she finally replied: “The United States is responsible for the United States’ policy on refugees.” \nShe is now facing urgent calls to speak out against the president’s move, and to do more to help UK citizens with dual nationality from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia , Sudan, Syria or Yemen, who will not be able to enter the US for 90 days. \nFollowing the ban, Zahawi, a Tory MP who was born in Iraq , said it was a “sad day for the USA” that he would not be allowed to enter. \n“I’m a British citizen & so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear I’ll be banned from the USA based on my country of birth,” he tweeted. US refugee ban: Trump decried for 'stomping on' American values Read more \nHe added that he had had confirmation from an immigration lawyer that the order applies to himself and his wife as they were both born in Iraq, one of the seven country’s targeted in Trump’s executive order. \nFarah, who came to the UK as a child from Somalia, trains in Oregon in the US but it is not clear he would be able to re-enter the country if he left. \nThe Olympic champion is believed to be in Ethiopia for two weeks before travelling to the UK for competition. There has not yet been comment from his camp. \nOn Saturday night, Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, who is chair of the Commons health committee, said Trump was a “sickening piece of work”. \nShe also called for him to be refused the honour of speaking to Westminster Hall when he comes for a state visit on the invitation of the Queen. \nJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said May should have condemned Trump’s actions. \n“President Trump’s executive order against refugees and Muslims should shock and appal us all,” he said. \n“Theresa May should have stood up for Britain and our values by condemning his actions. It should sadden our country that she chose not to. \n“After Trump’s hideous actions and May’s weak failure to condemn them, it’s more important than ever for us to say to refugees seeking a place of safety, that they will always be welcome in Britain.” \nThe order caused chaos on Saturday, as people who had flown to the US were held at major airports while others were barred from boarding flights or were pulled off planes overseas.
