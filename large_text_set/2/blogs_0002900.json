It might be just Toyota protecting its interests from opportunists, but a Lexus LC F is a logical proposition. \nThe Lexus LC, the production version of the much-praised LF-LC concept from 2012 , is presently available in LC 500 and LC 500h forms. The non-hybrid LC 500 is powered by a 5.0 litre naturally-aspirated Atkinson-cycle V8, derived from the GS F and RC F . Fitted with VVT-i and D-4S direct injection, it’s been breathed on with forged connecting rods and titanium valves, allowing it to spin up to 7,300 rpm. \nThere’s also a dual intake inlet to improve breathing and engine note, along with a double torsion damper on the crank pulley for reduced noise and vibration. The result is 471 hp at 7,100 rpm and 540 Nm at 4,800 rpm, enabling the LC 500 to sprint to 100 km/h in under 4.5 seconds. \nAll that power is sent to the rear wheels via a Direct Shift 10-speed automatic gearbox, with ratios spaced evenly and closer together – there’s an extra gear to reduce the gap between second and third gears, and a 10th gear for more efficient high-speed cruising at reduced engine speeds. \nMeanwhile, the LC 500h makes use of a 3.5 litre V6 – like the V8, it too gets direct injection, but benefits from Dual VVT-i. Mated to the engine is what Lexus calls a Multi Stage Hybrid system, combining an electric motor and an 84-cell, 311 V lithium-ion battery. The company has also added a four-speed auto gearbox for a more direct driving feel. It replaces the reduction gear that amplifies the engine’s output in a traditional hybrid, allowing much greater drive power to be generated when accelerating off the line. \nIf a Lexus LC F is indeed on the cards, something truly special will have to be under the hood to further raise the performance bar. A statement. \nGALLERY: Lexus LC 500", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:59:47.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
