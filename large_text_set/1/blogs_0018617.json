Oil prices fell from $105 per barrel in June 2014 to only $29.04 per barrel in January 2016. OPEC’s recently announced production cuts sent crude prices to $52.04 per barrel. \nIts strategy to kill fracking backfired, however, and just made the process more efficient. U.S. oil production levels remained relatively constant despite low oil prices and declining investment . Companies such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell were already investing $20 billion into fracking technology in August. \nThe total number of drilling rigs in select regions dropped by 64 percent, from a high of 1,309 rigs in October 2014 to only 475 in December 2015. But the decline in rigs was only accompanied by an 8 percent drop in production, according to the EIA report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:36:40.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
