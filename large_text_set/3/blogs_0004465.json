Cruise tours from Hainan to the Paracels were launched in 2012, and last year carried over 12,000 passengers.\nThe addition of air tours is currently awaiting approval from the government and military, according to a document released to Hainan delegates at the National People’s Congress in Beijing.\nThe islets and reefs of the Paracels have been the center of dispute for decades. Vietnam had previously controlled some islands in the archipelago, while China controlled others. In 1974, China gained control over all the Paracel islands in a brief but bloody battle that killed 71 people.\n[ SCMP ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T09:45:35.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
