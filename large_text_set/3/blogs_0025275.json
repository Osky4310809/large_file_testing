A police officer is among the dead. \nSome questions remain following press conferences with Marathon County police, who declined to release the names of those killed. Just before 12:30pm Wednesday, police responded to a ‚Äúdomestic situation‚Äù at Marathon Savings Bank, and then about 30 minutes later, they returned to the bank to find two people shot.
