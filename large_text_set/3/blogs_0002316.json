A permanently inhabited lunar settlement is a difficult and worthy objective. I sense a lot of people are excited about this,” Bezos said in response to emailed questions from the daily. \nThe billionaire’s proposal reportedly seeks NASA support to send a “Blue Moon” spacecraft to Shackleton Crater near the Moon’s south pole. The lander would be able to carry a payload of up to 10,000 pounds and be launched by Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket or by other vehicles such as NASA’s Space Launch System or United Launch Alliance’s Atlas 5. \nBlue Origin's proposal is focused on a series of cargo missions which would be able to carry the equipment necessary to help establish a human colony on the Moon.
