Wigan sacked Joyce earlier this month (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nUnited's four-month search for Joyce's replacement has made progress with some candidates being interviewed for the job. \nHowever, Butt said in January that the Reds won't be rushed and want to make certain they get the right. \n“It's something we're looking at and something we've got to get right,” he said. \n“It's a very important age group to manage and look after. It's the last step into the first team or into different clubs to try to make a career. \n“It's important and we're going through the process of having interviews. We don't want to make it a rush job and get the wrong person in.” Joyce achieved much success at Carrington (Photo: Rex) \nButt, however, doesn't want the job himself on a permanent basis having been the interim manager. \n“I am enjoying it but there's a bigger job and a bigger picture with the club to do, right from the Under-12s to the Under-23s, and it's something I'm keen to get started again.” \nUnited's 23s have only three matches left in their Premier League 2 Division One campaign but are facing a relegation as they stand in eight position in the 12-team league but are only three points off the bottom. \nEx-players like Paul Scholes and Phil Neville, Butt's Class of '92 mates, were initially touted to be included among the candidates but the fact the search has gone on so long suggests United are ready to poach a new reserve boss from another club at the end of the season.
