People use it inappropriately: if they don‚Äôt understand how type works, it won‚Äôt have any power or meaning to them,\" he said.\n\"I once heard a guy at a Rothko show say: ‚ÄúI could have done that.‚Äù He clearly doesn‚Äôt know anything about art. He‚Äôll probably use Comic Sans without realising it‚Äôs wrong in certain circumstances.\"\nComic Sans, which had been a standard in the Microsoft font library since it was included in Microsoft 95, was never meant to have this success.\nAs Connare himself explains on his website , the font was originally designed for Microsoft Bob, \"a comic software package that had a dog called Rover at the beginning and he had a balloon with messages using Times New Roman.\"\nComic Sans is the best joke I ever told. Comic Sans √©tait la meilleure blague que j'ai jamais dit . #comicsans\n‚Äî Vincent ‚úçüèΩConnar√© (@VincentConnare) February 8, 2010\nComic Sans was based on lettering from graphic novels Connare had around his office, in particular Watchmen (lettered by Dave Gibbons) and The Dark Knight Returns (lettered by John Costanza).\n\"I didn‚Äôt have to make straight lines, I didn‚Äôt have to make things look right, and that‚Äôs what I found fun. I was breaking the typography rules,\" he told The Guardian .\nAfter it became a default for Microsoft Publisher and Internet Explorer, the backlash started.\nIn 1999, the \" Ban Comic Sans \" movement was launched by two Indianapolis graphic designers, Dave and Holly Combs.\n\"A group called Ban Comic Sans was formed to educate people about the uses of typefaces, though they did email me to ask if it was OK to set it up. It seemed silly, but I said knock yourselves out,\" Connare said.\nSome designers argued that Comic Sans, while perfectly legit in designs for children or comic books, should have no place in business or professional work usage.\nBut the backlash has now calmed down. \"People who come up to me are more likely to say they love it,\" he said. A Comic Sans 'defenders' project has even popped up on Tumblr.\nConnare said he used Comic Sans only once. When he had trouble changing his broadband to Sky, he wrote them a letter in Comic Sans.\n\"I got a ¬£10 refund. In those cases, I would recommend it. The basic theory is that typography should not shout ‚Äì but Comic Sans shouts,\" he said.\nHowever, Tom Stevens, program manager at Microsoft, admits that the font still gets misused, for example when Cern announced the Higgs boson in Comic Sans.\nRT @CERN : <comicsans>we have observed a new boson with a mass of 125.3 ¬± 0.6 GeV at 4.9 sigma significance.</comicsans>\n‚Äî Santiago Orozco (@sannorozco) July 5, 2012\nDesigners were outraged and the Higgs Boson quickly became a trending topic on Twitter, with amused and outraged users commenting on the typography choice.\n\"The backlash, the level of hatred, was just amazing ‚Äì and quite frankly funny. I couldn‚Äôt believe people could be so worked up over something as simple as a font,\" he said.\nThe font continues to divide opinion and provoke discussion:\n#ComicSans is trending this morning.. it's going to be one of those days (I get unreasonably riled at the mere mention of that font) pic.twitter.com/3UkFVaDsUb\n‚Äî Litchlife (@stonecoldpiper) March 28, 2017\nA reminder of the rules surrounding the use of Comic Sans... #ComicSans pic.twitter.com/JcnF7vbpEk\n‚Äî Glen Foster (@_GlenFoster) March 28, 2017\nIf you still use Comic Sans, God will be sure to shorten your time on this earth... pic.twitter.com/pXEIoTlJJR\n‚Äî Kishen Sedani ‡•ê (@KishenSedani) March 27, 2017\nDisasters‚Äîranked:\nüö¢ Titanic\nüî• Hindenburg\nüíª Comic Sans\nüì∫ finale of \"Lost\"\nüò≠ Old Yeller dying\nüèà Falcons in SB 51\nüèÄ my #MarchMadness bracket\n‚Äî Justice Don Willett (@JusticeWillett) March 25, 2017\nWATCH: Super precise robotic arm reinvents the drawing board", "external_links": ["http://www.connare.com/whycomic.htm", "http://bancomicsans.com/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarchMadness?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JusticeWillett/status/845473072794755072", "https://t.co/3UkFVaDsUb", "http://comicsansproject.tumblr.com/", "https://t.co/JcnF7vbpEk", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ComicSans?src=hash", "https://t.co/pXEIoTlJJR", "https://twitter.com/stonecoldpiper/status/846653376125440003", "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/28/how-we-made-font-comic-sans-typography?CMP=twt_gu", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VSFz0k-FbSkmGuw0rGSYARZIfI8=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2Fn3TqhoCE.jpg", "https://twitter.com/KishenSedani/status/846417952899567617", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/n3TqhoCE.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/CERN", "https://twitter.com/sannorozco/status/220707057949618177", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/comicsans?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/VincentConnare/status/8806817764", "https://twitter.com/_GlenFoster/status/846654958841815040"], "published": "2017-03-28T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T14:00:21.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
