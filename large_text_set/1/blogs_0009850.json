Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Saturday 14 January 2017 00.01 GMT Last modified on Saturday 14 January 2017 00.03   \nA Senate intelligence committee inquiry plans to interview senior figures in the incoming Trump administration as part of its inquiry into Russian hacking of the US election, its chairman said on Friday. \nThe announcement comes one week before Donald Trump assumes the presidency and amid a bitter row between the president-elect and the US intelligence agencies he will soon lead. Angering Congress, James Comey won't address Trump-Russia inquiry privately Read more \nOnly yesterday the chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, had told reporters that connections between Trump and Moscow would be outside the remit of his committee’s ongoing investigation into Russia’s attempts to disrupt the US election through hacking and other cyber-crimes. \nBut in a statement issued jointly with Mark Warner, the panel’s top Democrat, Burr said the committee would use “subpoenas if necessary” to force Trump’s team, as well as officials from the Obama administration, to testify. \n“As part of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s oversight responsibilities we believe that it is critical to have a full understanding of the scope of Russian intelligence activities impacting the United States,” the statement said. \nAmong other things, it will examine “counterintelligence concerns related to Russia and the 2016 US election, including any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns”. \nIn an individual statement, Warner said: “This issue impacts the foundations of our democratic system, it’s that important.

I look forward to working with Chairman Burr on this tremendously important matter.” \nMore details soon ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:11:54.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
