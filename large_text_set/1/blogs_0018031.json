The couple won big at the People’s Choice Awards last night with Reynolds winning his third People’s Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actor, while Lively won her first award for Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress for The Shallows . \nThe actress gave an adorable speech, in which she thanked Reynolds for all his support and announced to screaming fans that he was all hers. But backstage, Lively informed E! News that her ego had gotten a lot bigger after the win. \nDavid Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images Of how she expects the award to change things at home , she told E! News, “[I’m] going to make them lay down their jackets for me to walk across as I enter the home. I’m going to tell my daughter she’s not allowed to vomit on me anymore. No more changing diapers! I’m going to start wearing diapers and make her change mine, just because I’m that incredible now. Clearly, the people think so! ” \nSomebody better relay the message to baby Ines, because something tells us she won’t be following these strict new rules. \nChristopher Polk/Getty Images for People's Choice Awards Lively also took the time during her acceptance speech to talk about the importance of girl power and it was beautiful. She said, “What was so neat about them was that they’re all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power,” she said. “Watching this movie, and the women nominated in this category—when you guys voted for this, you didn’t just vote for this movie or me, but you voted for girl power. And men voted for girl power, too! You guys are awesome for doing that.” \nWe love Blake and how she’s able to be both incredibly funny, but also speaks for important feminist issues. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T04:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:42:08.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
