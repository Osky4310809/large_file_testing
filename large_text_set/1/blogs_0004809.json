The next of these look forward to is 2018’s ill-advised yet increasingly promising young Han Solo film. The film is being directed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord ( 21 Jump Street , The Lego Movie ), a creative duo that seems to be able to make any premise work, no matter how absurd. The script is being spearheaded by Star Wars vet Lawrence Kasdan and his son, John Kasdan. The cast is already rounded out by Emilia Clarke ( Game of Thrones ), Donald Glover ( Community ) as Lando Calrissian, and the up-and-coming Alden Ehrenreich ( Hail, Caesar! ) as Han Solo. Woody Harrelson is now also reportedly being considered for the role of Han’s mentor .\nPart of the reason that so many fans wince over the prospect of a young Han Solo film, is that Harrison Ford has such a unique and irreplaceable charm. George Lucas may have conceived of the self-centered space cowboy, but Ford gave him the lovable swagger that made Han the most beloved character in the Star Wars mythos.\nFans on the fence about the upcoming project will be pleased to know that Ford’s replacement doesn’t seem to be taking this challenge lying down. A recent photo tweet revealed Ehrenreich meeting Ford for lunch, likely to discuss how to succeed in the upcoming project.\nTwo Han Solos grabbing lunch. pic.twitter.com/6utZicjcaZ\n— Nico Sotomayor (@nicosotomayor00) January 4, 2017 Those are familiar with Ehrenreich’ work will understand why he was cast in the role. He exhibits the same underlying “coolness” that Ford uses to make his characters seem at home in the face of danger. His challenge will be in adding the wry smile and cocky attitude while magically making Han’s insufferable attitude likable. It’s impossible to know whether or not even Ford will be able to explain his own charm in a way that will help Ehrenreich translate it to the screen, but the meeting is certainly a good start.\nCould the young Han Solo film be a dry run for de-aging Indiana Jones as well? Disney hasn’t been coy about their desire to continue the series and may be using this spinoff to test the waters. Even if only one Han Solo film is planned, if Ehrenreich miraculously succeeds in resurrecting Ford’s charm, he could find himself reprising his roles for some time to come.\nSource: Nico Sotomayor", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/nicosotomayor00/status/816761727391936512"], "published": "2017-01-05T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:16:46.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
