We get more space, more second ball. We have got one of the best in the world. \n\"He is a strange case, a one-off. When he takes his shirt off and you see his body, he looks 28 or 29. Sometimes, I ask him what he does to continue to play the way he is doing because this is something I'd like to copy. \n\"He is so lucky with his DNA and we are so lucky to have him.\" \nUnited head into the weekend's showpiece with just one defeat since early November. \nSince losing to Fenerbahce in the Europa League on November 3, United have only lost to Hull City in the EFL Cup semi-finals, as they remain undefeated in the Premier League - a run of 16 matches. \nMou could start Rooney in final \n\"Everyone who watches our games realises pretty quickly that a big team is playing because we control all the games â€“ or most of them,\" said Herrera. \n\"When Blackburn Rovers scored [in the FA Cup fifth-round fixture], we didn't go crazy, we kept playing, kept moving the ball from side to side, creating chances. We have a lot of confidence in ourselves and we are showing just how difficult it is to beat us. \n\"I cannot say it is impossible to beat us but it is difficult because we are very compact, we attack, we create chances. We are in a good moment but I always say that football has no memory and, if we don't perform well at Wembley, everyone will forget what we have done.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:53:10.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
