I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nPerez, who represented the moderate-wing of the Democratic Party, defeated Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who represented the extremely liberal-wing of the Democratic Party. Perez was labor secretary under former President Barack Obama. \nTrump’s comment that he “could not be happier…for the Republican Party” implies that there won’t be much change in the Democratic Party and that it will continue to be the party of Obama and Hillary Clinton. \nThat would be a good thing for Republicans, given that the GOP continued to make inroads last year in areas that have been Democratic strongholds for years, including winning three key “blue wall” states in the 2016 presidential election: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \nAnd it appears many Democrats also recognize this fact and understand that they must change their party dynamic if they want to make any progress in 2018 and 2020 as many spoke out against Perez’s election on Saturday noting that it’s more of the “same ‘ole, same ‘ole.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:46:38.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
