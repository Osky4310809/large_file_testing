They move him on, he’s forced out because he wasn’t playing there and all of a sudden (Collingwood supporters) want him back,” Dal Santo said. \n“What, do you want him to play seconds for the rest of the year for Collingwood? Because he wasn’t in their best 22 last year.” \nDal Santo conceded the jeering was part of Australian sport, but also found it strange that Collingwood fans would treat a premiership player in that manner. \nIndeed, the St Kilda and North Melbourne star suggested our game could benefit from how clubs from other codes treat their former servants. \n“I was fortunate enough to be in England about a decade ago when Teddy Sheringham came back to play against Manchester United at Old Trafford for the first time and they actually clapped him,” Dal Santo said. \n“They appreciated his services for that soccer club at that stage and they cheered the opposition player. That’s one thing we never see in our game.” \nSocial media lit up on Friday night, with Cloke’s brother Jason tweeting: “Well done Collingwood boo a bloke that gives you 12 years of sweat and tears ... and was made to go then you boo him, kill them bro.” \nDal Santo said it was unsurprising the booing polarised the football public, and even more unsurprising the Clokes remonstrated. \n“I think that’s the Clokes. They’re very public in the way they come out and support each other,” Dal Santo said. \n“Also, social media is an easy way to support people or bag people. I don’t mind it. It’s nice to have a bit of support in your corner.” \nCloke kicked a monster goal from beyond 50 to silence the boos, and racked up 14 touches and six marks in his debut for the Dogs. \n“I though it was fantastic. The mark, the goal, 65,000 people booing and cheering. It was just a great moment for our game,” Dal Santo said. \n“It was a great game. I love the way Cloke responded.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
