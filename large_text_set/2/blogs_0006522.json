Weird Al Squeeze Box discography will come in a replica of his accordion My grandpa told the best stories—tales I’d ask him to repeat at every family gathering, and which I wish were recorded for posterity. \nUK-based Andvinyly grants that wish—and more—with the option to have the cremated ashes of yourself or a loved one pressed into a working vinyl record. \nWhether you are preparing for the inevitable or cleaning up after someone else, contact Andvinyly to create a unique and personal album to last for generations. \nBut, living on “from beyond the groove” doesn’t come cheap. The company’s basic package starts at £3,000 ($3,771) for up to 30 discs featuring standard R.I.V. (Rest in Vinyl) artwork; the deceased’s name, date of birth, and date of death on the cover and labels; and up to 24 minutes of audio. \nAndvinyly\nAny additional features—original canvas artwork (£3,500 per painting), backing tracks (£250 each), “bespook” music (£500 per track)—cost extra. \nWant to be buried but love the idea of haunting your grandkids via vinyl? Cremated body parts are accepted, as are pet ashes, both of which carry the same £3,000 price tag as the full human body. \nTo save family and friends the trouble of planning a funeral, Andvinyly offers an “experienced team of event organizers” who will arrange your send-off, where you can speak to guests, crack jokes, or embarrass someone from the afterlife. Prices start at £10,000. \n“Please note,” the company’s website said. “Despite the site’s light-hearted tone, all of our servers are carried out with the utmost respect and care.” \nMusician Jason Leach first made headlines with Andvinyly in 2010. But he returned to the spotlight with last month’s release of Hearing Madge , a touching short film (below) in which the co-founder explores the macabre practice of pressing dead people’s remains into records. \nStick around after the credits to see what “other things” the firm can memorialize in vinyl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:54:32.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
