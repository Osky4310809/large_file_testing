Because they haven’t offered free tuition and housing to blacks. That’s not a joke. Progressive students feel that since blacks were barred from education during slavery, they should have free access to it now. And because tuition is so expensive, UWM hasn’t done enough to facilitate proper reparations. \nBut the demands go far beyond simply tuition, of course. Trey Sanchez at TruthRevolt writes: \nBesides free tuition and housing, other demands in the resolution include charging black students no fees, and allowing former inmates for admission. That’s a $20,000 “gift” for having the right skin color. Also, the student government wants UWM to spend 10% collected through donations and put it toward financial aid, “geographically weighted admissions,” and to launch a study to see if making entrance exams optional is viable. These demands are similar to those made by the Black Liberation Collective, which regularly sends demand letters like these to U.S. colleges. \nBlacks only makeup two percent of UWM’s enrollment and overall for “students of color,” enrollment has only risen four percent over the last ten years, from 11 percent to 15 percent. A UWM spokesperson said the school supports the “spirit” of the resolution but doubt it’s legal to fulfill the wild demands. \n“The university’s rhetoric suggests that it is committed to diversity and inclusion, so this legislation compels the university to move towards action which is imperative,” said Tyriek Mack, the student council representative who authored the resolution. “If no one challenges the university’s empty promises, then the racial composition will remain stagnant.” \nBut listen to what a Chinese graduate student said in response: “I wouldn’t appreciate it if the school offered me free tuition just because I’m a minority. We should at least have to work hard for it.” \nWhat a concept, but not one easily understood by progressives. \nHere’s the bottom line: The New Fascists are rising, and they will try to crush all reason and dissent, even among their own. Ultimately, they will fail, but the question is, how bloody will it be getting there? Fascism has many definitions and many faces, but it always involves the vilification and violent suppression of ideological opposition. \nBut this is where the global left is headed. Buckle up; it’s going to get worse before it gets better. Stay  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:40:24.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
