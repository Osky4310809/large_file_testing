Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com \nThere have been no adult psychiatric hospital beds in St. Francois County for more than a year now, but that may soon change. \nA behavioral health provider is seeking approval to open Bridge Tree Behavioral Hospital in Farmington, a 16-bed in-patient psychiatric unit for adults. \nFor $833,000, Vicky Winick, president of Mineral Area Community Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center , wants to renovate a current facility at 510 West Pine Street for what would technically be considered a hospital. \nArea behavioral health advocates are excited about the news. \nCandy Zarcone, president of the St. Francois County Mental Health Board, said the lack of beds for patients with mental health issues had put a strain on area health providers, law enforcement and families of patients in need. \nPatients who need mental health care are either forced to wait in the emergency department for days while an inpatient psychiatric bed opens up somewhere else in the state, or they go without care, Zarcone said. \nAnd sometimes, they end up in the county jail, said Dennis Smith, vice president of the mental health board and administrator for the St. Francois County jail. \n“When families don’t have options, they end up here,” Smith said of the jail. \nIn the last year, he said, more individuals who he believes needed further mental health evaluations have been brought to the jail. A lack of resources meant those individuals were released without being evaluated, he said. \nAnd getting patients to an open psychiatric bed is an issue. \nSmith said usually it fell to law enforcement or the local ambulance service to transport them there. \n“It takes an ambulance and crew out of our county for a long period of time,” Zarcone said. \nThe lack of adult psychiatric beds stems from BJC HealthCare’s decision to get rid of the beds at the end of 2015 after purchasing its only hospital rival in St. Francois County, Mineral Area Regional Medical Center. \nMineral Area Regional Medical Center had a 10-bed unit that did not make the move when the facility was closed and services were transferred to BJC’s Parkland Health Center. \nCurrently, Mercy Hospital Jefferson, in Crystal City, is the closest facility with adult psychiatric beds. That’s about 40 miles from Farmington. \nMercy officials say they have experienced an increased demand for mental health services since the closure of the unit in Farmington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T09:22:22.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
