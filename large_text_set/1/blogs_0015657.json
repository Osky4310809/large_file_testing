Ever since we came across these stunning shots by Yuichi Yokota, a Japanese photographer, we’ve been dying to book a trip of our own to experience winter in Finland for ourselves. After you see these pics, we’re pretty sure you will be, too.\nThe photographer’s trip to Finald started off on a strong note because he came across the aurora borealis, one of the world’s most beautiful sights of all. Like, wow. A photo posted by Yuichi Yokota (@yokoichi) on Jan 5, 2017 at 7:48am PST \nThis shot of arctic mushing blew us away. Just look at that sunset in the distance!

This arctic sunset is the most stunning blend of oranges and blues, and that sliver of moon is GLORIOUS.
