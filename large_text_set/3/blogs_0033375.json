(Courtesy of Police Regional Office-ARMM) MAGUINDANAO, Philippines — Authorities arrested five members of a criminal gang and recovered from them 22 firearms and a mortar launcher after a brief encounter before dawn Wednesday in Omar town in Sulu. Chief Superintendent Reuben Theodore Sindac, regional police director of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, said Thursday the joint police-military operations that resulted in the arrest of the suspects, wanted for heinous offenses, was assisted by local officials. The bust was announced on Thursday by Sindac to reporters while at his office in Camp S.K. Pendatun in Parang town in Maguindanao. He said the leader of the wanted gang, Suadi Kahil Hamja, and four of his followers were nabbed after a firefight with a combined team of police and military personnel sent to arrest them for various crimes, including arson and drug trafficking. One of Hamja’s henchmen, Ardin Akar Paling, was killed while another, who was identified as Nong Haliludin, was wounded in the ensuing exchange of gunfire. A villager named Norherma Galamaddin was wounded in the crossfire and is now confined in a hospital. The operation also resulted in the confiscation from the suspects of eight M-16 rifles, two M203 rifles fitted with grenade launchers, seven M-14 rifles, five Garand rifles, two M79 launchers for 40-mm grenades, one AK-47 rifle, three carbine rifles, a Belgian FAL 7.62 rifle, and a .22 caliber hunting rifle. Also seized from Hamja and his men were a crew-served .50 caliber machine gun and a 60-mm mortar. Sindac said he is thankful to the Army’s 4th Scout Ranger Company for helping the police arrest Hamja and his followers.
