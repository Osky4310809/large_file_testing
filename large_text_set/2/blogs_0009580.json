Despite Oakley’s contributions to the squad, he has been banned by owner James Dolan, which led T.I. to stand in solidarity with the imposing former player. \nOn Friday (February 10), the announcement was made that Oakley would be banned from entering Madison Square Garden. Fans from all walks of life stepped up in defense of Oakley and he has since reached out via Twitter to thank those who have spoken up in wake of the arrest. I love NYC I LOVE the Knicks that you for all your love .. I will be holding a Press conference next week Let's go Knicks \n— Charles Oakley (@CharlesOakley34) February 11, 2017 \nT.I.’s stance was made known via his Instagram account, which featured a photo of Oakley with the caption reading ““If HE can’t go. WE ain’t goin!!! #OGOakley” to go along with the post. What that means exactly isn’t known, but it appears Tip is asking people to not support the team or that he himself will no longer attend games for the duration of Oakley’s banishment from the arena. \n“I love NYC I LOVE the Knicks [thank] you for all your love .. I will be holding a Press conference next week Let’s go Knicks,” tweeted Oakley on Friday. He followed that tweet for by thanking former and current NBA players for also stepping up for him. \nOakley was allegedly booted from the arena for making inappropriate comments during the game, which prompted the response from the arena’s security staff. I want thank all in players and pass NBA players as well as family and friends for all your love and support \n— Charles Oakley (@CharlesOakley34) February 11, 2017 Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
