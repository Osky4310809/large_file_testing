King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 5 hours ago 4 As previously reported , Rob Trujillo noted the most prominent bass guitar on Metallica's new album \" Hardwired... To Self-Destruct \" is his trusty signature 5-string Warwick.And during a recent chat with Bass Player Magazine , the bassist confirmed that the Warwick was almost the only instrument he used during the recording sessions.Rob explained: \"We did a listening test where we had six different basses, and we recorded the same part of a song, like a blindfold test. You play through it several times, and then you listen back and try to figure out which instrument stands out, not knowing which instrument you're listening to.\"There's a specific Warwick 5-string that just took control of this body of music and owned it. The Warwick crushed it.\"Traditionally I've used a lot of different basses; I love Nash P-basses, and I love some of my old Fernandez basses, which were built by the old Tobias luthiers. I used a lot of those on ' Death Magnetic .' But my Warwich 5-string dominated this album. You can hear the subtleties of the low B.\"During the rest of the chat, Rob revealed that he did use an ESP bass for a few parts on the record, stressing that the Warwick still pretty much epitomizes the \"Hardwired\" bass parts.So the instrument in question is the Rob Trujillo signature 5-string Warwick bass strung with Dunlop Trujilo Icon Series .045-.130 strings and loaded with with EMG pickups hooked up with Bartolini preamps. The amps Rob rocked during the recording sessions are the Ampeg SVT-CL, Ampeg SVT-IIPRO, and Ampeg SV-810E.If you want to hear the mighty W in action, check out the clip below.
