DeMille award at the GGs tonight and her introduction was some Tony Award-worthy shit. Viola delivered several layers of THEATER! I wondered how Meryl Streep herself was going to follow that up, and then she went up to the mic and snatched the road kill carcass on Donald Trump’s head without even saying his name.\nMeryl defended outsiders, foreigners and the press while she had the mic . She spent a piece of her speech eloquently calling out Jabba the Trump for making fun of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski , who is disabled, and for trying to stick a muzzle on the mouths of the press. Meryl said that the performance that stuck in her head the most last year was Trump making fun of Serge’s disability and it hurt her heart.\n“There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good. There was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter, someone he outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it. I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life.\nAnd this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.”\nAnd then she said this about protecting the press:\n‘This brings me to the press. We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage. That’s why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in our constitution. So I only ask the famously well-heeled Hollywood Foreign Press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the committee to protect journalists. Because we’re going to need them going forward. And they’ll need us to safeguard the truth.’\nAfter Meryl did that, I thought that everyone else who won afterward was going to just say, “ Err, yeah, what Meryl said, ” and walk off.\nAt tonight's #GoldenGlobes we honor Hollywood legend Meryl Streep with the prestigious Cecil B. Demille Award. pic.twitter.com/dxpeCDNXY6\n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017\nTrump’s team is probably going to spend the rest of the night trying to hide his phone from him so he won’t tweet about how the failing Meryl Streep is overrated was only fuckable in the 70s. One staffer is going to hide his phone down the front of her pants, which will make another staffer scream, “Don’t hide it there! That’s the first place he’s going to grab! ”\nPics : Getty", "external_links": ["https://t.co/dxpeCDNXY6", "https://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/goldenglobes/status/818295979182960640", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/watch-meryl-streep-accept-cecil-b-demille-award-golden-globes-2017-961510", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenGlobes?src=hash"], "published": "2017-01-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T06:51:06.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
