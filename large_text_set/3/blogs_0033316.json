Splash News Diego Maradona is ready to take action against Konami after using his face without permission Konami 8 The gaming company Konami are in hot water after using Maradona’s face illegally in their game PES 17 \nHe even went as far as placing a screenshot of himself on the game online, clearly depicting the footballing legend in his younger years with large, curly black hair. \nMaradona’s anger with Konami was first raised by Kotaku , highlighting that the 97-rated player in the game’s “Legends” section was clearly the former Barcelona and Napoli great. Times Newspapers Ltd Konami have copied the younger image of Maradona with the long black curly hair which he maintained throughout most of his career Getty Images 8 Maradona is arguably most famous for the ‘Hand of God’ goal where he handled the ball past Peter Shilton in 1986 \nThey even revealed that Konami have attempted to use his features in secret on the game in the past, giving the football character the name “Malgini”. \nAs a result, Maradona has previously won compensation from Konami for using his likeness under a pseudonym without legal permission. Getty Images The Argentine legend is regarded as one of the greatest players ever Reuters 8 Maradona is ready to take legal action against Konami once more for their lack of communication with him \nBut on this occasion, rather bizarrely, Konami have decided to use the retired international’s official name, despite still not having permission, which could land them in hot water once more. \nThis could be highlighted further should their gaming rivals FIFA 17 decide to go ahead and legally use Maradona in their game after agreeing terms with the Argentine recently. Getty Images Maradona’s involvement with Barcelona could save Konami from losing further money in legal battles Getty Images 8 Thierry Henry was a part of the PES 17 trailer that has included several other Barcelona legends \nHowever, PES 17 could be saved after Konami are reported to have signed a deal with Barcelona in 2016 to have several of the club’s legends, and Maradona would surely count as one. \nThis claim could be cast aside though, as Diego does not appear in the trailer for this new feature of the game, instead showing the likes of Thierry Henry , Marc Overmars, Patrick Kluivert and Gary Lineker.
