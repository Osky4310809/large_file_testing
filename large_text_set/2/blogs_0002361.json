This entry shook up the classic LBP formula by introducing multiple playable characters with different abilities, allowing for greater variety in the action. Back in November 2014, Matt Helgeson gave the game a solid 8.5 review score . \nHere's the full list of February's PS Plus offerings: LittleBigPlanet 3, PS4 Starwhal, PS3 (Cross Buy on PS4) Anna: Extended Edition, PS3 Ninja Senki DX, Vita (Cross Buy on PS4) TorqueL, Vita (Cross Buy on PS4) \nThese deals go live on February 7th, which means you have until then to pick up last month's games , which include Day of the Tentacle Remastered and This War of Mine: The Little Ones. \n[Source: Playstation Blog ] \nEmail the author , or follow on Game Informer .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T21:42:24.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
