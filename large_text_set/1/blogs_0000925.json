Shkreli, who already teased portions of the highly-anticipated release, shared in a video released earlier today how he came to allegedly obtain the material. \nShkreli claims he bought the music from an unnamed party (that he assumed was a hacker) who reached out to him, and says he thinks the sale is legally legit. “I believe that the sale is legal,” he said. “Criminal law? Forget it … I don’t believe that Lil Wayne could sue me. I don’t believe Birdman can sue me. I don’t think Universal could sue me. It’s a legal sale.” \nThe so-called “Pharma Bro” joined DJ Akademiks for a nearly two-hour chat where the two covered a ton of ground, including the infamous unreleased Wu-Tang Clan album, Once Upon A Time In Shaolin . After some tough talk between the two, the conversation shifted into Shkreli’s legal issues and his connection to Bobby Shmurda . But it was the chatter around Lil Wayne’s music where things got heated. \n“I do have what I believe to be a two-CD, authentic, Carter V final product mixed down,” said Shkreli. “Nobody knows what Tha Carter V is. If fact, nobody can say until Lil Wayne says, ‘This is Tha Carter V . He’s controlling it. If he says, ‘You know what? That two-CD thing that Martin has? I’m gonna add some stuff. I’m gonna take a track off and put in five more.’ If he says that’s Tha Carter V , then that’s Tha Carter V, it’s his call.” \nThere had been some back and forth between Shkreli and DJ Akademiks this past week, with the beleaguered pharmaceutical entrepreneur issuing threats via video just days ago . \nWatch the interview above. The discussion around Tha Carter V starts around the nine-minute mark. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
