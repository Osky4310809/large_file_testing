Grivko accused the German of bullying him and a teammate at an earlier point in the race, putting the crowd of cyclists at risk for a crash at high speed (would’ve also been fun, but alas). \nNow Kittel, who won the Tour of Dubai in 2016, is demanding that Grivko be banned from the sport for 6 months, which seems like a stupendous overreaction, but also the perfect thing to take this feud deep into 2017. You can check out the video below for footage of Kittel oozing blood from his eye mid-ride, but in the meantime, hope with us that cycling continues to evolve as the world’s premier action athletic realm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:42:56.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
