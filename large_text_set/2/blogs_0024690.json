By Erin Strout   2:02 pm The New Jersey-New York Track Club set a new indoor world record for the 4 x 1 mile relay. Victah Sailer \nThe New Jersey-New York Track Club made the indoor track season a bit more entertaining on Friday by going for the 4 x 1 mile relay world record, held by the New York Athletic Club since 1993. The group of Donn Cabral, Ford Palmer, Graham Crawford, and Kyle Merber took home the record by three seconds in 16:12.81, though it wasnâ€™t as speedy as they had hoped. \nCrawford, just coming back from injury, was a last-minute substitute for original teammate Colby Alexander, who withdrew last week. With four men coming in with mile times under four minutes, the goal of breaking 16 minutes seemed plausible, but without direct competition it turned out to be too difficult to keep the necessary pace.
