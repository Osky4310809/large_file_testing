He’d been immaculate for two months, they give him the Nobel Peace Prize,” Limbaugh said. “They gave it to him on the come. They thought, ‘Oh, my God, this is great. We got a guy here, we got the Prince of Peace right here in the White House in the United States of America.’ Well, there’s some stats.” Advertisement - story continues below CNN Claims FBI Director Briefed Trump On Secret Dossier \nLimbaugh then revealed the cold hard facts for Obama supporters. \n“Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Hussein Obama will leave office as the first — are you ready for this? — the first two-term president in all of American history to have been at war every day of his presidency,” Limbaugh quipped. “It just doesn’t get any better than this stuff that’s happening.” \nObama came into office with the promise of ending the wars of predecessor, George W. Bush, but as the New York Times reports, he has now been at war longer than Bush or any other American president.

They thought Obama was gonna unite the world and bring peace everywhere and love and all this stuff, community organizing around the world,” he said. “He was gonna bring newfound peace, great relations, and, instead, he ends up the first two-term president in history to have been at war — wait a minute, it gets even better — to have been at war every day.” \nAccording to an analysis of Defense Department Data from the Council on Foreign Relations, a non-partisan think tank, Obama will depart the White House having dropped 26,171 bombs on foreign countries around the world last year, or 3,027 more than 2015, \nA majority of the bombs were dropped in Iraq (12,192) and Syria (12,095).
