But Pochettino was more forthcoming. Tottenham expect Danny Rose to return from knee injury in early April \nThe Tottenham manager said Lamela’s off-field issues were no longer affecting his progress, insisting that the hip injury was the only problem holding him back. \nBut when asked how much longer Lamela might be absent, Pochettino replied: “I don’t want to lie to you and give some information that after you use, you are right to use. \n\"I can’t say one week, two weeks, three weeks, one month or maybe next season. I don’t know.
