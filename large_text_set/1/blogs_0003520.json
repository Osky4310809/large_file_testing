Beyond extending the joy of painting to millions who might otherwise have never thought themselves capable, Bob taught us to believe in ourselves, in the amazing power hidden in each and every soul. He understood the value of different perspectives, and encouraged all of his viewers to embrace their own unique humanity. He recognized the importance of both tragedy and beauty in the context of life as well as nature. \nBeyond all this, Bob Ross was one of the kindest, gentlest spirits to ever grace our TV screens. For as long as he could, he worked to make this world a prettier place, one painting at a time. For that, I will always look up to him. \nHappy painting, Bob, and God bless.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T06:53:29.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
