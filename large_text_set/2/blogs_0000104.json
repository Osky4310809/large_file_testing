It was about a year ago when the model was first spotted in a pair of Stuart Weitzmans pulled up over skinny jeans , and since then she’s sported her now-signature shoe with everything from ribbed sweater dresses to denim cutoffs . Clearly, the all-occasion style is an accessory worth investing in. But for many, the steep price tag is enough to give the whole idea, well, the boot. And understandably so. Which is why we’ve pinpointed 23 alternatives to help you dip a toe into the trend without digging too deep into your pockets. \nFeaturing lace-up closures and a block heel, Dune’s Sibyl boots will stack up next to Hadid’s, while setting you back just $115. Flat devotees can get a leg up on the look with Toga’s stretch-leather Pulla boots, which boast Western-inspired buckled hardware. Looking to take the trend into a totally new direction? Try on Giuseppe Zanotti’s Melissa for size in rich chocolate brown with gold metal detail. And considering they’re marked at $275 (down from $1,128), they’re a stylish steal. In other words, run—don’t walk—to shop these and others in the slideshow above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:35:04.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
