Share By Dave Masters Emmeline Saunders 23:18, 30 JAN 2017 Get celebs   Thank you for subscribing!   \nGrab your sonic screwdriver and join us on a journey into the future as we predict who will be the next Doctor Who . \nThe Mirror reported this week that Peter Capaldi is set to step down in 2017 after the next series - news he confirmed tonight after paying tribute to the show. \nAnd now the chase is on to find his successor to become the 13th Doctor in the programme's 53-year history. \nBookies at William Hill have offered former Doctors Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith at respective odds of 33/1, 20/1 and 16/1, while Harry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are tipped at 33/1 and 8/1 each. Read More Ben Whishaw has become a frontrunner for the role (Photo: Sony Pictures) He has been starring as Q in recent James Bond films (Photo: Handout) \nBut it's James Bond star Ben Whishaw who's looking the most likely right now, with William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams saying: \"Ben looks a banker at the minute but there is a little bit of cash about for a return of a former Doctor.\" \nBen is offered at 5/1. \nBut Doctor Who fans have been getting their multi-coloured Tom Baker tribute scarves in a twist trying to figure it out since the news broke this week. \nNobody has a clue whom new writer Chris Chibnall, the creator of Broadchurch , will pick to launch his era at the reins of the longest-running sci-fi show ever. (Photo: BBC) \nSome believe a Hollywood star could take up the mantle, while others think it's time for a female star to land the top job. \nSo, in a bid to help sort the Time Lords from the time wasters, we've set ourselves the intergalactically tough task of analysing all of the data to reveal who is most likely to get the nod. Forget exter-min-ate... it's time to est-i-mate! Who are the bookies tipping for the TARDIS? \nThere are more runners and riders in this one than the Grand National. But Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes concurs with other bookies and confirms there's already a frontrunner. \n\"Fingers are firmly pointing at Ben Whishaw,\" she said. \"He's favourite to swap MI6 for the TARDIS sooner rather than later.\" \nBelow is the full list of odds... Ben Whishaw 5/1 Damian Lewis 50/1 The search is on...so who's getting Googled the most? \nHollywood stars dominate the top two spots, with Helena Bonham Carter and Idris Elba pulling in the most traffic. \nBonham Carter doesn't have too many films in the pipeline according to her IMBD, so her search volumes may suggest a new role in Doctor Who could be in the pipeline. \nIdris Elba's work elsewhere is also likely to play a part - especially as he's linked to potentially playing the next James Bond . \nAside from those two, Ben Whishaw tops the pile as the best of the rest. He's followed by Miranda Hart and Richard Ayoade. What's the average actor's age? (Photo: BBC) \nForty-one is the average age actors start as the Doctor. \nCurrent Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi , was 55 when he began filming the role - making him the joint oldest in the history of the show. He's tied with the first-ever Doctor, William Hartnell. \nMatt Smith was the youngest actor to step onto the set at just 27. \nOf our list of hopefuls, bookies' favourite Ben Whishaw is 35 at the moment, so would be 36 by the time the part arrived - the same age as eighth Doctor Paul McGann was when he got the job. \nRichard Ayoade would be 39, Rory Kinnear 38 and Miranda Hart 44. Hollywood's Idris Elba would be 44, while Helena Bonham Carter would have turned 50 - the same age third Doctor John Pertwee was when he got the job. Is it time for a woman to take the lead?

Rowan Atkinson , Richard E. Grant , Jim Broadbent and Hugh Grant all featured. \nFemale characters have traditionally played the Doctor's brave side-kicks, and one of the best known was Sarah Jane (played by the late Elisabeth Sladen, below). She originally starred opposite Jon Pertwee and then Tom Baker, before returning for a cameo during David Tennant's tenure. (Photo: BBC) \nHer return proved so popular BBC bosses commissioned her to star in the Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures from 2007. So...we believe the next Doctor Who will be played by.... (Photo: BBC) \nYes, Miranda Hart gets our vote as the next Doctor Who. She's almost the perfect age, the bookies fancy her as second favourite female and she has a lot of experience being surrounded by doctors in TV's Call The Midwife . \nMiranda is also the top-searched UK female star on our list and she's a fan of wearing Doctor Who-style scarves, as shown below. (Photo: BBC) \nThe comic also topped a fan poll the last time a new Doctor needed to be found, beating former show favourite Billie Piper to the top spot. \nAfter being told fans wanted to see her in the TARDIS, she told Heat: \"Really? Who, me? Are you serious? That's hilarious! \n\"I didn't watch it when I was younger - it scared me. I started watching some Doctor Who recently on my own and got too scared. I had to watch it in the daytime - I'm pathetic. \n\"I might be alright if I'm in it, though, and I don't have to watch it.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:43:46.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
