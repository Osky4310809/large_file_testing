Elsewhere, Eminem put Kendrick Lamar’s pen game to the test and apparently just about everyone in Hip Hop wants to box each other. Meek Mill & The L’s \nA rundown of the L’s Meek Mill took this week includes him epically bailing on the icy stairs at his mama’s crib and porn star Mia Khalifa clowning him and the Philadelphia 76ers on Instagram (though that was quickly diffused by Joel Embiid ). It was also reported that his breakup with Nicki Minaj by him wanting to spend time with his homeboys instead of her on their trip to Turks & Caicos. \nOh, and also he offered to box Drake for a check, floating the idea of putting his ex up to be the ring card girl for the match. \n“Y’all would come and see that fight wouldn’t y’all?” Meek mused in a Facebook Live video that exploded across the internet. “Y’all would pay $100 a ticket for that.” \nRead more here . Eminem Pen Checks Kendrick Lamar \nA pretty cool story about Eminem testing Kendrick Lamar’s verse-writing ability popped up this past week, thanks to “Shape Of You” singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. \nIn an interview with the Zach Sang Show , Sheeran recounted the story that Em invited K. Dot over to record a track and asked that he leave his entourage at the door and enter the studio alone. It was just the two MCs and an engineer. \nThe Compton, California rap star wrote a sick verse that eventually became “Love Game” off The Marshall Mathers LP 2. \n“Eminem said that he did it to test Kendrick because he thought he had a ghostwriter,” Sheeran revealed. “He then realized that he didn’t, and then claimed he was the best, which is kinda cool, I think.” \nRead more here . Hip Hop Celebrity Deathmatch In Real Life \nSo now, it seems that everyone in Hip Hop is trying to get the bag for boxing it out with their nemesis. \nIt all started with Soulja Boy and Chris Brown announcing their plans to box in Dubai (or LA, or Vegas, who knows anymore) and now we’re down a rabbit hole of potential possibilities for more boxing matches that could rack in millions. Easy money play for all. \nAnd then, Meek Mill said he’d fight Drake for $5 million . \nWhile these rappers are prepping to be in the role of a boxer, Mike Tyson is seeing what life is like on the other side with his recently recorded diss song toward Soulja Boy. Yes, that happened. \nRead more here . DXclusives: Harvey J & Tre Capital \nHarvey J cleverly used Hennessy to curate his “Hennessy Chicken” music video and then he went viral. \n“Hennessy chose me,” he asserts in an exclusive interview with HipHopDX’s Ural Garrett. \nElsewhere, Tre Capital spoke with DX’s Victoria Hernandez about paving his own way while recording his We Must Do Better album. \nThe Los Angeles rapper has 11 tracks on the project that he created to speak and connect with his fans. \n“L et me really make sure that I’m putting in the effort and the time to talk about the relationship with my family and how I felt discouraged trying to be a bigger role model for them,” he says. “My brother or my sister or friends around me or just music. Combining all of those topics and putting it into perspective of saying man, fans are so geeked to hear this album because it’s refreshing.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
