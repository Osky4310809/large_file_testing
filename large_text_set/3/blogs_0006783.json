And then I read about women like Nikita Singh, one of India’s bestselling authors, already a writer of 10 novels, who just finished a book tour across the country. What starts with a hint of jealously in me, fades into pride for the lady, and a deep motivation to do more! A Potterhead, Nikita started writing at the age of 19 when most of us were too busy deciding whether we wanted to eat McDonalds or Dominos. It was after reading a, what she calls, “shitty” book and a dare from her younger sister that made her write her first novel, Love@Facebook. Rest, as we know, is history. Just this month, on March 1, she released her 10th book, Every Time It Rains. \n(Source- Instagram) \nWith love and romance being the central theme of most of her novels, we would expect the product to be something on the lines of mushy and erotic Mills and Boons . The case, however, is not even close. The characters she portrays are too real to be true. With ambition-driven and passionate characters, the men and women in her books live in the world of Tinder, Instagram and, sadly, Trump. She wrote Right Here, Right Now, which deals with a woman who loses her memory and tries to build a new life from scratch. Another one, After All This Time , dealt with the life of an HIV positive woman. The reality of her novels is hard hitting, and sets her apart from her contemporaries who are too busy writing about a utopian world, where the only endings are happy endings! Born and raised in small towns of Bihar and Jharkhand, Nikita had a rather sheltered childhood and faced all the regular small-town-girl restrictions. What worked well, however, was the fact that both her parents are avid readers and had a collection of over 12000 books in their own house. We should have seen this coming! (Source- Instagram) Just after her first book, Nikita collaborated with Durjoy Dutta, another young and very talented writer, for two of his novels and together these two came up with some of their best work, in the form of If It's Not Forever... It's Not Love and Someone Like You. In fact, Nikita also works as an editor for Durjoy’s own venture, Grapevine India. If this wasn’t enough, Nikita is currently pursuing master's degree in creative writing from The New School, New York City and even working as a fashion stylist for a brand called J.Crew. A recipient of the Live India Young Achievers Award, in 2013, she is a regular TedX speaker and one of highest selling Indian authors in fiction. All of this may be too far for me to achieve, but there is one thing we both do connect on, Ranveer Singh. Much like us, Nikita too believes that she is married to the hunky Bollywood Star. I feel you girl, I feel you.
