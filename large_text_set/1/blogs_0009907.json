Lauderdale Airport massacre suggest that the shooter, Esteban Santiago, is a Muslim convert who years ago took on the Islamic name Aashiq Hammad.\nAccording to a Judicial Watch report , Santiago/Hammad downloaded terrorist propaganda and recorded Islamic religious music online, suggesting a serious commitment to Islam years before he joined the U.S. Army.\nThe public records uncovered in the days after the massacre suggest Santiago (Hammad) is a radical Islamic terrorist that’s seriously committed to Islam. Besides taking on a Muslim name, he recorded three Islamic religious songs, including the Muslim declaration [of] faith (“there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger”) known as the Shahada. He also posted a thread about downloading propaganda videos from Islamic terrorists on a weapons and explosives forum. The investigative news site that unearthed this disturbing information connected the dots between Santiago, who is of Puerto Rican descent, and Hammad, an identity he created in 2007.\nIndeed, it has been several days since the news site \"Got News \" uncovered the publicly available information, but the official story from authorities is that the gunman is a mentally ill Hispanic Army veteran who was suffering from PTSD after his tour in Iraq.\nFort Lauderdale Shooter Flew From Alaska With Gun Checked in Luggage\nWe believe we have identified #EstebanSantiago .
