Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \nAlaska leaned on Calvin Abueva and Vic Manuel to outlast Star, 97-90, in overtime in the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday night at Smart Araneta Coliseum. \nAbueva and Manuel combined for 48 points and 17 rebounds for the Aces, who moved into joint third place with a 4-3 record. \n“You can’t take away all their (Star) threats. They’re too good. I’m just so happy to escape with a win against a team that is that good,” said Alaska head coach Alex Compton. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Calvin and Vic were the obvious heroes in this game. Their energy carried us and they were tremendous,” added Compton, who also commended Tony dela Cruz and Jaypee Mendoza. \nThe Aces squandered a nine-point lead, 83-74, they built with 5:55 left in regulation as the Hotshots closed the fourth quarter on a 12-3 run capped by a 3-pointer by Allein Maliksi that extended the game into OT, 86-all, with 1:21 to go. \nAbueva scored 10 points in the fourth and extra periods, including a basket underneath off a turnover that made it, 93-89, with 1:09 remaining in OT. \nHe finished with 23 points, nine rebounds and four steals while Manuel collected 25 points and eight rebounds. \nMaliksi led Star with 15 points on 6-of-16 shooting from the field and nine rebounds, but missed his last five shots after his triple that tied the game at 88.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T17:51:50.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
