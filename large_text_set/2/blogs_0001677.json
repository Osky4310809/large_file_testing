But the attempt to send him back failed after the authorities there refused to recognise him as a citizen. \nOn Wednesday, police in Frankfurt arrested a 36-year-old Tunisian man who was allegedly planning a terror attack in Germany for the militant group Isis. \nHe was also alleged to have taken part in attacks in Tunisia, including on the Bardo National Museum in Tunis in March 2015 that killed 20 people, and a suspected assault by Isis militants on the town of Ben Guerdane close to Tunisia’s border with Libya in March 2016 in which 13 soldiers and seven civilians died. \nPolice said the suspect was a recruiter and trafficker for Isis and had built up a support network for the group inside Germany. He had allegedly come to Germany in August 2015 as an asylum seeker, but had previously lived in the country, between 2003 and April 2013.

But he was released in early November, because the Tunisians had failed to provide the necessary papers to allow him to be sent back. Since then, police said, he had been under round-the-clock observation. \nThe case closely resembles that of Amri, who could also not be sent back to Tunisia because the authorities there refused to provide the necessary ID papers. The Big Read Berlin attack exposes serious failings in the way intelligence services deal with suspects Wednesday, 1 February, 2017 \nWednesday’s arrest was part of a series of raids involving 1,100 police, during which 54 flats, business premises and mosques were searched. \nThree men were also arrested in Berlin, suspected of plotting a terrorist attack. German media reported that two of them had a connection to Amri. Like Amri, the suspects often prayed at the Fussilet mosque in Berlin, which is known as a meeting place for Islamists. \nThe tagging proposal had been agreed by justice minister Heiko Maas and interior minister Thomas de Maizière last month as part of a package of measures to beef up security. \nMr de Maizière said tags were “no silver bullet” but were an “important instrument, to make it easier to monitor people”. \nThe tag is a GPS transmitter attached to the leg which emits a signal when a suspect approaches a prohibited zone. \nThe DPA news agency said there were currently 88 people convicted of sex crimes or crimes of violence in Germany who have been released from prison and are wearing tags. But so far they have never been used for potential terrorists. Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
