Instead of treating it like the peaceful transfer of power between US presidents, the paper went in a slightly different direction. \nYep, you read that right. The paper is describing Friday‚Äôs even as a return broadcast of The Twilight Zone , calling it ‚Äúone of the most ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history.‚Äù \nIn his characterization, Herald reviewer Damien Love also satirically noted that the ‚Äústory begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president.‚Äù \nIt ends by calling it a ‚Äúflawed piece‚Äù that gives a ‚Äúdisturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into.‚Äù \nAs one would expect, there was quite a bit of reaction online, with even the Herald publishing a piece on it. The Sunday Herald TV Section wins today. pic.twitter.com/OanCZdznGJ \n‚Äî George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) January 15, 2017 The TV Guide listing for Trump's inauguration in Scotland's Sunday Herald is amazing. #twilightzone üòÇ pic.twitter.com/fwUPMQ0Mw0 \n‚Äî Elizabeth Tulloch (@BitsieTulloch) January 15, 2017 On a lighter note (sort of) Scotland's Sunday Herald synopsis of Friday's Inauguration is BRILLIANT.
