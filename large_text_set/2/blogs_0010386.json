SPIED: DS7 seen undisguised; autonomous tech? / 1 comment \nJust as the upcoming DS 7 has been spotted undergoing winter testing, images of a completely undisguised example has surfaced ahead of its expected official debut at this year’s Geneva Motor Show, courtesy of Citroen fan blog Citronfeng . \nIt appears to draw design cues from the Citroen Wild Rubis concept at the 2013 Shanghai Motor Show, and is set to go head-to-head with German premium contenders such as the Audi Q5 , BMW X3 and the Mercedes-Benz GLC . \nRiding on Groupe PSA’s EMP2 platform which already underpins the likes of the Peugeot 308 , Citroen C4 Picasso and Grand C4 Picasso , the upcoming DS 7 will be the crowning model in the brand’s line-up, and it wears a design theme distinct from the DS 3 , DS 4 and DS 5 model lines. \nWhen it arrives on the market, the upcoming DS 7 SUV is expected to be the technology benchmark for Groupe PSA; as shown by another leaked image above, it suggests the DS 7 will feature a certain level of autonomous technology. It is also set to be the group’s first product to be sold with the new 1.5 litre diesel DVR engine and its first plug-in hybrid powertrain, according to a report by Autocar . At the top of the range, a Performance model is expected to come with around 240 bhp. \nThe DS range is also expected to spearhead more advancements further down the line; the enxt-generation DS 3 and its equivalent SUV are expected to spawn all-electric powertrains, which will be the first to be built on the new CMP platform that is being developed with partner and part-owner, Dongfeng, the report added. \n“We are not worried by selling fewer cars, as long as profits are rising. You cannot build a premium brand overnight and you cannot build it by selling high volumes of cars at high discounts. We have a job to do, and if that means reducing volumes slightly, that is okay,” Groupe PSA chief Carlos Tavares told Autocar . \nGALLERY: Citroen DS Wild Rubis concept Related Cars for Sale on", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:57:16.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
