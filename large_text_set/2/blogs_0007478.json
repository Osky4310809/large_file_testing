According to Portugal’s Correrio de Mahna , after hearing 80 dogs were in need, the 32-year-old star sent a signed jersey to the kennel to help raise money.

When the striker transferred from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2009, he appeared as happy to be able to have dogs again as he was about his pay bump. \n“I’ve always liked having dogs, but it was impossible in Manchester,” Ronaldo said in a video profile that was uploaded to YouTube in 2011. “It was just too cold, and my house wasn’t suitable either.” \nRonaldo, who has housed at least two dogs and a cat in Madrid, added, “They lighten up the house and bring me a lot of joy.” A photo posted by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) on Aug 6, 2016 at 10:11am PDT A photo posted by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) on Aug 12, 2015 at 3:28am PDT \nRonaldo, a frequent contributor to charity, is global ambassador for Save the Children. In December, he made a “generous donation” to the organization to go toward providing food, clothing and medical care for families in Syria.
