Why? Because chairman Bill Ford knows how much people suck at driving.

Although I would say they had better be autonomous. Most people can’t drive two dimensions. let alone three.\n“There are entrepreneurs who are working on flying vehicles. I haven’t been in one, but seen a test of one. And they are technically going to be very possible.\n“But go back to automation. Think about today, planes, which you to take off and land at the airport, which eliminates 99% of their usefulness. You have to be a licensed pilot. Well, how many of those are there?\n“But in time, regulations change and these things start to become more interesting. So I wouldn’t say never for us, but not in the short term for us.”﻿\n\nHe’s not wrong! As cool as I think it’d be to go for a fly through the countryside, and as I excited I am at the prospect of bringing the Mustang name back to an aircraft, I know just how imperfect I am, and just how bad everybody else is when it comes to operating normal cars. \nOf course there’s way more space to play around up there... but that just means there will be people playing around up there!
