What do cracked nuts have to do with anything? Is Carol baking another batch of cookies? What about the rubber ducks? Or the melons? Is Negan going to smash them like he did Glenn’s head? There’s also a lantern, bundle of dynamite (it’s worth noting that peanuts can be used to make dynamite), a bike, an upside-down bucket, a bloody handprint, a decaying corpse and lone walker with a grocery cart, a shallow grave, and shadows, which one Walking Dead fan notes that “if you look at it upside down [you’ll] see they are wearing armor like the kingdom people. Its the kingdom. Right side shadow is Ezekiel.” \nThere are no captions for the photos, only a general statement for the album (and season) as a whole : “Worlds collide. Prepare to rise up and fight Sunday, Feb. 12,” which is when the show returns. Have a look at the posters below, and make your own wild speculations. I’ll start: the ducks obviously mean the Kingdom will take out Negan’s crew using the Flying V .
