What does it really comprise of? Romance? Endless conversation? Sleepless nights? Long drives and late night walks? Blind trust? Great sex? Maybe all of these things, maybe some of these things, or maybe, none of these things, depending on who is answering. \nBut, if there's something about love that all of us unanimously would agree on, it is that when done right, it is our safe place, where we feel accepted, where we feel 'at home.' \nThere is a reason behind this analogy that we have for love and lovers, the kind that make us feel fulfilled. We say that it feels like home when we are with the love of our lives, because, maybe, it is. We recreate the love that we receive at home, from our families, and the most instrumental are our parents. They are the ones who lay the foundation for who and how we love in the future. \nOur parents accept us, with all our quirks and flaws. They see our shortcomings, and help us work through them, and if we can't, they accept them as a part of the deal. They are dedicated to making us better versions of ourselves, as if that's their sole purpose in life - that we, their children, should be the best we can. \nThey negotiate the terms of contract with us, repeatedly helping us reach the middle ground, something that works for all of us. We learn the supremely crucial skill of reaching win-win solutions to our problems from our parents, because at the end of the day, they do have our best interest at heart. \nOf course, sometimes we fight. There are times when we can't stand to be around each other, when our humanness becomes bigger than being a child or a parent. But, our parents teach us that no fight and no disagreement is big enough to give up on someone you love. Everything can be worked through, if you are willing, and try hard enough.
