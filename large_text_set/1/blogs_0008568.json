Just before the crash Ms Murray-Woodford texted husband Ben Kelly-Taylor to say she would be “leaving soon\" \nMr Kelly-Taylor today told of his devastation at losing his “genuine and compassionate” wife six months after they married on his grandmother’s farm in his native Australia. \nHe said: “Laura was an outgoing person.

She deserved better than she got. \n“A lot of people think their loved ones are special but in this case it really was true. I fell more in love with Laura as time went on and loved being her boyfriend and husband. \n“We had a really short amount of time together once we had married but we had been together six years. \n“She had no reservations or doubt when she smiled – you could see she shone through. She was the same through and through – genuine and compassionate.
