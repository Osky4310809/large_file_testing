The dog clawed at the edge of the pool before being finally pushed and submerged in the water. Once there, the dog struggled to stay afloat until a voice yelled “cut” and handlers rushed to pull the dog out of the water.

Bruce Cameron’s 2010 novel about a dog who learns his purpose as he is reincarnated into various dogs over the course of several lifetimes. It is produced by Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is slated to be released Jan. 27. \nRead original story PETA Urges ‘Dog’s Purpose’ Boycott, Says Pooch Was Terrorized  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:18:24.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
