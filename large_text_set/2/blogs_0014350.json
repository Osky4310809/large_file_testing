Durkin | 8:05   \nIt would appear as if President Donald Trump ‘s longstanding argument that CNN is the home of “fake news” has officially permeated other members of the Republican party. \nIowa Congressman Steve King appeared on that very network Wednesday morning and suggested to New Day anchor Alisyn Camerota point blank that any notion of Kremlin interference with the general election was simply a figment of CNN’s imagination. \nThe subject was brought up after a tweet early this morning by Trump , who attempted to loosely tie together “[t]his Russian connection non-sense” to “Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.” \nIn response, Congressman King offered, “I think it’s a CNN narrative that the allegations that the Russians were trying to influence the US election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ,” King offered (sic). \n“Hold on a minute! CNN didn’t invent this!” exclaimed Camerota in response. “As you know, there was a score of intelligence agencies — seventeen of them — that concluded that Russia had hacked and meddled in our election.” \n“Alisyn, there was dissent among that,” King said in return, indicating that the reports from the intel community were purely opinion-based with no factual or anecdotal evidence to support it. \n“Just so I’m clear Congressman: you do not believe that Russia meddled ?” Camerota asked. \nCongressman King returned serve by saying simply, “I don’t know. I don’t have — I don’t know if they meddled or not. I want to see a transcript; I was to hear some audio.” \nWatch above via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:10:21.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
