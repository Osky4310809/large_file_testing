The daughter of late pop star Michael Jackson is set to make her acting debut on Lee Daniels' girl group drama Star, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Jackson will play Rachel Wells, a young, super-chic, stylish and intimidating social media guru who oversees a publicity shoot of the girl group and deliberately goads Eva and Star into pushing some boundaries. She is slated to appear in one episode. The casting comes as little surprise. Rolling Stone recently revealed in a cover story about Jackson that Daniels was talking to her manager about a role on the show after Jackson charmed the prolific producer, who is also a co-creator on Empire. Like Empire, Star has been able to an impressive list of musical talents, including Gladys Knight, Naomi Campbell and Lenny Kravitz, among others. In the eight years since her father's sudden death in 2009, Jackson has made limited TV appearances, including a 2012 episode of Oprah's Next Chapter and an appearance on Ellen the year prior. Her Rolling Stone cover marked her first-ever in-depth interview. In addition to her acting aspirations, Jackson has dropped multiple videos of her own performances online, hinting at a possible future in music. Jackson is repped by Stiefel Entertainment. Star airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T05:43:18.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
