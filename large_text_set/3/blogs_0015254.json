It’s your chance to rant and rave (or both) about any retirement issue. Send your comments to colorofmoney@washpost.com. Please include your name, city and state. In the subject line put “Retirement Rants & Raves.” \nClaudia Ruddy of Florida shared how downsizing has shaped her and her husband’s early retirement. They didn’t have children but lived in a five-bedroom home in St. Petersburg. They had a lawn, cleaning and pool service. \n“We agreed in our 50s we would move upon retirement to a small, pool-less house in a beach community with the goal of reducing our expenses to travel as much as possible,” she wrote. “We expected to work until 66. \nBut plans change. Her husband was laid off at 60. They moved to a modest two-bedroom home in Ormond by the Sea. \n“The location does not require flood insurance and our property tax decreased by almost two-thirds,” she said. “Instead of the monthly $188 and $210 bills for sewer, water and electricity, we pay $100 for electricity and $30 for water. (Admittedly we do now have the task of pumping the septic tank every two years.) We still pay someone to cut the grass, but I can clean the whole house in a couple hours. I do miss the pool, but being able to walk to the beach is great. We found we could live nicely (traveling the U.S. every couple months and Europe for a month once a year) on a combination of part-time work and our pensions. No doubt having children or having strong ties to the more expensive area would make moving harder for many people, but it has certainly worked for us. We joke we should send my husband’s former employer a thank-you letter.” \nMark Dziewit of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., wanted to shared his thoughts on a Fidelity Investments retirement IQ test that I wrote about in last week’s newsletter . \nOn the question on how much some financial experts recommend people save by the time they retire, he wrote, “I don’t know (or care) how much so called experts say one should save as a multiple of your last year’s income. I do know that if I have a sum of money and I assume a 3 percent real annual return less my withdrawals, I can play with the variables to know what is needed to achieve a certain level of ‘income.'” \nOn the question about the average monthly Social Security benefit benefit paid in 2016, he wrote, “I know it’s not much. It only matters in the context that this ‘not much’ amount is what many of my fellow citizens will need to live on. Not good for them, not good for the country.” \n“I think this test was not very useful,” Dziewit said. “However, for some it could get them thinking. So much info from experts is simplistic or just wrong. Thank you for this opportunity to ‘rant.’” \nLet me remind you of all the questions for the retirement IQ test. 1. Roughly how much do many financial experts recommend people save by the time they retire? a. About 2-3 times the amount of your last full year income b. About 4-5 times the amount of your last full year income c. About 6-7 times the amount of your last full year income d. About 8-9 times the amount of your last full year income e. About 10-12 times the amount of your last full year income \n2. Stock markets go up and down. How often over the past 35 years do you think the market has had a positive annual return? a. The annual return was positive fewer than 12 out of 35 years b. The annual return was positive about 12 out of 35 years c. The annual return was positive about 18 out of 35 years d. The annual return was positive about 26 out of 35 years e. The annual return was positive more than 26 out of 35 years \n3. If you were able to set aside $50 each month for retirement, how much would that end up becoming 25 years from now, including interest if it grew at the historical stock market average? a.
