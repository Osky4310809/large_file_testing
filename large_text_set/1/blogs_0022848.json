REUTERS/Mike Brown\nVICTORIA, Texas (AP) â€” An early-morning fire has destroyed a Texas mosque that had been a target of hatred in the past.\nThe Victoria Advocate reports that a convenience store clerk spotted smoke and flames billowing from the Islamic Center of Victoria at around 2 a.m. Saturday and called the fire department.\nJeff Cowan, battalion chief for the city's fire department, says firefighters and police officers found the mosque completely consumed in flames when they arrived.\nThe blaze was extinguished about four hours later. No injuries have been reported.\nVictoria Fire Marshal Tom Legler has asked for help from state and federal fire investigators to determine what caused the blaze.\nThe Islamic center's president, Shahid Hashmi, wouldn't speculate about whether it was arson, but he says the building was burglarized a week ago. The paper reports that in July 2013, a man admitted to painting \"H8,\" a computer shorthand for \"hate,\" on the outside of the building.\nThe mosque has a congregation of 100 members. Victoria is about 115 miles southwest of Houston.\n___\nInformation from: The Victoria Advocate, http://www.victoriaadvocate.com\nMore from Associated Press: Rescuers search collapsed buildings in Italy after another powerful earthquake hits region near Perugia Texas Longhorns jump all the way up to No. 11 in latest AP poll after beating Notre Dame A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university's president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure Craig Sager is hoping to return to NBA sidelines by November after receiving a rare third bone-marrow transplant David Ortiz honored with a corn maze cut in his likeness More: Associated Press Mosque Fire Texas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T18:58:42.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
