It never occurs to me to say, ‘Are you married?’ It really didn’t.”\nUnfortunately for King, she once fell into a man’s trap, saying, “So I’m out to dinner and he’s talking and then he said something about my wife and I said, ‘Wait, wait, wait, your wife? You have a wife?’ He goes, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Does she know you’re here?’ He said, ‘But, we’re separated.’ I said, ‘Oh, you’re getting a divorce.’ He said, ‘No, we’re separated, we live in the same house, it hasn’t been good for a really long time.’ And I was like, ‘Check please, I know that story.’”\nAs upsetting as that is for anyone, King knows a thing or two about infidelity. In June 2016, she unapologetically called out the woman she caught her ex-husband, former Connecticut Assistant Attorney General William Bumpus, in bed with in 1990.\nIn 2006 she opened up about her 11-year marriage by explaining, “I was married to a cheater . . . I went to marital counseling. I have been divorced since 1993, so I’m all healed and everything. I have worked it out. I’m not bitter. I’m OK. I’m really OK.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:28:33.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
