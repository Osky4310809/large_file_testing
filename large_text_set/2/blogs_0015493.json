Rangers were beaten 2-1 at Dens Park on Sunday \nFormer Rangers manager Alex McLeish has said he would find it hard to turn down a return to Ibrox should he be offered another job there. \nFrank De Boer, the former Rangers defender, has admitted that he would be interested but not until the end of the season. \nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes, another former Rangers player, could come into the Ibrox board's thinking with his current team six points ahead of the Glasgow outfit in second place in the Scottish Premiership. \nFormer Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew, St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright and Billy Davies, the former Rangers player who last managed Nottingham Forest, are behind McLeish in the bookmakers' odds. \nRangers are 30 points behind defending champions Celtic as the Ibrox side's city rivals lead the Premiership. \nThey have only won one of their last four games - a Scottish Cup win over Greenock Morton in Murty's first game in charge - and they are only five points ahead of Hearts as they chase a Europa League place. \nHowever, PA reports that no appointment for either Ibrox position is expected this week, meaning Murty is again likely to be in charge when the Light Blues travel north to take on Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Friday night.
