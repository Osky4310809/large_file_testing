He pleaded guilty last week to three counts of damaging a door and floor over a six-month period from February to August last year.\nWhen police interviewed Camblin, he could offer no explanation other than to describe the act as “spontaneous.”\nInitially, the man who owned the home sought $6,709 in compensation, claiming he paid over $1,250 for a new front door.\nHe also cited the cost of the CCTV camera, services of a professional cleaner, and his inability to rent the property out over the six-month period as further compensation claims.\nThe judge questioned this amount, and in the end ordered the offender to pay $620 in compensation.\nThe offender was suspended from work, and he later resigned. He is now being financially supported by his wife of 17 years.\nHe has been placed on 12 months’ probation and ordered to do 100 hours of community service.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on News.com.au .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:46:00.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
