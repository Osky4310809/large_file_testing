There are screens that can surround the orchestra but theyâ€™re still see-through. When weâ€™re north of the Wall, you can put a digital snow storm onto those screens â€“ you can still see the musicians, but everybody is at the Wall.\"\nSEE ALSO: The 'Game of Thrones' cast is freaking out about the show ending, too\nDjawadi also revealed that in addition to traditional equipment, the orchestra uses 11 rare instruments over the course of the show, and the musicians even \"created some special instruments just for the tour, because certain things I can do in the studio, you canâ€™t do live.\" These include a hammered dulcimer to perform Arya's \"Needle\" theme, a pipe organ, and a 12-foot wildling horn that resembles, according to one audience member, \"a flaccid didgeridoo.\"\nSnow and smoke added atmosphere to the Battle of Castle Black\nImage: laura prudom/mashable\nTo further blur the line between fantasy and reality, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) even lent her voice to the proceedings; Westeros' new queen welcomed her subjects to the concert by issuing a decree that cell phones must be silenced â€” unless attendees wished to be \"boiled alive in the blood of their children.\"\nAnd the fans were eager to immerse themselves â€” some even got into the Westerosi spirit by dressing up as their favorite characters â€” although the Forum insisted that all swords and dragons had to be left at home for the festivities.\nJon Snow and Jaime Lannister bury the hatchet.\nImage: claire gendel\nThere was no shortage of heat on stage, however; the concert combined projected visuals of snow and leaves with practical effects including confetti, water and, yes, plenty of fire â€” utilizing bursts of flame to evoke Daenerys' dragons, and gouts of green smoke that engulfed the stage at the frantic climax of \"Light of the Seven\" â€” a safer alternative to the wildfire that destroyed the Great Sept of Baelor at the end of Season 6.\nThis is as close as I ever want to get to wildfire, thank you very much. ðŸ”¥ pic.twitter.com/wBe5zKeRKo\nâ€” Laura Prudom (@LauInLA) March 24, 2017\nAlmost every major character and house got a chance to shine â€” Theon Greyjoy's betrayal of the Starks featured a special platform on the \"Pyke\" stage that enabled cellist Cameron Stone to splash water as he played, while Melisandre's segment allowed solo vocalist Stevvi Alexander to demonstrate both her range and stage presence in an appropriately blood-red gown as the lights glowed ominously crimson.\nAnother fun #GameOfThronesLive trick I haven't seen before â€” during Theon's section, cellist Cameron Stone made a splash. pic.twitter.com/FLIK6hEum3\nâ€” Laura Prudom (@LauInLA) March 24, 2017\nBut the real thrill was getting to see Game of Thrones ' most memorable moments play out on a grand scale. The series is known for its staggering setpieces, but there's nothing quite as visceral as watching the Battle of the Bastards rage on gigantic screens, the percussion of war drums rattling our bones as Jon Snow's forces brutally clash with Ramsay Bolton's following the murder of Jon's cousin brother Rickon. (Watching the youngest Stark meet his demise was no easier the second time around â€” the crowd couldn't help but heckle him to \"zig-zag\" as he ran straight into the path of Ramsay's arrows.)\n\"The Rains of Castamere\" â€” the chilling Lannister anthem that preceded the infamous Red Wedding â€” was another highlight, as Djawadi brought out special guest vocalist Serj Tankian to perform a new arrangement of the iconic song, drawing ecstatic cheers and shouts of \"The North remembers\" from the audience as Walder Frey's forces murdered Robb Stark and his followers.\nSEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about 'Game of Thrones' Season 7\nDjawadi previously revealed to Mashable that he started off with six hours of material for the concert, and paring it down into a two-hour show proved to be one of his biggest challenges.\n\"We had to take a step back and say 'what are the key scenes? How can we find a nice balance with the characters and the different houses?'\" he admitted. \"But the other thing is that we wanted to take people from Season 1 through 6; start at the beginning and take you through, and by the end of the show youâ€™ll be at the end of Season 6 and itâ€™ll be a nice way of summarizing the [series]. The big idea being that everybody after the show is really pumped for Season 7 and says 'now Iâ€™m ready for something new.'\"\nAs Djawadi, Alexander and the orchestra performed the rousing strains of \"The Winds of Winter\" to close the show, \"pumped\" was a fairly understated description of the mood in the Forum, and the crowd leapt to its feet as the final shots lingered on Daenerys and her dragons setting sail for Westeros, triumphant plumes of fire spurting from the stage.\nSpectacular night at #GameOfThronesLive .
