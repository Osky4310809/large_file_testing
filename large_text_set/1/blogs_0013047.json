He’s proven it during his NBA career. He really likes to shoot.\nZach Lowe of ESPN once detailed just how much Thompson likes to shoot:\nLacob once asked Thompson what he did for fun. Thompson simply responded, \"I like to shoot.\" Lacob explained that he meant what Thompson did off the floor. Thompson shrugged and repeated himself: \"I like to shoot.\"\nKnowing how much he likes to shoot, it should come as no surprise that this happened.\nYo Klay someone was using that ball pic.twitter.com/Gew3xKiU0a \n— CSN Warriors News (@CSNWarriors) January 13, 2017 Stephen Curry was setting up a pregame field goal attempt during warmups. Thompson just happened to drift into the area. He didn’t see Curry, waiting to kick, but he did see a ball. So he shot it. It’s what he does.\nFortunately, there was a ball boy armed and ready nearby. Steph got to kick his attempt. Klay got to shoot.
