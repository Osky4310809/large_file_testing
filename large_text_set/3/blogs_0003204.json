More by Jonathan Tamari Arrow icon \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions will recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations regarding the U.S. presidential election, a day after the Washington Post reported that Sessions spoke to Russia's ambassador twice during the presidential campaign. \nThe announcement of his recusal came Thursday afternoon amid significant pressure from lawmakers and legal experts regarding Sesssions' contacts with Russia while he was campaigning for President Trump. \nLawmakers from Pennsylvania and New Jersey were among those calling for Sessions to resign or recuse himself in light of the contacts and his failure to disclose them during his Senate confirmation hearings. \nShortly after Sessions' announcement, however, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) lauded his former Senate colleague and said he continues to \"strongly support\" the attorney general. \n\"I have always known Jeff Sessions to be honest, ethical, and fair. Today, he has proven once again that this reputation is well deserved,\" the statement read. \nToomey said Sessions acted out of \"an abundance of caution\" but that the attorney general's answers at his confirmation were truthful. In an interview before Sessions' announcement, Toomey had said it was too early to call for his recusal. \nHis comments came in contrast to a growing chorus of legislators who questioned Sessions' actions and called on him to resign or step aside from any investigation. \nMany, including some local Republicans, called for a special prosecutor to investigate Russia's alleged role in the 2016 presidential election after news outlets reported that Sessions twice spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in July and September. At his confirmation hearings, the former Republican senator from Alabama said he had had no contact with the Russians. \nThe Justice Department and FBI – which Sessions oversees – have been leading probes into Russia's potential involvement and any ties to President Trump or his associates. \nRep. Pat Meehan on Thursday was the first Philadelphia-area Republican to call for Sessions to recuse himself from the probe. \n\"The American people must be able to have confidence in the integrity any inquiry into Russian activities and Attorney General Sessions’ involvement would undermine this confidence,\" Meehan, a former federal prosecutor from Delaware County, said in a statement. \"The Attorney General’s testimony during his confirmation has clearly been called into question by news reports indicating he met with the Russian Ambassador prior to the election. Attorney General Sessions should recuse himself and clarify the testimony he gave the Senate prior to his confirmation.\" \nSouth Jersey GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo and Rep. Ryan Costello of Chester County also said Sessions should step away from the probe. Rep. Brian Fitzparick, of Bucks County, said Sessions should recuse himself if either the FBI or Congressional investigations into Russian meddling reaches \"the point that it is necessary.\" \nToomey, in the interview before Sessions' announcement, said \"it's entirely possible this is completely innocuous and very brief conversations,\" between Sessions and the ambassador \"in which case there's no issue.\" He declined to join calls for Sessions to recuse himself. \nToomey's statement later argued that Sessions was truthful in his confirmation hearing because he spoke with the ambassador in role as a senator, not a Trump surrogate -- though one of the meetings was in a clearly political setting, after an event associated with the Republican National Convention . \nOther local Republicans joined calls for Sessions to step aside. \nLoBiondo said in a statement: \"Attorney General Sessions must recuse himself from any investigation into Russian activities and clarify his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, for which I am a member, is conducting a bipartisan investigation of its own that I fully support.\" \nHe added that he will \"strongly push for a declassified report to be released publicly\" when Congress concludes its investigation into Russia's activities. \nMy statement regarding Attorney General Jeff Sessions: https://t.co/XhXRZv8rZN pic.twitter.com/FPNgTIYQaD \n— Rep. Ryan Costello (@RepRyanCostello) March 2, 2017 \nOther Republicans, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , have also pushed for Sessions to recuse himself, joining the scores of Democrats, including those from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, calling for a special prosecutor. \nAG Sessions must recuse himself from the Russia/Trump investigation. We need an independent special prosecutor. \n— Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) March 2, 2017 \nAttorney General Sessions must recuse himself from #TrumpRussia investigation immediately. https://t.co/7efhBWeaRB \n— Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) March 2, 2017 \n3. The President should stop calling Russia story a ruse, and start asking some tough questions of the people he has asked to serve him. \n— Senator Bob Menendez (@SenatorMenendez) March 2, 2017 \nAlso among the Republicans calling for Sessions to recuse himself was a North Jersey legislator, Rep. Leonard Lance. \nLance FB post. \nSen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey who, in an unusual move , testified against his former colleague at Sessions' confirmation hearing, was among those pushing for an independent investigator. He pointed out that there were legitimate reasons for a senator to speak with a foreign ambassador, but said his failure to disclose the contacts raise suspicion that \"he is compromised.\" \nThere are many legitimate reasons. Sessions should have disclosed it but didn't. Why? He is compromised. Independent investigation now. https://t.co/UfT7YHERMf \n— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) March 2, 2017 \nHe called for Sessions to resign. \n\"Mr. Sessions has irrevocably eroded confidence in his ability to continue serving as an impartial enforcer of America’s laws. For the good of the country, Jeff Sessions should resign as Attorney General,\" Booker said in a statement. \nDemocratic Reps. Dwight Evans, of Philadelphia, and Donald Norcross, of South Jersey, also called for Sessions to quit. \n\"If in fact Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied to the American people about his involvement with the Russian Government during his confirmation hearings, the Administration must make a powerful statement, do what is right, and demand his resignation,” Rep. Dwight Evans (D., Pa.) said in a statement. \nClear #Sessions lied about his interactions w/Russia.No way to continue in his position w/ confidence of American people. He must resign \n— Rep. Frank Pallone (@FrankPallone) March 2, 2017 \nI stand firmly with Ranking Member @RepCummings call for AG Sessions' resignation. https://t.co/1Z2YAjZd4Z \n— Bonnie WatsonColeman (@RepBonnie) March 2, 2017 \n#Sessions should resign immediately. We need an independent, outside, & bipartisan investigation to determine Trump's Russia ties \n— Donald Payne Jr. (@RepDonaldPayne) March 2, 2017 \n\"The attorney general – the highest law enforcement official in the country, in charge of federal investigators and prosecutors – must be beyond reproach. At the very least, Attorney General Jeff Sessions lied under oath. At the very worst, Sessions could be involved in covering up Russian interference with our election,\" Norcross said in his statement calling for Sessions' resignation.
