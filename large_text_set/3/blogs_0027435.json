Users can swiftly email calendar events to themselves or to a friend, get more information about groups hosting events, and add an event to their smart phone calendar. \nThe app is in its early stages, but I downloaded it yesterday and found it easy to navigate. The more people who use it, and the more group leaders who keep their calendars updated, the more useful it’ll be. \nWhile the calendars are currently taken from websites like Meetup and affiliates of national organizations, I’m told that the landing page will soon include an email address so local group leaders can add their calendars to the list as well. \nFor now, you can get it by searching for UnitedCoR in the App store or using the links on this page .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:43:17.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
