In a Facetime video between the two, the 19-year-old rapper asked the “Cash me outside” girl about her boyfriend and used some graphic language with the 13-year-old. \n“You ’bout to put that p***y on him?” Kodak Black asked as Bregoli laughed. \nThe conversation came after Danielle Bregoli’s controversial appearance in Kodak Black’s “Everything 1k” video, where she danced on a luxury car.

A few weeks after she first shot to fame, the “Cash me outside” girl streamed an Instagram Live video on her bhadbhabie page that showed her twerking on a bed while wearing just a bra and tight pants. Danielle Bregoli started another fight, and this time it's with Kylie #KylieKardashian #CashMeOutside https://t.co/IoR7ViC8AH pic.twitter.com/Hcgshnx1gl \n— Hollyscoop (@Hollyscoop) February 21, 2017 \nThe “Cash me outside” girl’s Instagram Live twerking video had close to 70,000 viewers at its peak and was later uploaded to YouTube, where it got tens of thousands of views in just a few hours and generated plenty of controversy among viewers who believed it was too racy for a 13-year-old to be posting such a video. \nThe video was posted just days after Bregoli got in some real-life trouble during a flight at LAX. The “Cash me outside” girl got into a fight with another passenger there and ended up getting kicked off the plane, TMZ noted. \n“We’ve learned Danielle Bregoli and her mom were boarding a Spirit Airlines flight out of LAX last night… when Mom got into a dispute with a female passenger. We’re told Danielle’s mother was struggling to put her carry-on bag in the overhead, because she’s wearing a walking cast for an injured foot… and the wait wasn’t sitting well with the third party. \n“Danielle says the other woman put her hands on her mom’s throat, and that’s why she had to “cold-cock” the impatient passenger.” \nAnd Kodak Black is no stranger to controversy himself. The rapper is fresh out of a several week stint in jail after being picked up on charges that he sexually assaulted a woman after a concert last summer. Kodak Black was released in December after posting $100,000 bond and is still awaiting trial, the Sun-Sentinel reported. \nKodak Black stirred up more trouble late last month when he live-streamed a video of himself and another man having sex with a woman. As Vibe noted, the video was quite explicit. \n“The rapper aired the hotel room shenanigans on Thursday evening (Jan. 26) to the dismay of his fans,” the Vibe report noted. “Before showing the young woman (who didn’t look like she wanted to be filmed), the rapper shared with fans how he requires papers from groupies who want to lay in the sheets with him. Things only got worse for the rapper when portions of the video were ripped from the stream and placed on Twitter.” \nDanielle Bregoli’s x-rated Facetime talk with Kodak Black has also kicked up controversy, with many commenters noting on the inappropriate nature of the video. \n[Featured Image by Danielle Bregoli/ Instagram ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:52:14.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
