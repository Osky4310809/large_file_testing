We both grew up on a lot of the same bands but just as songwriters and as players, I really had to kind of relearn the guitar.\"There were things he did that were really cool and just genius ideas I would never think to play or I've never played.\" \nGetting more specific, Matt added: \"I've never been a big pull-off or hammer-on guy and to learn how to do that kind of stuff has definitely made me a better player. A lot of the set was stuff I had never played before apart from the songs themselves. Stylistically and in theory, I had never played anything like that. There was a huge learning curve.\" \nAsked whether there was \"a fine line you had to tread between playing the Blink songs faithfully and then trying to make them your own,\" the guitarist replied: \n\"Absolutely. I learned how to play everything exactly the way that it was played on the record. Once I got comfortable in doing that, there were ideas I had for things to do live. \n\"But then of course also adding my own flavor to the lyrics and to the playing was something I wanted to do just out of love for the songs and in the interest of making them my own. \n\"You want the songs to be familiar and you don't want it to be a huge departure from what they were but at the same time I am my own person. The guys [felt] it was a big part of why they asked me to do it. They dug the way I did things with Alkaline Trio so I did bring a lot of my own flavor to the songs.\" \nNext question: \"Did you have to rethink your approach guitar and amp-wise in terms of sounds and textures that were different than what you did with Alkaline Trio?\" \nResponse: \"We started out using my setup, which was a Bogner Shiva. I used a combination of three different amps including a Fender Supersonic and some Line 6 pedals. I brought in all my gear from Alkaline Trio and I ended up switching over to a Kemper. Mark was playing through a Kemper and I was a little skeptical at first because I didn't understand the way the system worked. Now my bandmates in Alkaline Trio are even switching to Kemper. \n\"Those things [Kempers] are amazing. The tones I used in Alkaline Trio and the tones I use in Blink are quite a bit different. So yes, there was definitely some reengineering of tone and pretty much reengineering everything to fit with what Blink is known for and loved for.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T07:21:31.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
