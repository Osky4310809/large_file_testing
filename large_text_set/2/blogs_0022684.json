Gavin McDonnell suffered his first defeat as a professional in 19 fights by a majority decision to Rey Vargas Gavin McDonnell's dream of joining twin brother Jamie as a world champion was shattered as classy Mexican Rey Vargas scored a points decision to land the vacant WBC super-bantamweight title. \nThe 30-year-old produced a display of immense grit, landing telling blows in the ninth round, but his 26-year-old opponent's confident work throughout saw him gain a 114-114 117-111 116-112 decision. \nVictory would have delivered Britain's first simultaneous twin world champions, with Jamie McDonnell already in possession of the WBA bantamweight belt. \nBut Vargas - unbeaten in 29 bouts - was rewarded for his control of the early exchanges and left the noisy Ice Arena in Hull with his first world title. \nVargas, with Iganacio Beristain - who has trained Oscar De La Hoya and Juan Manuel Marquez to world titles - in his corner, took the middle of the ring early and confidently landed three-shot combinations with McDonnell visibly cautious against a man with 22 previous knockouts. \nIn the build-up to the fight, McDonnell's promoter Eddie Hearn said he pushed for the bout to take place at the \"down and dirty\" Hull Ice Arena in hope the \"bear-pit\" atmosphere could do \"strange things\" to the travelling fighter. \nThere were moments of home hope, as McDonnell landed a stinging right in the 10th but in just his third fight outside of Mexico, Vargas even had the temerity to smile back at his man after taking some punishment late on. \nThe victor's confidence to switch from making the fight to boxing on the back foot near the ropes perhaps showed he knew he had built a good early lead. McDonnell's head movement was energetic throughout, while his conqueror contently stayed static on times as he waited to pick his attacks. \nNow 19 fights into his career, McDonnell can take great pride from the heart he showed throughout and none of the 3,500 in the venue appeared to feel short changed by his efforts. \nIn truth, he simply came up against a fighter who carried power, showed variation, and a cool head to handle the occasion. \nUpon the final bell, Vargas threw his hands into the air before slumping to the ropes and looking to the heavens. McDonnell in contrast seemed to know hopes of family history were over, for now. \nEarlier in the night, London 2012 Olympic champion Luke Campbell maintained his momentum as he seeks a world title shot in 2017, \"the biggest year of my career\", according to the Hull fighter. \nThe 29-year-old lightweight recorded his fourth straight win following a shock defeat in 2015 to Yvan Mendy with a series of crushing left hands to Jairo Lopez. \nThe Mexican, down in the first, somehow made the second round but was flattened by a left uppercut. Campbell, who began training in Miami after the Mendy defeat, showed his typically energetic style and now holds hope of a shot at WBC champion Mikey Garcia. \nElsewhere, Hull fighter Tommy Coyle - beaten by Campbell in 2015 - kept his hopes of a return to world level alive, with a third round stoppage of Rakeem Noble. \nThe undercard proved fluid, none more so than heavyweight Dave Allen's 31-second win, but ultimately, McDonnell's main event was worth waiting for, even if the result could not satisfy local hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:30:13.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
