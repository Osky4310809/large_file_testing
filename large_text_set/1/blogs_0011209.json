The bad English and suspicious “Perodua Malaysia Company” FB page name should already be screaming “HOAX!” at those “fortunate” enough to see it in their news feed (I haven’t seen this particular one). \nBut for those who are wondering – or worse, responded to the post – the real Perodua has now released a statement denying that it is involved in giving out free cars. Below is the statement by Perodua MD Datuk Dr. Zahari Husin in full. \nPerodua wishes to state that Perodua does not have any campaign to give away 15 new Perodua Myvi which was posted on a Facebook account name “Perodua Malaysia Company”. We are in no way associated with this Facebook account. \nDespite the post being taken down by the account owner, we wish to advise the public to only refer to our official channels on ongoing campaigns and promotions. \nThese official channels include our Facebook account under the “MYPerodua” name; our official website (www.perodua.com.my); our Instagram account (MYPerodua_instagram) and our dedicated customer loyalty website (www.ufirst.com.my). \nCurrently, we have one sales campaign which is the “Golden Prosperity Deals” whereby Perodua offers savings of up to RM3,888 on selected models. \nIn addition to the “Golden Prosperity Deals”, Perodua is also welcoming all members of the public to visit our “MYPerodua Nation” , which is Perodua’s largest carnival at the Aeon Mall Shah Alam (Outdoor Carpark) between 20th and 22nd January 2017. \nThank you. \nRemember folks – whether it’s beautiful girls chatting you up or free cars – when something is too good to be true, then it probably is!
