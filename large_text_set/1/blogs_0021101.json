The limited edition version of the Huawei Mate 9 is now available to pre-order from the Porsche Design site, and it will set you back a whopping €1395.\nSee also: Problems with the Huawei Mate 9 and how to fix them 4 weeks ago This version of the phone has many of the same hardware specs as the Huawei Mate 9. Both have the Kirin 960 Octa-core processor, Android 7.0 Nougat with the custom EMUI 5.0 user interface, dual rear 20MP and 12MP cameras, an 8MP front-facing camera, and a 4000 mAh battery. The Porsche Design Mate 9 offers a curved 5.5-inch QHD version of the regular Mate 9’s 5.9-inch display. The Porsche Design variant also has 6GB of RAM compared to 4GB for the Mate 9, and a whopping 256GB of onboard storage versus 64GB for the standard Mate 9.\nAside from those big hardware changes, the other other minor differences in the Porsche Design Mate 9 are in its software. Its on-screen keys are replaced by “back” and “recent apps” keys on each side of the home button in the Porsche Design version. There are also some UI changes for this phone’s high-res display, a handy dark display mode and finally some Porsche Design themes for people who really want to make sure people know they have lots of money.\nShipments of the Porsche Design Mate 9 are scheduled to begin on Tuesday, Jan. 31. There’s no word on exactly how many units of this phone will be available before they are all sold out, but since this is supposed to be a limited edition variant, it’s likely to sell out very quickly, even at this high of a price point. Will you get a second mortgage on your house to get this phone?
