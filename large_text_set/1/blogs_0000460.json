He noted that Peabody bred pine trees as a hobby. \nWhen Marty traveled to 1955 , he accidentally ran over one of a pair of pine trees in Mr. Peabody's front yard. When Marty returned to 1985, there was only one pine tree at the front of the mall and as a result the mall's name was changed to Lone Pine Mall . \nThis was also an important location because it was where Doc was shot by Libyan terrorists until Marty wrote the letter forewarning of it in 1955 . Although Doc tore up the letter on discovering it, he later stuck it back together with scotch tape, read it, and subsequently wore a bulletproof vest on the night of October 26. \nA Fox Photo stand was located in the mall's parking lot — that is, until it unfortunately got in the way of the the Libyans' Volkswagen Station Wagon . \nIn the altered 1985 , the mall was owned by BiffCo . Note: The following section is considered non-canon or is disputed in canonicity . \nIn the 1986A timeline, the mall was again owned by the Tannens and named Tannenville Mall. According to the sign, the following services were present: 6 casinos 15 bars 8 gentlemen's clubs [1] \nSometime in 1992, Walter Wisdom made a public appearance at Lone Pine Mall, which Marty and Verne Brown attended. Non-canon or disputable information ends here. Behind the scenes Edit The filming location for the mall was the south-east side of the Puente Hills Mall in Industry, California, in eastern Los Angeles County; the mall has had major renovation in recent years and consequently, is unrecognizable from how it looked in the movie, however the parking lot remained largely intact. There is still black tape of some sort left on the parking lot, seeming to mark the fire trails and where Doc and Marty stood upon the first experiment.
