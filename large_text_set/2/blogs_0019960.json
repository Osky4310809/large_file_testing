It’s not.” \nAmerica supports ethanol via billions in subsidies and federal programs like the RFS, which requires gasoline sold in the U.S. to contain a certain amount of ethanol. These ethanol subsidies and mandates cost motorists $10 billion annually in additional fuel costs, according to a study published in March 2015 by the Manhattan Institute . \n“The unemployment rate did not drop as much or as fast in corn belt counties,” Simmons noted. “Per capita income fell more in Corn Belt counties than in others…We shouldn’t be subsidizing any form of energy, but especially not corn.” \nFederal ethanol mandates are extremely expensive and won’t meet their goals, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report . GAO estimates that between 2013 and 2015, the federal government invested more than $1.1 billion into research and development of advanced biofuels despite these inherent problems. \nRoughly 45 percent of American corn is now used to produce biofuels like ethanol. \nSimmons speculated that politicians think they’re helping corn-growing areas when they promote ethanol and that they have a powerful incentive to support biofuels because of the Iowa Caucus’ role in presidential primaries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T16:52:06.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
