As part of the restructuring, Shutterfly will reduce its workforce by 13 percent, affecting 260 employees. Shutterfly said it would close its Santa Clara, California and New York locations. \nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the Redwood City, California-based company posted earnings of $2.63 per share on revenue of $561 million. Wall Street had expected Shutterfly to report earnings per share of $2.84 on $584 million in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. \nFor the fiscal first quarter, Shutterfly said it expects a loss per share between 95 cents and $1. That loss per share range is larger than the 84 cents that analysts had projected, according to Thomson Reuters.
