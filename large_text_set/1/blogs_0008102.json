The upstart brewer has already concocted a stout using Bow Truss Coffee named in honor of dearly-departed Wham! frontman George Michael (It’s called “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go”). The beer—and a nitro version—occupied two of the tasting room’s 12 taps. There’s two TVs inside the tasting room, so visitors can watch sports. Instead of growler fills to go, On Tour offers smaller crowlers, encouraging drinkers to mix and match from their variety of brews. Click here for On Tour’s tap list. The brewer hopes to go the food truck route, as there’s no food available on site. The tasting room occupies 1,500 square feet, part of the 4,500-square-foot brewery. The building, since 1940, has housed the Hudson Boiler and Tank Co. before the firm moved to the suburbs. Music and adventure inspired brewery owner Mark Legenza. He hopes drinkers will leave their cares behind when they visit. They’ll back open on Wednesday. Check out the photos below. On Tour Brewing Co. , 1725 W Hubbard St., (312) 796-3119, open 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday; 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday; 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday.
