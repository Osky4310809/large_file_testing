However, it offers very little information about who’s trying to log in. Now, Google will add location and time info to the login attempt. Advertisement \nIn addition to a full-screen window prompting you to approve a login request, the new system will show you a location and IP address for the computer that’s trying to log in, the device they’re using, and the time when they tried to log in. This helps make sure that you’re approving the correct request. If the info matches your own device, then approve it. Otherwise, ignore it.
