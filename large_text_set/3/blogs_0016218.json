(Come on, April.)\nIf you're like us and fully fed-up with this never-ending feed, we come bearing exciting news. According to Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York, April's calf is now \"moving up and sticking out.\"\nAs disgusting as that sounds, it's actually pretty exciting because it means this nightmare is finally almost ov ... oh, what was that? That doesn't mean April is in labor yet? Oh, okay.\nSEE ALSO: This giraffe birth livestream is driving the internet insane\nAccording to the zoo's Sunday Facebook report, while the giraffe-child is now \"sticking out\" of April, she is still not yet in labor.\n\"All are happy with progress, we are not in labor at this time,\" the post said.\n\"Observation overnight peaked our interest a few times, but nothing to report just yet,\" the zoo later updated in its report Monday morning. \"No pressure April the Giraffe, but April the month isn't far away!\"\nIf you've been (begrudgingly) keeping an eye on the stream, you've probably noticed April has grown a little restless in her pen. The zoo was happy to report that the giraffe-mother-to-be and her mate Oliver will be moving outside as the weather warms up and the snow melts.\nBesides her restlessness, the zoo reports April is in “great physical and mental condition,” and the vets who have been monitoring her say they’re happy with her progress. Giraffe pregnancies last up to 15 months (please, God no), and labor lasts anywhere from a few hours to a few days.\nApril's calf will be the first born at Animal Adventure Park, and should be about 150 pounds and 6 feet tall once it's finally born. One day. One joyous day.\nOne. sweet. day.\nKeep an eye on April's livestream below.\nWATCH: A designer creates a sustainable fashion line that grows with your kids", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGEEGDIHDRc?enablejsapi=1&", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/KAp3FRxg.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/AnimalAdventurePark/photos/a.248725055230381.37912.246833958752824/934066950029518/?type=3&theater", "https://www.facebook.com/AnimalAdventurePark/?fref=ts", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/KAp3FRxg.m3u8", "https://www.facebook.com/AnimalAdventurePark/photos/a.248725055230381.37912.246833958752824/934367319999481/?type=3&theater"], "published": "2017-03-21T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:57:49.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
