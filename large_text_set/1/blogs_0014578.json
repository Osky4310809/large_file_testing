The 32-year-old kicker hit not one but two kicks from 50-plus yards in the fourth quarter to lift the Packers to a thrilling 34-31 win over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. \nCrosby’s first kick was from 56 yards, giving the Cowboys a 31-28 lead with 1:33 left. But after Cowboys kicker Dan Bailey tied the score at 31 with a 52-yarder, Crosby converted once again – this time from 51 yards as time expired. \n— NFL (@NFL) January 16, 2017 \nYou’d assume Crosby has nailed a number of clutch kicks throughout his 10-year career with the Packers, but what he did Sunday he had never accomplished in the NFL. According to ESPN Stats and Info, Crosby entered Sunday’s game 0-for-4 on potential game-tying or go-ahead field goals from 50-plus yards in the fourth quarter or overtime. Mason Crosby is 0-of-4 in his career on potential game-tying or go-ahead FG from 50+ yards in the 4th/OT entering this kick \n— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 16, 2017 \nCrosby ended that drought in a big way Sunday, helping the Packers hand the Cowboys only their second loss at home this season. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:08:25.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
