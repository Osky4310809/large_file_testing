His film Raees then clashed with Hrithik's Kaabil . While Raees was very successful, Dilwale failed to make much of a mark at the box office. Meanwhile Akshay Kumar clashed with Hrithik Roshan ( Mojenjo Daro) with his film Rustom on Independence Day 2016. \nAnd now, Kumar's next film Toilet Ek Prem Katha, which also stars Bhumi Pednekar, is all set to release on 11 August 2017. The sad news is that there's another clash in the offing. Imitiaz Ali's next film, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma, tentatively titled Rahnuma , will also release on the same date. It's SRK versus Akshay Kumar on 11 Aug 2017 now... Imtiaz Ali's SRK-Anushka starrer [not titled yet] versus #ToiletEkPremKatha . \n— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) March 28, 2017 \nShah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar have never clashed at the box office before so it will be difficult to determine who is more likely to be successful. Both have massive fan following both in India and outside. Both actors see a massive opening for their films as well. While Toilet Ek Prem Katha is a comedy film based on PM Modi's 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' dealing with the unhygienic standards in rural India, Imtiaz Ali's next is a love story revolving around a tour guide. \nA very good morning from @psbhumi and me from the sets of Toilet - Ek Prem Katha!
