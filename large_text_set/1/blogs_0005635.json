Culture Club / Contributor / Getty Images By Jack Zavada Updated September 05, 2016 . \nJohn the Apostle had the distinction of being a beloved friend of Jesus Christ , writer of five books of the New Testament, and a pillar in the early Christian church. \nJohn and his brother James , another disciple of Jesus, were fishermen on the Sea of Galilee when Jesus called them to follow him. They later became part of Christ's inner circle, along with the Apostle Peter . These three were privileged to be with Jesus at the raising of Jairus' daughter from the dead, at the transfiguration , and during Jesus' agony in Gethsemane . \nOn one occasion, when a Samaritan village rejected Jesus, James and John asked if they should call down fire from heaven to destroy the place. That earned them the nickname Boanerges , or \"sons of thunder.\" \nA previous relationship with Joseph Caiaphas allowed John to be present in the high priest's house during Jesus' trial. On the cross , Jesus entrusted the care of his mother, Mary , to an unnamed disciple, probably John, who took her into his home (John 19:27). Some scholars speculate that John may have been a cousin of Jesus. \nJohn served the church in Jerusalem for many years, then moved to work in the church at Ephesus . An unsubstantiated legend holds that John was taken to Rome during a persecution and thrown into boiling oil but emerged unhurt. He was then exiled to the island of Patmos. John supposedly outlived all of the disciples , dying of old age at Ephesus, perhaps about A.D. 98. \nJohn's Gospel is strikingly different from Matthew , Mark , and Luke , the three Synoptic Gospels , which means \"seen with the same eye\" or from the same viewpoint. John continually emphasizes that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God , sent by the Father to take away the sins of the world. He uses many symbolic titles for Jesus, such as the Lamb of God , resurrection, and the vine. Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus uses the phrase \"I am,\" unmistakably identifying himself with Jehovah , the Great \"I AM\" or eternal God. \nAlthough John does not mention himself by name in his own gospel, he refers to himself four times as \"the disciple Jesus loved.\" Accomplishments of John the Apostle \nJohn was one of the first disciples chosen. He was an elder in the early church and helped spread the gospel message. He is credited with writing the Gospel of John; the letters 1 John , 2 John, and 3 John; and the book of Revelation . John's Strengths \nJohn was especially loyal to Jesus. He was the only one of the 12 apostles present at the cross. After Pentecost , John teamed up with Peter to fearlessly preach the gospel in Jerusalem and suffered beatings and imprisonment for it. Because John experienced the unconditional love of Jesus firsthand, he preached that love in his gospel and letters. John's Weaknesses \nAt times, John did not understand Jesus' message of forgiveness , as when he asked to call fire down upon unbelievers. He also asked for a favored position in Jesus' kingdom. Life Lessons from John the Apostle \nChrist is the Savior who offers every person eternal life . If we follow Jesus, we are assured of forgiveness and salvation . As Christ loves us, we are to love others. God is love , and we, as Christians, are to be channels of God's love to our neighbors. Hometown References to John the Apostle in the Bible \nJohn is mentioned in the four Gospels, the book of Acts , and as the narrator of Revelation. Occupation \nFisherman, disciple of Jesus, evangelist, Scripture author.
