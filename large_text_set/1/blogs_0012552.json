That turned into a postgame outburst directed at a reporter.\nAccording to the Seattle Times , Bennett became upset when he was asked about not getting a pass rush on Matt Ryan . Bennett said, “Matt Ryan is obviously the MVP of the NFL this year and made great plays.” After questioning the amount of pressure the Seahawks got on Ryan, Bennett maintained that they did well in pressuring him.\nThen, he started to get much more aggressive with his language.\n“I just put my heart on the [expletive] field. Don’t [expletive] play with me. Get the [expletive] out of my face then. Try me again, see what happens. I ain’t one of these [expletive] out here. Don’t try to tell me what I didn’t do [expletive].”\nAccording to the Washington Post , Bennett continued, “We lost the game! That’s the NFL, you non-playing [expletive]! What you do with your life? What you do with your lifetime, [expletive]? What injury you play through? What adversity you went through?”\nSeattle Times reporter Matt Calkins actually had an idea of some adversity that particular reporter went through:\nDuring tirade, Michael Bennett asked Q13 reporter Bill Wixey \"What adversity you went through?!\" Well, Wixey survived Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\n— Matt Calkins (@Matt_Calkins) January 15, 2017 In the video below, you can hear some of Bennett’s rant towards the end of the video.\n. @thenewstribune video: Richard Sherman in #Seahawks ' locker room after loss at ATL.

He was seen pointing at Falcons players from the sideline, before ultimately coming back in when he continued to get frustrated with the Falcons offensive line .\nHe finished the game with one sack, and three tackles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T07:21:14.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
