Tired of your commute? The National T rust is looking for someone to look after wildlife on the Farne Islands. \nWorking on a remote island could be someone's dream job; surrounded by seal pups and beautiful birds, the successful applicant will have a one-minute commute. \nThe Farne Islands Ranger will have some very important jobs to do; including counting the 200 seal pups born on the islands each year, surveying the 37,000 pairs of puffins and sometimes even saving the lives of soaked Arctic tern chicks using a hairdryer. A photo posted by Tim Oakes (@timoakes) on Jan 23, 2017 at 10:41am PST \nT he job doesn't come without its risks; rangers on the islands must brave dive-bombing attacks from Arctic terns, no running water and harsh spring storms that can see them marooned on the islands for weeks at a time. \nHowever, quality of life on the islands, which have been looked after by the National Trust since 1925, seems high. \nThe islands, which have been protected for 189 years and are one of Britain’s oldest nature reserves, boast gorgeous sunrises and one of England's largest seal colonies. It's a nature-lover's paradise.

Being good with PowerPoint isn’t a priority. \n“We’re looking for someone with a passion for wildlife and conservation – and who wants to share that passion with others. A photo posted by Roberto Zaffi (@robyzaffi_photo) on Jan 18, 2017 at 10:23pm PST \n“Rangers have been based on the Farne Islands for almost 190 years, with scientists carrying out research here for decades. Last year a Springwatch-backed study found that a Farne Islands Arctic tern had made a record-breaking migration, flying 96,000km to Antarctica and back.

It’s a wildlife-lover’s paradise: open the curtains in the morning and you’re greeted with crowds of fluffy seal pups or scampering Arctic tern chicks. \n“As a ranger you’ll be in charge of monitoring the wildlife and seals on the islands – as well as assisting with scientific research. A photo posted by Hannah Milankovic (@bunny_shark) on Jan 6, 2017 at 2:55am PST \n“Every season is different and you’ll be doing everything from carrying out repairs and counting cute seal pups in October to blow-drying sickly Arctic terns or handling puffin chicks during our five-yearly count of the colourful birds. \n“But it’s not a job for the faint-hearted. All our water on the island has to be brought in by boat – and we’ve not got a washing machine. Rangers can end up marooned in their cottage during the seal mating season and the island’s thousands of Arctic terns are known for diving at people’s heads in a bid to defend their chicks.” \nT he islands attract 50,000 visitors a year and are managed by a close-knit team; could you be on it? \nApplications for the job, which pays £17,934 per annum including accommodation on the islands, close on the 7th February.
