That is as far as current telescopes have been able to probe. \nHowever, astronomers think that nearly every star in the universe could have at least one planet - that's trillions of planets, waiting to be found.

If the planet is too far from the star, any water on the surface freezes. \nThe habitable zone (or \"Goldilocks zone\") is the range of orbital distances from a star at which liquid water can exist on the surface of a planet. \nThis range of distances changes depending on the size and temperature of the star. \nEarth is in the habitable zone of the sun - one of the reasons our planet has liquid water like oceans and lakes. Earth is in the habitable zone of the sun (Photo: Getty) \nThis is important because life on Earth started in water, and water is a necessary ingredient for life as we know it. \nRocky exoplanets found in the habitable zone of their star are more likely to have liquid water on their surface. What is special about the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets? \nThe TRAPPIST-1 planetary system sets a new record for the greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. \nAll of these seven planets could have liquid water, which is key to life as we know it.
