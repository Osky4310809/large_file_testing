I am one of the people you are supposedly marching for. I was raped by Bill Clinton. Did you hear me? I am one of many that Bill Clinton assaulted. Where were you ladies when I was hurting and scared? This past year, I once again told about my horrific encounter with Bill Clinton. \nWhere were you? You were silent because of your support for Hillary Clinton. Shame on you; all of you. I can finally move forward because your candidate, Hillary Clinton, and Bill Clinton, my abuser, no longer matter. \nJones took particular offense at the involvement of Hollywood celebrities who are slated to participate in the march. \n“Hollywood is insane and they are idiots. Most of America doesn’t care about what they have to say, as we all witnessed during the last election. These celebrities should only be there for our entertainment when we want to go see them. Otherwise they should shut up,” Jones told this reporter. \nAddressing the march organizers, Jones stated, \nWhat did they do for us when we were sexually assaulted by the man that they actually support? I mean their brains are so twisted and so fried. Where were they when we were out there telling our stories again about the Clintons, and how Hillary enabled him to do what he did, and then she covered it up and smeared us. What about us? We are women and nobody came to our defense, especially from Hollywood. \nPretty embarrassing that liberals feel the need to hold an event like this. \nBut hey, if they want to keep losing elections they can knock themselves out.
