In Russia, there have been protests against the film's gay content, with a compromise reached - the film will be screened, but children under 16 will not be allowed in. \nIf you'd rather skip the cinema and chill with Netflix, here's our recommendations for your TV binge-fest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T05:30:45.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
