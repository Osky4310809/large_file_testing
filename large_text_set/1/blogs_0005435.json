The actor’s film, Sultan was one of the top contenders in many categories. Bollywood’s much-loved superstar, Salman is besieged by media wherever he goes but it was different this time around. At Stardust, the actor chose to make a silent entry. The film created a lot of buzz considering the number of trophies it bagged. For all those unaware, Sultan won Best Costume which was given by Alvira Agnihotri Khan and Ashley Rebello. Rebello even clicked a picture with the star and shared it on Instagram. (ALSO READ – Iulia Vantur to perform live at Stardust Awards, courtesy Salman Khan!) \nNot to forget, his rumoured ladylove also performed at the awards show for the first time. Yes. Iulia Vantur was very much present at Stardust and she did perform on Main Hoon Hero Tera, the song which was sung by Salman Khan! We’ve heard her sing this track in the past as well. So was it that the actor made a silent entry and kept away from the eyes of the media because of this? Clearly, Sultan did win big but at the same time his ‘good friend’ Iulia also performed for the first time. Perhaps the actor wanted to show support to Miss Vantur as well while he cheered for his film. These are the two reasons we can think of. And as we speak of Mr Khan, we gotta admit that he looked really cute. Wearing a black shirt and lightly checkered pants, the 50 year old looked very adorable.

The film won a total of three awards at the function. The good thing is, Sultan took away awards from two major categories i.e. Best Actress and Best Film! This sure is a news to rejoice for the Sultan team. The film did do well at the box office in terms of money as well as performance of Khan and Sharma. If you’ve missed the complete list of winners, you can check it out here. At the event, when inquired to Ranbir Kapoor on the Best Actor category, the 34 year old modestly stated how Salman Khan and Amitabh Bachchan deserve it more than him. However, Khan lost the award to the other Khan, Shah Rukh! \nWhat are your thoughts, BollywoodLifers? Tell us in the comments section below.
