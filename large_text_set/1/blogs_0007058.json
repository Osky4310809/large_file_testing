Astronaut Jeanette Epps has become the first Black American astronaut to board the International Space Station — how awesome is that?\nJeanette’s accomplishment is nothing to sneeze at, but Black women have been making strides in space for a while.\nOther African American astronauts have been into space officially, (like Mae Jemison, the first Black woman astronaut ever with the space shuttle Endeavor ) though Jeanette will be the first with ISS . She’ll also be the 13th woman to be aboard the ISS as a crew member since the space station’s founding.\nCulmination of a great week of training in Star City. pic.twitter.com/gUU1y319fM \n— Jeanette J. Epps (@Astro_Jeanette) December 10, 2016 This is especially interesting timing, as the country is getting swept up by the magic of Hidden Figures , a film that highlights the role that Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson — three Black women working with NASA — played in launching John Glenn into space.\n2016 may not have been the best year, but it looks like 2017 is off to a much better start. Black women in space are having a moment, and it’s time that the country take notice.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:57:43.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
