Speaking to the Los Angeles Times , director Niki Caro said nothing has been formalized for her film — including its soundtrack. \n“I don’t know where that’s come from,” Caro said when asked about word that the new take on Mulan will lack songs. “We’ve never talked about songs, and no decision has been made.”\nBut in an interview with EW on Tuesday morning, Disney president of production Sean Bailey said Mulan is “not currently intended to be .” Bailey added, however, that “nothing is off the table.”\nThe confusion about whether or not this new version of Mulan will be a musical started when Caro said in an interview that she didn’t expect the feature to include songs from the 1998 animated film. “Yes, from what I understand, no songs right now, much to the horror of my children,” Caro told Moviefone when told of the rumors that Mulan will be song-less.\nThe Disney classic included such popular songs as “I’ll Make a Man Out of You,” “A Girl Worth Fighting For,” and “Reflection.”\nDespite the lack of information on the new Mulan , Caro did previously tease that her vision for the film is “a big, girly martial arts epic.”\n“It will be extremely muscular and thrilling and entertaining and moving,” she told Moviefone.\nCaro has said she hasn’t started on the project just yet, which is due to arrive in theaters on Nov. 2, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:02:02.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
