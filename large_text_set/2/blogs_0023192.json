It reenacts the wedding of Lord Sundareswarar (Lord Shiva) and Goddess Meenakshi (Lord Vishnu's sister). \nTraditionally, Lord Vishnu has high caste followers, while Lord Shiva is worshiped by those of lower castes. What's interesting to note is that Meenakshi's marriage to Lord Shiva unites people of all castes, hence bridging the caste gap. When is the Festival? \nIt begins on the fifth day of the bright half of the Tamil month Chitrai (April/May in the English calendar). In 2017, the dates of the Chithirai Festival are from April 28 to May 13. Where is it Held? \nAt the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, Tamil Nadu . The parades takes place in the streets around the temple (known as the Masi streets). How is it Celebrated? \nThe festival begins with a flag hoisting ceremony. However, the most important celebrations occur towards the end of the festival. After the celestial wedding, the location shifts to Kallazhagar Temple (also known as Azhagar/Alagar Kovil) in the Azhagar/Alagar Hills near Madurai, where Lord Vishnu presides as Meenakshi's older brother Azhagar (also known as Lord Kallazhagar). \ncontinue reading below our video Beware! The 5 Most Common Travel Scams \nLegend has it that Lord Kallazhagar traveled on a golden horse to participate in the celestial wedding of his sister Meenakshi. Unfortunately, he gets delayed and misses the wedding. Meenakshi and Lord Shiva come to the Vaigai River, where he reached, to try and pacify him. However, in his fury he gets into the river to give them his gifts, then goes back home without visiting Madurai. One of the biggest spectacles of the Chithirai Festival is this procession, particularly the moment that Lord Kallazhagar enters the river. \nIn 2017, the most important dates are: May 5: Coronation of the Goddess Meenakshi (Pattabhishekam). May 6: Procession of Goddess Meenakshi. May 7: Celestial wedding of God and Goddess. The deities are paraded in their wedding attire around the temple streets, before being brought into the grandly decorated hall inside the temple.
