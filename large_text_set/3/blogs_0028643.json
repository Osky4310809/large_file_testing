Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism told the Huffington Post : “As one gets older metabolism changes; also neuroplasticity ― the ability of neuronal function to bounce back ― is thought to slow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T03:02:18.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
