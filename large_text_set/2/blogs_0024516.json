By Sharell Cook Updated January 16, 2016 . \nA convenient and inexpensive way of getting from Mumbai to Goa is by train, via the Konkan Railway. It's much more comfortable than the bus and the scenery is more spectacular. If you take an overnight train, you'll be there the next morning. Most trains take around 12 hours. Book early though, as space fills up fast. What You Should Know The main railway station in Mumbai is the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus) near the Fort area of south Mumbai. Its code is CST. Trains to Goa also depart Mumbai from Lokmanyatilak Terminus, which is in Kurla, in the north eastern suburbs of Mumbai. The main railway station in Goa is Madgaon, also known as Margao (MAO). It's located in south Goa. If you're traveling to the north Goa beaches , try to get a train that stops at Thivim (THVM).
