Will it work? 06:27 Putin, his top officials and his state-controlled media have employed asymmetric techniques at home in a quick pivot from rabid anti-Americanism to rabid anti-Obamaism. That strategy could make it easier to prepare the Russian public for a cozier relationship with the United States under a Trump administration -- if Trump can follow through on his desire to make a \"deal\" with Putin. As Putin plays good cop, his senior officials demean Obama as a failure who tried to harm Russia. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has lambasted Obama's team as \"a group of foreign policy losers, bitter and narrow-minded.\" \"... (T)he American people were humiliated by their own president,\" she said. \"Not by international terrorists, not by enemy troops. This time Washington was slapped by (its) own master, who has complicated the urgent tasks for the incoming team in the extreme.\" The Russian Embassy in London even tweeted a drawing of a duck with the word \"lame\" plastered across its chest. \"Everybody, including [the American] people, will be glad to the see last of this hapless [Administration],\" it read. President Obama expels 35 ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º diplomats in Cold War deja vu. As everybody, incl ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ people, will be glad to see the last of this hapless Adm. pic.twitter.com/mleqA16H8D â€” Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) December 29, 2016 In another technique for putting his opponent off-balance, Putin has denied, in general terms, accusations of Russian hacking in the US election, but subtly tweaking Obama and Democrats, telling the Bloomberg news agency : \"Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data? The important thing is the content that was given to the public.\" Putin has tried to leverage US democracy against itself, criticizing the Electoral College system of deciding elections. \"There is no true democracy there,\" he said atthe Valdai Discussion Club,\"and you are trying to convince us that we are not (democratic)?\" As he assumes the presidency, will Trump see Putin's \"asymmetric diplomacy\" for what it is? Behind the judo moves, Putin is hampered by an economy hit hard by depressed oil prices and by Western economic sanctions. His charm offensive with Trump may last only as long as he thinks he can get what he wants from the new US President.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T10:36:18.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
