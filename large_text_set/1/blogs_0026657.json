Zeke Lau, Makai McNamara and Jamie O’Brien were the three surfers who, in 2016, rose to the occasion of the perfect swell at the 2016 Volcom Pipe Pro and dropped matching perfect 10s. Two of ‘em made the final, an obvious correlation there, and all three showed us surf fans what perfection at Pipe looks like. \nOf course, it’d be greedy to say that anything less than a 10 didn’t do the trick for those of us on the beach or tuned into Red Bull TV . Across the course of the event, the volume of waves surfed in the good- to excellent-range was relatively preposterous, without a hint of criticism for over-scoring being lobbed at the judging booth. The waves set the bar high, and the surfers rose to the occasion — that’s how we ended up with 1:30 of 8s and above to show you.
