The article paints a grim picture of the state of this industry in 2017. Farmers speak to Maher about how they’ve reckoned with these conditions, and what this climate may mean for an industry that's grown gingerly over the past decade.

Maple trees thrive in sub-freezing temperatures overnight, while, during the day, it’s ideal for temperatures to hover in the mid-40s. This kind of weather provokes a freeze-thaw cycle. The dissonance between daytime and nighttime temperatures coaxes sap to travel from the roots of the tree to its upper branches. ♥ + Sugar Pie: The Sweetest Way to Celebrate Maple Season by Miranda Keyes \nBut the wild indecision of 2017’s temperature, and its general warmth so far, is compromising this fertility. Sap has been slow to trickle from these trees. Some of the farmers Maher speaks to harbor cautious optimism, saying there's still some time for course-correction if temperatures dip accordingly at night. But chances are growing slim now that it's nearly spring, and temperatures are getting warmer on the whole. Farmers believe maple syrup yields will be down by 75 percent, as compared to last year. \nThis poses obvious difficulties for farmers whose livelihood is subject to the whims of errant weather. But these conditions could have a domino effect that reaches the consumer pipeline, with prices of that coveted maple syrup rising as demand can’t meet supply. I’m as big a fan of maple syrup as the average person; it works as a great sweetening agent for porridges or pancakes. But I guess it's as good a time as any to cozy up to the alternatives—imagine a drizzle of molasses, a rich compote , a hearty jam on your pancakes.
