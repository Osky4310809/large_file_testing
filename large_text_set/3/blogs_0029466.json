It now has locations in the East and West Village , as well as a shake shop inside Gansevoort Market and a storefront in Philadelphia. \nEarlier this week, Big Gay Ice Cream started selling pint versions of some its favorites, including the Salty Pimp, on Fresh Direct and Amazon and will soon be rolling out in markets. \n\"It's going to be an exciting summer at the Seaport and we're thrilled to welcome Big Gay Ice Cream,\" said Cristina Carlson, a Howard Hughes spokeswoman. \nBig Gay Ice Cream did not return request for comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:15:26.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
