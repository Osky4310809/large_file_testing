Vehicles bought until then can however be registered even in the month of April.\nWith everyone on a rampage, dealerships are offering massive discounts of sticker prices with thousands of bikes up for clearance. The deals so far, include up to Rs 20,000 off on two-wheelers (much higher for litre-class bikes) and up to Rs 50,000- Rs 1,00,000 lakh off on cars.\nBelow is a list of BS-III motorcycles that can be purchased at low prices, but only by end of day.\nManufacturer Model name Showroom Price in Rupees (may vary by state and variant) Discount As per manufacturer in Rupees Honda Activa 50,730-68,498 12,500-14,500 Aviator 57,000-61,000 12,500-14,500 Dio 48,671 12,500-14,500 Honda Dream Yuga 51,741 18,500 Honda CB Shine 61,283 18,500 Honda CD 110DX 47,494 18,500 Honda CBR 150 1,23,183 22,000 Honda CBR 250 1,60,904 22,000 Hero MotoCorp Hero Duet 49,480 12,500 Hero Glamour 59,755 12,500 Hero Maestro Edge 51,030 12,500 Hero Splendour 55,575 12,500 Suzuki Motorcycle India Suzuki Gixxer 77,452 5,000+2,000 exchange Suzuki Lets 53,766 4,000 Bajaj Auto Bajaj Platina 48,000 5,000 Bajaj Discover 125 52,588 5,000 Bajaj V 12 56,283 5,000 Bajaj V 15 62,133 5,000 Bajaj Avenger Street 150 78,988 7,000 Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220 87,331 7,000 Bajaj Avenger Street 220 87,331 7,000 Bajaj Pulsar 79,486-94,630 3,000 -12,000 Mahindra Mahindra Centuro 48000 15,000 Mahindra Mojo 169871 25,000 Mahindra Gusto 53010 15,000 The post BS-III vehicle ban: Here is a list of discounted motorcycles and scooters at attractive prices appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:40:59.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
