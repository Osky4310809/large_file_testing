According to Deepak, Sasikala assuming charge in Jayalalithaa's place is not acceptable to the people of Tamil Nadu. He insists that he and his sister Deepa are the rightful legal heirs of J Jayalalithaa. By: Swapna Raghu Sanand | Published: February 24, 2017 3:34 PM Deepak Jayakumar. Picture Credit: Youtube \nThe fight for keeping alive Jayalalithaa’s is not over yet and the battle lines are drawn more tightly than ever before. Deepak Jayakumar, Jayalalithaa’s nephew, has come out to stake a claim on his aunt’s properties which includes Veda Nilayam in Poes Garden. According to Deepak, Sasikala assuming charge in Jayalalithaa’s place is not acceptable to the people of Tamil Nadu. He insists that he and his sister Deepa are the rightful legal heirs of J Jayalalithaa. Speaking to local TV channels, he raised questions about the reinduction of TTV Dinakaran as AIADMK’s deputy general secretary. At the same time, Deepa Jayakumar, his sister, told reporters, “I don’t want Poes Garden.” \nWith OPS almost vanishing, MK Stalin taking legal recourse to topple Palanisami’s government and Deepak Jayakumar staking claim on Jayalalithaa’s properties, there is much drama that awaits the state that wants good governance but seems to be at the receiving end of good theatrical performances instead. When will the drama end and the curtains close? We don’t know. But one thing is clear – the battle for Tamil Nadu is still not over yet. In a way, it has only just begun. \nAlso Watch: \nIn Tamil Nadu, the iconic political leaders that are linked with the Dravidian movement include MGR and Jayalalithaa. They are not merely political figures but they are a part of the folklore of every village dotting the state. You cannot live in Tamil Nadu and not be affected by the almost mythological characteristics that are attributed to these leaders. The dramatic rise of Jayalalithaa against all odds transformed her into a larger-than-life political figure. The fact that she had been humiliated because she was a woman stood in her favour and when she took a vow to avenge the humiliation, she rewrote Tamil Nadu’s history with that one ‘Draupadi’-like stance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:22:04.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
