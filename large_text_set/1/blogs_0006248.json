Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Tory minister today batted aside the British Red Cross's dire warning that the NHS is facing a \"humanitarian crisis\". \nThe disaster relief charity was called in last week to help an NHS hospital, plus the East Midlands Amublance Service, as damning figures showed overloaded A&Es shut their doors 42 times in a week. \nBut confident Justine Greening claimed that's \"not particularly unusual\" and branded the charity's comments \"inappropriate\". \n\"I don’t think it’s appropriate to describe it as a ‘humanitarian crisis',\" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Read More NHS calls in British Red Cross as A&Es forced to shut their doors 42 times in one week \n\"We know the challenges the NHS face... And of course we also know that at this time of year in particular there are additional pressures on the NHS.\" \nPrime Minister Theresa May added: \"I don’t accept the description the Red Cross has made of this.\" \nPressed on reports two patients at one hospital died after long waits on trolleys, she insisted Red Cross aid was \"not particularly unusual\". Red Cross staff and volunteers have been helping NHS services (file photo) (Photo: AFP) \n\"It’s not unusual for the Red Cross - and indeed of course St John’s Ambulance helps the health service the every single day,\" she added. \nThe last widespread reports of Red Cross aid in the NHS were two years ago this week. \nRed Cross staff and volunteers helped matrons at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital from January 1 until Friday, arranging transport for patients and settling them back into their homes. \nThey are in talks with \"a number of other hospitals\" about similar activity, a spokesman said. Two patients have died at Worcestershire Royal Hospital in one week \nThe charity was also called in on New Year's Day to support the East Midlands Ambulance Service, including in Nottingham, Leicester and Northampton. \nBritish Red Cross chief executive Mike Adamson branded the situation a \"humanitarian crisis\". \nHe said: \"We have been called in to support the NHS and help get people home from hospital and free up much needed beds. \n\"This means deploying our team of emergency volunteers and even calling on our partner Land Rover to lend vehicles to transport patients and get the system moving. Tory Justine Greening was not the only person criticising the dire warning \n\"We’ve seen people sent home without clothes, some suffer falls and are not found for days, while others are not washed because there is no carer there to help them. \n\"We call on the UK government to allocate immediate funding to stabilise the current system and set out plans towards creating a sustainable funding settlement for the future.\" \nThe backlash against his comments was joined yesterday by Professor Keith Willett, NHS England's director of acute care. \nProf Willett said that \"on the international scale of a humanitarian crisis, I do not think the NHS is at that point\". \nHe continued: \"Clearly, demand is at the highest level ever. But also our planning is probably more comprehensive than it has ever been. \nBut Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"This is a national scandal – and Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt have to take both responsibility and urgent action to tackle it. \n\"I’m grateful to the Red Cross volunteers who have stepped in during this emergency, as well as the hard working NHS staff who are being let down and undermined by this government. \n\"But we should not have to rely on the Red Cross to provide the basic care the people of this country need.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T13:11:24.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
