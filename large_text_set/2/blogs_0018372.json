In a photo recently posted to his Instagram account, the former Phillies star looks like a cross between a power lifter and an Old Testament prophet. While the photo calls attention to his beard, check out Hamels' arms: \nA post shared by Cole Hamels (@colehamels) on Feb 19, 2017 at 5:04pm PST \nHamels, who has two years remaining on the seven-year, $159 million contract he signed with the Phillies in 2012, is coming off one of the most impressive seasons of his career, a campaign in which he logged 200 2/3 innings with a 3.32 ERA, 9.0 K/9, 3.5 BB/9, and 1.1 HR/9 while pitching in one of the less-pitcher-friendly home environments in baseball. Hamels did struggle in the Rangers’ sweep at the hands of the Blue Jays in the American League division series. \nWhether bearded or clean-shaven, Hamels has quietly established himself as a guy who could make a serious Hall of Fame case over the next few seasons. \nConsider this: \nSince 1995, the first year after the strike, four pitchers have at least eight seasons of 200+ innings and an ERA of less than 3.66: \nTom Glavine (8) \nThose with seven: Roy Oswalt, Roy Halladay, Mike Mussina, Greg Maddux. \nAmong pitchers with at least 2000 innings pitched since 1995, here are the ERA+ leaders: \n1. Pedro Martinez 15615. Mike Mussina 120 \n| Updated: our guidelines | Comments FAQ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:12:34.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
