Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley has vowed that he will filibuster Trump’s nomination, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated he is on board with that. \nRepublicans only have 52 seats in the Senate, so in addition to Manchin, seven other Democrats would need to join all Republicans to reach the 60-vote threshold necessary to end any filibuster . \nPolitico reported that after Trump announced his nominee, Manchin, whose state went for Trump in November and is considered to be vulnerable in the upcoming 2018 elections, appeared willing to give Gorsuch a fair hearing.

And two wrongs don’t make a right.” \nManchin also stated that he isn’t in favor of the so-called “nuclear option,” which would do away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees and require only a simply majority of 51 votes to advance Gorsuch’s nomination. \nIt was unclear if Manchin truly wants to work across the aisle or was adopting this posture only because he was worried about his re-election chances in 2018. \nDemocrats have done everything they can so far to slow the confirmations of Trump’s cabinet nominees , and there is no reason to believe that they won’t do the same thing for his Supreme Court nominee.
