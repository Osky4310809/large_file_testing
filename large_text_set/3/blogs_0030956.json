Three died and dozens were injured when he drove a vehicle into pedestrians on Westminster bridge before leaving the car and fatally stabbing a police officer outside parliament. \nHe was shot dead by police at the scene.

This revelation contradicted earlier media reports that Masood, previously known as Adrian Ajao, was influenced by Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIL/ISIS). \n“His attack method appears to be based on low sophistication, low tech, low cost techniques copied from other attacks, and echo the rhetoric of ISIS leaders in terms of methodology and attacking police and civilians, but at this stage I have no evidence he discussed this with others,\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said in a statement. \nREAD MORE: Women form human chain to honor victims of Westminster terrorist attack (PHOTOS, VIDEO) \n“There is no evidence that Masood was radicalized in prison in 2003, as has been suggested; this is pure speculation at this time. Whilst I have found no evidence of an association with IS or AQ [Al-Qaeda], there is clearly an interest in jihad,” Basu added. \nInvestigators said Masood’s “ communications” on the day of the attack are the “main line of enquiry”. DAC Basu “I know when, where & how Masood committed his atrocities, now I need to know why. Most importantly, so do the victims & families” — Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) March 27, 2017 \nMeanwhile, Masood’s mother, Janet Ajao, has said she is \"shocked, saddened and numbed\" by his actions. Ajao told the BBC she had \"shed many tears for the people caught up in this horrendous incident.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:24:11.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
