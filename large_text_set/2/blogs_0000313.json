Could   \nJohn Terry has hailed Frank Lampard as Chelsea's greatest ever player after the former Blues midfielder announced his retirement. \nLampard, 38, brought the curtain down on his illustrious career on Thursday, after a 21-year senior career. \nThirteen of those years were spent at Stamford Bridge, after Lampard's Â£11million move from West Ham in 2001. \nHe departed in 2014 as the club's all-time record goalscorer and having landed a host of honours, including three English titles, four FA Cups and the 2012 Champions League. RATHBORN: Lampard was unique - there will never be another midfielder like him \n\"The GREATEST player in the history of our great football club,\" Terry wrote on Instagram. \n\"All the great memories together winning trophy after trophy year after year I will never forget. You have won everything and should be extremely proud. \n\"It's been my pleasure and honour to play and experience all those great moments with you. \n\"A gentleman both on and off the pitch, leader in the dressing room and if I could choose one person next to me in the trenches it would be you. \n\"A great dad to your two beautiful girls and I'm proud to call you my mate. Good Luck for the future, whatever you choose to do will be a huge success. Love Ya Lampsy. \n\"LEGEND HERO INSPIRATION + THE BEST EVER.\" FA Cup winners together in 2007 (Photo: Getty Images Sport Classic) Lampard and Terry were again winners in 2012 (Photo: The FA via Getty Images) \nThe 36-year-old defender described the dedication which marked Lampard's career. \n\"The best trainer by a million miles every single day, inspiring me and everyone at the club,\" Terry added. \n\"I miss you next to me in the dressing room and miss you grabbing a bag of balls after training when everyone went inside. \n\"You stayed out working on your finishing, 20 goals a year wasn't good enough for you, every year you wanted 25,30 goals. \n\"I love that about you. I will miss you getting 4 cones and doing sprints after training - setting the example for the kids in the academy.\" Trophies of all shapes and sizes were won together (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nThree-time Premier League winner revealed earlier this week that he has begun studying for his coaching badges with the help of FA technical director Dan Ashworth. \nLampard, 38, could now be in line for a place within the England set up at youth level, after beginning working on his 'B' licence. \nEx-Blues striker Didier Drogba also took to social media to praise Lampard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:48:56.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
