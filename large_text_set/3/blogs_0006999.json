The update weighs in at 1.3GB, and it appears to be reaching Vodafone customers in the U.K. first, as well as those in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com Given that the Galaxy S6 series is almost two years old now, it has had to wait in line for its Nougat upgrade while Samsung focuses on updating more recent handsets, like the Galaxy S7 series. However, with no need to use resources on Galaxy Note 7 support anymore, Samsung has been able to deliver Nougat for the Galaxy S6 quicker than it might have.\nLike the Galaxy S7 upgrade, Nougat for the Galaxy S6 brings user experience improvements, tweaks to the TouchWiz interface, and a whole host of performance and stability enhancements. Users can also look forward to improvements to features like multi-window, Samsung Pass, and Quick Settings inside the notification shade.\nIt’s unclear whether this update is focused on Europe initially, but we’re yet to see reports of it reaching devices in the U.S. or other markets. It’s likely Samsung will be testing the waters in one region ahead of a wider rollout when it is sure there are no issues that need addressing.\nHave you received Nougat on your Galaxy S6 or S6 edge yet?
