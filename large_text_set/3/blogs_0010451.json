The company didn’t disclose a whole lot in the way of technical details, merely stating the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid will offer an all-electric driving range in excess of 64 km, with a petrol-hybrid range extender mode. \nIt also adds that the plug-in hybrid model will be launched in all 50 states in the US, while the Clarity Electric will be the “first affordable, midsize, five-passenger battery electric vehicle (BEV).” \nAside from that, each Clarity model will feature a wide aerodynamic body with unique design elements, Display Auto with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, Honda Sensing safety suite, and other driver assistance technologies.
