Mar Bella Beach \nMar Bella has a a nudist stretch, part of which is discreetly partitioned off by a big dune beside the windsfurfing centre. It's also a favourite hang-out for gays and lesbians. \nOn Sundays throughout summer there's late-night raves. Image: Miguel Perez (Creative Commons/Some Rights Reserved) 5. Ocata Beach \nNorth of Barcelona, Ocata is quiet, pristine and very flat, with oodles of space on the beautiful golden white sand. It's a half-hour trip on the train out of the city. Image: Fdhzt (Creative Commons/Some Rights Reserved) 6. Caldetes Beach \nIf you're looking for no-frills beach action, this is the one. Although it's only a short ride north of the city centre, Caldetes is comparatively deserted. \nRead more about Caldetes Beach . Image: Saul Gordillo (Creative Commons/Some Rights Reserved) 7. St Pol de Mar Beach \nSt Pol de Mar is an hour's train journey out of the city, but it's got a gorgeous beach lapped by clear water and backed by pretty hills. Best of all is the enchanting cove - which has become a nudist zone - next to the rain tunnel. Image: Gavin Gilmour (Creative Commons/Some Rights Reserved) 8. Castelldefels Beach \nIt's only fifteen minutes south of the city centre and enjoys five kilometers of tempting sand. The downside is it's as busy as the city centre beaches. \nRead more about Castelldefels Beach Image: Oarranzli (Creative Commons/Some Rights Reserved) 9. Garraf Beach \nFive minutes by train from Castelldefells is Garraf, whose beach is considerably quieter. It's easily accessed from the station and has good facilities.

Sitges Beach \nHalf an hour away from Barcelona city centre, gay-friendly Sitges' city centre sands are pristine but can get noisy and quite windy, while the area to the north of the seafront church is better sheltered and a bit quieter. \nRead about how to get from Barcelona to Sitges . 11. Further afield in Catalonia \nCalella de Palafrugell \nIt can get packed in high summer but, hemmed in between cliffs and a pretty fishing village, Calella's beach has one of Catalonia's most attractive seaside settings. \nAltafulla Beach \nA ten-minute train ride from Tarragona, Altafulla is one of the highlights of the Costa Daurada, with miles of white sand and a gorgeous, secluded cove beneath a ruined Roman fort. \nCala Llevadò \nSteep, golden cliffs, marvellous crystal clear waters and one of Catalonia's best campsites. Cala Llevadò is located on the Costa Brava, between Tossa and Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava. \nTossa de Mar \nTossa might have a cheap 'n' cheery package holiday reputation, but its beaches are easily as good as anything in Catalonia, presided over by a medieval castle on the southern bluffs. \nCala de Sant Francesc \nJust north of Blanes is this pristine spot surrounded by exclusive villas perched in the pine woods. \nSant Lluìs \nIf in search of something a little wilder try this pebbly beach, situated in the volcanic otherworld of Cap de Creus Natural Park. A short walk from Cadaquès, the beach is reached via a stony scramble through olive woods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:52:46.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
