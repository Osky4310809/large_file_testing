Gubarev was named in the dossier as a Russian government agent who coordinated hacks of Democrats during the presidential campaign. \nGubarev strongly denies the charge and is suing BuzzFeed, its editor Ben Smith, and Christopher Steele, the ex-British spy who compiled the dossier, for defamation for including his name in the document. \nIn a phone interview Cobb said that “a pretty wide net” will be cast in the discovery phase of the suit. That could lead to the revelation of a few key questions about the anti-Donald Trump dossier, including the identities of the donors behind the document, the sources of the information contained in it, and the extent of BuzzFeed’s investigation into the dossier’s claims. \n“We want to know how, why and when this story came on board,” Cobb said in an interview on Thursday about his legal strategy for the case. \n“We want to know the extent to which they took any journalistic actions to verify the story before just posting it,” he said of BuzzFeed.

How am I even a part of this story?'” was Gubarev’s response, Cobb said. \nGubarev’s name and that of his company are now blacked out on the BuzzFeed document. But the website added the redaction and apologized to Gubarev only after the lawsuit was filed. Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, 1996 C-SPAN interview. \nThere are a number of questions remaining about the dossier, including the identities of the original patrons for the anti-Trump dirt-digging project and the identity of the sources of the information contained in the document. \nThe discovery phase in the lawsuit will attempt to reveal that information, said Cobb. \nSteele, the ex-spook who compiled the dossier, had been hired by Fusion GPS, a Washington, D.C.-based private intelligence firm. \nFusion GPS, which was founded by former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson, was initially hired in Sept. 2015 by an anti-Trump Republican donor. After Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the Republican donor dropped the project. But a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton’s emerged to fill the void, and Steele was hired.

The dossier also circulated around the Beltway journalism world, but all outlets declined to publish it — until BuzzFeed did so — because the claims in it could not be verified. \nBuzzFeed claims it attempted to run down some of the allegations in the dossier but could not confirm any. \nThe identities of the donors of the dossier have yet to be disclosed. A foreign reporter who was given the dossier by Fusion GPS told TheDC that the firm shared the identity of the Republican donor but refused to do so regarding the identity of the Democratic backer. \nThe information behind the initial redactions has not been made public and repeated requests to Fusion GPS have gone unanswered. \nDavid Corn, a Mother Jones reporter who saw the dossier before the election and interviewed Steele , declined to share information about the redactions with TheDC. \nPaul Wood, a BBC journalist who was provided a copy of the dossier by Fusion GPS, told TheDC that the version he saw already had redactions. \nBuzzFeed added all of the redactions contained in its published version, TheDC has learned. BuzzFeed declined to say what information was blacked out and why, but did defend its decision to publish the dossier. \n“These reports continue to reaffirm the newsworthiness of the dossier we published last month, the contents of which remain under active investigation by US intelligence, law enforcement, and the media,” said Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for BuzzFeed. \nIt is possible that a Belarusian national with Russian business ties named Sergei Millian is listed behind some of the redactions. \nIf so, that could pose further problems for the veracity of some of the claims in the document given Millian’s business activities in the U.S. \nMillian was identified by The Wall Street Journal and ABC News as the source for the two most explosive claims in the dossier. The news outlets reported that they learned of the identity through someone who was familiar with the original document.

(via Facebook) \nABC reported that Millian, whose real name is Siarhei Kukuts and sometimes goes by Sergio, may have “unwittingly” provided the information attached to his name in the dossier to a source of Steele’s. \nCorn, the Mother Jones reporter who interviewed Steele, published an article several days before Millian was named encouraging federal investigators to interview him. \nDuring the campaign, Millian, who runs a small trade group called the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, claimed in several interviews to have close business connections to Trump. He said he helped broker real estate deals between Trump and Russian nationals. He also claimed to have ties to the Kremlin. \nBut in an interview with TheDC last month, Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, called Millian “a phony” who falsely portrayed himself as a close associate of Trump’s. He also said that he has never met Millian and only talked to him twice. \nCohen was named in the dossier as a Trump adviser who met with Russian government officials in Prague in August to discuss ways to influence the election. He was also named in the same paragraph that identified Gubarev. \nBut Cohen strongly denied the accusations and provided evidence he was in the U.S. at the time he was allegedly in Prague. A U.S. government official also told CNN’s Jake Tapper that a different Michael Cohen is believed to have met in Prague. \nMillian has issued vague denials regarding the dossier, and it is entirely possible that someone falsely identified him to Steele as a source for the salacious Trump claims. But Millian has ignored numerous requests for an interview. He did agree to talk to TheDC at one point but did not follow through with an interview. \nCNN has reported that federal investigators have corroborated some parts of the dossier, but not the most salacious sections. \nGubarev’s lawsuit can potentially help corroborate or disprove others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:42:33.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
