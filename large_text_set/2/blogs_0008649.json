How is she real? \nThe 35-year-old singer is nominated for nine Grammy Awards tonight for her visual album Lemonade , including Album, Record and Song of the Year. \nShe’s picked up two wins for best music video for “Formation” and Best Urban Contemporary Album so far, but as far as I’m concerned, the live performance she gave won every award that has ever existed. Bey came out dressed in a long, golden gown and a crown that reaffirmed her status as the queen.

Finally, she brought the house down with a beautiful performance of her ballad “Sandcastles.” Beyoncé performing Sandcastles RT to save a life \n— Molly Alvine (@Pop_that_mollyy) February 13, 2017 Jay Z was obviously incredibly proud to be married to such royalty.

Blue Ivy's reaction to her mom @beyonce 's #GRAMMYs performance is TOO CUTE FOR WORDS pic.twitter.com/wbCA6qva12 \nAND THAT’S HOW YOU SLAY A GRAMMYS PERFORMANCE WITH TWO BABIES INSIDE YOU. \nThis whole religious experience was preceded by an introduction from Beyoncé’s mom, Tina Lawson. \nShe said, \nWhat makes me most proud and why why I’m here tonight to introduce Beyoncé is the devotion and love I see in her for my daughter, and the way she has always expressed love to all of those around her. I believe she earned nine Grammy nominations for her Lemonade album because of all of that and more. It’s evident in her powerful words and music. \nCan you imagining raising your child and having the child turn into BEYONCÉ? \nSeriously, well done, Tina. Well done.
