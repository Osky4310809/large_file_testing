After all, there's not much you can do about it, right? \nDon't let this new attack go unnoticed. A newly reported data breach that went undetected for six months at the world's largest payment system manufacturer, which processes payments for Visa and Mastercard, can affect you for months or years to come. \nVerifone recently confirmed that its internal network had been hacked. Although the company has downplayed the hack, it's a serious breach that deserves more attention. \nVerifone said about two dozen point-of-sale payment systems at gas stations were targeted. POS systems, like the ones hacked at Target that led to data from 40 million cards being stolen in 2013, are where you swipe or insert your debit card or credit card. \nVerifone has said in a statement that this attack was contained. However, while Verifone may be downplaying this data breach, the hack gets scarier as more details come to light.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T08:24:48.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
