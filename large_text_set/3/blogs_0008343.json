Imagine if previous presidents had done the same.\nIn February, border agents apprehended just 18,762 people at the U.S./Mexican border, a 40% drop from January, which was itself a 27% decline from December. In fact, illegal border crossings have fallen every month since Trump won the election. And February's number was lower than any month in the previous five years, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\"This trend is encouraging because it means many fewer people are putting themselves and their families at risk of exploitation, assault and injury by human traffickers and the physical dangers of the treacherous journey north,\" said Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly .\nAnother clear sign that things have changed: Smuggling fees have skyrocketed. Since November 2016, \"coyotes\" — smugglers that help illegal entrants cross the border — have hiked their fees in some areas by about 130%, Kelly said.\nAnd this is before Trump has been able to implement any of his policies (most of which, by the way, the IBD/TIPP poll finds are very popular with the public ). Construction on the wall hasn't started. Trump hasn't hired the 5,000 Border Patrol agents or the 10,000 immigration officers, or built the new detention centers near the border.\nAll Trump has done so far is talk tough and promise to strictly enforce the laws already on the books. \"We do not need new laws,\" Trump said at one point. \"We will work within the existing system and framework.\" In this case, the main law he's relying on is the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which serves as the basis for most of the elements in Trump's executive orders on border security.\nThat did mean ending policies adopted by the Obama administration that were designed to hamper enforcement of existing laws or otherwise made it excessively easy for border crossers to remain in the U.S. — such as \"catch and release\" — and that encouraged border crossers. In fact, the zenith in border apprehensions occurred in mid 2014, when Obama was talking up his plans for an executive order granting amnesty to millions of illegals.\nEven Trump's fiercest critics have been forced to admit, however grudgingly, that his use of the bully pulpit has been effective, as the virulently anti-Trump New York Times did when it said the sharp drop in border crossings \"could let (Trump) take credit for quickly making good on his promise to clamp down on illegal immigration.\"\nFor these numbers to continue on the downtrend, however, Trump will have to live up to his rhetoric. But he doesn't have to wait for \"comprehensive immigration reform\" to do so.\nThis rapid decline in border crossings also reveals something much more troubling: the dereliction of duty on the part of previous administrations to take illegal immigration seriously.\nAfter all, if tough rhetoric alone can have an impact on illegal immigration, why does the country currently have more than 11 million illegals living here today? The main reason appears to be that previous presidents — most notably Obama — failed to vigorously enforce these laws.\nNo wonder Trump faces so much hostility from the establishment when it comes to his immigration policies. By finally getting tough on this issue and showing immediate results, Trump is also exposing the incredible irresponsibility of his predecessors.\nRELATED: \nDemocrats Attack Trump For Enforcing Their Own Immigration Law \nAre We Going To Freak Out Every Time Trump Does What He Promised? \nTrump News & Tweets \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:25:55.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
