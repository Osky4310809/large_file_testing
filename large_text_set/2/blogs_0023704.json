Credit J. Kyle Keener/The Pharos-Tribune, via Associated Press The police in Delphi, Ind., have released a secretly recorded audio and a photograph of a man suspected in the killings of two teenage girls who disappeared while on a hiking trip near an abandoned rail bridge last week. In the audio, taken from video that one of the girls, Liberty Rose Lynn German, 14, recorded on her cellphone when she and her friend Abigail J. Williams, 13, went missing earlier this month in a wooded area, a man can be heard saying, “Down the hill.” Law enforcement officials in Delphi, a city of around 3,000 residents about 60 miles north of Indianapolis, released the excerpt on Wednesday, hoping that someone might recognize the voice. Officials are also investigating whether the voice belonged to the man seen in footage discovered on Liberty’s phone after the bodies of both girls were found on Feb. 14. The police called the older girl a “hero” for having the courage to make the recording. Here is what officials have said about the case: Disappearance during school break Liberty, who was called Libby, and Abigail, known as Abby, were both eighth-grade students at Delphi Community Middle School. They were on the last day of a four-day winter break when they left on a hiking trip o n Monday, Feb. 13 , the superintendent of Delphi’s schools, Gregory G. Briles, said in an interview on Thursday. \n  At approximately 1 p.m., the girls set off near the Monon High Bridge , a historical abandoned rail bridge near a 10-mile park trail known as the Delphi Historic Trail, “to walk around and hang out,” the Indiana State Police said. They had made plans to be picked up later in the afternoon. When they did not show up , a family member called the authorities, and search parties were organized , the police said. The next day, counselors and staff members were deployed to the middle school to provide support for students, Mr. Briles said.
