John Yarmuth on @MSNBC : \"This is not somebody, in my mind, who is emotionally stable enough to be President.\" https://t.co/4CUBJCSAsS pic.twitter.com/jAuTnzBeYL \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 13, 2017 \nAnother Democratic legislator has now publicly opined on the subject of President Trump ‘s mental stability. \nCongressman John Yarmuth said a few weeks ago , “I’m not sure of his mental state, but I know that he doesn’t portray someone who is in control of his facilities.” \nWhen asked about that on MSNBC today, Yarmuth said the following: \n“We have a president who’s up all night, who’s tweeting at all kinds of crazy hours, who’s making unsubstantiated claims that are really dangerous, who’s concerned himself with trivial matters like the ratings of The Apprentice ––this is not somebody, in my mind, who is emotionally stable enough to be President of the United States. I have real serious concerns about this.” \nSenator Al Franken claimed recently that Republicans are privately expressing their concerns about Trump’s mental health. \nYou can watch Yarmuth’s remarks above, via MSNBC. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:06:25.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
