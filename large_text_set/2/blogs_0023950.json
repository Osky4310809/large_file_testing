They say he put two different Maynard neighborhoods on edge by placing homemade bombs near houses. \nHe was ordered held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing in Concord District Court Wednesday. William O’Neil is charged with possessing and placing and explosive device. (Maynard Police) \nHe was arrested at his home around 5:30 a.m., two days after a neighbor called 911 to report a suspicious package left on his porch. \n“We don’t have a motive at this point,” said Maynard Police Chief Mark Dubois. “It did seem random. That’s something that I think they’ll continue to try to figure out. \nNear O’Neil’s home, one neighbor simply said “good” when told O’Neil was arrested. \nPolice said he left the most recent bomb in a neighborhood full of kids, a block away from his home. \nHeather Hunt and her son Noel recently moved to the area, and she found the arrest disturbing. \n“It’s frightening to think that he could stumble upon something and get really hurt,” Hunt said of her son. \nThe Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad rendered that device safe, and authorities said a fingerprint found on that device linked it to O’Neil.

That device was detonated. \nPolice said they’ve had several minor run-ins with O’Neil, but bombs left at houses were a new level. \n“We’re very lucky,” said Chief Dubois. “Both of these devices had the potential to seriously injure somebody.” \nThe devices were described as small cylinders full of propane with an ignition device. \nO’Neil has been employed by the Weston DPW for years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:47:10.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
