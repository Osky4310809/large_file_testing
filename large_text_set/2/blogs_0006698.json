They are very difficult to beat and they have been clear in the things that they have to do. (Photo: Getty) \n\"I think they deserve to be first, to be honest.” \nHerrera, who has been a key figure in United’s 15-game unbeaten run in the league since that drubbing, stopped short of conceding the title to Chelsea. \nBut the Spain midfielder did admit that United’s focus is on securing a top-four spot despite being into the last 16 of the FA Cup, as holders, and the Europa League's 32-team knockout phase. \nUnited have failed to qualify for the Champions League in two of the last three seasons and Herrera accepts they cannot miss out again.
