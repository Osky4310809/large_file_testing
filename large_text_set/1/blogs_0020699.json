She famously voiced her strong opinions at the Women’s March in Washington DC. And while she used some colorful language, her passion and message of love were clear.\nIn response to her outspoken views, a Texas radio station has decided to ban Madonna’s music . HITS 105 issued a formal media statement on their Facebook page that explains their reasoning . They claim that the singer shows “un-American sentiments.” And they claim that they would feel un-patriotic by continuing to play her music and pay her royalties .\n& MEDIA RELEASEJanuary 24th 2017TEXARKANA RADIO STATION BANS MADONNATexarkana s Classic Hits station HITS 105 is...\nPosted by HITS 105fm on  Tuesday, January 24, 2017 Of course, radio stations already curate their music to what they believe their listeners want. But banning Madonna’s pop hits based on the singer’s political stances seems like a pretty major reaction.\nIt’s one thing to choose your station’s music based on musical tastes. But it’s a completely different level to choose not to play music based on the artist’s personal beliefs.\n\nWe connect to each other through music. And while not everyone listens to the same music or has the same tastes, obviously, it’s something we can all enjoy. If other stations start following suit and choosing only to play music from artist’s whose political views they agree with, it could greatly change the music scene.\nFolks who listen to the Texarkana station who love Madonna’s music could protest the decision by constantly calling and requesting her songs. Madonna’s iconic music inspires so many people. To take away the ability to hear it based on her outspoken beliefs that others may or may not agree with seems like a pretty extreme stance to take, and a dangerous precedent to set.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:10:37.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
