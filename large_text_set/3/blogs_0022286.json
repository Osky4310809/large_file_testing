Orrin Hatch and Republican Virginia Rep. Morgan Griffith and has already attracted multiple co-sponsors. The bill also has the support of both the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation. \n“This bill safeguards our Second Amendment rights by strengthening federal protections for responsible gun owners traveling across state lines,” Hatch explained in a news release from his office. “By amending the Firearms Owners’ Protection Act of 1986, this common-sense proposal puts an end to the harassment of upstanding citizens who happen to stay overnight, fuel up or stop for an emergency during their travels in another state.” \n“I believe it is important to defend the Second Amendment right of law-abiding gun owners,” Griffith said. “Current federal law or the Second Amendment of the Constitution should neither be misinterpreted nor ignored to prevent law-abiding, responsible gun owners from traveling throughout the country with firearms so long as they are in compliance with federal law while in transit.” Advertisement - story continues below \nChris Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action, praised the bill by declaring, “This legislation will restore the intent of Congress to protect law-abiding Americans who exercise their fundamental Second Amendment rights when they travel.” \nHis words were echoed by Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel of the NSSF, who stated, “We support this legislation because it will ensure that law-abiding gun owners will not unwittingly be in violation of varying state laws when they travel across state lines to hunt or participate in a shooting sports activities.” \nThe legislation would essentially state that, provided an individual is not otherwise prohibited by federal law from possessing or transporting a firearm or intending to commit some sort of crime, he would not be in violation of varying state-level laws while transporting a firearm as long as the firearm was kept unloaded and in a separate vehicle compartment or locked in a container. \nSadly, this bill has become necessary as some over-zealous law enforcement officials and prosecutors in states with strict gun control have put law-abiding gun owners through the legal wringer merely for crossing through their states with firearms, even though no crime had been committed.
