Saffaa said she believed the vandalism was fuelled by a political climate of rising anti-Muslim sentiment. Ms Saffaa, protest art and the fledgling Saudi Arabia women's rights movement Read more \n“I almost wanted to cry ... it’s quite disheartening,” said Saffaa, a Saudi-Australian artist. She expected the work to be tagged by other street or graffiti artists, but says the extensive defacing had more aggressive overtones. \nThe self-funded work, which went up in December, took months of preparation and ten eight-hour days to complete, she said. \n“I feel like it’s not just an attack on me but them too,” she said, referring to the Saudi women represented in her work. “What do I tell these women? You have to fight the misogynist men back home and the Islamophobic racist bigots in this country?” \nThe mural forms part of the #iammyownguardian campaign, a movement protesting Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system which prohibits women from travelling, marrying or even leaving prison without the permission of a male guardian. Saffaa’s imagery – featuring a face shrouded in the Saudi shemagh – became emblematic of the movement. \nCrabapple said the work was a reflection of the complexity of the Muslim western experience that challenged conservatives on both sides of the spectrum. \n“I couldn’t decide if the perpetrators were Islamist misogynists, infuriated by the mural’s opposition to Saudi Arabia’s male guardianship system – or Islamophobic racists, infuriated by the mural’s depictions of proud Middle Eastern women and assertion of multifaceted Muslim identities,” she said. \n“No matter who did it, those who try to blot out art reveal only their own impotence. Censors always lose.” \nThe mural is featured on the wall of Morroccan Deli-cacy cafe, run by feminist activist Hana Assafiri. \nAssafiri, known for hosting public salon-style conversations at her Melbourne restaurants, says she discovered the vandalism as she was opening the cafe on Sunday morning. \n“This is a specific aggressive act against the message of the mural,” she said. \nAssafiri, who employs only women, says vandalism in Melbourne’s progressive inner-city enclave highlighted her fears around security at the restaurant. \nShe also expressed concern at the ripple effect from the election of President Donald Trump in the United States on local artists and communities, particularly the recent executive order barring Muslim migrants and refugees from certain countries from entering the US. \n“That this sort of rubbish and the expression of hate can be had in East Brunswick … it’s a manifestation of an attitude of continued bigotry and hate being fostered in all political climates.” \nSaffaa said she felt “heartbroken and drained” at the prospect of repairing the wall. \n“This has taken its toll on me [but] of course I will redo it bigger and better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:10:01.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
