Despite building a muscular physique, Mastrogiacomo is still haunted by his childhood insecurities.\n“I used to tell myself I wasn’t good enough. I’ve never had serious relationships. I never thought someone would want me long-term, as a teen it was tough. There were limitations like not going to the beach or taking my shirt off,” Mastrogiacomo told Caters.\nMastrogiacomo, who trains five days per week, says he looks great with a T-shirt on, yet he still fears exposing his chest.\n“I can feel them swaying around. It feels like an alien on my body,” Mastrogiacomo said of his man breasts.\n“I do still feel insecure even when people tell me I look great. I’ve grown a body dysmorphia in a way,” said Mastrogiacomo, adding that surgery would be the final part of his physical transformation.\nMastrogiacomo started a GoFundMe page with a goal of $9,000 to help him raise enough money for surgery before his first amateur MMA fight in July.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:40:32.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
