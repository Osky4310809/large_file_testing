Share Save \nYou no longer need an HTC Vive to scale Mount Everest in VR on your PC. Sólfar Studios and RVX have released Everest VR for the Oculus Rift , bringing the virtual ascent to Facebook's headset. It'll be familiar if you've tried the Vive version, but a few things have improved since the original launch. There's a new sequence (the Lhotse Face), and an expanded God Mode lets you see the Himalayas from perspectives that aren't possible for a mountaineer. Logically, Oculus Touch support is present if you'd prefer a more hands-on approach. \nYou can download Everest VR right now for $15. As with most VR titles, though, you'll need a reasonably modern Windows PC to handle the Oculus Rift experience. The developers recommend at least a 4th-generation quad Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a GeForce GTX 960 to make the most of it. That won't be too much trouble if you already have a Rift, but it's something to consider if your PC is on the edge of being VR-ready.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:14:20.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
