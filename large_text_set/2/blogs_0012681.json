It was a personal picture, taken on her phone, and not released by her. It was then that she realised that her phone had been hacked into. \nAmy had flown from Chennai to London to finish shooting for 2.0. She had a layover in Mumbai, where she visited a mobile store. It is speculated that the phone was hacked at the store. \nAccording to Mid-Day , \"The phone's automatic sync was on, as a result of which all photographs clicked by her were getting saved on iCloud. She was in her hometown, London, when she couldn't log into her account for a few days and went to a local store for help.\" \nAmy also spoke to the daily. She said that she is planning to lodge a complaint with Mumbai's cyber cell. She also said, \"I was shocked when this happened. This isn't a trivial matter and has to be taken up seriously. I will register a complaint with the cyber crime cell in London and ensure the hackers are taken to task. Cyber safety is the need of the hour.\" \nWe absolutely agree!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:58:08.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
