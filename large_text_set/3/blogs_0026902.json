If 22 Republicans join united Democrats in voting no, the bill will fall short of passage. \nThe House Freedom Caucus, made up of approximately 30 conservative Republicans, currently stands in opposition to the bill, contending it does not do enough to dismantle the structure of ObamaCare, including removing regulations they believe result in higher health care insurance premiums. \nFreedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said on Capitol Hill Thursday afternoon that “we have not gotten enough of our members to get to yes at this point. … However, I would say progress is being made,” Politico reported . \nMeadows praised Trump’s negotiating efforts as he seeks to find the legislative balance needed to bring conservative and moderate Republicans on board.
