Superman did however still manage to snag another four awards—\"Worst Screenplay,\" \"Worst Supporting Actor\" (for Jesse Eisenberg's Zuckerberg-like villain) and \"Worst Screen Combo.\"\nBetween a self-aggrandizing dramatization that makes D'Souza's stint in a white-collar detention center look like an episode of Oz and a strange scene in which Barack Obama's Kenyan father holds a spear while visiting his young son's classroom, there's plenty to cringe at in the pundit's mess of a movie.\nBatman v. Superman , on the other hand, was derided as an overstuffed, pretentious mess that blew through a massive budget for little reward—though it still ranks at a comparatively stellar twenty-seven percent on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\"It all came down to two decidedly different examples of cinematic sludge: The $250 million comic book oop-us 'Batman v Superman' and the faux right wing 'documentary' 'Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party,'\" a Razzies spokesperson said in a statement.\nFor his part, D'Souza actually accepted the award via video, because trolls be trolling, as he told the audience:\n“The reason you’re giving it to me is that you’re very upset that Trump won. You haven’t gotten over it and probably never will.”\nIf you're into, uh, being trolled, you can watch D'Souza's \"acceptance\" speech here (it starts at 5:56):\nThe only two remaining awards went to Kristen Wiig—for her supporting role in Zoolander 2—and Mel Gibson, who earned a special \"redeemer\" award.\nBONUS: Donald Trump's inauguration address included a Bane Quote: ", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/GalXMaRr.m3u8", "http://razzies.com/", "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160721/entlife/160729855/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/GalXMaRr.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-26T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:36:09.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
