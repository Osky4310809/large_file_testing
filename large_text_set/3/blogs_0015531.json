Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe ex-partner of Tilda Swinton has sensationally revealed that he's the child of an incestuous relationship. \nScottish artist and playwright John Byrne, 77, has confessed that his parents were his mother Alice and her own father Patrick McShane - something that he's since described as \"traditional\". \nAccording to a report in The Times , he said: \"I think he gave me that wonderful mixture of genes with his own daughter, the eldest of the family. That's what they do in Ireland. I presume it's what they do in unlettered places, and lettered places. \n\"It's traditional, and nobody speaks about it.\" Tilda Swinton and John Byrne were together until 2005 (Photo: Getty) Highly acclaimed painter and playwright John Byrne (Photo: Daily Record) Read More Guess which British actress has been transformed into an elderly man for her new role \nHe added that he believed the pair were romantically in love. \n\"She was in love with her own father, utterly and totally. She just wanted to be in his company. She couldn't even confess it. My own father [his mum's husband Patrick Byrne] didn't know.\" \nInitially, he revealed that he hated his grandfather for the bombshell revelation, but later said he felt nothing but love for him. \nHe added: \"What did he do to me particularly, that damaged me? I don't think he did damage me.\" \nHe was told the news over the phone by a cousin who called him following a family bereavement. John has since said he felt the relationship between his mother and her father was \"traditional\" (Photo: PA) \nTilda and John haven't been an item since 2005, when she embarked on a relationship with Sandro Kopp. \nThe three of them live together in the Highlands with their twin children, Xavier and Honor. \nKatherine Mathilda Swinton is perhaps best-known for films including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Beach and We Need to Talk About Kevin.
