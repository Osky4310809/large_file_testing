NEW: \"It is totally illegal to steal & publish tax returns\": WH responds to MSNBC's report that it has obtained some of POTUS' 2005 tax info pic.twitter.com/idgTbb1w9o \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) March 15, 2017 \nTrump had promised during the presidential campaign to release his returns — which every presidential nominee in modern times has made into a precedent — after the conclusion of a routine audit, but the White House has not spelled out when exactly that would be. More recently, aides have suggested that since he won the election, he would not release his returns. \nHillary Clinton and Trump’s Republican rivals during the presidential election sought to turn the returns into a campaign issue, but failed to create enough pressure to force their release. \nIn October, The New York Times obtained a single year’s return anonymously that showed that Trump declared a $916 million loss and lists tax benefits he used after a turbulent financial period for him in the early 1990s. The paper, citing tax experts, said Trump could have used his loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income for nearly two decades. \nThe-CNN-Wire & 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
