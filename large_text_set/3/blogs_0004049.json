By Amy B Wang By Amy B Wang March 5 at 4:29 PM Follow @amybwang Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Republican congressional retreat in Philadelphia on Jan. 26, 2017. (Matt Rourke/AP) \nVice President Mike Pence was the highest-ranking government official in attendance Saturday night at the Gridiron dinner, an annual gathering of Washington’s top political journalists. As he has with the upcoming White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, President Trump declined his invitation to the Gridiron event. \nIn a lengthy address, Pence roasted reporters as well as politicians and staff members — Democrats and Republicans — who were at the white-tie affair. He lobbed a few jokes in his own direction, starting with a lighthearted quip about his attire. \n“I thought I’d be okay wearing a black tie tonight,” Pence joked, according to NPR . “Then Nancy Pelosi asked me to refill her coffee.” \nPence wrapped up by issuing a defense of a free press and First Amendment rights. \nBelow is the White House pool report of Pence’s remarks, with our annotations. To see an annotation, click on the highlighted text. \nMIKE PENCE: “I’m pleased to be joined by a number of members of President Trump’s cabinet. And frankly with all of Chuck Schumer’s obstruction, I’m just glad we had enough to fill the head table.” \n“It’s especially great that TV journalists are finally allowed to attend. I see all the major networks are represented here, which makes it easier for me because I only have to say the same thing once.” \nHe noted that MSNBC is here. “But I guess it’s only a matter of time before the rest of show business gets invited.” \n“Speaking of show business, did you all see what happened at the Oscar’s last week? It really was something. They gave out the best picture award to the wrong film . I gotta tell you, we haven’t seen that many shocked Hollywood liberals since, I don’t know, November the eighth?” \nPence said it’s an “honor” to [be] VP to the broad-shouldered and big-hearted Trump as he made fun of himself for repeating the line across networks on Wednesday morning. \n“I actually heard that Bret Baier proposed a drinking game for every time I said those two words tonight, so Brett I hope you got a designated driver.” \nHe joked that Trump asked him to send a message tonight and looked around for it. “’Be friendly’ – no wait, that’s from my wife.” \n“ ‘Remember to pick up some milk on the way home’ – that one is from the president, but it’s not the one I was looking for.” \n“Oh, here it is, it’s on my phone. ‘Mike, thanks for covering the Gridiron dinner. Have a good time. Get some rest this weekend. Next weekend there’s an important ribbon cutting in Antarctica I really need you to cover.’ “ \nNot missing a beat he added: “It really is an honor to be vice president for a man like President Trump.” \nRazzing Sean Spicer, Pence said, “Sean, I really want to apologize that you didn’t get served dinner tonight. … When the waiter asked you what you wanted for your entrée you shouldn’t have said, ‘Sit down, I never called on you.’” \nTalking about the Oval Office, Pence said, “I gotta tell you, every time I look at that portrait of Hamilton, I feel like there’s a lecture coming on.” \nBack on POTUS’ address to Congress: “I even thought I heard Rachel Maddow start to say something nice, but then MSNBC immediately cut to commercial.” [ At the Gridiron dinner, the jokes were on Trump’s Russia connections ] \nOn his email controversy: “The end of the week was a little embarrassing for me. Not that I had a personal email account when I was governor. [It] really was embarrassing for me to have millions of Americans learn that I’m one of the few people in the country to still have an AOL account. \n“My wife said it was good for my image, she said now America knows I’m not stuck in the 50s I’m just stuck in the 90s.” \nHe then read some mean tweets about himself and his use of AOL. One was: “This is Mike Pence, former governor of Indiana, Vice President of the United States, Chili’s patron, AOL user.” \nOn the press: “It’s really good to be with all of you. I really, seriously, I really respect the way you do your job — so does the president.” \nHe said the media knows what the real stories are, like when his family moved to Washington, D.C. and the press kept reporting on his rabbit, Marlon Bundo. \n“Marlon’s become kind of a big deal. He got himself an Instagram account. #BOTUS.” \nVP then made a joke about the bunny liking FOX and it being a long time before he will go on BNN and Jake Hopper not being happy about it. \nOn Paul Ryan: “Paul has his P90X, 90 minutes of aerobic workout that stresses every muscle in the body every day. And I do jazzercise at the Y.” \nJoking about their matching Tuesday ties, “At least I didn’t go with my back-up out – an all-white pantsuit. That would have been awkward.” \nTo Nancy Pelosi, who was in the room, he said, “The president and I hope you don’t change. Seriously, we’re counting on it.” \nPence said he was “offended” that so many of his former colleagues rushed for the exits on Tuesday night after the president’s speech, but he understood why. “They were racing out because they didn’t want to miss some must-see TV. The dynamic message of a rising star. The future of the Democratic Party. Kentucky’s own former governor, Steve Beshear.” \nHe said Beshear’s remarks really were “inspiring” — especially the part when he claimed to be a Democrat, and proud republican, and mostly American. [ Pence just made clear that Trump’s media cease-fire was a one-night-only thing ] \n“Humor is a great unifier, and this light-hearted tradition is a welcome respite…and be assured while we will have our differences, and I promise the members of the Fourth Estate that you’ll almost always know when we have them, President Trump and I support the freedom of the press enshrined in the First Amendment. \n“I’ve been an advocate of the free and independent press for a long time. I worked as a commentator on the radio back in the 1990s, a kind of Rush Limbaugh on decaf.” \nHe said he was “proud” to offer the federal media shield statute that passed the House of Representatives when he was a congressman. (His next line was inaudible for pooler due to clapping.) \nReferencing [Thomas] Jefferson, he said, “Given a choice between government without a free press or a free press without a government, I should choose the latter.” \nHe also brought up the quote chiseled into the wall of the Chicago Tribune about the press being a check upon the government that no Constitution has ever been able to provide. \n“True words indeed,” he said. “But these days, and I say this with the deepest respect, it seems like in the, in seems like in this short news cycle in which we live that too often stories will make page one and drive news with, with just too little respect to the people who are affected or involved. So let me just say to you as, not as your vice president, but just as a neighbor and as a champion of the [inaudible] that I think, I think we’ve all just gotta do better. And the way I think we can do better is by focusing on what unites as more often as Americans. Our commitment to truth… You know we saw the unity around our highest ideals and higher belief on Tuesday night. It was a special night. And a courageous woman and her heroic husband brought a divided nation together as the president paid tribute to Navy Seal Ryan Owens, who lost his live in the line of duty… \n“When Carryn stood up…all of our divisions melted away. In that moment, there were no Republicans there were no Democrats on that floor, there were just Americans. And not just in the Congress” but “all across the country. So in these divided times, I think we oughta try and do as much as we can. Actions, words and deeds that emulate Carryn and her courageous family. Take every opportunity that we have to stand up, to stand together. And take every opportunity to look up a little bit more, with grateful hearts for the privilege of servicing and live in the great nation in the history of the world. \n“If we do that I believe with all of my heart, by God’s grace, these divided times will give way to unity, and freedom, and America will be great again.” \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:03:31.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
