It’s pretty hard to argue otherwise. The Atlanta Falcons led the New England Patriots by a whopping 28-3 margin halfway through the third quarter, and by a comfortable 28-12 cushion with nine minutes to go. Betting markets gave the Patriots just a 4% chance of victory; quantitative forecasting models placed their odds south of 1% , based on the historical record of zero wins and 190 losses by teams in a similar position since 2001.\nBut Tom Brady , the quarterback already considered by many to be the GOAT (that’s Greatest Of All Time , for the unacquainted), pretty much cemented his claim to the throne by spearheading a comeback so improbable it seemed to bolster the theory that we must all be living in some sort of simulation . It only a took a forced fumble , a diving grab an inch off the ground of a deflected pass , and a pair of two-point conversions —all within the final nine minutes of regulation time—to send the contest to overtime for the first time ever in a Super Bowl. And on the first possession of the extra period, Mr Brady methodically led his troops 75 yards downfield for a touchdown, securing his record-breaking fifth championship ring as a quarterback.\nThere’s no doubting Mr Brady’s unparalleled brilliance—his 466 passing yards were a Super Bowl record—or the magnitude of his crowning accomplishment. But if you’re a long-suffering fan of the Falcons, who have never won a title in 51 seasons, it’s not just sour grapes to say your boys were cheated. By definition, the game was tied at the start of overtime. The Patriots got the ball first because they won a coin toss. Mr Brady worked his magic and scored. And…that was it. Seemingly more concerned about limiting the length of games than about maintaining the integrity of their sport, the lords of American football have decreed that if the team that is randomly assigned the first possession in overtime happens to score a touchdown, the game ends right then and there, without their opponents getting any opportunity to match it. Only if they either fail to score entirely or settle for a mere field goal do their rivals get a chance to tie or win.\nThis policy may seem downright progressive when compared with the NFL′s old system of pure sudden death —in which the first score of any kind resulted in victory, making whoever claimed the coin toss overwhelmingly likely to win. However, it looks retrograde in comparison with the rules used in college, which ensure a “right of reply” following any first-possession score. The NFL′s current approach still leaves the flip—which ideally should have no impact on the outcome—as a highly consequential factor. And never is it more significant than if at least one of the teams is far better on offence than defence, and therefore unusually likely to score a touchdown that cannot be answered if they have the fortune to get the ball first. That description just so happens to be a perfect fit for the 2016 Atlanta Falcons, who reached the end zone on a league-leading one-third of their drives (the overall average is 21%), but whose defence was merely middling. It was only a matter of time before the cruel arbitrariness of the NFL’s overtime rule would be highlighted on the sport’s grandest stage. But it’s hard to imagine a more brutal outcome for the unlucky toss-loser than this one. Why bother to play the games at all, if they’re going to be decided by a coin flip anyway? We could just make the Super Bowl a coin-tossing contest, and save ourselves the wardrobe malfunctions .\nOnce the Patriots had clawed back from a seemingly insurmountable 25-point deficit, their eventual triumph in overtime might have appeared predestined. But there’s no way to know for sure what would have happened had the Falcons been granted a well-deserved possession of their own, or if it had been Atlanta that had the good fortune to win the toss. The next-best thing is to figure out roughly what their chances might have been—and thus how often the 2016 Vince Lombardi Trophy would have wound up in Atlanta under a fairer overtime system. With the help of a computer and a hypothetical alternative rule book, we can reach a disheartening answer. Winning the coin toss did indeed provide an astonishingly large boost to the Patriots′ chances, and the Falcons′ chances were very much alive when the game was declared over.\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood \nThere’s no universally agreed-upon best system for overtime in gridiron football, but two options should leap to mind. One straightforward choice would simply be to play an additional 15-minute quarter. Under that scenario, since the Patriots took four minutes to complete their successful drive, Atlanta would be in the same position as a team in a regular-season game receiving a kickoff and trailing by seven points with 11 minutes left in regulation. During the past three years, excluding regular-season contests that ended in a tie, there have been 124 games in which a team trailed by six to eight points with eight to 14 minutes remaining in the game and had a first down in their own half of the field. In 18 of them, or 15%, they wound up coming back to win.\nThe drawback to this approach is that it lacks the guaranteed suspense of sudden death. An alternative that preserves it is the college football method , which proceeds in periods of one possession per side. The game ends whenever one team has scored more points on its possession than the other did on theirs in the same period. To keep game times in check, the college rules also require that teams attempt two-point conversions after touchdowns if the game is still tied after two overtime periods. (Because the success rate on such plays is far lower than on a standard extra-point kick, this clause makes it far more likely that one team will convert while the other does not, ending the game.) In our parallel, counterfactual universe, let’s use the college system as a base, but allow teams to trade field position normally (as is currently the case in the NFL) rather than having each possession start on the 25-yard line. How often would the Falcons have come back to win under this system?\nThe first step towards an answer is figuring out just how good the Patriots and Falcons actually are at football. Given the brevity of the 16-game NFL season, wins and losses can be very poor indicators of team quality. Point differential is far more reliable, but still subject to fluctuation: a team whose big plays all happen to occur deep in its own territory will be outscored by a weaker offence that just happens to get hot in the red zone , even if that difference is mainly caused by bad luck.\nIn contrast, the sturdiest estimates are those based on the largest amount of data: plays. The average NFL team participates in around 2,000 plays per season. So our starting point will be the yards per play that each club’s offence advanced, and the yards per play that its defence allowed. The gap between a team’s per-play yardage achieved and conceded predicts its future scoring margin far better than scoring margin itself does. And on this basis, it is Atlanta, not New England, that looks like the stronger side. Counting the playoffs, the Falcons progressed 6.87 yards for every play they ran, while limiting their opponents to 5.70, a differential of 1.17. In contrast, the Patriots’ figures were 5.92, 5.25 and 0.67.\nPartisans of traditional, grinding football might cry foul at this metric. Teams with powerful running backs are often well-advised to march down the field incrementally, keeping the ball out of their opponents’ hands for as long as possible as they secure one first down after another. Raw yards per play will unfairly cast such clubs in an unflattering light. But this short-yardage game can be measured as well, by the share of third downs (as well as non-kicking fourth downs) with two or fewer yards to go in which a team secures a fresh first-and-ten. Here, the Patriots had an edge. They converted 67% of these opportunities while limiting their opponents to 55%, a gap of 12 percentage points, just ahead of Atlanta’s nine-point differential.\nOf course, there is more to football than big plays and third-and-ones. For the sake of completeness, I also projected each side’s turnover ratio, expected net yardage gain on punts, average kickoff return, two-point conversion rate and field-goal success rate, and factored in the strength of the opponents they faced in all of the preceding calculations. However, in the case of hypothetical Super Bowl LI overtime possessions, none of these factors wound up significantly affecting the forecasts.\nThe other variable that did make a big difference on possession outcomes was game circumstances. Any fan would recognise that a weak offence facing a strong defence, but with the advantage of starting its drive at the opposing one-yard line, has a better chance to score than does a powerhouse offence against a porous defence with the disadvantage of starting at its own one-yard line. The score of the game can also affect strategy, particularly as the clock winds down: a club trailing by more than three points will never kick a field goal on what it expects to be its final possession.\nFiguring out precisely how each of these factors impacts what happens on the field, and how they interact with each other, is far beyond the capacity of any individual. Fortunately, for computers, it is a cinch. Using three years of play-by-play data downloaded from NFL Savant , I used a modelling technique designed for making predictions based on numerous variables to derive an equation that forecasts the result of any possession in the NFL. Its results are summarised in the table below, using the four most important variables: quality of offence and defence (measured using projected yards per play, first-down conversion rate, and turnover rate), field position and whether the offence can settle for a field goal or requires a touchdown.\nThe figures above are sorted by the expected impact of a possession on the game′s scoring margin for the team with the ball. Let′s start near the top. Leaving aside desperation situations late in the game, in an ideal situation for the club looking to score—the dataset′s best offence against its worst defence, starting a drive on the opposing ten-yard line—the possession will end with a touchdown 80 times out of 100. In 18 more, the team will successfully kick a field goal. Only 2% of the time will they fail to score at all. The average result of such a possession—80% of a seven-point touchdown, plus 18% of a three-point field goal, plus 2% of a scoreless handover—is 6.14 points. If we keep the ball at the defence′s ten-yard line, but switch the team quality so we have a poor offence facing an elite defence, the scoring expectation falls to 36 touchdowns and 35 field goals out of every 100 possessions, or 3.57 points.\nNeedless to say, the picture looks much different at the other end of the field. The absolute best offence against the absolute worst defence, starting on its own ten-yard line, will only score about half the time (39 touchdowns and 12 field goals) in a typical situation, a ratio worth 3.10 expected points. That is even fewer than the 3.57 points we would foresee from the worst offence against the best defence, 80 yards downfield. (The next time someone tells you that “football is a game of field position”, please listen to them .) And in the nightmare scenario of a bad offence facing the tough defence on its own ten, the figure are predictably grim: 7% touchdowns, 6% field goals, 87% zilch, 0.67 expected points.\nDepending on game situations, of course, these figures can change drastically. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and teams that absolutely need a touchdown and not a field goal—those trailing by four to eight points with less than two minutes left, or 12 to 16 with less than five minutes left—behave accordingly. Their field-goal rates do indeed fall to zero, and touchdown percentages generally rise in tandem. But all those Hail Marys come at a cost: they often wind up in enemy hands. Starting from its own ten in touchdown-or-bust circumstances, even the best offence against the worst defence will turn the ball over 30% of the time, nearly as often as the 35% rate that it reaches the end zone. And the worst offence against the best defence, trailing late from its own ten? Look at your peril, all ye who enter here. Such clubs commit turnovers on over half of their possessions. Moreover, the rate at which they do secure the coveted touchdown—5%—is scarcely higher than the 4% frequency with which they are tackled in their own end zone for a rare safety , handing two more points to their opponents.\nWith these percentages to hand, the contours of the Super Bowl overtime possessions that never happened between the Falcons and the Patriots can begin to take shape. Faced with the 2016 New England defence and starting a long drive on its own ten-yard line, the 2016 Atlanta offence would be expected to score a touchdown 24% of the time, successfully kick a field goal 11% of the time and turn the ball over 12% of the time. The remainder consists of punts, failed fourth-down conversions and missed field goals. At the 50-yard line, the touchdown and field-goal probabilities go up to 42% and 25%, while turnovers drop to 8%. And a mere ten yards from the promised land, the figures are 74%, 22%, and 2%. The Patriots’ numbers are a bit worse in every scenario: 20% touchdowns, 11% field goals, and 11% turnovers from their own ten; 34% touchdowns, 28% field goals, and 8% turnovers at the 50; and 63% touchdowns, 30% field goals, and 3% turnovers at the Atlanta ten.\nThese numbers suggest that, contrary to the Las Vegas bookmakers who priced the Patriots as a three-point pre-game favourite, the Falcons were the slightly stronger team. That assumption should be taken with caution, as it is based on just a small handful of readily available statistics. It′s far more likely that the bookies—as well as more detailed quantitative metrics like Football Outsiders′ DVOA —knew something that this relatively limited model does not. Nonetheless, that call would have looked prescient for the first 58 minutes or so of the Super Bowl.\nThat was the game that wasn′t \nArmed with these ratios for every potential situation, we can now simulate the “missing” possessions from the Super Bowl as many times as we would like. For each possession in each simulation, we pick a random outcome using the frequencies produced by the model. Its result, in turn, determines the probabilities for the next play in the sequence. Each one of these simulations represents one specific potential path the game would have taken. 10,000 of them should give us a pretty clear indication of how things were likely to shake out.\nThe results are displayed in the chart on the right. Even against the formidable Patriots’ defence, when a team needs a touchdown to stay alive, there’s no one better than the Falcons. On their first possession following the New England score (assuming the Patriots kicked a standard successful extra point), Atlanta tied the game with a touchdown of their own in 4,249 of the 10,000 simulations, or 42%. Those 4,249 simulations then proceeded to another pair of possessions. In the second overtime period, the Falcons won 32% of the time, the Patriots 26%, and they remained even in 42%. In turn, the 1,795 tied simulations advanced to a third round, where New England won 628 times and Atlanta 583. (Demonstrating the effectiveness of the mandatory two-point conversion rule at shortening games, 129 of these cases would have remained tied had both sides been allowed to kick extra points). It took five more rounds for the final 584 simulations to wrap up. When all was said and done, after starting off with its real-life touchdown, New England had won 77.8% of the time, and Atlanta 22.2%.\nThere′s a chance this estimate may be a bit generous, given that the Patriots were generally regarded as a slightly superior team overall. If we give Atlanta′s scoring probabilities to the Patriots and vice versa starting at the second round of possessions, reflecting this consensus, the Falcons′ chances of victory fall to 18.3%. That happens to be roughly identical to the figure you would get from a simpler back-of-the-envelope approach, boosting Atlanta′s one-in-three regular-season touchdown rate to 40% because they could not settle for a field goal, and then multiplying that probability by the bookmakers′ 44% pre-game odds of a Falcons victory. Either way, “around one in five” seems like a fairly robust assessment of Atlanta′s odds. In other words, the Falcons were probably anywhere from 20 to 100 times more likely to reverse their overtime deficit had they been given the chance than the Patriots were to complete the comeback Mr Brady actually engineered in real life.\nAll 10,000 of these scenarios start where the Super Bowl ended, on James White ’s two-yard touchdown run. But if we’re really playing what-if history, it’s worth asking what might have happened had it been Atlanta that won the coin toss under the current NFL rules. Fortunately, our simulator can run 10,000 of those hypotheticals as well. The results lay bare the absurdity of the league’s current policy. In simulated overtimes that start with the ball in the hands of Matt Ryan , who won the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award this year, the Falcons go on to win 62.6% of the time—with just over half of those victories coming in the form of unanswerable “first-strike” touchdowns on the initial possession. By contrast, in those where the Patriots win the toss and all subsequent possessions are simulated, Atlanta wins only 46.2% of the time.\nThere are of course far more important things in life than sports. But to those of us who care about wins and losses—and certainly to the team owners for whom tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars can rest on the outcome—it is hard to overestimate the gravity of a 16-percentage-point swing in the probability of winning a championship, based entirely on the result of a coin flip. Mr Brady probably did deserve his Super Bowl MVP award, but a strong argument could be made instead for Matt Slater , the bit-part New England player who made the fateful decision to proclaim “heads” as the coin spun through the air.\nThe college overtime rules, or my own proposed hybrid system (in which field position is preserved between possessions), would not take coin-based randomness entirely out of the game. The college system does still give a slight edge to the team that wins the toss. These sides invariably choose to get the ball second, since that enables them to know the result of the first team’s possession, and thus whether they need a touchdown or can merely play for a field goal. One academic study found that college teams that got the ball second in overtime went on to win nearly 55% of the time; another theoretical approach put the advantage at 52% to 48%. Nonetheless, such margins pale in comparison to a sixteen-point swing in the “ best Super Bowl ever ” based on a coin toss . Under college rules, obtaining such a large advantage would require moving up the start of the Patriots′ first overtime drive from their own 25-yard line to the Atlanta 30, or switching New England′s opponent from the formidable Falcons to a league-average team like Washington or Indianapolis.\nThe Falcons have only themselves to blame for letting a mammoth 25-point lead slip, and for clutching defeat not merely from the jaws of victory, but practically from its intestines. And nothing can rob Mr Brady of his five golden rings. At the same time, the NFL will never be able to make it up to the Falcons for denying them a 20% chance at a redemption in overtime—a policy that is arguably responsible for padding Mr Brady′s impressive tally by one-fifth of a title. But perhaps Mr Ryan and friends could take some solace if they were reassured that never again would a team suffer such an unfair fate. Too much hangs on the balance for the result of an entire season to be determined by the flight of a spinning coin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:01:21.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
