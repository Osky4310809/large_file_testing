Serena, the second seed, is 35 years old and going for her 23rd Grand Slam title. Venus, the 13th seed, is 36 and going for her eighth Grand Slam singles title. \nThe pair have had a great rivalry over the years, though it was more intense more than a decade ago when both were in their primes. Serena is still going strong but Venus has been more inconsistent in recent years. The last time they played was September 2015 in the quarterfinals of the US Open, where Serena took a victory.\nThe Williams Sisters have played each other a total of 27 times, with Serena owning the head-to-head record at 16-11. But few women can rattle Serena like Venus has been able to do over the years. The last time Venus won was at the 2014 Canadian Masters, a hard court.\nSerena has won the last two meetings between the two. As a pair, they hold 13 Grand Slam doubles titles and three Olympic doubles gold medals.\nRight now, the smart money is on Serena. She is simply the most dominant player in tennis, though since she dropped to the number two ranking in the world she has looked relatively beatable. The problem is that “beatable” Serena is still Serena, and she’s more than most players in the world can handle.\nTo get here, Venus had a hard-fought three-set match against the unseeded CoCo Vandeweghe, who also happened to beat top seed Angelique Kerber and seventh seed Garbine Muguruza on her way to the semifinals. Serena took down the unseeded Mirjana Lucic-Baroni in straight sets in the semifinals to punch her ticket into the final.\nThe women’s final will be at 3 a.m. ET on Saturday, but will be played at a normal hour in Melbourne, Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T10:49:08.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
