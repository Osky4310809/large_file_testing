Are you ready for it? #staytuned #MyMasterpieceOfIntelligence #MercedesBenz \nPosted by Mercedes-Benz Malaysia on 27hb Mac 2017 \nA new tristar arrival beckons. According to the teaser video from Mercedes-Benz Malaysia’s Facebook page, something new is on the way and is set to make its local debut on April 20. \nThe headlamp design with Multibeam LEDs in the footage appears to be from the E-Class range, and with the C238 E-Class Coupe not due in Malaysia until the third quarter of this year, that brings us to the only possible candidate, the W213 E-Class sedan going the locally-assembled route. \nSince its introduction in Malaysia last June, the E-Class has been available as a fully-imported model, the current range consisting of the E 200 , E 250 and the E 300 AMG Line . No word yet on specifications, but looks like we’ll find out soon enough. The CKD E-Class will be built at the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant in Pekan, Pahang, where the W222 S400 Hybrid is also assembled. \nRead our international drive as well as the local drive reports on the W213, and take a closer look at the local spec E-Class in our walk-around video of the car.
