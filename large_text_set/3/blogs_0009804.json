In fact, it got so bad that people started calling her \"disease face\" on social media. The acne \"demolished\" her self-esteem, she says. When she was 18, she was given the opportunity to participate in the Miss Preston Beauty Pageant. Embarrassed by her skin, she declined. \nDetermined not to let acne take over her life anymore than it already had, Crawley decided to completely overhaul her diet, cutting out dairy, sugar, gluten, and meat. Now she follows a high-fat, plant-based vegan diet and says she hasn't had a breakout since. She documented her journey on Instagram and told the Daily Mail that her confidence has returned. She's even been given the opportunity to compete in the 2017 Miss Preston pageant. \n\"Winning would of course be amazing but it’s more to show myself I can do it and hopefully give other people confidence to feel good about themselves,\" she said. \"I don’t want other girls to feel the way I did — and hopefully I can show them they don’t have to.\" \nIf you think diet could be making your acne worse, it could be worth switching from skim milk to whole milk as well as minimizing the amount of sugar and simple carbs you're consuming. Stressing less will help too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:10:43.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
