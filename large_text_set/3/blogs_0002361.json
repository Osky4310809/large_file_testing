A man had made repeated phone calls to Mahesh Bhatt , asking him for a ransom. Bhatt lodged in FIR asap and the police were quick to nab the culprit – Sandeep Sahu from UP. He told the police he did this so he could repay his loan. This obviously is a scary situation for anyone and Alia spoke up on the matter with India Today. \nI think the police and my dad are brave they did not give me a chance to get worried. They just took over. The matter is sorted and solved and everybody is safe and happy. As a parent, my father has made me feel safe. With him, by my side, I had nothing to worry about. \nBrave girl! We’re glad she’s okay and her family’s safe. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T09:26:13.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
