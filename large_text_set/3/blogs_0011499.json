DIY Smartwatch Runs Windows 98 My middle school celebrated Pi Day (not yet an officially observed celebration when I was 12) by wrapping the mathematical constant around the school walls as far as it could reach.\nWe’ve come a long way from construction paper and tape: Rhett Allain, associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, made “an artistic expression of pi” using his Raspberry Pi computer.\n“I wanted to somehow create something I can display in the hallway at school to share pi with students,” he wrote on Wired . “Then they too might find themselves addicted to the awesomeness of pi.”\nRhett Allain (Wired)\nAllain’s DIY Pi Day project looks a lot like the science fair entries back at that middle school: a bunch of components hot-glue-gunned to a poster board. The placard features a 16-by-2 LCD character display (providing a real-time value of the estimate of pi) and a reset button (push to restart the random calculation).\n“Because I am a physics professor, I added three pages of info explaining pi, how to calculate pi, and all the strange places you can find pi,” Allain said. (He even provided a printable PDF .) “I also added a beeper that emits a small (and very annoying) beep every time the computer adds another point to the diagram.\n“I like the beeper because it draws attention to the poster as people pass it. I also really like the completely unnecessary LCD display because it looks cool,” he added.\nPi, of course, is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter; the irrational number cannot be written as a fraction, and its famed 3.145926535897… the figure is just an approximation.\nStill, we’ve latched onto the sum, turning March 14 (3/14 in the month/day format) into an annual occasion, celebrated with pie (duh) and 𝛑. The date also happens to mark Albert Einstein’s birthday.", "external_links": ["http://www.piday.org/", "https://www.wired.com/2017/03/lets-calculate-pi-raspberry-pi-celebrate-pi-day/", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1TlFyRizoG-UGYxb1lCNFJxR1U/view"], "published": "2017-03-14T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:03:33.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
