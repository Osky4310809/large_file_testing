That's Exactly What He's Trying to Do. \nIn the wake of the immigration restrictions, don't forget about the steady erosion of reproductive rights. Most Popular By Sady Doyle Jan 31, 2017 We're a little over a week in to the Trump administration, and we already have a fairly clear idea of how the man at the helm plans to handle his many critics: He'll just exhaust them to death. Since his inauguration, Trump's team has taken a \"shock and awe\" approach, signing executive orders as if they're going out of style. So much horrible news has come down the pike—everything from a repeal of the ACA to the full-fledged humanitarian crisis that has emerged from Trump's \"Muslim ban\"—that even keeping up with new developments, let alone forming an adequate response, can feel impossible. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In the midst of the White House press secretary defending the detention of a 5-year-old, it's hard to even remember that this administration also engages in standard Republican awfulness. This makes sense: When you're faced with something as overwhelmingly dramatic as the President's actions on immigration, it's hard to preserve the brain space necessary to remain apprised of the slower grind of misogynist politics as usual. And no one, faced with the challenge of processing 50 upsetting news stories at once, can pay the same amount of attention to every single one. \nTrump's administration is quietly sweeping through a wave of anti-choice legislation. Most Popular And yet, it's more important than ever to somehow summon the energy. Trump's administration is quietly sweeping through a wave of anti-choice legislation. All of these bills are grounded in standard GOP policy; several have been around, in one form or another, for years. Yet, in the context of the Trump administration, they've become not only more plausible but vastly more frightening. Here's a reminder of what's at stake and why it matters. HR-7 HR-7, which the House passed last Tuesday, would fulfill Trump's campaign promise to make the Hyde Amendment permanent. Hyde, a budget rider that comes up for review on a yearly basis, prohibits federal funding for abortion. In practice, this mainly means that low-income patients cannot use Medicaid to cover abortion, though other groups with government-provided healthcare (military service members, federal employees, etc.) are also blocked. Given that first-trimester abortions can cost up to $1,500 , Hyde amounts to blatant discrimination: When you have to choose between terminating a pregnancy and paying rent, no insurance coverage for abortion means no abortion, period. For decades, the Hyde Amendment received bipartisan support. Yet, in recent years, reproductive-justice activists have successfully pressured Democrats to drop Hyde. Hillary Clinton campaigned on overturning it; a future Democratic majority could block it. Thus, HR-7 has come along, just in time to un-bend that particular arc of history. Yet, as with Trump's expansion of the Global Gag Rule, HR-7 stands not just to reinstate an existing unjust policy, but to give it sharper teeth. Along with making Hyde permanent, HR-7 would also disincentivize private insurance plans from covering abortion by withholding premium insurance tax credits, thus making those plans effectively too expensive to buy, and potentially resulting in, as Destiny Lopez, co-director of anti-Hyde Amendment campaign All* Above All, told Slate, \"a total ban on abortion coverage, including for women in the private insurance market.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below HR-190 (a Federal \"Heartbeat Bill\") and HR-586 (the \"Personhood Bill\") The public outcry surrounding HR-7 has been relatively subdued, but at least there's been one. This isn't the case for several other measures. For example, on the same day Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) introduced HR-7 to the House, Representative Steve King (R-IA) introduced HR-190, the first federal abortion ban. The measure is based on Ohio's failed \"heartbeat bill,\" which banned abortion the moment a fetal heartbeat was detectable—that is to say, at six weeks, before most people know they're pregnant. Meanwhile, on January 23, Representative Jody Hice (R-GA) introduced HR-586, a so-called \"personhood\" bill \"to provide that human life shall be deemed to begin with fertilization.\" This would not only outlaw abortion, but could potentially ban some forms of contraception, such as hormonal birth control and IUDs. \nThere's a strong argument that HR-7 is getting more attention precisely because it is (to use the medical term) less totally bonkers. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below There's a strong argument that HR-7 is getting more attention precisely because it is (to use the medical term) less totally bonkers. \"Personhood\" bills are flatly unconstitutional; under Roe v. Wade , states can only restrict abortion beginning at 22 to 24 weeks, when the fetus becomes viable. Ohio's heartbeat bill drew such universal condemnation that it was vetoed by staunchly anti-choice Governor John Kasich. HR 7, which uses the \"respectable\" method of cutting off abortion funding rather than aiming directly for the right to choose, has a better chance of being upheld, and therefore seems like the more legitimate threat. Most Popular 20-Week Abortion Bans In Trump's letter to the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List —the one where he promised to permanently enshrine Hyde—he outlined exactly four key tenets of his \"pro-life coalition.\" First, he promised to make Hyde permanent, which HR 7 would take care of. He also promised to defund Planned Parenthood, which is currently underway. He promised to nominate anti-choice Supreme Court justices; the first will be announced today at 8 p.m. Finally, Trump promised to pass into law \"the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\" a federal 20-week ban on abortion. This is the only one of his promises he has not acted on yet. The outcome of that Ohio \"heartbeat\" bill provides some clues as to how it might come to pass. Even as the 6-week, \"heartbeat\" ban drew national media attention and social media outcry, a 20-week ban quietly passed through the Ohio legislature. Kasich is staunchly anti-choice; when he struck down the heartbeat bill, the 20-week ban was there as a back-up. It was similarly unconstitutional, and yet, when compared to the draconian \"heartbeat\" legislation that had just been struck down, it looked like \"compromise.\" Meanwhile, activists had already spent their fire fighting the heartbeat bill, and had less time and energy to do anything about the 20-week ban, which safely became law. Ohio joins 15 other states with 20-week abortion bans; meanwhile, Tennessee is currently considering one, and only Idaho, Georgia, and Arizona's 20-week bans have been successfully struck down in court. Related Story The 20-Week Abortion Ban Bind There's a lesson here: For Trump, too, this latest slate of bizarre and likely unconstitutional anti-choice legislation may simply serve to wear down the public and make a 20-week time limit seem like the best bad option. The politics of distraction are powerful—whether it's a DDoS attack, mob harassment online, or a never-ending barrage of assaults on civil rights, any system subjected to enough simultaneous attacks becomes incapable of sufficiently dealing with individual attacks. By steadily lowering the American public's expectations, Trump may also lower our guard, and persuade us to accept the \"moderate\"-looking option to stave off more totalitarian measures. Yet, in this case, the moderate measures are the most dangerous ones, precisely because they are harder to challenge and more likely to succeed. \nThe politics of distraction are powerful. Don't take all this as an assertion that we need to pit abortion access against other human rights threatened by the Trump administration. If intersectional feminist theory has taught us anything, it's that these things are always connected. In fact, the Trump administration's assault on reproductive rights is key to its other goals. Sending Kellyanne Conway and Mike Pence to the largely Christian March for Life is deeply entwined with, say, banning Muslims and discriminating in favor of Christian refugees—both are statements about who counts as American in Trump's America. Look at what Milo Yiannopoulos put in his Breitbart screed against birth control: \"You may be asking what I would have women replace the Pill with, since it's obviously so awful. Condoms? Vasectomies? The answer is: nothing. We need the kids if we're to breed enough to keep the Muslim invaders at bay.\" Steve Bannon, the man who published that article, was also key to crafting Trump's Muslim ban. Again, many of the specific anti-choice measures proposed in Trump's America are not new, and do not deviate from standard Republican policy. Ohio has been trying to pass a heartbeat bill since 2011; Hyde is 40 years old. Yet, in Trump's administration, standard Republican misogyny could potentially lay the foundation for even more frightening measures. Standing up for sexual and reproductive freedom isn't just a necessary feminist measure; it's an anti-authoritarian measure. It would be a shame if, in the rush to put out a thousand simultaneous fires, we let this one quietly smolder until it burned the whole house down.
