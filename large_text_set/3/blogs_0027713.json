And, to be honest, that seems fair; it’s hard to blame them. \nThe school district, Canada’s largest, which covers 584 schools and more than 284,000 children, sits just miles from the U.S. border and actively sent dozens of school groups to the U.S. each year, but no longer. “We just can’t have trips going across the border and a student for no legitimate reason being denied entry to the U.S. We’re obviously not going to leave that student and continue on,” Ryan Bird, a spokesman for the board, told the Associated Press. \nThe 25 trips already on the books will proceed as planned, but if any of the students are refused entry at the border, the entire group will return home, according to the Toronto Star . \n‘,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:52:40.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
