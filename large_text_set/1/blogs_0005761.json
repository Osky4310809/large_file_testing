Additionally, the carrier is no longer offering 2-year contracts for its existsting customers (it ditched contracts for new customers some time ago).

Beginning with their March 2017 bills, they will have to pay an additional $5 a month. Those same customers had their plan prices raised by $5 about a year ago.
