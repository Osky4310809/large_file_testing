I own it and it clicks great pictures, breezes through games and multitasks between a plethora of apps without breaking a sweat. The smartphone is hands-down the best purchase I have ever made and therefore, when news broke out that the brand is bringing an upgraded version of the smartphone merely 5 months after the launch of the OnePlus 3, i couldn’t be more psyched. Starting at Rs 29,999, the OnePlus 3T is a extremely compelling, as it manages to pack the best possible specifications for a price that doesn’t need you to sell a kidney. Having used its cousin for a good amount of time, I am convinced that the upgraded 3T is the best bang for your buck right now. If you happen to be in the market for a smartphone and are sold on my sales pitch, then great. But if not, then I do have some more insights on why you should buy the OnePlus 3T. Look and feel: stylish and functional \nIs the OnePlus 3T the best looking smartphone you can buy right now? Probably no, seeing how the competition has been getting creative with glass and metal builds. However, with the OnePlus 3T, the company chose functionality over creativity. The smartphone is constructed entirely out of metal which gives it a sturdy build, and I think it’s quite a sleek device too. Even if you drop the smartphone accidentally, chances are that it will survive the fall. Similarly, while the subtle curves at the back give the device more personality, they also enhance the grip while holding the phone paving way for comfortable one-handed usage. Display: bright, crisp and AMOLED \nThe OnePlus 3T ships with a 5.5-inch full HD Optic AMOLED display. However, don’t think for one second that the 1080p panel holds the OnePlus 3T back. The display is extremely sharp, has great colour reproduction and is proof that 2,560 x 1,440 resolution is really not essential for a smartphone this size as it doesn’t make any practical sense. For one, it is tough to differentiate a 1080p panel from a Quad HD one, unless you are viewing it with your nose stuck up to the display. Moreover, a QHD display makes the battery drain faster and draws more power than a 1080p one, as more pixels are required to be pushed by the CPU on the former. The only advantage a 2K display has over a 1080p one is that it’s better suited for VR applications. However, that advantage is rendered moot seeing how VR itself is in its infancy right now. Therefore, while I for one don’t hate smartphones which ship with 2K displays, the only plausible use-case for them right now is that they give their users something to brag about. Performance: a smartphone on steroids \nThe OnePlus 3T ships with a Snapdragon 821 chip, which can be seen powering the top dogs in the smartphone industry such as the Google Pixel duo. However, while Google expects you to pay a premium for the fastest processor in the market, OnePlus with its 3T doesn’t. Moreover, not only does the OnePlus 3T retail for much cheaper, it also comes with 6GB of RAM which gives it a slight edge over the Pixel duo which come with just 4GB of RAM. The OnePlus 3T therefore, is solid value for money for its asking price. Software: A colourful twist to stock Android \nEver since Xiaomi came up with the Mi 3, I have been a big fan of the flagship-killer segment. Prior to the OnePlus 3, I used the Mi 3 as well as the Mi 4 intensively, and one of the biggest reasons behind my switch to OnePlus was the software. While both the Mi 3 and the Mi 4 were good devices, MIUI wasn’t really my cup of tea personally. The Oxygen OS on the OnePlus 3T is not only near-stock, but it also comes with several customisation options like MIUI, giving users the best of both worlds. You can change the smartphone’s theme, switch between various accent colours and rearrange the status bar as you see fit. There are options to switch between on-screen and capacitive navigation buttons along with support for various gestures such as drawing an ‘O’ to open the camera or a ‘V’ to toggle the flashlight when the screen is locked. Moreover, OnePlus periodically pushes out updates to keep the 3T running smoothly without any hiccups. Battery: Dash charging for the win \nThe OnePlus 3T comes with a 3,400mAh battery which should see you through the day if you are a moderate user. However, the star of the show is the smartphone’s take on fast charging dubbed Dash charging. You can find thousands of posts and videos online showcasing just how fast the OnePlus 3/3T can be charged, but you’ll still be shocked when you experience it yourself. I no longer have to sleep with my phone connected to a power outlet and can use my smartphone untethered in bed. I just charge it in the morning before I leave for work, as it charges really quickly. Even if you are an avid user and run out of charge in the middle of the day, you can plug in the OnePlus 3T for just 15-20 minutes and bring the smartphone to 30-40 percent battery levels. Therefore, while the smartphone won’t wow you with its battery life, its recharging capabilities surely will. Cameras \nThe OnePlus 3T comes with an improved 16MP front facing camera over the OnePlus 3 and if you’re into clicking selfies, then you are in for a treat. The selfies captured are with the 3T ended up with less noise, more detail and natural colours compared to its predecessor. The rear-facing sensor has been kept the same at 16MP, which clicks decent pictures provided the environment is well lit. A flagship killer, again \nThe OnePlus 3T has enough horsepower to replace your car’s engine and retails for a fraction of the cost of other premium flagships, saving you thousands of rupees. Seeing how the smartphone is being powered by the latest processor in the market right now, it won’t need replacing for at least a couple of years to come. Given everything the phone brings to the table and factoring in its sticker price, I think it makes a lot of sense to consider it over other premium flagships. Not only do you get to save money, you don’t need to make any compromises in terms of performance, build quality or features.
