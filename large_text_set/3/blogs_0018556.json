As a precursor to some heavyweight strutting along the laser-serenaded runway, a video with keywords to the tune of \"woman\", \"sexy\" and \"confident\" appears like a psychedelic chant on a life-size screen, every year. The video routine was given a miss this year at Amazon Indian Fashion Week. Instead, Alia Bhatt rose to the occasion, as the flag bearer of fierceness for designer Namrata Joshipura's showing. A choice so very apt, considering the millennial actress always managed to resonate with urban-girl- sentiment (also because she happens to be the face of the beauty brand). The actress stepped out, amidst blinding laser lights, in a sequinned green jumpsuit, with a fringed bodice. Sleek pulled-back hair, dramatic eyes and nude lip in place, Ms. Bhatt was out to hit glam town. \nThe collection stuck, and rightfully so, to the Joshipura vibe - glamorous but with restraint. Jumpsuits, trench coats and bodysuits, predominantly in denim and shiny lurex, were sent out as signature silhouettes, served with a generous side of athleisure in the name of metallic bombers and sequinned track pants. Shimmering body-hugging gowns in all avatars — slips, off-the-shoulder and its now-trending cousin, the one-shoulder — closed down the feel good presentation, almost like the fabulous intent that most beauty brands have hard-wired women to expect out of their lives. With Alia Bhatt in tow, we admit we did get a tad starry-eyed thanks to Joshipura's perennial magic.
