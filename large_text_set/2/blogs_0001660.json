We didn’t really need more reasons to fall in love with Katy Perry , but you have to admit…this is a darn good one. And it’s definitely the most epic display of friendship that we’ve ever witnessed.\nIt was either flying this over the CAA building for 15 minutes or a gift certificate to a spa Happy Birthday @mkives You know you're my favorite, I just wanted credit for this idea. \nA photo posted by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 1, 2017 at 6:19pm PST \nThis is a thousand times better than a gift certificate to the spa (see her caption), and we have no doubt that it made Michael’s day, and the day of all his colleagues at CAA. And ours, too. And yours.\nvia GIPHY It’s becoming obvious that Perry is the gift that keeps on giving; from her post-election tweets that are still so significant and inspiring for women, to her support of ladies everywhere, she’s always thinking of other people and how to make a positive impact.\nITALY WE'RE BACK! (HELLO MILANO) Spent two days in Florence scarfing down your & dweebing out in front of ur Was one of the most magical places we've ever been & now takes a spot in my top 5 fav places ever! BRAVO for preserving yourself so finely & not letting corporate companies bulldoze your historical streets \nA photo posted by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Feb 21, 2015 at 7:14am PST \nShe also encourages us to just be…ourselves. 2017 resolution: to embody authenticity!\n— KATY PERRY (@katyperry) January 1, 2017 We hope that Michael had a great birthday! We’d be lying if we didn’t feel the pressure to do something incredibly grand for our friends’ birthdays now….but let’s be real — they’ll probs have to settle for a card (and maybe a funny text). But it’s the spirit that counts, right??\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:23:48.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
