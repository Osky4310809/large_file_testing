Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe moment the accountant who tweeted and mixed up the envelopes ahead of Sunday's almighty Oscars blunder was captured on camera. \nIn pictures that have just come to light, PriceWaterhouse Coopers employee Brian Cullinan can be seen on his phone just after Emma Stone was awarded the gong for Best Actress for her role in La La Land. \nThe newly uncovered photographs not only show Cullinan engaged on his phone shortly before the “La La Land” miscommunication, he’s also photographed mixing two red envelopes backstage alongside Beatty and best actor winner Casey Affleck, who had just exited the stage. \nThis would dispute PWC’s official explanation that Cullinan grabbed the wrong envelope from a \"backup pile\" and shows he was likely always in possession of both the best actress envelope (which was given to presenter Warren Beatty) and the best picture envelope, the night’s two final awards. Brian Cullinan was pictured on his phone (Photo: Rex Features) \nA spokesman from PricewaterhouseCoopers was not available for comment. \nCullinan can be seen on his mobile phone at 9:04 p.m. PST, according to the metadata on the photographer’s camera (his Emma Stone tweet was posted at 9:05 p.m. and later deleted). \nMeanwhile Beatty and Dunaway had taken the stage at 9:03 p.m., putting the PWC executive on social media at the start of Beatty and Dunaway’s presentation. He was reportedly told not to tweet during the show (Photo: Rex Features) Brian Cullinan and Ben Affleck backstage (Photo: Rex Features) \n“He feels very, very terrible and horrible. He is very upset about this mistake,” PWC chairman Tim Ryan told Variety on Monday. \n“While I am concerned I hope we will be judged on how quickly we reacted and owned up to the issue.” \nThe Academy has since apologised to the La La Land and Moonlight filmmakers, as well as Beatty and Dunaway, and continues to investigate the matter. Chaos ensued after Brian handed over the wrong envelope (Photo: Reuters) \nOn Wednesday, Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs confirmed the pair will not be in charge of it when the 90th Academy Awards take place next year. \nIsaacs also refused to confirm or deny if the Academy would continue using PricewaterhouseCoopers - who have worked alongside the Academy for over 80 years - and said their working relationship was under review.

You have these two groups of people who came together for a second. \n\"There's a picture with me hugging Jordan [Horowitz, a producer of La La Land], and Adele [Romanski, producer of 'Moonlight'] has her arm on his shoulder.
