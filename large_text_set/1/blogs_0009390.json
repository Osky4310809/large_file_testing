So, the idea of saying it has to be amended is not necessary. I will personally lead a spiritual jihad against the Senate if they alter the inheritance law. Somebody has just said there is bound to be a bill to be passed in the Senate about inheritance. The bill about inheritance has been passed over 1500 years ago by the Almighty God in the Quran and who can alter it? \n“We have Sharia where issues of inheritance have been decided. In Auchi, we have a committee that deals with the sharing of inheritance in a way that ensures justice, because it is taken from the Quran and not the Hadith that specifies how inheritance should be shared and we have had peace in our community. If anything, I believe, sincerely, it is a joke. If it is not, I will lead a jihad spiritually against the Senate if members should alter the inheritance law of the Quran. A lot of us have free volition to do what we like but such volition is limited in the sense that human brain cannot access as explained by Almighty God.” Ikenna", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:08:19.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
