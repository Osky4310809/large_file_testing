Washington News4 \nThe repulsive note read, \nGreat service, don’t tip black people. \nIn other words, the couple paid for their meal with the nearly exact change needed and proceeded to praise Carter’s “great service” while explaining why she didn’t get a tip: She’s black, and they “don’t tip black people.” Twitter \nKelly Carter spoke to Washington’s News4, saying , \nI looked at the receipt three times is what I did. Because I was shocked. Because I’ve never, never being a server seen that. \nReporters also spoke to Carter’s manager Tom Tellez who admitted to being absolutely “appalled” by the racist note. However, Tellez said the note is “kind of in line with the political landscape.” \nI won’t put words into Tellez’s mouth, but I think what he’s trying to say is the racist note addressed to one of his servers for her “great service” is unsurprising because of the current state of American politics. \nPerhaps. \nThough, the fact human beings can be that stupid will always be shocking. I mean, some of us practically don’t have brains… \nWhat isn’t surprising about that?! \nLuckily, Carter received a tremendous amount of support when regular customers shared a photo of the racist note on Facebook where it went viral. \nSince then, customers have stopped by Anita’s to show their support for Carter. \nAs for the note and how it might have affected the server, she says , \nHe didn’t hurt me. He only hurt himself. He only makes us stronger. \nShe also stated she wouldn’t hesitate to serve the couple again if they were to dine at the restaurant in the future. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
