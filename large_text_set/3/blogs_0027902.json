There, among other necessary inquiries of information (like my address, full name, date of birth), was a question about my relationship status... Single / Married / Divorced. Without giving it much thought then, I check on the box against 'divorced.' At the interview, I was required to bring the heaps of paperwork, which included my divorce papers. During the gruelling four hours or so that I spent in the cramped quarters of the passport office, I realised how unnecessary and intrusive it is to force one to declare their failed marriage. The thought that doing so only becomes fodder for judgement, to people who do not even know you, struck me when the photocopier took a long hard look at my divorce decree and, with a smirk on his face, said, \" yeh bhi karna hai \"? No, motherfucker. I am just boasting about my wounded past. Think about it. What are the legal implications of being divorced, outside of alimony, and child support? None. There is no law that prohibits me from travelling, or taking a loan, or renting a house because I am divorced. Then, why is it that every time I take a step toward maintaining some sense of normalcy in my life, I have to be forcefully reminded of a painful phase of my life? The last time I travelled abroad was with my ex-husband, four years ago. This year, I am financially and emotionally in a place to travel again (something that is a source of excitement and joy for me), and so I decided to get a new passport so I can finally take that much awaited trip to Bali. But, every officer at the passport office successfully reminded me of why I hadn't been able to get out of the country for so long. Thank you, fucked up legal forms and systems. Now, if you are wondering how declaring that you are divorced is any different from declaring that you are married, let me tell you why. Because there are legal implications of being married. Whether you are travelling, filling an insurance form, or taking a loan, having a spouse matters. But, having an ex-spouse does not. In fact, the label 'divorced' does not have any bearings, except inviting uncalled for judgement and presumptions. Don't get me wrong. I have also been guilty of assuming that if someone is divorced, there must be something deeply flawed with them. But, I have learnt that sometimes life happens, and failed marriages do not define someone. What the disapproving eye rolls, smirks, sideway glances, and clicks of tongues of strangers, and loved ones alike do, however, is serve as a brutal reminder of the hurt, anger, fears, and struggles that you went through as one half of a failing marriage. For someone who has worked hard to heal, move forward and seek happiness, such thoughtlessness can be a step back. Since that day at the passport office, I have spent a lot of time thinking about what this label of 'divorced' means to me, and I have concluded this: It means nothing. It means that I was in a relationship that did not work. Just like the one with the guy I was seeing for two years before I met my husband. After I broke up with him, I was single, not \"broken up.\" Why should it be any different if my marriage, which is a romantic relationship at the end of the day, ends? Why should I have to live with a new label, when all I am is SINGLE?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:18:09.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
