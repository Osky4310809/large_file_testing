And I bought it and paid for the guy to drive it down here and that’s how we began,” Mochkin says inside his new cafe, which will open for business on Monday. \nThe focus at the new 25-seat eatery will definitely be coffee — single-origin, all kosher and fully caffeinated (or, put plainly: “death before decaf,” Mochkin says) — but will also have snacks like pastries, grilled cheese and avocado toast on the menu to start. \nIn a few weeks, once a full kitchen is completed in the basement, Dean Street Cafe will also serve more hefty dishes like rice bowls, Portobello mushroom burgers and poached eggs with salmon, he said. \nThe move to food service makes sense for Mochkin, whose first job was working at a kosher pizza place run by his father on Montgomery Street and Troy Avenue for 13 years. \n“I really grew up in the back of a kitchen,” he says. \nThat pizza shop, The Kretchme, was named for a word meaning an inn, gathering place or “safe haven for peace and quiet,” he said, the sentiment of which Mochkin hopes to bring to his new cafe. \n“Coffee’s supposed to bring people together,” he said. “This place will attract people who want to sit down for a while.” \nDean Street Cafe is located at 87 Utica Ave. at the corner of Dean Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T14:36:43.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
