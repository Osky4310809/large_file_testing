The new color option is currently an O2 exclusive and starts at £19 on-contract or £139.99 to buy it outright.\nSimilarly, the larger Moto G5 Plus is also rumored to receive a blue edition soon, though this hasn’t been revealed yet.\nThe Moto G5 is the latest model in Motorola’s long-running, low-cost G series, and arrives with a 5-inch 1080p display, Snapdragon 430 chipset, and 2 GB of RAM. You’ll also find a 13 MP camera on the rear, 5 MP front-facing camera, 2,800 mAh battery and 16 GB of internal storage space — expandable via microSD card.\n\nIt’s possible that this is a timed-exclusive and that it may land elsewhere before long; I’ve reached out to Motorola to find out more and I’ll update this article if I hear back.\nYou can read our hands-on Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus review here and you can let us know in the comments what you think of the new color. I’m a big fan, but I think Huawei’s metallic P9 color variants are still my favorite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T16:52:13.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
