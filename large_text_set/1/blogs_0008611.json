While Tej Bahadur may have a point about corruption seeping into our hallowed defence establishment but he seems to be totally off the mark about the quality of food served in BSF, especially when compared to the Army. \nThe video shows Tej Bahadur with his lunch where he claims there is only turmeric (haldi) and salt in the daal. The jawan goes on to say how he has been getting the same food for the past few days and how does the country expect soldiers to guard our borders when they are given such inedible food. To be fair to BSF, when their jawans serve under the Army for a two-year period, they are provided food by the Army itself. Put your heads down in shame. Transferred And Given Plumber's Job, Pressurised To Take Down Video, Says BSF Jawan https://t.co/5D7pCthVSJ \n— Aditya Raj Kaul (@AdityaRajKaul) January 10, 2017 \nThough our paramilitary does not enjoy the benefits in the same way as the Army, yet there is only one domain where BSF scores over the Army – food. Rather than getting ration itself, BSF jawans get a monthly ration allowance of Rs 2,906 during border postings. They have a ration board which sits every month to decide what food to buy for the jawans from the allowance they get. This allowance cannot be kept individually and is transferred to the ration board. The board is constituted of an officer, subordinate officer, head constable, constable and constable sweeper or barber. Probe BSF jawan’s charges but address discipline issues too: Ex- DG Prakash Singh via @htTweets https://t.co/PoGHXxmevb \n— jatin gandhi (@jatingandhi) January 10, 2017 \nIn such a democratic setup it is tough to run roughshod over genuine concerns of junior staff. In addition, BSF gives non-vegetarian food four times a week. Some serving BSF officers have narrated stories about how their drivers would simply refuse to eat in Army canteens and preferred to wait to get back to their mess to eat. \nBSF has assured a fair and transparent probe into Tej Bahadur’s allegations but it must also heed the advice its former chief, Prakash Singh – ensuring discipline among its ranks. There are forums within BSF to air grievances and service rules prohibit sharing information, pictures, details etc. through any medium. After all as Singh says, discipline is integral to good performance. DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author's own.
