That’s cause for alarm,” he said. \nYet the mass media failed to relay the Census report findings to the American people.   \nIt’s no secret that Chicago has a problem with violent crime . The Daily Mail reported an astounding 760 homicides in 2016 alone. That number is the highest it’s been in more than 20 years. \nPresident Donald Trump has been outspoken about the crime rate in Chicago . We previously reported that President Trump warned Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel that if he did not take action to fix the city’s crime rate, the president would “send in the feds.” If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible “carnage” going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 \nOf course, the media doesn’t want to bring any attention to a problem that President Trump has promised to fix. If a report fails to fit their anti-Trump agenda, you can be sure national news networks will ignore it. \nSince Trump brought awareness to the high crime rate in Chicago, and the Census report proves the president is right, it seems the mass media finds it irrelevant to report.
