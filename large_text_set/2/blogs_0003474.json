Two of its leading lights met today in Downing Street, as Theresa May greeted Benjamin Netanyahu for a round of talks , before the Israeli prime minister flies to Washington to meet the man himself. If May had invited Vladimir Putin to join them, they’d nearly have had the club’s full membership. \nOf course, May and Netanyahu approach the US president from very different directions. For the Israeli PM, as for Putin , Trump was his genuine preference in November’s election. He liked Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran, which has long been – and continues to be – Netanyahu’s top strategic priority , if not his personal obsession. He also reckoned Trump would be more indulgent than Hillary Clinton might have been of Israel’s continued settlement activity in the occupied West Bank. \nAfter eight years of making no secret of his disdain for Barack Obama, the last thing Bibi wanted was another four-year helping from Obama’s former secretary of state. And so Netanyahu took his place alongside the Russian president as one of the very few world leaders who punched the air when Trump won. May to meet Netanyahu ahead of Brexit debate in Commons – live updates Read more \nFor May, the relationship is rather different. She has been thrown together with Trump not by choice but by necessity. She is embracing Trump to keep warm in the chilly, post-Brexit landscape. Having turned her back on Britain’s nearest neighbours in Europe, she knows she has to make it work with the US, even if it is under new, mercurial management . She might have preferred dealing with a President Clinton – though not if Hillary had honoured Obama’s threat to put Britain at the “back of the queue” for a new trade deal – but that’s not what she got. The US electorate handed her a big (orange-tinged) lemon, now she has to make lemonade . \nAs a result, May and Netanyahu went into this meeting looking for different things, seeking from each other the very things they need from Trump. For May, the priority was, inevitably, trade – hoping to get the Israelis to commit, at least in principle, to even closer economic ties between the two countries once Britain slams the door on the EU (as it happens, British-Israeli trade is already pretty strong). Netanyahu urges May to support new sanctions against Iran – video \nFor Netanyahu, the focus was, once again, Iran. He wants to recruit Britain into a “common front” against Tehran, seeking an ally for his view that the nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration is fatally flawed, that it will facilitate, not prevent, the Iranians from acquiring the bomb. He will doubtless have pointed to Tehran’s test-firing of a ballistic missile as proof that the Iranians are acting in bad faith – and that the nuclear threat has not receded. \nBoth sides will surely have promised to do all they can to help, though that will have been easier for Netanyahu than May. He can make nice noises about trade, but she can hardly abandon the Iranian deal, given that Britain was deeply involved in that process from the start. Indeed, May’s spokeswoman reiterated the British view that the agreement has “neutralised” the possibility of Iranian nukes for more than a decade. \nBut hovering over today’s meeting will surely have been the thought that Trump might end up disappointing both of them. It’s not just that the US president has shown himself to be volatile and unpredictable, ready to slam even longstanding allies (as the prime minister of Australia can testify). He can also backtrack on previous commitments without a blush. Witness last week’s signals from the White House that, though it’s happy to impose sanctions on a few more individual Iranians, it is not, after all, preparing to scrap the nuclear accord. Netanyahu’s visit comes amid tensions between UK and EU over Israel Read more \nAnd if Netanyahu was expecting an entirely free hand from Trump when it comes to the Palestinians, he will have been disappointed on that score too. Last week, the White House warned that expanded settlement activity “may not be helpful in achieving” peace. That will strike Palestinians as a feeble, if not grotesque, understatement. But, together with indications that Trump is in no hurry to fulfil his campaign pledge to shift the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, it will have dampened Netanyahu’s confidence that Trump was about to make all his dreams come true. \nMay has less immediate cause to worry, only the safe assumption that when Trump promises a deal he means one that favours him and screws you. But she has already seen that friendship with Trump can be costly. Not only is she the target of domestic fury over her state visit invitation to the new president, but her eagerness to embrace Trump has surely alienated further her European counterparts, who pointedly gave her the cold shoulder at their weekend summit in Malta. Netanyahu will discover that his enthusiasm for Trump has cost him too – angering many in the US Jewish community whose support could normally be relied upon, but who are deeply wary of, if not antagonistic towards, the president. \nPerhaps May and Netanyahu bonded over all this when they met for lunch at No 10, consoling each other that it’s not easy being a pal of Donald Trump . After all, there’s a reason their club has so few members.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:28:37.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
