More specifically, it's planned for launch in \"fall\" 2017. \n\"Destiny\" is a game about traveling the universe, meeting aliens, and then shooting them. Or in the case above, stabbing them. Bungie \nThat's according to Activision, the game's publisher, which held an investor Q&A following this week's quarterly report. Activision COO Thomas Tippl reconfirmed, \"The release of a full 'Destiny' sequel later this year, designed to thrill our existing loyal fan base, and bring many new players into the fold.\" \nThough Tippl didn't mention as much specifically, the much-anticipated sequel is anticipated to launch on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and — finally — PC. Notably, the first \"Destiny\" never arrived on PC. \nActivision \nActivision CEO Eric Hirshberg offered a few more details later in the call. \"If you're one of the millions of players who really invested in 'Destiny 1,' and put a lot of hours and passion into that game, you're gonna love this game and there's a lot more of what you love here. For anyone who either hasn't yet tried 'Destiny' or who hasn't played it in awhile, we think we've made a game with the sequel that's gonna have a lot for them to love too. The cornerstone of that is a great cinematic story, that's been a real focus, with a great cast of memorable, relatable characters, coupled with some very nice ways to make the game more accessible to casual players. Without losing anything that our core players love, we've made it more accessible to someone who just wants to have a great, more casual first-person action experience.\" \nBeyond those scant details, we also know that the folks tasked with creating \"Destiny 2\" are the same folks who crafted \"Destiny's\" critically-acclaimed \"The Taken King\" expansion. If you liked the first game's add-on content, get ready for a lot more. \"We plan to support the release of the sequel with a great content plan post-launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow,\" Tippl said. \nBoth Hirshberg and Tippl mentioned a \"big reveal\" planned for \"Destiny 2\" later this year, so stay tuned for much more info on the game in the coming months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:18:31.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
