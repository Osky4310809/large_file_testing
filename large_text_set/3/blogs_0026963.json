Gone,” he said in a statement. \n“It is a crime against people who every day face the injustices of poverty and deprivation, who often seek out a living on the streets and markets, but who depend on these vital services.” \nAlley said although the situation had eased, the city’s Boroko region had experienced “great devastation”. \n“Now that calm has been restored, we are left with this terribly empty feeling due to the totally unnecessary loss and destruction of not just buildings, but buildings that represent vital services to people who desperately need them,” he said. \nAlley described looting during the riots as “astounding”, with hundreds of people taking part in order to get their hands on free goods. \nKathy Testh, who works at the Mapang Missionary Home a few blocks away from the riots, said she woke up to the sound of gunshots. \nTesth said she drove to a meeting only to return to find the main roads cordoned off and being manned by armed guards to stop more people entering the area. \nAlley said several Salvation Army staff had taken ill after smoke inundated the buildings, located on the same street as the riots. \n“Almost the entire business block across the road has been destroyed, unnecessarily by raging fires, rampant looting and out of control crowds,” he said. \nHe said the Salvation Army was committed to supporting the community to rebuild.
