Now,Hollywood is pleading with Congress to pretty much oppose anything President-elect Donald Trump does when he becomes the 45 th president of the United States, showing once again the appalling lack of self-awareness from the Left. Actors such as Sally Field, Steve Buscemi, and Rosie Perez, along with commentator Touré, participated in this production. \n“The majority of Americans — regardless of who they voted for — did not vote for racism, sexism, xenophobia, and yet, Donald Trump won. Since he won, hate crimes are rising. Women have been attacked in his name. People of color attacked in his name,” they say. \nThey then read the text of a petition that’s featured on Moveon.org’s website: We demand that you vigorously oppose Donald J. Trump to the extent that he pursues racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, anti-worker, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-environmental policies. \nWe demand that you block nominees who threaten the rights of women, the LGBTQ community, people of color, immigrants, and the poor. \nWe need and expect you to protect our civil liberties, and to use your congressional powers to obstruct anything that violates our core values as diverse Americans. \nCongress, the Hollywood Left has your back, as long as you do what they say and oppose Trump. \nThey end this nauseating video saying, “signed the majority of the American people.” \nOh, and did we mention that there’s a lot of hoaxes regarding the spike in hate crimes? Yeah, there’s that too . \nBut again, this is unadulterated crap. Yes, it’s a tad annoying, but I’m sort of relishing the endless whining from the Left, their incapacity to come to grips that their gal got beat in November. Also, and here’s where the Hollywood Left would do well to pick up a newspaper every now and then, Congress is Republican. The House is Republican. The Senate is Republican. The 69/99 state legislatures are Republican. Twenty-five states have a unified state government that’s Republican. Two-thirds of the governorships are Republican. Three million more voters cast their ballots for House Republicans. I don’t think they’re going to listen–and they shouldn't. Of course, they should oppose legislation that's racist, sexist, etc. but that's not the point of this video. It's to stop the resurgence of a right-leaning populist wave that could wipe away Obama's legacy. It's a swipe at the right, but you already know this. \nBut hey, it makes the Left feel better. And if liberal idealists think that these snobby elitists are actually going to cobble together voters, you’re really living in an alternate reality. This isn’t the apocalypse. This isn’t the end of America. It was just an election that you lost because you seem to have forgotten that there’s an America that extends beyond the concrete jungles of urban America. Clinton sucked. That’s the first step towards recovery, but knowing liberals—they’re just content with blaming Trump’s win whatever is on the progressive Left's grievance list. \nThat’s fine. You’ll only ensure that Trump is a two-term president. If you want to increase Trump’s support, keep making embarrassing videos like this. In the meantime, Republicans will govern. \nDonald J. Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on January 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:56:46.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
