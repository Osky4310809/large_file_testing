With the OnePlus 3 now off the shelves, the brand probably has good expectations for the smartphone anyway. A phablet of this quality at this price point isn't exactly common. On the left is the OnePlus 3T in Gunmetal, and on the right, its predecessor, the OnePlus 3. / © AndroidPIT \nOnePlus 3T design and build quality \nMy colleague Omar raved about the design of the OnePlus 3 during his test of the device. I find myself in the same situation with the OnePlus 3T today, with one key difference: the OnePlus 3 was the rightful heir to the OnePlus 2, while the OnePlus 3T is just a little brother to the OnePlus 3. \nIf you liked the design of the OnePlus 3, you'll like the OnePlus 3T. The design is basically the same. OnePlus kept the aluminum unibody, the elegant curved edges, the fingerprint scanner on the front, the sound setting Hotkeys...all the things which made us fall in love with the OnePlus 3. It's not particularly helpful to review all of these features, so I will just share the ones which really make the phone's strengths stand out. The fingerprint scanner is located under the screen. / © AndroidPIT \nOnePlus knows how to make use of space on their phones. Unlike Google, which puts an empty space under the screen of its Pixel phones, OnePlus takes advantage of the space to house its fingerprint reader. Above, we find the speaker and sensors. On the right side, we find the button to turn the display off and on, and trays for two nano SIM cards. Apart from the new Gunmetal color, the 3T looks the same as a OnePlus 3. / © AndroidPIT \nIf there's one thing I find handy on an iPhone, it's the ability to switch from ringtone to silent mode with the easily distinguishable side buttons. OnePlus gave the 3T a similar setup, giving the ability to switch to silent mode without having to turn on the screen. \nAnother advantage is the USB (2.0) Type-C port found on the bottom of the device, between the speaker and the mini-jack (yes, there is a mini-jack!). Having the mini-jack port on the bottom of the device isn't necessarily bad; it just means you have to put your phone in your pocket upside down when you listen to music, so it's right-side-up and ready to use when you take it out that way. Unfortunately, the camera protrudes a little bit from the back of the phone. / © AndroidPIT \nWith regard to handling, it is a treat. Of course, you must love screens which are a little bit big, and in certain circumstances it is necessary to use two hands. This device is subjectively large, with the following dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm. That being said, it's certainly not too big, as you don't have to worry about it having difficulty sliding into your pocket. \nIf you want a phone with a premium look and feel, you will be well-served by the OnePlus 3T. The surface and build quality of the 3T is consistent with other metal body phones like the Google Pixel, giving it a truly chic appearance. Of the two colors, Soft Gold and Gunmetal, I really like the Gunmetal which recalls the lighter gray shade of the original OnePlus 3. OnePlus 3T display \nOnce again, OnePlus opted for a 5.5-inch display. This is something that was successful on its predecessor, the OnePlus 3. The screen is an Optic AMOLED, which according to OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei , is tweaked specifically for the handset, making contrast and color temperature truer to life and viewing better when outdoors. The OnePlus 3T comes with a Full-HD screen and this choice has advantages and disadvantages. One the one hand, the energy consumption is not too high, particularly with the AMOLED screen. But the downside is that the definition is not ideal for VR. You can adjust the display settings yourself. / © AndroidPIT \nThe screen is 5.5 inches, making it one of the smaller phablets. Like that of the OnePlus 3, the pixel density is 401 ppi. The screen is Full-HD (1920x1080), which at the advent of VR, is unfortunate. Some newer phones have Quad-HD (2560x1440) resolution instead. Nevertheless, the screen is quite good, the colors are vivid, and I have no problems with it. You can adjust the display settings yourself by calibrating the screen, setting the color temperature differently or by using the sRGB mode. It is pleasant to use this mode, since it makes it less tiring for the eyes, but the yellow hue may get on your nerves. \nUnfortunately, I lack the special equipment to test the screen brightness objectively, but it seems to be pretty good. White on the screen sometimes tends toward yellow or blue hues depending on the angle you hold the device. I couldn't test it in strong sunlight, since the sun isn't strong in Berlin this time of year. The 3T's night mode adapts the colors of the screen so your eyes don't get tired when reading in low light conditions. This is one of the more interesting features of the device for me. \nBy default, the Gorilla Glass 4 screen comes with a 2.5D screen protector. The protector comes pre-installed since Gorilla Glass 4 is more easily scratched than Gorilla Glass 3. OnePlus 3T software \nHere is where I was really disappointed. On the 3T we find OxygenOS 3.5.1, which is based on...Android 6.0.1! Android Nougat was officially released months ago, and new phones are already being sold running the new version of the OS, but OnePlus opted for the tried and true Marshmallow version anyway. That being said, they already announced that the 3 and 3T would be able to update to Nougat in December. No Nougat, just good old Marshmallow. Do you prefer the light or dark theme? / © AndroidPIT \nIn short, the user interface is a lot like stock Android and it isn't built upon the latest version of Android, which is a shame. That said, like with the OnePlus 3, the picture isn't totally black. Some of the the interface elements have changed, like the quick bar settings which look more like Nougat, and the more intuitive options, in addition to a weather app and voice recorder which also appeared. \nOn one hand, devotees of pure Android will find it agreeable, despite some tiny differences like smaller icons here and there. On the other hand, there is no bloatware. The software provides some useful functions, like accessibility help for the visually impaired (TalkBack, different font sizes, zoom gestures) and the App Locker function which locks certain apps with a code through the \"Never Settle\" banner on the top left of the home screen. The menu provides quick access to contacts, apps, and widgets. / © AndroidPIT \nThis mode allows you to quickly access your recent contacts, apps, and a status panel which gives you an idea of your remaining battery life, memory usage, and other widgets. Personally, I don't find this very useful, since I prefer to use Google Now to get weather and news updates, but I'm sure some will like it. \nIf you want to customize your menus, you have two options: light or dark. Plus, you can set a secondary color, like an all black menu with green text that will really stand out. More black on an AMOLED is always good for battery life. It's not necessarily useful, but some will like having the color options. OnePlus 3T performance \nBefore we get too far, let's talk about the technical specs of this device. The processor is a 2.35 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. According to Qualcomm, it's 10 percent more powerful than its predecessor, the 820 with its 2.2 GHz. To complement this, we find the improved Adreno 530 graphics chip, which also boasts at least a 5 percent performance boost and low battery consumption. Along with all of this, we find 6 GB of RAM, plus 64 GB or 128 GB of storage, the latter of which is only available in the Gunmetal color. This device does great on benchmark tests. / © AndroidPIT \nOn the 3T, we find UFS 2.0 (universal flash storage), which should allow for relatively quick loading of apps. In practice, I've found this to be true. For everyday use, the performance is good: the RAM and processor can handle multitasking and deliver a good experience consistently. I haven't encountered any crashes, slow downs, or bugs. Everything seems to be fluid. The phone seems to get warm after heavy use, but nothing abnormal. The fingerprint reader can unlock the device and take you to the home screen in 0.2 seconds. \nYou can use both nano SIM trays on the device, but OnePlus unfortunately didn't give us a MicroSD card slot. \nA feature which will please many is the dual SIM. You can use both nano SIM trays on the device, but OnePlus unfortunately didn't give us a MicroSD card slot. The North American model sports WCDMA: Bands 1/2/4/5/8, FDD-LTE: Bands 1/2/4/5/7/8/12/17/30, and CDMA EVDO: BC0. The OnePlus 3 has a relatively low SAR. \nAs far as benchmarks go, the smartphone scores well, even against the OnePlus 3 which sets the bar. You can find the results of the test in the table below. The battery life test was carried out with the screen at maximum brightness, a topic which we will return to in the section on the battery. \nBenchmarks - OnePlus 3T 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.1 3D Mark Sling Shot ES 3.0 \n3D Mark Sling Shot ES 2.0 Geekbench 4 - single core PC Mark Work Performance 2.0 PC Mark Storage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T16:52:10.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
