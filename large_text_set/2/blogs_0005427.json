GEOLUXE, stone. designed by naoto fukasawa. more than anything, the exhibition intends to showcase the fact that the two terms are not mutually exclusive. taking objects from both extremes and blurring the boundaries in between, naoto fukasawa takes a balanced look at the forms and functions that shape the definitions of both. even stone and cement walls are carefully considered, and assigned a place on the scale naoto fukasawa expands on the various themes that informed his design of the exhibition: \ntheme 1: process and material \n\nthe material is rooted in the region. from its special character and strengths (materiality) the kogei artist derives motivation to create and produce form. in all processes, from kogei to industrial manufacturing, the special character of the material is minutely refined and reflected in the making of things. common to all processes, whether kogei and industrial manufacturing, is the jig. these days, however, with the debut of digital production machines (3D printers, laser cutters, CNC milling, etc.) it has become possible to manufacture without a jig. the difference is hard to define, and indeed not always present \ntheme 2: hand and machine \n\nindustrial manufacturing (design) originally began by imitating kogei. machines, in other words, sought to imitate handiwork. this endeavor, then, was hugely successful. so much so, the layman was unable to tell the difference. and so much so, people forgot the ways to make things. often, it comes down to process, materiality, function or value \ntheme 3: form \n\nin the interval between kogei and design are ‘kogei-like design’ and ‘design-like kogei’. the begging bowl (oryoki) shows the concept of a module and is an example of ‘design-like kogei’ seeking a harmony between itself and other designs. ‘kogei-like design’, on the other hand, uses a form to manufacture a large volume at one time, and yet, finishes the process with hand-refinement and post-processing. designer yanagi sori also mass-produces kogei-like forms created by hand. through careful hand finishing, the work achieves a consummate form. their individual positionings form a commentary on the traditional history and assumed future of each piece \ntheme 4: change over the years \n\nwith time, the feel and tactile qualities of an object change, and the user living with that change develops affection for the object. time not only brings physical change to an object, it also seasons the value of its maker or brand. braun products, a synonym for design, were cold in the beginning, but today, they seem warm and awaken our affection. time, we might say, turns design into kogei.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:49:24.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
