The pair will again do battle in the Australian Open final Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images Kevin Mitchell at Melbourne Park Saturday 28 January 2017 17.18 GMT Last modified on Saturday 28 January 2017 17.21 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nI t is the debate that pollutes a thousand friendships: is Roger Federer , who has won 17 majors, entitled to be regarded as the greatest player tennis has ever seen if he has lost 23 times in 34 matches to Rafael Nadal, who has won 14 slams? At Rod Laver Arena here on Sunday , we will have more evidence to pore over when they contest the final of a grand slam tournament for the 12th time. \nThis is the final no one expected but nearly everyone wanted. A fortnight ago, nobody outside their immediate circles would have predicted that the title would be decided between the world No17 and the world No9 in a stretch of competition where Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic are so far ahead of the field that their nearest rival is Milos Raonic, the ailing Canadian who went out to Nadal in the quarter-finals. Serena Williams delivers sibling empathy to stand tall as greatest of her generation | Kevin Mitchell Read more \nNadal, who turns 31 during the French Open, and Federer, who will be 36 in August, are revisiting their rivalry partly because Denis Istomin, ranked 117 in the world, made the Spaniard’s job easier by eliminating Djokovic in the second round , then Mischa Zverev (ranked 50) shocked Murray in the fourth round on the other side of the draw. Those upstarts lost their next matches, but they had left their mark on the tournament in dramatic style. \nThe old campaigners, meanwhile, worked their way through the draw with varying degrees of sweat and panache, Nadal surviving the most searching examination in the semi-finals when he took nearly five hours to beat the superb Grigor Dimitrov on Friday night. Federer’s semi-final against Stan Wawrinka also went five sets, but lasted about two hours less and was played a day earlier. \nBoth were understandably tired by their efforts and, unusually, decided not to talk to the media on the day before the final. There was, though, one expert voice to provide perspective. \nDimitrov, so similar in style to Federer (and a client of his agency, Team8), left the tournament a revivified presence on the Tour because he pushed Nadal so hard and the result was in doubt all the way to the final point. \n“He’s such a fighter, such a competitor,” the world No 15 said. “It was an honour for me to play a match like that against him. It also shows me that I’m in a good way, I’m on the right path. One thing I can say is that I left it all out on the court. It’s been super intense. He really shows why he’s [still] Rafa.” \nThat could be a determining factor in the final because Nadal also had to give every last drop of sweat to get past him. He said he was exhausted, which was self-evident by his demeanour and his eagerness to leave the site and get some sleep. \nA lot of the elite players want no more to do with a tournament when they lose. They are just keen to get out of town and regroup. When Djokovic lost to Marin Cilic in the Paris Masters in November, he was asked if he would stay on to watch Murray as he bid to overtake him as world No1 , he replied: “I’m planning definitely to stay another few days here with accreditation and watch all of his matches, yes ... and leave my son at home.” \nDimitrov reacted differently. As disappointed as he was about falling just short, he said: “I’m going to watch it for sure. It’s super amazing. It’s great for the sport again.” Australian Open: tennis greats divided on Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal Read more \nSo it is. For all that the game could do with some of the younger players breaking through to challenge Murray and Djokovic, there is an audience out there that relishes the return of Federer and Nadal. Theirs has been the rolling war that defined the first decade of the millennium. It seemed at one point it would last until they chose it not to. \nThat was unrealistic. As great as they are, they are prisoners of time like all the others. But they have a chance here to remind us what we have been missing. \nIf the groin strain Federer picked up against Wawrinka has eased sufficiently to allow him to move like he did when destroying Tomas Berdych, he could win it in four sets; if Nadal can carry the sheer animal grit he displayed against Dimitrov over the course of five sets, he should be too strong for his old friend. I suspect the latter will be the case. Previous finals \nFrench Open, 2006, Nadal A 20-year-old Nadal became the first man to defeat Federer in a Grand Slam final.
