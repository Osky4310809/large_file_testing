I'm really expecting them to be close if not better than my Yamaha EPH-100. \n\nFinally! Here are my very first Out Of The Box impressions of Carbo Tenore: \n\nOriginally Posted by Lifted Andreas \nOk guys, here goes... First impressions on the Carbo Tenore! \n\nWOW, these things are tiny and are of awesome build quality! \n\nJust plugged them into my iPod Classic (6th Gen) + C&C BH combo (LF on) with my latest Trance mix playing, and I have to say these things sound just like I wanted them to. Wider soundstage than my Yamaha EPH-100 which are almost triple the price of the Tenores, treble is nice and pronounced but nowhere near the pain levels. Then again, everyone has different sensitivity to treble. The bass is more rounded off and just as quick as the Yams, which is again what I was hoping for. Damn, these things are engaging!! \n\nAgain, soundstage is like OMG! My head is in space kinda wide lol \nOooh, you're good - and fast! This spot is mine, all mine! (reserved for some DX210 Basso thoughts/impressions) \n\nEdit: for my impressions of the Basso's, see d mark0's thoughts here - they are spot on! I will add more impressions, but those pretty much sum it up. Edited by waynes world - 5/25/13 at 7:36pm Originally Posted by waynes world \nOooh, you're good - and fast! This spot is mine, all mine! \n\nThats just how I roll!! \n\nLet the hype train leave the station. Now we just need DannyBai and other Basso users in here lol Quote: Originally Posted by Mackem \nMy Carbo Bassos were dispatched on the 15th from Japan, so I'll be sure to give my impressions when I get them. Massive upgrade over my FX101s :) \n\nWow, awesome! I bet you're well excited. xD \n\nDid you use Amazon JP? \n\nPS. My Carbo Tenores have been dispatched Internationally today from Tenso! Edited by Lifted Andreas - 5/24/13 at 4:21am \nJust reposting my initial thoughts that was posted on the Discovery Thread... \n\nI won't cover anything else aside from the sound because I believe Ds has that covered in his previous review of the Carbo Basso. This is my impression straight out of the box and changed the tip with Meelec double flange tips (Update: 25/05/13 - D's was right; the Bassos sound better with narrow bore tips. I'm currently using the stock tips and the bass is much tighter and well defined.) . Amp: FiiO E11 (EQ: 0; Gain: low) BASS One word: WOW! This pair has the most authoritative bass I've ever heard in an IEM. Very clean, goes really deep and just right in between Punchy and Boomy bass. To me it's just perfect... I now hear a lot of micro details in the lower frequencies (details that I didn't really notice with the XBA 3). This reminds me of the FX3X bass but more refined and detailed. Listening to Megadeth's Kill the King and this can really handle with heavy metal speed. Not as fast as the XBA 3 but the timbre and decay is so much more authentic. Double bass kicks sounded so good, exactly how you hear it on a live concert! MIDS Midrange is so smooth and just about right... not as forward as the XBA 3 but (Update: 25/05/13 - After 100 hrs of break-in or maybe brain burn-in, the mids and highs are now more open and details are quite clear to me. Mids are more forward and better than the MH1c/XBA3.) is never lacking and it doesn't disappoint. It doesn't leave you wanting for more because it's there. But for those who love vocals tho, especially female vocals; this may not be the right IEM for you. Mids are not forward enough to highlight female vocals. These phones are not for those who focus on a particular component in a song: may it be guitars, drums, or vocals; this IEM is for those who listen to a song as a whole and have fun with the entire presentation. HIGHS Buttery smooth... think about MH1c with further refinement/tuning. I just love how this pair NEVER reaches sibilance. I've thrown every pitchy song in my collection and not once did this pair sounded sibilant. If you have songs by pitchy female artists such as Taylor Swift or Avril Lavigne, this IEM is the solution. I turned up the volume all the way to the top (w/o amp) and their voices didn't go overboard! I believe I can listen to the Carbo Basso all night long and I'd never feel fatigue. It doesn't have the detailed precision of the XBA 3 and CKN70, but on the other hand: it doesn't have the artificial peaky sound either. Just smooth and refined highs with enough detail to produce a fun yet non-strident music. DETAILS While midrange and treble where not spectacular (like CKN70), the details in the bass department will more than make up for it. This is not an analytical IEM and should never be evaluated as one. As a fun IEM, this delivers more than what's expected. Compared to the XBA 3, the Sony excels in the high frequencies but the DX210 owns the XBA 3 in the lower frequencies. (Update: 25/05/13 - After 100 hrs of break-in or maybe brain burn-in, the mids and highs are now more open and details are quite clear to me. Highs - tho not as good as the CKN70, it is good enough for a VERY satisfying listening session.) I'm loving the DX210... This is not a neutral/analytical IEM but a fun and well balanced BASS IEM. It will not replace my XBA 3 but it will definitely get heaps of ear-time because it's just so much fun to listen to. You can really enjoy each and every song in your playlist. That amazing bass even transforms classic acts such as England Dan and John Ford Coley and make their songs sound like they've just been recorded in the recent years. As a result, those oldies don't sound so out of place when they play right after a modern pop song. For $42, I'd say the Zero Audio Carbo Basso DX210 is worth MORE than what I paid for. My apologies for not providing more details as I am still a novice at this... but I do know when a pair of cans sounds good/bad. A big thanks to Dsnuts for this discovery, it is an awesome IEM for the price indeed!
