As the governor, the minister and other dignitaries made for the bus that was waiting, other vehicles on the convoy started to queue behind the bus, which now moved towards the gate. \nJust then, an unmarked Jeep which the two blind athletes were standing close to made to join the convoy, hitting the two blind athletes on their legs. As if that was not enough, an overzealous mobile Policeman started pushing the blind athletes to pave way for the car to pass. \nIt took the intervention of onlookers who were shouting “they are blind…they are blind,” for the Policeman to come to his senses. \nBut the blind athletes cursed and shouted back at the policeman who looked remorseful after realising they were blind. \nSpeaking to Sports Vanguard, one of the blind athletes, Samuel Ige said, “we came here to train and when we heard that the minister and the governor were here, we came to hear what they would say. I run 100 and 200 metres. We train everyday but no competition. Since 2012 there has been nothing by way of competition. We are wasting.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T05:44:56.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
