As expected, Yong Jun Hyung played a large role in the production of this album, with lyric writing credits on all five songs, and composition credits on three tracks. His credits are often listed as a member of the duo Good Life, which he has formed along with Kim Tae Joo. \nMember Yang Yoseob also took part in writing the lyrics for, composing, and arranging their song “Start” (tentative title), while Lee Gi Kwang participated in writing, composing, and arranging the song “Dangerous” (tentative title). \nAhead of the mini album’s release, Highlight will be sharing a pre-release track on March 13 at noon KST. As the song “Don’t Frown” (tentative title) is underlined and starred on the track list, this may be their pre-release track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:28:23.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
