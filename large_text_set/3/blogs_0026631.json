Well I ended up at 306. I had election night, 306 … Brexit, I predicted Brexit, you remember that, the day before the event. I said, ‘no, Brexit is going to happen,’ and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened . Many many things. They turn out to be right.

You know. Say hello to everybody OK?” \nWell, on that note… \nNeedless to say, the media went nuts over Trump’s remark. Here are some of the headlines: “What Trump’s Time Interview Shows About His Thinking” ( The New York Times ), “Donald Trump’s dizzying Time magazine interview was ‘Trumpspeak’ on display,” ( The U.K. Guardian ) and “US President appears to lie about lying” ( The U.K. Independent ).
