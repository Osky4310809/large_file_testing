He was a heck of a coach, but a better person. You guys deal with him and know how good of a guy he is. I’m glad we sent him off with a win though.” \nMany of the players knew before they took the field Sunday of Kubiak’s impending resignation after reports of the news earlier in the day . But he didn’t tell them. Kubiak wanted the focus to be on his players and the game, not himself and his future. \n“That just tells you a lot about him as a person,” said second-year linebacker Shane Ray . “He wants us to focus on the win and on the team, not on him. That’s of course when things got really emotional. But that tells you his character as a man, to keep that to himself, and allow us to play for each other and not for him. \n“We know he’s going through a lot of tough things, and his health has been tough this season. I’ve got all the love in the world for Kubiak. He chose me. I hope he finds what he wants to do now in his life and I hope he finds happiness.” \nKubiak suffered the second health scare of his coaching career in October, when he was hospitalized after a loss to the Falcons and diagnosed with a “complex migraine.” The symptoms were eerily similar to the ones he experienced in 2013, when he collapsed during halftime of a game when he was head coach of the Texans. \n“As a player, you don’t always notice, but this was a hard season for Coach Kubiak,” outside linebacker Von Miller said. “It was a tough season with the losses and injuries. You can see it wear him down. His health is the most important thing for us. The decision was a great decision for him and I’m going to continue to support him no matter what.” \nMany described the locker room after Sunday’s game as simply “sad” and “quiet.” Kubiak did most of the talking. They listened. And reflected on the last two seasons. \n“We love playing for him,” said safety Darian Stewart , who played for Kubiak in Baltimore in 2014 before rejoining him in Denver. “He’s the best coach I’ve played for, I loved it. We’re going to miss him a great deal. That’s our leader.” \nAmong his players — in Denver, Houston or Baltimore — Kubiak was regarded as more than a coach. Before players talk of his style on the sideline, they speak of his character. \n“He is a great person,” receiver Demaryius Thomas said. “Coach Kubiak always wanted for you to work hard for your brothers, the organization and he takes care of you. That was one of the big things; he made sure we were ready for the game health-wise. You just made sure that you went out and played for him and he took care of you.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T06:40:06.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
