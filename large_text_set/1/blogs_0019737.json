Neon beat out A24 and Netflix, who were also bidding on the film, Variety reports. The acquisition came two days after the film’s premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. \n“Ingrid Goes West” is a dark, dramatic comedy that follows about a troubled young woman named Ingrid (Plaza) who becomes obsessed with the Instagram account of a social media influencer named Taylor (Olsen).

The film also stars Wyatt Russell and Billy Magnussen. \nQuinn, the former co-founder of RADiUS, and League, co-founder and CEO of Alamo Drafthouse, purchased the Anne Hathaway monster movie “Colossal” at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and previously released Michael Moore’s “Where To Invade Next” in 2015. \nCAA negotiated the deal for “Ingrid Goes West.” \nThis Article is related to: News More From IndieWire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T02:10:50.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
