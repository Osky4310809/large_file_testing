I have decided to dispense our people from abstaining from meat,” Dolan wrote in a letter to parish pastors and administrators. “Please notify your parishioners.”\nSome Catholics around the country were asked to abstain from meat on Saturday if they indulge on St. Patrick’s Day — but Dolan is not asking for the same trade-off.\nDiMarzio has asked his flock to find another way to offer sacrifice.\n“I strongly encourage all who make use of this dispensation to engage in another sacrificial or charitable act that day,” he wrote in his decree.\nThe decision to suspend the centuries-old Lenten tradition left Big Apple beef eaters feeling exalted.\n“Luck of the Irish!” said Tom Lynch, 31. “God is watching over me and he is happy I’ve behaved.”\nMichael Romero, the manager of Carragher’s Pub, said the dispensation ultimately saved him from taking a big loss on meat.\n“If I were to put a percentage on the day, meat dishes would account for 70 percent of our revenue,” he said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:04:39.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
