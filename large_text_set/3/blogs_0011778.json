Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson bring their star power to the title track, providing a swoon-worthy radio single that easily stands on its own. Customer Reviews by Espinojr All of these are wonderful tracks from one the best animated movies of all-time. However, the version of \"Beauty and the Beast\" done by Jordin Sparks is truly terrible. This song is best left as a ballad and to try to make it anything else is nothing short of a crime against everything represented in this timeless tale.
