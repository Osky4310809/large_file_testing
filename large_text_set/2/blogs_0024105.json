Glenn Sovich. \nThe girls ran to their home and told their parents about what happened. The parents then alerted police. \nAfter reviewing surveillance footage, police recognized a car with Ohio plates from a previous incident. In that case, a man reportedly offered a teenage girl money to perform a sex act. \n“He asked if we were single, and then we said no, we’re young,” said one alleged victim. “Then, he said, ‘You wanna make money?’ and we said no, and he went down the hill.” \nWhile being questioned by police, Netherland claimed he did not know that the girls were underage. \nHe is now facing a list of charges including, corruption of minors and both felony and misdemeanor child luring counts. \nNetherland was a delivery driver for an Ambridge restaurant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:13:12.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
