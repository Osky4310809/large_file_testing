The Reds boss had urged everyone to remember that each fixture until the end of the season is “an opportunity to show what we are” and the message had been noted and executed against Chelsea. \nIn the opening 20 minutes, the most dazzling aspect of the visitors was Antonio Conte’s snow white trainers; the Italian displaying more movement on the touchline than his team could muster. But, as several teams have discovered, if you’re patient and organised enough to frustrate Liverpool, you have the chance to profit from their errors. Mark Clattenburg awarded a foul after a tussle between Adam Lallana and Eden Hazard, with Luiz quickly over it. \nWhile Mignolet was shouting defensive instructions, his eyes away from the danger, the 29-year-old got it up, over a three-man wall and in off the post. The Belgian’s protestations fell on deaf ears just as the whistle signalling the set-piece could be taken did on his. \nWhether he was ready or not, it was a sublime hit from Luiz and, with little being created, Chelsea typically maximised their one shot on target. Liverpool responded with fight to falling behind, but were still not causing their opposition rearguard much discomfort in what has been a wider story of their 2017. \nAfter the break it was back to probing for the hosts and, when they had Chelsea in real danger, Roberto Firmino horribly skied a sitter that had been created excellently through Lallana and Philippe Coutinho. \nJust when the ‘same again’ feel started to permeate the game, Jordan Henderson sent a brilliant ball out to James Milner on the left, who flicked it goalwards. The ball bounced off Victor Moses’ shoulder and, as he did against Manchester City, Gini Wijnaldum headed in. \nAnd, when it seemed like another punch in the gut was to be delivered to Liverpool in January with Costa winning a penalty on 76 minutes, Mignolet dived to his left to keep his side’s unbeaten record against the current top six intact. \nIt was a good point for the Merseysiders given the malaise that preceded the encounter and the fact that Arsenal suffered defeat at home to Watford and Tottenham were held by Sunderland. \nBut Liverpool will not have been entirely satisfied, and therein lies clues about their ambition under Klopp. “The feeling is that you're disappointed and if you do that against Chelsea, who are leading the Premier League, getting a lot of points, playing good football then it shows how hungry we are in the dressing room,” said Mignolet. \n“I think we deserved three points.” \nLiverpool must now ensure the rest of the season mirrors the stellar start of their campaign rather than the misery that has followed since the turn of the year.
