People have to go back to the agency again to obtain another clearance. We are inflicting too much suffering and pain on them,” he said. \nAlvarez said before one is issued an NBI clearance, he is usually required to obtain clearances from the courts and the prosecutor’s office as proof that he has no pending case. \nAlvarez noted that when a case is filed, the court or the prosecutor’s office “automatically sends the information to the NBI for record purposes.”   \n“But when the complaint is dismissed, automatic transmittal of such information does not happen and the accused has to go to the court and the prosecutor’s office for clearances,” he said. \nAlvarez said there should be an internet connection among courts, prosecutors and the NBI, so that a person obtaining a clearance applies only with the NBI and does not have to go to the other agencies. \n“The same should be true with other frontline agencies like the Land Transportation Office and Philippine Statistics Office, where people secure birth certificates,” he said. \nHe added that a birth certificate, like an NBI clearance, should be good for multiple uses. \nAlvarez pointed out that these government documents should remain useful for any purpose for their entire one-year expiration period. \nHe stressed that if his initiative materializes, it would bring a big relief to people requiring clearances. \nHe promised that the House of Representatives would give frontline agencies the necessary funds for online linkup with other offices. \nThe government would spend for it so there would be no need to hire private contractors, he said.
