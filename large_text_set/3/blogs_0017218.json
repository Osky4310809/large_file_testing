Such have been Britain’s dubious historic contributions to the Spanish city of Huelva. \nThe plant-lined Barrio Reina Victoria came first: a colony of cottages established by the British-run Rio Tinto Mining Company in 1873 while it plundered Andalucia for copper. Next followed Spain’s first football team, Recreativo de Huelva. Then, in 1943, Glyndwr Michael, a destitute Welshman who had died in London, arrived to play his part in Operation Mincemeat. Shipped to Huelva and dressed as a marine, his cadaver was abandoned in the port, along with fictitious plans detailing invasions in Greece and Sardinia, rather than Sicily as the British were planning. The deception wrong-footed the Nazis and tipped the balance of the Second World War. \nTwo centuries earlier, a more significant journey set sail across the Rio Tinto in Palos de la Frontera: Christopher Columbus sailed off on his first voyage. Today, Columbus is back as a handsome statue in Huelva’s main Plaza de las Monjas. \nThis maritime city, close to the Portuguese border and 60 miles west of Seville, isn’t as handsome as Granada or Cordoba but the city’s chief sell is its restaurant scene — this year Huelva takes its turn as Spain’s 2017 Capital of Gastronomy. Huelva is best known for fish. Mushroom risotto and fried cuttlefish are the dishes of choice here, washed down with a local white wine. Where to stay \nThe Eurostars Tartessos (00 34 959 282 711; eurostarshotels.com ) is a short stroll from Plaza de las Monjas. The 100 rooms are comfortable and spacious. Doubles from €49, room only. The NH Huelva (0034 959 250 011, nh-hotels.com ) is 10 minutes further from the action on a busy road. Doubles from €67. Eurostars Tartessos Where to eat and drink \nEvents for the Capital of Gastronomy year remain scanty but weekly focuses on local specialities are confirmed — to keep up to date, track the website, huelvacapitalgastronomica.com . One restaurant involved in the celebrations is Huelva’s top table, Acanthum (00 34 959 245 135; acanthum.com ). After two years at San Sebastian’s Arzak, Xanty Elias came home determined to shake up Huelva’s dining scene. His two tasting menus (from €74 with wine) change twice a year and might include pistachio, crumbled cookie and white-chocolate dust laid out as a map of the nearby marshes. He’ll also welcome other Spanish Michelin-starred chefs throughout 2017 for one-off dinners, €50 per person. The first is José Carlos García, a Malaga chef, on March 28. \nAmong the supporting cast, Kalaka (00 34 959 821 308; kalaka.es ) stands out. Innovative tapas are the thing here: think tuna tataki with beetroot purée and one of those local specialities, strawberries (€5). \nAt Puro Chup Chup (00 34 603 628 190; purochupchup.com ), options include razor clams in korma sauce, Peking duck tacos, a mash-up of noodles, chow mein, paella and pork ribs, or “fake lasagne” — whisky-marinated squid, chorizo and egg yolk under rice wafer (€5). Puro Chup Chup \nHuelvans are known as choqueros, such is their fondness for cuttlefish (choco). And any self-respecting choquero knows that the best place to sample choco frito (€9) is at no-frills seafood joint Paco Moreno (00 34 959 243 048). \nPlaza de las Monjas thrums on balmy Friday nights. The square’s Espacio Ruben’s (00 34 626 680 485, facebook.com/rubensbeerhuelva ) brews its own beers and is open until 3am. La Casa de los Quesos (00 34 626 967 927; lacasadelosquesos.com) offers a classier alternative, serving glasses of vermouth or tempranillo alongside cheeses into the evening. Where to shop Soho House Barcelona - hotel review \nSpecial occasion boutique Sara Merino y Celso Prieto (00 34 959 251 813; saramerino.com ) merits a visit. The store occupies a renowned bullfighter’s former villa, including stained-glass windows and a patio garden where lemon trees surround a pool. Tourists can mooch around and admire the grandeur. \nMore affordable clothing options await on Calle Concepción/Palacio/ Arquitecto Pérez Carasa/Berdigón — a paved lane which confusingly changes name almost every block. \nThe covered Mercado del Carmen is a good bet for premium olive oils, manchego cheese or bags of chicharron (crackling) — try Charcuteria Miguel Romero (00 34 615 174 709; facebook.com/miguelromerojamones ) at stand #105-6. What to do and see \nVisit Huelva three millennia ago and you might have encountered the mythical city of Tartessos, famed for its metal trading. Recent archaeological digs have strengthened a contention that Huelva stands atop the long-lost site. Scrutinise finds at the Museo de Huelva (00 34 959 650424; facebook.com/museo.huelva , free). \nThe replicas of Christopher Columbus’s ships at the Caravel Dock Museum (Alamy Stock Photo) \nColumbus spent two years at La Rábida Monastery (00 34 959 350 411) preparing for his odyssey. Outside are full-size replica ships. Entry is €3. Details: Huelva \nBritish Airways (0344 493 0787, ba.com ) flies three times a week from Gatwick to Seville from £76 return.
