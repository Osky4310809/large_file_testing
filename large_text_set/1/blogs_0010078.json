'Interesting biology' \n\"It regulated the balance of immune cells within the lung,\" Dr David Adams, one of the team, told the BBC News website. \n\"It changes the balance of cells that play a role in killing tumour cells and those that switch off the immune system.\" \nThe field of immunotherapy - harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer - has delivered dramatic results for some patients. \nA rare few with a terminal diagnosis have seen all signs of cancer disappear from their body, although the drugs still fail to work in many patients. \nDr Adams said: \"We've learnt some interesting new biology that we might be able to use - it's told us this gene is involved in tumour growth.\" \nDrugs that target Spns2 could produce the same cancer-slowing effect but that remains a distant prospect. \nDr Justine Alford, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"This study in mice gives a new insight into the genes that play a role in cancer spreading and may highlight a potential way to treat cancer in the future. \n\"Cancer that has spread is tough to treat, so research such as this is vital in the search for ways to tackle this process.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:37:48.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
