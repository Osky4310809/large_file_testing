(Rick Rycroft/AP) January 18, 2017, 1:34 AM Canadian Press January 18, 2017, 1:34 AM \nMELBOURNE, Australia — Canadian Eugenie Bouchard is back in the third round of the Australian Open for the first time in two years after defeating China’s Peng Shuai 7-6 (5), 6-2 on Wednesday. \nBouchard, who reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in 2014, finally closed it out after Peng saved three match points on the Canadian’s serve at 5-1 in the second set. \nFollowing her break-out year in 2014, which also saw her reach the Wimbledon final, Bouchard struggled to make it past the fourth round at the slams. Her best result last year was the third round at Wimbledon. \nHer next opponent will be either CoCo Vandeweghe or Pauline Parmentier, who played later Wednesday. \n\"Overall, I'm feeling better with each passing day,\" said Bouchard. \nBouchard, from Westmount Que., won the first set when she froze Peng with a forehand smash after the Canadian charged the net. \nEarlier, Vancouver's Vasek Pospisil and Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic dropped their first-round doubles match to the hometown pairing of Matthew Barton and Matthew Ebden, 6-2, 6-4. \nThe match took 63 minutes to complete. %2Ftennis%2Fatp%2Fbouchard-beats-peng-reaches-third-round-australian-open%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T08:54:47.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
