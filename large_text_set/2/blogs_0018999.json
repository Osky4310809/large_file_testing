By: FE Online | Updated: February 22, 2017 11:26 AM Chandrasekaran yesterday took over as the chief of Tata Sons, putting behind an acrimonious boardroom battle that saw the ouster of Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman. \nCongratulating N Chandrasekaran and appreciating his hardwork, Former TCS Chairman S Ramadorai on Wednesday said that Chandra has earned the Tata Group’s Chairman position. In a conversation with ET Now Ramadorai said, “Chandra’s key strengths are focus and problem solving. He is good at finding short-term solutions and troubleshooting”. “I have a small role to play in mentoring Chandra, I first noticed a spark in him in 1993 during a project in Washington,” he said recalling his earlier days. \nChandrasekaran yesterday took over as the chief of Tata Sons, putting behind an acrimonious boardroom battle that saw the ouster of Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Chairman. While entering the Bombay House a few minutes back, he said “will do everything to delight people who are proud of the group”. He added “it is an honour for me to assume this responsibility” and “will work with all entities to unite the group.” Popularly known as ‘Chandra’, the 54-year-old will be the first non-Parsi chairman of the 150-year old Tata Group. \nSo far he had been heading the largest software exporter TCS and is responsible for making it what it is today. Last week, Chandrasekaran had described his new assignment as “a very big job” with a large canvas, where there were “challenges and opportunities”. As he steps into the role of the head of the $103 billion conglomerate, many immediate pressing issues will greet him. \nYou may also like to watch: \nOne of his major focus areas will be the European operations of Tata Steel, particularly in the UK which has become a drag to the group after the unsuccessful acquisition of Corus. While Tata Steel has already started selling assets in the UK, Chandra will have to decide how much assets are to be put on the block and how much could be turned around, especially keeping in mind the implications of Brexit. #ChandraTimes at Tata Sons. @ShereenBhan speaks to his mentor S Ramadorai, Fmr Vice Chairman, TCS. pic.twitter.com/HNiE2ufXD1 \n— CNBC-TV18 News (@CNBCTV18News) February 21, 2017 \nOne of his major focus areas will be the European operations of Tata Steel, particularly in the UK which has become a drag to the group after the unsuccessful acquisition of Corus.
