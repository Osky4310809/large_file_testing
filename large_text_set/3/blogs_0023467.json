Hameed Ali (retd), on Wednesday, failed to appear before the Senate, contrary to the directive of the upper chamber. \nThe senate had asked Ali to appear before it at 10 a.m. on Wednesday in Customs uniform to explain the rationale for directing that vehicle owners should pay duty on their cars. \nPrompted by Ali’s seeming disrespect by refusing to appear before the senate as directed, senators at exactly 10.32 a.m. went into a closed-door session apparently to assess the situation and make a resolution. \nThe senators had last Thursday, turned back the comptroller-general from the chamber for not appearing in uniform, and rescheduled his appearance to Wednesday, with a definite position that he should appear in Comptroller-General of Customs uniform. \nThe senate had first invited Ali to appear before it on March 8 to brief it on the proposed policy for payment of Customs Duty by vehicles owners, no matter the age of the vehicle. \nHowever, Ali did not honour the invitation on the ground that he had a management meeting. \nNot satisfied with the reason, the senate issued a warrant mandating Ali to appear on March 16. \nBut, on Tuesday, Ali told State House correspondents that he would not be at the senate, citing advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation as the reason for his decision. \nHe said that he had written to the senate on the development, explaining that a case had been instituted in the court on the matter. \nHe said the AGF wrote to him, asking him and all parties to stay action on his summon to appear at the Senate in uniform, pending the determination of an originating summons filed by one Mohammed Ibrahim. \nA reliable source in the National Assembly said that though the appearance of the CG was listed as the fourth item on Wednesday’s Order Paper, he would not appear before the senate. \nThe item on the Order Paper was captioned “Briefing by the Comptroller-General of the Customs and Excise’’ and slated to be moved by the Leader of the Senate, Sen. Ahmed Lawan. \n(NAN)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:34:59.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
