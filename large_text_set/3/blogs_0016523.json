While some of it might come as a pleasant surprise, others can leave you quite shocked. While it would be perfect to factor in all the surprises, before you take the big step, sadly it doesn't work that way. We spoke to five women, who tell us about that one big thing that they wish they knew before tying the knot. That it'll get better \n\"One of my biggest fears was the fact that we were nothing like the ideal married couple. We fought every day, we didn't have a very exciting between the sheets routine, and I cried almost every day missing my old life. I spent the first nine months in pure panic, lying and pretending that everything was okay because I was afraid to face the problems. I wish someone had told me that it gets better. Putting two very different individuals together, in one house and in one room, is bound to be a little problematic initially.\" \nSrividya Shetty, 28 Talking about money is important \n\"It sounds like one of the most unromantic conversations to have, before your big day, however taking about money is as important as discussing your future plans. We avoided this topic till we got married, and that's when I realised that my husband was actually paying off three loans. I was planning to quit my job for a while, get settled, and then start working again. However that plan had to be chucked out real fast. I wish I had had the chat before we actually got married, so that I could plan my finances better.\" \nAnadya Khanna, 26, Delhi His family is as important as he is \n\"My husband's mother and I never saw eye to eye. We always had issues and I always pushed them away because, for me, nothing was more important that my relationship with my husband. Post marriage, I wish someone had asked me to sort out my issues with his family too. Now we can't seem to let go of the baggage, and things are awful during family holidays with his mom and me constantly avoiding each other.\" \nShipla Desai, 31, Bangalore Marriage is not a magic wand \n\"I am divorced from my husband, and if there's one thing I wish I knew before was the fact that marriage is not going to bring about any big personality changes. Before we tied the knot, he was a womaniser, and I always used to think that marriage will change him... sadly it didn't. Two-and-a-half years and a broken heart later, my advice is, if it doesn't feel right, it never will.\" \nSurabhi Malhotra, 30, Mumbai Marriage is not always a new chapter \n\"Of course marriage is a huge change, but sometimes, for your relationship, nothing really changes. I expected things to get more romantic, him to be more understanding, and the world to get rosier. We remained the same crazy, sometimes cranky couple, and I wish I knew that it was okay to not see a huge change in your relationship just because you are now married.\" \nAvantika Anand, 27, Mumbai", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:34:12.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
