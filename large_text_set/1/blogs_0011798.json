Leighton Meester’s new show looks ~nothing~ like Gossip Girl but we already feel like it’s going to be our new favorite comedy series. The show, Making History will premiere on March 5th on FOX . It also stars The Mindy Project and Happy Endings’ Adam Pally and The Carmichael Show writer Yassir Lester. \nThe show is about two college professors (Pally and Lester) who travel back in time to colonial Massachusetts. Things get a little hairy when it’s revealed that one of them is dating Paul Revere’s daughter, Deborah (Meester). Even more exciting, the creators of the show are Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, the masterminds behind The Lego Movie, 21 Jump Street , and The Last Man on Earth. \nCan you tell how excited we are? If you’ve somehow missed the glorious trailer for the show, check it out below: \nWe live in a world full of sci-fi and alternate reality television (which we love) but there’s only a handful of TV shows about history, and only one of them is a comedy. That’s why we’re so excited for Making History to fill a void in our lives. \nFOX The trailer alone has us setting our DVRs. Just some of the hijinks we’re looking forward to are Lester rallying a group of men in the a bar using the famous Jerry Maguire line, “show me the money,” Pally serenading Meester with an original song “My Heart Will Go On,” and a time-traveling duffle bag. \nSeriously, we’re already counting down the days until March 5th. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:08:12.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
