The organization recently announced that Vice President Mike Pence will be this year's recipient of the inaugural award, which recognizes \"public figures who have been consistent champions of the economic reforms that women need most,\" according to a press release.\nWait, rewind. What the heck? The IWF's choice for this award seems pretty darn misguided, given Pence's rocky history with women's rights. Allow us to remind you how the VP voted against equal pay while in Congress not once but three times . Not to mention he is staunchly against reproductive rights .\nIt's vital to note that the IWF is known to be an antifeminist and right-wing organization, but regardless, we can't help but be left scratching our heads in confusion over the fact that it has chosen such a sexist man as the recipient of this honor. The internet also responded to this news with a collective, well-deserved \"WTF?\", among other more eloquently phrased reactions.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Mike_Pence_Civil_Rights.htm", "http://iwf.org/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-brief-reminder-that-mike-pence-still-wants-to-control-your-uterus_us_57f404f8e4b04c71d6f07c54", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4TmKAIOArdIi9525D_k_HErtygY/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/21/902/n/38761221/6591a41794e3e5b5_GettyImages-647275830.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-22T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:06:35.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
