Most Popular By Charles P. Pierce Mar 24, 2017 WASHINGTONâ€”The Rules Committee of the House of Representatives met shortly after dawn on Friday to try and set up a process by which Paul Ryan's tax-cut plan could pass the full House at some point later in the day. On Thursday, after everything fell apart, the president* sent the head counselors at Camp Runamuck down to the Capitol to tell recalcitrant Republicans that what they had before them was his take-it-or-leave-it offer and that, if they chose not to pass it, then 24 million Americans wouldn't lose their health insurance, get sick, go broke and/or die.

Nobody involved in this debate is good enough to make that happen.
