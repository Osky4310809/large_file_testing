Rush-hour: Queues are expected on Wednesday (Jeremy Selwyn ) \nThe Waterloo & City line, which uses the same pool of drivers, will have no service at all on Wednesday. \nPeter McNaught, Operations Director for the Central line, said: “I apologise to customers for the disruption that this unnecessary strike will cause. \n“We have made all reasonable efforts to resolve this dispute through talking through the issues with the unions, and we have minimised the number of employees affected from over 30 to eight. Tube strike: Transport bosses have warned of travel chaos (Jeremy Selwyn ) \n“All of these moves are within the longstanding agreements we have made with the unions.

Everything you need to know about this week's Tube strike \nCostumers have been advised to complete their journeys by 11:30pm on Tuesday night, before the line closes. \nThe dispute is over the “forced” transfer of eight drivers from their home depots at the eastern end of the line to others in central London, including Earl’s Court, meaning they have further to travel. \nRMT leaders say it is being done without agreement – a claim robustly denied by London Underground (LU).

RMT union accuses Southern Rail of bullying as strike looms \n\"To up the ante, LU have now written to us confirming that they will be bulldozing through the displacements regardless. \n\"Let us be in no doubt, if LU are allowed to get away with this move on the Central Line they will start shunting drivers around at the drop of a hat regardless of the consequences. \n\"Our members will be sent out from pillar to post to plug gaps that are solely down to staffing shortages. \n\"With massive budget cuts in the pipeline at LU this is a straw in the wind as to how the company expects to operate in the future.\" \nTfL said: “These moves are in accordance with TfL’s agreements with the unions, which state that employees can be asked to work at any location on the network. \n“No further moves are planned.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:18:14.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
