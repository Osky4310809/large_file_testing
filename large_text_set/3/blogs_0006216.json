This is not low calorie, but was a lot more satisfying. I left off the olive and mozzarella garnish to reduce the sodium and used mini ravioli. Next time I'd puree the tomatoes because the chunks didn't add much to the soup and tasted acidic with the other ingredients. I think a more tomato soup like base would enhance the flavor.\" MY REVIEW dojoiseli User ID: 5553805 227408 Reviewed Jun. 4, 2015 \n\"This soup is great! We add more broth and stewed tomatoes so we have more broth for bread dipping. Tortellinis work well. We've also added zucchini. Made this several times. Kids like it too.\" MY REVIEW mbaulch User ID: 7600486 216683 Reviewed Jan. 2, 2015 \n\"This was a tasty and easy soup to make...four teenagers gave it rave reviews!!\" MY REVIEW pudgeman User ID: 7087770 138976 Reviewed Jan. 11, 2014 \n\"My family loves pizza, however we try to eat less pizza and more healthy soups. This soup has a wonderful pizza taste, yet it has a lot less calories. It tastes great on a cold winter night.\" MY REVIEW Granille User ID: 7404175 151977 Reviewed Oct. 6, 2013 \n\"This was a hit with 2 generations of my family. Served it as a Saturday night dinner after watching in pouring rain grandsons football games, \"flag\"& tackle. It was a meal all by itself. For those who wanted \"heat\" put a shaker of crushed red pepper flakes and bottle of hot sauce on the table. Crunchy hot Italian dinner rolls completed the dinner .\" MY REVIEW WendiWendy User ID: 6260915 198807 Reviewed Sep. 16, 2013 \n\"This was absolutely delicious! Made the recipe exactly as stated and the flavor is phenomenal. (We did leave off the cheese and olive garnish -- it didn't seem to need it.) Next time I'll try this with tortellini, just because they are smaller and fit better on the spoon. There WILL be a next time -- this recipe is   dianeve User ID: 643652 197775 Reviewed Jul. 15, 2013 \n\"My family thought the soup was alright, but not great, so I won't make it again.\" Similar Recipes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:14:43.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
