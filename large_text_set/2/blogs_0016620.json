It is independent of the resettlement arrangement with respect of Manus and Nauru”, they said at the time. \nBack in September, Prime Minister Turnbull was adamant there would not be reciprocal exchanges of refugees. \n“It’s not linked to any other resettlement discussions,” said Mr Turnbull. \n“But clearly we are always working to find resettlement options for refugees and as you know Peter Dutton and (Foreign Minister) Julie Bishop have worked tirelessly to find resettlement option.” \nLabor’s foreign affairs spokesman told Sky “it does appear as though this was a deal done by Malcolm Turnbull but, that’s not what he said last year” \nHe said: “I mean, look, everyone knew it was a deal, and last night Peter Dutton, playing politics as always, belled the cat when he made it clear that it was contingent that taking people from Costa Rica was contingent on America taking those from Manus and Nauru, so clearly this was a deal.” Peter Dutton has admitted the government ‘wouldn’t take anyone until we had assurances that people are going to go off Nauru and Manus’.
