As part of the interview, Cravalho described her audition process for Moana –and revealed that she initially didn’t try out, because she was too busy with science! “I was a freshman,” she said, “I was in honors biology, and I had no time for anything else but microbes.” However, after the casting director for Disney saw Cravalho in an unrelated group audition for a nonprofit, she reached out and asked her to audition. “I’m just thanking my lucky stars I said yes,” said Cravalho.\nIn the interview , Cravalho also talked about the importance of Polynesian representation, what it was like collaborating with The Rock and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and her next project: a pilot called Drama High at NBC.\nIce Cube is reportedly one of the top choices to voice Miles Morales’ father, Jefferson Davis, in the animated Spider-Man film.
