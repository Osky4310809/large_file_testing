He told Sunday Times Style that going home to the U.K. to spend time with his mom and enjoy her homemade cooking gave him the opportunity to get back in touch with himself. \nHe also opened up about his past struggle with anxiety. Last June, Malik canceled his Summertime Ball set , citing panic attacks and severe performance anxiety. \"I flew into the UK last night to appear in my home country in front of my family, friends, and most importantly my UK fans. Unfortunately my anxiety that has haunted me throughout the last few months around live performances has gotten the better of me ... with the magnitude of the event, I have suffered the worst anxiety of my career,\" he wrote on his Twitter account at the time. \"I cannot apologize enough but I want to be honest with everyone who has patiently waited to see me, I promise I will do my best to make this up to everybody I've let down today. I know those who suffer anxiety will understand and I hope those who don't can empathize with my situation.\" \n\"People saw strength in that, and they didn't seem to expect it from a guy, but they expect it from a female, which to me is crazy,\" Malik told Sunday Times Style . \"We're all human. People are often afraid to admit difficulties, but I don't believe that there should be a struggle with anything that's the truth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:44:28.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
