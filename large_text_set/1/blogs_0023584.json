That's why I would never become a coach.\" \nRonaldinho reached the pinnacle of the game with Barcelona, but it was at PSG that he made his name in Europe, and he remembers his time at the Parc des Princes fondly. \nRamos issues Real rallying cry \n“Everyone respects me here and gives me a lot of hugs,\" he added. \"It's a club that I love so much. I do not know why people love me so much here - I am speechless when I see it all. \n“I am a son of PSG. When I arrived here, the gates of Europe were opened for me. \n“My time here was very special. There were the games against Marseille and Bordeaux, the goal against Guingamp... these are moments that I cannot forget. To choose a favourite is impossible. \nMan City trio hint at bright future \n“I often speak with people who work at the club or who play here. The change of direction has not changed anything. There are still people who are here who were here in my day. I still keep in touch.” \nMeanwhile, the free agent picked a rather surprising choice as his favourite in this PSG side that includes Edinson Cavani, Angel Di Maria, Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura. \n“Thiago Motta,” Ronaldinho said, \"for me, he’s class. I love to see him play, he is different from all the others. We played together for a long time [at Barcelona] and that's why I know him well.\" \nRonaldinho did concede he has one regret from his two years spent at PSG between 2001 and 2003. \n“Not winning a title is something that still makes me sad today,” he said. “In my time there was a nice team with Jay-Jay Okocha, Nicolas Anelka, Aloisio ... It is a pity that things did not go well. \n“Today, there are great players and it is certain that playing in this team would have been a pleasure. But my time here was the best of my life.” \nPSG are chasing another Ligue 1 title, but lie three points off Monaco’s pace ahead of Sunday’s meeting in the French capital.
