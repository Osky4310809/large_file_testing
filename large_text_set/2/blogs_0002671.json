They allow us to log various statistics, from the distance of a morning jog to the time spent lifting weights in the evening. If you're in the market for an app to help you record and make sense of all this data, there are plenty to choose from. Here are the best apps for tracking your health and fitness on Android, staying motivated and achieving your New Year's Resolution. How to use your phone as a heart-rate monitor Best heart rate monitor: Instant Heart Rate \nIt's important to track your heart rate during the different stages of your fitness regimen. Whether this is before, during or after your workout, you should keep an eye on it. Instant Heart Rate gives you accurate heart rates when you need them so you can reach your fitness goals. \nThere are plenty of heart rate monitoring apps out there that track through a camera system but Instant Heart Rate has some features that sets it apart. When you're working out, you can see what your heart rate is and check if it's moving towards the goal you want it to. For instance, you should have a different heart rate for weight loss and cardio and the app measures that. \nInstant Heart Rate's tracking system gives you a timeline of your heart rate so you can track whether you've been hitting your cardio or fat-burning goals. You can also track your resting heart rate to look at the unhealthy stress put on your heart under normal conditions. The Pro version of the app is $2.99 and features unlimited heart rate tracking and no ads. Track your heart rate over time with the Instant Heart Rate app. / © AndroidPIT Instant Heart Rate Best for measuring your body fat: BMI Calculator \nIf you ever wondered how you're doing with your goals of eliminating excess body fat, then you should try BMI Calculator.

Google Fit: Android's default fitness app. / © AndroidPIT Google Fit - Fitness Tracking Best all-rounder: RunKeeper \nRunKeeper has a good reputation, not just for the number of features in its own app but also the number of third-party services it plugs into (it works with both Google Fit and Apple Health). If you're a keen runner, there aren't many better options than this one. RunKeeper offers maps and statistics. / © AndroidPIT \nYou can plot your runs on a map via GPS tracking, monitor distance covered and calories burned, set personal goals, integrate your indoor activities and more.

The app is free, but also has ads and optional in-app purchases. Runkeeper - GPS Track Run Walk Best for cyclists and runners: Strava \nAnother well-known app with a strong reputation, Strava comes with a host of handy features, both in the core of the app and via separate add-ons. By tracking your running and bike riding via GPS, Strava can help you beat your own personal bests and challenge your friends as well. \nStrava lets you track distance, pace, speed, elevation and other statistics as you go, and thanks to the data that's been collected from all of Strava's users, you can check out some of the routes that are popular with other people – even if you're a long way from home. Strava covers both running and cycling. / © AndroidPIT Strava Running and Cycling GPS Best for workout jams: Spotify Running \nA lesser known feature of the popular music streaming app is its feature called Spotify Running.

Pick a playlist, start running and Spotify will detect your tempo automatically and play music to match. You can also manually adjust your tempo. / © AndroidPIT \nWhat's your favorite fitness app?
