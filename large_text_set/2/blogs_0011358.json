To her credit, the Kapamilya actress has refused to become bitter over a lost love. \nShe is loveless by choice. But that does not mean she is through with relationships. \n“If you love the person, and you think he’s worth taking the risk for, go ahead,” she gives her advice to those dilly-dallying over love. \nEven then, she is the type who knows when to hope and when to stop pining for someone, or something. For her, it is either someone comes into your life at the right time, at the right place, or not at all. \n“You don’t even have to lift a finger. If the person is right for you, love shouldn’t be hard to find,” she told writers at the presscon of ABS-CBN’s new suspense-drama, “The Better Half,” where she stars with JC de Vera, Carlo Aquino, Denise Laurel, Epi Quizon, and Carmi Martin, among others. \nShaina plays Camille, whose life turns upside down after her husband Marco (Carlo) had an accident and she meets Rafael (JC). Just when things seem to be going Camile’s way, Marco returns – this time, as somebody else’s (Denise’s) husband. \nShaina admits Camille’s struggles to move on are similar to hers in real life. \n“I can relate to my character, so I totally embraced the role.” \nShaina herself is struggling with questions about entering into a new relationship. She is not ready for one, even if she has been loveless for quite some time. \nVina Morales’s sister and the youngest of four children has seen her older siblings’ relationship struggles and learned from them. \nShaina thanks her lucky stars that she was born as the youngest in the family. \n“It gives a big advantage,” she mused. “I’ve seen what my sisters went through and I learn from their mistakes.” \nThis makes her extra careful about choosing the guy she’ll fall in love with the next time around. Shaina knows how important it is to make herself complete before sharing her life again with another. \n“I have to go through a process. I have to take my time so I’ll be sure of myself. I have to be whole, so I can share more (with the man I love),” she explained. \nAnd when the time comes, Shaina promises to share her joy with friends from the press. \nAlthough she has proven that she can combine love and career, Shaina would rather focus on work for now. \n“The year started right for me. ‘Better Half’ is airing earlier than expected (it kicked off last February 13). And I’m overwhelmed. I think I still have a purpose in being part of this industry.” \nUnlike Vina, who started as a singer, Shaina’s first love is acting. The former child actress began acting at seven, when she was cast in the lead role of the drama series “Lyra.” \nAs she gets caught up in “The Better Half’s” twists and turns, and in her character’s intense emotions, Shaina will not allow anything – even love – to get in the way. \nThat is how devoted she is to work. And that is how Shaina has managed to stay in the industry for more than two decades – with actors who are just as serious with their craft, stoking that inner fire that continues to consume them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:02:22.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
