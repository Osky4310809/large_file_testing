Everyone sort of looks like someone else, and that someone else will oftentimes be a famous person. \nThink about it, there is only X amount of different face combinations in the world to combine with only a few different hairstyles and skin tones. \nThe world isn’t full of human snowflakes (unless you ask Tomi Lahren), with each one completely different. \nSo when someone says they know someone who is a doppelganger of someone else, it is usually not the case. Usually it just means someone kind of looks like the other person. \nMy mom used to say I was Russell Crowe’s doppelganger. I am not. We are both white mails with black hair.
