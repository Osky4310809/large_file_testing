Theis and Singh additionally claim gender and race discrimination respectively. \nThe previous, generous judicial pensions provided an income of a 40th of a judge’s final pensionable pay multiplied by his or her length of service. It also gave a lump sum on retirement after the age of 65 of two and a quarter times the annual rate. \nThe employment tribunal judgment found that the MoJ and the lord chancellor, who is now the justice secretary, Liz Truss , had discriminated against younger judges by requiring them to leave the judicial pension scheme in April 2015 while allowing older judges to remain in it. That discrimination could not be justified, the tribunal judge Stuart Williams concluded. \nShubha Banerjee, of the law firm Leigh Day who represented 204 of the judges, said: “This is a great victory for our clients, many of whom sit alongside older judges who were appointed some years after them but who are, in effect, paid more purely because they are older. \n“The fact that there is a significant number of female and BME judges in the younger group simply compounds the unfairness of the changes that were made to judicial pensions. \n“According to Judicial Office statistics, about one-third of all judges in England and Wales last year were female, and only 7% described themselves as from a black or other minority ethnic background.” \nThe tribunal found that the changes caused younger judges to suffer a disproportionate loss to their pensions purely because they were younger. The finding could affect other public sector groups, such as teachers, firefighters and prison officers, who have had their pension rights reduced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:07:49.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
