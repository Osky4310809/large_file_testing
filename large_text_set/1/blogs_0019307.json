LOUIS • Bringing Major League Soccer to St. Louis always hinged on the Board of Aldermen and city voters, but now it likely will involve a judge. \nAs Tuesday’s 10-week deadline expires for the Board of Aldermen to approve propositions for the April 4 elections, soccer supporters hope late action by the board will save the proposal. \nIf the board passes the public funding proposal, the city has until Feb. 21 to get a circuit court judge to put it to voters, according to state law. \nThe $60 million city funding portion for a 22,000-seat stadium west of Union Station was tabled Thursday at the city’s Ways & Means Committee after disagreements among aldermen. SC STL vice chairman Jim Kavanaugh said the plan isn’t being renegotiated, but “we are validating the numbers to make sure everyone’s on the same page.” \nAldermen are also being asked to abate an entertainment tax on ticket sales at the new stadium, but official estimates on what that amount might be have not been made available. \nLast week the city’s budget director Paul Payne said he lacked confidence that the financial agreement wouldn’t ultimately dip into the city’s general revenue fund. A spokesman for Comptroller Darlene Green declined to comment Monday. \nThe proposal’s intent is to use only new revenue from a business use tax increase triggered if voters approve a half-cent sales tax increase for MetroLink expansion and other city services. \nThe MetroLink ballot proposal would also need approval by the Board of Aldermen and a judge to make the April 4 ballot. It was heard but not voted on at Thursday’s committee meeting. \nMayor’s Office spokeswoman Maggie Crane said they expect a hearing on both proposals this week. Such a hearing would require 24-hour advance notice under the state’s Open Meetings Law. \nWays and Means Committee chairman Stephen Conway, 8th Ward, said he will hold a meeting when the different sides tell him they’re ready. \n“We will do that because no matter what the outcome is, it’s in our best interest to address all these issues,” Conway said. \nA new hearing had been posted for Monday of this week, but was later removed and not published in the official board calendar. \nMeanwhile, MLS officials have said all candidates for expansion teams have until Jan. 31 to apply. SC STL investor and executive committee member Dave Peacock said investors will submit a plan by that date as long as the soccer stadium bill isn’t defeated before then. \nMLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche did not say Monday whether the league views the Jan. 31 deadline as negotiable. Courtemanche said he has “not heard any discussion related to a change in deadline.” \nSC STL would provide $95 million in private financing for the stadium. The state, which owns the 24-acre site, may commit to pre-construction development and clearance of the land before selling or leasing it to the city. \nGov. Eric Greitens has said he opposes public spending for stadiums, but has not said what role if any the state would have in preparing the site for construction.
