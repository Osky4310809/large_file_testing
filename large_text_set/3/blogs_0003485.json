He entered Sunday's game against the Knicks in the middle of a major slump, shooting 29 percent from 3 in that span. \nHead coach Steve Kerr knew that Curry will eventually break out of the slump, but he wanted to keep his superstar's confidence up in the meantime. Awesome moment here between Curry and Kerr pic.twitter.com/rRGNVPRinS â€” Full Court Prez (@fullcourtprez) March 5, 2017 \nDuring a mic'd up conversation between Kerr and Curry, we were able to listen to Kerr's encouraging words. As odd as it sounded, Kerr told Curry to stop looking at his shooting numbers and brought up his impressive plus-minus from Sunday. Anything, really, to get Curry back to himself. \nThe best part had to be the ending, though: \"Carry on, my son,\" Kerr said as Curry left the bench. \nThat ended up being just what Curry needed to hear as he had 27 points and was plus-19 through three quarters, including a deep 3 at the third-quarter buzzer. \nCarry on.
