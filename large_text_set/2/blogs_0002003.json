Mallika, also known popularly as her alter ego, \"make-up didi \", is all we wish to be, in humour and just plain chilled-outness. So when we met her today, we just had to know her secrets to surviving all that is fashion week. And in true make-up didi fashion, she said: \n\" Dekhiye, thoda jaus peejiye...apne aap ko hydrets karna zaroori hai .\" \n\" Jaus phace pe mat lagaaiye, phace pe crems lagaaiye . And invest in a very nice, jusy beby creams.\" \n\" Aur thoda freewts aur salads hi khaaiye aap...kyunki yahaan par logon ko dekhke, ekdum aisi philings aane lagti hai... \" \n\" Kapde pehno thode aeji type, jisse dekhke chahe ajeeb hi ho, lekin thode different lage . That's fayshun, ok? Jusht be yauself. Be comfortable, chahe aapko ghagra kyun na pehenna pade. \" A video posted by iDiva (@idivaofficial) on Feb 1, 2017 at 4:40am PST \nSo, there you have it. To survive Fashion Week, and dare we say it, life in general, do as Mallika Dua says: drink jaus, hydrets yourself (hydration is the key to good skin, after all), put crems on your phace, but more importantly, be yauself!
