For all the Ellie Saabs and Stella McCartneys spotted on the red-carpet, there is a pack of gorgeous gowns showing list-topping promise. The most-awaited night of the year, now, also invites a list of painstakingly-sourced designer labels. \nHere’s all the dope on the designers who our mainstream actresses are wearing, to spell Insta-winning fashion. 1.Yanina Couture \nIf Sonam Kapoor’s standing ovation-deserving ballerinas don’t strike a chord, then the actress twinning with bestie Jacqueline Fernandez, in layers of lavender tulle, most definitely will. Yanina Couture is steadily, and rightfully so, becoming a red-carpet regular. Boss-lady Yulia Yanina has two decades of heavy-duty couture behind her. And, we’re behind her ethereal wedding aisle-worthy creations, 100 percent.

Her posing antics aside, the trailing Ali Younes gown that she recently walked in, headed straight to our secret Pinterest boards. That and the black form-fitting one, worn by Sridevi. Stylist Tanya Ghavri (responsible for all these looks) is, obviously, smitten with the Kuwait-based label. Looking at their Ellie Saab-meets-Naeem Khan sensibility, we aren’t surprised why.

That Mark Bumgarner is a former Formula racer is wildly unbelievable. Thank God for the fashion world, the Filipino designer took a detour and his designs were lapped up by the rich and famous.

Recently, an outfit by the designer was chosen by Deepika Padukone while on her promotional tour. The too-cool-for-a-blazer suit was a master class in how suits should be worn in 2017 - Sans the lapels and with plunging necklines.

After having learnt from the masters at Christian Dior, Emanuel Ungaro, Guy LaRoche, and Christian Lacroix, the German designer has a store in Milan to his name. We have our eyes dead set on this new age bride’s go-to-couturier.
