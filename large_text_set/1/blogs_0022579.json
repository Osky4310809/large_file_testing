I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions & offensive words. It was inexcusable & I'm so sorry. \n— Katie Rich (@katiemaryrich) January 23, 2017 \nRich made her account private, although she would later make a public apology tweet, which conspicuously did not apologize directly to the Trump family.   \nRich’s tweet was so offensive that even Chelsea Clinton seemed to admonish Rich in a tweet, although she couldn’t help getting in a shot at President Trump. Barron Trump deserves the chance every child does-to be a kid. Standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids. \n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 22, 2017 \nRich’s original tweet sparked condemnation around the Twittersphere, as well as charges of a double standard.

Last November, leftist talk show host Rosie O’Donnell made news by re-tweeting a video that claimed that Barron Trump had autism. Rosie would pull a Rich and make her account private and then apologize.
