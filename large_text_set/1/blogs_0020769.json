Now, the Love & Hip Hop star has more explanation for what he’d like from a relationship with his former lover. \nIn an interview with Power 105.1’s DJ Self and Jason Lee from Hollywood Unlocked, Safaree is asked if he wants Nicki back. \n“Not in the light of bringing it back to what it was, but just on the work tip, I think the culture needs that,” he says. \nHe adds that he has no hard feelings toward the Queens rapper even as he threatened to sue her for unpaid royalties. \n“I’m a loving guy,” he continues. “I have love for everybody. There’s not a hateful bone in me, no matter what anyone has done, unless they killed my mom or something like that, but other than that, I love everybody.” \nSafaree reveals that he isn’t up on Nicki’s social media as they’ve both blocked each other, but people continue to ask the question of if they are getting back in touch. \n“I really got a dollar every time somebody said that to me, I would have a billion dollars this week,” he says. \nIn regards to taking Meek Mill to the boxing ring, Safaree was more than ready to answer who would win in a three-round bout. The Philly rapper claimed in an Instagram video that he’d fight Drake with Nicki as the ring girl. Safaree commented on the post “Drake don’t got time but I do.” \n“C’mon, that’s not even a question,” he says. “I’d love to see it happen.” \nListen to the interview with Safaree below.
