News : \n\"At first, Selena and Abel wanted to keep their relationship a secret. But they've decided they really don't care if everyone knows about them.\" \nWell, based on that seXXXy snap of their lusty lip-lock, it's pretty clear no f*cks were given about getting caught! LOLz! \nAnother insider explained to the outlet just how this precious pair came to be, saying: \n\"Selena was focusing on getting herself back together and Abel was just getting out of a relationship, plus putting out his new album. Abel and Bella also were on and off towards the end of their relationship, so getting into something brand new was not what Abel was looking for.\" \nAnd the confidante confessed the 26-year-old had the hots for the former Disney darling for a while, adding: \n\"Abel though always had a thing for Selena. He thinks she is extremely talented and sexy. They recently started talking before the holidays but she has been on his radar before. They are on the same level with expectations and think the other is really fun. They are taking things slow and getting to know each other.\" \nH . \nWe wonder if that crush first started when they both performed at the 2015 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show !
