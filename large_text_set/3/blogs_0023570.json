Each of the three gentlemen we posed our two questions to - what was the first lens you designed and what is your favorite lens - has decades of experience designing Canon glass. \nMasato Okada (center), the Deputy Chief Executive of Image Communication Products and Operations, first began designing lenses for Canon back in 1982. Meanwhile, Kenichi Izuki (right), the Plant Manager and Masato Okada (left), the Deputy Chief Executive of Image Communication and Products Operations, have each been designing Canon lenses since the late 80's/early 90's. It takes decades of experience to design a lens like the Canon EF 16-35mm F2.8L III USM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:24:10.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
