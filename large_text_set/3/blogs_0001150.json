(Photo: AP Images) More Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner were arguably responsible for making choker necklaces all the rage again in 2016, but we thought we’d seen the last of this accessory when Taylor Swift wore one one onstage in October — and may or may not have made an ominous statement by doing so. But, like most ’90s trends, the choker just got bigger and badder … and inevitably, men started rocking them (no judgments). Then, outgoing first daughter Malia Obama thrust chokers back into the spotlight by breaking out at a delicate black one at dad’s televised farewell speech on Jan. 11. And she seems to have passed the fashion torch to new first daughter Ivanka Trump , who was photographed wearing a thin black choker on Tuesday in the Oval Office as President Trump signed a bill that is meant to encourage girls and women to pursue careers in STEM fields: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics . There to witness the event were other women in the president’s life, including wife Melania — impeccably dressed as always in a red frock that coordinated with her daughter-in-law’s blazer — Representative Barbara Comstock and Senator Deb Fischer. The bill, dubbed the (INSPIRE) Women Act, “ensures that the existing NASA programs recruit women to STEM-related jobs and aerospace careers,” the president said, according to WhiteHouse.gov . The other bill the president signed that day was the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act, which “amends the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to authorize the National Science Foundation to encourage its entrepreneurial programs to recruit and support women to extend their focus beyond the laboratory and into the commercial world.” Even though she is a fashion entrepreneur, Ivanka Trump is not only influential when it comes to setting a stylish tone. She’s also been known to champion women’s rights, making it apropos for her to be present during the signing of two bills that ensure “the future is female.” In November, Ivanka gave a speech at the Republican National Convention declaring she would never stop fighting for women’s issues. The future is apparently still about chokers too, as first families are known to influence fashion trends, from Jackie Kennedy’s effortless class to Michelle Obama’s relatable and inclusive fashion sense. While Ivanka’s eponymous line of accessories include a number of choker necklaces, and she’s rarely spotted in the accessory herself — or, she hasn’t been since the ’90s. We’ve yet to see if this style statement on Ivanka’s part will help keep the choker trend alive — or if she was just trying to accentuate her impossibly long and elegant neck.
