'Satisfied' \nAn online petition calling for Sir Philip to be stripped of his knighthood has attracted nearly 150,000 signatures. \nMPs backed the move in a non-binding motion in the Commons last year, but any decision would have to be taken by the Honours Forfeiture Committee. \nSir Philip's contribution is significantly less than the £571m pensions deficit BHS was left with. \nBut he said it was \"significantly better\" than schemes entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). \n\"The settlement follows lengthy, complex discussions with the Pensions Regulator and the PPF, both of which are satisfied with the solution that has been offered,\" he said. \n\"All relevant notices, including legal matters and claims from the regulator, have been withdrawn, bringing this matter to a conclusion.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T07:49:05.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
