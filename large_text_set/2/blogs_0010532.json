File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - The Bureau of Customs (BOC) is set to probe deeper into reports of rampant vehicle, oil and cigarette smuggling in the country, which has resulted in more than P50 billion in lost revenues for the government. \nIn a statement, the BOC said motor vehicle, oil and cigarette smuggling post the highest tax leakages, accounting for almost 11 percent of the agency’s 2017 collection target of P467.9 billion. \nCiting its records, Customs said the government loses P22.5 billion in revenues from oil smuggling and P16 billion from contraband cigarettes. \nAnother P21 billion are lost from vehicle smuggling, according to data from Global Financial Integrity and the International Monetary Fund. \nCustoms commissioner Nicanor Faeldon has directed its intelligence and investigation service to look further into these illegal activities. \nThe BOC has so far collected a list of companies which are suspected to be engaged in the smuggling of the three products.

The department said these cases are currently subject to court litigations, and will hopefully face administrative penalties soon. \nOil smuggling commonly occurs through pilferage (siphoning off of oil from tankers to barges in high seas and then to oil trucks on land delivery to depots), while vehicle smuggling are carried out through misdeclaration, misclassification, or undervaluation. \nCigarette smuggling also happens from non-payment of duties and taxes, aside from the use of fake tax stamps.
