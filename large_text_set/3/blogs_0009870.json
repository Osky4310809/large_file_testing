How the hell does it always take three tries before you find the right way to plug it in?\nThe MicFlip is the first Micro USB cable in the world to address this problem. It’s fully reversible on both ends, so you never have to think about how you’re plugging it in again.\nI have never nerded out so hard over a USB cable the way I am over Winnergear's MicFlip reversible Micro USB-to-USB Type-A cable. ~Mashable\nThe only real gripe we’ve had with the MicFlip is that it’s that it’s remained fairly pricy for what it is. On Amazon , it’s still going for $25.\nHowever, Tech Deals is currently offering the exact same cable for 44 percent off . You can snag a 6-foot MicFlip reversible cable for just $13.99 . That’s a pretty good deal in our book.\nIs this deal not quite right for you? Head over to the AAPICKS HUB for more offers you’re going to love!
