LICSW. Raising leaders & changing the world one family at a time. www.sarinanatkin.com Feb 17 I Will Not Be A Bystander Photo by my grandfather, Isaac Morhaime , 42nd Infantry Rainbow Division As I watched Thursday’s press conference, I sat furiously typing what I heard. Each astounding quote became a new Facebook post, and with each one, other friends joined in. In my home, by myself, I was able to share this excruciating 77 minutes with friends across the country. Together we witnessed. Yes, I was preaching to the choir. I knew transcripts would be available shortly, I knew we would be analyzing this presser for years to come. Yet, I could not stop. As evening came, and I was able to process what happened for me, I wrote the following message on Facebook. Because so many have asked to share this with others, I am daring greatlyandposting it here. I may be flamed and I may receive horrifying messages, but calling on my favorite words from Senator Mitch McConnell: “nevertheless, she persisted.” There are those who may be wondering about my sanity today as I documented what I was hearing at Trump’s press conference. Let me explain a bit…. I took a university course in Israel on the Holocaust taught by a leading expert. It was an academically challenging course, much harder than I had at any point at my university back home. It was brutal emotionally, and took me a long time to resolve my anger at the United States for not getting involved sooner. We started way, way, back and moved through post World War II. The discomfort in the room was palpable as we went through 1000 years of persecution and anti-Semitism moving toward the final solution. How is it, that for so long, we have been hated so much? If it’s happened this many times, will it happen again? We were desperate to make sense of a senseless word. Yet deeper we went; picking apart media, the policies in Germany and around the world that allowed it to happen. And Hitler. A master or propaganda who built a regime based on lies. The real news, the reality of what was happening? You can bet he shouted FAKE NEWS over and over again . There were many clues, many signs. Many Jews arguing, “it just can’t be,” “it’s not that bad.” Of course they would; people around the world would too…who could imagine what was happening? But the United States of America? Our country? This country knew so much. They said, “the news must be fake; just war propaganda.” The United States of America did nothing, for a long time. Not only that, they actively turned away those fleeing, including children . The kicker? My grandfather was in one of the first units to enter Dachau. As a Jew, in the infantry, he was upfront, capturing some of the first images that would be used by the Associated Press. The United States sat unwilling to let Jewish immigrants in, yet happy to send Jews off to fight. Sound familiar? Democrat, Republican, Independent. This is not the time for politics. In fact, this presidency has actually made me more accepting, with greater openness to the story and pain of others. I got the message loud and clear post election: so many were hurting and we were not listening. This presidency, this administration is different. The hatred. The denial of facts. The avoidance of mentioning Jews in the Holocaust statement. The refusal to answer the questions. This is the strategy the Nazis used. This is the language of Holocaust deniers. This is not ok. Not even close to ok. My anger and frustration is not just at this administration. I am angry that members of my community, a people that have been oppressed and expelled and exterminated, are accepting this, and shaming me for saying it. Standing idly by will just not do. My documenting today, my telling of these absurd statements, it was my way of saying this will not go silently by. I will not turn a blind eye. Do I think they are coming for the Jews in the United States? Not likely. Do I think they are going after all of us? Attempting to shove through policies filled with hatred to those that are different than them? Absolutely. Hillel says, “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, who am I? If not now, when?” Ethics of the Fathers, 1:14 I will not be a bystander.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:10:48.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
