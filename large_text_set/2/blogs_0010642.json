Search Tech Trader Daily2 February 8, 2017, 12:59 P.M. ET ServiceNow CEO Slootman: ‘Disruption Will Be Epic’ As Humans Leave the Equation By Tiernan Ray \nFrank Slootman , chief executive of cloud computing software technology vendor ServiceNow ( NOW ), was kind enough to take a few minutes to talk with me today about the outlook for the IT industry, following results on January 25th for the company that “crushed” Q4 expectations, in the view of bulls. \nSlootman, who’s been running ServiceNow for six years, focused on the end of work as we know it, as an era when “machines help humans” gives way to an era when “humans help machines.” ServiceNow CEO Frank Slootman. ServiceNow Inc. \n“ The disruption will be epic ,” he said. “It’s a creative destruction kind of thing.” \nSlootman offers the anecdote of having visited “a large bank” the other day, and meeting with a senior technology executive there. The company “is going systematically through 18,000 IT people and asking, What are these people doing?” he tells me. \nCompanies, like this bank, are “really going after staffing” as an area where they can find cost savings, and improved operating performance. \n“That focus on disintermediating processes is very intense right now,” said Slootman. “You figure, 1,000 people is a hundred million [in costs] to the bottom line.” \n“The targets I heard yesterday are cutting a $1 billion out of a $13 billion cost basis.” \nSlootman said of such an ambition, “That’s reasonable; they will probably get it by a gradual disintermediation of processes.” \nThis is nothing more, he says, then what is already going on in consumer technology, where cloud computing is taking over the various everyday tasks that would otherwise require human input: Look at the consumer side of things. The structuring of workflow automation is much further along there. Look at Amazon or Facebook or Uber. They are very very smart in how they use data. They have externalized the services interfaces. Look at your Uber car request. The system does the dispatching. Facebook drives revenue by up-selling and cross-selling to a client [an advertisement placement]. That is all software-driven. In your office, It used to be that a printer would let you know when you are low on toner. But now it just sends a message to the vendor. You will not even know when you are low on toner. Think about other areas of technology. Why is your car telling you it needs service? Why doesn’t it just message the service center? \nThat removal of human effort is good business. His firm’s slogan is “tools are for fools,” meaning the software packages that for years were installed in companies. “The tool mentality is gone, customers are sick and tired of tools,” he says. \n“They have thousands of them and they’re sort of staring at them saying what the hell is this?” \nAs a result, rather than numerous packages, “there are going to be just a few platforms.” \nThat means ServiceNow, obviously, as one of the platforms. We talked a bit about the quarter and how the business is going. “One of the key things that we tried to highlight in our call,” says Slootman, “is that our platform strategy is really kicking in.” That’s because we set up new platform services at incredible speed. Our ability to invade new territories is on full display. We just turn on a new service, and our customer base doesn’t need a whole new stack, the way it used to be in software. The new service leverages all the notifications, all the workflow, all the messaging that’s in place already. That’s working really well for us. We laid out a target for the capital markets where we said we will hit $4 billion [in revenue] by 2020. That gets us out of the quarterly thing. \nI asked if there was any discussion with his clients about whether processes should be running in Amazon.com ’s ( AMZN ) AWS , or Microsoft ’s ( MSFT ) Azure , or other cloud providers. \nNot really, he says, it isn’t that important. “I have conversations with peers that suck up to the big cloud companies, and I can never understand why they do it. None of our customers ask us about that.” \n“They don’t how we deliver the service, as long as we deliver it.” \nSlootman predicts “You’re gonna have a small number of platforms,” like AWS and Azure, and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google ’s Cloud Compute Platform . But also “front office” software, and back-office applications from Oracle ( ORCL ) and SAP ( SAP ) “and a few more.” \nIn this massive shift to automation, is ServiceNow hiring? Slootman said “we are trying to drive more scale, to be a showcase for our customers,” which sounds like he’s just as mindful of holding down headcount in his own company. \n“We bring clients into our executive briefing center, we show them our HR experience, for example. Our HR is a cloud [via Workday], not a department.” \n“We show them how we curate a catalog for legal services, or all the other services employees may need.” \nI also asked how all this effects things such as policy — the push to have “ STEM ” graduates capable of getting jobs in this country, the policy changes suggested for the H1-B visa program. And how should we feel about a future of work without any human IT jobs? \nSlootman corrected me, saying that it’s not as dire as all that. In fact, “there’s going to be lots of people on the perimeter, defining structure [for cloud] and such, as opposed to being inside the cloud.” \nAs a result, “there are going to be very high-value jobs for people who know how to go and build and design clouds, and take care of them.” \n“Demand for labor will go up. Now, certainly, it’s a big change, something we have to come to terms with in society.” \nBut, he observed with a bit of a laugh, “It’s been going on for fifty years now!” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:22:44.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
