CLARY/AFP/Getty Images) 5452501 \nAmazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos said he is going to explore “other legal options” in response to President Donald Trump’s immigration ban. \n“This executive order is one we do not support. Our public policy team in D.C. has reached out to senior administration officials to make our opposition clear,” Bezos said in a statement, according to The Verge, adding the company has contacted congressional leaders for legislative options. \n“Our legal team has prepared a declaration of support for the Washington State Attorney General who will be filing suit against the order. We are working other legal options as well,” Bezos continued. \nIt is not quite clear what Bezos exactly means by “other legal options.” \nBezos went on to describe how America is full of immigrants and that such “diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view” create a “distinctive competitive advantage for our company.” \nHe also ensured his employees in America and elsewhere that Amazon will use its resources to help, without specifically saying how. \nAmazon officially filed 6,395 “labor condition applications” for H1B visas, and 3,076 “labor certifications” for a green card from fiscal year 2014 to 2016, which makes it ranked 17 among all visa sponsors, according to Myvisajobs.com \nLike Bezos, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is one of the several magnates who agreed to be part of Trump’s business advisory group.

It’s the magic of living in America that people are free to disagree,” Kalanick previously wrote in the email, which he later published on Facebook. \nBezos made no reference to his position on the advisory team, and seems to have received way less public criticism than Kalanick for his relationship with Trump.
