Samsung's MWC livestream might also bring a surprise: we don't expect to see the Galaxy S8 just yet (the next big flagship phone will be announced at a separate event in a month or so), but some news around wearables and / or software are not out of the picture. As usual expect a grandiose event by Samsung, a company known to book the largest audiotoriums and impress with its presentation. Well, at least when things don't get all weird as they did in the distant past.
