Merfeld, Ph.D., a professor of otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School. However, other aspects of vision and sensory function tend to hold strong until the 60s. “If one compares it to other sensory systems, it does seem a bit low, and that was a little bit of a surprise,” Merfeld says. \nNevertheless, John Jeka, Ph.D., professor and chair of kinesiology at Temple University, who was not involved in the study, doubts that middle-aged people with early vestibular aging would notice these deficits in everyday life. However, you might if you’re doing some kind of high-performance sport. \nConsider the career span of pro athletes. “They’re lucky to get into their late 30s, and very few pro athletes can still compete in their 40s,” says Jeka. “There are lots of factors that contribute to that—you lose muscle strength…but I would argue you’re also seeing a degradation of sensory processing.” Vestibular function is part of that. \nBy your 60s, vestibular dysfunction could become obvious in everyday life, Jeka says. For example, you might have to really concentrate to keep your balance when you walk across uneven surfaces such as grass or sand. \nThere’s no standard test to help you assess your vestibular function. However, a physical therapist can gauge it with some simple tests. In one, a patient shakes his head side to side while reading an eye chart. If his vision when shaking is much worse than his sight with a still head, a vestibular disorder could be the culprit, says Susan Whitney, DPT, Ph.D., co-director and professor in the physical therapy post-professional MS Program at the University of Pittsburgh. \nRegular exercise and balance-enhancing activities like yoga and tai chi can help you preserve your vestibular function, she says.
