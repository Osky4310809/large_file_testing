Australia can fall from the top pedestal but to make it happen, Pakistan will have to win by 4-1 or better.\nHowever, considering that Australia leads Pakistan 33-16 on a head-to-head in its backyard, including 15 wins in 19 ODIs this decade, this looks highly improbable.\nThe ODI team rankings, unlike the Test rankings, are updated after each match and the ODI predictor function is available here.\nHost England and the seven highest-ranked sides on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings as on 30 September 2017 will qualify directly for the event proper to be held from May 30 to July 15, 2019.\nThe four bottom-ranked sides will be joined by six teams from the ICC World Cricket League in the 10-team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018 and the top two sides will complete the 10-team World Cup line-up.\nMeanwhile, third-ranked India takes on fifth-ranked England in a three-ODI series starting in Pune on Sunday, January 15. While India will be aiming to narrow the gap with second-ranked South Africa, England will be targeting an upward movement.\nIndia can rise to as high as 114 points if it sweeps the series, but if the series result is reversed, then England can move up one place to fourth and India can slide to fifth.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T12:42:50.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
