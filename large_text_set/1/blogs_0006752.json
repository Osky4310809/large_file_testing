Following his nomination as secretary of state, he retired from his positions as CEO and chairman three months earlier than planned, on Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nThe company has denied climate advocates' accusations. Exxon has said that it accepts the mainstream scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming, and that \"the risk warrants action,\" according to Exxon's website .\nSierra Club, another environmental group involved in Wednesday's demonstrations, said Tillerson's long track record in the oil and gas business should should tarnish his reputation, not bolster it.\n\"At a time when the climate crisis is deepening, both the United States and the world deserve much better than having a fossil fuel tycoon run U.S. foreign policy,\" Michael Brune, Sierra Club's executive director, said in a statement .\nBONUS: Gov.
