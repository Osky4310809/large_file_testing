Defee is indeed particularly jacked â€” and his yolked-ness was amply displayed each time ESPN cameras zeroed in on him while he explained a call on the field.\nThe peanut gallery on Twitter , of course, had a field day with a ref who looked like he could still blow up a running play in the backfield.\nwhen every day is arm day pic.twitter.com/V9i7kACi1l\nâ€” ESPN CollegeFootball (@ESPNCFB) January 10, 2017\nJacked ref alert. #NationalChampionship #oldmanstrength pic.twitter.com/0lXisE9wnd\nâ€” Darrell Romuld (CTV) (@CTVDarrell) January 10, 2017\nMe: \"everyone is tweeting about that buff ref\"\nMom: \"...he's hot\" #NationalChampionship\nâ€” Leslie Ann (@leslie_hudgeons) January 10, 2017\nAnybody gives the Ref any lip tonight during the game, he might go Ultimate Warrior on them.
