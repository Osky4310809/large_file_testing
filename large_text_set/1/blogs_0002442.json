Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWhen Jose Mourinho was asked to name an XI of the best players he's managed over his long, successful career he gave a very Jose Mourinho answer. Or rather no answer. \n\"It’s an answer that I’ve always refused to give and will continue to,\" he told an interview with the FIFA website. \n\"So many players gave their blood and soul when they played for me, how can I name some and forget others?\" \nFair enough, then, but where's the fun in that? \"Nope, not doing it\" (Photo: Reuters) \nNo, it is far better to squabble and argue over these things until everyone is blue in the face, and we're more than happy to give you the opportunity to do that. \nSo, here it is. The best XI that Jose Mourinho has managed. \nFeel free to disagree. Goalkeeper: Petr Cech Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Mourinho's reliable Chelsea stopper (Photo: AFP/Getty) Right-back: Javier Zanetti What a player the Inter stalwart was, and he could play anywhere!
