To allow work to proceed on Tottenham’s new 61,000-seat ground, White Hart Lane is currently operating at a reduced capacity of about 31,500. \nTottenham held talks with the FA, broadcasters and their local Safety Advisory Group , which comprises representatives from police, fire brigade, council and the club itself. After these talks, they settled on a figure of 2,800 – but Millwall chief executive Steve Kavanagh has asked for about 4,000 for the last-eight tie, to be shown live on BBC One on March 12. \nKavanagh argues that the higher number will reduce the risk of Millwall supporters trying to buy tickets in the home sections of the ground. FA confirm early Sunday kick-off for Spurs vs Millwall \nHe said: “The initial number is just over 2,800. But we’re aware that Wycombe received 4,000 [in the fourth round] and Aston Villa were offered 4,000 [in the third round]. We think we should get the same allocation as those clubs.” \n“To me, it wouldn’t be safe to not offer that number. It’s easier to control and manage fans within the confine of the grounds rather than having Millwall fans trying to buy tickets in the Tottenham end. We want Millwall fans in an area together where they can enjoy the game in a safe environment. \n“They’ve given us their initial thoughts based on what their Safety Advisory Group believe the allocation should be. We have challenged that and requested more. \n“I want to get as many Millwall fans in there as possible, as it is a huge game for the club. It’s only right that our fans are given a fair chance to get a ticket.” In Pictures | Tottenham train ahead of Gent clash | 22/02/2017 In Pictures | Tottenham train ahead of Gent clash | 22/02/2017 1/15", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:10:38.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
