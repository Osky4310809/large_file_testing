(Craig Clary / BSMG) Jeff Seidel For The Baltimore Sun The Lions and Gaels continued their dominance at the IAAM/MIAA meet Friday night. \nThe Maryvale girls just keep rolling — another season, another championship. \nThe Lions swept the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland A Conference titles in cross country plus the indoor and outdoor track crowns in 2015-16, and repeated the first two-thirds of that feat after capturing the indoor title meet at the Prince George's Sports & Learning Complex on Friday night. \nMaryvale won the A Conference title with 171 points, beating out McDonogh (136). Glenelg Country took first place in the B Conference with 123 points. \nFor the boys, Mount Saint Joseph, which has won the previous two cross country titles, beat defending champion Gilman, 120.33-113, for the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association crown, the third straight season the Gaels have won a conference title, dating to outdoor track last spring. \nThere was not a B Conference competition for boys in this meet. \nMaryvale used the formula it has relied on during its strong run over the past few years — getting plenty of points from a lot of places to pull away early en route to another championship. The City girls battled through injuries to turn in a strong performance and win the Baltimore City indoor track title for the first time in school history in the championship meet at the Fifth Regiment Armory on Wednesday night. (Jeff Seidel) \nThat helped coach Jason Miller feel better as he's been battling the flu for the past few days. The Lions also battled through injuries of their own. \n\"It's been next-man-up because we have a couple of injuries, but the girls are just running through things,\" he said. \"The [feeling] of this is just indescribable.\" \nMaryvale started the meet by winning the 3,200-meter relay in 10 minutes, 9 seconds. The Lions also took first in the 800 relay (1:47.84). \nIn individual events, Paige Adams won the 55 hurdles (8.84) and the high jump (5 feet). Emily Craig finished second in the 1,600 and also ran on the victorious 3,200 relay team before winning the 3,200 in 11:44.54. (Craig Clary) \nAlex Martinez added a second-place finish in the long jump. In the high jump that Adams won for the Lions, teammates Tara Coyne and Sydney King took second and third, respectively. \nThe Gaels also showed their versatility on the boys' side, taking an early lead before holding off a late Gilman rally. \n\"We made a few mistakes in the beginning of the meet,\" Mount Saint Joseph coach Jack Peach said. \"We then kind of had a second wave.\" \nThe Gaels won the 800 relay (1:33:09) and also got individual wins from Todd Barnes in the 55 hurdles (7.84) and Christian Carter in the shot put (49-0.5). \nIkenna Obi finished second for the Gaels in the high jump, and Hunter Petrik finished third in the 1,600. Dallas Ector's late victory in the pole vault (12-3) gave Mount Saint Joseph a big lift. \nFor Gilman, Ayende Watson won the high (22-5), long (6-2) and triple (45-4) jumps. He also took fourth in the 55 hurdles to give Gilman 35 points. \nThe Greyhounds also won the 3,200 relay (8:12.73) while Tory Young captured the 500 in 1:06.51. Gilman set a meet record (3:26.79) by winning the 1,600 relay at meet's end. \nDalton Hengst of McDonogh continued his strong year with victories in the 800 (1:59.01), 1,600 (4:23.46) and 3,200 (9:36.82), the second straight year he's pulled off that feat. \nHengst finished the 3,000 in 8:28.5 in a meet at Yale last Saturday, taking on the top runners in the Northeast. Longtime McDonogh coach Jeff Sanborn said that time is believed to be the fastest ever in in state history — even topping one from recent Olympic gold medalist Matt Centrowitz (Broadneck) during his high school days. \n\"It's been a great week,\" Hengst said. \"I'm really happy to come out here and run well.\" \nSamantha Facius of Mount de Sales also turned in a strong effort. She won the 800 (2:21.19) plus the 1,600 (5:14.14), beating out Craig both times.
