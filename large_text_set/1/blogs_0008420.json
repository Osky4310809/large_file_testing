But this man treats them as his mom, helping them push the carts.\nWhen we see a stray dog, we might give him a peek, or would take a photo of him. This man, shares half of his food with him.\nWhen we see an elderly neighbor, we silently pass by. This man, silently passes by, after leaving bananas for her.\nThis man gives half of his money to beggars when he’s poor himself. Why?\nHe helps all the people around him without asking for return, which in many people’s eyes, is hard to understand. Why?\nPeople think he’s insane, or just stupid. But one day when the little beggar girl returns wearing school uniform and smiling at him, everyone is shocked, in a happy way. And they finally understand why the man does so much for others.\nAs the video says, what he does receive are emotions, it’s what money can’t buy.\nNever underestimate your power. What you do for others can really make a huge change in their lives.\nThe post Poor Man Gives Money To Beggars Every Day, One Day People Finally Understand Why appeared first on Lifehack .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T12:21:56.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
