He said, “When a ruling party in a state has not even one member from a substantial minority, that to my mind is injustice.” Tharoor, also a former diplomat who is currently serving as a Congress Member of Parliament (MP), added that the minority community represents 20% of the population of the state, and that means whatever the ideology BJP may have, this act shows it does not have a right to claim as meaningful a win as it is at the moment doing in Uttar Pradesh. \nYou May Also Like To Watch This: \nStating it as a very big problem for the party and its government at the Centre, Tharoor took a dig at PM Narendra Modi by saying that when the Centre speaks about ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’, in that case they have to take everyone together and clearly in UP that has not happened. “And it is very clear that the ruling party is not putting up the voice of the substantial minority, that is the first injustice for me,” he said. \nYou May Also Like To Watch This: \nThe BJP has today won a major victory at the hustings in UP by snatching the government from Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav by winning as many as 325 seats in a 403 member legislative assembly and is all set to form its own government there. PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah have thereby again proved that they are still a very powerful combination in electoral politics even though their reputation was dented after the bad defeat in Bihar to Nitish Kumar led Janata Dal (U) and Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s RJD.
