We all know the late, great Scott Weiland can never be replaced. We also are all aware of the sound he brought to this group. With that said, Scott Stapp brings new life to this band and with that, he puts himself back out there fronting a band. Stapp's lyrics have always been real and raw and that does not seem to change here. The guitar sounds of Bumblefoot are what we have come to expect from him as well as the bass playing of Moyer. I am looking forward to the release of this entire album. The first two releases from it leave me wanting more. Welcome Back Scott and AOA! by lilrockable I was bummed when Scott Weiland didn't want to be in AoA. I was even more bummed when he died.

Safe to say, destiny wants me to pay attention to AoA, and considering what a mess Stapp was in 2014 I'm glad they can both move forward. The only thing I'm not too crazy of is how short the album is, even Somber was almost 6 minutes in its original version. Regardless, I can already tell this will be my album of 2017. Best New Group of 20017 Love this Band , can't wait for the rest!!

The idea for the group began percolating in 2011, with producer/guitarist Bumblefoot recording studio sessions in the downtime between GNR shows. In 2014, the band sought out Stone Temple Pilots/Velvet Revolver...
