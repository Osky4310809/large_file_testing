Below are a couple of highlights: Reports that he and Matt have signed short-term deals with Ring of Honor: \n\"We do, it's a short term deal and it's cool because we can still work the indies like we've been doing. We've really had a good time on the independent circuit. We sell a lot of merchandise and take a lot of pictures with fans. It's great to be your own boss and being able to do TV with Ring of Honor as well.\" See Also Jeff Hardy On Ending His Career Against The Undertaker In WWE \nReturning to WWE, his desire to be World Champion again and wanting to bring the Broken Universe to WWE: \n\"I would love to introduce the Broken Universe to WWE eventually. I think it would be huge. As far as character driven or just a fresh vibe in in the pro wrestling world, yeah I think eventually I'm sure I'm going to jump back into the solo dimension and I'd love to be the world champion again. In my career in WWE, if it works out, the whole Hall of Fame and all that stuff. It started there and I'd like to end there. For now, I'm just having a blast doing the indies and I love the Broken Universe stuff with Matt, I think it's the best thing he's ever done. It's just hard to keep a straight face around him at times, but he can be serious and make sense in a weird way, it's just so fun. I hope it lasts as long as it can.\" \nHardy also discussed Impact Wrestling blocking the Hardys from using the Broken gimmick at the ROH 15th Anniversary pay-per-view, probably still being with Impact if Billy Corgan was in control and more.
