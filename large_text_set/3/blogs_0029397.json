The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Credit: Daniel Leal-Olivas/ AFP \nC harlie Mayhew, chief executive of Tusk, said: “This report provides real evidence that many dealers know that their industry is complicit in the sale of illegal ivory and consumers are being misled. \n“As long as the government allows the British ivory market to flourish in its current form - with modern ivory passed off as old -there will be a direct link from sale rooms and stall-holders to African savanna, with the market encouraged by traders leading to the killing of even more elephants. \n“Britain’s intransigence on tightening up the law on trade is undermining its claim that it is still at the forefront of international efforts to end the illegal wildlife trade.” \nMaria Mossman, founder of Action for Elephants, said: “This report presents disturbing evidence that some parts of the antiques trade are concealing a covert trade in illegal ivory. \n“As long as a legal trade exists there will also be an illegal trade - this is simply the law of market dynamics and applies to any regulated commodity. \n“Traders know this, yet, for purely mercenary motives, refuse to acknowledge their part in perpetuating the poaching. \n“Other countries are taking the lead. Against the odds, we have seen China bring in a ban on its domestic trade and the US bring in a near-total ban. \n“Until the UK follows suit with a full ban, and fulfils the pledge it made in the last two election manifestos, it will remain a pariah, not a leader, in the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade.” \nA spokesman for Defra said: “We are committed to bringing an end to elephant poaching and we will shortly be consulting on our plans for an ivory ban. “We are doing more than ever to tackle the illegal wildlife trade, including investing £26m to combat poaching on the frontline and bring an end to this cruel trade.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:18:51.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
