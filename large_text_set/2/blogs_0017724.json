While they were praised aplenty for the fabulous recreation of the song, Saroj Khan seemed a little upset because they didn’t ask her for permission before the same. She came out and made her displeasure known. Upon hearing this, Varun apologised to her. \nThis made Saroj Khan very happy and she took to Twitter to share her feelings. Varun is a wonderful boy, same like his father David Ji. I wish him all the best. @PinkvillaHindi @aliaa08 @ShashankKhaitan @Varun_dvn \n— Saroj Khan (@sarojkhanji) February 17, 2017 \nAnd Varun replied saying this. Thank you ma'am. Lots of love and thank you for the blessing @sarojkhanji #legend https://t.co/Y551OwbLLM \n— Varun Badri Dhawan (@Varun_dvn) February 18, 2017 \nAww!
