It also imposed a 120-ban on the refugee program. \nThe Khans are from Pakistan, however, which is not one of the seven countries included on Trump’s list. \nThe link referencing Khan was to an interview with him in the New Yorker about the executive order, which he said was \"un-American.\" \n“It’s against the safety of my country. I say to President Trump and his security advisers, the drafters of these executive orders, to get out of the White House and go to Arlington Cemetery and stand in front of all the tombstones and learn from observation that Muslims, and people from all other faiths, have given their lives to protect the Constitution and values of pluralism and equal protection,” he said. \nShe also linked to an op-ed in The New York Times about an Iraqi interpreter who, after helping the Marines, will no longer be able to come to the U.S. after a six-year vetting process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:50:49.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
