Sportswriter Cristian Nyari couldn't believe it: Cristian Nyari @Cnyari 3/29/2017, 8:22:26 PM The former Bayern Munich and Manchester United star was confused by the question before the reporterâ€• with a little help â€•changed the subject to an MLS Cup. The 32-year-old wouldn't guarantee any trophies, however. As one might expect, the question led to plenty of hilarity among football fans on social media. Goal weighed in on the matter: Goal @goal Bastian Schweinsteiger asked by a reporter at his Chicago Fire unveiling whether he can win the World Cup with them ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/OKzsF17oO6 Grant Wahl of Sports Illustrated had a theory: Grant Wahl @GrantWahl Convinced that the Ronaldo sculptor & Schweini questioners were the same guy, a master plan to get us through a day without soccer on TV. 3/29/2017, 9:15:43 PM Schweinsteiger is a World Cup winner, as he was part of the German team that took the title in Brazil in 2014. He also added two third-place medals to his impressive resume in 2006 and 2010. At Bayern, he won eight Bundesliga titles and one UEFA Champions League, too. Fire fans can only hope he will bring that same level of success to the Windy City, as the team hasn't won an MLS Cup since 1998.
