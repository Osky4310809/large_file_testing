It seems he will remain in the role. ICYMI: #Rams expected to retain special teams coach John Fassel. He served as interim HC after Jeff Fisher was fired \n— Vincent Bonsignore (@DailyNewsVinny) January 13, 2017 \nHere’s what Fassel said to the media when he was about staying in that role after becoming an interim head coach on December 13: \n“I can’t say, honestly, that the last five, six, eight years as a special teams coordinator I was coordinating special teams to become the head coach. I can’t say that that was an aspiration. I wanted to be a great special teams coach, and if that’s all I did for the rest of my career, I’d be super happy doing that.” \nThe Rams do have one of the most impressive special teams units in the NFL. \nFassel is beloved by his players, including star punter Johnny Hekker — who had an interesting tweet about his coach when he heard rumors Fassel would return.
