Hezel, and other Peggy sofa owners, complained of serious quality issues. Many consumers said the company offered them repair kits when they complained.\nWest Elm said customers with Peggy Collection related issues should contact the special support number (888) 922-7870 or email support@westelm.com .\n2.\nWest Elm Has Pulled The “Peggy” Couch After Viral Essay Said It “Sucks So Much”\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10577252", "external_links": ["https://theawl.com/why-does-this-one-couch-from-west-elm-suck-so-much-2fd9e4c7ce77#.hxhijtu1m", "https://www.facebook.com/WestElmMENA/photos/a.543944542310066.1073741829.542417339129453/781083391929512/?type=3&permPage=1"], "published": "2017-02-23T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:51:04.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
