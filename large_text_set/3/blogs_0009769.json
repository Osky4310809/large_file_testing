In the above brief video on Instagram, he showed off metallic silver packaging with one (huge) word: Glitter. \nBased on the size of the packaging, we're under the impression that it's the cover of a huge palette stuffed with sparkles. However, one never knows . . . Blandino disclosed to WWD in 2016 that he planned to reimagine glitter in 2018 with a latex-like liquid liner that's easy to remove. Getting that formula in time for music festival season would be absolutely clutch! Stay tuned for more updates on this mysterious launch as they become available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:56:58.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
