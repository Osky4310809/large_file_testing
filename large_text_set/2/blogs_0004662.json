Uhm Ki Joon can be seen concentrating as the fencers coach him, and he is completely serious during rehearsals. Unlike Cha Min Ho, who gets scared just looking at the tip of a fencing sword because he has a fear of needles, the actor can be scene roaming the set with excitement written all over his face. \nThe staff stated, “He’s an actor who is always prepared, and when he appears on set, he roams around and brightens the atmosphere. Though he’s the bad guy in the drama, he’s actually a kindhearted actor who supports and watches over the cast and crew.” \nThey continued to add, “Once the cameras start rolling, he focuses on his acting and perfects every scene with subtlety. Though he’s a character who’s easy to hate, we think viewers are drawn to Cha Min Ho because of Uhm Ki Joon’s charm. From episode 5, we will begin exploring why Cha Min Ho has deviated so much from the right path, so please anticipate it.” \n“Defendant” is currently dominating its Monday-Tuesday time slot, hitting nationwide ratings of 20.8 percent in episode 4, and peaking at 22.8 percent in real-time ratings. \nCheck out “Defendant” below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T17:29:57.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
