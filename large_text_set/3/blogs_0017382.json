Martinez made it 2-0 in the 60th minute off a deft flick from Miguel Almiron, and added his second goal in the 82nd, breaking free in the box and sliding in the shot from a tough angle. \nHector Villalba scored in the 67th minute with a booming left-footer after winding up with the ball right at the penalty spot after a deflected shot. Andrea Pirlo dribbles between defenders in New York City's match against the Montreal Impact. \nDominic Oduro's goal midway through the second half lifted the Montreal Impact to a 1-1 draw with New York City FC on Saturday. \nOduro slid behind the defense and had a soft touch as he chested down a long ball from Patrice Bernier. He turned and beat NYCFC keeper Sean Johnson to the ball and chipped it into the net for his first goal of the season. \nOduro had four of the five shots the Impact put on Johnson's goal. \nRodney Wallace scored his second goal of the season late in the first half to put NYCFC on top before the break. He pounced on a rebound after Montreal keeper Evan Bush made a save on Alexander Ring. Wallace got his left foot on the ball and slid it just inside the left post past the sliding Bush. \nThe teams combined for 31 shots but put only nine on goal. NYCFC had more opportunities among its 18 shots but only had one shot on target in the second half after forcing Bush to make three saves in the first. Toronto FC finally found their scoring touch late on against Vancouver, grinding out a 2-0 win on the road. \nToronto FC scored two late goals to beat 10-man Vancouver Whitecaps 2-0 after Brek Shea was sent off in the 70th minute. \nShea was shown yellow for a hard foul on Toronto's Nick Hagglund in the 70th minute and then given a second yellow for dissent to the referee leaving his team down a man with 20 minutes to play. \nAnd the visitors took full advantage, with Victor Vazquez heading home from a Jozy Altidore assist in the 76th minute. \nAltidore would then double Toronto's lead four minutes later, firing home a right-footed shot after a nice spin move at the top of the penalty area following a pass from Jonathan Osorio. \nIt was the first win of the season for the 2016 MLS Cup runners-up, who had played to draws in two matches to start the 2017 campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:15:20.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
