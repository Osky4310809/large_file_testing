(c) Damian Corrigan • Which is Better, Madrid or Barcelona?: Food \nCatalan cuisine is well respected throughout Spain. Not far from the touristy areas of Barcelona you'll find some great food , but it takes more effort than in Madrid, and you'll always end up paying more. I'd recommend a good tour company, such as Food Lovers Company , to ensure you're not disappointed. \nEating out in Madrid is less difficult.

But in 2011, Madrid council unveiled Madrid Rio , a new complex by the Manzanares river publicised as having its own beach, but it doesn't really - just a place to sunbathe (the Retiro park as just as good for this). But if you want a real beach, you need a coast, something Barcelona has. However, Barcelona's beach is horrible and should be avoided.
