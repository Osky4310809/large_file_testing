PUBLISHED: 19:18,   21:36, Sat, Dec 31, 2016 GETTY New evidence indicates Neanderthals could have been cannibals \nResearchers on an expedition in Goyet have found human bones - including those of a child - with signs of cutting and fractures. \nThey believe this confirms our ancestors were cannibals - and the previous inhabitants of the cave broke into the bones to extract marrow. \nArchaeologist Christian Casseyas said: “It is irrefutable, cannibalism was practised here.” Related articles Scientists close to creating LIVING COMPUTER with ‘HUMAN BRAIN’ \nHe said the Neanderthals “broke these bones in the same way that they broke those of the reindeer and horses found at the entrance of the cave, certainly to extract the marrow.” \nFellow researcher Helene Rougier also believes the broken bones indicate cannibalism - as well as Neanderthals creating weapons using the remains of the dead. \nShe said: “Indeed, we can conclude that some Neanderthals died and were eaten here. GETTY Goyet caves have provided key insights into the lives of Neanderthals \n“Some of these bones have also been used to make tools to touch up the edges of flints to re-sharpen them.” \nMs Rougier said there were still many questions left unanswered, despite the discovery. \nShe said: “Was it systematic? Was it only at certain particular moments? \n\"I don't know how to interpret the reason behind this cannibalism. It can be purely food, but it can also be symbolic. The reason remains open.” \nThe bones were dated to a period not long before the Neanderthals were replaced by Homo sapiens. GETTY Bones discovered at Goyet indicate Neanderthals were cannibals \nPrevious discoveries in the Goyet caves have also hinted Neanderthals may have been cannibals. \nResearch earlier this year discovered evidence of bones having been skinned and cut open. GETTY Goyet has been key in discovering more about Neanderthals \nProf Herve Bocherens of the University of Tübingen said: “These indications allow us to assume that the Neanderthals practised cannibalism. \n“The many remains of horses and reindeer found in Goyet were processed the same way.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T02:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:02:11.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
