Instead, you’ll only be able to give a positive or negative response. The move will likely be frowned upon by serious critics, though Roger Ebert was fond of a similar — albeit a little more complex — system.\nNetflix VP of Product Todd Yellin told journalists on Thursday: “We are addicted to the methodology of A/B testing. The result was that thumbs got 200% more ratings than the traditional star-rating feature.”\nThe streaming service is also introducing a new percent-match feature that will give you a “matching” score with any particular movie, like a dating site. For example, a movie closely aligned with the user’s taste may get a 98% match.\nWatch out for both features arriving in the coming months.\nIn other news, Vince Gilligan answers Breaking Bad ’s biggest unanswered questions in Reddit AMA.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T12:56:03.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
