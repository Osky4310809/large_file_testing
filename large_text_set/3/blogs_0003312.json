HTC needs to find an identity. i’m leaning towards the G6. I’m sure most are going with that S8, that phone is going to be a BEAST. Dustin Wood \nI feel phones have sorta hit a plateau. Nothing thrills me right now. Phones keep changing things away from how I want them, so I figured I’d wait out a generation or two to see if they start to go back.

I’m just waiting for them or someone else to create one that’s less fragile, has a great camera, and isn’t $1000 (because of rarity and import costs) B! \nI felt that way about the Note 5 as far as skipping a generation due to no SD card slot.
