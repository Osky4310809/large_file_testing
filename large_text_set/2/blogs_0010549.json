It is housed in a former NCP car park that has already been converted to suit the needs of the wealthy automobile owner. (Source: Google maps) \n\"A car park in central London is being sold for more than entire streets and villages outside the capital’s centre and yet even upper-middle class generations are finding it impossible to rent in London, let alone purchase in their lifetime,\" a spokesman for Waterbridge Estates, which carried out the save, said. \n\"The value of his collection is significantly higher than the price he has paid for the parking.\" \nParking in prime central London is notoriously expensive and difficult, with individual spaces often selling for as much as £350,000. In February 2016 a single parking garage in a back alley in Chelsea sold for £360,000, roughly £2,500 per square foot. \nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T15:52:35.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
