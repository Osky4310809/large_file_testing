Mr. and Mrs. Onwuchekwa and their two-year-old baby were on their way from Lagos to Enugu when their vehicle was blocked and the hoodlums dragged the pregnant woman and her child into the bush and left the husband. \n“We scanned the bush from that morning till about 4:00pm and, as God will have it, we rescued them unhurt and got one of the hoodlums down with the superior fire power of the police and captured another, a Malian. Right now, some of our men are still in the bush to capture their colleagues.” \nNarrating her ordeal, Mrs. Chioma Onwuchekwa, who was rescued with her baby, said they were returning to Enugu from Lagos when the hoodlums’ vehicle overtook and intercepted them around Issele-Uku junction. \nShe said: “They broke the glass of our vehicle and dragged me and my baby into the bush, leaving my husband behind. When they took us to the bush, they didn’t do anything to me, they didn’t hurt or tried to rape me. \n“They took my husband’s number and I gave them also my sister’s number and they were demanding for N30million, but thank God for the police who came and here I am today to the glory of God.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T09:14:16.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
