REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nWASHINGTON (AP) — In his last major act as president, Barack Obama is cutting short the sentences of 330 federal inmates convicted of drug crimes.\nThe move brings Obama's bid to correct what he's called a systematic injustice to a climactic close.\nObama has now commuted the sentences of 1,715 people, more than any other president in U.S. history. During his presidency Obama freed 568 inmates serving life sentences.\nThe final batch of commutations is the most any U.S. president has issued in a single day. It's the culmination of a second-term effort to remedy consequences of decades of onerous sentencing requirements that Obama's said put tens of thousands of drug offenders behind bars for too long.\nObama repeatedly called on Congress to act broadly, but lawmakers never did.\nMore from Associated Press: Rescuers search collapsed buildings in Italy after another powerful earthquake hits region near Perugia Texas Longhorns jump all the way up to No. 11 in latest AP poll after beating Notre Dame A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university's president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure Craig Sager is hoping to return to NBA sidelines by November after receiving a rare third bone-marrow transplant David Ortiz honored with a corn maze cut in his likeness SEE ALSO: Obama commutes WikiLeaks whistleblower Chelsea Manning's sentence — she'll be free in 5 months NOW WATCH: An exercise scientist reveals exactly how long you need to work out to get in great shape Loading video...
