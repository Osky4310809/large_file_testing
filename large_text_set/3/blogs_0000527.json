In two or three days, I'll be back to training again. \n“I remember all until the moment before the collision. I experienced a similar situation with Spain several years ago. I recovered consciousness in the ambulance. I thank all the doctors and hospital staff for their attention. ¡Gran noticia! Fernando @Torres ya tiene el alta médica y ha salido del hospital: https://t.co/lhMJuoRGce pic.twitter.com/AXOsWvbDus — Atlético de Madrid (@Atleti) March 3, 2017 \n“These things happen and the other person involved always is more concerned. I talked with Bergantinos yesterday and it was a fortuitous action. I wish the best to the Deportivo players and fans and I look forward to seeing them in La Liga next season.\" \nAtletico revealed that Deportivo boss Gaizka Garitano and Bergantinos had visited the striker while he recuperated in hospital on Thursday night. \nTorres had come on as a 65th minute-substitute for Kevin Gameiro in the 1-1 result but was unable to fire his side to victory, as Diego Simeone's men languish in fourth - 11 points behind leaders Barcelona and at rish of being overhauled in the final Champions League qualification berth by Real Sociedad.
