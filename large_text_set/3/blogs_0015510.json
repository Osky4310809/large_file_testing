Visitors can wander between over two dozen named gardens and features, including a Himalayan Garden, Aspen Grove, Children's Garden and Meditation Garden. Anderson Japanese Garden | Rockford, Ill. A post shared by Anderson Japanese Gardens (@andersonjapanesegardens) on Nov 1, 2016 at 4:24am PDT \nFounded in 1978, the Anderson Japanese Garden was inspired by the more famous Portland Japanese Garden in Oregon. This authentic Japanese-style garden uses three major elements (stone, water and plants) to create colorful landscapes in all seasons. Other elements, like bridges, pagodas, arbors and stone lanterns, are placed carefully throughout to create a sense of calm and discovery. Lotusland | Santa Barbara, Calif.
