Ryan tweeted about the incident later in the day, remarking, “Just finished swearing-in photos. Nearly 300 members. Countless cute kids. Still don’t get what dabbing is, though.”\nBut the young man’s father, newly elected Kansas Rep. Roger Marshall (R) had the last laugh, tweeting out a link to the dabbing story and writing, “Just so you know @ SpeakerRyan : He’s grounded.”\nJust so you know @SpeakerRyan : He's grounded. https://t.co/PGGhYXEfQv \n— Dr. Roger Marshall (@RogerMarshallMD) January 3, 2017 \n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T17:43:39.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
