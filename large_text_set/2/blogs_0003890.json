While the company did not issue a formal statement, it took to Twitter to respond to individual customers who were disappointed by the decision. \n“It’s not a political decision for us. We decided not to buy the brand for this season based on its sales performance,” wrote Nordstrom. \nThe company did not respond to Investopedia’s request for comment. A Financial Times report quoted a company spokesperson as saying the company offers products from thousands of brands, with nearly 2,000 brands available online. It cuts and refreshes about 10% of these brands every year. \nNordstrom sold apparel and shoes under the Ivanka Trump brand. The website for the company now shows three shoe styles in stock, while the pages for dresses and other apparel do not have any stock available. \nThe retailer has taken flack for months for carrying the Trump line. Calls for a boycott have come from the GrabYourWallet group , encouraging customers to threaten retailers with loss of business unless they end their associations with the Trump family. \nNordstrom has maintained that its business associations should not be interpreted in the political context. On November 2, 2016, in response to a customer the company tweeted “We hope that offering a vendor's products isn't misunderstood as us taking a political position; we're not. We recognize our customers can make choices about what they purchase based on personal views and we'll continue to give them options.” \nMost major retailers have been struggling and Nordstrom is no different. While it saw an increase in sales revenue, the company declared a $10 million net loss for the third quarter of 2016. It recorded a 2.4% increase in comparable store sales for the quarter, but expects the figure to remain flat going forward. \n“I don't think it's any secret that there's been some declines and depending on a lot of reports that you look at, mall traffic is down anywhere 4% to 5% based on a bunch of different reports that we see,” said James F. Nordstrom Jr., Executive Vice President and President, Stores on the third quarter conference call with analysts. \"And that's pretty consistent with how our trends have been. And so what are we doing about that? Well, we are investing a lot in our e-commerce experience and you see the results there.\" (See also: Nordstrom and Peers Fall on Bleak Analyst Comments .)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T12:51:01.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
