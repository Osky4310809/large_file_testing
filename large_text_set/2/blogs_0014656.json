What Causes the Greenhouse Effect? \nLife on earth depends on energy from the sun. About 30 percent of the sunlight that beams toward Earth is deflected by the outer atmosphere and scattered back into space. The rest reaches the planet's surface and is reflected upward again as a type of slow-moving energy called infrared radiation. \nThe heat caused by infrared radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases such as water vapor , carbon dioxide, ozone and methane, which slows its escape from the atmosphere. \nAlthough greenhouse gases make up only about 1 percent of the Earth's atmosphere, they regulate our climate by trapping heat and holding it in a kind of warm-air blanket that surrounds the planet. \nThis phenomenon is what scientists call the greenhouse effect. Without it, scientists estimate that the average temperature on Earth would be colder by approximately 30 degrees Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit), far too cold to sustain most of our current ecosystems. How Do Humans Contribute to the Greenhouse Effect? \nWhile the greenhouse effect is an essential environmental prerequisite for life on Earth, there really can be too much of a good thing. \nThe problems begin when human activities distort and accelerate the natural process by creating more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than are necessary to warm the planet to an ideal temperature. Burning natural gas , coal and oil, including gasoline for automobile engines, raises the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, upsetting a balance between the release and capture of the gas by plants and algae. Some farming practices and other land uses increase the levels of methane and nitrous oxide. Just exposing soils when plowing leads to carbon dioxide release. Many factories produce long-lasting industrial gases that do not occur naturally, yet contribute significantly to the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming that is currently under way. Deforestation also contributes to global warming. Trees use carbon dioxide and give off oxygen in its place, which helps to create the optimal balance of gases in the atmosphere. As more forests are logged for timber or cut down to make way for farming, however, there are fewer trees to perform this critical function. At least some of the damage can be offset when young forests aggressively regrow, capturing tons of carbon. Population growth is another factor in global warming, because as more people use fossil fuels for heat, transportation and manufacturing the levels of greenhouse gases continues to increase. As more farming occurs to feed millions of new people, more greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere. \nUltimately, more greenhouse gases means more infrared radiation trapped and held, which gradually increases the temperature of the Earth's surface , the air in the lower atmosphere, and ocean waters . The Average Global Temperature Is Increasing Quickly \nToday, the increase in the Earth's temperature is increasing with unprecedented speed. To understand just how quickly global warming is accelerating, consider this: \nDuring the entire 20th century , the average global temperature increased by about 0.6 degrees Celsius (slightly more than 1 degree Fahrenheit). \nUsing computer climate models, scientists estimate that by the year 2100 the average global temperature will increase by 1.4 degrees to 5.8 degrees Celsius (approximately 2.5 degrees to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit). \nWhat are the effects of global warming and the greenhouse effect?
