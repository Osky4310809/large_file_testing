It is such a delicate balance. \nAs far as Chelsea boss Antonio Conte is concerned, he came through the other side. He is one of the lucky ones. And he didn't go searching for trouble.

They created their problems - and now they are reaping the whirlwind. \nAfter defeat in the FA Cup at Newcastle, it's seven games without a win for Gianfranco Zola. The worst start by any of the club's managers since 1889. \nQuite what those who pull the financial strings these days at St Andrew's thought they were doing just before Christmas is anyone's guess. \nSacking Gary Rowett - a manager who had lifted the club from the bottom of the Championship to within three points of third place when he was shown the door - was a ridiculous decision at a ridiculous time. It also set a ridiculous benchmark. \nAfter five weeks, several fixtures and a hitherto unremarkable transfer window, it would be right to ask: What, exactly, did those who took the decision expect? Gianfranco Zola has experienced a tricky start to life in charge of Birmingham (Photo: Birmingham Mail) Read More \nSurely they could not be so naive as to think a boss like Zola - a failed manager at two English clubs already - would be able to improve on Rowett's leftovers? \nOh, but they did. But on the evidence of what? \nZola's expansionist football bombed at West Ham and Watford. Did the decision-makers not bother to enquire how he had fared at Upton Park and Vicarage Road? \nAnyone who watched Rowett's crew knew that the sum was greater than its' parts - if beautiful football was their thing, they were keeping it well hidden. \nThere is a reason why these players are employed by middling Championship clubs. If they truly could play, they wouldn't be at Birmingham City. Gianfranco Zola is unveiled as Birmingham City's new manager \nSo, where are we now? \nThe signing of Craig Gardner from West Brom screamed: 'Opportunistic populism,' from the rooftop of the Tilton Road End. \nHe might be one of their own who is honest with an eye for goal but silky smooth feet? Not words you would readily associate with the ex-Villa trainee. \nSo, how does that fit in with Zola's model, exactly? That capture was one for the fans. \nAnd now the club is rushing to sign players to make an impact over the second half of the campaign when sixth place – Zola's minimum – moves further away with each winless week. \nIt's muddled and haphazard. And, generally, unless they are of Zola's quality other foreign imports take time to settle. \nIt could be argued that Zola's opening fixtures were tricky. But then why was this not considered before Rowett was handed his P45? \nThe former boss was punching above his weight. And despite his flirtation with other jobs, he remained in charge. Gary Rowett was a popular manager at Blues (Photo: Nathan Stirk) \nHe knew the players. He knew their strengths and weaknesses. He knew their opponents. \nHe knew what he had to do to to strengthen. \nContrast this with Zola. \nHe knew little, if anything. \nThat's the absolute beauty of the brainless act which has been perpetrated by Birmingham City's owners, Trillion Trophy Asia and de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis. \nA faceless Chinese public limited company that did not even have sufficient courage of its' convictions to send a representative to sit alongside Zola during his unveiling. \nAll they have succeeded in doing is splitting a support-base that has been rock-solid since David Sullivan and David Gold assumed control in '93. Birmingham fans with a message for former manager Gary Rowett (Photo: REUTERS) \nBirmingham City supporters were united. Read the message-boards on fans' sites. They aren't any longer. \nThere are some who cling onto the notion that they will eventually be proved right - that Rowett's departure will end up with the club in a worse position. \nBut which fan takes any enjoyment from that? \nOn the other hand, there is another faction which believes Rowett had taken the club as far as he was able. That another chief will lead them to a brand new dawn. \nAt the moment, darkness still envelops St Andrew's. The promise of daylight is exactly that. \nZola knows he was brought in to lead the club out of the Championship. \nThe way it's going, he'll manage it. But obviously not in the way he wanted. poll loading Will Birmingham achieve promotion to the Premier League with Zola in charge? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T16:33:56.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
