Watch A post shared by Mel B (@officialmelb) on Feb 20, 2017 at 10:10am PST \nShe shared the moment on Instagram with the caption, \"Here is a snippet of me last night doing my last show In @chicagomusical playing Roxie heart breaking character busting out some spice power haha #nyc #broadwaybaby.\" \nShe then posted a throwback during her Scary Spice days, walking into the MTV Europe Music Awards and making a funny face on the red carpet. Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic \n\"Me walking off broadway last night at my last show,\" she wrote alongside the pic. \nSpeaking of the '90s pop group, Mel B recently confirmed to James Corden there will be a Spice Girls reunion in our future in honor of their 20th anniversary (which was last year). Unfortunately, it won't be a complete reunion as Mel C and Victoria Beckham will not be participating. \n\"We are going to do something us three,\" Mel B shared, explaining that Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell will join together as a trio called GEM . \"We're going to perform and celebrate together for the people.\" \nWhen Corden asked why Sporty Spice and Posh Spice are missing the festivities, Mel B joked, \"The other two bitches didn't want to do it!\" She then corrected herself, \"My other two fellow lovely ladies.\" \nThe songstress revealed that they would probably start their tour in London (because they're a British band, duh !), but there was no other details set in stone. \nIn fact, in an interview earlier this month , she said she's still \"trying\" to get it all worked out, especially now that Halliwell is pregnant with her second child. \n\"I'm so down to make this happen, you have no idea,\" Mel B said. \"It's just a case of getting everybody else on the same page...Trying to get everyone's schedule on the same kind of situation is near impossible.\" \nWe certainly hope they can work something out!
