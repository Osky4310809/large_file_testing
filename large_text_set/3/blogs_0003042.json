For the super rich who can actually afford a flight to space, a Chanel uniform is tr√®s essential, non?\nChanel‚Äôs FW17 outing was a mega show, obviously. The set was phenomenal and it even featured a full-on rocket that literally took off (albeit only several meters) at the show‚Äôs climax. When it came to the clothes, Lagerfeld stayed true to his deep space theme, offering plenty of silvery, futurist details like glittery moon boots and his own take on the humble space blanket.\nIs Karl Lagerfeld taking us to the moon? @CHANEL invite. #PFW pic.twitter.com/7hn0jLnAvK \n‚Äî @Booth (@Booth) March 4, 2017 \n\nThe invite sent out to attendees teased Chanel‚Äôs galactic theme well before today‚Äôs show. The invitation featured a neat rocket illustration, and while plenty of showgoers expected to be emotionally transported, we doubt any of them expected to see an actual rocket blast off, IRL, at fashion week.\nAlmost ready to launch #chanelfw17 üöÄ! #matteovoltaphotographer #chanel #parisfashionweek #fw17 \nA post shared by Matteo Volta (@matteovoltaphotographer) on Mar 7, 2017 at 1:19am PST \n\nAs soon as you walked into the iconic Grand Palais, it was impossible to not miss the huge rocket, and it was pretty obvious from that point on that Chanel FW17 was going to be out-of-this-world.\nThe glittery knee boots with patent contrasting toe-tips that accompanied every single look were particularly eye-catching and they went out in a few different colorways. The silver astronaut backpacks in a seriously hulking size proved the oversized trend is going nowhere.\nKarl Lagerfeld also sent out a slew of menswear looks, potentially hinting at the possibility of a dedicated menswear line? The men‚Äôs looks were pretty pared back compared to the womenswear offering at large. For the guys, the palette switched from platinum to shades of ecru and champagne with flashes of white.\n. @Skepta x @RitaOra x @Pharrell front row at the @CHANEL fashion show in Paris üòÖ pic.twitter.com/9am1MqlZCh \n‚Äî Link Up TV (@linkuptv) March 7, 2017 \n\nChanel‚Äôs front row is always studded with stars, and Chanel FW17 featured a coterie of VIP names including Skepta, Pharrell, Future, Cara Delevingne, Lily-Rose Depp, and Rita Ora. The likes of Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Bella Hadid all walked the Chanel space-themed show too.\nChanel are you kidding pic.twitter.com/AdRjT37Ovn \n‚Äî Matthew Schneier (@MatthewSchneier) March 7, 2017 \n\nEven the most blas√© of seasoned fashion editors couldn‚Äôt resist being impressed by such a ridiculous spectacle. Yep, Chanel literally launched a rocket inside of the Grand Palais at fashion week. As the show wound down, the man of the moment, Karl Lagerfeld, and his godson Hudson Kroenig, took to a podium in front of watchful attendees to push the ‚Äúblast off‚Äù button. It triggered a countdown, the rocket made some noise and then proceeded to rise several meters off the ground with Elton John‚Äôs ‚ÄúRocketman‚Äù blaring in the background. Finally, the models emerged to take their final lap and it was all over.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:33:47.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
