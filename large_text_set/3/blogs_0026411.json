Be firm, but nice. 2) Include your name. 3) Tell him why you believe the Convention of States resolution is our last best hope for America. \nUsing the information listed below, please email, call, fax, and text Senator Bell today! \nSenator Mike Bell", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:37:01.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
