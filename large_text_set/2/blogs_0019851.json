The video apparently shows militants driving off in reinforced cars loaded with explosives (Photo: Handout) \nBut it emerged that, despite security services being fully aware of his previous detention, he was able to escape the UK 18 months ago to fight with ISIS in Syria. \nPictures online show al-Britani grinning next to what appears to be wires connected to a red-buttoned detonator. \nISIS said he was one of two militants involved in the attack on a Shiite army outpost. Read More \nIslamic State registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014 when he crossed into Syria from Turkey have recently been discovered. \nThe forms stated he volunteered to be a fighter, saying his knowledge of Islam was basic. \nISIS claimed his attack, during an ongoing battle for control of the city, caused multiple casualties. \nAccording to figures published by the UK government last year, about 850 people regarded as a national security concern have gone to become fighters in the Middle East. \nOf those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 120 are dead. \nTens of thousands of Iraqi forces launched a massive offensive on October 17 to retake the city, which is Iraq's second largest and the only remaining major stronghold of the jihadists in the country. \nThey retook control of the eastern side of Mosul last month. \nIS fighters of a variety of nationalities, including Britons, have carried out suicide attacks on many occasions in Iraq and Syria in the past three years.
