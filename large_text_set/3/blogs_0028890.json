The company is partnering with the Linux Foundation to deliver the program through its eLearning infrastructure. \nThe idea here is to allow both experienced and novice developers demonstrate their open source cloud skills. The program will focus on all of the major public cloud platforms that currently offer Cloud Foundry support, including those from Huawei, IBM, Pivotal, SAP and Swisscom. \nThe $300 exam itself, which should take about four hours to finish, will cover the Cloud Foundry basics, cloud-native application security, application management and container management, and will test developers on their ability to modify simple Java, Node.js and Ruby applications. While this represents a pretty wide swath of topics, developers who can show competency in all of these areas surely won’t have an issue finding a job quickly. \n“Companies need developers with the skills to build and manage cloud -native applications, and developers need jobs,” Cloud Foundry CTO Chip Childers notes   “We pinpointed this growing gap in the industry and recognized our opportunity to give both developers and enterprises what they need.” \nThe launch of this program doesn’t necessarily come as a major surprise. Childers already told us this was in the works last November . \nThe program is currently in its beta phase and will become generally available on June 13 (not coincidentally, that’s also the first day of the Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley and developers will be able to take the test in person at the event).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T10:06:14.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
