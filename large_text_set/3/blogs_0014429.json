Post this revelation, many women have come out either on social media, or written personally to the blogger, about how they were also harassed by Kumar. (Read more about this on our website, here ). \nNow, the number has added up to over 50. Yes, that's right. More than 50 women claim that Arunabh Kumar misbehaved with them. However, none of them have yet taken legal action. This is why Rizwan Siddiqui, a Mumbai based lawyer, took matters in his own hands and filed a third party FIR against Kumar, stating, \"In these kind of cases, not a lot of women want to come forward and take any kind of action because they are so scared and worried about their name and reputation. So, I came forward. The law is very clear that except certain offences, any third party can file an FIR.\" \nNow, we wait for the investigation to begin.
