Is Buffy the Vampire Slayer coming back? (Photo: Studio handout) The cast have been meeting up Sarah teased fans with this pic (Photo: SarahMGellar/Twitter) \nShe then posted a series of images of her and David Boreanaz (Angel) saying “Reunited and it feels so good”, and the cover of the mag thrown in for good measure. \nThe issue, which is out in America on Friday, reunites the hit show's cast and creator Joss Whedon for the first time in over a decade, to celebrate Buffy The Vampire Slayer's 20th anniversary. And it was a surreal experience, according to Whedon. \n“For the most part, this is like a high school reunion but much worse because they all still look really great,\" he told Entertainment Weekly.\" I was hoping some of them would puff out a bit. But that did not take place.\" Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) falls into the loving arms of Angel (David Boreanaz) Video Loading  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T22:32:58.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
