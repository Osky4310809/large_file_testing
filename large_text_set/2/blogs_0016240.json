Millions of people got up, made signs and gathered to make their voice and thoughts heard.\nSEE ALSO: Holiday takes an anti-Trump turn with #NotMyPresidentsDay protests\nOn a little patch of Washington D.C. earth, a similar protest is also quietly underway. Signs have been carefully made, and participants are standing firm.\nThe difference is that the signs here are the size of an index card and the protesters are plastic dinosaurs.\nImage: danny_dire_/twitter\nThe dinosaurs belong to 4-year-old Jackson. The garden protest belongs to the entire family, including mom Andria Wisler and dad Bill Rebeck.\n\"The idea came from a conversation that I had with Andria,\" Rebeck said. \"When I was saying that some completely random people knew about our dinosaur garden.\"\nJackson is the proud curator of the dinosaur garden. Created by a neighbor, Jackson took an immense affinity to the dinosaurs. Rebeck said his son would check on them every couple of days and move them around. Random people passing by also enjoyed looking at the dinosaurs.\nImage: bill rebeck\n\"When I said how well known our dinosaurs had become, Andria said they should use their fame to make their important opinions heard,\" Rebeck shared.\nJackson immediately took to his mom's idea.\n\"He taped the signs onto emery boards and we stuck them in the ground among the dinosaurs,\" Rebeck explained. \"He also had me write a very long discourse on everything he knew about dinosaurs, and he wanted that to go into the garden as well. I told him the large piece of cardboard didn't fit. I think he's forgotten about that now.\"\nImage: andria wisler/twitter\n\"I thought the dinosaurs would be noticed by the people on the street, and a few of them are members of Congress, so that seemed important,\" Rebeck said.\nHe did not seem to expect the immense popularity the garden has gotten due to the fact that a neighbor's tweet about it went viral. But he is glad that it is getting attention.\nsome kids on my block made an anti-trump protest with toy dinosaurs and i'm dying pic.twitter.com/fZKhe6fgqu\nâ€” Dan U (@danny_dire_) February 18, 2017\n\"We can learn a lot from extinct animals,\" Rebeck said.\nThe family does have plans to change the protest slightly in the future. Rebeck spoke about a potential volcano being involved.\nImage: andria wisler/twitter\n\"I think the signs will change, or increase, depending on whether people come up with clever things to write. 'Our Eggs, Our Choice' came from the friend of a student that I know,\" Rebeck said of their plans for the garden.\n\"Actually, I am sure there will be more signs. Dinosaurs care about issues - they need to so that they don't go extinct again.\"\nStay strong and stay woke, dinos. We need as many voices as we can get.\nBONUS: Inauguration crowds are looking puny compared to Women's March crowds", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Jtjfpuk0LXBX6HZjFAkeV0l-Fuk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390415%2Fcfbf896d-eb15-4e4a-9e40-98c5f293731b.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sHhP284P6mawCKcfSn17kBEwoGE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390404%2Ffc1b4314-de39-4c6f-b1ec-79b27d64cce0.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/TaARwiV6.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3-aFhQ--AnZSufznrlDQhDvMGkQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390383%2F37b8ba84-2e8c-4d45-8d57-553199ee608b.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dOFefsnYpYpn98i6StoYo-NHZB8=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390415%2Fcfbf896d-eb15-4e4a-9e40-98c5f293731b.jpg", "https://twitter.com/akwisler", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VoIczcMU0vgDVGZ-LhAqItU2d9o=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390404%2Ffc1b4314-de39-4c6f-b1ec-79b27d64cce0.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B7_1LmqgpGz92c8p_z8Mv9TvlvQ=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390383%2F37b8ba84-2e8c-4d45-8d57-553199ee608b.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/i9ujmmwK7SbS-gCqSsNA1ZSJWd0=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390431%2F98598093-bdb4-4920-91fa-e3a6eb46b430.jpg", "https://t.co/fZKhe6fgqu", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XvQ-vA0Xu0rUs_rXRHPBgMnkeSc=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390431%2F98598093-bdb4-4920-91fa-e3a6eb46b430.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/TaARwiV6.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/danny_dire_/status/833003859865956353"], "published": "2017-02-22T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:48:37.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
