The ban is due to Ms Samoylova performing in Crimea in 2015, a contested territory annexed by Russia.\nRussia has now hit back, with both Russia One and Channel One (who alternate in broadcasting Eurovision in Russia each year) stating that no channel in Russia will broadcast this year’s Eurovision Song Contest shows if Julia is not allowed to compete.\nWhy did Ukraine ban Russia’s Eurovision entrant? \nIn a statement on Facebook, Olena Gitlianska, SBU spokeswoman said:\n‘The Security Service of Ukraine has banned the citizen of the Russian Federation Yulia Samoylova from entering the country for a period of three years. This decision has been taken based on data received about breaking Ukrainian law.”\nRussia announced that Julia Samoylova would represent the country at the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest on Sunday 12 March, just one day before the deadline for entries. The internal selection of former Russian XFactor star, wheelchair-bound since childhood was branded a cynical ploy after the selection of megastars Paulina Gagarina and Sergey Lazarev in the two previous years.\nMany on social media accused Russia of selecting Julia due to her disability in order to avoid the country being booed for a fourth year running. A large LGBT presence at the competition voice their concerns about Russia’s record on LGBT rights and recent anti-gay legislation.\nWhy did Russia pick a Eurovision entrant that broke Ukrainian law? Russia’s selection of Samoylova was also seen as a direct challenge to Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea and the war in East Ukraine – as it was known that Samoylova had previously performed in Crimea.\nDespite this, she was selected in full knowledge that she would almost certainly not be allowed to enter Ukraine, leading many to wonder whether she was being used simply as a pawn in an PR-war between the nations.\nThe 2017 contest is being held in Kiev following Jamala’s victory in Stockholm in 2016 (Picture: AFP/Getty Images) Russia’s latest move had been widely predicted by many people before their artist had been banned, lending weight to accusations of a cynical ploy to withdraw from participating at Eurovision in Ukraine without having to pay a hefty fine.\nRussia has said that if she cannot compete in Ukraine, Samoylova will represent Russia in 2018 instead, giving her the longest Eurovision promotion schedule in history.\nThe European Broadcasting Union, organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest have released a statement confirming the travel ban:\n‘We have to respect the local laws of the host country, however we are deeply disappointed in this decision as we feel it goes against both the spirit of the Contest, and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values. \n‘We will continue a dialogue with the Ukrainian authorities with the aim of ensuring that all artists can perform at the 62nd Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv in May.“\n\nIt is yet to be seen if a compromise can be reached, though it appears that Russia had no intention of participating in Ukraine and is simply trying to score political points and ensure that Samoylova has a full year to campaign for a performance in 2018.\nThe EBU may be able to convince Ukrainian security forces to allow Julia Samoylova to participate at the Eurovision Song Contest in May or Russia may be allowed to select an alternative entry.\nHowever it is most likely at this stage that Russia will now withdraw from the competition, holding Ukraine responsible for their absence.\nMore: Music Wiley, Blossoms and Fatman Scoop added to Bestival 2017 line up \nLiverpool celebrateing50 years of The Beatles' Sgt Pepper with epic three-weekend festival \nTanika Charles soulful voice comes from a very sad place \nEvery so often, Eurovision does get political This is not the first time that diplomatic incidents have entered the world of Eurovision. In 2009, when the Eurovision Song Contest was to be held in Russia, Georgia entered a song called We Don’t Wanna Put In’ – a thinly veiled anti-Putin message shortly after the Russia-Georgia war.\n\nThe Eurovision reference group deemed the lyrics broke the ‘no politics’ rule and invited Georgia to change the lyrics. Georgia withdrew from the competition.\nIn 2012, Armenia withdrew from the Eurovision Song Contest when it was held in Azerbaijan as diplomatic relations between the two countries remain strained. In 2009, Azeri authorities interrogated 42 people that voted for Armenia in the Eurovision televote .\nLast year, Armenia was threatened with disqualification after their singer violated competition rules by waving the regional flag of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region claimed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan, in the Green Room during the Eurovision Song Contest final.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest takes place in the Ukrainian capital Kiev on May 9, 11 and 13.\nMORE: Russia’s surprise Eurovision entry is not going down well with fans \nMORE: Former Eurovision winner Mans Zelmerlow says the UK has ‘no chance’ of victory this year ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T11:46:41.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
