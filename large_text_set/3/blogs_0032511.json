And more often than not, that camera is going to be the one on your beloved smartphone. Now that means if you’re an avid shutterbug or if you just like to share your selfies on social media, you must choose your smartphone carefully. Over the years, brands like OPPO have proved time and again that the camera-centric smartphones are here to stay. The latest addition to its lineup of camera phones is the OPPO F3 Plus , which brings to the table a handful of interesting features for the photographer inside you. Without further ado, let’s have a look at the top five reasons why the OPPO F3 Plus is a worthy buy. Made for multimedia enthusiasts \nThe first thing you’ll notice about the device is how well it’s built. With a slim metallic design and six ultra-fine antenna lines, the F3 Plus is one eye-catching smartphone. Not to mention the slight curved edges on the back, which match the natural curve of your grip. Moreover, the large 6-inch full HD canvas is perfect for multimedia consumption. Be it YouTube or Netflix, the overall experience is much more enriching when using a larger screen. The combination of a crisp display and ergonomic design means watching your favourite shows for long hours shouldn’t be a problem. A treat for selfie lovers \nThe front camera, or rather cameras, are the USP of the device. The dual camera setup at front utilises a 16MP and an 8MP sensor that deliver on the promises made by the company. It is quite quick to lock on the focus and retains ample details even in low-light scenarios. If you’re one person who likes the Beauty mode in cameras, you’ll be delighted to know that the F3 Plus has a very impressive Beauty mode that makes sure you look your best, always. Last but not the least, the setup has a very wide field of view, meaning fitting more people in one selfie shouldn’t be that big a hassle. Impressive camera at the back \nThe fascia is not the only place which boasts an impressive camera. In fact, the 16MP rear camera clicks great stills outdoors in bright lighting conditions and manages to reproduce good results in artificial light too. The colours are natural, and a wide f/1.7 aperture ensures you can get the bokeh effect going for some drool-worthy portraits. OPPO touts its dual PDAF technology for reducing focussing times. The camera app with its minimalist and easy-to-navigate design adds the final touch to a great camera experience. Loaded hardware \nThe F3 Plus is no slouch when it comes to performance. Under the hood, it is powered by a Snapdragon 653 processor which works in tandem with 4 gigs of RAM to ensure a smooth and seamless experience with enhanced multitasking. Don’t forget the front fingerprint sensor which provides both ease of use and a high level of security. Out of the box, the F3 Plus runs Android Marshmallow. Never backs down \nAll that raw power and camera features would go down the drain if the device doesn’t have a powerful battery to back it up. Thankfully, the F3 Plus has an amazing battery life, thanks to its large 4,000mAh battery. The cherry on the top is the inclusion of VOOC Flash Charge technology which not only helps charge your phone faster, but also ensures the battery power isn’t consumed by apps running in the background. \nSo those were five reasons to buy the OPPO F3 Plus. There are tons more, which means the F3 Plus is a deserving candidate for your next phone.
