They don't feel that their sons are safe in your jails. They want all of them released immediately, especially those who have no court rulings issued against them. \n\"They also want to bring to justice all those who killed our sons. Otherwise, we will bring them to justice our way.\" \nThe residents threatened to begin a civil disobedience campaign unless their demands were met within seven days. OPINION: Sinai insurgency - An enduring risk \nEl Arish and Sinai are inhibited by Bedouin tribes whose relationship with central government has been uneasy for years. \nThe tribes complain of lack of development and of being collateral damage in the government war with armed groups and smugglers. \nPolice and security forces are often accused of torturing them to death. Killings of suspects \nThere are growing accusations that the government is killing suspects in detention before claiming they were killed in shootouts. \nAccording to a Human Rights Watch report , the Egyptian government said that its counterterrorism operations in north Sinai killed at least 3,091 \"terrorists\" between January and July 2015. \nThe Arab Organization for Human Rights, a London-based organisation, reported that more than 361 people were killed in Sinai by the Egyptian army in 2014 for allegedly being wanted for terrorist activities. \nNearly 1481 people have been arrested for the same reasons without a shred of evidence or legal due process, it reported. OPINION: Walking into a trap - How I ended up on trial in Egypt \nResidents of the rugged and mountainous region often complain of what they say are heavy-handed tactics used by security forces, including collective punishment following particularly deadly attacks against government forces. \nThe campaign grew more deadly and widespread after the military's 2013 overthrow of Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president. \nSisi, who led Morsi's removal when he was his defence minister, said last week that 25,000 soldiers were deployed in northern Sinai to fight armed groups . \nThe previously undisclosed figure appeared to underline the magnitude of the challenge the military faces.
