The shell of the Skittles will eventually begin to dissolve, and it'll take the food coloring with it. The result, depending on how you arranged your Skittles, should look like the video above, a rainbow of colors coming together but not blending together. \nThe science behind it is pretty simple: water stratification . The sugar content from each candy is roughly the same, so each dissolved bit of sugar acts as a barrier, preventing the fluid from blending together; the food dye just makes this process visible to us. Pretty neat, huh? \nOver time, the colors will begin to blend as the actual candy itself begins to break down and different amounts of ingredients shift the densities of the water. One blogger prepared two more bowls of Skittles and water the night before doing the rainbow dish experiment with her kids, and the results are, well, let's say they're just as scientifically interesting but significantly less pretty than the rainbow dish.
