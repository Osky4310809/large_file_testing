Published in 1945, the short book appears on the Modern Library’s list of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th century, and Time Magazine’s own honors list . But, as Hitchens reminds us, Animal Farm was almost never published. The manuscript barely survived the Nazi bombing of London during World War II, and then initially TS Eliot (an important editor at Faber & Faber) and other publishers rejected the book. It eventually came to see the light of day, but, 65 years later, Animal Farm still can’t be legally read in China, Burma and North Korea, or across large parts of the Islamic world. But, no matter where you come from, you can listen to Animal Farm for free. That’s right, I said it – free . The Internet Archive offers free access to audio versions of Animal Farm and Orwell’s other major classic, 1984 . Both texts appear in our collection of Free Audio Books , and you can download them directly from the Internet Archive here ( Animal Farm ) and here ( 1984 ) . Enjoy. \nNote : Looking for an easy way to download Orwell’s classics , or any other audio book, for free? Just head over to Audible.com and register for a 14-day free trial .
