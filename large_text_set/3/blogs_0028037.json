The pivotal moment in the game came with about a minute left. Gonzaga was trailing by a point, but the Bulldogs turned a blocked shot on defense into a transition, go-ahead three-pointer for Jordan Mathews. The play turned the game on its head. \nCrazy sequence for the Zags pic.twitter.com/XRJJ5Tl3j2 \n— Ryan Kelapire (@RKelapire) March 24, 2017 The sequence started with a missed free throw by West Virginia’s Daxter Miles. Gonzaga rebounded, but West Virginia stole the ball, and the Mountaineers’ Nathan Adrian almost dunked to give his team a three-point lead. Gonzaga’s Josh Perkins ultimately turned away Adrian ’s effort, setting up a break the other way. Nigel Williams-Goss made a pass to Mathews that got tipped but made it to him anyway. When it did, Mathews didn’t miss. The play was a thing of basketball beauty.\nFormer Michigan and NBA star Chris Webber, who was calling the game on TBS, liked what he saw. Webber (we think!) was audibly clapping as the play went the other way after Mathews’ triple. And why not? It’s good to see sports played well. \nThere’s no overstating how pivotal the entire sequence was. Gonzaga was a split-second away from trailing by three. Instead, it was leading by two, and West Virginia didn’t score another point the rest of the game. \nThere was one more key moment to come: a lousy last possession by WVU’s Jevon Carter. But this play, above all, is the one that landed Mark Few’s team in the Elite Eight. The Zags took their hacks from one of the most difficult opponents in college basketball, and this is the play that ensured they’d still be dancing at the end of it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:55:17.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
