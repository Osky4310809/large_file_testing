The bulk, or 92 percent of government revenue came from tax collections. \nThe government’s largest revenue collecting arm, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), collected P147.4 billion in January, 14 percent up from P129.65 billion in the same period last year.   \nThe increase was attributed to higher taxpayer compliance, as well as the reforms implemented by the BIR, such as the expansion of its Large Taxpayers Service. \nEarlier, Internal Revenue Commissioner Caesar Dulay committed to expand its list of large taxpayers from 2,320 to 3,000 to improve the bureau’s tax collection effort. \nLikewise, the Bureau of Customs (BOC) also registered a 16-percent growth in its collections in January 2017. The Bureau collected P35.9 billion as compared to P31.08 billion in the same month in 2016. \n“Same with BIR, the BOC had implemented sweeping reforms to improve their collections for this year,” the BTr said. \nNon-tax revenues, on the other hand, decreased 21 percent to P15.97 billion from P20.33 billion last year. \nThe decreased was slightly cushioned by the BTr’s income, which inched up by one percent to P8 billion due to higher interest on the advances to government-owned and -operated corporations, as well as improvement in the income of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. \n“These compensated for the lower interest income earned on national deposits lodged with the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas),” the BTr said. \nMeanwhile, the national government’s spending in January 2017 also improved by seven percent to P198.1 billion as compared to P185.7 billion in the same period last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:15:02.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
