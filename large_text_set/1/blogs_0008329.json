Hull City's new boss in profile \n“I don’t think it is good for Marco to be compared with me,” said Mourinho. “I don’t think it’s good for him. \n“And I don’t think it’s fair, but I can see a similar start of career, because he was in a small club, Estoril, before he moved to Sporting Lisbon. I was in a small club, Leiria, before I moved to Porto, so we had a similar start in Portugal. \n“He did well and I see him as an intelligent guy with a good attitude. \n“You know, it’s not easy to come to the Premier League when you’re a foreign coach.

They’re bottom of the Premier League, with 13 points, but it’s a big opportunity for him. \n“He’s known in Portugal as one of the good young coaches. He went to Greece, he was champion there, and now he comes to the big one. \n“His formation [as a coach] was good, because he started low. He wasn’t given a top job immediately. \n“He did well in a small club in Portugal, then he goes to Sporting, one of the top three. Then he goes to Greece and is champion with Olympiacos.

In spite of being a young guy, he’s experienced because he’s stable, very mature. \n“I look forward to another Portuguese guy in the Premier League, in this case one from a younger generation than myself. \n“I would love him to do well but we all know that in the Premier League, when you’re bottom, it’s hard to jump, but he’s going to try for sure.” \nMourinho goes into Tuesday night’s game boasting a remarkable record of having never lost a League Cup tie in 90 minutes. As well as winning the trophy three times, Mourinho has suffered two penalty shoot-out defeats and an extra-time loss. \nIt was the first trophy he won in England, with Chelsea in 2005, and he is desperate to get back to Wembley and lift the trophy for a fourth time - his first as United boss.

For big clubs, a competition is a competition. I was never good at choosing competitions. \n“So many times at some of my clubs you get to April and you have a busy fixture list, but you’re in competitions to try to win. Can the Portuguese add another trophy to his collection? (Photo: AFP/Getty) \n“I always felt the League Cup, as a cup, is not the FA Cup, but it’s a cup, it’s the League Cup. When it moved to Wembley, I think the meaning is even better, so why not try? \n“It’s a two-legged competition. If we don’t play well in one leg, you have another match to try, so we’re going to try. I know Marco, he’s an intelligent guy, he will organise his team well for sure, but we want to be there.” \nUnited go into the tie on the back of eight successive wins in all competitions, their best run of form since 2009 under former boss Sir Alex Ferguson, with Mourinho desperate to maintain that momentum. \nHe said: “I think the fact you’re winning matches is good and you’re not going to throw away an opportunity for that.” poll loading Who will win the tie? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:39:08.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
