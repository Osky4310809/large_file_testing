(Because at least Ben Affleck wasn’t around this time to call them “gross and racist.”) \nThe conversation seemed to drag on after a while (at least for me as a viewer) — it also seemed to throw Maher off his game during other parts of his show. And it would’ve been nice to include some progressive Muslims in person (instead of simply mentioning their names). But it was the sort of conversation we don’t hear too often on television because everything in politics is a five-alarm fire these days. \nIf only we could hear more lengthy discussions about beliefs — and the problem with faith-based dogma — instead of just reacting to whatever crazy thing Donald Trump just did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:29:46.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
