Their issues on the hardwood spilled into the media during the 2004 NBA Playoffs and cooler heads still haven’t prevailed. In May 2016, Thomas, 39, openly challenged Martin to a charity boxing match, with an account of him slapping his longtime rival in the face with $1,500 in cash. \nAccording to Fif, “They really need to go ahead and get that shit off their chest,” and he declared the fight to be official. \nExcept, no one relayed the message to Martin. \nWhile attending the press conference for Ice Cube’s BIG3 3-on-3 basketball league, Martin told Billboard , “Don’t be part of the circus, dog.” \n“You know what they say if you entertain clowns, right? If you entertain clowns, you become part of the circus. I’m a 39-year-old grown-ass man, dog. If that was going to happen, I would have took care of it seven years ago. I moved on. I got kids at home. I don’t got time for that. It’s childish. It’s just people reaching for something to talk about. I’m not gonna entertain that.” \nHipHopDX recently spoke to former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner ahead of his next prizefight, who had no problem being “part of the circus,” seeing how he knows both Chris Brown and Soulja Boy personally. And for what it’s worth, he picked Breezy Brown to slump Soulja in the ring (if it should ever happen). \nWatch the 2004 postgame interviews between Martin and Thomas to peep how the b-ball beef first began.
