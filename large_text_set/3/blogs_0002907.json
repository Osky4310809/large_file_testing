After the break, Golden State returned to form, scoring 35 points in the third quarter of its 112-105 victory. \nDraymond Green definitely wasn’t happy with the Knicks’ first-half experiment, telling reporters after the game that it was “disrespectful” and that it ruined the flow of the game. Draymond Green not a fan of the no music first half in MSG, called it \"pathetic.\"\"They need to trash that because that's what that was.\" pic.twitter.com/1g7qqKv2M2 \n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) March 6, 2017 \n“That was pathetic,” Green said. “It was ridiculous. It changed the flow of the game. It changed everything. You get so used to playing the game a certain way. To me I think it was disrespectful to everyone from [NBA executive] Michael Levine and [Warriors president] Rick Welts and all these guys who have done these things to change the game from an entertainment perspective and give the game a great vibe.” \nNeither team played well in the first half, with the Knicks hitting just 18 of 41 shots while the Warriors converted 17 of 47. Green didn’t accuse the Knicks of trying to throw Golden State off its game, instead saying it ruined the overall experience. \n“No, I don’t think they were trying to change us,” Green said. “Because I think it changed their players, too. Did you see that first half? It was just bad, sloppy, all over the place. There was no rhythm to the game. All of that stuff makes a difference, believe it or not. You get rhythm. That’s why when guys go in and work out at night, you turn on music. It helps you get into a certain area, a certain place. I don’t think they were trying to do it to throw us off, but it definitely threw the entire game off.” \nGreen doubled down on his claim of disrespecting the game. \n“Complete disrespect,” Green said. “You advance things in the world to make it better. You don’t go back to what was bad. It’s like computers can do anything for us and then you go back to paper. Why would you do that? It was ridiculous …They need to trash that because that’s exactly what that was.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:09:24.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
