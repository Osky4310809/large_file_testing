People across the Internet spoke in support of the girl, and shared their immense anger and disgust at the actions of the guy in question. Unfortunately, a few days after the article was shared, the parents of the harasser requested the publication in question to hide his identity and remove the post, and the victim agreed. One person who was deeply affected by this girl's story, was actress Ileana D'Cruz. She took to Twitter to express her anger and disgust at the harasser, and even revealed her traumatic past of having been harassed and eve-teased. Read what the actress had to say, here.
