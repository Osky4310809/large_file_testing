But Ryan Murphy and his co-producers are apparently eager to get started the third, far more fashionable (sorry FEMA officials, but it’s true) installment in the true-crime anthology series, which will focus on the murder of world-famous fashion designer Gianni Versace in 1997. \nAnd, befitting a story set in the world of high fashion, there’s already drama on that front: Back in November, we reported that Lady Gaga would be playing Donatella Versace, Gianni’s sister and a flamboyant character in her own right, on the show. Now, producers have apparently decided they want a little less pop-star bling, and a little more European sophistication. In other words, Oscar-winning Spanish actress Penelope Cruz has taken over the role, as reported by Deadline. Cruz will star alongside Édgar Ramírez as Gianni Versace and Glee alum Darren Criss as his killer, Andrew Cunanan. \nAmerican Crime Story: Versace will air sometime after American Crime Story: Katrina, whenever that is. In the meantime, we’ve always got Gina Gershon’s gloriously overwrought version of the character in the 2013 Lifetime movie House Of Versace. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:18:06.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
