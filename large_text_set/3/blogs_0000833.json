She knocked some people down, was rolling around on the ground, knocked a couple tables over, broke a few glasses,” North Huntingdon Police Lt. Rodney Mahinske. \nSarah Jo Reihart, 24, had left the scene before police arrived. However, she returned while officers were speaking with witnesses. One of the officers had Reihart’s purse, which she had previously left behind. \n“She came back and was going past our officers, they tried to stop her and talk to her, and she told them basically where to go,” said Lt. Mahinske. “She continued to the door, beating on the door, screaming, ‘I want my purse back.'” \nReihart noticed the purse with one of the officers, attempted to grab it and allegedly pushed into the officer. The officer then attempted to put Reihart up against the wall, but she resisted, which caused the officer to lose their balance on the stairs. \n“At that time, she continued to resist arrest and allegedly attempted to grab the officer’s holstered gun,” Lt. Mahinske said. “During the incident, Reihart also allegedly elbowed the officer.” \n“She charged one of our officers, attacked one of our officer, and another officer jumped in, grabbed a hold of her. When he grabbed a hold of her she reached for his side arm and tried to pull his side arm out of its holster.” \nEventually, she was placed in handcuffs. However, she allegedly kicked a second officer in the chest and shins while being placed into a police cruiser. \nReihart was said to be highly intoxicated and shouted profanities throughout the incident. \nShe is facing a list of charges including, resisting arrest, simple assault, aggravated assault and public drunkenness. \nShe is currently free on $25,000 cash bond, but no longer allowed in the firemen’s club. \nA preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T08:53:14.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
