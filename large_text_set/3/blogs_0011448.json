Is it even possible for Donald to improve on his last few seasons? It looks like it. A post shared by Aaron Donald (@aarondonald99) on Mar 8, 2017 at 5:52am PST \nEvery offseason during NFL free agency, some players get lost in the shuffle. Fans and media alike fixate on the unrestricted and restricted free agents, and the rest of the players momentarily fade into the background. \nLittle attention is paid to those already under contract who improve in the offseason when the enticing prospect of instantly upgrading the roster is on the table. It’s natural. \nIn three seasons with the Rams, Donald has 28 sacks, 115 solo tackles and four forced fumbles. Put it this way: They are preparing for it as we speak https://t.co/HvIuxjLNjQ \n— Vincent Bonsignore (@DailyNewsVinny) March 10, 2017 \nWith those numbers, Donald could become the top defensive tackle available in free agency next year when his contract expires. Unless of course, the Rams are clearing cap space and doing anything they can to keep Donald in Los Angeles. \nThe Rams have extra cap space after trading William Hayes and dumping Tim Barnes, Eugene Sims and Tre Mason. \nNext season will be the last year of Donald’s rookie contract, in which he’ll make $1,802,250.00 as a base salary, so it’s likely he’ll want a deserved payday after that. \nHopefully, the Rams continue doing anything and everything possible to make sure they’re the ones giving him the paycheck next offseason.
