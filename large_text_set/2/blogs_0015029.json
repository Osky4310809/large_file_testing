Fingerlings are motion and touch sensitive.\nWhile most of the little battery-operated figure is fixed, the toy monkey's head turns and eyes open. That little bit of animation affords the monkey-bots an impressive amount of expression. WowWee told us that there are actually over 40-to-50 distinct animations and sound effects in Fingerlings.\nWith every touch, tap or stroke, the Fingerling monkey responds. It also responds to a blown kiss (really just blowing in its face) and will \"fall asleep\" if you lie the plastic money down in your palm and slowly pet it. To wake it up, you grab it by the tail and swing it back and forth.\nAvailable starting in six different colors (and with six different names), Fingerlings Baby Monkey ships this August for $14.99.\nBONUS: Behold, the Trump mask.", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/7DdgBENJ.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/7DdgBENJ.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/bHknzmaL.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/bHknzmaL.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-21T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:18:10.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
