James Antle III Politics Editor The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Antle-3.jpg More \nThe Trump administration's frenetic pace right out of the gate has confounded Democrats and kept the national press on its toes. \n\"Incredible pace of activity in the Trump White House on week one,\" tweeted ABC News' chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl. \"When have we seen a public sked as packed as yesterday's and today's?\" \nEntering his first full week in office, President Trump has issued executive orders clearing the way for the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, pushing for relief from the costs imposed by Obamacare, reinstating a ban on public funds for international organizations that perform or advocate for abortion, and freezing both new regulations and federal hiring. \nExecutive orders pertaining to immigration , especially the \"extreme vetting\" Trump promised would take place with migrants from selected countries deemed to pose a disproportionate terror risk, are expected to follow Wednesday. He's even reshaped how the White House deals with press, by calling on non-mainstream news outlets first at the daily briefing, leaving wires and major TV networks waiting their turn. \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

More significantly, he started the ball rolling on re-negotiating NAFTA, a North American free trade pact that was conceived by Ronald Reagan, substantially negotiated by George H.W. Bush and has been in effect since Bill Clinton's administration. \n\"We are going to put a lot of people back to work,\" Trump said, according to the pool report. He met with labor union leaders (most of whom endorsed Hillary Clinton last year) and rank-and-file members (many of whom voted for Trump anyway) at the White House, eliciting effusive responses. \n\"It hit home for the people who have been hurting,\" Douglas McCarron, president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. Sean McGarvey, president of North American's Building Trades Unions, was later quoted as describing it as \"by far the best meeting\" he'd had in Washington. \nThese construction unions might be willing to make common cause with Trump on infrastructure spending. House Speaker Paul Ryan is set to carve out space in the budget for an \"expansive\" plan. Also from the Washington Examiner \nThe State Department will review a last-minute $221 million payment the Obama administration approved to the Palestinians, just before President Obama left office. \nThe payment infuriated Republicans, and now the Trump administration is looking into the action. \nThe Associated Press reported that the State Department now wants to be sure the payment \"comports with the Trump administration's priorities.\" \nThe department is still awaiting a new secretary, and Trump's nominee, Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, is expected to be confirmed Monday by the Senate. \nTillerson drew scrutiny from Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., but all three have said they would vote for him. • 01/25/17 8:16 AM \nBusiness leaders had their turn meeting with Trump as well. While the president promised to improve the business climate with fewer regulations and lower taxes, he also reiterated his threat to get tough with companies that move American jobs overseas. The CEOs in attendance seemed to get the message. \nAll this has taken place as the first of Trump's Cabinet picks have been confirmed by the Senate in bipartisan votes. James Mattis was confirmed as secretary of defense by a vote 98-1. John Kelly was approved as secretary of homeland security 88-11. \nEven Mike Pompeo, a conservative Republican congressman from Kansas whose nomination proved more controversial, won 15 Democratic votes on his way to becoming CIA director, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's and 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine . A Supreme Court nominee is coming soon. \nMany rank-and-file Democrats are outraged more hasn't been done to resist Trump. There was big turnout for anti-Trump marches in Washington, D.C. and other major cities over the weekend. Trump lost the popular vote and his current approval ratings are anemic, especially by the standards of a new president. \nLiberal interest groups and lawmakers have weighed in each time Trump has acted on their pet issues.
