She's frequently posting her impressive workouts on Instagram, but her latest sweat session at New York City's The Dogpound gym has us in awe. \nAfter confessing to indulging in a sweet treat the night before, Ashley's trainer is making her sweat it out, but from the smile on her face, we bet that cupcake was worth it! She's running up the block with trainer Dawin Pena pulling her back, as Ashley details the \"chocolate with white frosting\" cupcake and replicates the drool coming down her mouth. OK before we talk about the cupcake, we have to point out that her huge smile and insane strength are applaudable because that workout is no joke.

With sledgehammer tire smashing, slide board lateral exercises, and more beast mode exercises, it's no wonder Ashley's in such incredible shape. Her workout is a sweet reminder that we should enjoy dessert and allow ourselves to indulge in our favorite treats, because it's great fuel for workouts!
