And then we were mystified even more when she changed out of her Jimmy Choo’s and slipped into a comfy pair of Converse to party the night away . But while we were looking at Williams’ dress, hair, purse, shoes, and entire being, we skimmed over a super cute addition to her outfit. Williams wore stellar star stud earrings and solidified her worldwide stardom – say that five times fast!\nPaired with a set of glamorous diamond dangles, her little star studs added a bit of magic to her Old Hollywood look . THANKS ARE WELL OVER DUE @kmannmakeup and @ryanrichman u guys KI ED it. Love u both so much. This weekend was mad fun with u both! xxx \nA photo posted by Maisie Williams (@maisie_williams) on Feb 1, 2017 at 9:31am PST \nThey also remind us that even though the Game of Thrones actress is wearing this mature ensemble, she’s definitely still a regular teenager.

To the Golden Globe Awards, she wore these beautiful, sparkly triangular earrings that she ended up pairing with some classic black hoops.\n#millennial #bringingthefireplaylist #4youreyezonly Hair: @ryanrichman \nA photo posted by Maisie Williams (@maisie_williams) on Jan 8, 2017 at 10:37pm PST \nShe wore a similar combo to the BAFTA TV Tea Party. Always a good laugh at the BAFTA tv tea party.

They’re an understated way to add a little whimsy to any look, whether you’re wearing a gown or just jeans and a tee!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:09:32.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
