A scientist is working on a piece of future technology, before being approached by Rip Hunter. The scientist is working on a neural transplant that can stop - or encourage - violence. Rip shoots the technician in the leg, asking him for the location of the piece of the Spear of Destiny that Rip told him to protect. Rip prepares to cut the guy's leg open, where he thinks the spear is. \nThe Legends use the Waverider to travel to 3000, where they visit the location of the now-dead scientist. It turns out that the scientist was actually Doctor Midnite from the JSA. They find Rip's name written on the floor in his blood. \nBack in the Waverider, the Legends debate their current situation. Amaya believes that Sara should not have let Rip go, since he went on to murder Doctor Midnite. Gideon reports where the next piece of the Spear is - in medieval England. \nRay and Nate suit up in period clothes while debating about their experience with medieval history. \nMick finds Stein in the library. Mick starts to suspect that Stein stole something, and discovers that it's Doctor Midnite's future technology. \nNate, Sara, Amaya, and Ray walk through the forest, where they are attacked by a legion of knights. Ray attempts to pacify them with an old-English accent, and reveals that the knights work for King Arthur. The lead knight pulls off their helmet and announces that she is Guinevere, and promises to lead the group to the king. \nThe group are taken to King Arthur, who is sitting at his round table. King Arthur summons Merlin - who is really Stargirl. \nThe team takes Stargirl onto the Waverider. She explains that Rip accompanied the JSA on a mission to find the Spear of Destiny, and they proceeded to split it into four pieces and guard it across history. Stargirl explains that her piece is fashioned somewhere in King Arthur's court. \nThe three are later at a party in King Arthur's court. Stargirl assures Amaya that the piece of the Spear is well hidden, while Sara compliments Guinevere on her warrior skills. Guinevere explains she is much more comfortable being a warrior than a queen, and explains that her husband is on a hunt at the moment. \nArthur fights with a knight in the forest. Arthur asks the knight to just kill him, but the knight lifts up his face shield, revealing he is Damian Darhk. Darhk and Rip approach Arthur, telling him they have big plans for him. \nBack at the party, Nate, Jax, and Ray have a drink-off. Ray notices Sir Galahad sitting in the Siege Perilous, the seat for the best of the round table. Ray approaches Galahad and tells him he's a big fan of him. Galahad explains why he fights alongside Arthur. \nArthur returns with the Black Knight. Stargirl approaches him, and he holds a knife to her through. Darhk reveals himself as the Black Knight, and also reveals that Arthur is being controlled by Rip using Doctor Midnite's future technology. When Stargirl reveals that she will not give them the spear, the trio get ready to kill Stargirl, but the Legends grab a sword and starts fighting. Arthur kills Galahad and then puts a knife to his own throat. Rip and Darhk threaten that they will return with an army of mind-controlled soldiers if the Legends do not give them a piece of the spear. \nThe next day, Stargirl asks how the Legends know Darhk. Sara discovers the future technology in one of the knight's heads, and Guinevere gets upset, saying that she doesn't want to lead Camelot in this battle. Sara explains that Guinevere will be able to lead, much like she learned to lead the Legends. Amaya suggests to Stargirl that they take the Spear out of the castle, but Stargirl disagrees. \nStein inspects the future tech, only to be discovered by Jax, who is disappointed in him for having stolen the technology. Stein explains that the technology works through transmitters and receivers, but requires an abnormally advanced mind to outsmart Rip and Darhk's current settings. They decide to use Stein and Mick as test subjects. \nBack in the forest, Darhk and Rip threaten King Arthur to lead his soldiers into battle. \nStein and Rory test out the future technology, but with no success. Mick takes off his device. Stein discovers the signal that Rip and Darhk are sending to Mick's device. \nGuinevere gives her army a rousing speech before battle. She receives word that the Legion is quickly approaching, and they decide to settle the battle via swords instead of Stein's technology. The group runs off to battle, and Nate asks Ray if this cause is worth dying for. Ray says yes, because he loved the stories of Camelot as a kid. As Ray walks away, Nate opens his history book and sees a Medieval drawing of Ray being given a soldier's funeral. \nAmaya and Sara discover that the Spear fragment is hidden in Excalibur. Amaya harnesses the power of all of her animals to be able to pull it from the stone. She breaks the sword apart and finds the piece of the spear, but Stargirl runs in and tells them to stop. \nDarhk and Rip argue about the Spear, Rip feeling undermined by the fact that Darhk won't listen to him, despite him having already found two parts of the Spear. \nAmaya discovers that Stargirl is so protective over Camelot and the Spear because she fell in love with Arthur. Amaya tells Stargirl that the Legion of Doom will stop at nothing to get the Spear, and Stargirl agrees to let Amaya take the Spear. \nRay gets ready to use Galahad's sword, which he has now upgraded with the use of his Atom gloves. Nate tries to convince him to run away from the battle, but Ray disagrees and says that it's worth fighting for the same beliefs as the soldiers. Nate tells Ray that he saw his funeral in his history book, and Ray doesn't care. \nSara and the rest of the Legends get ready to fly away in the Waverider, until Nate reveals that Ray is staying in Camelot. \nGuinevere knights Ray, which then changes Nate's history book. Mick, Stein, and Jax decide to join Ray in his fight, and Sara and Amaya eventually agree. The team prepares for the fight. \nStein, Jax, and Mick go into the med bay. Jax suggests that the transmitters work because of intensity and not IQ. Stein and Mick put on the transmitters and discover that Jax is right. \nGuinevere, Ray, Stargirl, Rip, and Darhk lead their respective armies. They begin fighting, and are soon joined by Amaya, Sara, and Nate. The battle continues. \nJax and Stein hook Mick up to the transmitter. He begins to send thoughts to King Arthur and the other soldiers, who return back to their normal selves. Arthur charges at Rip, throwing him off his horse and injuring him. Rip asks Darhk for help but Darhk abandons him. Ray runs after Darhk, while Sara approaches Rip. Rip thinks Sara is here to kill him, but she instead transports him into the Waverider. \nRay hunts for Darhk in the snowy forest. The pair start sword fighting, and Ray knocks Darhk down. Darhk appears ready to surrender, but instead shoots Ray with his laser gun, knocking him to the ground, and runs away. \nNate finds Ray in the forest, thinking he's unconscious. Ray wakes up and reveals that he was wearing pieces of his Atom suit underneath his armor. \nBack at the castle, Arthur thanks Amaya for protecting the Spear. Stargirl reveals to Amaya that she is staying in Camelot. Amaya and Nate get ready to leave, but Nate reveals that Sara is spending time with Guinevere. \nSara and Guinevere share a passionate goodbye which is only interrupted by Ray. Guinevere thanks him for his service, and Ray and Sara get ready to leave. Ray suggests that Sara give Guinevere a real goodbye. Sara goes back to Guinevere, and the two share a kiss. \nThe Waverider flies away. Mick teases Stein about how his brain ended up saving the day. Nate admits to Ray that legends are just as valid as history. He asks if Ray wants to know how he is now remembered in Camelot, and Ray says he would rather make up his history as he goes. Ray's book is revealed to show a drawing of Guinevere placing a crown on Ray's head. \nJax approaches Rip, who is in the Legends' cell. Jax threatens Rip, saying that Rip is no longer captain and will be killed if he hurts anyone on the ship. Jax leaves, and Rip summons Gideon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:00:19.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
