For example, is the free time you have after dinner best spent perusing social media or working on a personal project? \n\"It's all about opportunity cost, what you're giving up,\" says Ariely, whose book \" Payoff \" explores how to become more motivated. \"Calendars help us see the opportunity cost of our decisions.\" Photo: Mary R. Dan Ariely, behavioral economist and psychologist, says money isn't the only thing that motivates workers. \nHere's Ariely's formula for staying on top of your goals: Break down your big goals into small daily tasks. For example, if you wanted to write a book by the end of 2017, figure out how many pages you'd have to write each day to get there. Schedule time to do those daily tasks. For example, you could block 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. every night for writing. Enter your daily tasks into your calendar each day. The act of writing them down will remind you of your goal, the psychologist says. \n\"Writing [your goal] down on a calendar each day makes it easier for us to see what we give up,\" he says, \"and what progress we make.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:39:47.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
