Osterloh made the comments in a recent press meeting at MWC in Barcelona, where he also hinted at a timeline for the device’s launch.\n“There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” said Osterloh, adding, “You can count on a [Google Pixel] successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.”\nThough a Google Pixel successor arriving around October this year already seemed like a safe bet, Osterloh also confirmed that the handset would “stay premium,” says AndroidPIT , and stuck to his answer in the face of further questioning from journalists.\nSee also: Some Google Pixel and Pixel XL owners report new Bluetooth disconnect issues 1 week ago This appears to stand contrary to earlier speculation from 9to5Google which suggested Google is planning to introduce a budget Pixel device (alongside a premium one), previously thought to be called the Pixel 2B. However, it remains possible that Google is planning to create a budget Android device, simply without the Pixel name, to maintain a separation between its iPhone-competing Pixel brand and a lower-spec device.\nPrevious speculation regarding the Pixel 2 indicates it would include a higher price tag — possibly $50 more — a better CPU and camera (as you would expect) and the waterproofing seemingly omitted from the original Pixels .\nAre you disappointed to learn that Google won’t produce a less expensive Pixel? Or is Google right to target the premium market only?
