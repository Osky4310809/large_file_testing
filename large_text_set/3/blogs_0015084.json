Drop the Mic is already a viral, digital success as an ongoing popular segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The newly hatched version enlists entertainers from all over the world to engage in good old-fashioned rap battles and finds Mr. Meth and model Hailey Baldwin helming the event. A post shared by Ben Winston (@mrbenwinston) on Mar 15, 2017 at 9:11am PDT \nThe format pits four celebrities from various segments of the entertainment industry against each other and ultimately only one stands victorious. \nCreated by Corden, executive producer Ben Winston, Jensen Karp or “Hot Karl” (who wrote Kanye Owes Me $300 and writes many battle raps for The Late Late Show segment ) and Ed Thomas, the show officially airs May 2. \nSVP of Unscripted Series and Special Event Programming at TBS Michael Bloom spoke on the upcoming series. \n“’Drop the Mic’ is a funny, authentic, high-energy series that brings together Hip Hop, comedy and pop culture in a way we’ve never seen before,” he said. “Method, Hailey, James, Ben and their team will make sure our celebrity competitors bring their ‘A’ game to the stage.” \nMethod Man, of course, is no stranger to being in front of the camera. In addition to his countless music videos with Wu-Tang, Redman and a plethora of others, he’s also appeared on the big screen in movies like How High, Soul Plane, Garden State, Trainwreck with Amy Schumer and Key & Peele’s Keanu .
