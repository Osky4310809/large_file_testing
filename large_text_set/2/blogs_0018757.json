What can your company do to make sure it isn’t a surprise to you? If you work in the tech space, chances are you read Susan Fowler’s reflection on her “strange” year at Uber. If you haven’t, you can read it here . There have been other brave, amazing women speaking out about similar experiences (one that particularly resonated with me is Aimee Lucido’s ), and it feels as though a proverbial can of worms has been opened, full of tangible, specific examples of the sexism in tech that has been consistently alluded to over the years (although there have been examples for years, but perhaps none quite this well documented and quite frankly, crazy ). You might be asking, if this is such a huge problem, why haven’t more stories been shared? Why did it take until now for the industry to wake up? I can tell you, some of these types of stories have been shared. They have been shared over drinks, yoga, or behind trusted closed doors. Women have been too afraid to share, not only externally, but internally. Too afraid of the backlash, afraid that they won’t be heard, and of course, the negative impact it could have on the future of their career. As I sit here writing this Medium post, I feel all of these things. This post is not going to be about specific examples I personally have experienced, or heard from others. Just trust me that they exists, in some shape or form, and has probably happened to someone you know. I love tech, and I truly want to make it an amazing space to work for not only the current generation, but generations to come. We are changing lives and building incredible products, so how can we take a similar approach to building products that people love, to building companies that people love to work for? Lists seem to do well on Medium, so here is a list! Are you providing a way for your employees to give you feedback on their managers, leadership and the company culture? I’m not talking about having an HR rep or team, or weekly 1:1’s with their direct report. If they want to give feedback anonymously, how can they achieve this? Is it frequently? Quarterly isn’t enough. Will it truly be anonymous (hint: if they are the only woman on the team, they will think you know it’s them)? Do you provide mentorship across the company? Have you considered bringing in outside mentorship and coaching if you don’t have representation internally? If you are on the leadership team, it also does wonders if you take time to talk 1:1 with people in all levels of the company. You don’t need to be the last to know. I know you’re busy, but it will go a long way. 2. When you receive this feedback, what are you doing with it? Have you ever thought “this is one person’s opinion not everyone feels this way”? You know that saying, “where there’s smoke”, right? People don’t want to be unhappy at work. If they are going as far to provide this feedback in the first place, it should be treated seriously. It takes a lot of guts to report it in the first place. Also, don’t put it on them to come up with a solution. Not everyone loves to provide solutions to problems, nor are they properly equipped to do so. Putting it on the complainant to resolve conflict should not be the defacto response. 3. Take a look hard look at your leadership team This is a hard one. People typically build companies with and hire similar people that they trust and feel comfortable around. I get it. But, don’t be afraid to hire or promote people who think differently than you. Someone that disagrees with you should not be seen as confrontational or difficult, they will make you and your company better. Culture completely comes from the top, whether you see it in yourself or not. What is your leadership style? How might that style be negatively perpetuated, or received, by others? 4. Define your culture What is the type of company you want to create? Are your company perks all geared towards drinking beer and playing Ping Pong? Are you hiring all like-minded individuals? Are certain benefits, like flexible hours, only extended to certain roles within the organization? Are your social events always in the evening, causing parents to choose between family and team bonding? What is your parental leave policy? Is it easy to find, or do you make your employees have to ask the dreaded question? Read this . A good reminder here that no culture, is a culture. 5. Be understanding With the current political climate, a lot of underrepresented groups are feeling attacked and have their back up. Not only are they fighting for basic human rights that they shouldn’t be fighting for, but they are also fighting to be happy in their careers. My Twitter, Facebook and Medium feeds are no longer just Buzzfeed quizzes and Farmville requests, but articles about women’s bodies and our rights that question where we stand in this world. Please, be understanding of our anger, emotion and frustration. We are exhausted from fighting and are just trying make tech (and the world) the best place for all people to be. This is not a fight we want to have to fight, but it certainly is worth it. Note: Like most problems, solutions best come from a group of people with different and diverse opinions and mindsets, so if you have other suggestions, please leave them in the comments or reach out!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:43:48.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
