(AP Photo/Andre Penner, File) \nA Japanese biotechnology company has invested $500,000 in Precision Virologics, a St. Louis firm developing vaccines for diseases such as Zika and chikungunya. \nPrecision Virologics was founded by David Curiel, a Washington University professor of radiation oncology and cancer biology. It has licensed the vaccine technology from the university. \nPrecision says its Zika vaccine is biologically targeted to achieve a higher level of immunity than vaccines that are currently available. \nThe investment is from Tokyo-based Oncolys BioPharma. Oncolys Vice President Yasunari Kashihara said in a statement that he was impressed not only by Precision's initial vaccine, \"but also by the fast turnaround that the Precision platform technology allows. This technology can potentially be used for rapid vaccine development for the next emerging disease.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:12:23.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
