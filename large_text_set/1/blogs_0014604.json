Presumably the young nature of Tottenhamâ€™s squad means they pip their Premier League rivals. Chelsea in 3rd \nChelsea may be in first in the Premier League but come third in this Premier League table. \nThe top six in the Premier League make up the top six in the table below. \nIt seems fair to say that if Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez signed new contracts at Arsenal, the value of the Gunners squad could be improved considerably. \nOther notes of interest, are how poorly Leicester are doing since they have the 7th most valuable squad in the Premier League. \nAnd, well played Burnley, who look like avoiding relegation with the least valuable squad in the Premier League.
