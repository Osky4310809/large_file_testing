As 40,000 vets call for action, a campaigner argues the show is a disaster for dogs - especially flat-faced breeds such as pugs and bulldogs Share King Charles Spaniel with bulging eyes at Crufts this week Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nCrufts has once again been embroiled in controversy after awarding prizes to dogs some consider to be hideously overbred. Here, dog health campaigner and TV producer Jemima Harrison argues many show dogs belong at the vets... \n'To some, Crufts is the ­greatest dog show in the world. But for vet Mark Evans, in my BBC documentary ­Pedigree Dogs Exposed, it is ­simply “a parade of mutants”. \nAll of the dogs pictured here ­qualified for the canine extravaganza but should be at the vets. \nCrufts is a disaster for dogs – particularly for flat-faced breeds such as the pugs, French bulldogs and bulldogs, more popular now than ever thanks to celeb owners like Lewis Hamilton, David Beckham and Lady Gaga. \nInstagram is full of snoring, snorting, apparently smiling, ­flat-faced dogs. But they are gasping, not grinning, as we’ve bred the face off them. Their airways have been crushed and they suffer 10 times the amount of eye ­problems as they no longer have a muzzle to protect them. \nCambridge University research shows only about 10% of them can breathe completely normally and at least half need a vet’s attention or surgery to draw in a decent lungful of air.

Ten years ago, one in 50 dogs registered with the Kennel Club was flat-faced. Today, it is one in five. It adds up to a lot of misery – for both the dogs and the owners, who face huge vet bills to keep their pets alive.

Other breeds, too, endure a host of health ­problems. We have bred them too big, too small, too heavy, too short-faced, too long-faced, too wrinkly, too hairy or too bald. In the crazy world of dog breeding, extremes are too often the norm.

The Kennel Club banned incest matings – until then it was acceptable to breed mothers to sons and fathers to daughters. It also introduced vet checks at shows. \nBut it is not enough. Nearly 10 years on there are still dogs with physical problems. We still have this absolute obsession with purity – something that can only be maintained through massive amounts of inbreeding. \nSome breeds descend from fewer than 10 individual dogs. It has led to high levels of genetic disease in some – 60% of dobermans die of heart disease, often perishing on a walk, and an horrific number of cavalier King Charles spaniels have heart disease and the brain condition syringomyelia. Breeders have called me a witch, bitch and the c-word several times in the past few days but I don’t care because the dogs have to come first.
