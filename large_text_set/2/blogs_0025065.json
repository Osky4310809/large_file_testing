A baseball-sized fruit or half-cup of vegetables counts as a serving . \nBut consuming four times as much—or about 10 servings a day—was even better. People who ate 800 grams per day saw reductions of 24 percent for heart disease, 33 percent for stroke , 28 percent for cardiovascular disease, 13 percent for cancer, and 31 percent for premature death. \nSo, though the government recommends 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, meeting a 10-serving minimum could prevent 7.8 million deaths worldwide each year, according to the study. \nIf you want to boost those benefits, apples, pears, citrus fruits, leafy greens, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower are the best foods to fight heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and early death, according to a press release . The latter three are also good for combatting cancer, along with yellow veggies like carrots and peppers and green ones like green beans and spinach. \nBut fruits and vegetables both helped independently, so the good news is that even if you’re picky, any efforts to up your intake of either one could pay off.
