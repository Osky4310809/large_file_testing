For almost a year, he’d been caught between the urge to sleep and his brain refusing to surrender. Even as the heaviness settled in his eyes, a sudden, second wind would overtake him. When he did finally manage to drift off, the initial deep sleep never lasted long. Dark circles began to sag under his eyes.\nI knew we needed help. So I didn’t blink when our pediatrician suggested melatonin. “Safe and effective,” read the label on the first bottle I held in my hand. “It’s natural and something your body produces,” said the pharmacist, when we hesitated for just a moment. And with that, we were sold.\nOur story is not unusual, says Dr. Judith Owens, director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston Children’s Hospital. A child struggles with sleep, a pediatrician suggests a natural sleep aid and we breathe a sigh of relief. Owens says that in her practice, which focuses on children and families with sleep problems, it’s rare for a child to come in who hasn’t taken melatonin.\n“That was not true even five years ago,” Owens says.\nThe author and her son on a sleepless night near the onset of his sleep issues. Crystal Ponti A study from the National Center for Health Statistics of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) showed a significant increase in the use of melatonin among children ages 4 to 17 between 2007 and 2012, up from 0.1 percent to 0.7 percent, making it the most common non-vitamin supplement after fish oil/omega 3 fatty acids. Since publication, experts believe melatonin use has continued to rise in this population.\n“I cannot say with definitive statistics, but I will say I’ve seen an increasing trend while working at the pharmacy,” says Mohamed Jalloh, spokesperson for the American Pharmacists Association.\nBut how safe are these products for children? Because melatonin is classified as a dietary supplement, it is not subject to the same scrutiny as medications that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. And what’s in some bottles is alarming.\nA new study conducted at the Gosling Research Institute for Plant Preservation at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada suggests that the melatonin content of dietary supplements often varies widely from what is listed on the label, and some products may be contaminated with serotonin (a controlled substance responsible for maintaining mood balance, including depression).\nThe findings show that melatonin content did not meet within a 10 percent margin of the label claim in more than 71 percent of supplements, with the actual content ranging from 83 percent less to 478 percent more than the concentration declared on the label. About 25 percent of the supplements also contained significant amounts of serotonin.\n\n‘If you just put a child or adult on sleep medication and you don’t do the behavior interventions, well guess what? When you take them off the medication, the problem is still there.’\n - Dr. Judith Owens The products, which included liquids, capsules and chewable tablets, were common brands that can be purchased at grocery stores and pharmacies — the same brands parents might buy for their children. There are other risks associated with melatonin parents should be aware of, including short-term side effects such as headaches, dizziness and daytime grogginess.\nAlthough some evidence exists showing that melatonin is safer than previously administered sleep aids such as Benadryl, Owens says long-term follow-up studies are lacking.\nOne potential area of concern is how melatonin might impact puberty: Abundant melatonin levels are believed to delay puberty. When the supplement is stripped away, melatonin hormone levels drop, which in theory could cause early-onset puberty.\nBut far more worrisome to Owens is the ease with which children who suffer from sleep problems are given pills. In her opinion, behavioral therapy, alone or in conjunction with a sleep aid, should be the first step. “If you just put a child or adult on sleep medication and you don’t do the behavior interventions, well guess what? When you take them off the medication, the problem is still there,” says Owens.\nOwens says screen time is a huge factor. “If your child is sitting in front of a blue-light screen, like a TV or an iPad, until bedtime, you can give them all the melatonin in the world, but that blue light is suppressing their body’s own production of melatonin,” she says.\nInconsistent sleep schedules are also high on the list, with many children having no consistent bedtime routine.\nAs for my own son? After taking melatonin for six months, he grew increasingly restless. Sometimes he would wake up in the middle of the night screaming.\nNow that he’s been off of it for a month, he’s actually falling asleep at a regular bedtime. He looks like a completely new boy — no dark circles or bags! I don’t know if the melatonin helped regulate his sleep cycle — or if taking away all electronics earlier in the day also played a role. I just wish I had known what to ask the pediatrician before jumping on a quick fix.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:29:11.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
