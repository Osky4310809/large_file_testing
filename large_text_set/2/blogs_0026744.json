While there's no official nutritional information available just yet, Starbucks' version of the drink is made with espresso, almond milk, and cinnamon dolce syrup, topped off with their signature caramel cross-hatch and cinnamon. If you want to cut back on the sweet stuff, you'll be happy to hear that the cinnamon dolce syrup has a sugar-free option . Cinnamon Almond Macchiato (iced) via Starbucks \nThe Coconut Mocha Macchiato is said to have a lighter taste and is considered more refreshing. The drink features espresso shots poured over coconut milk, mixed with Starbucks' signature white chocolate mocha sauce, topped off with some caramel sauce and a swirl of mocha sauce. A Grande (16 oz) is only 200 calories but has 28 grams of carbohydrates and 25 grams of sugar. You can easily skip the toppings for a healthier option. Coconut Mocha Macchiato (iced) via Starbucks \nOf course, both drinks are available hot or cold and make for incredible dairy-free options. And the best part? You can try them at a Starbucks near you starting tomorrow—even though the first day of spring isn't for another 21 days. But hey, who's counting?
