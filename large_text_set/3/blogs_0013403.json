Don’t you think that the traditional media have conspiracy theories?” she asked. “I’ve read a ton of things about Russia intervening in the presidential campaign and other things like that – I mean there is at least as much fake news in the traditional media as on the Internet!” \nThe reporter then accused Le Pen of inciting people to find fake news. \n“Madame, French people have no confidence in the media whatsoever, are you aware of that, or not?” asked Le Pen.

In February, she was forced to cancel a meeting with the Grand Mufti of Al-Azhar after refusing to wear an Islamic headscarf while on a two-day tour of Lebanon. \n\"You can pass on my respects to the grand mufti, but I will not cover myself up,\" she insisted at the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:15:06.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
