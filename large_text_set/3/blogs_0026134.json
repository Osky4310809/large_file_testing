Futurpreneurs! And hey, new moms, you can take more time off with baby — but those EI payments will shrink accordingly. Here are a few items that had us scratching our heads\nHaving a baby? Enjoy less for longer! \n\nUnder employment insurance, families can now claim parental benefits over an extended period of 18 months, rather than 12 months. Hooray!\nThere’s a catch. If you opt for the longer haul, your benefit rate will drop to 33 per cent of weekly earnings, from 55 per cent if you decide only to take the year.\nEven so, the changes are expected to cost $152 million over five years, starting in 2017–18, and $27.5 million per year thereafter.\nRelated Stephen Gordon: With this federal budget, the Liberals have let the middle class down, again John Ivison: The Liberals may have slowed their spending, but their spin is relentless Andrew Coyne: No money, no ideas, but a wealth of bafflegab and buzzwords in the Liberal budget Sometimes, like a chocolate advent calendar, it simply costs more to get less for a longer time.\nIntroducing: Superclusters and Futurpreneurs! \nJustin Tang/Canadian Press Minister of Finance Bill Morneau speaks during a press conference, before tabling the budget in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill, in Ottawa on Wednesday, March 22, 2017. New buzzwords are at hand, because in Canada, better is always possible.\nSuperclusters, apparently, are more exciting versions of clusters, defined as “dense areas of business activity that contain large and small companies, post-secondary institutions and specialized talent and infrastructure.” Think Silicon Valley. In the next five years, Canada will put $950 million towards becoming super.\nProving that anything can be made more innovative by adding the word “future,” we bring you “futurpreneur.” The government will offer $14 million, over two years, to non-profit organization Futurpreneur Canada, which mentors and supports young businesspeople.\n(We tried to come up with a Back to the Futurpreneur pun but couldn’t come up with a one that was “super” enough.)\nWhither Defence? \nMARPAC/Department of National Defence There's little for the Canadian Forces in the 2017 budget. Only one-and-a-half pages are devoted to the Department of National Defence, on which Canada spends a full one per cent of its gross domestic product. There’s also nothing on cyber-security (not even one mention), which preoccupies Canada’s intelligence agencies.\nThat compares to four pages on “Canada’s digital future,” and, hey, a solid two pages (including an infographic that features a lightbulb) on superclusters.\nOstensibly, this is because the government is still finishing up its defence policy review, originally promised for the end of 2016.\nThe public consultations collected for that review ended in July — several months before the election of Donald Trump, who we hear has a few ideas of his own about the military and nuclear and stuff. Stay tuned!\nWho’s getting audited? \nSean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press The Canada Revenue Agency headquarters in Ottawa. At least three mystery departments will have the pleasure of being comprehensively reviewed starting this year.\nOn the chopping block: “poorly targeted and inefficient programs, wasteful spending, and ineffective and obsolete government initiatives.”\nWhew! Sure sounds like the feds have particular bureaucrats in mind when they level accusations like that at their own departments and agencies, eh?\nIf Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his crew do know who’ll be looked at, they aren’t telling us in this document. Reviewees will be determined after the budget’s release, it says. Surprise!\nAlberta: the new Quebec? \nChristopher Elliott / Handout A fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex greets visitors in Drumheller, Alberta. After decades of decrying federal slush funds shoring up Quebec’s social programs, Albertans are getting a $30 million payment with no strings attached.\nWednesday’s budget calls for “a one-time payment of $30 million to the Government of Alberta to support provincial actions that will stimulate economic activity and employment in Alberta’s resource sector.”\nScheduled for the 2017-2018 year, the payment is slightly less than $10 for every Albertan, according to census data.\nThe Liberals say their government “understands the challenging economic circumstances” for “this specialized work force.” That’s despite a budget proposal to shift tax incentives for oil and gas exploration toward geothermal heat projects.\n— Compiled by Marie-Danielle Smith and Dylan Robertson \n• Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:36:04.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
