They are going to be a team that is going to stick in it,” said Lighting coach Andrew Lazzor. “They are going go, and we just hit shots early on. Between the flow of the game there are going to be runs and we made ours early it so happened, as opposed to making that run late as we’ve done.” \nCentennial slowly clawed its way back in the following eight minutes, however, thanks to a crucial 7-2 run to end the half. \nElijah White was the catalyst, as he started off the period strong, ripping down an offensive board and getting the and-1 on the made put-back. \nHe then drained a three to begin Centennial’s late surge with 2:05 left in the half. Andrew Hohmann extended the run before White came up with a deflection at half court with seconds ticking down. Kaleb Addisu picked up the loose ball and dished it off to Corey Eudell in transition to cut the deficit, 29-21, with 2.3 seconds to spare before the break. \n“The second quarter energy defensively was completely different,” Hollwedel said. “We went off that defensive energy in the second quarter, so the message was just coming out in the third and set the tone defensively first and it got us going in transition, got us making our jump shots a little bit, which early we settled for.” \nWhite settling in from range in the third quarter. He hit his first three with 6:23 left in the period and then knocked down back-to-back 3-pointers midway through the quarter, which cut the deficit to four. \n“I told my team if we can get within 10 points, we can get this and we did it,” White said. “Coach told us to turn it up on defense. They didn’t really handle the pressure well toward the end. I think that was due to fatigue, but we started turning them over and got our offense running. We got a lot of fast break points and then just spreading them out. They wanted to play that zone, so spreading them out and getting our shots going. It just happened that I had the hot hand today, so I kept shooting until I went cold and then we kept trying to move the ball around.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T05:43:30.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
