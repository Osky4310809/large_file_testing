The Canadian Press   6:36PM EST \nHAMILTON -- McMaster University says two students were behind a \"misguided prank\" last month in which a library study room was booked for a \"McMaster KKK meeting.\" \nThe Hamilton university says library staff cancelled the booking a few hours after it was made and an investigation began. \nIt says study rooms are reserved through a self-booking website that requires a university ID. \nA report says the investigation found that two students made the booking as a prank. \nMcMaster says the students will receive education and sensitivity training that reflects the emphasis on accountability and education within the McMaster Student Code of Conduct. \nUniversity spokesman Gord Arbeau says the students \"understand the inappropriateness of their misguided prank.\" \nThe students \"have expressed regret and have been co-operative as we concluded our inquiry into the incident,\" Arbeau said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:49:02.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
