NIKLAS HALLE'N via Getty Images Stephen Hawking said he feared he was no longer welcome in the US \nHe said: “There was reported to be a memo that government scientists must get White House approval for any announcements. A similar ruling in Canada had a chilling effect on science there. \n“Everyday life in the United States continues much the same. \n“I have many friends and colleagues there, and it is still a place I like and admire in many ways. I would like to visit again, and to talk to other scientists. \n“But I fear that I may not be welcome.” \nWhen asked what his message for the US president was, Hawking singled out the issue of climate change. \nHe said: “He (Trump) should replace Scott Pruitt at the Environment Protection Agency. Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it’s one we can prevent. BREAKING: Prof. Stephen Hawking demands Trump fire one of his top cabinet picks, in an excl interview with @GMB .

God forbid.” \nTrump’s appointment of Pruitt was hugely controversial, given that he is a climate change sceptic who had previously been highly critical of the EPA. \nRemain voter Hawking also spoke about Britain’s impending divorce from the European Union, warning against a hard Brexit . \nHe said: “If we must implement the referendum decision to leave the EU, it shouldn’t be a hard Brexit as the right-wing of the Conservative Party want. \n“That would leave us isolated and inward-looking. Instead, we should retain as many links as possible with Europe and the rest of the world, particularly China.” \nHawking also once again criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , saying: “I don’t believe there will be much chance of Labour winning an election under him. It’s no good having the right principles if you never get in power. But I will continue to vote Labour, it is the party that matters.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:53:48.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
