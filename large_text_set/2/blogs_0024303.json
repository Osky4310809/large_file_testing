Here’s what you can use it for. Advertisement \nCommonly called lash tabs or pig snouts, these patches are meant to hold stuff that might not fit in your bag or that you want easy access to, like a rolled up jacket or water bottle. You can even use it for larger items, like a pair of shoes or flashlight, when traveling or exploring outdoors. Simply attach whatever you want to carry to a thin rope and loop it through the patch’s slits. Make sure whatever you attach is secure and don’t use it for any valuables that are more exposed to damage or theft when tied to the outside of your bag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:18:41.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
