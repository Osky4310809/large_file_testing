The RealReal; Business Insider \nSilicon Valley, land of hoodies and startup tees, isn't known for its dazzling fashion. But a leather high-top sneaker from Louis Vitton, which retailed for $745 before it went out of production, has captured the hearts and wallets of Startupland, according to a new report from Bloomberg . \nThe Louis Vitton Damier high-top sneaker is the top-selling item among online shoppers in San Francisco and Silicon Valley on The RealReal , an online luxury consignment shop, Bloomberg reports. The shoe is available in a variety of styles and fetches around $500 in good condition. \nAs Bloomberg notes, the checkered-patterned sneaker is the \" opposite of understatement.\" Like the love child of a vintage pair of trainers and Vans shoes, it appears youthful and chic. \nWe found versions of the shoe sold on The RealReal in the range of $275 to $525 . It's unclear how many units have sold on the site and how its sales fared compared to similar items. \nThe sneaker has undergone a sort of \"fashion baptism,\" as the New York Times reported in 2014 . As dress codes go lax and designers turn their attention to the \"athleisure\" market, men and women have more stylish, workplace-appropriate options than ever â€” high-tops included. \nIn 2016, Wool Runners from San Francisco startup Allbirds became the must-have sneaker in Silicon Valley . Called the \"world's most comfortable shoe\" by venture capitalists, startup founders, and the company itself, the shoes are made from wool and retail for $95. \nIf you spot the Louis Vitton Damier in the wild, shoot us an with a photo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:25:12.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
