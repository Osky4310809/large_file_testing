Ezeigbo of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Federal University Ndufu Alike Ikwo (FUNAI), Ebonyi, spoke on Monday in Abakaliki at a symposium organised by Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA), Ebonyi branch. The theme of the symposium is “Bring Back the Book Campaign.”Ezeigbo said, “The socio-economic, security and political problems of Nigeria will be better addressed through the provision of viable education. “Sound and functional education equip the individual with the ability to think logically, rationally and be disciplined in their actions and behaviour. “When somebody acquires good education, he becomes disciplined in his actions, as well as rational and logical in his thinking. “You cannot ask the person to go and kill, maim or destroy and the person will just carry out the order without weighing the consequences. “I think the strategy for government to adopt in fighting insecurity and address the political and socio-economic problems confronting the country, is to first look at the education sector. “Government should make the sector functional; people should have access to qualitative and affordable education. “If you check those youths who are involved in one form of criminality or the other, you will discover that they do not have proper education. “Education is the answer and key to addressing these challenges of the Nigerian state,’’ the don said. She urged the local, state and the federal governments to adequately fund the education sector. According to her, wealthy individuals and corporate organisations should also invest in the education industry. The lecturer commended the association for organising the symposium, as the campaign would go a long way to re-awaken interest in reading and writing. “I want to commend the organisers of this educational summit, which in my estimation will go a long way in reawakening interest in reading and writing, especially among the youths. “There is a steady decline in reading and writing among pupils and students and even among our undergraduates; however, this symposium will restore this lost academic glory,’’ Ezeigbo said. The state chairman of ANA, Mr Matthew Odonor, said that the` `Bring Back the Book Campaign,’’ was part of the association’s contributions to address the falling standard of education in the state. He said that reading and writing were important in the development of a child’s mental and intellectual capacity. According to him, the association will partner the government, private individuals and organisations, to discover potential literary creative writers and encourage them to develop their writing skills. He said that the symposium was also organised to celebrate Ezigbo for her immense contributions to the growth and development of literature. “We organised this educational symposium, first, to reawaken the interest of students on the importance of cultivating reading and writing habits. “We believe the idea will address some of the challenges, including examination malpractice and other forms of indiscipline seen in our educational institutions. “Reading and writing will enable a student to develop his creative ability, as well as the rational and logical reasoning that will make him a solution provider. “Again, we are using the symposium to honour one of Nigeria’s foremost literary icons, Ezeigbo, for her contributions to the development of literary creativity in Nigeria, Africa and the world,’’ he said. The symposium featured the reading of extracts from selected literary works of some of Nigeria’s celebrated literary writers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:57:39.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
