(Who are these people?) “To say he is pissed would not even begin to do justice to the level of his anger right now. But the main feeling he’s experiencing is humiliation. He seriously can’t believe this has happened to him — he never in a million years thought he would fall victim to a betrayal like this, and he feels violated.”\nRelated: This Week In Leaks: America’s Next Top Model’ Contestant Dustin McNeer Has Something To Show You \nThe mysterious, motormouthed source has even more to say: “Cody doesn’t even want to leave the house or answer the phone, let alone think about heading back to work.”\nMeanwhile, fans are apparently standing in solidarity with the actor and refusing to watch — or, at the very least, stridently lying about refusing to watch.\nA hashtag has even popped up — #WeRespectYouCody — which we’re not sure is doing anything to salve his humiliation. And, erm, wait… this just in: Apparently, Teen Wolf ‘s Tyler Posey has also just had his nude photo leaks, so there’s also the hashtag #WeRespectYouTyler.\nThis wrinkle has caught us completely off-guard, so let us grapple with it together for a moment.\n\nSo. Now a good chunk of the cast of Teen Wolf has been caught with their pants down, and here’s a taste of what Twitter has to say about it:\nThey don't deserve it. We respect you guys, and we are with you always. #werespectyoutyler #werespectyoucody pic.twitter.com/WZqXTrnp7n \n— Teen Wolf Help (@helpteenwolf) January 15, 2017 \n\nTYLER AND CODY DESERVE SO MUCH LOVE AND HAPPINESS AND SUPPORT? #WeRespectYouCody #WeRespectYouTyler pic.twitter.com/z9y5lTqBKx \n— Shipper Heart (@JarunaStilinsk3) January 15, 2017 \n\nNeither of them deserve this!!! ? #WeRespectYouTyler #WeRespectYouCody pic.twitter.com/KjOYsrODVW \n— Stiles O'Brien (@Greenskys123) January 16, 2017 \n\n#werespectyoutyler #werespectyoucody when will people learn privacy?
