Ortega reportedly also might have stolen items from Denver Broncos pass rusher Von Miller after Super Bowl 50. \nWhile much has been made of the resources poured into finding Brady’s jerseys, it’s probably also not worth turning a blind eye to a reporter stealing and hoarding hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Super Bowl merchandise. \nBrady released a statement Monday on his jerseys being found, saying he hopes he can make “something very positive” come from the recovery. It will be interesting to find out what that means. \n  NESN.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:24:29.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
