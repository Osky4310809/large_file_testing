I was always kind of by myself, in a good way, but now it's like, fully flipped.\" \nAs previously reported, the reality star arrived home in her car the night of August 14, 2016, and found a man waiting outside for her.

He just looked like a homeless man,\" Jenner told her mom, Kris Jenner , and Scott Disick . \"I drove around and went into my house and I watched the gate close. I turned my car off, getting my stuff together. I'm about to open my door and look in my rear-view mirror and he was standing right there. In the gate, right behind my car.\" Kendall Jenner's Bikini Body \nShe started \"freaking out\" as the man said, \"I need to talk to you.\" \n\"I was like, 'No, you need to leave,'\" she continued. \"I called one of my friends immediately. I'm sobbing, crying. He was at my window, banging on my window, screaming at me.\" \nJenner backed out of her driveway and as she drove through the gate, the man started running after her. And that's when her friends arrived and forced the man to sit on the curb as they waited for the police to arrive and arrest the man for trespassing. \"I'm like crying, I'm freaking out,\" she added.
