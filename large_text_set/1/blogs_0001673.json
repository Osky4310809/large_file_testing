It will only lead you to the same place of disconnection. You have to start over and build something new. \n\nGiphy \nYou can’t change things if you don’t look at them objectively and honestly . You have to get real about what’s happening — for you and for your relationship. \nYou have to accept the truth that the two of you are starting to drift/grow apart so you can begin the process of course-correction. And being honest can be scary, as you have to be vulnerable and willing to look at things objectively. \n\nMemes \nToo often, couples stuck in a rut look at the other person as the problem. They don’t invest anymore. They don’t do what I want. They aren’t passionate/loving/affectionate. If they conversation starts with “You” statements (i.e. “You don’t pay attention to me.”), it will create an adversarial discussion that is rooted in defensiveness. \nThe result will be two people who are defending themselves instead of listening with empathy . Instead, discuss how you feel with statements that reflect you, not them. \nExample: Instead of “You don’t spend any time with me anymore,” say “I feel like I don’t matter to you,” or “I feel ignored by you.” This allows them to hear your view/feelings, and then discuss why you might feel that way — as well as how they are potentially contributing to it. \nAs the two of you examine the situation, work to accept their point of view as their truth… even if you don’t agree with them. \n\nWiffleGif \nDiscussion is great, but it takes action to shift things. One of the biggest issues facing couples is time — or a lack thereof. Commutes, jobs, housework, kids, hobbies, finances… everything plays a part of how couples disconnect. \nThings are deemed “necessary” or “more important,” so the marriage/relationship is looked at as the thing they “will get to later, when there’s time.” But that time often doesn’t come until it’s too late. \nMake your relationship a priority , and the rest of things will fall into place. Planning time together is critical. But more importantly, a disconnected couple looking to reconnect needs to get back to the things that connected them in the first place. \nCall them in the middle of the day for no reason — just to say hello. \nLeave them a note in their coat pocket. Show your kids that mom-and-dad time is just as important as family time — and then go on a date without the kids in-tow. Kiss them goodnight instead of just saying it. The little things and behaviors will always go further than big gifts. \n\nTumblr \nOne of the biggest challenges in any relationship is allowing them to see you emotionally stripped down . When fear and disconnection are present, it’s nearly impossible to allow them “in.” You fear being judged. You “know what they are going to say.” You resent them for [insert reason here]. \nTo break this pattern, you have to get to a place where you go all-in. You have to reset things and get to a place where you put your effort in and let the past go. \nIf you want to stay connected and avoid the need for something as radical and drastic as Switch Therapy — where you risk your marriage in order to save it — you have to remember one simple thing: relationships and marriages are made up of two individuals. Those individuals will always be learning, growing, and adding to their experiences — both as individuals and as a couple. \nWake up each morning not knowing them and, instead, discover them each day. \nIf you do, you will stay connected. If you don’t, you might end up on Seven Year Switch looking for answers. \n\nSeason 2 of \"Seven Year Switch\" premieres January 3rd at 8 pm on FYI.
