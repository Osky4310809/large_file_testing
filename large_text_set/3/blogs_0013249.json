This made me very sad, but satisfied as the boy told me how badly his arm hurt many days later and how he would never try anything like that again.”\nThe dangers of social media trends among young people were laid bare recently, when we reported how a mom issued a warning to other parents about a disturbing Snapchat bullying game.\nThis involved teens competing to see who could say the cruelest thing about a chosen victim.\nIn January, we told how there were fears bored teens were dislocating their thumbs ‘for fun’ as people shared revolting photos of their mangled digits alongside bizarre how-to posts.\nAnd last year we told how teens viciously insulted each other online as part of a social media trend called the Huh Challenge.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:14:09.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
