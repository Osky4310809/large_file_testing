Past winners include Thomas Tait, Marques’Almedia and Grace Wales Bonner . After launching an open call for applications last month, industry powerhouse LVMH has already shot back with a shortlist of 21 designers, all vying for the chance to win the prize of €300,000 ($318,000) and support from the LMVH Group for one year. \nWho decides the winners? A carefully-selected panel of jurors (including J.W. Anderson and Karl Lagerfeld) and industry experts will make the call, under the supervision of Delphine Arnault, who is Director and executive Vice President of Louis Vuitton. A new addition to the panel of experts for 2017 is model-of-the-moment Kendall Jenner. She’ll be joining the likes of seasoned fashion critic Cathy Horyn, along with CR Fashion Book founder Carine Roitfeld. \nYou can get see a list of the 21 pre-selected designers below, and we’re particularly happy to see Ambush , Martine Rose , Dilara Findikoglu , and GmbH make the cut.
