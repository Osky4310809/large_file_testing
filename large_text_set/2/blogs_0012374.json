After a reported wait for 50 minutes, GNR's announcer/technician, McBob, hit the stage with a thunderous \"Sydneeyyy! You wanted the best but they're stuck in traffic...\"\nMelbourne was half offended, half amused.\nHahahah most hilarious start to a show in #Melbourne ever.... \"Hello #sydney !!!\" Crowd responds ya .. wait...

Thank you for coming out tonight!\nâ€” Guns N' Roses (@gunsnroses) February 14, 2017\nHey, we get it. The hard rock lifestyle is bound to fry one's brain to some extent after a few decades. G.O.A.T guitarist Slash followed up with a more self-effacing take.\nMelbourne, thank you for an awesome fucking evening! Apologies for the Spinal Tap intro! But, we had a great fucking time tonight!
