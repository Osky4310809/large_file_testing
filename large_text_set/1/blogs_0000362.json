But with the Chargers having lost their last five games — including giving Cleveland their first win of the year — as well as having leads in the last five minutes of at least three of their losses this season, it’s not hard to see why they finally made the move.\n“I want to thank Mike for his tireless work and commitment to this organization,” said General Manager Tom Telesco. “He instilled a culture of work ethic and togetherness that we can build on for years to come.”\nChargers President of Football Operations John Spanos said, “Our team’s disappointing performance has not matched this team’s potential and has fallen short of the demanding standards that we seek to impose throughout our organization. Our comprehensive search for a new head coach begins immediately.”\nMcCoy was 27-36 during his tenure with the team. In McCoy’s first year, he led the Chargers to a 9-7 record and a playoff appearance, something that Norv Turner was unable to do in his final three seasons as coach. The team won their Wild Card matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, but ultimately lost to the Broncos in the Divisional round. In 2014, the Chargers finished 9-7 yet again, but were unable to make a postseason appearance. 2015 was an even steeper decline as they finished 4-12, good for last in the AFC West.\nBefore the 2016 season even started, things didn’t start great during the offseason as it took the team several months to sign the third overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, Joey Bosa. As the season started, the offense took a big hit as third-year wide receiver Keenan Allen suffered a season-ending torn ACL against the Kansas City Chiefs. \nMcCoy spent his first eight years in the NFL with various offensive assistant positions with the Carolina Panthers from 2000-08. After his tenure with the Panthers, McCoy was hired as the offensive coordinator with the Denver Broncos from 2009-12, where he was in charge of a prolific offense in Peyton Manning’s first season in Denver in 2012, helping lead the team to a 13-3 record.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T03:54:00.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
