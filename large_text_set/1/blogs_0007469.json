FOX NEWS Nigel Farage appeared on Fox News ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration next week \nNigel Farage , speaking ahead of his trip to Washington for the inauguration of Donald Trump , said the prime minister should be concentrating on striking up a better relationship with the incoming US president. \n“Next Friday, in Washington, there will be swearing in of the 45th president of the USA – somebody who recognises the close relationship historically and culturally between our two countries,” Mr Farage said. \n“What she should be doing is grabbing that opportunity in my opinion with both hands,” he finished. GETTY Theresa May said she was not prepared to keep \"bits\" of EU membership \nOn Tuesday, Boris Johnson claimed the UK is “first in line” for a trade deal with the US post-Brexit. \nThe Foreign Secretary had been on a visit to New York to hold talks with the president-elect’s advisors, just days before he is sworn into office. \nIn contrast to Barack Obama – who warned Britain would be at “the back of the queue” when it came to Brexit trade talks – Mr Trump is said to be eager to take a different approach. \nAfter the meeting held at Trump Tower in New York, Mr Johnson said: “Clearly, the Trump administration-to-be has a very exciting agenda of change. \n\"We hear that we are first in line to do a great free-trade deal with the United States. \n\"So, it's going to be a very exciting year for both our countries.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T11:46:07.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
