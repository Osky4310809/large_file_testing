Soon after, the IRS began targeting patriotic Americans for abuse, harassment and delay of their non-profit status applications in order to stunt their freedom to speak out during hotly contested political races. It was a stunning show of the Obama Administration’s abuse of power, and justice has not been served, even though the IRS admitted at the highest levels to this behavior. \nFreeBeacon reports that there’s a new development in the case: \nThe Internal Revenue Service has located 6,924 documents potentially related to the targeting of Tea Party conservatives, two years after the group Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for them. \nThe watchdog group intended to find records regarding how the IRS selected individuals and organizations for audits that were requesting nonprofit tax status. \nThe agency will not say when it will make the documents available to the public. \n“At this time, the Service is unable to provide an estimate regarding when it will complete its review of the potentially responsive documents,” the agency said. “The Service will begin producing any non-exempt, responsive documents by March 10, 2017, and, if necessary, continue to produce non-responsive records on a bi-weekly basis.” \nCan you imagine what would happen if, come April 15th, you just couldn’t seem to locate some very important personal tax information to send it to Uncle Sam? And these guys expect us to accept that they simply can’t put their hands on these documents. Please. \nAs Stephen Green said , “It takes time to take time.” Stay in touch with Mark Meckler and Patheos Red on Facebook:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T17:54:41.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
