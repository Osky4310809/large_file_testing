Check some of the others out below. \n\n \nImprovements to pre-existing emojis include the “cowboy face”, which now has a bigger hat (thank goodness) and the green nauseated face, which looks much better without the red cheeks. \nNote that these emojis may change without warning prior to release — don’t get too attached to them before the official rollout.\nOf the new additions, I’d say the gorilla is my favorite so far, what’s yours?
