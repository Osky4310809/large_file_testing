Earlier this month, she claimed in a sworn statement to a judge, Chris “told a few people that he was going to kill me.” He allegedly told her friends if he can’t have her no one else can, and threatened he was going to “take me out” and “threatened to shoot me.”\nKarrueche reportedly has reason to believe Chris might make good on that threat. In addition to the abuse we know he’s capable of as a result of his relationship with Rihanna, Karrueche said several years ago Chris “punched me in my stomach twice” and “pushed me down the stairs.” According to TMZ, this happened while Chris was on probation for beating Rihanna.\nFriends of Karrueche have been threatened as well, the legal documents state, which isn’t hard to believe after witnessing Chris try to get in a car with Karrueche after leaving a nightclub in LA in 2015 and telling one of her friends, “Move to the back before I make you move.”\n\nHe also posted this video a few weeks back hinting at his stalkerish ways when it comes to exes.\n\nHopefully Karrueche is comforted by this restraining order, which requires Chris stay 100 yards away from her, her mom and her brother.\nThe post Karrueche Tran Awarded Restraining Order Against Chris Brown After He Allegedly Threatens To Shoot Her appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:41:52.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
