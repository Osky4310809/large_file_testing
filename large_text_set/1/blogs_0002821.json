We were watching a passive, boring, insipid performance,\" Neville told Sky Sports. \n\"Now there is counter-attack, excitement. Pogba is getting better and better, Ibrahimovic is getting better and better. There is a lot more mobility, and in the wide areas there is a big change. They have stumbled across a back four; they are getting better and have shown they have some grit, determination and fight. \n\"If I speak as a neutral first, where United are at this time is not good enough. However, as a fan over the last couple months, it is better. There is more personality, guts and strength.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:35:12.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
