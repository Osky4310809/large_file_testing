No wonder education in America is down the tubes: You have people like Nicol poisoning the minds of young adults. \n“You talk to each other, you care for each other. If someone is having a mental health breakdown, you attend to them, you provide health care. You stop criminalizing people for their gender or for not having a gender or whatever they choose,” Nicol stated, claiming that police departments should be abolished and that local communities can solve all the problems of the world without them.   \nPolice officers risk their lives every day to keep us safe. I’d like to see Nicol, or any of the delicate snowflakes she teaches, try to step outside their academic bubble and do what police officers do every day. \nIf these liberals were exposed to the real world, they wouldn’t last five minutes. They’d probably sit down, cry and ask for a therapy dog because they don’t posses the mental ability to deal with real-world problems. \nH/T WZ \nShare this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what other horrible things you have heard liberals say about police officers.
