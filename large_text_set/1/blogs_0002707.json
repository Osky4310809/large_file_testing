Advertisement \nAs Antonio Centeno at the Real Men Real Style YouTube channel demonstrates, all you need is a horsehair brush (or very soft bristled brush), some wax shoe polish that matches the color of your shoes, and a soft rag (an old t-shirt works great.) Start by laying out an old rag for your shoes to be shined on, and sticking some shoe horns in your shoes so they retain their shape. Then use the brush to remove dust, dirt, and other debris from your shoes. Once they’re clean, wrap your soft rag tightly around two fingers and apply polish to your shoes using small, circular motions. After the shoes dry a bit, use the brush once more to buff and remove the polish. \nIdeally, this quick-shine method should only be done to your shoes about four or five times for every full, traditional shoe shine . So save it for when you’re running late or on the go while traveling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T02:08:24.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
