According to a study of over 350,000 email threads by the productivity app Boomerang , your sign-off really does make a difference. \nBoomerang studied emails from over 20 online communities' mailing lists. Eight closings—\"thanks,\"\"regards,\"\"cheers,\"\"best regards,\"\"thanks in advance,\"\"thank you,\"\"best,\" and \"kind regards\"—were used more than a thousand times. \nIf you're using one of those, you're already ahead of the game. They all yielded higher response rates than the 47.5 percent average. And if your email signature somehow expresses appreciation, you're in even better shape. The top three were \"thanks in advance\" (65.7 percent), \"thanks\" (63 percent), and \"thank you\" (57.9 percent). Overall, 46 percent of emails with no variation of \"thank you\" got responses, which means that just adding one thankful sentiment gives your shots at a reply a 36 percent boost. \nThen came, in order, \"cheers\" (54.4 percent), \"kind regards\" (53.9 percent), \"regards\" (53.5 percent), \"best regards\" (52.9 percent), and \"best\" (51.2 percent). \nSimilarly, Boomerang points out, a 2010 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people were over twice as likely to answer emails containing “Thank you so much!” \nAnother takeaway is that if your personal response rate is low, it's not you. Even the emails with the best closings still got answers less than two thirds of the time. And over half of British workers have been ghosted during a job search, according to one survey . \nStill, it's nice to know we have at least some control over the situation—and that a bit of politeness doesn't go unnoticed.
