His eye popped out of its socket after a defender accidentally hit him in the face while they were both going for a rebound. Mitchell remained on the ground writhing in pain for about 15 minutes before he was helped off the court. Fortunately, he didn’t sustain any major damage to his eye, and it sounds like he will be fine after a brief recovery period.
