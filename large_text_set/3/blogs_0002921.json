The lack of this now common feature might be a disappointment to Samsung fans, but it looks like the company has plans to adopt dual camera tech for its future phones. — Samsung Exynos (@SamsungExynos) March 6, 2017 A tweet posted from the Samsung Exynos Twitter account confirms that the upcoming Exynos 8895 chipset features dual ISP (image signal processor) support for dual cameras. The image in the tweet even shows a mockup a phone with dual cameras. We already know that the Exynos 8895 will power a majority of Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ variants, including those headed to India, but it doesn’t seem like Samsung will utilise its dual camera capabilities just yet. However, the chipset is likely to be used in the brand’s next flagship, possibly the Galaxy Note 8, so we could see a dual-camera implementation later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:01:02.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
