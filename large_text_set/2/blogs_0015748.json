Well now it can.\nChristopher Hesse has created an image-to-image translator , which is a program that has been trained to recognize certain visual cues and will match them with a corresponding photo.\nHesse has created a few different iterations of the translator, one of which can generate building facades. Another can generate shoes, and still another does handbags. All of these generators are designed to read the doodle approximation of the object and then output an image that closely matches from a database of photos.\nSEE ALSO: This epic log flip challenge is the internet's next bottle flip\nIn a weird turn from the norm, Hesse also created a version that turns doodles into cats, using the same principle. He tweeted out the exemplar for what this would look like.\nImage-to-Image Tensorflow Demo https://t.co/KUdUPA1IXx pic.twitter.com/1QQPyGlo1F\n‚Äî Christopher Hesse (@christophrhesse) February 19, 2017\nCute, right? It would be great for us to have our terrible cat doodles turned magically into a very photo-realistic cat.\nSince Hesse put the generator on the internet for anyone to use, people with our same thought have given it a try. The results were 100 percent not what Hesse showed us in his photo.\nYour attempts at a basic cat drawing becomes magically turned into some monstrous approximation of a real thing and you are left with unnatural horrors. Fun!\nThis is what we got when we tried to input a very basic doodle.\nImage: affine layer\nNot great.\nHere are what other people got.\nI hate this pic.twitter.com/SqJooTiZ7J\n‚Äî Lucid‚ô•Bishounencon (@llllucid) February 22, 2017\nImage-to-Image Demo https://t.co/KnKHnNNAb9 Áå´ pic.twitter.com/0MT7rlCJe5\n‚Äî „Åå„ÅÑÂ≠ê„Åè„Åò„Çì (@gaiko_kujin) February 22, 2017\nI'm an artist!
