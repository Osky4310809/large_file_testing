The resulting law — Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism — has now resulted in over 800 9/11 families and 1,500 first responders joining together in one massive lawsuit. Together, the group alleges the Saudi government “knowingly provided material support and resources to al-Qaeda.”\nPreviously, Obama’s hesitation over the bill involved concern that any litigation would damage relations between the U.S. and a Middle Eastern ally. Further, Obama feared that foreign governments would retaliate with their own lawsuits while accusing a U.S. citizen or group (accurately or not) of terrorism. However, Congress’s near-unanimous vote showed their desire to let families have their day in court. The law — Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism — has allowed first responders and families to seek monetary relief as detailed by NBC New York:\nThe families accuses Saudi Arabia of raising and providing money to al-Qaeda for terrorist activities, including terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, safe houses, weapons and false passport and travel documents, according to the lawsuit.\nThe families are seeking monetary damages, with separate awards for each plaintiff plus interest, costs, punitive damages and other damages and fees.\nOut of the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks, 15 were Saudi Arabian . Last year, U.S. intelligence findings were gathered up and released in the declassified “28 Pages” report , which included loads information (some of it not entirely new) about persons of interest who received enormous funding from Saudi elites, who helped to finance training and living expenses for the hijackers. The new lawsuit was filed by filed by Kreindler & Kreindler out of New York, and although the amount of sought-after damages has not been revealed, the lawsuit is sure to cause ripples.\n(Via NBC New York )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:47:18.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
