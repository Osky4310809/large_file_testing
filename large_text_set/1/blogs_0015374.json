This is a very good contract, and transit workers deserve every ounce of economic gain in it,\" said TWU Local 100 President John Samuelsen in a statement. \"People in cushy high-rise offices aren’t the only ones who deserve to get ahead of inflation. We’re the ones out there on the front lines moving 8 million people a day. We are injured, assaulted, killed and sometimes flat out murdered on the job. This is a good and just contract for transit workers and our families.” \nThe contract includes a variety of factors aimed at meeting the goal of allowing transit workers to save money for their futures, such as the ability to cash out at least 50 percent of their unused sick days when they resign or retire, regardless of the number of sick days they have accrued. \nUnion officials said this could give workers more money to start their retirements. \nAnd an unprecedented \"Me Too\" clause means that if Long Island Rail Road workers get bigger wage increases in their contract, the MTA has to put forward a matching increase in bus and subway workers' wages. \nOther aspects of the contract include dental coverage for dependents up to 26 years old, better boots and shoes for workers who currently receive them from the MTA, a uniform cleaning allowance for station cleaners, promises to address concerns of female workers and to increase construction staff by at least 100 workers and a decrease in workday length for bus maintainers from 8.5 hours to 8 hours, with no loss in pay. \nTWU Local 100's executive board was voting on the contract Tuesday afternoon. The contract will then go to a vote by the union's members, likely within the coming weeks, union officials said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:21:16.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
