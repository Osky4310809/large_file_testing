By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 28, 2017 9:06 AM CM Kejriwal will meet the L-G to demand action against ABVP after Gurmehar Kaur had complained of receiving “rape threats” allegedly from the right-wing students’ organization members. (PTI) \nThe political slug fest over Ramjas college row is set to escalate with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal meeting Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal this afternoon. CM Kejriwal will meet the L-G to demand action against ABVP after Gurmehar Kaur had complained of receiving “rape threats” allegedly from the right-wing students’ organization members. Notably, Kargil martyr’s daughter Gurmehar Kaur, who came under harsh criticism from BJP members and certain sections of the society for her campaign against violence in the name of nationalism, today announced that she is ‘withdrawing from the campaign’. “I’m withdrawing from the campaign. Congratulations everyone. I request to be left alone. I said what I had to say,” Kaur tweeted this morning. She also vented her frustration, saying, “I have been through a lot and this is all my 20 year self could take.” Underlining that the ‘campaign is about students and not about’ her, she asked protesters to join a march, which will be taking place later today. “Please go to the March in huge numbers. Best of luck,” she said. “One thing is for sure, next time we will think twice before resorting to violence or threats and that’s all this was about,” she said. \nHitting out at those who had trolled her, she said, “To anyone questioning my courage and bravery.. I’ve shown more than enough.” It has been learned that students and teachers from Delhi University and JNU will hold a march from Khalsa College to Arts Faculty. According to reports, left-wing student organization AISA will carry out march even as NSUI is planning to sit on hunger strike. \nPolice had said they were examining the letter received by the Delhi Commission for Women demanding security for a Kargil martyr’s daughter, who complained of receiving “rape threats” allegedly from ABVP members. Kaur, daughter of Kargil martyr Captain Mandeep Singh, started the campaign “I am not afraid of ABVP” following violence at Ramjas college. It went viral and received massive support from students across universities. \nPolice said they were “examining the matter on priority”. “She has neither given any complaint nor approached police. However, we have received a letter from DCW. We are examining it on priority. Professional police action will be taken,” said Dependra Pathak, Special Commissioner of Police (Southwest) and spokesperson of Delhi Police.
