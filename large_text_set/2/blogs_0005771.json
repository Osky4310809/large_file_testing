Here’s why—and what to do about it By Alison Bonaguro February 7, 2017 Getty Images Your Privacy Rights Canadian Customers \nIf Mickey Rourke was my boyfriend, our Valentine’s Day dinners would be spent in front of an open refrigerator eating cherries, jalapeños, Jell-O, wine, and the contents of an entire bottle of honey, while Bread and Butter provided the backing track for our inevitable kitchen-floor orgy. \nI just know it. \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nAt least that’s what I thought when I first saw the classic erotic drama 9½ Weeks . That movie and countless others lead you to believe that a romantic meal is the perfect foreplay to a night of great sex. \nIt’s a universal rite of passage when we all inevitably discover that a large quantity of food and booze is actually the cruelest cock blocker in relationships everywhere. Who wants to screw after housing a bread basket, a bottle of wine, and a box of truffles? Not a single woman I know, that’s who. And you’re not immune, either—don’t forget about good ol’ whiskey dick. \nAnd yet, we all insist on going out to dinner on “romantic” holidays like Valentine’s Day and anniversaries. \nThis contradiction inspired some genius advice from nationally syndicated sex columnist Dan Savage: F*** first. As in, flip the script, and make great sex the foreplay to your romantic dinner. \n“If you want to make sure you get f***ed on Valentine's Day, f*** first, then go out to dinner,” Savage explains on his blog on TheStranger.com. “Not only will the sex be out of the way, but it's easier to get a reservation at 9 or 10 o'clock, and then when you go home you won't be going home to performance anxiety or disappointment if nothing happens.” \n(To last longer in bed, try K-Y Duration Spray , which contains Lidocaine to delay ejaculation. Just beware that you can’t use it with a condom, and make sure to give your partner a heads up first.) \nYes, he says you should “get sex out of the way.” Like doing your income taxes before you go on vacation. \nIs that how we should think about sex—as something to cross off our nightly to-do list—especially on one of the most allegedly romantic days of the year? \nMaybe. Because here are some sad stats: \nOne recent survey finds that nearly 30 percent of 18 to 34 year olds are not getting laid on February 14. \nAnd when women are surveyed, the results are not promising for guys. As in, 41 percent of women in a relationship actually dread Valentine's Day more than any other holiday, and 34 percent of them say they'd rather just watch TV than have sex. \nMy guess is they’ve just been doing it wrong, and screwing on a full stomach. \nIf and when you do heed Savage’s advice, chances are you’ll never go back to after-dinner sex again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:54:12.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
