This is why we’re giddy to see pics of Kristen Stewart casually attending the Tommy Hilfiger fashion show to support ~rumored~ girlfriend Stella Maxwell this week. Stella, who is a freakin’ Victoria’s Secret angel , walked in the high-profile show alongside the Hadid sisters and Hailey Baldwin. Lady Gaga was there, too, and yes, she wore a new version of her cool catwoman face mask makeup from the Superbowl . More on that some other time.\nA photo posted by Just Jared Jr. (@justjaredjr) on Feb 7, 2017 at 9:13am PST \nThe actress, fresh off her f-bomb drop on this past weekend’s SNL, smiled and watched her girlfriend wow the crowd in a cropped red polo with patches and some stripey kickflares in blue stripes. The whole show was very ’90s Tommy reminiscent, which has got us reaching for our old makeup drawers to see if we still have a spritz of Tommy Girl left.\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images for Tommy Hilfiger The big buckle, the long blonde highlighted beach hair. Wait — were we supposed to keep that Tommy gear from 1996? Judging by the bandana and denim-banded wristwatch, the answer is yes.\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images for Tommy Hilfiger Kristen rolled up in a black fitted hoodie and some black skinnies (and a Sprite?), eager to let the spotlight be only on Stella. That’s the key to a great relationship, everybody. Balance!\ngotpap / Star Max / GC Images / Getty Images If you ask us, Kristen’s always had a type of chill Kate Mossian ’90s model vibe. She doesn’t give an eff about most things, and the ones she does give an eff about really truly matter. *cough* Stella, we think that’s you.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:29:08.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
