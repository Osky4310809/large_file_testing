Belo, publisher of The Dallas Morning News , has signed a 16-year lease that will move the newspaper from its longtime home at 508 Young Street to a modernized work space in the Old Dallas Central Library at the opposite end of downtown Dallas. \nSome information about the planned move was announced in October, but the lease was not formally signed until last week, said Katy Murray, chief financial officer of A.H. Belo. Dallas Morning News plans crosstown move to historic Statler Library redevelopment \nThe move reduces the space allotted to various departments of the news and marketing services company from about 325,000 square feet in two buildings near Union Station, to about 90,000 square feet adjacent to the Statler Hilton Hotel building. The former Dallas Public Library building is part of a two-building, $221 million redevelopment in downtown Dallas. The adjoining Statler Hilton hotel building is slated to reopen, along with residences and retail, in 2017. (Irwin Thompson/Staff Photographer) \nThe hotel is being refurbished by Centurion American Development Group, which also is in charge of the redevelopment of the old library at the corner of Commerce and Harwood streets. \nThe lease, which has the option of two renewal terms of five years each, starts rent free the first year, with the rent gradually increasing to $28 per square foot in year 16. \nMurray said she expects the move to take place over several months in the late spring and early summer. Some workers will move \"in a June-July time frame,\" while activity related to the relocation could begin as early as April. The company will christen the new space in April with a ceremony marking 175 years of media operations. The Dallas Morning News is a descendant of The Daily News of Galveston, which began publishing in April 1842.\nThe move to the Statler provides space for the roughly 500 employees who work at the main Morning News building and the adjacent TXCN building. \nBut Murray said the new offices will be designed so that some workers, particularly in sales, won't have a permanent assigned work space but will use communal spaces when in the office. \n\"There may be fewer dedicated work stations at the Statler because many of our [employees] work remotely and come into the office as needed,\" she said. \nThe company's news operations will occupy the first floor and mezzanine, in a configuration designed to improve collaboration between departments, Murray said. \n\"There are so many things we are doing to make this such a 2017 space,\" she said adding that the company is trying to create work spaces", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:49:38.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
