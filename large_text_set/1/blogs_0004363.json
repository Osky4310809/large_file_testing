Felicia confirmed that she's expecting a girl sometime this month in a baby-bump selfie, saying, \"She's coming in like three weeks so I guess I should announce this and stuff.\" After she announced the news, Supernatural costar Jared Padalecki chimed in on Twitter : \"WOOHOO!!! Do you think she'll like older men?!?! (My sons. Not me... Creepo.) #CONGRATS.\" Felicia is notoriously private about her personal life, so there currently isn't any information about whom (if anyone!) she's expecting a child with. In any event, we couldn't be more excited to see the little one come into the world.
