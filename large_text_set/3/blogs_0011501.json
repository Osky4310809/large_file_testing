Kelly was doing a live interview with BBC World News about South Korean politics on Friday, discussing the impeachment of President Park Geun Hye. I will be on @BBCNewsMedia / @BBCWorld in 10 minutes to talk about the Korean impeachment. â€” Robert E Kelly (@Robert_E_Kelly) March 10, 2017 Midway through the conversation, however, his two adorable kids enter the room. \nFirst, his daughter lets herself in. Kelly doesn't appear to notice until his interviewer says, \"I think one of your children just walked in ...\" \nThen Kelly's other kid enters the room in a walker followed quickly by his wife, who quickly escorts the kids out of the room and shuts the door. \nKelly remains calm throughout the interruption and apologizes before continuing to talk about South Korea's policies. \nSince the video was posted on March 10, it has quickly gone viral. The video has a staggering 83 million views on the Newsbeat Facebook page after only a few days. \nParents are writing how they understand Kelly's experience while non-parents have said that the moment has made them smile. \nOne commenter wrote on Facebook , \"I have laughed so hard on this. That little one in the walker is like 'WHERE'S DA PARTY AT?!!!' Cutest clip ever.\" \nAnother wrote , \"If this doesn't sum up having kids, I'm not sure what does! How funny! When the baby rolled in at the back in the munch mobile thing ... Got to love kids.\" Kelly also quickly realized that the video had the potential to go viral. \nThe BBC reported that when Kelly was asked for permission to share the sweet clip via Twitter, he asked, \"Is this kinda thing that goes 'viral' and gets weird?\" @David_Waddell What would that mean, please? Re-broadcasting it on BBC TV, or just here on Twitter? Is this kinda thing that goes 'viral' and gets weird?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:45:55.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
