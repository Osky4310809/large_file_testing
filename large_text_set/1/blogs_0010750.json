Advertisement \nIn a series of tweets published early Friday morning, they wrote: \n“We have taken the decision not to broadcast ‘Elizabeth, Michael & Marlon,’ a 30 minute episode from the Sky Arts Urban Myths series. This decision was taken in light of the concerns expressed by Michael Jackson’s immediate family. We set out to take a light-hearted look at reportedly true events & never intended to cause any offense. Joseph Fiennes fully supports our decision.” \nThough Paris Jackson has yet to comment publicly about the cancelation, she recently retweeted the a 20-year-old video of her father saying that he is “proud to be a black American,” and that he would not want a white child to portray him in a biopic: \nUrban Myths (sans Joseph Fiennes) premieres next week.
