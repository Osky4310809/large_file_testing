Many of them are part of working plantations and serve traditional cuisine, giving guests a unique dose of local culture. Deciding which one to pick can be difficult, as they're all so appealing. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. \nIn particular, homestays situated away from the main town (Madikeri) can be quite isolated and are best suited to people who prefer nature over traditional sightseeing. You'll need to have your own car to get around. Do also consider what type of homestay would be best suited to your needs. Some offer private cottages, while others are rooms in a home. Some even have attics, which are great for kids. Many don't have TVs. \nHere are 12 of the best Coorg homestays for all budgets to consider, in order of proximity to Madikeri town. Gowri Nivas 1. Gowri Nivas \nGowri Nivas is a delightfully transformed old ancestral property with a convenient town location, within walking distance of Raja's Seat -- one of the main attractions. The hosts aim to provide a luxurious stay at an affordable price. There are four uniquely decorated guest rooms, two in the main house and two cottage rooms. The cottage rooms are much quieter and private, and have lovely porches to sit out on. However, families with kids may prefer the room with an attic in the house. The hosts also have an estate, 40 kilometers from Madikeri at the foothills of Tadiyendamol, Coorg's highest peak. It's a peaceful place for a picnic.
