He was standing in the middle of a group of bodyguards, he grabbed my hand, he pulled me towards himself, and he asked, 'Who are you?' He asked in English. Then, I was so surprised, I'll tell you who it was in a moment, I was so surprised that I couldn't say anything except 'Hungary.'\" \nThe model then explained that Drumpf even went so far as to invite her to his hotel room, even though he'd been married to Melania Trump for about eight years at that point: \n\"He gave me his business card with his private number, and he told me in which hotel, which room he was staying in, and that his name is Donald Trump.\" \nThe gorgeous gal dished that she held on to that tiny piece of cardstock, adding: \n\"By the way, I still have the business card.\" \nIn fact, she even provided Hungarian tabloid Blikk with a photo of the business card in an interview this past November, saying: \n\"He's not my type.\" \nObviously, we can't verify the story, but Trump WAS there at that pageant. \nCh-ch-check out the clip (below) to hear Kata tell the story herself at about 5:51 (if you speak Hungarian, that is)! \nAre U surprised by Trump's alleged scumminess, Perezcious readers? \n[ Image via Donald Trump/Kata Sarka/ Instagram . ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:44:00.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
