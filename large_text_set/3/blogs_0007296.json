PA \nTube commuters were hit with rush hour delays on the Victoria line tonight after a person was taken ill on a train. \nThe busy Tube line was part suspended and some stations were reportedly closed after a passenger reportedly had a heart attack at Euston early on Wednesday evening. \nPassengers continued to be hit with severe delays in both directions even after it reopened at around 5pm. \nCommuters complained of Pimlico and Warren Street stations being shut while others were stuck on unmoving trains for 10 minutes as staff worked to get services up and running. \nPacked Tube trains were reportedly held at Vauxhall and Tottenham Hale while the line was suspended between Brixton and Kings Cross . An incident at Euston station led to severe delays on the entire line. (Getty Images) \nOne passenger, Michael Wynne, said he was on the train behind the Tube on which a passenger suffered a cardiac arrest. \nA spokesperson for the Victoria Line on Twitter said they could only start the service “once the passenger is safely in the hands of the London Ambulance Service”. \nGreater Anglia and the Stansted Express said they were accepting tickets between Tottenham Hale and Liverpool Street until 6pm. \nPassengers on the Northern line also faced disruption from the ill person at Euston, but services resumed without delays at around 5.15pm. \nAt around 6.20pm, the Victoria line reported there was now just minor delays and trains were running to Euston again. \nThe Victoria line had also been hit with a short power failure earlier on Wednesday.
