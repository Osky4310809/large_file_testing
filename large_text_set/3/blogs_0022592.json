The inquiries in Birmingham and other parts of the country are continuing,” Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations Mark Rowley told reporters outside London’s police headquarters on Thursday. \nRead more \nThe attack left four people dead, another 29 have been treated in hospitals, Rowley said, adding that seven people are now in critical condition. \nAccording to him, there is currently no information on further threats to the public. \nPolice say they know the identity of the attacker but have not made his name public yet. \nAccording to Mark Rowley, the victims are of different nationalities, but he did not specify. One of the four people killed is a policeman who was stabbed by the assailant. Two are pedestrians, a woman in her 40s, and a man in his 50s. The fourth is the attacker himself. \nUK Defense Minister Michael Fallon said on Thursday that the attack may be related to Islamic terrorism in some form. \n“The police are investigating this man, his associates, where he came from. [They are] checking urgently whether other people were involved in this. Their working assumption is that this is linked to Islamic terrorism, ” Fallon told BBC Radio on Thursday. He also stated that security around the UK Parliament will be reviewed. \nThe attack on Wednesday started when the assailant rammed pedestrians while speeding across Westminster Bridge in a car. He then ran towards Parliament and stabbed a policeman attempting to block him, before being shot. \nVia RT .
