Jones, 33, was arrested at a hotel near the Bengals’ stadium and the city’s entertainment district in downtown Cincinnati and booked in the jail at approximately 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. He faces misdemeanor charges of assault, disorderly conduct and obstructing official business, and a felony count of harassment with a bodily substance. \nAt his court hearing, where his bond was set at $37,500, public defender Lauren Staley “vehemently” denied all charges and said that he has witnesses to counter the allegations. Staley said Jones will hire an attorney. When arrested, Jones refused to enter the police car and allegedly pulled away before kicking and head-butting an officer, jail documents said. He then spit on the hand of a nurse while he was being booked into the Hamilton County Justice Center. The Bengals on Tuesday said they’re aware of the situation and are working to gather information, but are following team policy not to comment on unresolved legal matters. \nWe can officially call Adam Jones “Pacman Jones” again, right? I know we had this new Adam Jones that stayed out of trouble and didn’t do stupid shit. But I think once you pull out three of the dirtiest fight moves in the game, you officially get moved back into Pacman territory. If you poke someone in the eye, head-butt someone, or kick someone, you are an asshole. But if you do all three AND spit on a nurse, you immediately get your degenerate nickname slapped back on you. No ifs ands or maybes about it. All that was missing from that rap sheet was a fish hook and you have a dirty fight BINGO. \nAnd to be honest, I kind of like it. The NFL and the world needs its villains. Pacman got his time out of the spotlight by throwing on the Adam Jones moniker. But now it’s time to put the black hat back on and be the villain we all deserve. Maybe try to avoid being involved in situations with guns that leave people paralyzed. But still act like a huge asshole and embrace that Pacman persona.
