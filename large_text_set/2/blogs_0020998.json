Columbus scored three times in the first period, chasing New York goalie Thomas Greiss. \nDavid Savard had a goal and three assists, Boone Jenner and Jack Johnson also scored and backup goaltender Joonas Korpisalo stopped all 24 shots for the Blue Jackets, who ended New York’s three-game winning streak. Columbus has a comfortable hold on the top wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference, while the Islanders are in a tight race for the final playoff berth. \nGreiss stopped 14 of 17 shots in the first period. His replacement, Jean-Francois Berube, saved 24 of 28. \nJohnson got Columbus started when his shot from the point bounced off the skate of New York’s Nick Leddy and through Greiss’ pads 5:19 into the game. \nLater in the first period, Cam Atkinson’s shot from the left circle was stopped by Greiss, but the rebound trickled back out from between his legs and a charging Jenner tapped it in. \nFoligno capped the first-period barrage when he deked the goalie and scored on a backhand. \nThe Blue Jackets outshot the Islanders 17-9 in the period, leading to Greiss’ benching. \nAnderson kept it going 4:31 into the second with a sharp one-timer from the high slot off Jenner’s pass. Late in the period, Anderson got another one when he picked the pocket of defender Thomas Hickey in the neutral zone and launched a rocket past Berube from the right circle. \nThe highlight-reel goals continued in the third period when an airborne pass from Savard found Foligno for a breakaway 6:06 in. Savard got the seventh goal with 6 minutes left. \nNOTES: Columbus was without forward Matt Calvert and center Lukas Sedlak. Both have oblique strains. Recalled from Cleveland of the American Hockey League were Korpisalo and forward Markus Hannikainen. … New York forward Cal Clutterbuck was out with an injury for the 15th time in 20 games. D Adam Pelech also was scratched. … Columbus completed a seven-game homestand, its longest of the season. … Savard got his 100th career point with an assist on Johnson’s first-period goal. … New York is 2-1-0 during a stretch of nine straight road games. \nUP NEXT \nIslanders: At the Dallas Stars on Thursday night. \nBlue Jackets: At the New York Rangers on Sunday. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:09:25.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
