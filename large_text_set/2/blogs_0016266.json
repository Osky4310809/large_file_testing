If it were a bet, you wouldn’t take it.” So says The Player in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard ’s absurdist comedy about what happens in the wings of a production of Hamlet. This week a 50th anniversary of the production opens at the Old Vic , with Joshua McGuire and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe making up the infamous double act. The boy who lived will now be asking the meaning of life. In 1966, Stoppard returned from debuting the play at Edinburgh Fringe to find a telegram from National Theatre literary manager Kenneth Tynan, asking for a copy of the script. After a successful production there, it transferred to Broadway, and made Stoppard’s name. Some critics asked what on earth it was all about. “It’s about to make me very rich,” replied Stoppard. Ahead of Radcliffe and McGuire’s cerebral stage shenanigans, here’s a reminder of some of the most noteworthy pairings the play has had previously. Edward Petherbridge and John Stride John Stride as Rosencrantz and Edward Petherbridge as Guildenstern (Anthony Crickmay/National Theatre Archive) This pair originated the roles at the National Theatre in 1967, after Tynan got wind of the play at the Edinburgh Fringe. Directed by Derek Goldby, it was the only piece of new writing in the season, and the gamble paid off. A telegram from ecstatic American producer to Laurence Olivier said ‘Please do everything you can to get it for me STOP Terms no object STOP You fellows can write your own ticket STOP’. Gary Oldman and Tim Roth The film rights for the play were bought for $350,000 in 1968, but the film didn’t emerge until 1990, directed by Stoppard himself. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and Oldman, as Rosencrantz, was particularly acclaimed for his performance. Simon Russell Beale and Adrian Scarborough Adrian Scarborough as Rosencrantz and Simon Russell Beale as Guildenstern (Robert Workman/National Theatre Archive) These stage stalwarts took on the roles in 1996, when the play was revived at the National Theatre. This pair made the production “exuberantly funny as any I have seen” according to critic Michael Billington. They were reunited in a 2014 production of King Lear at the National Theatre. Jamie Parker and Samuel Barnett Jamie Parker as Guildenstern, Samuel Barnett as Rosencrantz (Catherine Ashmore) These two original History Boys starred in Sir Trevor Nunn’s revival at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2011; Tim Curry was set to star as The Player but had to withdraw for health reasons. The show ended up transferring to the Royal Haymarket in London's West End, and the already-close actors were praised for their chemistry. It was a great chance for their fans to seem them reunited on stage – there's even a Tumblr dedicated to their friendship ( barnettandparkertweets.tumblr.com ). Benedict Cumberbatch and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith This production never actually happened, but after this snippet, many wished that it did. The two actors performed a scene from the play as part of the National Theatre’s 50th anniversary celebrations, with Cumberbatch delivering the brilliant line: “Eternity is a terrible thought. When is it going to end?” \nRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is at the Old Vic, February 26 - April 29. It will be broadcast live from the Old Vic on April 20 as part of National Theatre Live.
