Her classmate, a science topper, couldn’t explain the connection between H2O and water. \nIn 2015, parents and relatives of students in Hajipur district were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answers. The embarrassed state government had announced tough measures like fines and jail terms, intended to curb cheating.
