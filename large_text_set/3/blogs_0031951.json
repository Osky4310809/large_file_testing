There they met Iraqis who had fled their own conflicts, creating powder keg conditions. \n“WikiLeaks revealed the internal conversations in the Syrian government where they were saying to one another, ‘We can’t handle this, there’s going to be a social explosion,’” Gore said. “There are other causes of the Syrian civil war, but this was the principal one.” \nThe resulting war brought more refugees into Europe, which inevitably caused political instability and helped convince many in the U.K. to vote to leave the European Union.   \n“This collision between the power of industrial civilization and the surprising fragility of the earth’s ecosystem now poses a great danger that could even threaten the future of human civilization itself,” Gore said, according to the U.K. Express. \nWhile Syria is in the midst of a horrible drought, it’s far from unprecedented. Desert regions have experienced droughts for ages, but that doesn’t necessarily impact the political decisions made by people thousands of miles away. \nBrexit was a political decision voters made on the basis of things other than the weather — things like getting out from under ridiculous laws and taxes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:02:06.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
