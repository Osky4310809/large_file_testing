Most Popular By Jack Holmes Mar 13, 2017 Welcome to Whose Lie Is it Anyway ? , the show where everything's made up and the facts don't matter. On today's episode, Special Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway displayed her spectacular disregard for objective reality during a round of interviews on the morning shows. First up: Conway's appearance on the TODAY Show , in which Matt Lauer asked her why the Labor Department's monthly jobs report—which President Trump derided throughout the campaign as fake and rigged—is suddenly true and good:   “There’s a lot of fakery going on for people who were promised something that never came to be.”- @KellyannePolls https://t.co/h78lvoYvZS \n— TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 13, 2017 Most Popular Conway paid even less lip service to the question than usual. She executed the classic Conway Twist by latching onto a single term in the question (\"fake\"), repeating it, then launching into a diatribe about other \"fakery\" in which President Obama engaged with regard to health care. Remember when we were talking about the jobs report? Elsewhere, Conway jumped on CNN's New Day , where she was forced to explain some mysterious comments about wiretapping she made in an interview with New Jersey newspaper The Record . \"What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,\" Conway told the paper this weekend. \"You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television set—any number of ways.\" She also mentioned \"microwaves that turn into cameras,\" adding: \"We know this is a fact of modern life.\" Obviously, the folks on CNN were interested in some clarification: Having claimed she was talking about \"surveillance generally,\" this is a real thing she said: \"I'm not Inspector Gadget. I don't believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign. However, I'm not in the job of having evidence. That's what investigations are for.\" Yes, she's in the job of making completely unfounded claims. \"I'm not Inspector Gadget\": It's like \"I'm not a scientist,\" but for when you're accusing a former president of a felony.
