But the good guy, in what I’ve seen happen so far, the good usually wins. That’s why I’m not afraid of a Trump presidency.” \nBut could Trump even stay in power longer than two terms? Not without some drastic changes. \nThe Twenty-Second Amendment of the Constitution allows for an America president to serve two terms in office, which would come to eight years. The last — and only — president to serve more than that was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was elected to the Oval Office four times. This was before the amendment was introduced in 1947. \nShould Chance be worried? In order to change the Constitution, there must be approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate — and the Republicans aren’t close to having that many seats in either. \nHowever, the Constitution can also be amended by a constitutional congress called by two-thirds of state legislatures. On this front, the Republicans are just one legislature short, currently holding 32 of 50. Given the amount of Republicans who are skeptical of Trump’s policies, behavior and attitude toward Russia though, it doesn’t seem at all likely that they would break with democratic norms in order to make sure Trump stays in Washington DC into his eighties — especially when you remember that there’s a bunch of them who would like to be president themselves.
