The third came eight minutes before the break when Kane’s free-kick was diverted past Stoke keeper Lee Grant. \nKane then raced clear to set up Dele Alli for his 14th of the season in first-half injury time. \nBoss Mauricio Pochettino did suffer an injury setback, however, with both his first-choice defenders, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, forced off in the second half through injury. 1. Kane shows his class Kane completes his hat-trick (Photo: Michael Regan) \nEvery top side has one and for Spurs it is Harry Kane. The north Londoners’ high-class marksman was at his predatory best to wipe out Stoke single-handedly. \nThe first of those goals, in his 36-minute hat-trick, was the 100th of his career. He could have had another too. The effort he curled goalwards in the 27th-minute flew only narrowly wide. \nHe tracked back, he foraged out wide and of course he set up Dele Alli - all before his half-time orange. His was not just a man of the match display because of the goals. \nKane earned the match ball because of a performance of the highest class. Still only 23 and having played only 219 matches, Spurs have produced a potentially world class striker with his best years ahead of him. 2. Poch keeps faith with Europa flops Spurs responded well to their Europa League exit (Photo: REUTERS) \nMauricio Pochettino sent out exactly the same side as the one that crashed out of the Europa League last Thursday night against mid-table Belgian side Gent. \nThe feeling from the Argentine was clearly that he wanted his men to get the frustration out of their system. From the outset it was clear that even he meant business, prowling his technical area to keep his men up to their work. \nBerating them for every misplaced pass. Turning angrily and cursing in frustration as no Spurs player made it to Eriksen’s tantalising ball across the six-yard box. \nThe message got through to the players with Kane exorcising the memory of his misses at Wembley and leaving Stoke in pieces. 3. Crouch's return can't stop Spurs Crouch returned to White Hart Lane (Photo: Bryn Lennon) \nThe man who shot Spurs into the Champions League seven years ago was not about to deny his former club a return to the top table here. \nCrouch had come back to White Hart Lane in fine form, boasting four goals in his previous eight games. \nFor all the threat that he posed, however, he was kept largely quiet by Toby Alderweireld who jockeyed him intelligently with Jan Vertonghen as cover. \nIn fact, so comfortable were Spurs against the big man, Vertonghen even had time to hit the crossbar with a right-footed effort in the 26th-minute. 4. Eriksen proves his worth Eriksen was impressive (Photo: Michael Regan) \nHe has often been criticised - sometimes even by Pochettino - for not imposing himself on matches. But Eriksen of late has been terrific. This game was the latest in a sequence in which he has made himself too hot to handle. \nIt was his ball across the six-yard box in the fifth minute that simply cried out to be touched in. It was Eriksen trying to control the ball in the box for the opener before Kane rammed it in. \nIt was from Eriksen’s corner that Kane volleyed in his second. And although he Dane only rolled the ball to Kane for that deflected third, Eriksen will take that as an assist. \nA fine day at the office for a man enjoying quite a few at the moment. 5. Hughes will be fuming Hughes will be angry (Photo: Bryn Lennon) \nThe Stoke boss must be sick of the sight of Spurs. That’s now eight goals in two games this season with the second four scored during a remarkably easy first half of this contest. \nHad Jan Vertonghen not hit the bar and Harry Kane not curled an effort wide it could have been 6-0 by half time. \nYes, the Potters are still making the evolution from the pragmatic, long-ball outfit they were under Tony Pulis into the passing side that Hughes eventually wants them to be. \nThat said, Hughes was right to be fuming with his flops here. Spurs have played three times since Stoke were last in action. \nHughes’ squad have been in Dubai for a spot of warm weather training. They were clearly still in their flip-flops here and were punished accordingly. poll loading Will Tottenham finish in the top four? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T18:02:20.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
