He's even managed to antagonize people in the hood. While he makes headlines almost every day like it's his side job, the Mississippi rapper also crafts some diss tracks once in a while. \nMonday he released a catchy new anthem aimed at Mike Tyson, 50 Cent , Quavo and Chris Brown . \"Stop Playing With Me\" uses excerpts from his infamous DJ Vlad interview -- \" you knew who it was ? \" -- and his perennial hit \"Crank That\" over one of his patented beats. He subtly threatens his enemies over and over again with his past exploits stopping a home invasion with a draco, and reminding you he's making more money than you'll ever see in your lifetime. \nQuotable Lyrics \nMike Tyson, knock out his teethChris Brown, knock out his teethBoy stop playing with me50 stop playing with meYou know that I love the beefImma spend 50 today (skrrt)I hop in a Lambo, escape (skrrt)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:18:16.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
