The Center for Consumer Freedom operates Humane Watch, an organization that targets not-for-profit animal welfare organizations as well as celebrities who speak out against cruelty. While they say their interest lies in protecting what they call consumer freedom to make choices for ourselves, one of their goals is to take down the Humane Society of the United States and PETA by handpicking skewed information. CCF has over 20 spin off sites created to attack not-for-profit animal welfare, environmental, health and other organizations working for the greater good. (Source: Sourcewatch)We believe this commercial is inappropriate, damaging and very misleading. They are a direct supporter of large scale dog breeding facilities (puppy mills) who perpetrate animal cruelty, suffering and death. Please remove this commercial from the line up for Sunday's Super Bowl.
