He did not feel the need to set that all out again. \nQ: Are you as worried as you were then? Then you talked of uncertainty, and a rollercoaster. \nHammond says there is less uncertainty now after Theresa May’s Lancaster House speech. That has been “a huge step forward”. Share \nQ: In 2015 you said you would run a surplus. Your figures show that you will not be able to do that in this parliament. \nHammond says circumstances have changed. You have to deal with the world as it is. \nHe could have kept to the deficit reduction pledge, but that would have squeezed the economy in a harmful way. \nQ; You also broke your promise to keep the UK in the single market. \nHammond says the decision to leave the EU has changed the game. \nQ: Only because of a referendum your party chose to hold. It could have foreseen a vote to leave. \nHammond says the government kept its promise to hold a referendum. \nWe now have to negotiate the best possible deal. Share \nQ: Would you put NICs up again for the self-employed? \nHammond says he has got the system into a better place. \nNo chancellor can ever rule out future tax changes. \nQ: Your backbenchers says you need to think again. Will you listen? \nHammond says he has introduced this measure because he needed to raise revenue in this budget. \nHe had to put money into social care. \nNo Conservative likes to raise taxes, he says. \nHe has decided to make the national insurance system “a little bit fairer”. But the self-employed still pay less. Share \nHammond says he faces extremely challenging circumstances. \nQ: You could use that as a reason for admitting you have not kept your promise? \nHammond ignores the point, and goes on to say he is making the UK match-fit for Brexit. \nHe put £2.5bn into health and social care, he says. \nAnd he committed to a radical change in the way technical education is delivered. \nQ: You have said circumstances have changed, even if you do not admit breaking a promise. Has white van man paid the price for voting for Brexit? \nNo, says Hammond. \nQ: What other circumstance has changed then, if not Brexit? \nHammond says the way the state pension is being paid has changed, helping the self-employed. \nQ: You knew that before the election. \nHammond ignores the point, and goes on to say he wanted to close the gap between the way the employed and the self-employed are taxed. Share Philip Hammond's Today interview \nPhilip Hammond is being interviewed by Nick Robinson on the Today programme now. \nHammond says the government legislated to implement their “tax lock” manifesto commitment. The legislation made it clear that the promise covered class 1 NICs. \nQ: But the manifesto says repeatedly that national insurance contributions would not rise. Was there small print saying you only meant some NICs? \nHammond says Labour was putting forward a plan for wide-ranging tax increases. \nHe says 60% of self-employed people will see a reduction in NICs. Anyone earning less than £16,250 will pay less. \nQ: Will you apologise for saying something during the election and then unsaying? \nHammond said the Tories then passed legislation. \nQ: But do you accept what the party said was untrue? \nHammond says the party explained when it legislated for the tax lock what it meant. At that point people could have queried what the party meant. But Labour did not. Rebecca Long-Bailey, then the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the bill delivered the Tory manifesto. Share 08:10 \nIt is the day after the budget and, as is usual, the chancellor is out giving interviews. With Conservative MPs, and, perhaps just as importantly, Tory MPs, furious about the increase in national insurance contributions (NICs), Philip Hammond has a tough job. \nOn ITV earlier this is how he defended his decision to break a Conservative manifesto promise. \nBritain’s circumstances have moved on. \nWe are now facing the challenge of leaving the European Union, of building a global Britain to exploit the opportunities in the future that this country can enjoy, and we need to invest to do that. \nI’ve had to ask the self-employed to pay a little bit more National Insurance in order to make a fair contribution for the services that they receive from government. \nHe is about to be interviewed on the Today programme. I will be covering that in full, as well as summarising everything he and John McDonnell , the shadow chancellor, have said in their morning interviews. \nThen, at 1pm, the Institute for Fiscal Studies will give its verdict on the budget. \nHere is the Guardian’s main overnight budget story.
