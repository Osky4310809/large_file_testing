Liverpool 2-1 Burnley \n\"I read in newspapers it was about money, but it isn't about money,\" he said. \"We've had a few good meetings and everything is fine. I just wanted to say it is never about the money. It is about the future, what happens. \n\"You never know what will happen in football, but I am happy here. We will speak in the next few weeks and months and see what happens. \n\"The meetings are with my agent, but I am very happy at Liverpool. In the future I can play for many years at Liverpool.\" Can says he is happy at Liverpool \nCan was Liverpool's match-winner against Burnley on Super Sunday, with a long-range strike securing a 2-1 victory . \nThe midfielder has struggled to hit top form this season but says that has been more to do with physical issues than contractual ones. \nWhen asked whether the uncertainty over his future had affected his performances, Can said: \"No, that was not the reason. The last few months the most important thing has been that I am pain-free and we have spoken more about that than the contract. Can says he has struggled with calf problems \n\"I've had calf problems for many years and it has been very difficult for me - 10 minutes into the game I've not been able to feel my feet in a few games - but I didn't like to go to the press and say, 'I am injured'. \n\"Maybe it was not good that I played and did not have a break. I didn't play well when it was my opportunity to play and it was my mistake. I play in a different position now and I don't sprint too much.
