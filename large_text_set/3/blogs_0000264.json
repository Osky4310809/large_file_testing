He'd have looked different in red (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nAnd in a new interview with Four Four Two magazine , Duff has lifted the lid on just how close he came to joining Liverpool, and how he never really wanted to join Spurs. \n\"I came close [to Liverpool] two or three times,\" he said. \"The first was a year or two before I signed for Chelsea. I would have gone there, but Blackburn wanted a big fee so not too many clubs could afford to buy me back then! When I was leaving Chelsea, the same move nearly happened again.\" Duff could have been playing with Xabi Alonso, not against him (Photo: Press Association) \nAnd then when Spurs came calling, it never really occurred to him to go. \n\"I remember getting a message from (then Spurs boss) Martin Jol,\" he continued, \"but I was a Chelsea fan after winning titles there so it was something I never really looked at.\" Beat them, then join them (Photo: Reuters) \nDuff won two Premier League titles and the League Cup under Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge, before moving on to Newcastle in 2006. \nThat Liverpool move never happened for him though, and he clearly didn't want the Spurs one. \n-- \nRead the full interview in the new issue of Four Four Two magazine, out now Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T20:15:12.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
