Down in Westminster, just heard what sounded like an explosion. Not sure what happened though. Police said they were dealing w/ new incident \n— Paul Abernethy (@paul_abo) March 23, 2017 \nThe incident was unfolding while mourners gathered for a vigil in London’s Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening, following a terrorist attack outside the British Parliament a day earlier. \nThere have been reports in the media suggesting police carried out a controlled explosion on the package, but a Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment on that, Reuters reported. \nHe said police were investigating the package found near Westminster. \nPolice later said what had been found was merely an “ unattended bag ” and lifted security cordons. Unattended bag found Birdcage Walk/Horseguards was not suspicious. All cordons put in for safety being lifted. Thanks for your patience. \n— Westminster Police (@MPSWestminster) March 23, 2017 \nOn Wednesday, a man later identified by police as Khalid Masood, 52, launched an attack in central London, first ramming a car into people on Westminster Bridge, and then stabbing a police officer by the gates of the Houses of Parliament. Four people were killed and about 40 injured, with Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) claiming responsibility for the attack. \nVia RT .
