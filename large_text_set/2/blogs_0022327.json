And it came back to bite him ‚Ä¶ in the form of one of the most vicious Twitter burns in sports history. \nDuring a foul shot in the Warriors-Clippers game, Green started yapping at the 39-year-old Pierce, who is serving a small-time role on the Clippers in his final NBA season. \nIn audio picked up on the TV broadcast, Green said to Pierce: \n‚ÄúChasing that farewell tour. They don‚Äôt love you like that! You can‚Äôt get no farewell tour. They don‚Äôt love you like that. You ain‚Äôt got that type of love. You thought you was Kobe?‚Äù \nThat‚Äôs some decent trash talk, as far as trash-talking a future Hall of Famer in his final season goes.
