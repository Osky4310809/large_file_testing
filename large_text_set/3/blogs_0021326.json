Antoine Griezmann, the France international frequently linked with a summer move to United, was clean through with his team leading 1-0, but just when it seemed easier to score, he somehow thrashed the ball wide. \nGiven United's struggles in the final third of this season, it was the kind of frustrating finishing that made one feel as though he had already sealed a move to Old Trafford. \nAs the current campaign rumbles to a close, many of United's supporters are comforting themselves with one particular mantra: All the club needs to do this summer is buy the right forwards, and the attack will begin to fire. Yet this analysis overlooks the systemic flaws in United's front line. Put simply, a team assembled from the talents of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Paul Pogba, Juan Mata, Anthony Martial, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcus Rashford should have managed far more than 42 goals in 27 Premier League matches. \nThat's only two more than West Ham United, a club the departing Dmitri Payet criticised as being too defensive. United have the same goal tally as Bournemouth and only three more than West Bromwich Albion, despite having spent many multiples more on their strikers. \nIt is absolutely true that had United's strikers put away some very presentable opportunities, they'd have fired their club higher than fifth position. But their issues have been so pronounced that it's fair to wonder if some of these players are losing their edge. Marcus Rashford looked lethal at certain points last season but now seems a fraction less decisive. Anthony Martial could be trusted to deliver the moment he stepped on the field, but too many games tucked out on the flank have made him more of a winger than an endless goal threat. Man United did beat Middlesbrough on Sunday but needed goals from midfield given the attack's inconsistency. \nIn this context, it seems complacent to assume that should Griezmann arrive at Old Trafford (a transfer that now is by no means certain), the goals will begin to flow. One reason Zlatan Ibrahimovic has managed to avoid the goal drought of his fellow strikers is that the attack is built around his particular strengths; with most of the others, it's not quite the case. Mkhitaryan has performed well enough but would benefit even more from a team that moved the ball at greater pace in and around the box. Too often, United's forward play this season has seemed far more pedestrian than that of their close rivals. \nThere have been games in which United have managed the type of intensity that unsettles the very best defenses, most recently in the first half of the FA Cup tie against Chelsea, but they didn't manage it without a steep rise in aggression, a rise that, of course, led to the dismissal of Ander Herrera. For United to flourish, the answer will not merely be to add new personnel. At the moment, their efforts in the final third seem strangely lopsided and lacking in speed when it matters most. This is all the more odd given that in Mkhitaryan, Martial and Rashford, they have three of the quickest forwards anywhere in Europe. \nA problem here is partly that neither Mata nor Ibrahimovic are all that quick. A graver issue, though, is that United's passing combinations look sluggish against deep-lying defences, with the team unable to pass through the lines at crucial moments. To draw a sharp contrast, it was revealing to watch Barcelona dismantling Valencia 4-2 at the weekend, a game in which even their centre-backs (most notably, Samuel Umtiti and Javier Mascherano) were playing dangerous passes behind opposing full-backs. \nTo achieve something similar, Jose Mourinho must take more risks. Not only must he buy central defenders who are more accomplished ballplayers than those he currently has (Chris Smalling and Phil Jones spring most swiftly to mind), but he must also strike a better balance between allowing his players to improvise in the final third and giving them better ways to break down the division's cannier back lines. \nIn 2013, United's most recent title-winning season, Robin van Persie credited Rene Meulensteen, then a coach at the club, with such methods. Meulensteen himself spoke of the need to \"set up traps\" for the opposition, something at which he was spectacularly effective that year. Perhaps, as the Mourinho era rolls on at Old Trafford, he will usefully begin to embrace some of those old nuances again. \nMusa Okwonga is one of ESPN FC's Manchester United bloggers.
