Jenna Bush Hager, Carson Daly, Al Roker and Brian Gumbel were all shocked — most to tears.\n“That little girl, Haley Joy,” said Kotb, her voice clearly breaking, “is my daughter. I adopted her.”\nLater Kotb, who also co-hosts the fourth hour of “Today” with Gifford, called into that program to gush more about the newest addition to her family.\n“Can you believe? I have a daughter,” said Kotb.\n“I didn’t know that my heart can feel like this,” she added. “With all the love I’ve ever had in my life, and I’ve had the best love … I never ever imagined that I could feel this kind of … it’s like a warm hand on my heart.”\nThen Gifford started crying again.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hodakotb", "https://twitter.com/@helena_andrews", "https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/834028518036086785"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:33:05.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
