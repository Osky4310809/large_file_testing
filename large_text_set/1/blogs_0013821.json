It was a pity, because our goal was the three points, obviously. \n“Perhaps we didn’t see the best football but it was a thrilling game full of rivalry. \n“All we have to think about now is starting over and trying to win the next game. The team showed pride until the end, and Old Trafford fought with us, as always.” \nUnited are next in action away at Stoke City on Saturday. \nThey will make that trip sat sixth in the Premier League standings, four points adrift of Arsenal in the final Champions League spot.
