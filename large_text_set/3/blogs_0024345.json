All you need is a wall (or a friend who's literally got your back) to get your glutes firing and on that road to high and tight!\" \nThe first step is to position yourself as if you were sitting on an invisible chair.\n\"Lean against a wall, or ask a friend to prop you up using their body weight... Position yourself so your thighs are parallel to the floor, as if you were sitting in a chair. Make sure your weight is in your heels, and don't let those knees creep out past your toes!\" \nThen, hold this stance for as long as you can!\n\"Hold for at least 15 seconds. Work your way up to one minute as you get stronger! For an extra challenge, hold weights in either hand or on your lap. (Anything heavy works!) This might look easy but, honey, 'sitting' has never been so hard!!!\"' \nTime to hit the gym! \n[ Image via Khloé Kardashian . ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:14:56.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
