Press Trust of India Boston Unlike earlier when a leisurely life was representative of high status, today displaying how busy you are at work is seen as a sign of social status.(Shutterstock) \nHumblebragging or boasting about how hectic your life is may be the new status symbol, according to Harvard researchers. \nResearchers found that being seen as constantly busy and overworked is the new way to prove that one is ‘in demand’. Taking the afternoon off for a round of golf or enjoying a beach holiday in a five-star resort were once signs of having social capital. \nHowever, phrases such as “I have no life” and “I desperately need a holiday” are now used to imply social standing, researchers said.

The study found that brands that marketed themselves as time-saving were becoming increasingly high-status, because of the people who used them.

However, in Italy the effect was completely reversed. Italians still view a leisurely life as representative of high status, researchers said. \nThe study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research. \nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:18:12.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
