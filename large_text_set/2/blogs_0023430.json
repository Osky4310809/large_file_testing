Don't be late for a practice session or a lesson. Make sure your hair is away from your face and that your clothes are appropriate for ice skating. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Best Basketball Players of All Time Figure Skaters Should Take Good Care of Their Skates.

Wear skate guards until you step onto the ice. Make sure the blades are completely dry after a practice session. Take the time to wipe the blades thoroughly and carefully cover the blades with soakers. Don't leave blades inside wet skate guards. Put your skates away neatly in your skate bag after a practice session. Make sure your blades are kept sharp and polish your boots on a regular basis. Be tidy. Keep the area where you take your skates on and off free from clutter. Hero Images / Hero Images Collection / Getty Images 3. Respect Your Figure Skating Coach Keep in mind that figure skating coaches have spent years becoming experts in the sport. They work hard and need respect from both skaters and their parents. Be on time for lessons. Listen to what your coach suggests and teaches. Try to practice and improve between each lesson. Trust your coach. Figure Skaters Should Support One Another.

Respect Other Skaters Always remember that there are many skaters of all ages and skating levels at an ice rink, so encourage newer and younger skaters. Don't get angry if a skater accidently gets in your way, but also try to keep out of a skater's way. Keep in mind that a skater doing his or her program has the right of way. Give praise to other skaters when you see improvement in their skating. Don't be jealous of others. A Young Ice Skater Attempts Forward Swizzles.

Take the time to thank your parents for giving you skating. Don't get angry with your parents at the rink. Appreciate the fact that your parents have taken the time to buy you skates, drive you to the rink, and take you to competitions. Appreciate the hours your mom or dad sits in a cold ice arena watching you skate. Thank your parents for paying for expensive figure skating lessons. Figure Skating.

Don't ever stand in the middle of the ice chatting. Work hard to improve at something during every practice sesssion. Plan your practice sessions in advance.

Don't Skip Practices or Lessons It is okay to take a week off from skating once in awhile, but it is not okay to miss practices and lessons on a regular basis. Remember that your coach expects you to be at the rink and reserves a lesson time slot just for you. Missing practices too often will mean that you will not improve at figure skating, so be consistent and set a practice and lesson schedule and stick to it. Beginning Ice Skaters.

Don't Show Emotion on the Ice Many skaters cry or get angry when they have a \"bad day\" on the ice, but it is best to not exhibit emotion in public. Skaters should not kick the ice or get angry if they miss a jump or mess up a spin. Skaters should not cry after a bad fall . If you can't control your emotion, it is best to go into a private area in the rink, such as a locker room or restroom. The main thing to remember is to not show emotion in public.

Do your homework on time and don't miss school because of skating . Read. Take part in other hobbies, sports, and interests. Appreciate art and music. Take ballet and dance classes. Be a well-balanced person. Try to not watch too much TV or spend too many hours playing video games.
