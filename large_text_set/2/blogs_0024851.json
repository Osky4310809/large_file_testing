File photo ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — Security forces are scouring possible locations in Sulu for the remains of a German who was reportedly beheaded Sunday afternoon by the Abu Sayyaf. This, as the military said it has not received any confirmation yet on the ground pending search of the body of 70-year-old Juergen Gustav Kantner. Col. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said forces on the ground are relentlessly working to confirm the reports, according to Western Mindanao Command spokesperson Capt. Jo-Ann Petinglay. According to intelligence reports, Abu Sayyaf militants led by sub-leader Muamar Askali—alias Abu Rami—executed Kantner Sunday afternoon in the vicinity of Barangay Buanza, Indanan town, Sulu. The Abu Sayyaf had demanded a ransom of P30 million for Kantner's release. The military are coordinating with the Moro National Liberation Front to verify reports since Barangay Buanza is a known MNLF area. “As of now, we have not received confirmation on the ground but we continue on checking to verify the reports,” Petinglay said. Security has been raised in Indanan town and authorities believe the heavy presence of security forces might have prevented the Abu Sayyaf from slipping the remains out and leaving the in Jolo, the capital town. The Abu Sayyaf militants previously dumped captives' remains there as a warning. Petinglay said the reported beheading has not slowed down operations to crush the Abu Sayyaf and rescue all the remaining hostages. “With or without the dead our focused military operations is ongoing against all targets to search and rescue the hostages,” Petinglay said. At least 14 battalions of soldiers have been running after the Abu Sayyaf militants with orders to rescue the hostages. Petinglay said the Abu Sayyaf militants are holding 20 foreigners and seven locals captive in Sulu. The Abu Sayyaf abducted six Vietnamese off Taganak Island, Tawi-Tawi last week but there has been no confirmation that the latest victims have been brought to Sulu.
