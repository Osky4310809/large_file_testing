Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC.\n(Seriously).\n— Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017 \n\nAlmost immediately, speculation flew about which tax returns they might be and what information Rachel had about Trump’s finances. If the information truly contained a huge bombshell, why wasn’t MSNBC going live with the report? Could this actually be what turns some of Trump’s base away from him after all these months? What would the White House response be after the fact? \nOf course, even with all those questions swirling Twitter was having a ball with jokes and pop culture references as they anticipated the report. \n(watch ‘em be Tiffany’s) https://t.co/7TgANEJuRS \n— Ryan Nanni (@celebrityhottub) March 14, 2017 \nwut https://t.co/LdonTugvc7 \n— Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) March 14, 2017 \nif it's nothing, twitter is going to be insufferable. if it's something, also that.\n— Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) March 15, 2017 \nthat @maddow tweet… pic.twitter.com/pRQEKPFdDr \n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes) March 14, 2017 \nThe returns say 'Emma Stone, La La Land'\n— (((Josh))) (@Tyrangiel) March 15, 2017 \nreally could’ve used this during the Bachelor finale Rach https://t.co/LdEIrk40XD \n— Holly Anderson (@HollyAnderson) March 14, 2017 \nhas any body said omfg yet because\nomfg\n— darth™ (@darth) March 14, 2017 \n\nhttps://twitter.com/as_seenontv/status/841798661373796352 \nGotta play funkmaster flex bomb sound effects throughout tonight's show https://t.co/3e7bTIkk3j \n— Desus Nice (@desusnice) March 14, 2017 \n\n\nThere was even the requisite NBA trade news joke. \nWoj gonna leak those Trump tax returns at 8:58 pm\n— William Lou (@william_lou) March 14, 2017 \n\nThen, Maddow confirmed that the big tax return news only a few pages from POTUS’ 2005 returns and news started to leak about exactly how much Trump claimed in income that year. \nWhat we've got is from 2005… the President's 1040 form… details to come tonight 9PM ET, MSNBC.\n— Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 15, 2017 \nThree sources have told me the tax returns on Maddow tonight are 2005 tax returns and Trump reports 150 million in income.\n— Yashar (@yashar) March 15, 2017 \n\nThat didn’t stop the jokes though. Never put it past Twitter to take breaking news about potential tax return information, of all things, and make it hilarious. Or, actually, maybe Twitter’s only true purpose is to make waiting around for breaking tax return information (that could be super boring in the end) a worthwhile and funny activity.\nThe two attorneys in the room, always looking for the tax incentives @celebrityhottub @Brandon_Borders pic.twitter.com/JBCdqOi0hl \n— Bunkie Perkins (@BunkiePerkins) March 15, 2017 \ntrump furiously trying to ban television right now\n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 15, 2017 \nAbout 9:05 EST Ole Miss is going to confess to laundering millions through bullfighting rings.\n— Russ Bouchand (@texaninnyc) March 15, 2017 \nMe, showing up to the #TrumpTaxReturnParty pic.twitter.com/0mAIy3O1cD \n— Queer Rebel ⭐️ (@Neil_McNeil) March 15, 2017 \nMADDOW: And here to reveal Trump's taxes… Brian Williams?\nWILLIAMS: Here's what I saw as Trump's accountant…\n— Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) March 15, 2017 \n\n\nReturns, ranked:\n1.
