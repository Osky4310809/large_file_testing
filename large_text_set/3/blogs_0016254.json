So why not . . . board games?\nHasbro recently hooked up with Broadway’s Araca Group to exploit its cache of hugely popular games. First up is “Monopoly, the Musical” — though I was hoping for “Candy Land.” I’d love to see what a great set designer like David Rockwell would make of the Gumdrop Mountains, or how William Ivey Long would costume Lord Licorice (played, no doubt, by Patrick Page).\nAlas, our sugar high will have to wait, as we plunge into “Monopoly.”\nI hear Hasbro has hired Rick Elice to write the book and Dan Lipton and David Rossmer to do the score.\nElice, who with Marshall Brickman wrote “Jersey Boys,” has become the go-to musical theater man. He’s also at work on the Cher musical, as well as a half-dozen other shows.\nLipton and Rossmer are relative unknowns, though Lipton, a talented pianist, is one of the most sought-after accompanists on the concert circuit, performing with Kelli O’Hara and Judy Kuhn. On Broadway, he worked closely with Sting on “The Last Ship.”\nTogether they wrote “Rated P . . . for Parenthood,” which ran at the Westside Theatre a few years ago. Word is, Elice saw a workshop of their original piece “The Blonde Streak” and urged Hasbro to take a chance on them.\n“Monopoly, the Musical” won’t be about people playing a board game. Nor will the cast include a top hat, Scottie dog, racing car or newcomers T. rex, rubber ducky and penguin. (Thimble, wheelbarrow and boot recently parted ways with Monopoly due to “artistic differences.”)\nSources say the musical is a screwball comedy set in Atlantic City during the Depression. One of the main characters is Charles Darrow, who’s credited with inventing the game.\nDarrow grew up in Philadelphia and spent childhood summers on the Jersey Shore. He became a salesman in the 1920s, but lost his job after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. He spent his idle hours playing a game that creator Elizabeth Magie called the Landlord’s Game. He tweaked it into Monopoly and shrewdly acquired the patent, eventually selling it to Parker Brothers for several million dollars.\nI trust Elice isn’t writing a show about copyrights and patents. Given the setting, Lipton and Rossmer’s score is a contemporary take on popular music of the 1930s.\nI envision a big production number at the top of Act 2 called “Welcome to Marvin Gardens”; a comedy song, set in jail, called “Just Visiting” and a heartbreaking ballad, “Income Tax: Pay 10 Percent or $200.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:30:46.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
