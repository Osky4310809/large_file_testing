As in, he’s been cast as Starship Discovery’s Captain Lorca. He’ll be acting alongside The Walking Dead’s Sonequa Martin-Green in the role of Lieutenant Commander Rainsford, and Michelle Yeoh as Captain Georgiou .\nSounds like a badass crew if you ask us. Other details are scarce at this point, but we’re super excited that the next dose of Star Trek involves Lucius Malfoy! And it’s kinda a big deal, since the show is coming off the heels of a super successful movie reboot (no pressure!). For Isaacs it’s a big chair to fill, but we’re confident he’s going to bring his magic to the character.\nNice chair. Hope it's comfy. pic.twitter.com/xwfdWAmBQW \n— Jason Isaacs (@jasonsfolly) March 7, 2017 We love how effortlessly Isaacs is able to jump between film and TV, and we’ve enjoyed his recent (creepy) appearance in The OA on Netflix . He has numerous film projects coming up as well, including Hotel Mumbai with Dev Patel, and London Fields with Amber Heard. 2017 is definitely crazy busy for this guy.\nAnd in his hectic schedule, Isaacs somehow found time to meet up with his Harry Potter son Draco, AKA Tom Felton, and stroll around the wizarding world at Universal’s Harry Potter World.\nMe and the wizarding blond bombshell reunited and wandering around Universal's #wizardingworldofharrypotter extremely cognito. A welcome escape from the horrors of the world until we answered questions on stage and were reminded what the stories were all about: fighting fascism, embracing diversity and never giving up hope. Suddenly seemed a lot less fantastical. Still, huge love and thanks to all the Potterites who made it a glorious weekend. You're all brilliant - even the tragically unSlytherin.

Strolling round @unistudios Wizarding World of Harry Potter completely anonymously and thrilled to see that Slytherin is the house of choice for all the cool kids. Hope they keep the faith all the way through juvie and the big house. #harrypotter \nA post shared by Jason Isaacs (@therealjasonisaacs) on Apr 12, 2016 at 1:24pm PDT \nCan’t wait to see Star Trek: Discovery, along with everything else that Jason Isaacs gets cast in. And hmm, Trekker marathon, anyone?\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:11:47.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
