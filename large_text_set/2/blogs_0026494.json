While the former is a budget offering, the latter is has been loaded with enough firepower to lock heads with the mid-range competition. The Moto G5 Plus is the successor to the highly popular Moto G4 Plus ( review ) and the second G Plus smartphone to be manufactured under the Lenovo branding. Let’s take a look at how it fares against its predecessor. Display and Design \nTaking cues from the Moto Z ( review ), the Moto G5 Plus now flaunts a aluminium unibody design thereby replacing the textured rear panel with a smooth metallic finish. The fingerprint sensor remains integrated with the home button, but the contours of the same have been redesigned to feel more natural as opposed to the square-shaped sensor seen last year. The rear camera module is also in-line with the current Moto design ethos with a circular ring housing. Possibly to make the device more ergonomic, the screen size has been reduced from 5.5-inch to 5.2-inch in this generation, while retaining the same full HD IPS LCD display. A w ater repellent nano-coating has been applied on the phone to help it endure occasional yet inevitable splashes. A coating of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display. Performance and Software \nThe Moto G5 Plus is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor which is an improvement over the Snapdragon 617 SoC seen on its predecessor in terms of faster performance, graphics improvements and power efficiency. The device also gets a bump in the internal storage being offered on the base model, with combinations of 3GB RAM/32GB and 4GB RAM/64GB being up for grabs. It further allows users to further expand storage up to 128GB using a microSD card. The smartphone runs Android 7.0 (Nougat) out of the box and offers the same vanilla android experience which is known for its smoothness and ease of use. Several tweaks including the gesture-based Moto Actions interactions have been retained as well. Camera The Moto G4 Plus ( camera review ) impressed us with its camera quality across various lighting conditions. It flaunted a 16-megapixel (f/2.0) snapper at the back, with fast focussing capabilities thanks to the laser autofocus and PDAF (phase detection autofocus) mechanism. However, the device missed out on 4K video recording, which has been accounted for in this upgrade. The Moto G5 Plus offers a 12-megapixel (f/1.7) rear snapper with dual autofocus pixels and a 5-megapixel selfie snapper. According to Lenovo, the smartphone is the first camera in its class with Dual Autofocus Pixels technology. Utilising 10 times more pixels on the sensor, the camera is able to lock onto a subject up to 60 percent faster than before. Battery, Connectivity and Pricing Both devices draw power from 3,000mAh non-removable Li-Ion batteries. Thanks to minimal bloatware, the Moto G4 Plus was able to deliver a day’s worth of moderate usage, and we expect the same from its successor. While Lenovo has chosen not to opt for USB Type C ports in this iteration, the bundled TurboPower charger claims to deliver upto six hours of usage after a quick 15 minute charge over the microUSB 2.0 port. The smartphones also share the same set of connectivity options including 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, WiFi Direct, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS and Bluetooth v4.2. Coming to the pricing, it’ll be safe to assume that the Moto G5 Plus will be priced under Rs 20,000 in India (hopefully even below Rs 15,000), but without an official statement from Lenovo, this should be taken with a pinch of salt.
