Before it pops, the pressure inside reaches around 135 psi and its internal temperature hits 356 degrees fahrenheit. \nBut that’s not slow enough. At 30,000 FPS—1,250 times slower than real time—you can watch the kernel’s insides expand peel the hard hull apart like a rose blooming. If it gets much slower, this kernel’s heading back in time.
