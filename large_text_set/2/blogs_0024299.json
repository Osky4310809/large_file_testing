The advisory, the FOP notes , doesn't represent the FOP's agenda. Instead, it's intended to specify the “potential actions” the new administration may take to assist law enforcement and give officers a preview of the changes that could be coming. \nAs a police executive tasked with implementing effective leadership, and a black woman who is a member of a community that fights for justice equality, I understand well the nuances of the police-community partnership. Many of the potential actions documented by the FOP would loosen controls on the use of militarized equipment, eliminate the much needed recommendations from former president Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, and reverse the ban on racial profiling. These efforts run counter to sustaining a positive relationship between cops and minority communities. \nThe common mission of law enforcement is to uphold civil rights and to dispense justice fairly. The first item on the FOP's list — rescinding Obama's executive order that clamped down on the amount and type of militarized equipment doled out to police departments — is one of the most dangerous. \nPolice militarization is a barrier to positive community relations. The type of equipment that is used, and when it is used, is important. Communities that might already be disadvantaged by crime, poverty, poor education and joblessness need various forms of focused assistance, not over-policing with equipment designed for the battlefield and not troubled neighborhoods. There might be times when police need to use an armored truck or riot gear — say, when saving an injured person or responding to a riot. Limiting the amount and type of equipment issued is crucial. Police imagery and symbolism are as important today as they were during the civil rights movement. \nI've been a member of the National Black Police Association for 17 years. In 2015, then-chairman of the NBPA, Malik Aziz, participated in a panel discussion on police diversity for the Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The task force published a list of recommendations that are just as important today as they were then in eliminating outdated tactics that result in ineffective policing. \nThe task force recommended that police build trust through accountability, transparency and procedural justice; develop effective policies that provide necessary oversight; provide technology that supports crime reduction and is responsibly utilized; encourage crime reduction through positive community partnerships; provide training and education in contemporary policing strategies; and prioritize mental and physical officer wellness. Maintaining these recommendations should have been on the FOP's list. Instead, \"de-prioritize implementation of some or all of the recommendations\" from the task force was among the top 10. \nIn addition to these six task force pillars, the Trump administration should continue to phase out the use of private prisons, which the federal government began last year. They have been deemed less safe for both inmates and correctional workers; they are no longer a practical means of addressing overcrowding from other prisons, due to a declining prison population; and they allow private companies to make millions of dollars through mass incarceration, which disproportionately affects communities of color. The continued phaseout is a key component of criminal justice reform. \nFinally, there should be strict adherence to the ban on racial profiling. The Department of Justice has issued guidance on the use of race and other characteristics in the performance of law enforcement duties. Stopping and detaining people based on racial bias undermine trust in the community. \nBlack and Latino men and women are stopped, arrested and incarcerated at a much higher rate than others. Progressive police leaders understand the impact that bias has had on the ability to effectively fight crime. Racial profiling is not a substitute for accurately searching for suspects, using identifying details other than race, or good police work. In addition, racial profiling can lead to civil rights violations, expensive litigation and the need to develop consent decrees, which consume human resources and take time to address. There are not enough positive results associated with racial profiling that outweigh the negative results of such bias. \nPolicing is a noble profession. \nIn order for men and women in blue to continue excellent work, it is critical that there is sustained emphasis on addressing the distrust that has developed between police and communities of color. We must keep those strategies that work, including a robust civil rights and criminal justice reform agenda. Our actions must reflect the highest of policing standards, and our communities should demand and expect that we create a safe, just America by following proven guidelines. \nSonia Y.W. Pruitt is vice chairperson of the National Black Police Association, the oldest black police advocacy group in the United States, founded in 1972.
