In addition to many important bug fixes, this massive update brings lots of improvements to supported languages, frameworks, and built-in tools. Java 9 : The latest builds of JDK 9 are fully supported, with assisted project import and coding assistance for editing module declarations. Built-in inspections validate module declarations and provide quick-fixes for adjusting project dependencies. Learn more… Java 8 : Quick-fixes that help migrate for loops to Stream API calls have been improved and now support more sophisticated scenarios. We’ve also added a quick-fix that turns Stream API calls back into for loops, which is handy for debugging or exploring code. Async-aware debugger : Async stacktraces is a new feature that substitutes parts of a stack trace related to asynchronous code execution with data captured from where that code is invoked. This helps you focus on what you’re debugging. An improved Smart Step Into also supports asynchronous code and lambda expressions running on other threads. Better VCS : The Log panel for Git and Mercurial has new display options, the Diff dialog gets an option to Ignore imports and formatting , and File History for Git is now faster. We’ve also added Favorite Branches and Speed Search to the Branches popup for Git . Search : The Find in Path dialog, which previously had added a Preview tab, has been reworked from the ground up and now shows instant results in the first place. What is more important, now you can open any selected result in the Editor simply by pressing Enter . Spring : Spring Testing has been updated to support Spring Boot 1.4.3 , and the upcoming Spring 5.0 . Spring Data tools are updated to version 2.0 (including MongoDB , Redis , Solr, KeyValue , Gemfire , Apache Cassandra , REST , Neo4j , Couchbase , and Elasticsearch ). There’s also a new Data tab in the Spring tool window which brings better repository navigation. Gradle : Support for Composite Builds is much improved with the detection of includeBuild in Gradle settings and automatic project configuration. Kotlin 1.1 : Among other things, the new version of this JVM language introduces coroutines—the new non-blocking asynchronous API, and fully supports compilation to JavaScript. This means you can use Kotlin strings, collections, sequences, arrays and other core API in your JavaScript apps. Scala : Scala plugin improvements include a simpler Project Wizard , better SBT support, additional Akka -specific coding assistance, and the new Worksheet REPL mode . JavaScript : We’re bringing first-class support for Vue.js, lots of new code style options for JavaScript and TypeScript, faster and more reliable integrations with Angular , ESLint and TSLint (including language service support and TSLint -powered quick-fixes). Plus, simpler editing of project dependencies in package.json with package names and versions completion and easier running of Mocha and Jest tests with the new Run gutter icon that also displays test state. Go : Gogland , the new Go IDE that we announced several months ago now also becomes IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate plugin . Database tools : IntelliJ IDEA now allows you to transfer table schemas and data between any two databases (yes, even from MySQL to Microsoft SQL Server and back). Emoji : The editor now supports Unicode emoji characters (handy for writing comments). Android Studio 2.2.2 : This update includes all changes from Android Studio 2.2.2 . Docker : The Docker plugin now supports Docker for Mac and works via “unix://”. Windows : The 64-bit installer for Windows lets you give IntelliJ IDEA more RAM. \nFor more details about IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1, check out the What’s New page. \nYour feedback is very much appreciated here in the comments, as always. For bug reports, please use our issue tracker . \nP.S. Don’t forget to install Toolbox App – it’s really great at managing your IDE installations and projects. It helps you always be up-to-date with the latest releases, and safely roll back to stable versions if anything goes awry. \nThe Drive to Develop ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:12:53.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
