It takes a lot of passion, time and money to be a good designer. It is hard, it is a killer business. Celebrities have the advantage, so why not put that power to good use?”\nThe event honored Macy’s boss Terry Lundgren. In 2015, Mallis dared to declare, “I’m kind of over Kanye,” which sent West off on one of his usual Twitter rants.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:52:06.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
