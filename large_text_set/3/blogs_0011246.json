Philstar.com/Efigenio Toledo IV \nMANILA, Philippines — For actress Lauren Young, her sister Miss World 2013 Megan Young can marry anytime she wants. \n“Honestly, it's none of my business,” she told reporters during the recent launch of the L’Oreal Professionel’s Smartbond Transforms. \nLauren admitted that she has been asking her sister, who happens to be the girlfriend of her colleague, Mikael Daez, since her batchmates are already getting married. Nonetheless, she said Megan is not yet sharing plans of settling down to her. \n“They're all getting married, they're all having kids but I always ask them [Megan and Mikael], ‘O, when are you getting married?’” Young shared. \n“Saab got married, Maxine's engaged… Her friends in high school, when they do reunion it's not drinking anymore because there are kids, so now, it's just like playing… I’m like, ‘O, how about you? When are you gonna get married?” she added. \nAlthough she has been asking her sister about tying the knot, Lauren said that what she likes about her sister is she does not give in to the pressures of society and everyone else around her.   \n“It's just like you know when you're in high school, kailangan ko ng boyfriend kasi lahat ng barkada ko may boyfriend. Si Megan hindi siya ganun,” Lauren said. \nLauren, who is also now a producer, said that she will support her sister’s decision and that she believes Megan is only working for her future. \n“It's really like you know, she's worked so hard and a lot of good opportunities have opened up for her ever since she won Miss World and so many good things are still happening to her, so I think she should really focus on that because like what I said, showbiz is not forever,” Lauren said. \nFor Lauren, when the right time to get married will just come. She shared that when she was younger, she thought she will get married at 28, but when she became older, she said it does not matter anymore. \n“If you really do love each other, then it'll happen,” she concluded. \nMegan, 27, and Mikael, 29, just recently confessed their six-year relationship. The celebrity couple said it took them six years because of their obligations at work, including having love teams as well as Megan's Miss World. \nMikael said the announcement of their relationship was not planned but he informed Megan about it. \n\"Nasanay na lang kami na hindi umaamin. Lahat naman ng friends namin, lahat ng workmates namin, alam na nila,” Mikael said   “Tonight with Arnold Clavio\" last week.
