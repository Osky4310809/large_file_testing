File photo/Benham Rise Program \nMANILA, Philippines — (Updated 4:20 p.m.) The Philippines can enforce its sovereign rights in the Benham Rise region through joint exploration, Kabayan party-list Rep. Harry Roque, a deputy minority leader, said. \nBenham Rise, situated 250 kilometers east of Dinapigue, Isabela, is part of the country's extended continental shelf. \nRoque noted that the country can only exercise sovereign rights in the region as it is not part of Philippine territory. The country, however, has exclusive rights to explore and exploit natural resources in the region. \n\"I will repeat my earlier legal opinion that sovereign rights may be the subject of joint exploration. This is the decision of the Supreme Court in La Bugal-B’laan v. Ramos,\" Roque said in a statement Wednesday. \nIn January, Roque voiced the same opinion on joint exploration in disputed areas of   \nRoque said in a statement then that \"the idea of coming to mutual agreements over natural resources is constitutional and has been beneficial in the past.\"   \nWATCH: Joint exploration with China akin to surrendering, says Senior Associate Justice Carpio \nIf the Philippines would consider joint exploration in Benham Rise, foreign corporations may act as contractors while the government will exercise control and supervision over the operation under financial and technical assistance agreements (FTAA). \n\"The only requirement is that it must be the president that must sign the written FTAA and it must be submitted to Congress for review, because whether or not we will allow a foreign country or foreign company to jointly explore resources with us in areas covered by sovereign rights is an issue of policy and therefore Congress must be allowed to review such a document,\" Roque said. Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, citing Article 77 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, said the Philippines has the \"sovereign right\" to explore and exploit the oil, gas and other mineral resources as well as sedentary resources like shellfish in Benham Rise. 'Ships only passing through' \nRep. Roque said that the Philippines cannot complain if Chinese survey ships were merely sailing through. \nIf, however, the Chinese vessels were surveying and prospecting for oil, this would be a violation of Philippines sovereign rights, Roque said. \nChina's Foreign Ministry has acknowledged that it did send vessels through the Benham Rise region. It said that \"according to the competent authorities, Chinese vessels for marine research did sail across relevant waters to the northeast of Luzon, the Philippines last year, exercising navigation freedoms and the right to innocent passage only, without conducting any other activities or operations.\" \nMalacañang said Tuesday that Benham Rise belongs to the Philippines and the country is duty-bound to protect its sovereign rights over the region. \n“Other countries can exercise innocent passage and territorial navigation, but they are disallowed to stay and establish any structure in the area,” Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a press briefing. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte on Monday said the government was \"advised way ahead\" that Chinese ships would be in the area. He also said that concerns over Chinese presence in Benham Rise were exaggerated. \n“Why pick a fight? I’d rather talk. Kung gusto nila ng show of force dun, papuntahin ko Navy. Pagdating dun, banggain mo lang sa likod then say sorry naglalambing lang po. May amin kami diyan. Ganun lang (I will send the Navy, ask them to hit the rear part of their ship and say sorry, just showing affection. We own that. That’s it),” the president said in jest at a press conference.
