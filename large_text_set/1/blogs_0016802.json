Our people were killed in Southern Kaduna, over 800 persons and there is still no official statement from the President of this nation. What is more important in this world if not the lives of fellow citizens? \n“Our people are being killed for no reason and I don’t know if President Buhari and his cohorts are planning another civil war against us in Nigeria. When former President Jonathan was in Aso Rock, we never heard of such killings. Enough is enough. Let him bear in mind that the United Nations, UN, is watching and very soon, he will be charged for genocidal activities against Ndigbo.” \nCleric blames killings on FG’s delay \nMeanwhile, Anglican Bishop of Oleh Diocese, Delta State, Rev John Aruakpor, has blamed the escalation of the ethno-religious crisis in Southern part of Kaduna State on the delay of the Federal Government in getting requisite information needed for thorough appraisal and resolution of the crisis. \nSpeaking during the diocesan monthly “Restoration Mountain” at St. Paul’s Cathedral, Oleh, Isoko South Local Government Area, Delta State, the cleric lamented the massacre of innocent Christians and stressed the need for the leadership of the country to make conscious effort to attend to the need and aspirations of the people at the appropriate time. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T08:09:39.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
