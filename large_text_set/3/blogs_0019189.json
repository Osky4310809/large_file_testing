But for most of us, we don’t have to wonder who the “bigger star” is in the relationship. After being bumped to a day earlier, Dax Shepard realized he was replaced by Kristen Bell this week on Late Night With Seth Meyers . This might have been a move that most celebrities wouldn’t bat an eyelash at. But when you’re bumped due to your wife, we can understand where it’d get a bit more difficult.\nThe two are both promoting their new movie CHiPS , which hits theaters on March 24th. According to Shepard, he was supposed to be on the show Wednesday night. But, he appeared on Tuesday because they suddenly bagged a bigger star — Bell.\nShepard, originally thinking the bump was due to a star like Tom Cruise, explained how it all went down. So I was supposed to be on Wednesday, and then I got a call from my publicist that said they got a bigger guest, so you got bumped to Tuesday,” Shepard said. “So I get home that night and Kristen says, ‘Hey, I’m doing Seth on Wednesday, what day are you doing it?'” Meyers, calling it a “wife bump,” thought it was pretty funny. Since Shepard and Bell often have adorable small quarrels, this is pretty much an ideal situation for the two of them to be in.\nWe’re sure the two had a blast filming CHiPS together. The movie is based on the television series from the late ’70s and early ’80s of the same name.\nShepard even wrote the screenplay and directed the film, which is pretty cool — even though he admitted that the part he gave to Bell was “unlikable.” (Bell, unlikable? We find that difficult to process.)\nWe hope that sometime in the near future, we can see these two (equally important) stars interview together!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:56:16.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
