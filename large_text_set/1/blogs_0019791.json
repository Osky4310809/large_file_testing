Insigne went close again in the opening 45 minutes, with Callejon also testing the goalkeeper from a dead ball. \nDangerman Insigne came even closer to breaking the deadlock just after the hour mark, another free-kick from a demanding angle rattling the crossbar with Tatarusanu beaten. \nAnd Fiorentina's defence was finally breached with 19 minutes to go, when a fast counter-attack saw Insigne find Marek Hamsik down the left. The captain centred a neat chip for Callejon to head at goal, with Tatarusanu this time unable keep it out. \nJuventus, AC Milan, Inter, Lazio and Roma are among the other clubs aiming to join Napoli in the last four.
