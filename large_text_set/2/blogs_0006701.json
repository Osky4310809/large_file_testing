Shares \nEverything about Stories Untold echoes the '80s-styled Netflix sci-fi TV programme Stranger Things, right down to its iconic era-authentic artwork. The latter is in fact designed by Kyle Lambert who designed the show's poster, however its game variation is a collection of parser-based narrative adventures that starts with The House Abandon—a one-time Ludum Dare entry and itch.io game that Tom Sykes covered in his Free Games of the Week column last year. \nDeveloped by Glasgow-based outfit No Code and published by Devolver Digital, Stories Untold is heading to Steam on February 27, where it aims to \"scare your pants off\", for £3.99/$4.99.
