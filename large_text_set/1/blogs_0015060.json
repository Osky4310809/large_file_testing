Battered and bruised,” Wright says in the video, the Mail reported.\nWright indicated that he thinks the reptile is injured.\n“Not a bad size crocodile. Look at the size of that fella,” he adds.\nThe crocodile was estimated to be 12 feet in length.\n“[I was] coming down, fishing here, trying to get a barramundi, and look who comes wandering down here. He is a monster,” says Wright.\nHe posted about the incident on his Facebook page.\n“This big fella's trying a little white water rafting without the raft,” wrote Wright.\nHe added a warning to everyone close to rivers and other bodies of water during Australia’s dry season.\n“Remember big crocs are traveling around this time of year, even in the nicest cleanest springs, [so] be careful and be croc wise,” wrote Wright.\nWright is the star of National Geographic’s show Outback Wrangler. Season two of the series premiered in the US Jan. 13.\nIn December, Wright invited a group of US journalists to his Northern Territories home to promote the show.\n“Matt’s life is just so authentic. He’s even more ridiculous in person,” said Molly Mulrain of National Geographic, according to News.com.au.\nWright showed the assembled writers how he relocated a 13.5 foot crocodile from a rescue pond back into the wild.\n“he put this [old] door in the pool and he was standing on it, but he kept slipping into the water which was so murky you couldn’t see where the crocodile was. I was so nervous for him, I actually thought he was going to die,” Mulrain added.\nWright has a history of dealing with large crocodiles, having helped catch a massive one estimated at 16.5 feet in length in 2009. He posted a picture of the animal in February 2016.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:45:15.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
