The company’s Welcome Offer which offered unlimited voice calls and 4G data until December 31st, 2016 created a ripple in the country’s telecom market. Jio extended its free services through the Happy New Year offer , which expires on March 31st this year. Jio became the world’s fastest growing technology company by attracting 50 million users in a record 83 days since launch. Today, the company has announced that as of December 31st, 2016, there were 72.4 million subscribers on its network. \nThe numbers were announced by Reliance Industries Limited during its Q3 results today. According to Assocham, the subscriber base of Reliance Jio will reach 100 million in 2017. Mukesh Ambani has invested $25 billion in Jio, and is now spending more to boost coverage and better the network’s infrastructure. In the press release, the brand mentioned that it continues to face points of interconnection (POI) congestion issues with some of the largest telcos in the country. The resultant call failure rates continue to be of the order of 175 calls failing out every 1,000 calls from Jio to Airtel. While call drops continue to plague the telco, Reliance Jio’s 4G speeds were the highest among five telcos in December 2016.
