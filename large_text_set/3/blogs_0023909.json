Now the FBI director cannot have it both ways.” \nCirca news reporter Sara Carter joined Hannity on the program and noted the fact that Flynn was surveilled makes it very possible other members of the Trump team were as well. \nShe added that the FBI “conducted a traditional investigation into Trump’s server [last summer] that was located outside of Trump Tower and that they found no evidence of criminality at all.” \nHannity said the Russians have tried before and they will likely try again in 2020 to influence the American election. \nHe pointed out that congressional Democrats did not seem nearly as concerned about foreign attempts to meddle in elections, when the Obama administration actively sought to oust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2014. That effort included nearly $350,000 in U.S. taxpayer money going to an Israeli group seeking to bring down the Netanyahu government. \nHannity then played a clip of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R- Calif, questioning both Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers over whether they have seen any evidence of the Russians hacking into the voting systems of any of the key states that helped Trump win the election. Neither had. \nAs reported by Western Journalism , radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said on his program on Monday the hearings are part of a carefully constructed narrative to undermine the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. \n“[T]he purpose of this is to further the narrative that Trump is illegitimate, that he should not be president, that his election was the result of tampering by the Russians,” he said.
