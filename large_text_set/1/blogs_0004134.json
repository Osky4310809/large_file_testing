The third-generation Flir One cameras connect to smartphones via a USB Type-C port to take thermal photos and videos, or provide a real-time look at the temperature range of an object or scene.\nThe latest Flir One features an all-new image processor, a higher resolution camera and is less expensive than its predecessor from 2015, launching for $199 compared to the $250. In addition, the new model has an adjustable dongle which allows it to be used when the smartphone is housed in a case (this previously required use of an adapter).\nSee also: Samsung dual-camera tech patent could improve capture of moving images 18 hours ago Meanwhile, the company has also introduced the Flir One Pro, an even more durable version with a more powerful thermal sensor. As the name suggests, the Pro version is targeted at professionals with more specific functions like “multiple spot temperature meters” and “one-touch reporting capabilities”\nThe Flir One Pro will go on sale for $399 and both devices will be available in the first half of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T11:50:21.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
