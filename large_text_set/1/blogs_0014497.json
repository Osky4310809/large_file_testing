Specifically the heavy tone and lack of levity. \nThat's why the first footage of Justice League was such a pleasant surprise to many when it debuted at San Diego Comic-Con last year. Affleck was asked about the stark difference between the DC Cinematic Universe's first phase and this newer one that isn't afraid to include some humor during an interview with Cineplex . \n“ Justice League , you probably saw the teaser that came out of Comic-Con; I thought it is nicely emblematic of the kind of minor tone shift and segue in storytelling. It’s a little bit lighter, the characters are a little bit more comfortable in themselves, so they can express a wider array of emotions. And there are just more people in it, so it’s more fun. It’s all of these different characters bumping up against each other and the team dynamic offers a lot of dramatic possibility.” \nThere has been some shaking up of the creative team since BVS, including the appointing of Geoff Johns as producer and Ben Affleck as an exective producer on Justice League . The early footage was a massive step in the right direction, so hopefully that same tone permeates throughout the entire film. \nIn Justice League , fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. \nJustice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Ciarán Hinds, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons and Jesse Eisenberg. \nJustice League hits theaters on November 11, 2017, while Logan lands in theaters on March 3, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:46:06.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
