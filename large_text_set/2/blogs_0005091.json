How to Use Facebook Page Engagement Custom Audiences by Charlie Lawrance on Social Media Examiner. Find the Facebook Page Engagement Custom Audience Feature \nThe real impact of Facebook fans on your business is not just about the size of your audience; it’s how engaged they are with your content. \nPreviously, the only way you could target your Facebook page audience with ads was either as a whole audience or by creating segments with basic demographic and interest targeting. Since there were no dynamic targeting options, your target audience would include a large number of people who like your page but don’t actually interact with any of your posts or ads. \nWith the introduction of page engagement custom audiences, you can now segment and build audiences based on the interactions people have with your Facebook page and ads . This allows you to target only the most engaged people who will be hyper-responsive to your ad campaigns. \nTo create a page engagement custom audience , navigate to your Ads Manager , click the menu button in the top-left corner, and select All Tools . Navigate to the Facebook Ads Manager menu and select All Tools. \nIn the Assets column, click Audiences . In Facebook Ads Manager, click Audiences in the Assets column. \nWhen the Audiences dashboard loads, click Create Audience and choose Custom Audience from the drop-down list. In Facebook Ads Manager, click Create Audience and select Custom Audience from the drop-down list. \nIn the Create a Custom Audience pop-up box that appears, select Engagement on Facebook . Select Engagement on Facebook as the type of custom audience you want to create. \nThen select Page . The new page engagement custom audience box will appear. Select Page as the type of engagement you want to use to create your Facebook custom audience. \nNext, you’ll need to select your page engagement targeting options. Here’s a look at the different custom audiences you can create and when to use them. #1: Target Everyone Who Has Engaged With Your Page \nThe broadest page engagement audience includes everyone who has visited your page or engaged with your page’s content or ads on Facebook or Messenger . This is the default option. \nTo create this custom audience, first select your Facebook page . Then from the Include drop-down list, choose Everyone Who Engaged With Your Page . Select Everyone Who Engaged With Your Page from the Include drop-down list. \nNext, choose your duration (150 days, for example). This is the window of time when the engagement occurred. It’s a dynamic value, so it will be a rolling time period. \nThe higher the number of days you choose, the larger your audience will be. However, there’s a trade-off between audience quality and duration. There’s less recognition from people who engaged with your page more than 180 days ago. \nFinally, give your audience a name and click Create Audience . As with all custom audiences, it can take up to 30 minutes for Facebook to populate your audience. You’ll receive a notification when it’s ready to use. Once you’ve created your new Facebook custom audience, it can take up to 30 minutes to populate. #2: Target Anyone Who Has Visited Your Page \nThis custom audience includes people who have visited your page, which is a narrower audience than the one above. \nIf you’re a local restaurant, for example, you could use this custom audience in direct-response campaigns encouraging people to take a specific action , such as downloading a discount coupon or contacting you directly through Messenger to make a reservation. \nTo create this audience, select your Facebook page , and choose Anyone Who Visited Your Page from the Include drop-down list. \nThen enter your audience engagement duration . If you choose 150 days, for example, anyone who has visited your Facebook page in the last 150 days will be included in your custom audience. Finally, name your audience and click Create Audience . To create your Facebook custom audience, select Anyone Who Visited Your Page from the Include drop-down list. #3: Target People Who Engaged With Your Post or Ad \nThis custom audience includes the people who have engaged with your page post or ad. Engagement includes reactions (like, love, haha, wow, sad, or angry), shares, comments, link clicks, and carousel swipes. \nFor example, if you’re an ecommerce company, you could target this audience in the middle of your sales funnel (after top-of-funnel content campaigns) for direct-response retargeting campaigns aimed at generating sales. \nIf you test this targeting against regular page likes targeting, you’re likely to see better click-through rates and higher conversions. The reason for this is your business is top of mind due to the previous engagement people had with either a post or ad. \nTo build this custom audience, select your page and choose People Who Engaged With Any Post or Ad from the Include drop-down list. Then choose your audience engagement duration . To create your custom audience, select People Who Engaged With Any Post or Ad from the drop-down list. \nFinally, give your audience a name and click Create Audience . The new audience will appear in your Audiences dashboard with a blue circle in the Status column while it populates. #4: Target People Who Clicked on Your Call-to-Action Button \nThis custom audience is made up of people who have clicked a call to action (CTA) button on your page (such as Contact Us or Shop Now). It can be effective to target this audience for retargeting campaigns to encourage people to take a specific action (after they’ve visited the destination of your CTA button but haven’t converted). \nFor example, if your page CTA is Shop Now, you could run ads to target people who didn’t purchase when they first clicked on the CTA button. \nTo create this audience, select your Facebook page and choose People Who Clicked on Any Call-to-Action Button from the Include drop-down list. Choose the option to include people who have clicked a call-to-action button on your Facebook page. \nThen select your audience engagement duration , give your audience a name , and click Create Audience . #5: Target People Who Messaged Your Page \nIf you run specific Messenger-based ad campaigns or receive lots of messages on your page organically, this custom audience is for you. It allows you to target people who have messaged your Facebook page. \nFor example, if you own a local business, you could run direct promotions to people who have messaged your page . This is a hyper-responsive audience of people who have reached out to you for a specific reason. \nTo set up this custom audience, select your Facebook page and choose People Who Sent a Message to Your Page from the Include drop-down menu. Select the option to create an audience of people who have sent a message to your Facebook page. \nNext, select your audience engagement duration ; the maximum amount of time you can choose is 365 days. Then give your audience a name and click Create Audience . #6: Target People Who Saved Your Post (or Page) \nThis custom audience is made up of people who have saved your page or a post on your page. \nIt’s useful to target this audience for top-of-funnel content campaigns to re-engage people who have previously found your content valuable enough to save . Similar to the message-based engagement custom audience, this audience is usually hyper-responsive. \nTo create this custom audience, select your Facebook page and choose People Who Saved Your Page or Any Post from the Include drop-down list. Create a custom audience of people who have saved your Facebook page or post. \nNext, select your audience engagement duration . It can be as short as 1 day or as long as 365 days. Name your audience and click Create Audience . \nConclusion \nThere are currently six Facebook page engagement custom audiences you can create, which will group people based on their interaction with your page and ads. These custom audiences are best used in the middle of your sales funnel as they target warm prospects who have previously interacted with your business on Facebook. \nWhat do you think?
