Ilorin, Kwara State, Assistant Editor ADEKUNLE YUSUF reveals dirty details of an academic fraud covered up by the 42-year-old university \nFrom time immemorial, stealing and publication of another person’s work as one’s own original work – with or without consent – is often detested as the height of academic dishonesty. That explains why plagiarism, a form of intellectual theft that regularly attracts serious punishments from academic integrity committees, easily mutilates or ruins careers, especially in the academia where it is loathed as an anathema. But at UNILORIN, the exact opposite is what happened. It has elevated one of UNILORIN lecturers to the rank of Professor and Vice Chancellor, in spite of serious acts of plagiarism established against him by the Faculty of Social Sciences Investigative Committee, which probed the allegations against him. The culprit in question is Dr. Abdullateef Usman, formerly of the Department of Economics in UNILORIN. An academic widely regarded as an administration crony during his days in the university, he is now the acting VC of Fountain University, Osogbo, capital of Osun State. The university is owned by Nasrul-Lahi-il-Fatih Society (NASFAT), a leading Islamic society in Nigeria. For a grievous offence, which some academics say should normally warrant a demotion or dismissal to boot, he was allowed to resign and go home to ‘sin no more.’ But if what Dr. Usman was alleged to have done was utterly disgraceful and reprehensible, the reprieve given to him by his “godfathers in UNILORIN” equally came at the most wrong time: after overwhelming evidence of acts of academic misconduct had been established by the investigative committee against him. With the soft landing, Dr. Usman has effortlessly shrugged off a disgrace that would probably have mutilated his career in 2015, though critics are still livid that such a monumental scandal was “cavalierly swept under the carpet”. Trouble started like a child’s play for Dr. Usman when he was caught by chance in the Department of Economics. That was during the short-listing of applicants for the ranks of Professor and Reader in 2015. A routine in the academia, the former Senior Lecturer merely submitted his list of publications for 2014, being part of preconditions for elevation to the next rank. But he had his luck run out, when Dr. G.T. Ijaiya, also of Economics Department, raised alarm that one of the works flaunted by his ambitious colleague was a plagiarised version of his own work, but which Dr. Usman published in his name only. Initially, it was assumed to be a minor oversight, but an Investigative Committee, which was constituted by the Faculty of Social Sciences to probe the allegation, was to unearth more cans of worms that stank to high heavens. After more than three months, the Investigative Committee came up with its sweeping findings into one of the biggest intellectual scandals that almost successfully outfoxed public attention. The voluminous report, which was submitted to the Registrar on June 25, 2015, thoroughly indicted Dr. Usman as a serial plagiarist whose entire academic career and achievements were soaked in intellectual dishonesty. The culprit should be disrobed of all previous academic honours and promotions the system had mistakenly endued him with, the report recommended. According to the minutes of the Faculty Appointment and Promotion Review Panel, which consisted of all professors of the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Faculty Officer, Dr. Usman was also slammed for “refusing to answer a query given to him in respect of his various suspected acts of misconduct” and “issuing ultimatum to the Faculty Appointment and Promotion Review Panel to withdraw a letter of advice written to him in the course of investigating his suspected acts of academic misconduct and using language unbecoming of a person in his circumstance”. The minutes of the Faculty Appointment and Promotion Review Panel said rather than toe the path of honour and defend his own integrity, Dr. Usman “walked out” angrily on the Faculty in 2015. But, The Nation tried hard and succeeded in getting him to defend his name last month. Although he did not answer calls to his two mobile phones, he eventually replied one of the text messages sent to the two lines, which intimated him that questions had been emailed to him. However, by the time he responded to the email, Dr. Usman merely wrote tersely that “I shall get back to you after discussing with my lawyer.” The VC of Fountain University was indeed faithful to his word. He said he was not indicted for plagiarism, adding that he left UNILORIN for better career advancements. Usman said: “I was not indicted for plagiarism or indeed any other offence at the University of Ilorin. I have an unblemished record in that university. The University of Ilorin is there to furnish you with the names of their officers that were indicted. Please cross-check with the authority. I retired voluntarily from the University of Ilorin because I got a better opportunity elsewhere. I was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Ilorin and another university appointed me a Professor. So, I left for a greener pasture. Any other person in my shoes would have done the same. As you can see, I am better off than I was in University of Ilorin.” He, however, resorted to subtle blackmail and threat, warning that “I suggest caution against possible libel. Please let me appeal that you do not allow your most reputable newspaper to be used as a platform for libelous action.” But, unknown to Dr. Usman, The Nation was on top of the story since the day he was caught till the buried scandal became public knowledge both in the Department of Economics and Faculty of Social Sciences, which quickly constituted an Investigative Panel to unravel the truth. It soon became the talk of the whole campus. That was early 2015, as many lecturers openly lampooned and derided not Dr. Usman but authorities of UNILORIN for “aiding and abetting the worst crime in the academia because it involved an administration crony”. The Faculty Appointment and Promotion Review Panel, which also took Dr. Usman to the cleaners for an “attitude unbecoming of a lecturer of his status,” indeed went ahead to process the findings of the Investigative Committee. It said it was not bothered by the culprit’s attitude. While the report was being processed, a letter (with reference number UIL/FSS/01) was sent to the Registrar on April 10, 2015, which was an update on the earlier ones written to the university when Dr. Usman was caught and, later when an Investigative Panel was constituted. The letter reads: “I write to inform you on the case of Dr. Usman of the Department of Economics. I have received the report of the Faculty Investigative Committee on the allegation of plagiarism against Dr. Usman of the Department of Economics and I regret to inform you that the report established and confirmed Dr. Usman’s involvement in widespread plagiarism.” After the Faculty Appointment and Promotion Review Panel had concluded its work, a letter accompanying the findings of the Investigative Committee, was forwarded to the university. It was signed by Professor Ayodele Jimoh, Dean of Faculty of Social Sciences. When The Nation met Prof. Jimoh in 2015, he confirmed the plagiarism scandal and acknowledged that investigations were indeed carried out and recommendations were properly forwarded to the university. But in spite of ceaselessly prodding to literally squeeze water out of stone, the Dean bluntly refused to provide more details. “I am just the Dean of this Faculty; I am not the Vice Chancellor,” he quipped with a tone of finality. In 2016, The Nation also returned to Professor Jimoh to persuade him to talk on updates on the scandal. Asked why Dr. Usman was allowed to escape without facing the consequences of his actions as the law envisages, especially after widespread plagiarism had been proved against him, the Dean also firmly held his ground just as he did in the previous meeting. “I don’t speak for the university. I am neither the Registrar nor the Vice Chancellor,” he retorted in his usual assertive tone. A member of the Investigative Committee, however, attributed it to the “reign of impunity in UNILORIN,” which shielded the culprit from punishment. Curiously, UNILORIN allowed Dr. Usman to resign, instead of meting out the appropriate punishment after receiving the report of Investigative Committee. He turned in his resignation letter on June 25, 2015 – coincidentally on the same day the university received the findings of the Investigative Committee which probed all allegations against the former Senior Lecturer. While the letter accompanying the submission of Investigative Committee report was with reference number UIL/FSS/01, Dr. Usman’s application for withdrawal of service, which was addressed to the VC, was with reference number UIL/PSF/SS/2372 – all on June 25, 2015. “I humbly wish to apply for withdrawal of my services from the university. The notice is given to take effect from 29th June 2015 to 29th September 2015, bearing in mind the mandatory three months’ notice as contained in the university’s conditions of service for senior staff. I am by this application thanking the university for the platform given to me to develop, grow and to serve the university in this capacity for 23 years. Thanks for your usual cooperation,” Dr. Usman wrote in his resignation letter. Interestingly, not even a word about his running ordeals or reasons for wanting to disengage from a beloved university that has “given me the platform to develop, grow and to serve” for over two decades. He was just 52 at the time, obviously unripe for retirement, since a new law pegs retirement age for academics at 70. And on December 30, 2015, the university responded to Dr. Usman’s resignation letter, via a letter with reference number UIL/SSE/PF/2372. Like Dr. Usman’s letter, which evidently glossed over the crisis threatening to hold him by the jugulars, UNILORIN was also conspicuously silent on the monumental plagiarism scandal seeking to erupt under its feet like an angry volcanic magma. Surprisingly, it also completely feigned ignorance of the festering scam, let alone address the findings of the Investigative Committee already in its custody. The reply, written by the the Registrar, reads: “I am pleased to inform you that approval has been granted for the acceptance of your withdrawal of service with effect from September 29, 2015. Liaise with your PFA (pension fund administrator) and register with the National Pension Commission for your entitlements, based on your service of 29 years, 5 months and 3 days in public service. I thank you for the exemplary service you rendered to this institution during the tenure of your appointment and wish you the best of luck in your future endeavours.” \nThe committee’s findings \nAlthough Dr. Usman’s iniquities were swept under the carpet, the voluminous report that contained the findings of the Faculty of Social Science Investigative Committee revealed that his was a career dripping with academic fraud. First, the Investigative Committee concluded that “Dr. Usman plagiarised the work of Dr. G.T. Ijaiya of Economics Department and the extent of plagiarism is put at about 97.8 per cent and that plagiarism is a fashion to Dr. Usman.” Unfortunately, it was the same offending work that led to more discoveries of academic thefts, forcing those wanting to plead on behalf the former Senior Lecturer to quickly lose their voice. Perhaps having tasted the forbidden fruit without ever being caught, the report said Dr. Usman took his escapade to a higher level – going internationally. A careful perusal of number 17 on Dr. Usman’s 2014 list of publications showed that he plagiarised the work of Judith A. Giles and Clara L. Williams, who are both professors at the University of Victoria, Canada. The report established that Dr. Usman’s “Trade Policy Strategies and Employment Growth in Nigeria: Some Econometric Results,” published in Crescent Journal of Business in 2010, contained several word-for-word paragraphs from Judith A. Giles and Clara L. Williams’ “Export-led Growth: A Survey of the Empirical Literature and Some Non-causality Results Part I,” published in Econometrics Working Paper EWP0001″ (ISSN 1485-6441) in 2000(http://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/economics/assets/docs/econometrics/ewp0001.pdf). The plagiarised portions can be found on pages 197-198 and 211-213. Another offending publication was number 24 in Dr. Usman list of publications – “The Impact of Bank Regulations in Nigeria: ‘A Macro Econometric Simulations’,” published in Social Sciences Research Network in 2012. A careful reading also revealed that it contained a number of word-for-word paragraphs copied directly from Donsyah Yudistra’s “The Impact of Capital Requirements in Indonesia.” It was published in 2003, available online at http://econwpa.repec.org/eps/fin/papers/0212/0212002.pdf. A further trace of Yudistra revealed that the academic is of the Department of Economics at Loughborough University, Leicestershire, United Kingdom. According to the findings of the Investigative Committee, the extent of plagiarism was put at about 41.6 per cent. But if Dr. Usman’s conduct in the works cited above was bad, it was even worse in another publication that became controversial in his list of publications for 2012. The offensive publication in question is titled, “External Reserve Holdings in Nigeria: Implications for Investment, Inflation and Exchange Rate,” jointly published by Usman and W. Ibrahim in the Journal of Economics and International Finance, 2012. It plagiarised two academic works, namely “Foreign Exchange Reserves Accumulation: Implication for the Nigerian Economy,” published in 2007 by Magnus O.A., and “Reserves Accumulation in African Countries: Sources, Motivations and Effects,” also published in 2007 in Economics Department Working Paper Series (Paper 24) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, by Adam Elhiraika and Leonce Ndikumana. Other categories of serious acts of plagiarism against Dr. Usman included another publication he co-authored in 2012 with W. Ibrahim. Published in the Social Sciences Research Network, “The Impact of Bank Regulation in Nigeria: A Macro Econometric Simulations” was said to be a “carbon copy” of W. Ibrahim and T. S. Ajagbe’s “The Impact of Bank Regulation in Nigeria: A Macro-Econometric Simulation,” published in the Entrepreneurial Journal of Management Sciences in 2012. The Investigative Committee estimated the “extent of plagiarism at about 87.3 per cent”. That is not all. In another offending publication, Dr. Usman authored in 2012, the Investigative Committee also put the “extent of plagiarism at about 95.3 per cent”. First, it was discovered that the article, “External Reserve Holdings in Nigeria: Implications for Investment and Exchange Rate,” published in the Bi-annual Journal of Institute of Management Studies, is the same entry with two other works by different authors. The works are, “External Reserve Holdings in Nigeria: Implications for Investment, Inflation and Exchange Rate, published in the Journal of Economics and International Finance in 2010, and “Investigating the Relationship between External Reserve Holdings and Selected Macroeconomic Indicator in Nigeria,” published in the Babcock Journal of Management and Social Sciences in 2012. Lastly, another scam was also dug open when a Letter of Acceptance for a publication submitted by Dr. Usman was found to be a fake document. While his Letter of Acceptance bore the name of International Scientific Press and an unknown/untraceable address, the Investigative Committee findings concluded that the official address associated with Science Press Limited (www.sciencepress.com), is Suite 1359, Kemp House, 152-160, City Road London ECIV 2NX, United Kingdom. However, in spite of a deluge of acts of plagiarism established by the Investigative Committee in 2015, the powers that be in UNILORIN looked the other way to save one of their own. \nLoud murmurs greet ‘bonanza’ professorships \nGiven the prestige it confers on recipients, award of professorial rank is always jealously guarded, making its attainment impossible outside the rubric of due process. According to rules and regulations governing academic affairs in public universities, professorship cannot be awarded without being rigorously processed through the Department, Faculty, A&PC, External Assessors and Council – in that order. Unfortunately, this rigorous process is being easily circumvented in UNILORIN with impunity, as there are mounting complaints from senior professors who claim that regulations are being deliberately bent to favour cronies. One academic that is the regular butt of derisive jokes among some of his colleagues in UNILORIN is Dr. Abdulrafi Omotosho of the Department of Islamic Law. Although nobody seems to be calling his erudition to question, his colleagues are unhappy that he attained professorial cadre in 2014 allegedly “through the back door,” or as one Dean puts it, without being “processed through the Department, Faculty, A&PC and External Assessors at all.” According to the Dean, who witnessed the event in 2014, not a few professors in attendance were aghast when the “VC announced Dr. Omotosho as a Professor during a Senate session without following the due process”. Going by regulations governing academic promotions of that nature, it is compulsory for a would-be reader or professor to respond to an advertisement for such vacancies, following which applications are treated and assessed by the Appointments and Promotions Review Panel in the Faculty. Academic traditions further have it that applicants whose submissions receive a positive grade are subsequently invited for an interview by a panel to be set up by the VC, following which the report on deserving ones will be sent to the A&PC and External Assessors. Unfortunately, Professor Omotosho, who transferred his services from the University of Jos, was said not to have undergone any of the mandatory stages of evaluations en-route his professorial rank in UNILORIN. According to three senior professors, including a Dean, who were at the floor of the Senate the day Dr. Omotosho was announced as a professor, it was simply said that he had participated in a professorial assessment six years ago at the University of Jos (UNIJOS). In separate interviews last year, they all spoke with The Nation on off-record basis to escape reprisals. They disclosed that the VC merely announced at the Senate that because the report of assessment Dr. Omotosho undertook in UNIJOS six years ago had come, UNILORIN was bound by it – clearly against all regulations guiding the only route to professorial cadre at the time. Yet, as findings later revealed, professorial assessments had taken place at UNILORIN, which the academic did not bother to participate in since he joined the university. Dr. Omotosho came to UNILORIN from UNIJOS as a lecturer in the Department of Religious Studies – not from Faculty of Law. Findings showed that because his initial degree in Islamic Law from Islamic University of Medina, Saudi Arabia, was said not to be recognised by the Nigerian Legal Council and the Law School, he was in the Department of Religions in UNIJOS. He joined UNIJOS in August 1985, spending twenty years without becoming a professor before he left the university in 2008. However, he was appointed in UNILORIN as Associate Professor in the Department of Islamic Law in December 2008, though it is not clear whether he had remedied the seeming deficiency in his initial degree to enable him function in a Faculty of Law. Writing as a worthy alumnus in the recent edition of the Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies (IMES) newsletter at the University of Edinburgh, where he received his PhD in 1984, Dr. Omotosho traced the trajectory of his career and how he reluctantly accepted lecturing job at UNIJOS in August 1985. “The university (UNIJOS) persuaded me to come and I visited their campus in August 1985, where the interview was conducted and the appointment letter was issued to me the same day. I took up the appointment reluctantly with the hope that I would move to the South within five years. I ended staying for about 24 years. I rose from the rank of Lecturer II at the time of appointment to Professor in 2008,” Dr. Omotosho proudly shared his post-graduation history with his alma mater. His claim that he left his former employers as a professor in 2008 was however found to be contrary to records at UNIJOS, where reports had it that he quit as a result of frustration arising from years of delay in elevating him to professorial rank. Findings further laid it bare that several months before Dr. Omotosho was asked to join professors’ seat at UNILORIN, he had been elevated to the rank of professor in Department of Religious Studies at UNIJOS. That was in February 2014 – six good years after his departure to UNILORIN. According to a statement issued on Friday February 21, 2014, by Steve Otowo, UNIJOS Deputy Registrar (Information and Publications), Dr. Omotosho (Religious Studies Department) was among the 16 academics that were promoted to the rank of professors and 15 others to the rank of readers. And it was not indicated that the awards were backdated for any of the beneficiaries. That is why some professors are livid that his promotion in UNILORIN as Professor of Law was on the basis of his promotion in UNIJOS as Professor of Religious Studies. Critics pooh-poohed the university administration for “bastardising the system.” One of them lamented in frustration, saying “such cases are now rampant in our campus, especially in Law and Veterinary Medicine.” The Dean said: “I have never seen a situation where we use an assessment of another university here. The mere fact that he (Dr. Omotosho) had disengaged there even made it more worrisome. There are other ones, but Omotosho’s case was too glaring because everybody saw it. Even if they had made him to pass through some semblance of assessment, it would have been better. A professor from Federal University in Oye Ekiti came here and we did not find him appointable. If any professor here wants to go to the University of Ibadan, he does not automatically become a professor there.” This, however, did not dissuade admirers of the former Director of the Centre for International Education (CIE) and UNILORIN Archives and Documentation Centre (UADC) from organising a thanksgiving in his honour on Saturday December 27, 2014. At the prayer-filled event, which held at Dam Site, the Chief Imam of UNILORIN, Professor Abdulganiyu Oladosu, said Dr. Omotosho’s elevation was in accordance with the will of Allah and therefore enjoined Muslims to always uphold the tenets of Islam. But Dr. Omotosho is not the only academic whose professorship is tainted by alleged lack of adherence to the exacting rigours of due process. Going by loud murmurs in UNILORIN, Professor Kolawole Raheem Salman is also said to be having thick palls of doubts on his professorial rank due to the way he was awarded, which reportedly fell outside the rubric of due process. He was appointed as a Professor from the Nigerian Law School (NLS). And because the NLS is not run like a conventional university and does not have the same career structure as a university, some academics are at a loss wondering how he could have come from being a lecturer in NLS to become a Professor of Law in UNILORIN. Similar allegations of bending the rules and changing the goalpost in the middle of the game also cloud the academic honours bestowed on a few others in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, especially those who were allegedly promoted to professorial cadre under the administration of the sitting VC without following the rules. His critics said “because the VC is the Chairman of the Appointments and Promotions Committee and has the last say, he is known to have overridden the better judgements of Deans at the AP&C meetings.” They cited the case of his brother, Prof. Ambali also at the Vet Medicine. “Because the VC is also the Chairman of Senate, a lot of power is concentrated in him, which should be exercised with decency and sense of responsibility. But once an occupier of the position is a bigot, a nepotist or a thief, then the system will be in total ruins.” But Professor Ambali defended the promotions, adding the due process was strictly followed in all appointments and promotions done in the university. “The VC does not give anybody professorship. If people know how a professor is made, they will appreciate that no single individual can influence somebody becoming a professor. What happened is that we inherited some delays in some people. When the vacancies were created because of the new programmes that we introduced, we split some departments and faculties and that gave room for people to grow. But where you have about five thousand people, somebody will have to be crazy, and the university is made up of people with weird ideas,” the VC said. \nCulture of impunity \nA thorough review of the payroll of UNILORIN also revealed a system that is excessively cluttered with massive wastages and bogus allowances. Apart from millions being squandered frequently on Duty Tour Allowances (DTA), depletions are also regularly manifested in illegal practices such as “ghost allowances,” which are being paid to staffers of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, who are taking their own equivalent of “call allowance” without rendering any call duty service. Against extant regulations, this same naira rain (call allowance) is equally extended to non-consultant lecturers and professors at the College of Health Sciences, otherwise known as medical lecturers without postgraduate fellowship. Although regulatory provisions say clearly that a possession of fellowship is a sine qua non for the appointment of anyone as a consultant or clinical lecturer, altercations arising from the issue of relativity of postgraduate fellowships in medicine and dentistry vis-à-vis PhD were recently resolved in favour of holders of the latter at UNILORIN. Yet, the Benchmark Minimum Academic Standards handed out for medicine and dentistry by the NUC, which says “any clinician that has only a PhD as his only postgraduate attainment is not appointable as a consultant and cannot have patients under his care,” is not unknown to the university. That is not all. The school’s payroll also showed that administrative units, such as registry and bursary are heavily overstaffed compared to other public universities of its size and age; filled with all sorts of people, including relatives of people at the helms of affairs, leading to redundancies. Although the powers that be are not unaware of this, they seem to be playing the ostrich by trudging along the path of financial recklessness at the detriment of the nation. But one sad fallout of overstaffing is that it has impelled a burden of over-bloated wage bill, a reckless development that is putting so serious a strain on the purse of a university that regularly borrows from the cooperative societies’ fund to offset payment balance, thus incurring the wrath of staff members who depend on the cooperative for last resort lifeline. While many recent products of the university who finished with top grades are busy roaming the streets around the country in search of elusive jobs, UNILORIN is regularly bending its rules, sometimes turning merit on its head, in a bid to accommodate the interests of ‘loyal’ staff members who want their wards to “join the system.” For example, by the time no fewer than twelve persons were employed in the library section last year, it dashed the hopes of those who had been working in the library for years as contract staff. Despite the fact that the disappointed worker had garnered valuable experience working in the university library, the school did not waste any time in dispensing with them, replacing them with the sons, daughters and relatives of big names in the university. That is why some concerned lecturers are raising alarm that the system is being wantonly littered with the likes of a boy who finished with a third class in the university and has now ended up as a permanent hand in UNILORIN FM under the Corporate Affairs section. And his attitude on the job seems to have justified the fears of critics. Since he joined the system as a result of parental influence some years ago, the young man, a happy-go-lucky son of a well-known professor in the school, continually plays truancy on his duty post but no one dare query him in order not to incur the fury of a powerful professor. Although even the university’s most virulent critics admit that it is no crime to employ deserving children of members of staff, their grouse is that the practice has become another instrument of dispensing “political largesse,” if not a tool for feeding patronage and entrenching cronyism by any sitting VC. Now, since it is no longer seen as an anomaly in UNILORIN to have an entire household – comprising father, mother and children – on the payroll of the university, almost all ‘loyal’ academic and non-academic workers whose sons or daughters are not old enough to take up paid employment are literally racing against time to replace themselves with their children as retirement clock ticks. Many lecturers also begrudge the university authorities over the fact that benefits and opportunities that are statutorily meant to be allotted through a transparent and competitive process are dispensed on the basis of “whom you know.” According some lecturers, one of such initiatives being routinely abused is the TETFUND grant for staff development. Scores of academics who spoke with The Nation admitted that the only thing that is done without discrimination in the university is staff development award, but they all said the process of awarding TETFUND is “neither fair nor transparent”. A professor in the Faculty of Arts said: “I have never seen anybody who got TETFUND in this university without knowing the powers that be either directly or indirectly. You must know somebody that knows somebody before you can access it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:44:52.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
