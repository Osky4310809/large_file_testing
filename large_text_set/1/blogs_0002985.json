Adding that within the title, the word ‘fine’ refers to Fineapple and ‘thank you’ expresses the girls’ gratitude to them. \nJinsol explained that during their debut anniversary concert last year, they performed the song for fans for the very first time, but they were excited to record a studio version for “Prelude.” \n“This is a song for the fans who are always cheering for us,” APRIL member Chaewon added. “I remember a few of the members crying [while performing the song] at the anniversary concert. Even when we recorded it, we couldn’t hold it in.” \nMeanwhile, APRIL is currently promoting the title song “April Story” off the same album, which was released on January 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T16:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T12:35:26.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
