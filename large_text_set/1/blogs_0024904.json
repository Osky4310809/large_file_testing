Photo: Getty Images \nIt wasn't as if Pettitt's form with NSW Swifts was all that bad as she was still performing among the best goal attacks and earlier in her career she had done well in the international arena making her debut in 2006 and playing 54 tests. \nSo when Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander called her about the squad for the team's tour of South Africa and England, Pettitt knew not to get her hopes up when the phone rang again. \n\"It's been a tough couple of years, every time I would get a phone call it brought a lot of disappointment,\" Pettitt said. \n\"So to finally get the call and make the side was a relief and exciting â€“ I told my husband and I think he was expecting another 'no', so it was good to have such a happy house. Advertisement \n\"It's a bit of a rollercoaster, you get your hopes up when you have done as well as you can. \n\"You get your feedback, you work on it. You go through the emotions, you get upset, angry, motivated and then get back on the court and prove yourself again. \n\"After several years it was nice to get a 'yes'.\" \nPettitt is expected to be back in the Diamonds side for their first test against New Zealand Silver Ferns in Durban, South Africa at midnight Sunday (AEDT). \nThe Diamonds will also play South Africa in Durban on February 1 before the Netball Quad Series heads to England where the Diamonds will play the England Roses at SSE Arena, Wembley on February 6. \n\"It's a whole new team from when I was last here which makes things exciting,\" Pettitt said. \nIt's been a tough couple of years, every time I would get a phone call it brought a lot of disappointment. Susan Pettitt \n\"There are a few girls who have I played with at the Swifts in the last few years in Paige Hadley and Caitlin Thwaites so that makes it easier to fit back in.\" \nThwaites will fill the vice captain's role for this tour and will likely play at goal shooter alongside either Pettit or Gretel Tippet as Caitlin Bassett has been rested for the tour and Stephanie Wood was withdrawn due to a knee injury. \nThe Diamonds squad is a younger, less experienced one so Pettitt's previous experience should come in handy but the New Zealand side will prove a tough ask either way while South Africa and England are much improved. \n\"We will see how we match up with New Zealand, it's a different Diamonds team with some inexperienced players and some players with the opportunity to do well on the international stage,\" Pettitt said. \n\"I can't wait to hit the court, it's been a long lead up and all the girls are edgy to get out there. \n\"The South Africans have an Australia taste now with Norma Plummer coaching them, they are improving.\" \nWhile the three-week Diamonds tour is front of mind, the Australians and some players from the other nations who have signed with new Australian league, the Suncorp Super Series, will only have 10 days from when they arrive back to when the season begins. \nPettitt has signed with the Swifts' cross town rivals Greater Western Sydney Giants and looks forward to the new league as well. \n\"Our coaches back home are very much hoping we all come back in perfect nick,\" Pettitt said. \nWhatever her role for the Diamonds, Pettitt wants to make every post a winner and, hopefully, make an impression for the future. \n\"I want to make sure I leave no stone unturned, prove I can do this at international level again,\" Pettitt said. \n\"If I can walk away from the tour and say I did everything I can then I'll be happy with that.\" \nThe Diamonds play New Zealand in Durban, South Africa at midnight on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T09:17:04.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
