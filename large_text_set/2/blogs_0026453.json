The only connection between marijuana and violence is the one that exists when illegal sellers battle it out for profits in the black market.\"\nAssuming that Sessions' plans include \"greater enforcement\" of the federal ban on marijuana, as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested last week, it could take several forms. Sessions could easily disavow the Justice Department's policy of prosecutorial forbearance, which was laid out in a 2013 memo from James Cole, then the deputy attorney general. But even without renouncing the Cole memo, Sessions could seriously disrupt or cripple the cannabis industry in states such as Colorado and Washington by taking a broader view of the federal \"enforcement priorities\" Cole listed.\nThose priorities include preventing violence and interstate smuggling, both issues that Sessions raised yesterday. The priorities also include preventing distribution to minors and minimizing \"adverse public health consequences related to marijuana use,\" a potentially unlimited license for federal meddling. Yesterday Sessions also alluded to those rationales for intervention. \"Most of you probably know I don't think America is going to be a better place when more people of all ages, and particularly young people, start smoking pot,\" he said. \"I believe it's an unhealthy practice.\"\nDuring his confirmation hearing last month, Sessions conceded that enforcing the federal ban on marijuana is \"a problem of resources for the federal government\" and said \"some\" of Cole's criteria \"are truly valuable in evaluating cases.\" But he added that \"the criticism I think that was legitimate is that they may not have been followed.\" In fact, that was the theme of the April 2016 Senate hearing at which Sessions said \"the Department of Justice needs to be clear\" that \"marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.\" The title of the hearing, which was held by the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, asked, \"Is the Department of Justice Adequately Protecting the Public from the Impact of State Recreational Marijuana Legalization?\" Sessions' answer clearly is no.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:09:05.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
