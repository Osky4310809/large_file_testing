AP Photo/Aaron Favila, file \nMANILA, Philippines – Defense Secretary Deflin Lorenzana has assured the public the entire 125,000-strong Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) remains supportive of President Duterte. \nLorenzana said the morale among troops remains high, noting how the President, as commander-in-chief, made the effort to visit as many military camps as he could to boost the morale of the military in his campaign against illegal drugs. \nLorenzana made the statement even after Duterte ordered all military camps open for communist rebels after he declared the holiday ceasefire. \nLorenzana shrugged off the reported ouster plot ‘blueprint’ of former US ambassador Philip Goldberg. He said military intelligence units would continue their job of protecting the integrity of the Republic. \nLorenzana gave the assurance in the wake of reported ouster plots against Duterte. \nHe said he did not believe the report of the plot outright. He noted the US State Department had also denied the supposed plot.   \n“I would not even believe it at face value,” Lorenzana said. \nUpon consulting with Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Lorenzana said they agreed to dismiss the ouster rumors.
