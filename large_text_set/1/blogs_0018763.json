His ascent puts Republicans in control of the White House for the first time in eight years. \n\"It all begins today!\" Trump tweeted at daybreak, before attending a morning service with his family as light rain fell. \"THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES – THE WORK BEGINS!\" \nTrump and his wife Melania then shuttled to the White House for the traditional private meeting of outgoing and incoming presidents and their spouses. Posing for photos on the North Portico, the couples exchanged hugs as Barack Obama chatted about the demands of protocol. \nThe Trumps and the Obamas were to travel together in the presidential limousine for the short trip later to the Capitol for the noon swearing-in ceremony. \nEbullient Trump supporters flocked to the nation's capital for the inaugural festivities, some wearing red hats emblazoned with his \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan. But in a sign of the deep divisions Trump sowed during his combative campaign, dozens of Democratic lawmakers were boycotting the swearing-in ceremony on Capitol Hill. \nSupporters were lined up at security checkpoints before dawn to take their places in this quadrennial rite of democracy.   \n\"I'm here for history,\" said Kevin Puchalski, a 24-year-old construction worker who drove from Philadelphia. \"This is the first president that I voted for that won.\" His big hope: Trump builds that promised wall on the US-Mexican border. \"Keep the illegals out,\" he said. \nProtesters, too, were out early, some trying to block inaugural visitors from passing through security checkpoints, some wearing orange jumpsuits with black hoods over their faces. Police in riot gear were out in force. \nEleanor Goldfield, who helped organize the Disrupt J20 protest, said demonstrators hope to show they will not be silent throughout Trump's presidency. She called Trump supporters \"misguided, misinformed or just plain dangerous.\" \nTrump aides said the president-elect had been personally invested in crafting his inaugural address, a relatively brief 20-minute speech that is expected to center on his vision for what it means to be an American. Spokesman Sean Spicer said the address would be \"less of an agenda and more of a philosophical document.\" \nTrump has pledged to upend some of Obama's major domestic and national security policies, including repealing his signature health care law and building a wall along the entire US-Mexico border. But he's offered few details of how he plans to accomplish his agenda, often sending contradictory signals. \nThe three days of inaugural festivities kicked off Thursday. Trump left his Trump-branded jet in New York and flew to Washington in a government plane, saluting an Air Force officer as he descended the steps with his wife, Melania. He and the incoming vice president, Mike Pence, solemnly laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery before joining supporters for an evening concert at the Lincoln Memorial. \nTrump's son, Don Jr., told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that as the various festivities got underway, \"the magnitude of it all\" was at last sinking in. He pronounced his father \"ready to take office.\" \n\"We're going to unify our country,\" Trump said at the close of the two-hour concert featuring country star Toby Keith, soul's Sam Moore and The Piano Guys. But not singer Jennifer Holliday: She backed out after an outcry from Trump critics. \nWith rain a possibility, the National Park Service announced that it was easing its \"no umbrella\" policy for Friday, allowing collapsible umbrellas along the parade route and on the National Mall. \nThe nation's soon-to-be president joked about the chance of a downpour. \"That's OK,\" Trump told campaign donors at an event Thursday night, \"because people will realize it's my real hair.\" \n\"Might be a mess, but they're going to see that it's my real hair,\" he said. \nWhatever the weather, Trump supporters were looking ahead to the day. \nChris Lehmann, 55, a maintenance supervisor from Belmar, New Jersey, said: \"I'm so excited, I'm like, on top of the world.\" \nEleanor Haven, 83, of Alexander City, Alabama, was attending the festivities with her son, Scott Haven. The pair said they had never been to a political event before attending a Trump \"thank you\" tour rally in Alabama after the election and were looking forward to Friday's celebration. \n\"We're excited for changes in the country,\" Scott Haven said. \nCelebrities were weighing in from all parts of the globe. Matthew McConaughey, in London to promote movies, stressed a need for acceptance, saying, \"The votes came in, the peaceful transfer of power should happen today and we all need to embrace that.\" James Taylor, a vocal Trump critic, emailed a video postcard from his vacation in French Polynesia, saying that on the last day of the Obama administration, \"it feels like it's raining all over the world.\" \nOn the eve of the inauguration, protesters and Trump supporters clashed outside a pro-Trump event Thursday night, with police using chemical spray to try control demonstrators outside the \"DeploraBall.\" The name was a play on a campaign remark by Hillary Clinton, who once referred to some Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables.\" \nAll of the living American presidents were scheduled to attend the swearing in ceremony, except for 92-year-old George H.W. Bush, who was hospitalized this week with pneumonia. His wife, Barbara, was also admitted to the hospital after falling ill. Trump tweeted his well-wishes to the Bushes, saying he was \"looking forward to a speedy recovery.\" \nClinton, Trump's vanquished campaign rival, also planned to join dignitaries at Capitol Hill. \nWhile Trump revels in a celebratory lunch with lawmakers and parade up Pennsylvania Avenue — passing his newly opened Washington hotel — workers at the White House will set about the frantic process of moving out the Obamas and preparing the residence for its new occupants. Moving trucks were on standby Friday morning at the White House. \nObama, who will continue to live in Washington, was leaving town with his family after the inauguration for a vacation in Palm Springs, California. He planned to address a farewell gathering of staff at Joint Base Andrews before boarding his last flight on the military aircraft that ferries presidents on their travels. \nObama began his day with a final visit to the Oval Office and goodbye tweets echoing a farewell letter he had penned to the American people. \n\"I won't stop,\" he tweeted. \"I'll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T06:41:11.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
