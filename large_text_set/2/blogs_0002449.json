Anya, among others, to urgently wade into the matter. \nPresident of the WIYC, Pastor Chibuzor Isiguzoro, said in Enugu, that the two governors were not good role models for the Igbo youths and urged the elders and other Igbo senior citizens to intervene in the dispute. \nThe group said the altercations between the two oldest governors in the South-East were “disgraceful and a slap on the entire Igbo land.” \nDescribing the development as a show of shame, the group said: “It is even more painful considering the personalities involved in this mess. These are people who, by virtue of their office should have exhibited ‘excellent’ behaviours. Okorocha, Obiano \n“As youths, we also look forward to leaders who will give us a sense of direction; leaders who will mentor the youths and leaders who will sharpen the youths for a better tomorrow. \n“But as it is today, we now have leaders who are taking the youths on a journey to nowhere, leaders who are displaying destructive examples.” \nOkorocha demands apology from Obiano \nMeantime, Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State, yesterday, called on his Anambra State, counterpart Governor Willie Obiano, to immediately tender an apology to him (Okorocha). \nOkorocha said Obiano has tactically withdrawn from the media battle which he (Obiano) initiated. \nThrough a release issued by Okorocha’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo, in Owerri, the governor gave conditions for an end to the media battle. \nOne of such conditions was that after apologizing to Okorocha, that Obiano should publish his achievements as requested by Imo governor. \nThis came after Obiano’s recent reply to Okorocha, that “I am so busy with issues of governance, providing qualitative service and abundant democracy dividends and has no spare time for unnecessary politically motivated distractions.” \nAccording to Onwuemeodo’s release, “Governor Obiano came up with this volte-face after he had launched unprovoked media attacks against the Imo governor. \n“And allowing Governor Obiano to tactically withdraw from an unwarranted media war he declared, without apologizing to Governor Okorocha and without publishing his achievements as the governor of Anambra State for almost four years is totally unacceptable to us. \n“And we make bold to ask for an unreserved apology from him because with the way he reacted to such an innocent comment, one could see that he was harbouring malice against Owelle Okorocha.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:47:13.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
