And why should they? It’s not often politicians are that good looking (or attractive at all). Plus, America’s having a bit of a rough moment right now, and Trudeau-envy is real in some corners of the internet. This week, it’s a picture of Justin Trudeau’s butt that has people all over Twitter trying to catch their breath.\nPhoebe Robinson, one of the “2 Dope Queens,” found the image and posted it to Instagram, writing, “How he gon stand there with his donk looking like it’s the last corner piece of Thanksgiving sweet potato pie that I know I better not touch or I’ll get cut by my auntie? How he gon pose like this he don’t know this the pose that’s gonna make women risk it all to trash his marriage like a raccoon does a garbage pail?” \nActually, her comments might be better ( almost ; calm down) than the tush itself. She adds, “This the kind of pose that got you waking up at 3:16am, mad AF at your boo sleeping next to you for not looking this good. This the kind of pose that make you convert to Buddhism and got you like, “A’ight, bet. I’mma about to come back in another life as a pant pocket on a pair of Brooks Brothers slacks in Trudeau’s closet.”\nHow he gon stand there with his donk looking like it's the last corner piece of Thanksgiving sweet potato pie that I know I better not touch or I'll get cut by my auntie?

Bless this photo, bless his body, and bless my eyeballs for being able to witness it. #YQY #JustinTrudeau #EverydayIsButtAndThighDayInTheTrudeauHousehold #ThisPostIsHighKeyDisrespectful \nA post shared by Phoebe Robinson (@dopequeenpheebs) on Feb 24, 2017 at 6:14am PST \nRobinson is totally right. That’s exactly what that pose is. You have to admit it, even if you’re not into Trudeau or really the butt-loving type, that’s a good butt. It’s totally disrespectful (please note Robinson’s #ThisPostIsHighKeyDisrespectful) but the internet being what it is, people totally agree with her. \nRaise your hand if you've been personally victimized by Justin Trudeau's butt. pic.twitter.com/ActAapfo4s \n— Oddity (@TraceOddity) February 24, 2017 at least we all got to talk about justin trudeau's butt this week so it wasn't all bad\n— Adam Smith (@asmith83) February 24, 2017 Justin Trudeau's butt makes me believe in happiness.\n— rachel leishman (@RachelLeishman) February 25, 2017 I had nightmares about Trudeau's butt. Thanks Internet.\n— Ro. (@olivesunset) February 25, 2017 Me: Why is everybody posting photos of Justin Trudeau's butt, it's just a butt, c'mon.\nMe, five minutes later: What is this butt sorcery\n— Andi Zeisler (@andizeisler) February 24, 2017 Somewhere, in a Canadian province, Justin Trudeau is blushing. No one can get over Trudeau’s good looks. Earlier this month when he visited the White House, there were pictures of Ivanka Trump looking dreamily at the Canadian leader.\nFind someone as thirsty for you as Ivanka Trump is for Justin Trudeau. pic.twitter.com/8DdIM3lnfu \n— Keylor Halbur (@keylor_halbur) February 23, 2017 When he visited Germany, Angela Merkel, who seems to sort of never smile, was basically giggling…at the Holocaust Memorial. Who needs Angelina Jolie and brad Pitt when you have Trudeau and Merkel pic.twitter.com/FfHVyO1853 \n— Erika (@ZBionic) February 17, 2017 They might have even played footsie. Never thought I'd be jealous of Angela Merkel but here we go... candlelight dinner with Justin Trudeau.\nIs #JoeTrudeau still available? pic.twitter.com/BSfch1skMN \n— Aaron Idstein (@titularninja) February 17, 2017 There was a chance that Trudeau isn’t as attractive as we all think he is, and it’s just the fact that he’s better looking than any of our other options. But this butt picture blows that theory out of the water. Trudeau is one fine-looking man and that butt is just the icing on the cake. The fact that he also seems to not be an a-hole is just a bonus.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:00:50.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
