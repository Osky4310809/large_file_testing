Turns out there’s a scholarship for that. \nWe Canadians have like to complain about our undergrad university fees being somewhere in the ballpark range of $6,000 . But that's nothing compared to the US, where it's possible to burn a $35, 000-sized hole into your wallet . No wonder people are paying off student loans well into their 30s. \nGetting funding for schooling is hard as it is, given how strict loan requirements and popular scholarship standards are. But as it turns out, there actually are scholarships for virtually anyone… just not the ones you expected . Do you know how to make a mean PB&J sandwich? Are you a pro at bowling? There's a scholarship for basically anything under the sun and you will be rewarded for all the weird but cool shit you can do. \nWe at VICE have compiled a brief guide of the weirdest online scholarships to help you because hey, why not get rewarded for being passionate about potatoes . Zombie Apocalypse Scholarship (Yes, really.) \nThis is basically Community 's \"Epidemiology\" episode brought to life. This scholarship asks you to think about what you'd do if your school's campus was infected with a zombie virus and you were the lone survivor. Don't smirk just yet… $2000 is up for grabs with this one. Just keep an eye out for any Leonards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:09:28.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
