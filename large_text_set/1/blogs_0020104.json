It’s been years since it has received an update, and this new version for Android, iOS and the web includes an all-new user interface, as well as a few other tweaks long-time Voice users will appreciate.\nSee also: How to create an SMS app October 13, 2016 \nGoogle says that users will now see separate tabs for texts, calls and voicemails in their Google Voice inbox. In addition, group texting is now supported, with no need to use Hangouts. Also, Voice users can finally send photo MMS messages, which is something that’s been requested for a long time. The voicemail translation features have also been expanded to include support for Spanish.\nGoogle is also working with wireless service providers to add RCS (Rich Communications Services) features to Google Voice sometime in the future.\n\nThe big Google Voice update is naturally coming to the Android mobile client first, followed by the iOS version and the web. The new look and features should be available for all users in the coming weeks. If you’re using Google Voice via Hangouts , the company says there is no immediate need to check out the update, but suggests that those users might want to try it out for size. Google claims that there will be new versions of Google Voice on a regular basis from now on, instead of waiting five years between updates.\nAre you a Google Voice user, or have you abandoned the platform just like Google seemingly did for years?
