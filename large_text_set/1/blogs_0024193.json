By Reuters On 1/30/17 at 8:39 AM Close Quebec mosque shooting: Gunmen kill at least 5 in Canada \nSix people were killed and eight wounded when gunmen opened fire at a Quebec City mosque during Sunday night prayers, in what Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a \"terrorist attack on Muslims\". \nPolice said two suspects had been arrested, but gave no details about them or what prompted the attack.

Police said only two people were involved in the attack. \n\"Six people are confirmed dead - they range in age from 35 to about 70,\" Quebec provincial police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe told reporters, adding eight people were wounded and 39 were unharmed. \nThe mosque 's president, Mohamed Yangui, who was not inside when the shooting occurred, said he got frantic calls from people at evening prayers. \n\"Why is this happening here? This is barbaric,” he said. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement: \"We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge\". \n“Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country.\" \nThe shooting came on the weekend that Trudeau said Canada would welcome refugees, after U.S. President Donald Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program and temporarily barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States on national security grounds. \nA Canadian federal Liberal legislator, Greg Fergus, tweeted: \"This is an act of terrorism -- the result of years of sermonizing Muslims. Words matter and hateful speeches have consequences!\" \nThe premier of Quebec province, Philippe Couillard, said security would be increased at mosque s in Quebec City and Montreal. \n\"We are with you. You are home,\" Couillard said, directing his comments at the province's Muslim community. \"You are welcome in your home. We are all Quebecers. We must continue together to build an open welcoming and peaceful society\". \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio said police were providing additional protection for mosque s in that city following the Quebec shooting. \"All New Yorkers should be vigilant. If you see something, say something,\" he tweeted. \nFrench President Francois Hollande condemned the attack. \n\"The terrorists wanted to attack the spirit of peace and tolerance of the citizens of Quebec,\" Hollande said in a statement on Monday. \"France stands shoulder to shoulder with the victims and their families\". \nLike France, Quebec has struggled at times to reconcile its secular identity with a rising Muslim population, many of them from North Africa. \nIn June last year, a pig’s head was left on the doorstep of the cultural center. \n\"We are not safe here,\" said Mohammed Oudghiri, who normally attends prayers at the mosque in the middle-class, residential area, but did not on Sunday. \nOudghiri said he had lived in Quebec for 42 years but was now \"very worried\" and thinking of moving back to Morocco. \nMass shootings are rare in Canada, which has stricter gun laws than the United States, and news of the shooting sent a shockwave through mosque s and community centers throughout the mostly French-language province. \n\"It’s a sad day for all Quebecers and Canadians to see a terrorist attack happen in peaceful Quebec City,\" said Mohamed Yacoub, co-chairman of an Islamic community center in a Montreal suburb. \n\"I hope it’s an isolated incident.\" \nIncidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. The face-covering, or niqab, became a big issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election, especially in Quebec, where the majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies. \nIn 2013, police investigated after a mosque in the Saguenay region of the province was splattered with what was believed to be pig blood. In the neighboring province of Ontario, a mosque was set on fire in 2015, a day after an attack by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris. \nZebida Bendjeddou, who left the Quebec City mosque earlier on Sunday evening, said the center had received threats. \n\"In June, they'd put a pig's head in front of the mosque . But we thought: 'Oh, they're isolated events.' We didn't take it seriously. But tonight, those isolated events, they take on a different scope,\" she said. \nBendjeddou said she had not confirmed the names of those killed, but added: \"They're people we know, for sure. People we knew since they were little kids.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T12:58:54.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
