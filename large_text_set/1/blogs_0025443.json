Mr Blankfein has expressed bemusement to colleagues over how Mrs May appears to treat finance like any other industry, despite its major contribution to the UK economy and its exchequer. \nBankers looked on enviously in October when Mrs May gave Nissan a guarantee that its terms of trade would not be hurt by Brexit, winning a commitment from the Japanese carmaker to expand production at its plant in Sunderland. \nMrs May's meeting with Wall Street executives came only hours after her address to the Davos elite, outlining plans for the UK to \"step up to a new leadership role\" in the global economy after Brexit and remain a \"great global trading nation\". \nSome foreign bank bosses were still reeling from an earlier speech by her in London, in which she confirmed for the first time that the UK would not be staying in the EU's single market or customs union. City bankers fear this outcome could cut them off from EU clients. show chapters Friday, 27 Jan 2017 | 1:26 PM ET | 03:00 \nA number of financiers spoke publicly at Davos about their plans to move thousands of jobs out of London as they prepared for a \"hard Brexit\", including the heads of HSBC, UBS and JPMorgan Chase. \nMr Blankfein told Bloomberg TV that his bank was already \"slowing down\" its recent shift of resources to the UK because of the referendum decision. He said immigration had to be Mrs May's \"declared priority\" but he believed \"the financial services industry is so important to the British economy . . . so that will become an important priority\". \nAlso meeting Mrs May in Davos were Larry Fink of BlackRock, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, James Gorman of Morgan Stanley, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. All parties declined to comment. \nSeveral of the executives came away from the event impressed by Mrs May's grasp of the detail about how the City could be affected by Brexit. \"She is on top of her brief,\" said one person involved. \nThe prime minister also had a one-to-one meeting with Mr Schwarzman to discuss the best way to approach Donald Trump, ahead of her meeting with the new US president last Friday. \nThe Blackstone boss chairs Mr Trump's new strategic and policy forum, which provides the president with advice from US business leaders. \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .
