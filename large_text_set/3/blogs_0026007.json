And they’re rather stunning as you’ll see in the gallery at the bottom of this page. \nThe 18-hour limited event Showtime series will debut with a two-hour premiere on Sunday, May 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. Immediately following the Twin Peaks premiere, Showtime subscribers will have access to the third and fourth hours, exclusively across the Showtime streaming service, Showtime Anytime and Showtime On Demand. \nIn its second week, Twin Peaks will air the third and fourth hours back-to-back on the linear network, starting at 9 p.m. ET/PT, followed by one-hour episodes in subsequent weeks. \nDirected entirely by Lynch (“It’s an 18 hour movie!” says the filmmaker), the new Showtime limited event series picks up twenty-five years after the inhabitants of a quaint northwestern town were stunned when their homecoming queen Laura Palmer was shockingly murdered. \nTwin Peaks is written and executive produced by series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost, and is executive produced by Sabrina S. Sutherland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T19:04:44.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
