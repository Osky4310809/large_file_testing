There’s something beautiful about closure,” Ian continued. “It’s never going to die. We’re going to continue to be able to watch it and I think that’s a really interesting new thing about this modern digital world.”\nPaul joked, “It’d be funny if we did a reboot [where] we’re all old as sh-t.”\nThe Vampire Diaries series finale airs Friday, March 10 @ 8PM on The CW.\nMORE: Damon & Elena Hug in New Vampire Diaries Series Finale Promo – Watch Now!
