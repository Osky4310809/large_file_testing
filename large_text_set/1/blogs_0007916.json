(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \nFREEPORT, Maine (AP) — L.L. Bean likes to stay out of politics, yet a donation by a member of the Bean family is putting the retailer on the defensive. \nThe Maine-based company issued a statement late Sunday after being targeted for boycott for alleged ties to Republican President-elect Donald Trump. \nThe founders of the hashtag #GrabYourWallet included Bean on the list after The Associated Press reported that L.L. Bean’s granddaughter, Linda Bean, contributed $60,000 to a political action committee supporting Trump. The donation exceeded the PAC’s contribution limit. \nBean Chairman Shawn Gorman said he’s “deeply troubled by the portrayal of L.L. Bean as a supporter of any political agenda.” He said there are nine other board members and 50 family owners and that Linda Bean’s donation shouldn’t speak for all of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:21:14.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
