Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThere’s a movement underway to get one more no vote against President Trump’s choice to head the Department of Education, Betsy DeVos, and liberals think Sen. Marco Rubio can be their hero: Dear @MarcoRubio the GOP needs a new star & you could be it! Show your strength & independence & vote #noDevos ! \nPlease RT \n— Krista Vernoff (@KristaVernoff) February 7, 2017 \nGood luck with that. Remember when then candidate Rubio said he didn’t trust Trump with the nuclear codes? \nActor Mark Ruffalo joined in on the effort, appealing to the senator because he has kids: Come on Marco, know where you stand and actually STAND there! You got kids. They have friends. You know better. https://t.co/CYzfZd8SMI \n— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) February 7, 2017 Trending Backfire alert! Dems given a clue what the 'Resistance' is REALLY doing \nAnd if it’s not Rubio to the rescue, Ruffalo is hoping Sen. McCain might step up: Come on Senator! You are quickly becoming one of the only voices of reason in your party these days. #ToughTalk it. https://t.co/KDzjvWKuDB \n— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) February 7, 2017 \nOr Sen. Lindsey Graham: Come on @LindseyGrahamSC you will be the winner when this is all over. You saw through the bull early. Keep it up. https://t.co/mERrrBqCGH \n— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) February 7, 2017 \nOr anyone! \n— Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) February 7, 2017 \nHere’s a hint, Hollywood: If you want more from Republican politicians, maybe don’t go to 11 on every friggin’ issue and they’ll listen? \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:24:20.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
