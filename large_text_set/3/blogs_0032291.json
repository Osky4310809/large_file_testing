After some serious backlash, United is now assuring customers their \"leggings are welcome.\"\nSEE ALSO: United Airlines bans 2 girls with leggings from flight because they weren't 'properly clothed'\nIn a statement shared on United's website Monday morning, the airline set out to explain its decision to prevent the girls from boarding.\n\"We care about the way we present ourselves to you, our customers, as we believe that is part of the experience on board our flights,\" United wrote.\nThe airline went on to explain the reason the two girls were scrutinized for their fashion choice is because they were \" pass riders ,\" also known as friends or relatives of United employees who receive free or heavily discounted air travel and have a separate dress code they must adhere to.\n1) A @united gate agent isn't letting girls in leggings get on flight from Denver to Minneapolis because spandex is not allowed?\nâ€” Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 26, 2017\nThe passengers this morning were United pass riders who were not in compliance with our dress code policy for company benefit travel.\nâ€” United (@united) March 26, 2017\n\"When taking advantage of this benefit, all employees and pass riders are considered representatives of United. And like most companies, we have a dress code that we ask employees and pass riders to follow\" the statement read.\n\"The passengers this morning were United pass riders and not in compliance with our dress code for company benefit travel. We regularly remind our employees that when they place a family member or friend on a flight for free as a standby passenger, they need to follow our dress code.\"\nIn relation to those not flying on standby, the airline said it is perfectly fine to wear your active wear: \"To our regular customers, your leggings are welcome.\"\nMeanwhile, Delta used this time to remind passengers that its airline fully condones comfort, and therefore, leggings are always welcome.\nFlying Delta means comfort. (That means you can wear your leggings. ðŸ˜‰)\nâ€” Delta (@Delta) March 27, 2017\nUnited told 9 News that although the dress code for pass riders will remain an \"internal policy,\" it is separate and unrelated to safety-related dress code guidelines on United's website, which state a regular passenger may be refused or removed from a flight if they are \"barefoot or not properly clothed.\"\nMashable reached out to United for additional comment and is awaiting response.\nWATCH: Airbus is redefining the future of flying.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Delta/status/846393226890280966", "https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx#sec21", "https://twitter.com/shannonrwatts", "http://www.9news.com/news/travel/united-says-leggings-are-still-welcome-on-flights/425669408", "https://twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/845992819894321153", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/rbwBcBFG.jpg", "https://twitter.com/united/status/846065666922811393", "https://hub.united.com/our-customers-leggings-are-welcome-2331263786.html", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/rbwBcBFG.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/united", "https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/flightstatus/standby_FAQ.aspx"], "published": "2017-03-28T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T20:30:01.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
