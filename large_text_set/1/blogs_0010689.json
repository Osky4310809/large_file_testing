It alleges that Michael Cohen, special counsel to Trump, was central to “the ongoing secret liaison relationship between the New York tycoon’s campaign and the Russian leadership,” and that he met secretly with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016.\nReached by telephone on Tuesday night, Cohen denied the dossier’s allegations.\nThe story is “totally fake, totally inaccurate,” Cohen said.\n“I’m telling you emphatically that I’ve not been to Prague, I’ve never been to Czech [Republic], I’ve not been to Russia,” Cohen said. “The story is completely inaccurate, it is fake news meant to malign Mr. Trump.”\nCohen said that in the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach. He said that his only trip to an EU country over the summer had been a vacation to Italy in July.\nCohen also tweeted a photo of his passport: “I have never been to Prague in my life. #fakenews .” Trump retweeted Cohen’s tweet.\nThe document, a synopsis of which CNN reported had been shown to both Trump and President Obama, comes at an awkward time for Trump, who is scheduled to give a long-awaited press conference in New York on Wednesday.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:50:29.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
