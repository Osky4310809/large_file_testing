Mark Ogden discusses whether now would be the right time for Wayne Rooney to leave Manchester United. Jose Mourinho coyly answers questions on Wayne Rooney's future with Man United, but says he wants him to remain at the club. \nWayne Rooney's agent, Paul Stretford, is in China to assess the options open to the Manchester United forward should he leave Old Trafford at the end of the season, a source has told ESPN FC. \nStretford, who is also attending to business relating to his China-based multi-media company, Red Lantern, has spent time speaking to interested Chinese Super League clubs, with sources telling ESPN FC that \"due diligence\" is required before any decision is made over a possible move there by Rooney. \nSources continue to insist that any move before the Feb. 28 transfer deadline remains highly unlikely, with Rooney determined to ensure that any potential departure from United is the correct one for his family. \nThe 31-year-old has yet to be told by United that he can leave Old Trafford, but having lost his regular starting position under Jose Mourinho, he is aware of interest from several overseas clubs. \nSources told ESPN FC on Wednesday that Rooney wants to stay at United until the end of the season and help the club pursue silverware on three fronts before considering a move to the CSL or Major League Soccer. \nA move to MLS is a possibility, although such a deal would prove difficult to negotiate if United demand a fee for a player whose Â£300,000-a-week contract runs until June 2018. \nTwo top-flight clubs -- Jiangsu Suning and Beijing Guoan -- currently have an available space for an overseas player, but Jiangsu boss Fabio Cannavaro has said his club does not plan to pursue a deal for Rooney , while the BBC reported that Beijing are not interested. \nMark Ogden is a senior football writer for ESPN FC.
