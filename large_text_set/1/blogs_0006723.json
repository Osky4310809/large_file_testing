A concept smartphone from the Taiwanese vendor, it was accidently leaked by an HTC designer earlier. But now it appears that the HTC Ocean will soon become a reality, thanks to a leaked promo video that comes courtesy of gadget tipster Evan Blass. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 8, 2017 The video shows a smartphone with touch-sensitive side panels, that will allow users to perform various tasks like access apps, change volume, summon Google voice search and snap images. The phone is also expected to bring some interesting camera specs as well. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 8, 2017 \nThe other leaked video gives us a glimpse of HTC’s new CMF project. Similar to Motorola’s MotoMaker, CMF will provide a range of finishes and textures for HTC phones, which users will be able to customise.Neither the HTC Ocean nor CMF have been confirmed by the company so far. We might get a glimpse of them at HTC’s upcoming launch event on January 12th, or in February at MWC.
