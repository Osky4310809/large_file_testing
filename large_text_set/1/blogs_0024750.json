Beaten by Pogba. \nMeyler 5 - Given a tough time down his flank by Rashford. \nMaguire 6 - Blasted an effort over early on. Won penalty. \nDawson 6 - Defending resolutely and pushed forward when he could. \nTymon 7 - Made some dangerous darting runs and caused problems. \nMaloney 6 - Was at the heart of Hull's best moves but faded. \nHuddlestone 7 - Dispatched clinical first-half penalty to give Hull hope. Huddlestone gave Hull belief with his first-half penalty (Photo: REUTERS) \nClucas 6 - Tested De Gea early on with a fierce dipping free-kick. \nDiomande 6 - Suffered a knock just after the restart but hobbled along. \nNiasse 6 - Won an early free-kick and was a thorn in United's side. Scored to give Hull win on the night. \nBowen 6 - Caused United problems with his quick feet. Subbed. \nSubs: Markovic 5 (Bowen, 59), Evandro 5 (Maloney, 64), Hernandez 5 (Diomande, 70) Man United \nDe Gea 6 - Punched away two goal-bound efforts. No chance with penalty. \nDarmian 5 - Given a tough time by Tymon. Poor control going forward. Matteo Darmian offered little offensively or defensively for the visitors (Photo: PA) \nJones 6 - Made some key blocks. Cautioned for early foul on Niasse. \nSmalling 6 - Produced a crucial last-ditch tackle on Dawson. \nRojo 5 - Conceded needless penalty. Hit bar with header. \nCarrick 6 - Anchored midfield with assurance and composure. \nHerrera 6 - Typically industrious on 100th United appearance. \nLingard 5 - Unable to convert half-chance just before the break. \nPogba 6 - Quiet until he scored the goal that eased United's nerves.

Had role in Pogba's goal. \nIbrahimovic 6 - Saw first-half effort saved. Played part in build-up to goal. \nSubs: Rooney 5 (Lingard, 77), Fellaini N/A (Rashford, 90) poll loading Who will win the EFL Cup final? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T00:29:59.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
