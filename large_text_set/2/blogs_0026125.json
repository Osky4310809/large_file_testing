Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has impressed in recent games when given the chance to play centrally, but Wenger is still searching for his best midfield partnership in Cazorla's absence. \nThe Gunners don't have a game this weekend but travel to Liverpool next Saturday before taking on Bayern Munich in the return leg of their Champions League round-of-16 tie.
