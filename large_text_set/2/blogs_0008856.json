Ruiz was particularly angry at how the former reality TV star has insulted migrants.\nOne marcher carried a larger-than-life painted Trump mannequin, portraying him as an outlandish cartoon character, while others carried pi?atas resembling the U.S. leader wearing floppy Mexican hats bearing pro- Mexico slogans.\n“Mexicans demand respect, we want bridges not walls,” read one banner carried by nearby marchers. “Trump you diminish America,” read another.\nMaria Paro Cassar, an organizer, said Trump has made Mexico and Mexicans in the United States “his favorite target.”\n“His policies are a global threat that go against pluralism and diversity and they represent a particular threat to Mexico ,” she added.\nThree weeks into his administration, Trump has vowed to move ahead with construction of his signature border wall, which he has repeatedly said Mexico will pay for, as well as signaling a new push to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants from the country.\n\nWhile organizers of the marches promoted them as non-partisan, many singled out Pena Nieto as a major obstacle.\n“We’re also marching today to demand that our own rulers put an end to corruption and so much loss of life here and actually look out for the good of the country, not just themselves,” said 28-year-old office worker Victor Robledo.\nLast month, a poll showed that Pena Nieto’s approval ratings had hit a record low at just 12 percent, the lowest level of support for any president in decades.\n“We as Mexicans have to demand that Pena Nieto defends us and acts with dignity,” said Mari Carmen Quiroz, a 51-year-old university professor. “Unfortunately, so far he’s done a bad job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:37:18.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
