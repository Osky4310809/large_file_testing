It’s looking increasingly unlikely due to an ankle injury that has kept him out of training all week. \nU.S. manager Bruce Arena described Morris as “day-to-day” on Thursday, as he has all week. Morris hasn’t trained with the team yet, instead doing work with the medical staff as he tries to deal with an ankle sprain he suffered while playing with the Seattle Sounders last week. \nArena said that a decision on Morris’ availability would be made on Friday, so he hasn’t been ruled out, but the lack of training casts serious doubt on his availability. At this point, it’s tough to imagine him making the 23-man gameday roster, let alone playing. \nLosing Morris would be a big blow to the U.S. attack. It’s possible that he would have started in place of Bobby Wood, who is out for the match with a back injury. Even if he didn’t, he would have been a potent option off the bench. \nArena has repeatedly praised Morris, highlighting his pace and strength as a weapon that he likes to have at his disposal. Especially late in matches when opposing defenses are tired, Morris can be a real asset and the U.S. boss has specifically talked about the variety of ways the forward can be used. \nThe absence of Morris would be especially tough considering the other injuries that the U.S. is dealing with. Wood is out, but so is Fabian Johnson, taking away another attacking option. Gyasi Zardes didn’t get called in as he recovers from knee surgery, too. \nIf Morris is out, Arena’s forward options would be Jozy Altidore, the red hot front man who is almost a certainty to start, Clint Dempsey, who is recovering from a heart condition and whose ability to go 90 minutes for the U.S. is in question, and Chris Wondolowski, who was only called in as a late addition when Morris’ availability became a concern. That’s hardly ideal for the U.S., but that’s what they have at their disposal unless Morris goes from not training with the team all week to playing. \nMORE FROM FOX SOCCER", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:20:29.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
