Once inside, an amalgam of old and young, male and female. Carlton, Collingwood and others filled the stands. \nIkon Park looked glorious, with the sun and city backdrop making this a stage worthy of such a historic occasion. \nMATCH: CARLTON V COLLINGWOOD \nTwo old foes were going into battle, but the personnel dictated this rivalry was about to take another turn. \nThat was obvious when signs saying ‚Äúgo Aunty Stacey‚Äù were being ushered through gate five. Even more so when Collingwood jumpers adorned with Mo Hope badges stood in line to order some chips. The first bounce. Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia \nCarlton is first on the ground to warm up and Ikon Park welcomes its Blues with a loud cheer. \nBut there‚Äôs an undertone of boos from the Collingwood cheer squad ‚Äî just in case you forgot we‚Äôre now playing for premiership points. \nFast forward 30 minutes and it‚Äôs go time. \nCollingwood runs through its banner, which falls one way and then the other, but somehow manages to stand up. \nThen its Carlton‚Äôs turn and if you closed your eyes you‚Äôd be forgiven you‚Äôre back in the ‚Äò90s. \nThere‚Äôs something magical about hearing the ‚ÄúNavy Blues‚Äù blasted, perhaps because the sound that resonates from the crowd is as passionate as ever. \nJasmine Garner slots the first goal of the competition and the roar confirms one thing: The people have voted with their feet. \nThen an announcement across the speaker confirms another: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a lock out.‚Äù \nWe‚Äôre no longer waiting. People resorting to standing in the walkways... we're now offiially at fire danger point üòÇüòÇ #AFLWBluesPies pic.twitter.com/MUFHgFM2Y0 ‚Äî Matt Walsh (@MattWalshMedia) February 3, 2017 View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
