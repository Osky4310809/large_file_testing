I tried to ask the driver but he couldn’t really speak English. \n\"I have no memory of it stopping and I didn’t get out of the car.” \nThe computer science student insists the driver confirmed the Croydon postcode before they set off at 3.20am on Sunday. \nHe said he only realised the size of the detour - and his bill - when he finally made it home. \nBut Uber claimed the taxi had been requested to Bristol, where Aaron goes to university.
