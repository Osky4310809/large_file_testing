He walked just one and whiffed seven. More important, he commanded all four of his pitches — fastball, slider, curve and changeup. \n“One thinking I’ve been working on lately is my slider,” Gray said. “It still don’t feel like it’s at its best right now, but I’ve made some tweaks to it and it was better today. On a good note, the changeup worked well and so did the curveball.” \nBOXSCORE: Rockies 9, Athletics 2 \nAdded manager Bud Black: “Early in the game, he had the good fastball-change combo going and threw some changeups to lefties that I thought were outstanding. … Jon is growing. That’s good to see.” \nHits: Blackmon, batting .471, hit a home run and a triple, driving in three runs. … Left fielder Gerardo Parra continued his solid spring, hitting 2-for-3 from the No. 5 hole, boosting his average to .371. … Right-handed reliever Adam Ottavino bounced back from two subpar outings to strike out two in his one inning of work. … Dunn, who has been has been almost perfect, pitched a scoreless eighth inning, allowing no baserunners and striking out one. In seven innings, Dunn has allowed no runs, no hits and just two walks while striking out nine.
