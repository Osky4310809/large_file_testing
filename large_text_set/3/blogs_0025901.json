He has since been transferred to a detention facility in Wisconsin, his family said, and is set to be deported on Friday. \nIronically, Beristain and his wife, Helen Beristain, supported President Donald Trump’s campaign and were glad to see him win the White House. They didn’t imagine his subsequent immigration enforcement orders would apply to cases like Roberto’s. \n“We were for Mr. Trump,” “We were very happy he became the president,” said Helen Beristain in an interview with a local Indiana TV station . “Whatever he says, he is right. But, like he said, the good people have a chance to become citizens of the United States.” \nFollowing through on a campaign promise to step up deportations of people living in the country without authorization, Trump issued guidance in February to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that expanded the categories of illegal immigrants who could be targeted for detention and removal. \nA DHS fact sheet states, “all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to enforcement proceedings” but placed an emphasis on illegal immigrants with criminal records.

According to his immigration lawyer, Adam Ansari, Beristain has a legal Social Security number, work permit and driver’s license. \nICE has been aware of those identity documents since 2000, when Beristain was issued a voluntary deportation order, Ansari said. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
