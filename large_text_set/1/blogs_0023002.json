He has shown again he is a top manager. We have seen with Pep [Guardiola, in his debut season across town at City] how difficult it is to get it right. Jose is doing that really well. \n\"He would want to be further up the table but you can see the characteristics of United of old. \n“I always thought at the beginning Jose had a really tough job — because of the squad. Not just because of the profile of the players but because of the mentality that was ingrained in those footballers. \n“The confidence levels were very low, the style of football they were taught play was alien to Manchester United in terms of the characteristics and history of the club. It is a big job, without even thinking what players he had there in terms of changing the whole psyche.\" \nUnited currently sit sixth — four points adrift of arch-rivals Liverpool, who occupy the final Champions League place.

United need to finish in the top four this season, but it will be difficult. It is tight there, They are fighting with Liverpool and City. \n“I hope they finish in the top four. But it is so difficult. United have not lost in 17 games but have drawn a lot. I would rather lose a few and get wins, in terms of points. That has been the frustrating thing.

If they want to finish in the top four they have to defend diligently and take their chances. \n\"It is not rocket science.” \nFerdinand has also claimed former team-mate Wayne Rooney does not get the appreciation he deserves in his own country, even after becoming breaking Sir Bobby Charlton's records to become all-time top scorer for England and now United. \n“I think he’s appreciated more on the continent than he is in this country. That’s a shame because a lot of foreign teams would loved to have taken him many times,” said Ferdinand. \n“They’d see he wasn’t just an out-and-out striker, he wasn’t just a ten, he was a combination of both.
