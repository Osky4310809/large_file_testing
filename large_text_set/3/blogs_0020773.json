The FC guys discuss the influx of incorrect calls in the Prem this season and wonder if the officiating quality has gone down. \nIt has the look of a draconian crackdown. This week, Manchester City were charged by the Football Association for failing to control their players during their 1-1 draw with Liverpool. Last week, Manchester United were fined Â£20,000 for the same offence against Chelsea in the FA Cup. In February, it was Hull City who felt the FA's wrath for their players' actions against Arsenal. \nThe governing body is moving quickly to stamp out dissent, but those who feel the action is unnecessary should take a look lower down the ladder in England, where the knock-on effects are being felt on a weekly basis. \nEarlier this month, Ryan Hampson, an 18-year-old referee from Manchester, organised a strike that saw 2,000 referees stand down and caused the cancellation of games across the country. The aim was to raise awareness, but he also wants the Football Association to supply body-cams (think of something like a GoPro) for officials to deter players from attacking them and to provide evidence to charge those who do. \nFor every offence that is punished there are several more that go unreported, or that come with insufficient tangible evidence to draw punishment, and something has to change. Some of the stories at the grassroots level of the game are horrifying. One amateur referee was told in no uncertain terms that he'd have his legs broken as punishment for a contentious call -- the threat, perhaps expected to be hurled anonymously from a furious mass at a league game, came from two fathers at an under-12's match in affluent Bournemouth. \nHampson has been head-butted and spat on by footballers and was once escorted from the pitch by one team because the other one wanted to assault him. \n\"The level of abuse and the assaults on referees across the UK is staggering,\" he told ESPN FC. \"Last year there were 111 proven assaults on referees. But my question to the FA when we met in January was: 'How many assaults weren't proven?' \n\"It's sad that it's come to this. How many other hobbies do you see where people have to wear body-cams? I get the passion, I really do understand that, however there's being passionate and there's being a thug, because that's all you are really. Off the pitch you wouldn't behave like that. \n\"I've been head-butted, spat at and punched, and that's just to name a few things that have happened to me. And people have said to me: 'Oh well, obviously you can't officiate a game.' But I'm a Level 5 referee, going for Level 4 at the age of 18. I've had nine assessments and they've all had me above standard.\" \nHampson has little doubt as to where much of the blame lies. He believes the behaviour of professional footballers has a direct effect on the behaviour of amateurs, and that the lack of serious punishment only encourages worse behaviour. \n\"Look at [Aston Villa's] Leandro Bacuna the other week [sent off for barging into an assistant referee]. He got a four-game ban [Actually six]. A four-game ban? What good is that? Okay, he said sorry, but he still went into that assistant referee's face, knowing the assistant referee can't react. \n\"I guarantee he would not have gone up to someone like Joey Barton in the face. These people would not do that to any other player on the pitch. But they'll do it to the referee because he's an easy target.\" Officials across the country are subject to abuse on a weekly basis. \nAnd it isn't just the players. Anyone who has ever sat near the technical area at a Premier League game will recognise how thankless the fourth official's job can be. It might be easier, and more effective, simply to install a punchbag between the dug-outs. \nMost of these tantrums go unnoticed, shrugged off by officials accustomed to their lot. Sometimes, however, reactions are so spectacular they have to be reported. \nWhen former Notts County boss John Sheridan erupted at referee Eddie Ilderton and fourth official Matthew Donohue last year, he earned himself a five-match ban. But Sheridan's expletive-riddled threat to \"knock out\" the officials will certainly ring true with referees further down the ladder. \nTim Sherwood, Director of Football at Swindon Town, was this week handed a two-match ban for sustained abuse of the referee at half-time of a game against Bury in February. \nHampson is keen to continue talks with the FA and believes they are willing to work with him to make improvements. For their part, the FA told ESPN FC they had a positive meeting with Hampson and they look forward to keeping the dialogue open with him. They may not have a choice in the matter. Hampson has no intention of stopping at body-cams. \n\"Once we get body-cams, I'm not going to go away,\" he said. \"I'm going to keep fighting. Grassroots referees are the referees who make sure you can play on a Saturday or a Sunday. They make sure that your family and friends can play football. \n\"Without grassroots referees, there is no grassroots football.\" \nIain Macintosh covers the Premier League and Champions League for ESPN FC.
