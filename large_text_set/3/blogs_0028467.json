Use Frozen Grated Butter \nJust freeze a stick of butter, then grate with a box grater. The cold grated butter will distribute through the dough evenly, resulting in a lighter, fluffier biscuit. 2. Stir Exactly 15 Times \nOnce you add the buttermilk, stir the mixture 15 timesâ€”no more, no less. Trust the Southern Living test kitchen: this is the magic number they found led to the best results. 3. Fold the Dough 4 Times \nRoll out the dough, fold it in half, then roll it out again. Do this 4 times to help create those flaky layers. (This is the same technique you'd use to make croissant dough.) \nWatch a quick how-to video to see how foolproof it is: \nThe Feast is Bravo's home for the biggest, boldest, most crave-worthy eating experiences.
