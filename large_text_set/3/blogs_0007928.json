The Frenchman was initially shown a yellow card but that was upgraded to a red much to the disbelief of the Arsenal players. Theo Walcott put Arsenal ahead on the night \nLewandowski stepped up to level the scores from the penalty spot before strikes from Arjen Robben, substitute Douglas Costa and Arturo Vidal (2) saw Carlo Ancelotti's side heap further humiliation on Arsene Wenger's side. \nThe 5-1 defeat is the biggest Arsenal have suffered at the Emirates and piles even more pressure on Wenger's position at the club. \nArsenal will look to avoid further embarrassment when they take on non-league Lincoln in the quarter-final of the FA Cup on Saturday, while Bayern await the draw for the next round which will take place on March 17. \nMore to follow...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:14:48.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
