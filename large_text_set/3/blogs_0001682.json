For example, the Ten Commandments give us a clear picture of God's laws. They offer basic rules of behavior for spiritual and moral living. Many other verses in the Bible present direct examples of sin, but how can we know if something is sin when the Bible is not clear? The Bible presents general guidelines to help us judge sin when we are uncertain. \nUsually, when we're in doubt over sin, our first tendency is to ask if something is bad or wrong. I'd like to suggest thinking in the opposite direction. Instead, ask yourself these questions based on Scripture: Is this a good thing for me and others? Is this beneficial? Will it draw me closer to God? Will it strengthen my faith and my witness? (1 Corinthians 10:23-24) The next great question to ask is, will this glorify God? Will God bless this thing and use it for his purposes? Will this be pleasing and honoring to God? (1 Corinthians 6:19â€“20; 1 Corinthians 10:31) You can also ask, how will this thing affect my family and friends? Although we may have freedom in Christ in an area, we are never to let our freedoms cause a weaker brother to stumble. (Romans 14:21; Romans 15:1) In addition, since the Bible teaches us to submit to those in authority over us (parents, a spouse, a teacher), we can ask, do my parents have a problem with this thing? Am I willing to submit this to those in leadership over me? Finally, in all things, we are to let our conscience before God convict us of what is right and wrong on matters that are not clear in the Bible. We can ask, do I have freedom in Christ and a clear conscience before the Lord to do whatever is in question? Are my own desire's submitted to the Lord's will? (Colossians 3:17, Romans 14:23) What Attitude Should We Have Toward Sin? \nThe truth is, we all sin. The Bible makes this apparent in Scriptures such as Romans 3:23 and 1 John 1:10. But the Bible also says that God hates sin and encourages us as Christians to stop sinning: \"Those who have been born into God's family do not make a practice of sinning, because God's life is in them.\" (1 John 3:9, NLT ) Further complicating the matter are Bible passages that seem to suggest that some sins are debatable, and that sin is not always \"black and white.\" What is sin for one Christian, for example, may not be sin for another Christian. So, in light of all of these considerations, what attitude should we have toward sin? What Attitude Should We Have Toward Sin? What Is the Unforgivable Sin? \nMark 3:29 says, \"But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin. (NIV) Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is also referenced in Matthew 12:31-32 and Luke 12:10. This question about the unforgivable sin has challenged and perplexed many Christians over the years. I believe, however, that the Bible provides a very simple explanation for this intriguing and often disturbing question about sin. What Is Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit? Are There Other Types of Sin? \nImputed Sin - Imputed sin is one of two effects that Adam's sin had on the human race. Original sin is the first effect. As a result of Adam's sin, all people enter the world with a fallen nature. In addition, the guilt of Adam's sin is credited not only to Adam but to every person who came after him. This is imputed sin. In other words, we all deserve the same punishment as Adam. Imputed sin destroys our standing before God, whereas original sin destroys our character. Both original and imputed sin place us under God's judgment. \nHere is an outstanding explanation of the difference between Original Sin and Imputed Sin from Desiring God Ministry. Sins of Omission and Commission - These sins refer to personal sins. A sin of commission is something we do (commit) by the act of our will against the command of God. A sin of omission is when we fail to do something commanded by God (omit) through a knowing act of our will. \nFor more about sins of omission and commission see the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia . Mortal Sins and Venial Sins - Mortal and venial sins are Roman Catholic terms. Venial sins are trivial offenses against God's laws, whereas mortal sins are grievous offenses in which the punishment is spiritual, eternal death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:27:54.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
