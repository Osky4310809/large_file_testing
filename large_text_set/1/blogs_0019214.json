Turns out it’s true! Just ask Madonna. \nDuring the Women’s March in Washington D.C. on Saturday, the former singer told the crowd of 500,000 as well as everyone watching live television, that she contemplated blowing up the White House. \n“I’m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. But I know that this won’t change anything. We cannot fall into despair. As the poet W. H. Auden once wrote on the eve of World War II, ‘We must love one another or die.’ I choose love. Are you with me?”\nIf destroying houses with fire and explosions was a sign of love, then that would have made Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes a modern-day Aphrodite.\n\nBecause of Madonna’s perceived threat against President Donald J. Trump, the Secret Service will allegedly open an investigation on Madge, but that the decision to prosecute rests with the U.S. Attorney’s office .\nMadonna knows quite a bit about blowing things. In October, she promised that anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election would receive a blow job from her . In retrospect, one must wonder if that offer helped or hurt Hillary’s chances to win the election. \nSo be better than Madonna, and think twice before making a dumb assasination threat on the POTUS. \n[ DailyMail ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T05:55:35.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
