The meeting, which lasted about an hour, took place inside the President’s office shortly after Buhari and some government officials had observed the Jumat prayers in a mosque located inside the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Although the agenda of the meeting was not made public, it was suspected to have centred on the probe the AGF was directed to carry out on top government officials accused of corruption. The PUNCH had on Friday reported exclusively that the minister would meet Buhari and that the probe might form part of the discussion at the meeting. After the meeting, Malami, who usually uses the Service Chiefs’ Gate to access the President’s office, walked through the corridor in front of the Press Gallery. It was not clear whether he was headed for the Vice-President’s office or the office of the Chief of Staff to the President. Buhari, had on December 18, 2016, directed Malami to probe all top government officials accused of corruption. In announcing the presidential directive, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, had said any of the government officials found guilty of the allegations levelled against them would not escape prosecution. Based on that directive, the AGF had queried the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal; and the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, on the allegations levelled against them. They were reported to have since replied their queries. The Senate, had on December 14, 2016, called for the removal and prosecution of the SGF following alleged complicity in the diversion of the North-East humanitarian funds. This followed the presentation of the interim report of the Ad hoc Committee on Mounting Humanitarian Crisis in the North-East by the Chairman of the Committee, Shehu Sani. The call for Lawal’s removal followed alleged contravention of the provisions of the Public Procurement Act and the Federal Government’s Financial Rules and Regulations pertaining to the award of contracts.
