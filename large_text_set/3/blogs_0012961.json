Are you ready for the remake? (Photo: Warner Bros) \nAlthough the trailer isn't available online yet, dedicated horror website Bloody Disgusting has revealed what's to come with a report from the event. Read More Creepy clown craze sweeping the UK has been inspired by some of this TOP TEN killer clown movie list \n\"The trailer opens with footage of Bill Denbrough making a paper boat for his little brother Georgie. We then move outside, where Georgie is chasing his boat in a rainstorm as it floats next to the curb,\" the description details. \n\"Suddenly, Georgie runs right into a street barrier, which knocks him down on the ground. He then watches as his boat sails into a gutter.

As he looks deep into the sewers, Pennywise abruptly appears before the screen cuts to black.” \nThe Loser's Club is heavily featured as they look through pictures on a carousel slide project which takes on a life of his own. \n\"As the projector moves from slide to slide, the hair moves out of [Georgie's] mother's face, and her face is revealed to be that of Pennywise itself,\" it continues, before the trailer goes through a \"flurry of shots\". Tim Curry starred in the 1990 classic \n\"The most striking image from this succession of shots is the unforgettable moment when blood flows out of Beverly’s sink, only in Muschietti’s film it spews out like a geyser and blasts her in the face. \n\"There is also a sublime image of Pennywise approaching two of the children (he has them cornered against a wall), but the shot is framed in a way so that only his long, bony fingers fill the screen. The children are in the background, out of focus but clearly terrified.” Can the remake live up to the original? (Photo: Lorimar TV/WB TV/REX/Shutterstock) \nIn the final moments of the teaser, it's reported that Loser's Club leader Bill is seen walking into his flooded basement before Pennywise rushes at him - which left those watching screaming. \nStephen King's IT is set to hit the big screen in September 2017.
