Pepe is a truly disgusting frog which has been used as a symbol to spread hate online and harass journalists and those that disagree with the Alt Right(Reich) *sic . “Meme Magick” Most recently, these Nazis have attempted to use this symbol to “ meme Marine Le Pen into office ”, similar to the way the harnessed “Meme Magick” to elect Donald Trump in 2016. The Hacker Known as 4 chan Anyway, that was a quick rundown on the history of the Alt Right and their hateful propaganda. So, What About The Trash Doves? The Trash Doves have become a new symbol of hate for the Alt Reich Hitler worshipers. The Trash doves appeared as a “normie meme” near the end of January 2017, but by early February, the Alt Right had managed to take the bird back from the normies. A quick historical rundown from Know Your Meme : “About Trash Doves is a set of Facebook stickers featuring a large-eyed purple pigeon in various situations, the most notable of which is an animated sprite of the bird vigorously thrashing its head up and down. Shortly after its debut on Facebook in January 2016, the purple dove sticker set quickly became a viral subject of photoshopped parodies and image macros on the social media. Origin Florida artist and Adobe creative resident Syd Weller’s “Trash Doves” sticker set officially made its Facebook debut [1] [2] on January 31st, 2017, which included an animated emoji of a headbanging pigeon (shown below). “ As early as on February 7th, the sticker suddenly went viral in Thailand, beginning with a music video posted on the Facebook page สัตว์โลกอมตีน [4] (Animals With Paws), where it garnered more than 3.7 million views within five days.” Where the fun stops Anyway, that’s where the fun stops. On February 11th, the Hacker known as 4chan got his hands on the meme and teamed up with the forces of the Alt Right and they perverted this meme, turning it into a hate symbol: Their madness doesn’t end, I could post thousands of these from my time spent deep undercover in these hate groups. The Sticker War The Alt Righters teamed up on the early morning hours of February 13th and began to flock to liberal pages like CNN and post the Facebook stickers of these hateful birds. Some rumors say that they are trying to block free speech of those whom’st they don’t agree with by creating chaos and madness with “cute purple birds”, otherwise looking non suspicious to the average observer. But, as a dedicated undercover Meme War investigative journalist, I can tell you this; these birds are far from “cute”. They are a hate symbol and need to be recognized as such, immediately! They are flooding the comment section and not allowing ideas to be properly expressed. The Hateful Dove of Hitler appears in the CNN Facebook page comments on Febuary 13th, 2017. Deep Undercover Investigative Journalism My deep undercover investigative journalism has led me to a comment posted on a thread about Hitler on another thread about Kek taking the bog pill while Baneposting and praising Horus and Thoth on 4chan and the relevance to the hateful Hitler bird. “CNN has disabled all comments on their Facebook page. Occupy Democrats has disabled all image posting. The opening salvo of Meme War II has been a resounding success. Congratulations, goys and girls, we’re reaching unheard of levels of tactical memetic warfare. KEEP THE PRESSURE ON! edit: apparently CNN has their comments on again. It definitely was not working earlier today, though. Hard to say if they just fucked something up or did it purposely. edit 2, the Editening: Now getting reports that STICKERS are disabled on many CNN posts. I didn’t even know they could do that.” The “Editening”? more like the sickening, amirite? The Trump link Of course they had to “Make Trash Dove Great Again” too right? Their sickness knows no bounds. The Hero That Saved Free Speech What first alerted me to this awful bird of hate was this hero that shared this awesome post of awareness about the evil and wickedness of Trash Dove. Without this post by the true patriot and hero Tommy J Efferson, this article today would not be possible. Hitler Propaganda Poster With Dove Sic* The emphasis in these posters was not deep visual symbolism — this wouldn’t have been often picked up on by the masses. Instead, the posters contained short, pithy sayings, or oratorical prose. Goebbels and Hitler both claimed that propaganda was a great art, and to communicate effectively a united message to the masses was the goal. No deep thinking or heavy symbology would be as effective. Hitler wanted an unthinking mass of Germans, united in attitude, to avoid dissent and confusion. As he said in Mein Kampf , “All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level has to be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to.” The Frog God & The Bird God The Alt Right is known to have ties to the ancient Egyptian Gods. They are said to harness memetic abilities that can “shitpost” ancient Egyptian Gods into reality. It started with the worship of Pepe manifesting into the God known as Kek. Now we have Peck, but, Peck is simply the name of the messenger and not the messiah. Peck is the “Pepe” of the Bird God. We are not sure which Egyptian God the Alt Right is trying with Peck at this moment. Insider sources believe it may be Thoth or Horus . The story is still fresh and breaking, we will be watching these sickos and covering their madness with these Trash Doves of Hitler. Don’t Be This Guy/Girl: There are harmless versions of the meme and it has been spread to us normal folk too, I admit, I fell for the meme of the “cute birds” when they appeared. But, once I saw the post informing me about the true meaning and realized the Hitler worship that goes into this meme, I was sickened and had to go repent. Not Cool Seriously not cool!
