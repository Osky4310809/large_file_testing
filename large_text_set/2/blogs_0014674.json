Thank you for being my home @abbywambach . I love us.' Melton announced their relationship back in November 2016. Wambach is currently in the process of divorcing fellow soccer star Sarah Huffman. Melton announced her divorce from Craig Melton, her husband of 14 years, in August.

So today, I'm going to share with you my new love' Melton's book Love Warrior was featured in Oprah's Book Club. Melton, a mother-of-three, is known for writing about her struggling marriage, addiction and eating disorder, according to the Washington Post . She has also been a champion of LGBT rights, and insists that same-sex marriage is not contrary to the church. In November, Melton wrote on Facebook: 'Feels like the world could use all the love it can get right now. So today, I'm going to share with you my new love. 'Her name is Abby. You might recognize her from soccer.' She said her ex-husband Craig supports her relationship with Wambach and that they make a 'beautiful, modern family' together.

' Melton announced her divorce from Craig Melton (pictured with her and their children) her husband of 14 years, in August Wambach, who lost her sponsors after a DUI last April, is currently in the process of divorcing fellow soccer star Sarah Huffman (couple above in 2015) Melton has a coveted place on the Oprah Book Club list. She is pictured sitting down with Oprah Winfrey 'They're lucky kids, to be surrounded by so much love. We have family dinners together — all six of us — and Abby cooks. (She is an AMAZING chef because Jesus loves me). 'We go to the kids' school parties together. We are a modern, beautiful family. Our children are loved. So loved. And because of all of that love, they are brave.' Wambach (pictured in her mugshot after DUI arrest) Wambach was one of the inspirational guests of honor on Melton's book tour in September - and has also been blisteringly honest about her past. In her memoir Forward, released in September 2016, the retired US national team star recounts her career, revealed her struggle with alcohol and prescription drugs for years prior to her arrest for driving under the influence this past April. Chapters in the book are words that she has been labeled: tomboy, captain, lesbian, and addict. Wambach spends a good portion of the book detailing her bouts with vodka and pills, which included Vicodin, Ambien and Adderall. But she says she has been sober since the night she was pulled over in Portland, Oregon, after dinner with friends. Wambach said that night was a culmination of events as her life spiraled out of control. Her marriage was on the rocks, she was wrestling with her retirement and her direction, and she had just taken a new job with ESPN. She issued a statement on Facebook after she was released from jail the next morning, taking full responsibility for her actions and apologizing to her friends, family and fans. In the aftermath, the car company MINI USA withdrew her from its heavily promoted advertising campaign, which also starred tennis great Serena Williams.
