My mind is a bit blown. We have a big game Wednesday and injuries are screwing it up. \n\"A lot of the season is still left and like I always say, we will be needing every player.\" \nRamos sets new Liga goal record \nA club statement confirmed Modric had suffered an injury to his right abductor, while Marcelo has a grade II tear in his left hamstring. \nMadrid gave no indication of a possible recovery for timescale for either player, although they seem certain to miss the Copa del Rey quarter-final second leg at Celta on Wednesday, when Zidane's side will look to overturn a 2-1 deficit.
