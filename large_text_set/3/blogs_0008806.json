So starting in 2018, the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race in March here at Las Vegas Motor Speedway will be known as the Pennzoil 400 – and that will be through 2022, and I expect beyond that as well.” \nThe latest announcement also comes on the heels of one earlier in the week in which it was revealed that the Vegas track will begin hosting a second Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race next season. That second annual event will be held in the fall and will be part of NASCAR’s playoffs. \n“This is a tremendous day for us at Las Vegas Motor Speedway,” track president Chris Powell said. “In a week filled with big news-making events, none is bigger than this announcement today. Because to have a race sponsor of the motorsport-tradition that Pennzoil has, it means the world to us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:47:20.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
