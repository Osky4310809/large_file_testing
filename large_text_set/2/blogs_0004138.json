By: FE Online | Published: February 5, 2017 1:26 PM The speculations of Sasikala anointment as CM were on rise since past one month. \nA crucial AIADMK legislative meet is underway at Sasikala Natarajan’s Poes Ganden residence in Chennai. Reports say that Sasikala could be named as new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister after the meet. Chief Minister O Panneerselvam is also present at the meet. The speculations of Sasikala’s anointment as CM were on rise since past one month. In what can be seen as first step towards power shift in Tamil Nadu Government, three top officials appointed by ex-CM Jayalalithaa have been removed from Chief Minister’s office. Indian Express reported that three key faces, Sheela Balakrishnan, K N Venkataramanan, and A Ramalingam, are the other top officials removed from their respective posts. \nUnhappy with the Sasikala taking over as CM, Jayalalithaa’s niece Deepa Jayakumar said that it’s nothing less than a military coup. “I would never imagine of something bad as this happen to the people of Tamil Nadu,” she said comparing it to be as similar as a ‘military take-over’ and not a democratic decision at all. \nWhile former chief secretary Sheela Balakrishnan was asked to quit as adviser to the Tamil Nadu government, Jayalalithaa loyalists, including K N Venkataramanan and A Ramalingam, the Secretary I and IV in CMO, were also the other top bureaucrats sacked from their posts. \nWatch: 5 Lesser Known Facts About Sasikala Natarajan \nIndian Express sources said that while Ramalingam’s removal was expected, Venkataramanan, who had a good rapport with Sasikala as well, had never expected to be removed in the heat of new political changes happening at the top of AIADMK.
