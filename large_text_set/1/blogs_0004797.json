The club name wasn’t mentioned. If Lewy had decided to move to China, his salary would have been significantly higher than €40m, which means more than Carlos Tevez earns.” \nKucharski added: “It’s obvious: Lewy is not only younger but also a better player than Tevez. Robert is not for sale right now,” but I never say never. Life offers several solutions.” A photo posted by Robert Lewandowski (@_rl9) on Dec 13, 2016 at 6:34am PST \nROBBEN TO CONSIDER CHINA SWITCH \nBut Lewandowski’s teammate, Arjen Robben, says he will consider a move to the Chinese Super League or MLS at the end of the season. \nHowever, the Dutch winger hasn’t ruled out staying at the Allianz Arena for another campaign. \n“Everyone has to personally assess this,” said Robben. \n“You must never say that this is not an option. But also do not say that you want to go. \n“I am now at Bayern. Of course, I plan a little, I talk to my wife. I am now at the top level. You must see what comes next. \n“My family comes first, but the life experience, living elsewhere - in the USA, in China - might come. But maybe not. Maybe I’ll go back home [to the Netherlands]. I do not rule out anything.” media_camera Bayern Munich's Dutch midfielder Arjen Robben. \nPODOLOSKI TO MOVE TO CHINA \nHowever, former Bayern star Lukas Podolski is set to move to Chinese club Beijing Guoan, according to Galatasaray director Levent Nazifoglu. \nThe former Arsenal star has spent the last few years at the Turkish club, but now looks set for a move to China. \nNazifoglu told press in Antalya: “The transfer of Lukas Podolski to Beijing Guoan is in its final stage. The player is in favour of the move; it has to happen this week or it won’t.” \nHowever, Galatasary will reportedly only sell Podolski to the Chinese club on their own terms. media_camera Lukas Podolski. \nTWO PREMIER LEAGUE STRIKERS TO CHINA \nTroy Deeney and Wilfried Bony are the latest Premier League stars to be linked with moves to China, according to reports. \nWatford captain Deeney is reportedly unhappy at Vicarage Road and Hebei China Fortune are keeping tabs on him, according to The Mirror. \nThe Chinese club is prepared to pay up to £25 million for the striker. After scoring just four goals this season, there’s a chance Watford may want to let him leave. media_camera Watford's English striker Troy Deeney. \nManchester City’s 28-year-old Ivory coast striker Bony, has been offered a £210,000 a week tax free, according to The Star. \nBony, who is on loan at Stoke, reportedly has a clause in his deal that allows him to negotiate with Chinese Super League clubs in the January transfer window. \nBut Bony will reportedly stay at Stoke to make his mark, instead of moving to China and possibly linking up with Deeney at the same club. media_camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T03:24:08.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
