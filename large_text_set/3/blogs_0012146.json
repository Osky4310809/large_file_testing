The participants were told that the shocks ranged from 15 volts (slight shock) to 450 (danger-severe shock.) \nImportantly, the shocks weren’t real, and the screams the participants heard when they pressed the zap button were actually pre-recorded. That person on the receiving end of the “shocks” was actually in on the experiment, though the participants didn’t know that. \nWhenever the study participant refused to administer a shock, the person in charged ordered him to do so, first saying things like “please continue,” moving up to “the experiment requires you to continue,” all the way up to, “you have no choice but to continue.” \nThe results? Sixty-five percent of the 40 guys in the experiment were willing to zap another person with 450 volts of electricity. \nPsychologists first conducted the experiment in the post-World War II days, after former Nazis testified during their war crimes trials that they were “just following orders,” The Telegraph reports. \nSo if that experiment were repeated nowadays—after knowing what we do now about blind obedience—the results would be much different, right? \nNot so fast. Scientists just repeated a version of the experiment in Poland, using both men and women as the participants and as the “shock” receivers. These findings were even more, well, shocking. \nIn this new study, a full 90 percent of the 80 people in the experiment were willing to press the button giving the highest shock. There was a slight trend for participants to be less willing to deliver a shock to a woman, though the small sample size makes the researchers unable to draw firm conclusions on it, according to the press release . \nBottom line: We haven’t learned as much from history as we may have hoped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T00:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:33:59.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
