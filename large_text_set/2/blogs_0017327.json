This dazzling diva recently went on a vacation to Dubai with her sister Rhea Kapoor and swamped our social media feeds with her incredible vacation pictures. The girl sure did have a lot of fun exploring the Dubai Shopping Festival and other high-end brands at the Dubai Mall. What's more, she even found time to do some typical touristy things like posing in front of the Burj Al Arab and visiting the flea market. Along with her sister, she even showed us her crazy side with a fun mannequin challenge video. \nFrom being the girl next door who enjoys spending time with her sister to being a talent powerhouse and speaking her mind in a male-oriented industry. There is little that Sonam can't achieve. Before she headed off to Dubai on a vacation with her sister Rhea, Sonam bagged her first ever Filmfare Best Actor award. A big achievement for this grounded star. Enjoying the best of both the worlds, Sonam is always up to experiment. Talking about her experimental attitude, we listed down some of her best roles that prove she isn't ready to get type cast. 1. Aishaa Anil Kapoor Films Company \nA role that got Sonam Kapoor her due credit as a style icon in the industry was playing the title role in Aisha. A home production, close to her heart, Sonam was at complete ease playing a rich style icon who loves to play cupid. A girl bestie gang made the movie even more relatable for all of us. We were totally hoping to join the elite friend circle of Aisha. 2. Zoya Haider Eros International \nSonam's portrayal of Zoya in the love story ‘Raanjhanaa' made a strong case about combating one-sided obsessive lovers. She played a level-headed university student who knew exactly what she wanted; be it in her love life or otherwise. Forced relationships were not something she accepted. Her strong feminist approach in this film made us all proud. 3. Dr. Mili Chakravarti Anil Kapoor Films Company \nHigh on energy and colours, Sonam played the beautiful Dr. Mili Chakravarti in the royal drama ‘Khoobsurat'. She proved that she can be funky and full of zest, if that's what the role demands. Her portrayal of a doctor stuck in a royal affair made us pine for our prince charming. 4. Dolly Arbaaz Khan Productions \nRunaway bride Dolly plotted a perfect trap to con unsuspecting men who wanted to marry her in the comedy drama ‘Dolly Ki Doli'. Her versatility as an actor was showcased as she portrayed an array of characters that conned men into falling in love with her before she runs away with all their money. 5. Neerja Bhanot Fox Star Studios \nNo one thought that Sonam would take up such a daring and strong character to play but she did and surprised many with her versatile acting as the notable flight attendant on board the hijacked Pan Am Flight 73. From accolades within the industry to recognition at different award functions, Sonam has found herself a new tag in the industry. \nDespite her good work in the film industry, Sonam Kapoor is not one to boast. She lets her work speak for herself. This underrated star is more often happy just enjoying the perks of being an actor. Sonam recently headed off to the Filmfare awards ceremony to receive her award for Neerja before making a dash for the airport to head off to Dubai for the Dubai Shopping Festival with her sister Rhea. The duo celebrated her victory with panache as they went on a luxurious shopping spree at the Dubai Mall and that's not all, they did everything touristy to enjoy their trip as true travellers. Who said a girl can't all the fun? She sure can!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:10:10.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
