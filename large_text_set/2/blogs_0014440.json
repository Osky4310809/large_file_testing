The unmanned craft, which is one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets, is en route to the International Space Station for a resupply mission. 2 \nTen minutes after liftoff, part of the Dragon broke away and flew back to earth before landing on the launch pad. 3 \nThe craft is hauling approximately 5,500 pounds of research equipment, cargo, and supplies. 4 \nThe equipment includes a crystal that is unable to grow to its full potential on earth due to gravity. In space, the crystal will grow to a size that allows scientists to examine how the molecules are arranged, providing new information on how they work in the body. \nThere is also a 2,200 pound instrument onboard that measures the levels of ozone, aerosols, nitrogen dioxide and water vapor in the stratosphere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T20:39:10.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
