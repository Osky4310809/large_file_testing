However the problem is knowing when is the \"right time\" to actually make it happen. This person is obviously important to you and you don't want to mess up things by rushing into it and freaking him or her out. However if you do feel that this is the next big step, here are a few factors that will give you the green flag to go ahead with the meeting. Sure, it's going to be awkward at first, but that doesn't meet it shouldn't happen. 1. You both are super secure about this relationship \nYou've had the big talk and both of you are on the same page regarding where this relationship is heading. You trust this person completely and you do feel the most secure, happy and confident when you are around him or her. 2. It's the next big step \nYou and your partner have been dating for quite some time now, and meeting their parents and vice versa seems to be the next big step. You want the families to meet and also get okay with the idea of the two of you being together. 3. You both are ready \nRemember this is not just about you and your parents. Your partner has to be as prepared as you are. Make sure you talk to your partner about their honest feelings and thoughts regarding this. You really don't want to rush this big meeting. 4. Your partner has met other members in your family \nIt is actually a great idea to make your partner meet either your sibling(s) or your cousin(s) before you go ahead with meting the parents. Get their opinion and perspective too and when you finally introduce them to your parents, let that person be there too to make things less awkward. 5. Your family is okay with the idea of meeting someone you love \nAre your parents well and truly on-board with the idea of you introducing someone new to them? If they are going to freak out and flip, you really don't want to put them in this situation. Talk to them about how important this person is for you, and how you do need them to get along.
