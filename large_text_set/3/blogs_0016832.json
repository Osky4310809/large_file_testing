We're told the volume was too high for a flight attendant, who told him to turn it down.\nRich refused and she immediately called cops to handle the situation. When the door opened, LAX officers walked on and took him off the plane. Rich shot some video while he was standing in the jetway and cops lectured him about having respect for fellow passengers. He was not arrested\nFor his part, Rich seems to think he was the victim of a \"rusty, dirty\" flight attendant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:04:57.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
