You won’t mistake any brightly colored Nerf weapon for a real gun, but mechanically they’re cousins at this point. We’ve seen magazine, drum, and belt-fed machine guns, bolt actions, bipods, tripods, and a variety of grips and stocks for Nerf guns, evoking countless pistols, submachine guns, and rifles. The Nerf N-Strike Elite and Modulus lines have done the bulk of this work, with the N-Strike rail system giving way to dozens of accessories and configurations for Modulus blasters. Now Nerf is going a step further, with its first selective fire blaster.\nThe Nerf Regulator is a carbine-style blaster that uses four C batteries to blast darts from its standard N-Strike magazine. We’ve seen plenty of those before, like the Nerf Hyperfire, Rapidstrike, and Stampede. The Regulator makes its own unique mark with a three-way selector switch in front of the trigger guard. It can fire full-auto (hold the trigger down and darts keep shooting out), semi-automatic (pull the trigger once to fire a dart), and burst-fire (pull the trigger once to fire three darts rapidly).\nThis is called selective fire, and it’s both a first for Nerf guns and a common feature on military rifles. The US military’s primary infantry weapon, the M16A4, is a selective fire rifle with semi-automatic and burst modes. Its replacement, the M4 (currently being phased in), is a selective fire rifle with semi-automatic and burst modes. They aren’t fully automatic, but full-auto actually isn’t that useful outside of suppressing an opposing force; tactically, short bursts are vastly preferred when you want to hit specific targets and not just keep a bunch of peoples’ heads down. Of course, firing Nerf guns fully automatic is just fun (so is firing regular guns full-auto , but a machine gun rental that lasts 10 seconds at most costs as much as outright buying a Nerf gun). Because they’re foam darts, and you don’t depend on them to keep you alive (and they aren’t nearly as accurate as any real firearm in the first place, regardless of the firing mode). That and the Regulator will retail for $59.99, while any automatic firearm will cost you several thousands of dollars, and a few hundred dollars past that for all of the necessary paperwork.\nHasbro isn’t stopping at selective fire with amusingly realistic Nerf gun characteristics. Besides the Nerf Modulus Regulator , Hasbro will be releasing the Nerf Modulus Day/Night Zoom Scope. This is another first for Nerf. While there have been plenty of scopes to put on your Nerf gun in the past, they’ve almost all been completely useless plastic tubes with flat plastic lenses that don’t help you aim better. The Day/Night Zoom Scope uses a digital zoom to let you see your target five times closer than you would otherwise be able to. It still isn’t an optical zoom, but it’s still a big plus.\nAn even bigger plus is its night vision. Yes, this is a night vision scope for your Nerf gun. Toy night vision scopes are nothing new, and they’re both surprisingly effective and really fun (when they use a digital camera and infrared LEDs and aren’t just lenses tinted green with lights strapped to their sides). This is the first we’ve seen that you can just slide onto an N-Strike accessory rail, though. It’s pricey technology, though; at $49.99, it’s one of the most expensive Modulus accessories you can buy .\nBoth of these advances in foam military technology will hit the consumer market this Fall. That’s the same time The Judge comes out, so it’ll be a banner season for absurd Nerf guns.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00U5UE146", "http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/SearchDisplay?categoryId=&storeId=10151&catalogId=10051&langId=-1&sType=SimpleSearch&resultCatEntryType=2&showResultsPage=true&searchSource=Q&pageView=&beginIndex=0&pageSize=18&searchTerm=modulus#facet:&productBeginIndex:0&orderBy:&pageView:grid&minPrice:&maxPrice:&pageSize:&"], "published": "2017-02-21T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:11:40.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
