Source: Supplied \nPacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum had given the world champ until today to make a decision because the Queensland Government and Brisbane City Council — who are financing the bout — would not wait indefinitely. \nPacquiao is expected to make more than $A10 million from the defence of his World Boxing Organization welterweight title against the undefeated Horn, who has put his work as a schoolteacher on hold to become the No. 2 contender for the Filipino senator’s belt. A post shared by Jeff Horn (@jeffhornboxer) on Feb 25, 2017 at 5:44pm PST \nArum and Horn’s promoters, Duco Events, had announced the Brisbane boxer would fight Pacquiao at Suncorp on April 23 but Koncz instead flew to Abu Dhabi chasing a huge purse for a bout with England’s Amir Khan that eventually fell through when the financial guarantee failed to materialise. \nPacquiao, 38, has a record of 59 wins in 67 fights. He hasn’t fought since last November when he regained the WBO title with a decision over American Jessie Vargas. \nHorn, 29, who is unbeaten in 17 fights, will start the world title bout a heavy underdog but takes heart from the fact that Pacquiao has lost three of his last eight fights and has not scored a stoppage since 2009. \n“I think I’m getting Manny at the right time,’’ Horn said. “He’s not as great as he was — he’s slipped a little bit and I’m on the rise.’’ View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
