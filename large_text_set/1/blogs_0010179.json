Outwardly, these Cybermen resembled the Cybermen of Cybus Industries , but their chest logo featured a simple circle instead of the Cybus logo. ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) They were known to use blasters on their wrists , were all linked by the Cyber-network , and used terms such as \"Delete\" and \"Upgrade\" like the Cybus Industries Cybermen ( PROSE : Plague of the Cybermen , GAME : The Eternity Clock , COMIC : Assimilation² ) as well as Cybermats and Cyber-Planners . ( TV : Closing Time , GAME : The Eternity Clock ) Their arsenal also consisted of large handheld weapons which were sometimes used in place of wrist blasters. ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War , GAME : The Eternity Clock ) History Edit \nA Cyber Ship full of these Cybermen, either on a mission for colonisation or a military purposes, crash landed in Klimtenburg at some point prior to the 19th century . The survivors began capturing humans, using body parts to replace their own damaged parts, and they created their own thunderstorms so they could revive themselves using power from the lightning. The Eleventh Doctor arrived in Klimtenburg during the 19th century and began to investigate an illness the villagers were catching which he identified as Hapthoid Radiation poisoning from a Cyber Ship's generator. As more and more Cybermen began to revive, the Doctor rallied the villagers to fend off the oncoming attack. When battle began, the Doctor infiltrated the Cybermen's base of operations and, with the help of the mostly converted Victor Ernhardt , overloaded the Cyber-network with excess power. All the Cybermen exploded. ( PROSE : Plague of the Cybermen ) A Cyberman under Sanderson & Grainger . ( TV : Closing Time ) \nIn 2011 , a group of these Cybermen were encountered by the Eleventh Doctor and Craig Owens in Colchester . They were based in another crashed ship which the Doctor claimed had been crashed in the future site of the Sanderson & Grainger department store, \"centuries\" before the survivors were revived by the council laying down cabled on top of it, which activated the ship's Cybermats . The Cybermen attempted to rebuild their numbers and upgraded store employees Shona and George but they were eventually defeated when Craig's love for his son Alfie allowed him to resist Cyber-conversion and created a surge of emotion which destroyed the Cybermen. ( TV : Closing Time ) The Ninth Cyber Legion 's Cyber-Planner . ( GAME : The Eternity Clock ) \nThe Ninth Cyber Legion invaded London in 2012 commanded by a Cyber-Leader and a Cyber-Planner using a piece of the Eternity Clock . They made a Cyber factory that was full of Cyberman storage units, guarded by Cybermats . The Legion was destroyed by the Eleventh Doctor and River Song by shutting down their thermionic core. The shells of dead Cybermen remained in London as far as 2106 when the Daleks of the New Dalek Paradigm invaded. ( GAME : The Eternity Clock ) \nIn a daring attempt at conquest, the Cybermen prepared an armada of Cyber Ships and attempted to take over other universes as well as their own. Led by a Cyber-Controller , the armada crossed from their universe into the 24th century of another and entered into an alliance with a species similar to their own known as the Borg and together they attacked the planet Delta IV . The Deltan Prime Minister escaped the attack and warned Starfleet of the newly assembled war force. The Doctor, Amy and Rory accidentally found themselves on the bridge of the USS Enterprise just as it was attacked by a massive fleet of Cyber Ships and Borg cubes . Joining forces with Captain Jean-Luc Picard , the Doctor intended to help Starfleet end the Cyber threat. He then began to remember an encounter with the original Cybermen during his fourth incarnation which took place in the same universe - which he also remembered not remembering - and concluded that the Cybermen were rewriting history. \nMeanwhile, the Cybermen betrayed the Borg and the two sides fought a devastating battle on Cogen V . The Cybermen were victorious and the Borg collective was at risk of falling completely under Cyber control. The Enterprise arrived at the planet to find only the remnants of numerous Borg ships in its orbit and the bodies of Cybermen and Borg on the planet's surface. The Borg contacted the Enterprise and offered Picard an alliance. Picard refused, having painful memories of a previous encounter with the Borg, but the Doctor, Amy and Guinan realised the alliance was necessary. Picard realised this too after the Doctor took him in the TARDIS and showed him a future in which the Cybermen had succeeded. The Borg accepted the temporary alliance and they and Starfleet organised a raid on the Cyber-Controller's command ship and they weakened the Cybermen by filling the air with gold dust. After a struggle with the Cyber-Controller, one of the Borg set all ships linked to the Cyber-web to self-destruct, much to the Doctor's disgust as he considered this genocide , despite what the Cybermen had done. With the complete destruction of the Cybermen from the Federation universe, the Doctor guessed that any changes they had made had unwound themselves, although all involved would retain their memories of the event. ( COMIC : Assimilation² ) \nIn the 52nd century , the Twelfth Cyber Legion was positioned 20,000 light years away from Demons Run when it was largely obliterated by the Eleventh Doctor and Rory Williams , who were planning to assault the asteroid station to rescue Amy and Melody Pond . This gave the Cyber-Leader little choice but to give the Doctor and Rory the information they needed regarding Demons Run. ( TV : A Good Man Goes to War ) \nThe dead suit of one of these Cybermen was recovered after the Cyber-Wars and used as a chess -playing robot at Hedgewick's World of Wonders , where it was referred to as one of the 699 Wonders of the Universe . Some Cybermites waited inside the suit for a chance to wake three million other Cybermen, left over from the Cyber-Wars, from their tombs . The Cyber-suit was destroyed when Emperor Ludens Nimrod Kendrick Cord Longstaff XLI set off a bomb to kill the Cybermen emerging from hibernation, destroying the planet as well. ( TV : Nightmare in Silver ) Alternative timeline Edit \nIn the future shown to Picard by the Doctor in which the Cybermen had succeeded in their conquest of multiple universes, the Cybermen made use of the technology they had acquired from the Borg and they were able to convert more species. Among these species were as follows: The Klingon homeworld of Qo'noS fell to the Cybermen in under 50 years. These Cybermen bore the Klingon insignia and used Klingon swords . Raxacoricofallapatorius was taken 30 years after Qo'nos. The Raxacoricofallapatorians were more bulbous Cybermen with large claws for hands. The Vulcan homeworld was taken another 20 years later and all the Vulcan culture and wisdom was lost. The Judoon were conquered in another 25 years and they became the Cybermen's shock troopers, identified by their metal Rhinoceros horns. Humanity fought back for almost 40 more years but the Cybermen eventually triumphed. San Francisco became another nexus from which the Cybermen could strike. Starfleet Academy held the last survivors in the galaxy before they were overrun.
