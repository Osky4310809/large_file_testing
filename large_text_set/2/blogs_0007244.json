However, we probably wouldn’t have known if Nikki Reed didn’t take to Instagram to address the rumors. \nIn a new Instagram post, which features a photo of Somerhalder, Dobrev and Reed, Nikki says, \nHere’s to putting an end to all those fake stories of on-set jealousy, betrayal, made-up-friendships lost and women hating women. Because at the end of the day, that’s what this is about: teaching girls that you have to hate other girls only. \nReed went on to talk about certain websites that helped stir up drama where there was none. Giphy \nThe actress continued, \nLet’s use this as an example of how important it is to stop this trend of writing horrible headlines about women, painting us as bitter, angry, insecure, heartbroken, childless, feuding, backstabbing monsters because whether we want to admit it or not, it changes the way all women view themselves. And shame on these websites for now targeting an even younger demographic, instilling this at an earlier age when girls are even more susceptible, more vulnerable and more malleable. \nTake that, haters. Here’s Nikki Reed’s full post addressing the rumors about a possible feud between herself and Nina Dobrev over Ian Somerhalder. Ian took to Instagram to post the same photo with a message of his own. Finally, Nina Dobrev offered her take on the subject. \nAnd THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is how you address untrue rumors and gossip. Take notes!
