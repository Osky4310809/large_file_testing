A defeat will never authorise the spreading of the most malevolent rumours. \n\"Shame to those - often L'Equipe - who disseminate them without even knowing their information. No credibility.\" Matuidi is booked early on during the defeat (Photo: REUTERS) Verratti sits alone after the defeat (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nPSG players were angrily confronted at the airport upon returning to Bourget Airport in the early hours of Thursday. \nThe club said players were insulted and that some had their cars vandalised, amid angry confrontations that created what was described as an \"extremely hostile and aggressive climate\".
