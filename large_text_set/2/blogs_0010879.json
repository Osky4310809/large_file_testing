For older Americans, recovering lost ground has been a challenge. Households headed by someone 65 or older saw the biggest hit to their net worth, in terms of lost money. U.S. Census Bureau data showed they suffered a median decrease of $25,762 to $170,128 in 2010 from $195,890 in 2005. \nThe subsequent years have been a struggle. Older Americans have less income and less time to work on rebuilding what they do have. Keeping their nest egg shielded from risk also limits its growth potential. It also opens the door to an entirely different risk – that of running out of money later on. Issues like asset allocation and risk postures are as relevant today as they were in the halcyon days before the bust. Seniors – especially retirees, who are at the conserving-vs.-accumulating stage of life – need to figure out how to balance their positions so they can experience a comfortable retirement. \n“I believe many retirees make a very big mistake in retirement. They become too conservative. Life expectancies are getting longer and retirement age isn't getting older. This means your nest egg must last longer,” says Michael Kostelnik , president, Family Life Financial Planning, LLC , in Cleveland, Ohio. \nHere are some considerations that can guide retirees' thinking. Asset Allocation Should Be a Fluid Endeavor \nIt’s true that asset allocation is guided by age and life cycle; however, asset allocation is not dependent on an individual's age. Demographics and longevity suggest that seniors can take more investment risk than their parents did and can do it comparatively comfortably. Assets have expanded beyond equities into more commodities, currencies and real estate, and types of debt (corporate, municipal and mortgage). To that end, asset allocations can be more diverse than might have been the case in the past. \n“The better the allocation, the better positioned the investor is to defend against volatility that occurs in the market price of securities among asset classes, countries, sectors, industries and, of course, individual companies. The better market risks are managed, the more likely it is that the investor remains a long-term investor and will not pull the plug at the wrong time,” says Stephen J. Taddie , managing partner, Stellar Capital Management, LLC in Phoenix, Ariz. \nRetirees need to ensure they can pay their fixed costs and allocate accordingly if their investment portfolio is supplementing those costs. They are best advised to play it safe with the lion’s share of their assets and to adopt a trading mentality for a small amount. Their advisors will be instrumental in making sure their portfolios are invested and managed for risk, within the limits of the expectations the seniors have articulated. \n“Many retirees may want to have a higher percentage of their asset allocation in bonds and cash. That is their call. But the other portion of the portfolio needs to be diversified…because inflation will rear its ugly head again,” says Craig L. Israelsen, Ph.D. , designer and owner of 7Twelve Portfolio , based in Springville, Utah. Establish Steady Streams of Income \nRetirees should look toward ensuring they have several streams of income. The logical starters are Social Security, 401(k)s and other retirement savings accounts. Among the options for augmenting that income stream are real estate and annuities. \nInvestment home sales reached an estimated 1.09 million properties in 2015, according to the National Association of Realtors: It’s not just retirees who benefit by the reliable stream of cash flow that good tenants can generate each month. Especially given the erosion of home ownership since the recession, demand for rentals continues to grow, particularly in such population growth areas as Raleigh, N.C., Denver, Colo., and Austin, Houston, and Dallas, Texas. Of course, due diligence is always key, with an eye to properties in areas with desirable characteristics. \n“One option is to just find an agent and buy real estate, pure and simple,” says Jeff Tilson , investment advisor and fiduciary at JST Investment Consulting, Inc ., in Seal Beach, Calif. “However, most retirees have large nest eggs in retirement accounts. How does one go about tapping into the cash without all the taxable distributions? For my clients, I use self-directed IRAs . These are specialized custodians that allow investors to use their IRAs, 401(k)s, Roth IRAs, SEP IRA, etc. to buy hard assets such as real estate, promissory notes, precious metals and tax liens, etc. Typically, we can generate two to three times the amount of income as a blue-chip stock yield.” \nAnnuities are known for providing retirees with certainty and security, but their payout rates are affected by interest rates, which are currently still very low. There are various types of annuities, so seniors are well advised to get input from their financial advisors. While it may pay to wait in today’s rate environment, the tradeoff is in payments that are made over a shorter period. They will, however, be larger, generating a higher stream of reliable cash flow that will be helpful to those who live into older age. The Yield-vs.-Return Conundrum \nThis is an ongoing point of contention for investment professionals and an issue that hinders retirees, too. \nMany retirees focus on yields for their retirement rationale, seeing dividends and interest added to the income stream as being fine because they have been earned. The flip side, however, is that income investments can decline in value. Retirees may still reap the yield from their investments, but at what cost if their principal has declined? Moreover, there are tax implications to be considered, as discussed further, below. \n“Dividends and interest payments are seductive to risk-averse investors who prefer to treat them as stable guarantees. In reality, those payments are attached to a principal market value that is often quite sensitive and can swing wildly. Unless you are fully committed to holding a bond to maturity, for example, you're taking on much more risk than you think in your pursuit of cash flow,” says Max Osbon , partner, Osbon Capital Management , Boston, Mass. \nWith total return investing , distributions are taken in the amount the retiree wants to spend – whether they come from growth or income. This keeps the principal growing over time and also reduces the risk of relying on interest rates to produce spendable income. \n“There is no such thing as a crystal ball that will guarantee financial success or a happily-ever-after retirement. But we believe that total return investing offers the best odds for achieving [a person's] retirement spending goals – more so than pursuing isolated tactics such as chasing dividends or high-yielding bonds without considering their portfolio-wide role,” says Mark Hebner , founder and president of Index Fund Advisors, Inc. , in Irvine, Calif., and author of “Index Funds: The 12-Step Recovery Program for Active Investors.” Then There’s the Tax Issue \nRetirees with various investment accounts will commonly take funds out of some of them to augment their retirement income, but this will affect their tax situation as some accounts have higher tax rates than others. \nFor example, withdrawals from such regular taxable accounts held for at least a year (such as mutual funds) were subject to the capital gains tax rate, which is a maximum of 20% for high income taxpayers (those in the 39.6% tax bracket) in 2016. Traditional IRA and 401(k) withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income – as much as 39.6% for 2016. These rates are likely to change when President Trump's new tax plan is introduced and passed by Congress. \nTo minimize the tax bite, retirees should make sure they are tapping the “right” accounts in the “right” amounts, focusing on those accounts that will be subject to the lower capital gains tax rate. That will also help preserve their income levels. The Bottom Line \nOlder investors are challenged to stay smart – or get smarter about their investments once they reach the stage of conserving, versus building, their assets. They’ll be best served when their investment portfolio continues to match their risk tolerance and provides sufficient potential for growth. Staying on top of issues like these with the guidance of trusted financial advisors will go a long way toward ensuring a comfortable old age. \n“One of the biggest factors that can undermine a portfolio is human psychology that runs counter to what is in the best interest of the senior,” says Kirk Chisholm , wealth manager at Innovative Advisory Group in Lexington, Mass. “For many investors, their biggest enemy in investing is themselves. A financial advisor can help with that problem.” Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:26:08.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
