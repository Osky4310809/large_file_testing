The actress told The Today Show and Late Night with Seth Meyers that she actually avoids female friendships so she doesn’t have to commit to being in a wedding party. Although we don’t necessarily condone not being friends with women for this reason (we run the world after all), we do understand being averse towards the matching dresses, manicures, and money that comes with being a bridesmaid.\nA post shared by Anna Kendrick (@annakendrick47) on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:46am PST \n“I’ve only been a bridesmaid once. I feel like I’ve made an effort to not have super close female friends because, at any given point in my life, I have a female friend who’s like ‘I’m on this email chain and it’s about nail polish and we’re all gonna go get manicures and get the same manicures,’ and I’m so terrified of that that I feel like I’m waiting until girls get married and then we can be really close friends,” Anna told The Today Show . Anna, who was on the show to support her new movie Table 19, which is about the misfit table at a wedding, said that she’d rather be the one who hangs out at the back table anyway. She also told Late Night with Seth Meyers that she tries to not get invited to weddings because she thinks weddings are like watching your friends put on a pageant and having to participate while wearing a fancy dress. And honestly, when she says it like that, we can’t disagree.\nNBC/Getty But sometimes you just gotta take one for the team, wear the matching dress, and pretend like you’re having fun!\nCan't stay away @latenightseth \nA post shared by Anna Kendrick (@annakendrick47) on Feb 20, 2017 at 3:41pm PST \nWe’ll see you on the dance floor, Anna.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:13:58.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
