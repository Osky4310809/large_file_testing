Cooper-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe NBA will announce the All-Star Game reserves on Thursday, as picked by the league’s coaches. USA TODAY Sports’ Sam Amick and Jeff Zillgitt give their selections and the reasons why. \nEastern Conference \nZillgitt \nBackcourt: Kyle Lowry, John Wall. Frontcourt: Kevin Love, Paul George, Paul Millsap. Wild cards: Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker. \nIn selecting All-Star reserves, NBA coaches have a difficult decision. An All-Star-caliber player will be left off the team, and it’s not so much a snub as it is an imperfect process. The league is filled with great players, and there are only 12 spots per conference. This is my plea to the league moving forward: There are 13 active players on an NBA roster each game. Adding another All-Star to each conference won’t resolve every issue, especially in this year’s Western Conference where multiple deserving players will be omitted, but it will ease the difficulty. \nIn the East, the toughest decision was whether to put rookie Joel Embiid on the team. The top guards in the East have been great, and leaving Wall, Lowry, Thomas or Walker off the team would be more egregious than leaving off Embiid. It came down to minutes played and my appreciation for what those guards have done for their teams. \nAmick \nBackcourt: Lowry, Thomas. Frontcourt: George, Millsap, Love. Wild cards: Wall, Walker. \nEmbiid nearly earned himself a spot, but it’s just too tough to justify giving an All-Star spot to someone who has spent half as much time working as his contemporaries. No matter how dominant Embiid has been, and even with the clear correlation between his play and the Philadelphia 76ers morphing into a decent team, we’re still projecting his potential impact at this point. \nWalker, whom I saw as the final selection among the wild cards, has led the Charlotte Hornets for 1,485 minutes and is averaging 23 points, 5.4 assists and 1.2 steals per game. Millsap, whom I came close to excluding in exchange for Embiid, leads the Atlanta Hawks, who are fourth in the East, in minutes (1,427) and has a tremendous two-way impact when he plays, with a swing of 12.8 in net rating when he’s on the floor compared to when he’s off (+4.6 compared to -8.2).
