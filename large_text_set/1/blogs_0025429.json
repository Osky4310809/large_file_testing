Institutions across the region, from Santa Barbara to Palm Springs, are participating, offering visitors the change to scope out a wide range of art and historical artifacts from pop art by Roy Lichtenstein to exhibits documenting the fight for civil rights.\nGenerally, museums participating in the Free-for-All event are offering free general admission, which doesn't always apply to specially-ticketed exhibits. Some museums, such as the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades and  Exposition Park 's Natural History Museum, are offering free, timed-entry tickets; others, including the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo and the Autry Museum in Griffith Park, are opening their doors in a free-for-all.\nMuseum entry might be free, but usual parking fees still apply. For those taking the bus, rail, or subway: Metro has teamed up with several institutions to offer discounts at museum stores and other perks for riders who present their TAP cards.\nSoCal Museums Free-For-All [Official site] For science, art and history: Go Metro to Museums Free-For-All this Sunday [Metro] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:03:03.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
