No, it won't change anything. Yes, it's a bit childish. But at the same time it expresses pretty clearly how a lot of people feel about the new President. \nThe colourful march organised by Scotland Against Trump travelled from the Meadows before passing the Royal Mile and continuing over the North Bridge, reported the Daily Record .

People weren't afraid to say how they really feel (Photo: Splash News) \nScotland Against Trump said it was time to fight back against Trump's policies. \nIn a statement it said: \"Trump is the apex of an insurgency of an international far-right. \n\"We will resist. We are the majority. We are ready to make our voice heard.\" \nA police spokesman said: \"Police Scotland supported the safe facilitation of the demonstration in Edinburgh on Saturday, February 11, which passed peacefully and without incident. \n\"Officers would also like to thank the public for their patience and cooperation during this time.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:10:19.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
