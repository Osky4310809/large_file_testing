The currently nameless V-10–powered, mid-engined supercar is the first release from Italdesign Automobili Speciali, the famed design firm’s recently announced ultra-limited-edition division. \n-Co-founded by Giorgietto Giugiaro, who designed classics such as the Maserati Ghibli and the BMW M1, the Italian companh is now part of the Audi Group. The new specialty division intends to build limited-run cars (of fewer than 100 units) both under its own name and as a supplier to other automakers.\n-The vehicle seen here is the first example. It uses a modular chassis made of carbon fiber and aluminum, and the body is entirely carbon fiber to save weight. Under the hood is a 5.2-liter V-10 that Italdesign claims can shoot the car from zero to 62 mph in 3.2 seconds and on to at least 205 mph. It measures 190.8 inches long, just ahead of the 188.9-inch 2017 Lamborghini Aventador S , but it is 2.3 inches narrower, at 77.6 inches, and 2.7 inches taller, at 47.4 inches, than the Aventador S.\n- \n-Although Italdesign did not say so, it’s likely that this machine is loosely based on the Lamborghini Huracán and Audi R8 siblings. Italdesign did acknowledge that it has access to the carbon-and-aluminum chassis and 5.2-liter V-10 engines found in both the R8 and the Huracán.\n- - Saved by Zero? Italdesign Unveils GTZero Concept - Italdesign Giugiaro Rolls Out the (Virtual) Red Carpet with Handsome, Autonomous GEA Concept - Italdesign Giugiaro Parcour Concept: Prototype Drive - -The company says the exterior design is faithful to the traditional idea of an Italian gran turismo car while also prioritizing aerodynamic proficiency. That explains why it has fins, scoops, wings, vents, flicks, splitters, diffusers, and just about every other aero element stuck to its body.\n- \n-Italdesign Automobili Speciali’s car number one will make its public debut at Geneva in March. The price is $1.6 million. If buyers choose, the car can be further customized with finishing and performance packages at additional cost. Italdesign Automobili Speciali is also debuting its logo at the show, which it said was inspired by the symbol of the city of Turin, the company’s Italian headquarters.\n- \n- ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:29:31.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
