After a good win you can be relaxed, and I try to avoid this. Sometimes it is good to increase the tension before a game, during a training session. That is part of improving the winning mentality.” \nIn a roundabout way, Conte was underlining the dangers of ­complacency.

If we are too relaxed we will lose.” \nNot that Chelsea will be complacement against Burnley – the Clarets, tipped for relegation, have won nine of their 13 games at home this season with Liverpool and Everton among their victims.

She said, ‘Why?
