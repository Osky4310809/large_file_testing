The second phase would stretch 151 miles connecting the Rio Grande Valley with Laredo, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, El Paso, Texas; and Big Bend, Texas. \nThe final and largest phase would secure the remaining 1,080 miles of the open border , although the exact locations were not specified. \nWhile neither DHS or the White House were prepared to give formal statements regarding the report, Trump told a group of law enforcement officials on Wednesday that “the wall is getting designed right now.”   \nAlthough critics have slammed Trump’s proposal due to the cost being much higher than he or his colleagues originally estimated, the fact that the DHS has conducted a detailed analysis of the project means that construction is right around the corner. The faster we can put up the wall, the faster we will start seeing the quantifiable — and even unquantifiable — benefits. \nIn addition, the DHS report also accounted for the cost of acquiring private land, which likely was not considered when Trump initially proposed the idea. \nBernstein Research, an investment research group that tracks material costs, determined the cost could be driven up to $25 billion due to uncertainties surrounding the endeavor, according to TheBlaze , such as eminent domain issues, but regardless of the details, there’s no denying Trump has a construction history of completing projects under budget. \nLike and share this article on Facebook and Twitter and tell us what you think about the estimated cost of Trump’s border wall.
