The organization’s California and Washington centers donate fetal tissue to researchers, the organization said. It has received money in reimbursement costs for transport and storage, but has since stopped accepting these funds. \nThe heavily edited videos proved damaging to Planned Parenthood, which received an increase in threats and harassment as a result. The videos further encouraged Republicans to call for Planned Parenthood to be defunded. \nA number of congressional committees launched investigations into the charges made in the videos, but no wrongdoing was found. Planned Parenthood also sent analysis to Congress, detailing how the videos had been manipulated. \n“The right to privacy is a cornerstone of California’s Constitution, and a right that is foundational in a free democratic society,” State Attorney General Xavier Becerra said . “We will not tolerate the criminal recording of confidential conversations.” CA Attorney General filing criminal charges sends a clear message — you can’t target women & health care providers without consequences. https://t.co/dFT42uZUyq \n— Planned Parenthood (@PPact) March 29, 2017 \nThe Center for Medical Progress released a statement calling the charges “fake news” and “bogus,” claiming they were designed to benefit Planned Parenthood’s “political cronies.” \n“We look forward to showing the entire world what is on our yet-unreleased video tapes of Planned Parenthood’s criminal baby body parts enterprise, in vindication of the First Amendment rights of all,” it said. \nPlanned Parenthood released a statement. “As we have said from the beginning, and as more than a dozen different state investigations have made clear: Planned Parenthood has done nothing wrong, and the only people who broke the law are those behind the fraudulent tapes,” Vice President of Communications Mary Alice Carter said . \nREAD MORE: Kansas senator compares Planned Parenthood to Nazi concentration camp \n“The California Attorney General filing criminal charges sends a clear message that you cannot target women and you cannot target health care providers without consequences. We look forward to justice being served.” \nDaleiden and Merrit were indicted in Texas last January. A grand jury had been convened to investigate Planned Parenthood and, after finding no wrongdoing, it indicted the two instead on criminal charges over their use of false identities. \nThose charges were dropped after a judge found the grand jury had exceeded its authority. \nVia RT .
