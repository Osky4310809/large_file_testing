It was important to us to use photography that represented their true beauty, without filters. \nIn 2014, Target landed in a lot of hot water after a model’s “thigh gap” was photoshopped to look more alien than human. Like, not even good photoshopping — it looks like someone took the eraser tool and said, \nWomen don’t need legs — if they only have thin, spindly, not human legs, then they’ll never run away from me… Making the news today, this pic formerly from Target's web site, where unrealistic body image meets bad Photoshop pic.twitter.com/uhj85SlbIu \n— tff-related name (@shyhoof) March 17, 2014 \nJust look at that gap. Yikes. \nAlso, I’m just noticing this now… Look at her armpit on the right side? That’s… not normal. \nBut people are loving the fact Target is finally embracing different body types. shoutout to target for not using photoshop in their latest swimwear campaign!!! pic.twitter.com/2wkxVPebia \n— gab (@gabby_frost) March 20, 2017 \nIt’s important to show people are beautiful just the way that they are and ridiculous standards that Photoshop perpetrates can be dangerous for people of every gender and age. Shout out to @Target for showing the beauty of curvy women and not photo shop every imperfection pic.twitter.com/juVjdyynXW \n— ✨ (@SheyenneRamirez) March 11, 2017 \nOne fan wrote on Crawford’s photo, \nJust wanted to say you are such an inspiration to me! Love how you shine with body positivity. It sets such a great example for other women like myself. I can’t wait to shop for some one pieces at Target soon! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
