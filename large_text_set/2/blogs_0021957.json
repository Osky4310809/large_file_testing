We showed our big heart, big organisation and belief, we never gave up and I'm very satisfied. \nWho's the boss?! Allegri proved right over Bonucci \n\"At the end, if we are a little more calm we can do something more on the counter-attack but it was very important for the match at home and everything is open. \n\"We suffered but we are ready to do battle. For us it is important to continue to show our performance, to show our football. \n\"They can score in every moment, but now we know what we have and we can play better maybe.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:02:18.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
