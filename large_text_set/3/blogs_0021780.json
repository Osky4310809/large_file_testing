Anything good on TV? 😂 #TeamTomi \n— Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 20, 2017 \n\nA staunch Donald Trump supporter, Lahren clarified her abortion comments after her appearance on “The View,” telling one outlet: “Listen, I am not glorifying abortion. I don’t personally advocate for it. I just don’t think it’s the government’s place to dictate.”\nShe also tweeted, “I speak my truth. If you don’t like it, tough. I will always be honest and stand in my truth.”\nThat appeared to draw a reaction from one of her co-workers, Blaze reporter Kate Scanlon who, captioning a Bible verse, tweeted, “There is no ‘my truth.’ There is only the truth.”\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:34:43.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
