Despite Democratic majorities in both state legislative chambers, the bill nonetheless died in committee last Thursday when Democratic state Reps. Debbie Rodella and Daymon Ely sided with Republicans to block it . \nRegistration has long been a barrier to participation in the electoral process. This automatic voter registration bill isn’t perfect, but it would go a long way toward expanding the electorate . When Republican legislators in state after state propose bills that make it harder to vote , Democrats can’t afford to sit idly by and not fight to ensure that citizens can exercise their most fundamental political right with ease. \nThis Democratic bill always faced the possibility of a veto threat from Republican Gov. Susana Martinez. However, she is term-limited in 2018, and Democrats have a strong chance to regain the governor’s office next year, giving them unified control over state government. \nExpanding voting rights should be one of the first things on the Democratic agenda when Republicans can’t stand in the way, but it’s simply impossible when members of our own party won’t even hold together. Democratic legislators who won’t support strengthening voting rights need to hear from their constituents. If they don’t change their minds, they must be held accountable.

Ely claimed in a Facebook post on Monday that he supports automatic voter registration, but thought that the current proposal was flawed and voted against it so that he could bring up a revised bill at a later date. However, Rep. Rodella sounds far more skeptical of the policy in general, and her vote would be necessary for passage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:51:29.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
