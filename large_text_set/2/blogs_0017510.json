Judicial symbol \nHe said they also found a red box which he could not precisely remember what was inside, adding that they also found two way bills of furniture supplied to the building. \nWhen the prosecution sought to tender the search warrant, the red box and the way bill as evidence, the move was objected to by the defence team. \nMr Lasun Sanusi (SAN), counsel for the defendant objected to the admissibility of the items, saying they were purportedly obtained from an illegal search. \nSanusi cited Section 115 of Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, which states that the occupant of a place searched or a relation shall be at the house and see the items seized. \nHe said no provisions of law permitted state security agents to conduct search by looking for strangers on the street to witness it. \nSanusi said the law gave the owner of the property the impetus to nominate a representative to witness such search if he or she could not be present. \n“My Lord, the witness had earlier confirmed that when they were to conduct search on the defendant’s house at Asokoro, they took him along to witness the search, why was this other one different. \n“It is on record that the defendant was still in detention when the purported search was done in his house at Maitama which is a clear violation of the law. \n“My Lord, we are not against the court admitting the search warrant as evidence but we vehemently oppose to the admissibility of the other items,’’ he said. \nOn his part, the Prosecution Counsel, Mr Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), argued that Section 149 and 150 of ACJA which deals with house search warrant permitted the presence of two witnesses. \n“This permission covers the person to whom the warrant is addressed and a neighbour within the neighbourhood the property is located,’’ he said. \nAccording to him, the provision allows the person to whom warrant is addressed to look for a witness in the neighbourhood. \nHe, therefore, argued that no provision of the law compelled the property owner to be present before a search warrant can be executed. \nJustice Okon Abang, however, adjourned the matter till Feb. 22 for continuation.
