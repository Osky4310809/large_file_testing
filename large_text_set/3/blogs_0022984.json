He said the reduction in the number of airlines, both domestic and foreign, operating in Nigeria has led to fewer ticket sales and affected the profit margins of travel agents. \nThe NANTA President who enumerated some of the problems affecting airlines to include the inability of foreign airlines to repatriate ticket sales proceeds due to unstable and scarce Foreign Exchange, said this major problem has led to partial withdrawal of some airlines from Nigeria. He also said “ the restriction of some inventories by some airlines like SOTO/SOTI tickets” and the closure of the Abuja Airport , a major hub, are some of the problems the airlines are grappling with. \nThese challenges according to him, have “ brought hard and unfriendly business atmosphere to our teeming members, and this scenario presents a huge burden to the association.” \nAccording to him, “We call on our members to remain strong, resolute and also endeavour to take advantage of every available opportunity in tourism to chart a new course. At our end, this council and the BOT of NANTA will strive to sustain the advocacy to occupy the Nigerian travel and tourism space like it has never been done before.” \nBernard said “That our nation is in recession today is not the issue but finding a true solution to the various challenges this economic meltdown present to us.”He also said that the 41st AGM had provided members opportunity to discuss the issues and proffer solutions to some if not all the challenges NANTA members are facing.
