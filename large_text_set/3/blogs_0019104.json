Saban Brands; Jacob Shamsian/INSIDER\n\"Power Rangers\" has been on television for a quarter of a century. But at the beginning, it was far from an assured hit. Haim Saban spent eight years shopping the idea around about a group of teens who get superpowers from a mighty wizard to battle monsters from outer space.\nThe show eventually premiered in August 1993 and became a sensation. Between advertisements and toys , \"Power Rangers\" made more than $1 billion per year in the 1990s.\nThe show recycles some footage from a similar Japanese show called \"Super Sentai.\" One of the hallmarks of \"Sentai\" is that each season — with a few exceptions — has new characters, new stories, and new costumes . That tradition has carried over to the rangers.\nThe costumes have become somewhat iconic. With their shiny spandex, bold colors, and thematic designs, they represent an earnest dedication to what are, by all means, absurd and incomprehensible storylines. With the new big-screen \"Power Rangers\" movie coming out , it's time to take a look at how \"Power Rangers\" fashion has evolved over the years.\nView As: One Page Slides The costumes in \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" (1993–1996) are the most recognizable. Saban The colors are bold and bright, accented in white with diamond patterns everywhere. And the helmets look like a cross between futuristic motorcycle helmets and gigantic insect heads.\nThey were tweaked a little in \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie\" (1995). Saban Brands The cast also changed a little for the show's first movie, and the costumes look more rubbery.\n\"Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers\" (1996) went more minimalist. Saban Brands In the next installment of the story, Zordon — the wise intergalactic sage who taught the Power Rangers the secrets of being Power Rangers — recruited a few alien rangers to help beat the bad guys. Their costumes are more minimalist and uniform. The patterns are simply stripes, and the costumes are mostly a solid color with a gold belt.\n\"Power Rangers Zeo\" (1996) was the first season to introduce totally new costumes. Saban Brands The show continued doing that for every season since. This one features a big gold neck piece as part of the suit and sometimes baffling shapes where the eyes should be on the helmets.\n\"Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie\" (1997) involved cars. Saban Brands The new suits are vehicle-inspired, with grill-like visors and trapezoidal icons.\nThe rangers looked like astronauts in \"Power Rangers in Space\" (1998). Saban Brands The helmets were rounded out, like astronaut helmets, and a strip of squares was added as a sort of breastplate. The Pink and Yellow rangers get a useless skirt added to their costumes, which continued on into some subsequent seasons.\nAside from monsters and fashion, \"Power Rangers in Space\" is notable for actually pulling all the plot strands from previous seasons together and wrapping up character arcs.\n\"Power Rangers in Space\" also featured the Psycho Rangers , a sort of evil mirror version of the Power Rangers.\nThey went back to the basics for \"Power Rangers Lost Galaxy\" (1999). Saban Brands The \"Lost Galaxy\" costumes look a lot like those in the original season, but with zig-zags instead of diamonds. The helmets also each correspond to an animal.\n\"Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue\" (2000) made them look more streamlined and futuristic. Saban Brands The visor part of the helmets cover the entire face, and a \"burst\" pattern over the torso replaces the zig-zags of yesteryear.\nEach ranger got a matching motorbike in \"Power Rangers Time Force\" (2001). Saban Brands It matches the shapes on their visors, which are colored instead of black.\n\"Power Rangers Wild Force\" (2002) gave them cool-looking animal helmets. Saban Brands For \"Wild Force,\" the rangers got gold sashes embedded across their chests and even cooler looking animal helmets. The blue ranger's shark helmet looks particularly badass.\nIt was only a matter of time before they got a ninja theme, with \"Power Rangers Ninja Storm\" (2003). Saban Brands The \"Ninja Storm\" cast broke the gender stereotyping of the previous seasons. It shattered a glass ceiling with its first female blue ranger (still, alas, relegated to being a supporting character instead of the team leader) and also had the show's first male yellow ranger. The costumes were themed after mostly wind and thunder.\nInstead of just normal animals, \"Power Rangers Dino Thunder\" (2004) used a dinosaur theme. Saban Brands With \"Dino Thunder,\" the gang got jagged diamonds that evoked dragon claws, and a footprint emblem on the chest.\n\"Power Rangers S.P.D.\" (2005) — or Space Patrol Delta — brought the rangers back to an intergalactic setting. Saban Brands The group protects the planet from the Troobian Empire's forces. The costumes make them look a bit like race car drivers, with giant numbers lined onto the torso.\nFor the first time, in \"Power Rangers Mystic Force\" (2006), the rangers got capes! Saban Brands The \"Mystic Force\" rangers have animalistic, usually winged silhouettes on the helmet faces.\nBecause \"Power Rangers Operation Overdrive\" (2007) was automobile themed, the costumes also had decorative grills. Saban Brands The \"Overdrive\" costumes reigned back into a simpler look, with a white stripe leading down the middle of most costumes, acting as negative space.\nThe costumes cycled back to animal themes in \"Power Rangers Jungle Fury\" (2008), with animal helmet again and matching markers on their bodies. Saban Brands The White Rhino Ranger has a kind of sash drawn where a belt would be, even though he's not wearing pants.\nIt wasn't always clear what \"Power Rangers RPM\" (2009) stood for. Saban Brands What exactly \"RPM\" stood for never actually appeared in the television show, according to the Power Rangers Wiki . But a website for a toy tie-in said the initials meant \"Racing Power Machines.\"\nIndeed, the costumes here are, once again, vehicle themed. Each outfit looks like it has a built-in harness, which somehow represented safety as the Rangers battled a dangerous computer virus.\nThe two \"Samurai\" seasons — \"Power Rangers Samurai\" and \"Super Samurai\" (2011–2012) — were the first since \"Mighty Morphin\" to use the same theme and costumes for multiple seasons. Saban Brands It also marked the return of the franchise to being produced by Haim Saban instead of Disney, which led to the new movie adaptation of the show.\nThe costumes have angel motifs in \"Power Rangers Megaforce\" (2013). Saban Brands In the Super Sentai Japanese counterpart to this season, the protagonists were based on 10,000-year-old inter-dimensional angels, so the costumes have angel motifs.\nThey all dress as pirates in \"Power Rangers Super Megaforce\" (2014). Saban Brands The \"Super Megaforce\" season continues the \"story\" of \"Megaforce,\" except now all the rangers have pirate outfits and cutlasses. The rangers could also morph into \"Super Mega Mode,\" which allowed them to call on the powers of all previous rangers.\n\"Power Rangers Dino Charge\" (2015) once again had animalistic costumes, this time with dinosaur themes. Saban Brands The zig-zags across the chest resemble sharp teeth and claws, and each one has sleeves that look like scales, even though many dinosaurs were covered in feathers . Each one has only a single shoulder pad, too.\n\"Power Rangers Dino Super Charge\" (2016) kept up the dino theme, but a notch higher. Saban Brands It also brought the total number of rangers up to ten members, the biggest team ever. Each ranger has bulkier, more dangerous-looking armor and a canister across their chests that looks like a battery.\nThe latest iteration of the rangers on television is \"Power Rangers Ninja Steel\" (2017). Saban Brands The visor for each ranger looks a bit like a ninja weapon, and the sash going across their chests looks like it's illustrated with a ninja star in motion.\nThe new big-screen \"Power Rangers\" (2017) movie has a production budget of more than $100 million, so it's no surprise that the costumes look a bit more expensive. Tim Palen/Lionsgate In the latest iteration , the rangers are teenagers who are given super powers and need to save the world from a giant golden monster named Goldar.\nThe costumes caused controversy for giving the female Power Rangers heels .\nRead the original article on INSIDER .
