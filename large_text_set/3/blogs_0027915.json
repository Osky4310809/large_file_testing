Well, they exist. Prepare to fall into a deep, deep pit of depression, my friends. Thanks to the Baby Spa in Perth, Australia, babies ages 2 days old to 6 months old can kick back and relax like kings and queens. On the menu are steam treatments, massages and facials starting at just $66 per appointment. Parents can stay and hang out with their kids, too. \nThe spa’s official website reads, \nBaby Spa Perth is a sanctuary for babies (newborn to six months) and their parents, offering unique hydrotherapy sessions, baby massage and support. \nThe hydrotherapy sessions are said to help increase with skeletal and muscular strength. Hydrotherapy is also said to help with a baby’s lung capacity as well as their digestive system. Ah, if I could go back in time before I even knew what an office chair was… Admit it: The jealousy is real right now! I’ve never wanted to be 2 days old again so bad before… Must be nice!

Research doesn’t show that it is or isn’t beneficial in normal kids so, as of now, I can’t recommend it. \nIn other words, the hydrotherapy and overall spa experience isn’t necessarily bad for a newborn baby, but there isn’t enough research out there yet to say it’s good for them, either. \nStill, he says what Baby Spa Perth offers is a great bonding experience for parents and their children. \nBRB, I’m going to hop in a time machine and go back a couple of decades!
