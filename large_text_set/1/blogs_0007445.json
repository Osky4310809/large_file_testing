He also said he was \"fed up with black people\" and would go to jail over the issue. According to the report, Ford said Crichton used the racial slur to Ford and her children after she asked for a refund for a mixed-up food order in the drive through. \n\"It was really just upsetting especially with having my children in the car,\" said Ford, the mother of a 2-year-old daughter and 5-month-old son. \"I mean, no one deserves to be treated like that.\" \nZion is about 50 miles north of downtown Chicago. \nThe incident prompted protesters to gather outside the Dairy Queen on Saturday. Ford said she has an attorney and is considering legal action. Ford's attorney didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. \nCrichton apologized in a statement provided by American Dairy Queen Corporation and said he would undergo sensitivity training. \n\"My actions were inexcusable and unacceptable,\" Crichton said. \"I can only ask for forgiveness and try to make it up to all involved.\" \nDairy Queen in a statement called Crichton's statements \"reprehensible\" and said his behavior doesn't represent the restaurant's values.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T08:33:38.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
