YouTube/Sarah_Lia \nMadonnaÂ gave an explosiveÂ address at the Women's March on Washington on Saturday that likely has manyÂ news networks wishing they had played her remarks on delay. \n\"Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House ... but I choose love,\" Madonna said from the main stageÂ area near the National Mall. \nHer remarks are now going viral. \nMadonna during her #WomensMarch speech: \"Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House\" pic.twitter.com/Z9ILmznAIw â BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) January 21, 2017 \nAn estimated 500,000 people poured into DCÂ over the weekend for whatÂ could be the largest political demonstration the US capital has ever seen.Â The march aims to bring together women across diverse backgrounds to send a bold message to the new administration that they will not be ignored or have their rights stomped on. It comes just one day after Trump's inaguration. \nMadonna, an icon of both pop music and feminism, took the stage later in the event. While theÂ march's organizers have insisted the event is pro-women more than anti-Trump, the singer did not pass on anÂ opportunity to take public digs at the new president. \n\"It took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the f--k up,\" Madonna said. \nShe repeated expletivesÂ multiple times on stage. \nđ RT @bubbaprog : Madonna has two words for the haters: pic.twitter.com/XRUdj2FluV â kase.
