Bradley later ended his testimony Thursday by testifying, “I’m not perjuring myself.”\nBradley first took the stand against his former friend on Monday , testifying for more than six hours, telling jurors Hernandez shot him in the face in Florida after Bradley referenced Hernandez’s role in the double murder in Boston on July 16, 2012.\nSEE ALSO \n'I plotted to kill Aaron Hernandez after he shot me in the eye' 0:0 An admitted drug dealer who bonded with former NFL star... While at a strip club in Florida, Bradley testified Hernandez began thinking there were undercover cops tailing him.\n“I said, ‘If they are, it’s because of the stupid [expletive] you did in Boston,’ ” Bradley testified, according to Yahoo! Sports . “He became standoffish. He became upset.”\nBradley testified he later fell asleep, only to awake with Hernandez pointing a gun in his face.\n“Right between my eyebrows,” Bradley testified.\nBut on Thursday, the text Bradley sent attorney Robert Pickering revealed Hernandez’s former buddy actually had no idea who really shot him.\n“Now u sure once I withdraw this lawsuit I wont be held on perjury after I tell the truth about me not recalling anything about who shot me,” Bradley wrote Pickering, according to Yahoo! Sports. Bradley was referring to the civil suit he filed against Hernandez.\nSEE ALSO \nAaron Hernandez killed two men over spilled drink: witness 0:0 BOSTON — A former friend of ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez... Hernandez’s double-murder trial now seemingly boils down to whom the jury believes. Bradley testified the message was misunderstood, claiming he wanted to tell a pending grand jury that he was unsure who shot him in the face to spare Hernandez criminal charges, but doing so would put him at risk of perjury because his civil suit clearly claims Hernandez shot him.\n“I was trying to figure out how I could testify without getting him criminally [charged],” Bradley testified. “My issue [was that] I would essentially perjure myself if I file in a civil matter that Mr. Hernandez shot me and then I go to the grand jury and say I don’t know who shot me.”\nHernandez, who is already serving a life sentence in the 2013 fatal shooting of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, has pleaded not guilty. His attorney claimed during opening statements to the jury that Bradley shot the two men in Boston over a drug deal.\nThe tension between the two men was palpable Monday as Bradley entered the packed courtroom, years after they had bonded over many hours together in Connecticut, some at the Foxwoods Resort Casino.\nThe mother of Bradley’s child also testified Thursday, telling jurors that Bradley told her Hernandez shot him. She said Bradley also detailed the double murder and said that he was driving the vehicle when Hernandez fired the shots that killed de Abreu and Furtado, the Globe reports.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T18:21:06.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
