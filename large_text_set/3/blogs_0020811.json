Sharkey allegedly exposed himself to students at a leadership camp last summer. \nAccording to Deadspin, Jim Sharkey had been grilling hot dogs at the camp when he allegedly decided to put his penis into a hot dog bun and said, \nYou think that is a big dog — take a look at this. \nSomehow, Sharkey, who worked at Ferris High School, wasn’t slapped with anything more than a suspension. The man has been suspended since February 1, but the details of the allegations against him were just now made public. \nNot only was the 11-year coach only hit with a suspension, but he was still allowed to coach the 2016 high school football season. \nIt wasn’t until more students began to come forward about the hot dog bun incident that Sharkey was placed on paid administrative leave. \nHere’s a clip of Sharkey talking football. \nAccording to the Spokesman-Review, the first student spoke out against Jim Sharkey’s lewd acts on August 31 of last year. The coach denied the allegations immediately , saying they were “absolutely false” and “a complete lie.” \nSharkey was then asked by someone would lie about something so serious. He said, \nMaybe they want me fired. \nStill, there was no evidence to verify the claims against him. That’s what allowed him to continue coaching. \nHowever, more and more students started to come forward about the allegations saying the witnessed him allegedly put his penis in a hot dog bun and show it to students. \nOne student even reported a separate incident after she claimed Sharkey allegedly called her a “puck slut” and a “puck bunny” because she was friends with hockey players at Ferris High School. \nDuring a “name clearing” held on January 31, the football coach confessed to using those terms. He also stated he had called a student a “dipshit” at one point. \nI think some of this stuff is taken out of context, but I did say these things. \nAs for the hot dog bun incident, though, Sharkey still says he didn’t do it. In notes regarding allegations taken by the school district’s Director of Certified Personnel Mary Templeton, Sharkey concluded, \nThis is a witch hunt. I do a lot for this school. It is going to be difficult to replace me at this time. This is my life – this is all I do. \nAs of right now, the investigation is ongoing.
