No pack drafting, no Big One — hopefully — but a lot of action. Sunday’s race will be the last one on the worn-out, 20-year-old Atlanta racing surface, which chews up tires the way Darlington used to. After this race, it’s repave time at the track. Sunday also will be the first race with the new even-lower downforce package for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. It should be a heck of a show from the 1.54-mile Atlanta track. Atlanta will also provide a chance for some of NASCAR’s stars to bounce back from subpar finishes at Daytona. Here are six top drivers looking for a better weekend this time around. Mike Dinovo Mike DiNovo-USA TODAY Sports 6 Matt Kenseth A two-time Daytona 500 winner, Kenseth finished last in this year’s Great American Race after being collected in Kyle Busch’s crash. Nobody likes to finish last, especially not when you have a fast car. Peter Casey Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports 5 Dale Earnhardt Jr. NASCAR’s 14-time most popular driver was stellar in hid Can-An Duel 150 race and in Daytona 500 qualifying, where he wound up on the outside of Row 1. But he got taken out when Kyle Busch popped a tire. At Atlanta, Earnhardt has the second best average finish of any driver in the race. 4 Brad Keselowski Another one of the Daytona 500 favorites who got clipped in a wreck not of his own making, Keselowski is hunting his first Atlanta victory. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 3 Clint Bowyer At Daytona, Bowyer was so happy to be in a fast car — and so disappointed when he got wrecked out. The Stewart-Haas Racing Fords were great at Daytona and ought to be in Atlanta, too. Jasen Vinlove Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports 2 Kyle Busch A catastrophic tire failure took Busch and two of his fellow Toyota drivers out of the Daytona 500. You better believe he’s going to have the bit between his teeth at AMS, where he won his first race with Joe Gibbs Racing in 2008. Peter Casey Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports 1 Jimmie Johnson In three races at Daytona, Johnson was caught up in four crashes, split equally between his own mistakes and those of others. After hitting everything but the lottery in Daytona, Johnson will be looking to add a sixth Atlanta win.
