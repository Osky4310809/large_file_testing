It’s not going to stop me from doing a live event in the future. But it will make me less trusting of using anyone outside of my own team.\" \nHer manager, Stella Bulochnikov had a lot to say following the performance. \nIn a letter, she reportedly wrote: \"You know her inner ears were NOT working and your entire production team did not set her up to win. \n\"AND MARIAH KEPT TELLING THEM ON STAGE IN REAL TIME.
