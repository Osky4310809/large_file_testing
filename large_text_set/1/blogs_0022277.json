The FC crew debate the Prem's most high profile match of the weekend, and finally give Pep Guardiola some tactical credit. \nPep Guardiola is already considering extending his time at Manchester City despite only beginning a three-year-contract at the start of the season. The Catalan coach is reportedly ready to stay at the Etihad for five years in an attempt to turn the side into one capable of challenging for the Champions League. \nGuardiola had raised doubts over his future when he claimed he was \"approaching the end of my career\" in an NBC interview in January but quickly dismissed such suggestions he is going to retire early and is now ready to lengthen his stay. \nHere are five reasons why it makes perfect sense for Guardiola to consider staying longer. \n1. He needs time \nGuardiola has defended the quality of his players but in reality, he took over a squad that is not at the level he was used to at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. \nAn overhaul of the first team began in his first transfer window, with nine new players arriving, and it's set to continue this summer with City set to spend heavily again on at least three defenders, a midfielder and a goalkeeper. On top of that, Guardiola needs to bring down the average age of the squad, with doubts over the futures of Yaya Toure, Pablo Zabaleta, Gael Clichy, Bacary Sagna, Jesus Navas and Willy Caballero -- all are in their 30s and out of contract in the summer. \nHe has already put his faith in youngsters such as Raheem Sterling (22), John Stones (22), Leroy Sane (21) and Gabriel Jesus (19), who are set to be the future of the club for years to come. \n2. Failure will affect Pep's legacy \nGuardiola enjoyed huge success at his previous clubs to earn a reputation as arguably the best coach in the world, with his Barca team seen as one of the greatest of all time. But there are some who doubt his credentials , particularly after not delivering the Champions League trophy at Bayern as Jupp Heynckes had done immediately before he took over. \nThis season is in danger of being Guardiola's first without a trophy, with City out of the EFL Cup and all but out of the Premier League title race, leaving just the FA Cup and Champions League to play for. But he has always insisted he needs time to adapt to life in Englandb and turning City around will enhance his reputation as one of the greatest coaches ever. \n3. Opportunities to nurture Academy talent \nAt Barca, Guardiola's side was built around homegrown talent with Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Pedro graduating from the famed La Masia academy. He also helped to transform Lionel Messi into the best player in the world by giving him complete trust and belief. \nGuardiola hasn't been able to do the same at City so far, with youngsters like Pablo Maffeo, Aleix Garcia and Tosin Adarabioyo only given a handful of games. But there's plenty of talent coming through the Etihad Academy and Guardiola has already identified exciting young talent who have huge potential. Brahim Diaz (17) and Phil Foden (16) have already been involved in the first team while Jadon Sancho (16) has been impressing in the youth team. \nCity chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak says Guardiola will get young players into the team and the Spaniard now needs to try to make those youngsters regulars in his side. \n4. He's happy in Manchester \nSources have told ESPN FC that Guardiola's family have settled quickly in Manchester and The Sun reports he is bringing over in architects from Barcelona to customise his city-centre apartment. \nDespite some terse recent post-match interviews , Guardiola is enjoying the challenge of the Premier League and is determined to bring success to City. \n\"I just want to produce optimism -- to believe we can do this,\" he has said . \"Never did I say or complain the club is not good enough, never did I say that and never I will.\" \n5. His style will succeed \nGuardiola is trying to transform City's playing style, introducing a high-pressing game to dominate possession and control the match. And he is determined it will succeed in England despite critics saying he should take a more pragmatic approach. \nThat style was horribly undone in heavy defeats at Leicester City and Everton but when they get it right, City look like one of the best sides in the Premier League. They were better in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Tottenham and were also on top in the 3-1 defeat to Chelsea until three late goals. City were also impressive in 2-1 wins over Manchester United and Arsenal. \nThere is every reason to believe that Guardiola's style will succeed when personnel improvements are made in key areas that are currently costing his side dearly. \nJonathan is ESPN FC's Manchester City correspondent.
