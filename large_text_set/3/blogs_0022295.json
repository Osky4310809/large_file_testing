Watch the Sky F1 pundits' views and have your say in the poll!  46am The Sky F1 team look at whether Valtteri Bottas can challenge Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton Ahead of a 2017 Formula 1 season packed full of intriguing sub-plots, one question remains particularly tantalising: How will Valtteri Bottas fare against Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes? \nFor the first time since he joined Nico Rosberg at Brackley in 2013, Hamilton is pitched against a new driver on the other side of the garage. \nWhile Hamilton, with three World Championships and 53 race wins, is a proven front-runner, Bottas has yet to sample race-winning machinery, although has finished on the podium nine times and is yet to be outscored by a team-mate in his four seasons of F1. \nBut how will the 27-year-old perform in his first season at Mercedes? \nWe put that question to Sky F1's Damon Hill, Anthony Davidson and Johnny Herbert, and you can watch the former drivers give their views in the video above. \nYou can then have your say in the new team-mate duel at Mercedes in the poll below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:01:19.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
