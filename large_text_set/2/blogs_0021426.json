Chiron grows up poor and black in low-income housing in Miami, and he’s also slowly trying to come to terms with his homosexuality, something he only confronts in fits and starts. The film’s unusual structure — it’s essentially three short stories about the same character, played by three different actors — makes it unlike anything else out there, and its poetic direction and performances take it to the next level. \nAvailability: In theaters; also available for digital download and on DVD February 28 13 My Life as a Zucchini × \nNominated for: Animated Feature \nRank: 13 \nThis Swiss animated film (dubbed in English with a terrific cast led by Nick Offerman) essentially asks, \"What if the Peanuts gang lived in a group home for troubled children?\" Young Zucchini finds himself a ward of the state after his mother dies, and his darkly whimsical adventures with the other kids in foster care somehow perfectly walk the line between taking Zucchini’s journey seriously and becoming too depressing to bear. \nAvailability: In some theaters 6 O.J.: Made in America × \nNominated for: Documentary Feature \nRank: 6 \nNearly eight hours long, this documentary played briefly in theaters to qualify for the Oscars before airing in four parts on ESPN (where most viewers saw it). But regardless of whether you saw it in theaters or on TV, it’s a mesmerizing opus that turns the life and trial of O.J. Simpson into a Rosetta stone for understanding America’s troubled relationships with race, celebrity, gender, class, and itself. That director Ezra Edelman has made a movie both this engaging and this long feels miraculous. \nAvailability: Streaming in three parts on Hulu; also available on DVD and for digital download 50 A Man Called Ove × \nNominated for: Foreign Language Film (Sweden), Makeup and Hairstyling \nRank: 50 \nThis Swedish film about a grumpy old man who becomes marginally less grumpy thanks to meeting some cute young kids, their winsome parents, and a fuzzy cat is something you’ve seen dozens of times before. But a good cast and some genuine feeling carry the day for most of the movie’s running time — before the ending tips over into unmitigated schmaltz. Still, there are worse ways to spend an evening. \nAvailability: Digital download and on DVD 16 Silence", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:04:31.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
