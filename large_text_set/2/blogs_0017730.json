When you look at what’s happening in Germany, when you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden -- Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers, they’re having problems like they never thought possible.\nBut once again, those attacking Trump didn't care to do their homework. The chorus was immediate and shrill. Wrote Vox :\nThe only problem is that nothing happened the prior night in Sweden.\nAsked former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt:\nSweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?\nBut those who are cackling today about the idiot Trump and his imaginary terror in Sweden should pause to examine some recent headlines. Trump himself tweeted :\n“My statement as to what’s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @ FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.”\nAnd :\n“Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!”\nOn Friday night, according to Heat Street:\nFox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed documentarian Ami Horowitz about his upcoming film about violence involving migrants in Sweden. Horowitz claims that the Swedish government is downplaying an uptick in violence that followed a wave of refugee migration into the country.\n...\nHorowitz’s film shows a country that is deep in denial about a growing problem of migrant violence -- including a sharp uptick in rape over the last five years. Horowitz claims that the increase correlates directly to Sweden’s refugee acceptance program; the country has taken in more than 190,000 Muslim immigrants in the same time frame.\nThe migrant violence is just part of the problem. The UK’s Express reported several weeks ago:\nSweden’s Prime Minister was brutalised in Parliament for allowing Sweden to crumble into a lawless state .\nThis was not hyperbole:\nIn February 2016, the National Criminal Investigation Service was forced to admit more than 50 areas in were now labelled as \"no-go zones\" as sex crimes, attacks on police, drug dealing and children carrying weapons were common occurrences.\nMalmo, Sweden’s third-largest city, has been so hard hit by crime and car fires, the Social Democrats demanded soldiers should be sent in to reestablish law and order.\nMalmo is Sweden’s most Muslim-dominated area . On New Year’s Eve, Muslim mobs there fired rockets at crowds and police. The Express reported in November 2016:\n[M]igrant sex attacks against children in the Swedish city of Malmö could increase following a spate of incidents in broad daylight , police have warned. The city of Malmö has seen a huge rise in migrant crime in recent months. https://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2017/02/21/trump-is-completely-right-about-the-crisis-in-sweden/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.mediaite.com/online/did-trump-think-there-was-an-attack-in-sweden-because-of-a-tucker-carlson-segment/", "https://www.jihadwatch.org/2017/01/sweden-muslims-fire-rockets-at-crowds-and-police-on-new-years-eve-in-malmo", "http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/443073/rape-violence-sweden-immigration-refugees-ami-horowitz-video", "https://twitter.com/FoxNews", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/833681539997253636", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-remarks-sweden-create-debate-confusion/story?id=45596087", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/833435244451753984", "http://www.vox.com/world/2017/2/19/14662244/trump-sweden-terrorist-attack-fake"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:48:05.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
