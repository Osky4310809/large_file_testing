He told a group of employees that he had made the CIA his first official stop to dispel the notion that he is at odds with the nation’s intelligence community. That’s a notion arose largely from Trump’s earlier dismissal of intelligence reports that concluded the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential elections to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. \nRepeating his Friday inaugural address, Trump told his CIA audience that “radical Islamic terrorism … has to be eradicated off the face of the Earth.”\nAbout 10 minutes into his remarks, Trump made a detour to take a swipe at media reporting The CIA employees laughed and applauded when he called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on Earth.” \nHe went on to say that he felt the media had misrepresented the size of Friday’s inaugural crowd. Some widely circulated but hard-to-verify estimates have pegged the Trump crowd at 250,000 and compared it to the throng of about 1.8 million said to have attended President Barack Obama’s first inaugural.\n“I get up this morning and I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field,” Trump said. “I say, ‘Wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, it looked like a million, a million and a half people.’ They showed a field where there was practically no one standing there. And they said, ‘Donald Trump did not draw well.'”\nTrump insisted, twice, that the crowd extended all the way to the Washington Monument, about 1.3 miles to the west of the U.S. Capitol, where Friday’s ceremony was held. \nThe report of 250,000 people in attendance is “not bad, but it’s a lie,” Trump said. “We had 250,000 people literally around, you know, in the little bowl we constructed, that was 250,000 people. The rest of the, you know, 20-block area all the way to the Washington Monument was packed. So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty, and I think they’re going to pay a big price.”\nSeveral media organizations showed comparative views of the Obama and Trump crowds. For instance, from the PBS NewsHour: \nPBS NewsHour on Twitter Comparison: President Trump and Barack Obama’s #Inauguration crowds #DayOne https://t.co/bmm9G8zOUF\n\nCNN , The New York Times and the Washington Post also analyzed the Obama-Trump crowds, and all concluded that Trump’s was significantly smaller. \nSpicer, the White House press secretary, said the media “was engaged in false reporting.”\n“Photos of the inauguration proceeding were framed in a way to minimize enormous support that had gathered on the mall,” Spicer said. ”\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/21/sean-spicer-rips-the-media-for-lying-about-crowd-sizes-at-trumps-inauguration/#ixzz4WRXoyljP\nDuring his CIA visit, Trump did not mention another major gathering in Washington: Saturday’s Women’s March. That gathering, too, is believed to have drawn far more people than Trump’s inaugural.\nVox on Twitter Judging by aerial photos, the crowd at the #WomensMarch is probably bigger than the inauguration of President Trump. https://t.co/w1B49UY1zb\n\nBelow: A transcript of Trump’s remarks at the CIA. They occur just after the 10:00 mark of The New York Times’ video above.\nAs you know, I have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth, and they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just wanted to let you know — the reason you’re the No. 1 stop — it is exactly the opposite, exactly, and they understand that, too. \nI was explaining about the numbers — we did a thing yesterday, the speech — did everyone like the speech? You had to like it. So I’ve been given [unintelligible]. But we had a massive field of people, you saw that — packed. \nI get up this morning and I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I say, ‘Wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, it looked like a million, a million and a half people.’ They showed a field where there was practically no one standing there. And they said, ‘Donald Trump did not draw well.’ I said, ‘It was almost raining.’ The rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and said, ‘We’re not going to let it rain on your speech.’ … We have something that’s amazing. We had — it looked, honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on the thing, and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field, and it said we drew 250,000 people. \nNow, that’s not bad, but it’s a lie. We had 250,000 people literally around, you know, in the little bowl we constructed, that was 250,000 people. The rest of the, you know, 20-block area all the way to the Washington Monument was packed. So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty, and I think they’re going to pay a big price.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:57:26.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
