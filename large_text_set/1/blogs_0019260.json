And all around the world, celebrities attended women’s marches . There was no special treatment; they were bundled up in warm clothes, marching down the street with the rest of us!\nThat’s right, numerous celebs braved the gigantic crowds to express their support. If ever there was a feeling of unity and a strong, palpable mentality of being able to achieve great things together, that time and that feeling is now.\nI marched for my daughters, for my friends, for strangers, for myself, for Phoebe here in this picture who I met as she motivated everyone she came across. My march wasn't driven by hate. It was rooted in a very simple fact-- we are all equal. I believe everyone can agree on that. Thank you to everyone who marched all over the world. I felt so hopeful and deeply grateful. #whyimarch \nA photo posted by Blake Lively (@blakelively) on Jan 22, 2017 at 7:05pm PST \n@womensmarch ✊️ \nA video posted by Emma Watson (@emmawatson) on Jan 22, 2017 at 9:36am PST \nProud \nA photo posted by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Jan 21, 2017 at 11:04pm PST \nDrew Barrymore’s post came with an extra special message.

In fact, now more than ever, we need to get to work and keep the momentum going by researching our local politicians, calling our representatives, discussing the issues with friends and family, reading the updates (and enacting them) on the women’s march website , and remembering that positive change might happen slowly, but it does happen.\nTo all the celebs and regular civilians who marched in support of women’s rights, we’re with you every step of the way, and we can do this!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:23:46.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
