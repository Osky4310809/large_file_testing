That’s what he said after the Miami Heat ’s practice on Thursday.\n“I really don’t even want to talk about it,” Whiteside told The Miami Sun Sentinel. \nWhiteside was originally ninth overall among Eastern Conference forwards when the original voting came out. In the newest round of voting released Thursday, Whiteside had dropped out of the top-10.\n\"It's more so a gimmick,\" Whiteside said. \"I look at guys and they just do stuff to win the fans over, make jokes on Twitter to get people to vote for them. It ain't got nothing to do really with talent.\"\nWho could Whiteside be talking about? Oh, hmm. I WONDER WHO.
