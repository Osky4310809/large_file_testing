Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, has also expressed interest in challenging the incumbent senator. \nCastro is expected to reach a decision by mid-April whether or not to run for Senate in 2018. If he does decide to run, he will be without his long-time campaign manager, Christian Archer. \nArcher, a veteran Texan political operative, has been successfully wooed by O’Rourke, who he promised to support if he were to run for Senate.   \n“I’m truly inspired by the guy,” Archer told Express News of O’Rourke. “He is a really cool dude.” \n“There is a level of coolness to him that’s Kennedy-esque. I know people keep saying he looks like Bobby Kennedy. You know what? He’s got this aura around him. It’s neat, because he can talk about anything.” \nAs a Democrat in a red state, O’Rourke will face an uphill battle against Cruz. With 25 seats to defend in 2018, the DNC is not expected to devote resources to the Texas Senate race. \nHowever, O’Rourke doesn’t appear to be phased by the challenge, and insisted that it’s possible for a Democrat victory in Texas.
