According to Ryan’s account of the encounter, Omarosa attempted to “physically intimidate” her while explaining that she was collecting compromising information on the White House correspondent. \nHowever, per Manigault, it was actually Ryan who was the bully in the confrontation: \n“She came in [to the White House press-staff area] hot,” hurling insults at her, Manigault said. “She came in with an attitude. For her to characterize me as the bully — I’m so glad we have this tape … because it’s ‘liar, liar, pants on fire’ ” in Ryan’s case, Manigault said. \nSeveral reporters, including Fox News’ John Roberts, have listened to portions of the tape. Roberts said the parts he heard included “terse words and accusations,” but it didn’t really “amount to a confrontation.” He also noted that he didn’t hear the word “dossier.” \nIn response to the recording and sharing of a tape that was made without her knowledge, Ryan compared it to the era of Richard Nixon. \nRyan said she was not aware that her run-in with Manigault last week was recorded. “I didn’t know she was taping it,” she said. “This is about her trying to smear my name. This is freaking Nixonian.” \nRyan further noted that Omarosa only shared selected pieces of the conversation with reporters because she wasnts to “spin it like a catfight” and that it is “about her smearing me.” \nThe Washington Post spoke to several veteran White House journalists and they explained that while it is somewhat common for officials to record interviews it is “unheard of to do so without a reporter’s prior knowledge.” \nIn the past, Manigault has said that every critic of President Donald Trump “will have to bow down to” him. On Election Night, she pointed out that Trump is “keeping a list” of Republicans who voted against him. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:06:56.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
