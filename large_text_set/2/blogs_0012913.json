I brag about its qualities like a proud mom of an honor student. Sorry, besties, but it's about to get worse. The Becca Cosmetics Prismatic Amethyst Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed is here, and it's everything I've ever wanted in a highlighter. Plus, it comes in holographic packaging that, I'll admit, distracted me for a good five minutes. So why am I obsessed with this certain shade?

Like most people, I enjoy a good late night binge session with Netflix, which unfortunately leaves my face looking dull in the morning. But a sweep of purple highlighter on my cheekbones instantly brightens the skin and basically adds five years to my life. Knowing my obsession, you could probably imagine my reaction when I discovered The Becca Cosmetics Prismatic Amethyst Shimmering Skin Perfector Pressed . The product is intensely pigmented, so a little goes a long way. On the tops of my cheekbones, the highlighter gives off a soft gold sheen. But when the light hits it at a certain angle, the color shifts to a gorgeous lilac. It's like living as Hannah Montana. When you look at my face straight on, I look like a normal human with gold highlighter on. But from an angle, I transform into an purple alien goddess. Ok, I might have gone too far there, but this highlighter is that out of this world. You May Also Like Makeup These are the Lipsticks in Fifty Shades Darker Worn by Dakota Johnson The best part?

Just as I suspected , the addition of pale gold and rose pigments in the purple highlighter makes the product universally flattering and not chalky. Typically, purple highlighters have a pearly base that can look ashy on darker skin tones. Here are some swatches if you don't believe me.

You can also use the highlighter as an eye shadow, lipstick topper for a unicorn tear -like finish, or a metallic liner.
