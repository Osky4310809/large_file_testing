To protect her delicate skin, she must wear bandages from her hands to her shoulders and from the waist down, as well as socks on her arms and legs to stop her from removing the bandages. \n  \nFor her birthday on Wednesday, Makenzie’s family started the “Rock the Socks 1,000” campaign. The goal is to get 1,000 people to posts photos of themselves wearing socks on their hands using the hashtag #RTS1000 to help raise awareness for epidermolysis bullosa. \nSo far, Makenzie’s mother, Liz Cadmus, says hundreds of people, including Debbie Gibson and New York Islanders John Tavares and Johnny Boychuk, have posted their “Rock the Socks” photos onto Facebook and Twitter. \n“It’s been just incredible to see everyone posting pictures,” Cadmus, 36, said. “We really wanted to celebrate this day and we’re all looking forward to a brighter chapter in her life.” Get the Newsday Now newsletter! \nThe best of Newsday every day in your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:43:51.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
