Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com \nJEFFERSON CITY • In the months following a crushing election for Democrats – including his own lost bid for U.S. Senate – former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander has taken on a new task: mobilizing his party. \nWhether it's questioning how much Democrats \"accidentally divided the country,\" retweeting Obamacare success stories or making appearances on cable news shows , Kander has kept himself busy. \nAnd on Tuesday, he announced the launch of a voting rights advocacy group, Let America Vote, “dedicated to winning the public debate over voter suppression in the United States.” \nAs a 527 organization, Let America Vote is tax-exempt and can raise unlimited money for general political activities. Its website, still under construction, includes a link for donations. \n“We’ve got Jason on the road, speaking out and raising awareness of the alt-right assault on voting rights,” the donation page reads. \n“For the first time, politicians intent on denying certain Americans the right to vote will first have to consider the political consequences,” Kander said in a statement. \nThe organization’s advisory board is made up of prominent Democrats, including state legislators, activists and former members of President Barack Obama’s administration. Rev. Starsky Wilson, co-chair of the Ferguson Commission, is among the names. \nIn the announcement, Kander cites his experience as Missouri Secretary of State, where he vocally opposed a new photo ID requirement to vote that was approved by overwhelmingly by both voters and state lawmakers. \nHis last day in office, he made one parting shot at Republicans on that very subject, warning them about court challenges in other states who’d passed similar laws. \n“You can protect the integrity of elections without stopping anyone from voting,” Kander said while speaking to the Missouri House of Representatives. “If you choose to follow the example of Wisconsin and North Carolina, I guess we’ll see you in court.” \nGOP lawmakers didn't appreciate the lecture, saying it was out of line and that voters had rejected Kander's point of view on Nov. 8. \nKander’s effort to unseat incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt – a Republican fixture in Missouri politics now in his second term in the U.S. Senate – may have come up short, but speculation of his future plans to run for office has grown. \nIn the meantime, the Kansas City Democrat has been interviewed on CNN and MSNBC, penned op-eds in papers like the Washington Post and keynoted a Progress Iowa dinner in Des Moines. \n\"I don't know what I'm going to do next, or if I'll ever put my name on a ballot again,\" he admitted to the crowd in Iowa. \"But I know I'm not leaving this cause behind.\" \nKander, an Afghanistan veteran who ran on an ethics reform platform, spoke in Iowa about where he thought the Democratic Party was heading, advising against a strategy that solely criticizes President-elect Donald Trump. \n\"If I've learned nothing else from being a progressive in a red state, it is this. Voters will forgive you for holding a position you don't agree with, so long as they know you are really saying what you believe and you include them in your vision for the country,\" Kander said.
