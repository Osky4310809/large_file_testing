March 20, 2017 at 8:32 pm | UPDATED: Dobbs: A lesson for Trump on choosing the right battles \nFORT COLLINS — Colorado State athletic director Joe Parker looks at home in his hard hat, and his ability to navigate through the construction of the on-campus stadium is well practiced, as are his descriptions of the different rooms and areas inside the facility. \n“There’s always something different to see,” Parker said during a tour of the facility with media Monday. “You can visualize it, but when it’s right in front of you, it’s pretty special.” Related Articles March 8, 2017 CSU’s Hayden Hunt, a NFL hopeful, on why punters are like snipers, hate for CU, more in Q&A \nThe project is still on time and on budget, according to Parker, with the football team planning on moving into the west side of the stadium in mid June. In the beginning of August, the academic and alumni aspects will be settling in on the east. \nIn the coming months, the field surface will be put in place, donor bricks will be laid outside the stadium and the LED scoreboard will be installed. \nThe Rams’ new practice fields will be on the west side of the stadium, meaning the large and upgraded locker room will serve the team every day of the week, not just on fall Saturdays. With the exception of the Anderson Academic Center, each aspect of the team’s needs will be taken care of in one centralized location.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:49:36.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
