The FC guys discuss Juve's place among the Champions League favourites as they take an unbeaten record into the quarterfinals. \nJuventus' reign continues atop the Power Rankings after another brilliant week for Max Allegri's team. Who will catch them? Anyone? \n1. Juventus (no change) \nIt's as-you-were at the top after the leaders claimed a pair of one-goal wins. And it was a tale of two Paulo Dybala penalty kicks as Juve first saw off Milan in Serie A with a controversial, injury-time spot kick and then completed a Champions League last-16 win vs. Porto. \n2. Bayern Munich (no change) \nCarlo Ancelotti's side lead the Bundesliga by 10 points with 10 games left after they beat Eintracht Frankfurt while RB Leipzig lost to Wolfsburg. Bayern's victory featured two more goals for Robert Lewandowski, taking his career tally for the club to 100. \n3. Real Madrid (no change) \nSergio Ramos is Madrid's problem solver, and so it proved again with his winner vs. Real Betis. A word, too, for Keylor Navas, who made a horrible mistake to concede a goal but later produced a match-winning save. Just sticking up for a fellow goalkeeper! \n4. Chelsea (+1) Chelsea gritted out an FA Cup quarterfinal win over Man United to stay on course for a domestic double. \nThe Premier League leaders moved closer to the first double in club history as they beat Manchester United in the FA Cup quarterfinals. N'Golo Kante was a somewhat unlikely match winner, while Eden Hazard turned in a dazzling display. \n5. Monaco (+2) \nEveryone seemed to think that Monaco's win over Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16 was a fluke, but really, Leonardo Jardim's team are the real deal. Les Monegasques warmed up for their midweek heroics with a 2-1 win over Bordeaux over the weekend to preserve their three-point lead at the top of Ligue 1. Kylian Mbappe continues to score big goals (and enhance his transfer value) as teams struggle to figure out how to take Monaco down. \n6. Barcelona (-2) \nLuis Enrique's changes, as well as an inspired Deportivo, saw Barcelona slump to defeat while looking nothing like the side that stunned Paris Saint-Germain. The Deportivo result, plus Real Madrid's win, means Barca drop to second in La Liga, two points and one game adrift. \n7. Borussia Dortmund (-1) \nThomas Tuchel's side suffered a tight 2-1 loss at the weekend to fellow top-three challengers Hertha Berlin, but Christian Pulisic's run of games, and fine form, has them looking well-placed for another deep Champions League run and a strong finish in the Bundesliga. \n8. Tottenham (no change) \nGiven that Harry Kane had earlier limped off with what turned out to be ankle ligament damage, it will have heartened Spurs fans to see their side score six vs. Millwall. Son Heung-Min, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and others will be vital in Kane's absence. \n9. Benfica (no change) \nAfter being dumped out of the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund, Benfica found some comfort in league play with a 4-0 thrashing of Belenenses. The result was enough to keep Rui Vitoria's side one point clear of Porto at the top of the Primeira Liga. \n10. Feyenoord (new) \nLast but definitely not least, some love for the Eredivisie in the form of the Dutch league leaders. They've won six of their last seven games and thrashed AZ 5-2 at the weekend, with Nicolai Jorgensen notching a hat trick and the ageless Dirk Kuyt (yes, he's still playing) also getting on the score sheet. Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side have a four-point lead over second-place Ajax with just eight games remaining. \nDropping out: Sevilla. \nShaka Hislop played for over 10 years in the Premier League and represented Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup.
