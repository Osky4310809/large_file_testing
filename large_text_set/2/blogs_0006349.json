But spending your working day indulging your love of chocolate isn't really an option for most people.\nSEE ALSO: Controversial tweet ranking chocolate has caused online chaos\nMondelēz International — which makes Cadbury and Oreo — is hiring a chocolate taster for the very important task of sampling and giving feedback on chocolate products and cocoa beverages. And it's basically every chocolate lover's dream come true.\nThe part-time position — which is LinkedIn's first ever UK job of the week — requires someone to spend 7.5 hours per week trying out and giving \"objective and honest\" feedback on products.\nThe successful — and very lucky — candidate will work with a team of panelists to share opinions and collaborate to reach an agreement on taste. In short, they'll spend a lot of time talking about chocolate with fellow chocolate lovers.\nAccording to the job description, the desired candidate will need to have a \"passion\" for confectionary and \"taste buds for detection\" — whatever that means. They'll also need to be eager to try new and \"inventive\" products.\nBut enthusiasm is all it takes. The perfect candidate also needs to be honest when giving feedback, and they'll need a \"communicative personality\" to build good relationships with your panel.\nThe job is also location-specific, and it'll require someone to work in the vicinity of Reading, in England. So, bad news for those outside of the UK.
