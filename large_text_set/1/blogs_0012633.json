Whisk some eggs in a bowl, add a pinch of paprika, a grind of black pepper, and touch of salt. Dredge the pizza in the egg and fry in a pan.” \nClick for this resourceful “recipe” below. \nIt’s insanely simple, and can be the springboard for even more dizzying heights of culinary greatness by throwing some fried onions, bacon, or whatever else you have lying around your fridge on there. \nTrust us on this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:05:46.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
