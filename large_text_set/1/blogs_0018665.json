Long Story \nAll this time you might have been switching four letters of the YouTube.com domain to get your dose of porn , but did you know there are hidden videos on YouTube itself. In fact, there are a lot of them. \nPorn pirates (those who lift and post copyrighted adult videos) are posting XXX videos on YouTube using a \"backdoor,\" according to Torrent Freak . \nThe word backdoor sounds like some sneaky and sophisticated method suited for some master criminal, but the way the videos are uploaded really isn't that complicated. All the pirates do is set the videos to \"unlisted,\" which means the video won't appear in search results but is accessible if you have the right link. They also might use \"private,\" which allows the link to be shared with up to 50 YouTube account holders. \nAnd this isn't just happening for a select few — these videos rack up millions of views. \nThe videos do end up getting taken down by YouTube, but it may take up to three weeks, according to California-based adult studio, Dreamroom Productions. \n“There is a big loophole on YouTube. Copyright infringers take advantage of a private-video-share setting. They upload and store videos, and freely use them on third party websites to earn profits,” a spokesperson for Dreamroom said to Torrent Freak. “YouTube should be aware of this. They are allowing the situation to continue by not plugging this hole, which could be done by disabling the sharing function of videos under those special settings.” \nWhile porn tube sites like Pornhub and RedTube have frequently been blamed by the industry for allegedly posting copyrighted videos, Dreamroom says that YouTube itself might be the biggest forum for illegal videos. \n“The world biggest TUBE site may have become one of the world’s largest databases of copyright infringing material,” Dreamroom said. \nAnd to think, people use YouTube when all they need to do is search with four different letters to get their pick of millions of other free videos. Seems like a hassle, no? Own The Conversation Ask The Big Question \nWhy do people watch porn on YouTube when videos are available in so many other places? Drop This Fact \nPornhub's year in review stats came out recently and over 5,000 centuries of porn was viewed on the tube site in 2016.
