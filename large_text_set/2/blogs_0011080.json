The 36-year-old singer claimed that despite having immense success, he was ready to embark on new projects, which solely catered to the music and not to sold-out stadiums. \"We were on a stadium tour, and I just felt like the whole thing was too big,\" Timberlake said to The Hollywood Reporter . “It started as a fun snowball fight that was becoming an avalanche. And, also, I was growing out of it.\" \"I felt like I cared more about the music than some of the other people in the group,\" he added. \"And I felt like I had other music I wanted to make and that I needed to follow my heart.\" Watch Lance Bass Teach You How To Make The Perfect Truffle Chicken Sandwich - In His Home Kitchen!

We started getting that control back towards the end when we started doing the Celebrity album.\" \"I think what he was talking about was on the Pop Odyssey Tour,\" he added. \"It was a crazy time and it felt like it was everything but the music. It was all about the spectacle. The stage is so big and we have mechanical bulls and it's like, well, let's go back to what we do -- the music. So, I understand where he was coming from.\" Despite the group going on a hiatus in the spring of 2002, Bass revealed they all remain in touch. \n\"I've never seen him happier,\" Bass said when asked about Timberlake's baby. \"[He's] so in love with his family.\" \nRELATED: Justin Timberlake Reveals Wife Jessica Biel Broke the News to Him About Oscar Nomination \"I think having a kid completely changes you,\" he added. \"You go from being very selfish about your life, and it's all you really know until you have a family, and then there's this little person that's your life now.

He's just so happy.\" For more on Bass, watch him on compete on My Kitchen Rules , which airs Thursdays on Fox.
