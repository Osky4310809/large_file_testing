Image caption Cards on display in Scribbler and Paperchase \nSharon Little from the Greeting Card Association said there was \"huge demand\" for rude cards. \n\"They've always been popular,\" she said. \n\"You send a card to show that you care about someone - it's sharing a sense of humour. \n\"But you have to know someone really well to choose a card like that for them.\" \nBut not everyone is happy. \nEarlier this year, Paperchase - which stocks more than 4,000 cards - was forced to pull a line of sexually explicit Valentine's cards after some shoppers complained. \nThe cards appeared behind a sign stating \"rude cards here - you have been warned!\" \nBut that wasn't enough to satisfy all customers - especially those with young children . Image caption Paperchase has in-store warnings \n\"Adult cards can undoubtedly polarise customer opinion and this Valentine's Day we took the controversial decision to remove some of the more risqué cards from our stores so that we didn't cause unnecessary offence to customers,\" a Paperchase spokeswoman said. \n\"While this decision proved popular with some, we also had many customers who were disappointed.\" \nPaperchase said their adult cards are only sold in select stores where teams are asked \"to position them on the top shelf, out of sight of children and with a sign\". \nBut the cards certainly don't seem to be putting a dent in the tradition of card sending. \nIn fact, the British public are buying more cards than ever before - with the UK market worth an estimated £1.7 bn . \nSo if you're feeling adventurous this Mother's Day, perhaps go for a more edgier take on the classic. Just make sure you inherited your sense of humour from your mother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:36:23.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
