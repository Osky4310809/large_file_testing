Here’s where things stand through 36 holes in La Jolla: \nLeaderboard: Rose (-8), Hadwin (-7), Snedeker (-7) Ollie Schniederjans (-6), Keegan Bradley (-6), Robert Streb (-5), Brian Harman (-5), Zac Blair (-5), Kevin Streelman (-5), C.T. Pan (-5) \nWhat it means: The overnight leader, Rose is in search of his eighth PGA Tour win and his first since the 2015 Zurich Classic. After struggling with a bad back during the fall and having to withdraw from the Hero World Challenge, Rose finished T-2 two weeks ago at the Sony and continues to ride a resurgent form. One behind, Snedeker is the defending champion and a two-time Farmers winner, while Hadwin is one week removed from shooting 59 at the CareerBuilder and missing out on the title by a shot. At 6 under, Schniederjans is the former top-ranked amateur from Georgia Tech playing his first PGA Tour season after finishing sixth last year on the Web.com money list; Bradley, separately, hasn't won since the 2012 WGC-Bridgestone and has fallen all the way to 115th in the world. \nRound of the day: Kyle Reifers and Derek Fathauer both turned in 5-under 67 on the North Course after rounds of 76 on the South Course on Thursday. Reifers played his final three holes birdie-eagle-birdie to make the cut by one. \nBest of the rest: Tyrone Van Aswegen, Tony Finau and Ryo Ishikawa all played the North Course in 4-under 68. Van Aswegen sits just four off the lead in a tie for 11th. \nBiggest disappointment: Not one member of the marquee grouping of Woods (+4), Day (+2) and Johnson (+2) will play the weekend at Torrey Pines. Other notables to miss the even-par cut include Brooks Koepka (+1), Jimmy Walker (+3), Rickie Fowler (+3), Daniel Berger (+4) and Bryson DeChambeau (+8). \nShot of the day: Will Mackenzie’s hole-out for eagle from 98 yards at the par-5 sixth. \nUnfortunately, that eagle was the only red number during a second-round 76 that otherwise featured four bogeys and a double and left Mackenzie one shot off the cut line. \nQuotes of the day: “The only concern is that I’ve got a long flight ahead of me.” – Woods on his surgically repaired back and his upcoming trip to Dubai \nMore from Tiger: “Playing tournament golf is a little bit different than playing with your buddies at home in a cart.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:51:06.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
