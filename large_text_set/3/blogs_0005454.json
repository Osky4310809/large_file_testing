Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to a deal for a medium-range surface-to-air (MRSAM) missile system to be produced by Israeli Aerospace Industries and India’s Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the Mail Today reports. \nThe deal marks 25 years of cooperative diplomatic ties, The Algemeiner pointed out. © East News/ imago stock&people After Nuke-Capable Missile Test, India Official Lashes Out at Beijing Criticism \n\"The formal clearance for the MRSAM project has been given by the Cabinet committee on security headed by the prime minister last week,\" according to an Indian ministry of defense official.

The weapons are slated to be operational by 2023, the Algemeiner reported. Israeli Aerospace Industries and India’s Defense Research and Development Organization previously completed three flight tests of the weapons system. \"The missile successfully intercepted a moving aerial target in all three tests,\" an Indian Ministry of Defense official said. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:28:35.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
