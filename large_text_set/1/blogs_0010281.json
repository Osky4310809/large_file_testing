There is no factual basis for these claims. \nDescription: Forwarded email / Viral text Circulating since: Aug. 2011 Status: Mostly false (details below) \nExample: Forwarded email text contributed by Peggy K., Sep. 7, 2011: \nFwd: Halal Meat in US Supermarkets \nSOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF \n\"The other day I wrote about Costco stocking their meat counters with \"Halal\" meat.\" So yesterday I shopped for groceries at my local Walmart. As usual, I bought a bag of frozen chicken breasts, but this time I checked to make sure the meat was not labeled \"Halal\". Here’s why. \nHalal is the Islamic term that basically means the meat is lawful to eat for a devout Muslim. What makes it lawful or acceptable is that the meat has been processed in a very specific way. Unlike kosher food, where the physical processing of the meat is the focus, for Islam it is the spiritual component that makes the meat lawful. \nFor lawful (halal) meat in Islam, the animal must be killed while the butcher faces Mecca, and either the butcher cries \"Allah Akbar\" or a tape plays the words over a loud speaker. \nAnn Barnhardt, is a cattle commodities broker, has more about \"Halal.\" \nNEVER buy meat that is marked as \"Halal\". \nI am in the cattle business, and believe me when I tell you that Halal kill plants are CONSTANTLY being cited and shut down by the USDA for horrific, infractions. Most of these plants are in Michigan and upstate New York. \nOne of the things that halal kill plants are notorious for is putting already-dead animals in the human consumption line. They will go pick up a dead cow off of a farm or ranch and instead of putting it in their rendering tank where the resulting \"tankage\" is worth pennies on the dollar as pet food or industrial products, they will shackle the dead animal on the normal kill line and process it as human food which is the highest-dollar product. \nSince Islam teaches dishonesty (taqiyyah) and no regard for one’s neighbor, this kind of sickening behavior is standard. \nHalal plants are also notorious for general citations for filth and uncleanliness. I have toured normal cattle slaughter plants, and guys, you could eat off of the floor. Everything is white and men walk around with water hoses and steam guns constantly keeping everything in a state of spotlessness. \nHalal plants are filthy. A lot of Halal meat is also labeled as \"organic\". \nAgain, don’t be fooled into thinking that \"halal\" means \"better\". It isn’t. I would never, ever knowingly eat halal meat purely from a food safety perspective. \ncontinue reading below our video Top 5 Longest Running TV Shows \nAnalysis: Though it purports to convey authoritative information about the production and quality of halal meats sold in the United States, this text misstates crucial facts and makes a boatload of unsupported allegations. \nIt's true that meat products carrying the halal certification label are becoming more common in U.S. supermarkets, particularly in cities with large Muslim populations such as New York, Los Angeles, and Detroit. Among the national grocery chains offering halal products in select stores are Costco, Wal-Mart, and Safeway. Misrepresenting Halal \nIt's also true that Islamic dietary rules include a requirement to utter the name of Allah when an animal is slaughtered, but there's much more to halal than that. The email is incorrect when it states that the main difference between kosher and halal rules is that the former are focused on processing while the latter are focused on \"the spiritual component.\" Both sets of laws have a spiritual component, and both lay down basic physical requirements for the sourcing and slaughter of animals and the proper handling of meats. \nThe Arabic word halal means \"permitted\" or \"allowed.\" According to About.com's Islam expert , Muslims are allowed to eat \"what is 'good' (Qur'an 2.168) — that is, what is pure, clean, wholesome, nourishing, and pleasing to the taste. In general, everything is allowed ( halal ) except what has been specifically forbidden.\" \nHere's an abbreviated list of foods that are prohibited ( haram ): dead meat (i.e. carcass of an already-dead animal) blood", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:45:46.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
