Forget about narratives and team accomplishments for one second ( let the folks who scream nonsense on your television for a living take care of that ), and take some time to appreciate what we just watched him do in Dallas and what we've been watching him do for the last three months. This is the best we've ever seen the quarterback position played. \nThe numbers are ridiculous. Over the last nine games, Rodgers has thrown 24 touchdowns agaisnt one interception. But the numbers really don't do what the Packers quarterback is doing any justice. It's how he's compiling those numbers that is completely astonishing. \nRodgers just plays the quarterback position differently. He's all of the best quarterback archetypes mashed into one player. The 33-year-old is a pre-snap wizard, recognizing what the defense is up to as soon as it lines up. He throws with the anticipation and timing Bill Walsh had in mind when he created the West Coast offense. He makes plays with his legs like the great scrambling quarterbacks in NFL history. He avoids turnovers like a game manager but remains a gun slinger. \nRodgers put his entire skill-set on display in the Packers' thrilling 34-31 win in Dallas, which sent his team to the NFC title game for the third time in his career. \nHow many \"WOW\" plays did Rodgers make? Too many to include them all in this post, but we'll try. There was his first touchdown pass that came after he drew the defense offside, setting up a free play. Rodgers fit the ball into the tiniest of openings… This Aaron Rodgers pass is the definition of threading the needle, if I've ever seen it. pic.twitter.com/GyOEj4Hi3E — Football Posts (@FballPosts) January 15, 2017 \nThere's this bullet of a throw outside of the pocket, showing Rodgers doesn't sacrifice arm strength or accuracy when on the move… — NFL Network (@nflnetwork) January 15, 2017 \nThere was this play-fake that still has the Cowboys front seven looking for the running back… — Green Bay Packers (@packers) January 15, 2017 \nAnd then there was this masterpiece. A 35-yard dart to Jared Cook on the sideline to set up the game-winning field goal. This throw. This throw. It just...words escape us. Aaron Rodgers. #Packers #GBvsDAL (via @NFL ) https://t.co/wShYlzkZ5F \nThat play wouldn't have been possible if Rodgers didn't miraculously hold onto the ball while taking a monster hit in the pocket. Lord, how did Rodgers not fumble that? pic.twitter.com/5AOuXlZiIY — Scott Charlton (@Scott_Charlton) January 16, 2017 \nIf that ball slips free, the game is over and the Cowboys are playing the Falcons next week. Instead it's the Packers traveling to Atlanta for what should be another thriller, matching the MVP favorite, Matt Ryan, against the best player in the league, Rodgers. \nRewind three months. Green Bay was sitting at 4-6 and a lot of people were wondering if Rodgers' days as an elite quarterback were numbered. Believe me, at the time, that thought was not as crazy as it sounds now. Rodgers was struggling. The Packers receivers weren't getting open and it affected his play . \nGreen Bay's offense started to come around when Jordy Nelson returned to his pre-injury form. But the health of Nelson, as evidenced by these last two weeks without him, is not the only reason the Packers look like an entirely different team: Somehow, the most talented quarterback in the league, has raised his game. Rodgers, for having worked through the rough stretch, which stretched back to the 2015 season, is playing the best he ever has. \nHe's better than he was in 2010 when the Packers last lifted the Lombardi Trophy. And he's better than he was when he won the NFL MVP in 2014. This run Rodgers is on is one of the best we've seen from a quarterback in NFL history, and it doesn't look like it's going to end anytime soon.
