[Photo/Agencies] \nSEOUL - The half-brother of top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong-un has been killed in Malaysia, South Korean cable news channel TV Chosun reported on Tuesday citing multiple government sources. Kim Jong Nam, the older half-brother of the DRPK leader and the eldest son of late leader Kim Jong Il, has been found dead in Kuala Lumpur early Monday, the Chosun TV said. He has been based outside the DPRK since he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in 2001. Multiple South Korean government sources were quoted as saying that the half brother seemed to have killed at a Kuala Lumpur airport at about 9 a.m. Malaysian time (0100 GMT) Monday. Yonhap news agency reported that South Korea's foreign and unification ministries declined to confirm the killing.
