While checking out the meat locker at Galatoire's 33 Bar and Steak — the 4-year-old French Quarter steakhouse from the Galatoire's team — Solares spotted a whole, dangling, bone-in, prime rib-eye and asked sous chef Jeff Boullion if he might get a taste. What he received was more than 20 ounces of dry-aged beef with a collection of sauces to boot, a meal fit for a professional carnivore. \nAt Galatoire's 33 Bar and Steak, whole prime rib-eye is aged for 21 days before being cut into portions for the dining room. Each piece is seasoned with just salt and pepper before its time in the broiler, then finished with a brush of brown butter, lemon juice, and red wine vinegar sauce. Watch the video above to see the steak travel from meat locker to plate, and to hear Solares' review of each of the restaurant's four house sauces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T04:15:58.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
