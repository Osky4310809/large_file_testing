It reveals how the #RegressiveLeft sees children and race. They treat them like pawns, so they assume everyone else does too. @jaketapper \n— StompyMech (@Stmpy_Mch) January 10, 2017 \nAnd that, really, is the point. \nNo matter what they proclaim in public, no matter what they rant about in rallies, Democrats know in their hearts that Republicans like Sessions aren’t really racists. Just as they know most Trump voters are not the knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing monsters that seems to populate so much of liberal fantasy these days. (Meryl Streep notwithstanding.) \nThey also know that truth and decency don’t matter. As long as the “optics” are right, as long as the snark is cutting edge, a black man who lives in Los Angeles can feel perfectly free to use social media to insult the young granddaughter and impugn the character of a white man from Alabama, as long as the white man is a Republican. There is no reason for that child to be in his lap in a hearing other than to send an “I’m not racist message” \n— Ira Madison III (@ira) January 10, 2017 \nBecause to a liberal like Madison III, the only reason for a child to be present in such a setting is for political purposes. It couldn’t be because the girl’s parents wanted to support the nominee who was about to step into the lions’ den, and brought their daughter along. It couldn’t be that as a member of the family, she had a right to be present when something magnificent is happening to her grandfather, a man of accomplishments any family would be proud to claim. \nNope. To a liberal sniper in Barack Obama’s Democrat Party, a child has only political purposes. \nIn one sense, that’s an improvement over other Democrat attitudes toward children, which include murdering babies in the womb and selling their dismembered body parts for cash (really, that one’s tough to beat for sheer barbarism). But it’s still a willful denial of the basic humanity of the youngest, most vulnerable members of American society. \nBy the standards of the confirmation process, Democrats had already debased themselves in the Sessions hearing. According to Politico , two protesters arrayed as Ku Klux Klan members had pretended to be in the Kennedy Caucus Room to support Sessions before being evicted. Code Pink anti-war protesters wailed about the veteran senator. \nAll just more embarrassments tattooed on the American body politic from the liberal left for whom nothing is off limits. \nBut it took a deliberately antagonistic, offensive Twitter posting by an MTV “culture writer” in Los Angeles comparing the existence of a young girl to a stolen prop from a big-box toy store to put the liberal debasement of human nature into stark perspective. \nAnd as agit-prop theater goes, it was liberalism at its worst.
