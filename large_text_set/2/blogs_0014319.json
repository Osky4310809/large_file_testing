He added that West is currently “going through processes” while at home focusing on his health and recovering with his family by his side. \nAs Stereogum points out, West is scheduled to premiere his Yeezy Season 5 collection tomorrow at New York Fashion Week. Let’s hope he’s mentally and physically ready for the challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:19:05.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
