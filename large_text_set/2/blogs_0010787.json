Could   \nTV bird watcher Bill Oddie nearly got the new Real Marigold Hotel series off to a tragic start – by drinking deadly poison. \nThe former Goodies star turned his hand to painting in the Indian coastal city of Kochi, where the show is set. \nSo, as Bill dreamed of capturing exotic species on canvas in the exotic local wetlands, a waiter delivered some turpentine for washing his brushes. \nHe said: “I nearly killed myself after that painting thing. \n“At the beginning of the evening one of the guys knocked on the door and put what I thought was a glass of water by my bed but it was turps and I was drinking it. It could have killed me.” \nBased on the movie, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, about retirees going to live in India, the show is back on our screens tomorrow night with a new celebrity cast heading to Kerala. \nAnd show bosses were relieved that Bill was still with them. A source said: “It was pretty horrifying that he thought the turps was water but thankfully Bill realised in time.” Read More The Real Marigold Hotel: Will the likes of Amanda Barrie and Lionel Blair be won over by expat life in India? Mirror columnist Dr Miriam Stoppard is among the show's stars (Photo: PA) \nBill is joined by stars including ex-Corrie star Amanda Barrie, 81, former snooker player Dennis Taylor , 68, Just Good Friends star Paul Nicholas, 72, former Three Degrees singer Sheila Ferguson, 69, and Mirror advice columnist Dr Miriam Stoppard, 79. \nTV chef Rustie Lee, 63, and veteran entertainer Lionel Blair, 88 make up the hardy group of travellers. \nBill, who lives in Hampstead, North London, with wife of 34 years, Laura, formed a friendship with Miriam. \n“We became immediate friends,” Miriam said. “Bill and I were the two sceptics in the group. \n“So they’d be talking about refreshing the soul and all that kind of thing and our eyes would roll a bit because we come from more of a scientific background.” \nSo much so that Bill flatly refused to do the morning yoga sessions – and instead shouted remarks from the balcony. \n“I’d have been a little fat bloke trying to get into positions that only young, thin people should do,” he says.
