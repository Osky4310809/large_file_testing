Fans are speculating that Lamar may be hinting at the release of his fourth album. A post shared by Kendrick Lamar (@kendricklamar) on Mar 23, 2017 at 1:55am PDT \nThis new album would indeed be his fourth since his last offering, untitled unmastered , is considered a compilation.

Unlike other rappers who promote their new music through social media, Kendrick jealously guards his new opus. \nThat didn't stop fans from rejoicing. Some Twitter users are adamant that the To Pimp A Butterfly emcee just announced the first promo image to his new music. Check out some of their tweets below.
