Harry Pratt of the Daily Star reported Shaw \"wants out\" of United after being frozen out of the first-team picture by manager Jose Mourinho . The full-back is desperate to \"revive his career\" after his £30 million move to the Theatre of Dreams fell short of expectations. However, the Red Devils are only likely to recoup half the fee they paid Southampton for the talented defender if he leaves in the summer, per Pratt. PAUL ELLIS/Getty Images The fresh rumours emerged after Shaw's representative denied claims his client will be sold by Mourniho. Agent Jonathan Barnett proclaimed both player and club are \"happy\" with the current situation. Barnett told International Business Times UK's Naveen Ullal : \"I am angry with these reports suggesting Luke Shaw will leave Manchester United in the summer. I am angry at the irresponsible journalism. Luke Shaw is happy at Manchester United, and also Manchester United are happy with him.\" Shaw suffered a serious broken leg last term after beginning the campaign in wonderful form under previous boss Louis van Gaal. The 21-year-old worked hard to reclaim his fitness as he recovered, but he has never been in favour consistently with the self-proclaimed Special One since he took the reins at United. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images The player has made only 11 appearances in the Premier League and UEFA Europa League this season, according to WhoScored.com , but there is hope for Shaw. Mourinho also held back Henrikh Mkhitaryan from the first team for a protracted period, but the manager eventually unleashed his talents when he was ready to conform to the manager's style of play. If Shaw can replicate Mkhitaryan's attitude, he could force his way back into contention. Despite his lack of playing time, Shaw is back in the England squad, and Mourinho recently praised him for his attitude and potential. According to Samuel Lovett of The Independent, Mourinho said: \nIn practical terms we have lots of left backs. It doesn’t look like it but the reality is that Blind, Shaw, Rojo, Darmian are all playing left back and can play there. \nThey are different players. I think the one that should be the best of all in a couple of years - because potentially he should have all the conditions to be the best - is Luke Shaw. In other news, United will battle it out with Arsenal and Liverpool for the signing of Kostas Manolas of Roma. According to the Daily Star (h/t George Bellshaw of Metro ), the Premier League giants all want to capture the Greece international after his impressive displays in the Italian capital. The player has two years left on his current deal, making him a viable target for top sides chasing a high-level centre-back. Giuseppe Bellini/Getty Images Shaw's overall development and psychology were certainly affected by the horrendous injury he suffered last year, but he has displayed glimpses of the world-class player he can eventually be. The young star is one of the best full-backs in his age group in world football, and it would be a huge mistake for Mourinho to sell him at this current juncture. Shaw will become England's first choice in his position in the near future, but Mourinho must give him more playing time in order for him to prove himself to the coach and supporters.
