Melville, who was nominated for her performance in Gary Owen’s Iphigenia in Splott , will star as Mary in the feminist three-hander which explores the effects of society’s objectification of women. She will be joined by Katherine Pearce, who performed in DH Lawrence adaptation Husbands and Sons at the National Theatre, and Samantha Pearl, recently seen in Belarus Free Theatre’s Tomorrow I Was Always a Lion. The production will be directed by 2016 JMK Award runner-up Chelsea Walker, who is part of The Old Vic 12 and has previously directed at the Finborough Theatre and Southwark Playhouse. 20 theatre shows not to miss in 2017 McIntyre, who passed away in 2009, won the Evening Standard’s Most Promising Playwright in 1990 for My Heart’s a Suitcase.
