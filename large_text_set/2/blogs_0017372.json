He says the phrase \"eeny meeny miny moe\" before wielding the bat, which he calls \"Lucille,\" on his victims:\nCredit: Screener TV When a UK couple saw the shirt, though, they did not appreciate the reference: they called the shirt \"offensive.\" \nMethodist minister Ian Lucraft and his wife, Gwen , claimed that the shirt was racist. According to The Mirror he said, \"It was fantastically offensive and I can only assume that no one in the process of ordering it knew what they were doing or were aware of its subliminal messages.\"\nLucraft said this is because the \"Eeny Meeny Miny Moe\" rhyme originally included a racial slur. He said \"everyone knows\" the \"tiger\" was initially \"n \" in the common rhyme.\nCheck out Twitter reactions to the shirt \n\nHe also said the baseball bat was jarring, and added to the offense. \"This image relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America,\" he said . \"It is directly threatening of a racist assault, and if I were black and were faced by a wearer I would know just where I stood.\"\nAfter receiving a letter from Lucraft, Primark chief exec Paul Marchant removed the shirt from stores. A spokesman for the retailer said, \"The T-shirt in question is licensed merchandise for the U.S. television series, The Walking Dead, and the quote and image are taken directly from the show.\"\n\"Any offense caused by its design was wholly unintentional and Primark sincerely apologizes for this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:53:16.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
