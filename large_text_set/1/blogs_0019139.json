Bush “wisely chose not to make a fuss.” \nWhich led Rove to address Trump’s Twitter habits: \nWhat voters tolerated during the campaign now seems inappropriate for a presidential transition and is likely to be thought unacceptable once Mr. Trump takes office. As a candidate, he could punch down at lesser figures and comment carelessly on foreign leaders. But if President Trump continues this in the Oval Office, he will lessen his stature, move markets, poison relationships, and encourage adversaries to make miscalculations. \nHe cites recent polls on Trump’s Twitter habits to say the clear message is “end the compulsive tweeting and, especially, the Twitter wars.” \nYou can read the full op-ed here . \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:48:53.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
