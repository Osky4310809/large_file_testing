And I wanted to protect the graze from the sun and said, ‘Does anyone have a T-shirt?’ And one of her friends said, ‘I’ve got this.’ The friend pulled out the “I ♥ T.S.” tank top . And we all laughed about it. It was a joke.”\nSo there’s the story. But in an time where fake news has permeated social feeds and created discrepancies between what’s real and what’s not, Hiddleston is out here to lay out the facts. He continued, “I was just surprised that it got so much attention. The tank top became an emblem of this thing.”\nBy “this thing,” Hiddleston refers to his relationship with Swift that lived under perpetual scrutiny and rumors . The couple split in September after three months of dating.\nWhile criticizing fake news without addressing the Hiddleswift drama by name, he said, “If you’re under attack, if your values are under attack, if you’re being shamed, if you’re being humiliated, the animal response is to hide in the bush…And the lesson of 2016 is we have to love more, we have to risk more, we have to be braver, we have to be more outspoken.”\nHiddleston stressed that it was just a shirt, people. “Nobody had the context for that story,” he said. “And I’m still trying to work out a way of having a personal life and protecting it, but also without hiding.”\nRead the full GQ article here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:45:32.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
