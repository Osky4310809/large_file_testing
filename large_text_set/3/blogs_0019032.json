Kante: I don’t feel like the best player in the Premier League \nHe said: \"This is the first season for me at Chelsea and for sure when you have the possibility to work more years with the team you can improve, you must improve. It's normal. \n\"This season is very important because my players are understanding my idea of football. They are adapting to my system, to my philosophy of football. We are building something important. \nPhoto: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images \n\"I think my players are fully in my idea of football, fully in the method. When I arrived as a new coach in a new team, you must know your players and have a bit of time to understand the habits, and then to bring them to your idea - but also to show them that your idea is a positive.\" The players on Chelsea’s transfer shortlist The players on Chelsea’s transfer shortlist 1/17 \nThe players on Chelsea's wishlist...
