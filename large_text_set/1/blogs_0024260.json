Don't stress out about the fact that rather than being a \"totally in love\" couple, about to get married, you are fighting over the guest list. It's completely normal to have differences of opinion while planning your big day. Each one of you has your own vision and it's not all magically going to fall in place. While arguments are bound to break out, there are some things that are actually not worth fighting over. There is no right side to these arguments and you'd rather spend that time at a spa, chilling with a large pitcher of Sangria. Trust us! Guest List \nIf you have a budget to consider, ensure that the guest list is exactly what you want but don't fight over the individual guests that the other person is putting on their list. He might want to call his ex and her entire family, but as long as you know that that relationship is over, you don't need to bother. Trust us you have far bigger things to worry about. Matching outfits \nIt's cute to wear the same colour outfits on your big day, but if both of you have your heart set on different colours, then it's better to let go. You both have your own vision for the wedding and it's not fair to have one person compromise for the other Food \nYes you have just the perfect menu decided, but is it worth having a fight over a dessert? You will anyway not get to each much of this food, so it's best to go with the flow. Rituals \nRather than having a wedding only as per your or his traditions, reach a compromise early on. Give each traditional equal importance rather than focusing one just one. Gifts \nWhat gifts you plan to give each other's relatives is not ever going to be a safe topic of discussion. So it's best to not save precious pre-wedding calm time, and avoid having this discussion. Unless absolutely necessary of course!
