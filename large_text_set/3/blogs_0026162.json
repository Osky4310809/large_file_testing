But it also has the unique ability to transform lives and help in the all-round development of young people.\" \nUnder a typically dank, overcast sky in Croydon, south London, Butragueno exhibited some of the silky ball skills he was famous for to mark the launch of Real Madrid's first football school in the United Kingdom. \nAimed specifically at youngsters from deprived backgrounds, it involves weekly training sessions that are combined with wider educational and social activities. The project's location was chosen because the area was badly affected by the 2011 riots and is also home to some of the capital's most disadvantaged communities. \nIt is run in partnership with a local school \"The Cedars,\" the Sports for Unity charity and the Kinetic Foundation, a social sports initiative which was set up in the wake of the riots. \nMore than 80 boys and girls have already been signed up and will be \"taught to live and play the Real Madrid way.\" \n\"As a professional footballer I learned more than just about football,\" Butragueno added. \"It's about discipline, teamwork and character development; good values that have helped me in my wider life. This is what the Real Madrid school can do for these youngsters.\" Butragueno (top right) has hopes that Real Madrid can grow throughout the world. \nTony Jennings, whose nine-year old son Andrew has signed up to attend the school said: \"There's not a lot to do for young people in this area so this is a fantastic opportunity for them to get involved in something positive. Who would have thought that the champions of Europe and one of the world's best clubs would be interested in coming to Croydon?\" \nWhile Andrew added: \"I'm very excited about learning how to play football the Real Madrid way. I'd also love to meet Gareth Bale or Cristiano Ronaldo but I don't think that's going to happen.\" \nIn total, Los Blancos have established football schools in 75 countries attracting more than 50,000 youngsters under the banner of their foundation, the club's charitable arm, but Croydon is its first foray into the United Kingdom. \nThe expansion of Real Madrid football schools forms part of a wider strategy to increase the club's international profile as it competes with the likes of Barcelona and leading Premier League clubs for fans around the world. \nReal Madrid estimate that they have a global fan base of 450 million , while according to Deloitte they have a combined following of 128.9m on social media, compared with Barcelona's 132.8m. \nFor the enthusiastic youngsters queuing up to grab an autograph or a selfie with Butragueno, there was little interest in the significance of Real Madrid's decision to set up shop in a remote corner of south London. \nMany confessed to having to do a bit of extra homework on who he actually was, given that his exploits on the pitch took place long before they were born. \"Thanks to the internet you know who I am,\" joked Real Madrid's former front man. \nBut while the focus of Real Madrid's schools is on social development, uncovering a new Cristiano Ronaldo in Croydon would be a welcome bonus. \nVivek Chaudhary covers FIFA and the financial side of the game for ESPN FC.
