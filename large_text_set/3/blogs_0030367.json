Steve Smith gestures for a DRS decision. Source: AFP \nIndian captain Virat Kohli reacted angrily on field, and didn’t hold back in the press conference that time — though notably stopped short of calling Smith a cheat. \nInstead he simply strongly inferred it. \n“There’s a line that you don’t cross on the cricket field, sledging and playing against the opponents is different,” Kohli said after India’s victory in Bengaluru. \n“I don’t want to mention the word, but it falls into that bracket. \n“I would never do something like that on the cricket field.” \nWhen asked if the word he was referring to was “cheating”, Kohli replied: “I didn’t say that, you did”. \nThe fallout was vicious, with the boards of both teams coming out swinging in defence of their captains. \nThe fourth Test has endured far less controversy, but it was reignited late on day three as Australia’s chances of victory continued to fade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T14:54:00.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
