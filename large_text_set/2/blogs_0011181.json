But sometimes divers venture outside the cage, taking these encounters to the extreme. \nSuch was the case with German diver Martin Kochling, who not only swam with great white sharks he reached out and touched them. \nBelgium photographer Jean-Marie Ghislain captured the close encounter in captivating photographs, though we are uncertain whether he was outside the cage as well. Martin Kochling touched a female great white shark and a male. Photo: Courtesy of Jean-Marie Ghislain/Caters News Martin Kochling appeared fearless during the encounter with two great white sharks.

The younger male was quite territorial and aggressive, but if you were an experienced diver you could manage him.” Guadalupe Island is the mecca for great white sharks.

Could there be such a thing? \nIf so then this encounter was one of those times, and Ghislain was happy to document it. Presumably it was sometime during the last diving season at Guadalupe Island, the mecca for great white sharks. \n“It’s good to show you can have a peaceful encounter with a great white,”Ghislain said. “They have such great personalities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:56:20.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
