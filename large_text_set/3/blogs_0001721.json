But Wellington is pretty nice, being surrounded by cool mountains AND it's the craft beer capital of the country, in which hipsters abound.\nIf you're interested, just create a profile on the LookSee website . Then, Wellington employers will nominate their chosen candidates, and those with the highest number of nominations will be selected to fly to Wellington.\nSo sure, it seems like a resumé competition, but if you win, you get to live in the best little city ever!
