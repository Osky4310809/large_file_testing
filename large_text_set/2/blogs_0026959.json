He said after he stopped shaking the child, he tripped, causing the baby to strike a corner table. \nLeer told officers he set the baby down on the floor, where she continued to cry for a few minutes before becoming unresponsive. \nThat is when he reportedly called the child’s mother and then 911. \nOn Feb. 23, 2017, the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office ruled that the infant died “as the result of a blunt force head injury,” and her manner of death was listed as homicide. \nOn Monday, Pennsylvania State Police announced that the 23-year-old man would be charged with homicide, in addition to aggravated assault, aggravated assault on a child under age 13, simple assault, endangering the welfare of children and reckless endangering. \nNeighbors say they are surprised the hear of the allegations. \n“He was a nice kid. Seemed like a very nice kid, never caused any problems,” said neighbor Glenn Klink. “It’s a shame, he seemed like a generally nice kid. Never would have dreamed this happened.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:02:21.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
