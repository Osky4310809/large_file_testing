Add 10,000 from Wal-Mart. \"Thousands\" for Hyundai. And Bayer said it would keep 9,000 jobs and add 3,000. That is, if the government gives it the regulatory approval to merge with Monsanto. \nAmazon didn't mention Trump in its press release announcing 100,000 U.S. jobs, mostly in fulfillment warehouses, but CEO Jeff Bezos attended a meeting of the tech titans at Trump Tower with the president-elect just before Christmas. \nRelated: Trump Summons Tech Titans to Trump Tower \n\"Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet,\" Kristin Dziczek, a spokeswoman for the Center for Automotive Research told the Guardian . \"Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with.\" \nThey join a small but growing list of companies with recent job creation or preservation announcements tied either explicitly or implicitly to the PEOTUS, including Amazon, Carrier, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, and Sprint. Not So Fast \nBut peel back a layer and the promises come with some caveats. A company's plan to increase capital expenditures, which include jobs and facility improvements, are typically years in the making. Some of these \"announcements\" are old news in a new hat. \nGM said its plan was approved before the election, but told Bloomberg it was \"accelerated\" under pressure from Trump, for example. \nRelated: GM's Newly Announced $1B Investment Plans Likely Date Back to 2014 \nWal-Mart's job creation plans are in line with its normal annual increase, and come after it has closed 269 under-performing stores and cut thousands of jobs. \nAnd Sprint's jobs were part of a previously announced commitment by its parent company to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. \n\"This is the normal course of business,\" independent auto industry consultant Maryann Keller told Bloomberg of the moves by GM and other automakers. \"All they're doing is announcing investments that they would have made anyway.\" Ben Popken", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:05:59.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
