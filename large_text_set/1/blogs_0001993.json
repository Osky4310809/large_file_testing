After a tough 2016 , we're hungry for some hope. And even if turning a fresh calendar page is a placebo effect of sorts, the burst of positive energy has put some fuel back in our depleted tanks. \nThe coming year will still hold plenty of curveballs, but TBH, the stars look a lot smoother than they did last year, even starting with January's forecast. \nAs always, January begins with the sun in structured, steadying Capricorn — the perfect time to set #goals and map out some lofty milestones . Aim for a combination of spiritual and ambitious resolutions. Go-getter Mars and dreamy Neptune will unite in Pisces on January 1, a rare conjunction that will ramp up our manifesting powers. Your planetary prescription: one part Law of Attraction, one part hustle. \nMercury will also be rounding out its retrograde that started December 19, continuing to scramble signals with communication, technology and travel until January 8. Mercury is reversing through Capricorn until the 4th, then it will back into outspoken Sagittarius. Filters, please! We could all come down with a case of foot-in-mouth disease during the first week of the month. \nThe year's first full moon arrives January 12 in caring Cancer. While this might be an occasion for domestic bliss, la luna is snared in a Grand Cross —a four-way showdown—with a hotheaded triumvirate: the ego-driven sun, disruptor Uranus, and outspoken Jupiter. We could feel pulled in way too many directions now, or we might experience some upheaval in global politics once again. Of course, that's become business as usual…but be prepared for some tension in the air now. ADVERTISEMENT \nAquarius season begins on January 19, just in time for Inauguration Day (aaa !) on January 20 and the Women's March on Washington on January 21. Aquarius is the sign of group activities, humanitarian endeavors, politics, and activism—so the time is ripe for raising our collective voices. \nOr maybe we should just crow? On January 27 the Aquarius new moon also brings us the Chinese New Year—and the start of the Year of the Fire Rooster . Wave goodbye to the manic Monkey , whose screeching and mischievous antics have grown tiresome to many. Now, the fastidious Rooster is here to sound the alarm and help us all get #woke. There's work to do, people—and the Rooster is here to help us chart the way. \nWant more insight into what the year has in store for you?
