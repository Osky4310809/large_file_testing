According to its investigation results, faulty batteries were the cause of the phablet catching fire and even exploding in some cases. The South Korean smartphone giant faced huge losses due to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, and the company is now trying to minimize those losses. If a new report is to be believed, Samsung might start selling refurbished Galaxy Note 7 with a lower capacity 3200 mAh battery in some markets. \nAccording to a report from Hankyung.com , Samsung might start selling refurbished Galaxy Note 7 units with 3000 ~ 3200 mAh batteries (smaller than 3500 mAh batteries in the original Galaxy Note 7) in emerging markets like India and Vietnam starting June 2017. The refurbished device is also said to have a new case, so its design might be slightly different compared to the original model. Except for the battery, all the other internals components such as the processor, memory, storage, camera, and other things are said to be exactly similar to the original device. \nSamsung has reportedly recovered almost 98 percent of the 3.06 million Galaxy Note 7 units it sold worldwide. Selling a refurbished variant of the Galaxy Note 7 will provide Samsung not only a way to recover some losses but also a safe way to solve the environmental issue related to disposing of electronic components. Even if this report turns out to be true, it doesnâ€™t mention the number of refurbished Galaxy Note 7 units Samsung would sell, and if its pricing could be lower this time around. Would you buy a refurbished Galaxy Note 7 if Samsung starts selling it?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:01:44.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
