Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports \nLaVar Ball recently said that he would have “killed” Michael Jordan in a game of one-on-one during his heyday. \nWhile this claim was ridiculous, we didn’t know much about Ball’s hoop skills other than the fact that he averaged 2.2 points per game at Washington State during the 1987-88 season. That same season Jordan averaged 35 points per game for the Chicago Bulls and won his first NBA MVP award. \nSo, the cards already weren’t in Ball’s favor. And then The Charlotte Observer unearthed a video of Ball playing at a Chino Hills, Calif., rec league, and his game isn’t nearly as polished as he described. \nBall is No. 8 on the red team and he appears to struggle in a variety of areas on the hardwood. \nIt is important to note, however, that the video is edited together, and could have just left out any good plays that Ball might have made. \nStill, it’s even harder to imagine Ball giving His Airness a game, let alone dominating him the way that he claimed. \nThis article first appeared on NESN.com and was syndicated with permission.
