Deirdre Minogue was in the lovely position of being able to add on the house next door. Deirdre outside her home. Dating over 100 years, it was part of a row of stone cottages which originally housed workers at the Fitzwilliam Estate The boxing hares made from willow were created by Lynn Kirkham. They are situated in the JUB - the joined-up bit Deirdre is thrilled with her new Ikea kitchen units and Belfast sink Deirdre recently created this airy, roomy space by removing the bedroom above and opening the whole area up to the roof. Most of the pottery lining the shelves is handpainted by Deirdre. The mantlepiece came from a dump in Scotland. She called this cat Neeps in honour of their Scottish ties The guest bedroom is imbued with colour and pattern. The bed is covered with an Indian quilt, the wall hanging is an old piece of Chinese embroidery and the beaded bag is by Deborah Von Metzradt, a Wicklow-based craftsperson Each house for the estate workers came complete with a sizeable plot so that the tenants would be largely self-sufficient. The dining room is simply furnished in cream. The corner cabinet is made largely of a door that Ian found in a dump Deirdre had the bathroom extended and the bath, which was already in the house, re-enamelled The living room is in the adjoining cottage. Deirdre had the plaster taken off the walls and the beams exposed to give a more rustic look. She added the stove and the bookshelves", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:51:41.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
