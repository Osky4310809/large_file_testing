Jayson Castro was crucial down the stretch for TNT KaTropa to pull out the victory. Photo by Czaesar Dancel/Rappler MANILA, Philippines - Veterans Jayson Castro and Ranidel de Ocampo combined for 36 as the TNT KaTropa held off the San Miguel Beermen, 101-94 in Game 5 of the 2017 PBA Philippine Cup semifinals on Thursday, February 16 at the Smart-Araneta Coliseum. Down by double digits at the half, the defending champs rallied to make a 16-point swing as back-to-back triples from Marcio Lassiter and Alex Cabagnot gave SMB a 60-57 lead early in the third quarter. TNT relied on their veteransâ€™ efficient second half production, as Jayson Castro finished with a game-high 18 points to go with 7 assists. Chris Ross and Junemar Fajardo had the chance to cut a 5-point deficit as TNT gained penalty with under 4 mins left in the match, but both missed crucial free throws. The KaTropa, who shot 48% from the field, bounced back from a an 11-point game 4 loss to clinch a twice-to-beat advantage heading into game 6. Game 6 of this series is on Saturday, February 18 at the Mall of Asia Arena.
