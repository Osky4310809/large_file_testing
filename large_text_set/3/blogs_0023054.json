By http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/promo_225/public/media/kendrick-lamar-2016-amas-live-billboard-1548.jpg \nJeff Kravitz/AMA2016/FilmMagic \nKendrick Lamar performs at the 2016 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on Nov. 20, 2016 in Los Angeles. \nEarly Thursday morning (March 23), Kendrick Lamar put the rap game on notice after he mysteriously posted the Roman numeral “IV” on his Instagram . He also wiped his Instagram account clean with his “IV” post the only image on his feed. \nThe Compton rapper has dropped several nuggets in recent months indicating his desire to release a new project. Earlier this month in an interview with T: The New York Times Style magazine , Lamar spoke on his mental state for his forthcoming LP. \n“I think now, how wayward things have gone within the past few months, my focus is ultimately going back to my community and the other communities around the world where they’re doing the groundwork,” he said. \nA new full-length endeavor would mark his first album since his masterful 2015 release To Pimp a Butterfly . “ To Pimp a Butterfly was addressing the problem. I’m in a space now where I’m not addressing the problem anymore,” he said before adding, “We’re in a time where we exclude one major component out of this whole thing called life: God.” \nTo Pimp a Butterfly earned numerous accolades including 2016 Grammys for best rap album and best rap performance for his single “Alright.” It also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 . \nBillboard has reached out to Kendrick Lamar’s rep for comment. \nTake a look at his cryptic Instagram post below.
