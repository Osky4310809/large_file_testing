The pair were in attendance for the weekend win over Swansea and are looking to join him in London, when her school year ends. \nHis contract at Stamford Bridge has two years to run, and Inter would have to pay a big compensation package to land Conte. \nYet under the ownership of the Suning Group - who also bankroll Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning - money is available as the Inter hierarchy look to challenge for the Scudetto, having struggled to keep pace with rivals Juve in recent years.
