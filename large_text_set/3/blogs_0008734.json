It may seem like it's time to get rid of your favourite make-up, but don't be so quick to dump them (unless they're past their expiry date, then dump it immediately). You can actually get more out of your old make-up than you think, with the help of a few easy hacks. So give these four simple solutions a try, before you think about throwing your make-up away. Use saline solution, or contact lens solution, to revive old, clumpy mascara \nThe next time you're thinking about throwing out your dry, clumpy mascara, give it a second chance. Add a few drops of saline solution or contact lens solution to the tube, and use your mascara wand to mix it around. Voila, you'll have good-as-new mascara at your disposal. Use your almost finished coloured powder products, along with Vaseline or lip salve, to make a brand new custom lipstick shade \nIf you're almost out of your favourite eye shadow or blush, don't just throw away the last of it. Instead, mix what is remaining of the powder with Vaseline or a colourless lip salve to make your own custom lip colour. Rub your old make-up brushes with oil before washing them, to get rid of dry bristles and clumps \nIf you have stiff make-up brushes, that are currently not too conducive to usage, rub them with some oil (coconut or olive oil would work), until they feel less brittle, and then wash them like you normally would. They will be softer, and much easier to use, after. Use rubbing alcohol and cling film to repair old, broken compacts and palettes \nHaving a broken or cracked compact or make-up palette is heart-breaking. But before your throw it away, give it a new lease of life with this brilliant hack. Take the broken product and cover it with a cling film (and while this may break your heart more), crush and break it some more till it is no longer a solid mass. Then, add a little bit of rubbing alcohol, mix it with the product, smoothen the surface and then leave it to dry. Soon enough, you'll be left with a crack-free make-up product, ready to be used again.
