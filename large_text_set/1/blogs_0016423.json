Since then, the song has gone on to be a hit, touching nearly 10 million views. Kangana moved effortlessly to the beats, but shooting the song wasn’t as easy as it looks! The makers released a behind the scene video of the song, where we see a lot of hard work and practice being put into Bloody Hell . Kangana had to work really hard for this song and we have to applaud her for it. \nIf you have seen the song, you know Kangana has performed a lot of different dance forms including ballet. She has done flips and stunts in the song too. But while the prep was tough, there were other factors like cheetahs and snakes that Kangana had to brave during the song too. And she still managed to put up a sizzling act. Commendable to say the least. In the latest promo, we even see Vishal instructing the crew about the plan to shoot the song. Kangana later reveals about Shahid Kapoor ‘s superiority in dancing, as she mentions, “My training started with Kalaripayattu and ballet and these really amazing flips. I was breaking bones, but while I was doing my mathematical equation with the Bloody Hell signature step, Shahid just got up and started doing the step. He did the step without even learning it. That’s the moment when I realised that I wasn’t a good dancer.” ALSO READ – Rangoon song Bloody Hell: Kangana Ranaut is a total DIVA in this unusually entertaining track \nDirected by Vishal Bhardwaj, Rangoon is a period drama with a backdrop of World War II.
