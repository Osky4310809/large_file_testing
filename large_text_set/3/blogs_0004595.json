I think they are projecting something that they really would like to say about their own situation. Really, I think they should use a fictional US President,” Abella, in an apparent dig at President Donald Trump, said in a Palace briefing, \nAsked if Malacañang finds the portrayal “insulting,” the Palace official said, “Well, they engage in something that they would like to…It’s their business, it’s their craft. You cannot deny them their craft—their taste perhaps.” IDL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:23:57.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
