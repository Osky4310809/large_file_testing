The sign above translates to \"Make good choices.\" (CBC) Related Stories The Public Schools Act (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) \nDozens of parents are pushing back against a French school in Winnipeg they say should get with the times and not be allowed to offer Catholic coursework during school hours. \n\"I think we're on the right side of history with this,\" said Nicole Rosen, a University of Manitoba linguistics professor and mother of two students at École Christine-Lespérance in South St. Vital. \n\"We know that the face of French Manitoba has changed a lot over the years, and we'd like the school's programming to reflect that diversity.\" \nSmudging in public schools: Reconciliation or religious act? \nÉcole Christine-Lespérance and 24 schools are part of the provincially regulated Franco-Manitoban School Division (DSFM). \nThe school is currently offering an optional catechism course. Rosen and other parents disapprove and have started a petition against allowing the course to be held during school hours. \nAs of late last week, Rosen said well over 100 people had signed the petition. \n\"We believe that the religious instruction offered in schools during the school day is not compatible with the Franco-Manitoban School Division's commitment to promote an inclusive policy and practice,\" reads an English translation of the French petition. \"We then ask that religious classes be offered outside of school hours to eliminate exclusion in our schools.\" Nicole Rosen is a professor at the University of Manitoba and parent to two kids who attend École Christine-Lespérance in Winnipeg. (CBC) \nBut Bernard Lesage, board chairperson for the division, said no one is forcing students at the school to take the Catholic course, and neither the division nor École Christine-Lespérance are playing favourites with the Catholic faith. 'Not imposing' Catholicism \n\"We're not imposing any religious exercise,\" he said. \nCurrently the 45-minute religious instruction at École Christine-Lespérance takes up the last 30 minutes of class before lunch and extends 15 minutes into the noon hour. 'We absolutely want people to have access to these catechism classes, it's an important traditional part of French-Canadian identity, but we don't want to have one group that's privileged over top of the other group.' - Nicole Rosen \nGenerally speaking, students in the DSFM who don't wish to participate in catechism can opt out or attend \"classe de morales\" where they learn about \"basic moral guidelines\" like respect, Lesage said. \nÉcole Christine-Lespérance also offers students the opportunity to use the time for fitness activities, Lesage added. \nBecause the division falls is under provincial jurisdiction, it must abide by provincial rules. That includes following legislation passed in the late 1800s that mandates the division offer religious schooling if enough parents express interest in such classes, Lesage said. \nUnder the Public Schools Act , public schools may offer religious instruction if a minimum of 25 parents, or the parents of at least 10 children, request such coursework. Other religions eligible \nThe division would follow suit with the creation of a course on any other religion if the demand and minimum requirements were there, Lesage said. 'If parents would want Islam taught and they do their survey and have the percentages needed to have it, we would follow our own bylaw and do the same thing.' - Bernard Lesage \n\"We're not favouring any religion. The same would apply to be it Islam or Judaism. The same criteria would apply,\" he said. \n\"If parents would want Islam taught and they do their survey and have the percentages needed to have it, we would follow our own bylaw and do the same thing.\" \nOffering the religious instruction during school hours is also ultimately at the discretion of school principals, Lesage added. \nRosen said thus far the only voices that have been heard on the issue have been those of parents who want the course during normal school hours. \nIn the fall when there was a push for the instruction to happen after school, some parents complained that it conflicted with bus schedules and caused issues getting their kids home, or otherwise cut into the students' down time. Privilege concerns \nRosen said continuing to offer religious instruction in the school flies in the face of the division's most recent strategic plan, which values inclusive programming. \nIn addition to diversity in the student body, there are some parents who are anglophone, can't speak French or don't identify with the Catholic faith, Rosen said. \n\"There are Muslims, there are Jews, there are atheists, there are people with all sorts of backgrounds, and we'd like to see the programming reflect that,\" she said. \n\"We think it's quite reasonable to expect that these classes be held outside of class hours. We absolutely want people to have access to these catechism classes, it's an important traditional part of French-Canadian identity, but we don't want to have one group that's privileged over top of the other group.\" \nLesage anticipates the issue will come up at the next school division meeting on March 22.
