Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the cauliflower florets and chickpeas on the baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and lemon juice, and season with the za'atar spice, salt, and pepper. Toss the vegetables and chickpeas to coat. Slide the baking sheet into the oven, and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, tossing the vegetables and chickpeas frequently. The chickpeas should be crisp and the cauliflower quite browned. While the vegetables are roasting, make the Green Tahini: In a blender, combine the tahini, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, filtered water, agave syrup, basil, green onions, garlic, salt, and pepper. Blend on high until it has a smooth, creamy texture. Add more filtered water if needed to make the dressing pourable. Check the seasonings and adjust if necessary. Portion into 5 equal parts, then store four in the fridge and serve the last one hot with the Green Tahini drizzled over top and some fresh lemon wedges on the side, if you like. Your Week of Meals DAY 2: Cauliflower rice and grilled tofu bowl \nTake the cooled roasted cauliflower and chickpeas and pulse them in the food processor to form \"rice.\" Quickly brush a piece of organic, extra-firm tofu with tamari, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Grill or roast the tofu until caramelized and brown in spots. Place the tofu on top of the rice. Drizzle the bowl with the green tahini and garnish with sliced green onions. DAY 3: Creamy pasta with lemon and roasted cauliflower \nCook some brown rice pasta and, while it's still warm, toss it with the roasted cauliflower and chickpea mixture, the green tahini, garlicky olive oil, nutritional yeast, and an extra squeeze of lemon. Stir the mixture over medium heat until creamy and saucy, adding a few splashes of vegetable stock/water if necessary. Serve hot with extra sprinkles of nutritional yeast. DAY 4: Taco night! \nWarm some corn tortillas over a low flame or under the broiler. Place the roasted cauliflower and chickpeas inside of the tortillas. Top the cauliflower with sliced avocado, shaved radishes, or crunchy cabbage shreds; drizzles of the green tahini sauce; and a few drops of hot sauce. DAY 5: Garlicky cauliflower and chickpea stew \nSauté an onion and two minced garlic cloves until soft and transfer to an upright blender. Add half of the roasted cauliflower and chickpea mixture to the blender, along with all of the green tahini, and enough vegetable stock to cover by about 2 inches. Blend until smooth and fluid. Transfer the blended mixture to a pot, along with the remaining roasted cauliflower and chickpeas. Bring the stew to a boil, adding more vegetable stock if necessary. Serve hot with a sprinkling of chopped green onions and a squeeze of lemon. Liz Moody \nLiz Moody is the Senior Food Editor at mindbodygreen.
