You may soon be posed with the same dilemma that Bender faced in Three Hundred Big Boys : one 300 dollar hookerbot or 300 one dollar hookerbots?\nOne brothel in Barcelona is helping pave the way by staffing its rendezvous rooms with hyper-realistic sex dolls. You can book a little one-on-one time with their Lumidolls right now. The going rate for their services — which ostensibly includes holding a pose for extended periods of time and not making you feel inadequate about your sexual performance — is about $125 an hour.\nTo set the mood, your hosts will dress and position your Lumidoll to suit your desires. They’ll even throw on a slow jam to set the mood. If that’s not thing, each room is equipped with a big-screen TV, and they’ll light it up with the hardcore video of your choosing.\nTo be clear, these are not sexbots. They’re very well done life-sized dolls, like the RealDolls that Abyss Creations have been making for around 20 years. Sexbots are definitely coming, though. Abyss is actively working on an incredibly advanced robotic version of their trailblazing doll complete with AI. Companies in Japan have been doing similar work since at least 2014.\n\nAnother thing companies in Japan have been doing for several years: opening sex doll brothels. More recently we’ve seen robot hotels opening up, so it’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that sexbot-staffed brothels will be popping up in Japan in the very near future.\nBarcelona may very well be next, which gives you the choice of going trans-Pacific or trans-Atlantic for your first experimenting bumping uglies with a ‘bot. And remember, experts, say you probably don’t need to worry about one of them killing you .\nUntil this becomes a full-fledged reality we will have to indulge in Westworld , now streaming through Amazon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T08:43:32.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
