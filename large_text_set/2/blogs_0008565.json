Photo: Steven Siewert \nA spokeswoman for the Powerhouse said Mr Parry had not declined to attend the inquiry: \"MAAS [Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences] is aware of the requirements in relation to attendance at inquiries of this nature.\" \nThe NSW government's plan to move the Powerhouse to Parramatta and sell off its Ultimo site to developers has been contentious, with opponents claiming the move will cost up to $1 billion , result in a smaller, inferior museum and that several items in its vast collection cannot easily be moved. \nMr Borsak raised doubts in hearings last October about the proposal, questioning whether the museum's director Dolla Merrillees had the sufficient skills and experience to deliver a new museum. \nMs Merrillees told Fairfax Media last April that she had not led a major museum building project, but was \"pretty confident\" of guiding the move of the Powerhouse Museum from Ultimo to a new building in Parramatta. \"I've worked on fairly major events and projects,\" she said. \"Have I built a new museum? No. But I'm not sure how many of my profession actually have.\" \nMr Borsak also said that secrecy surrounding the proposal raised serious concerns, pointing out the site earmarked for the new museum on the Parramatta River was flood prone. \nThe NSW government claims a new Powerhouse, rebadged as the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, would be the anchor for an arts and cultural precinct in Parramatta and support economic growth in western Sydney. \nBut the proposal has been condemned by former Powerhouse trustees , museum experts, inner-city residents, the City of Sydney and the Greens. \n\"The relocation of the Powerhouse has all the look of a political con job, not a genuine attempt to do the best by either the museum sector or the public of NSW,\" said the Greens Upper House MP David Shoebridge. \nThe NSW Parliament has the power to compel witnesses to attend a hearing of a committee inquiry, with refusal raising the possibility of imprisonment. \nMr Shoebridge said it was his \"very strong preference\" that the witnesses appear voluntarily on Friday. \nBut Mr Shoebridge, who is the inquiry's deputy chairman but speaking in his capacity as MP, said: \"Of course a parliamentary committee that's worth its salt should be willing to subpoena them\". \n\"The government has hidden behind cabinet-in-confidence to try and avoid the truth coming out. \n\"Hopefully the inquiry will have witnesses who can cut through that nonsense.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:04:16.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
