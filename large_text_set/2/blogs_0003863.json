Gausman asked for $3.55 million and the O’s filed at $3.15 million.\nThe Royals planned to take a similar route with Kelvin Herrera. The right-handed reliever filed at $5.6 million and the club countered at $5.05 million. The sides settled at $5.325 million, the halfway point.\nAccording to general manager Brian Cashman, what other clubs did doesn’t influence Betances’ case.\n“Nothing has changed, we haven’t talked,’’ Cashman said Monday. “We have no intention of talking. It’s not close. Somebody else will make the decision.’’\nBrian Cashman Bill Kostroun It will be the first time since 2008 the Yankees will go to an arbitration hearing. Then it was with Chien-Ming Wang. After making $489,500 in 2007, when he posted a second straight 19-win season and lost twice to the Indians in the postseason, Wang requested $4.6 million and the Yankees filed at $4 million and won.\nBetances has been an All-Star the past three seasons and leads all relievers with 392 strikeouts in that span. Betances, who turns 29 in March, plans on attending the hearing.\nIn 73 appearances last season, Betances was 3-6 with a 3.08 ERA and fanned 126 in 73 innings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:36:34.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
