Previous rumors had suggested the device would boast a curved display, but the recent TrendForce report suggested that won’t be the case after all. \nIn the same report, another pair of key details were supposedly revealed: storage options and RAM. \nAccording to TrendForce, the iPhone 8 will reportedly boast 3GB of RAM. That would put it in line with the current iPhone 7 Plus, and it’s expected the upcoming 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus will also feature 3GB of RAM as well. \nAdditionally, the report also states that Apple will drop the 32GB storage option altogether when it comes to the iPhone 8. Instead, Apple will apparently launch a 64GB iPhone 8 and a 256GB iPhone 8. That would also ditch the three-tier model that Apple has stuck with for quite some time. \nRelated, the report also states that the iPhone 7s models will offer storage options up to 256GB as well, but does not indicate what other options there will be to choose from. \nThe suggestion that Apple will go with only two storage options for the iPhone 8 means that Apple could price it at $999, if it lines up with previous rumors that have said Apple’s flagship 2017 iPhone will start at $1,000 , and could be priced even higher. The 256GB iPhone 8 may well cost $1,100, for instance. \nAs it stands, the iPhone 8 is rumored to feature quite a bit of noteworthy additions. If Apple sticks to this pricing, but packs in all of these specs and features, will you fork over the cash?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:54:16.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
