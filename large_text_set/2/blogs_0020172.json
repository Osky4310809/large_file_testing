This year, the Korean tech giant has upgraded the phone with the same name and it is now called LG K10 (2017). The most important new addition to the K10 (2017) is the fact that LG has tied in the 112 emergency number directly in the smartphone and makes it easy to access. Essentially, there is a direct access to a panic button on the home screen, or you can press the power key thrice to directly make an emergency call. You can also long press the power button and select 112 emergency call from the menu displayed on the screen. Now that that is out of the way, let’s take a look at the phone itself. \nThe LG K10 (2017) has a 5.3-inch 720p IPS display, which LG claims that it can output 100% of the RGB colour gamut. While we can’t test that claim just yet, what we can tell you is that 720p on a smartphone that costs Rs 13,999 feels like a letdown. Having said that, the display itself is not too bad actually. It looked vibrant and bright in the limited time we had with the phone. Furthermore, the display is protected by a 2.5D curved glass. The back is curved too. Basically, LG has carried forward the pebble design language from the previous K10. It feels nice to hold in the hand actually. Furthermore, the rear cover is removable and the 2,800mAh battery can be dislodged too. On the rear, below the display, you get the Home button with an integrated fingerprint sensor. \nThe best thing about the K10 (2017) is the fact that it runs Android Nougat out of the box. This definitely gives the phone and edge over the competition. But, do note that LG’s skin is very heavy and lacks an app drawer. We are fairly confident that you can bring back the app drawer from the settings menu. One thing that annoyed us is that LG bundles way too many first-party and third-party bloatware with the phone. \nInternally, the phone comes with an octa-core MediaTek 6750 SoC clocked at 1.5GHz. You only get 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, though. Thankfully, LG has provided a memory card slot which can be used to expand the storage up to 2TB. There is a 13MP camera on the rear with a single LED flash and on the front you get a 5MP camera. You can take wide-angle selfies with it, for what it is worth. We couldn’t test the camera’s performance in the short time with the device. However, we did note that the focussing speeds were pretty decent. The K10 (2017) also supports USB OTG with support for charging other smartphones. However, we really don’t see the reason why anyone would want to use the juice from the fairly small 2,800mAh battery inside the K10 (2017) to charge any other phone. \nThe K10 (2017) has a few things going for it, but overall we think that it goes up against some really tough competition from some fairly competent phones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( review ), Honor 6X ( review ), Coolpad Cool 1 Dual ( review ), and even the recently discounted Lenovo Z2 Plus ( review ). Keep watching this space for the full review of the phone and our final verdict.
