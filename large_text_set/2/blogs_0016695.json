PUBLISHED: 11:05, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:47, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 \nEx-European Council president Herman Van Rompuy insisted even negotiating Britain’s divorce from the bloc will be a “Herculean task” and two years to complete Brexit will “not nearly be enough”. \nMr Van Rompuy, famously compared to a “damp rag” by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, claimed Britain had “lost friends” across Europe. \nRevealing his expectation the UK will formally leave the EU in 2019 without a free trade deal - and with only “informal talks” on the basis of a new relationship having taken place - the former Belgian prime minister suggested a transitional arrangement for Britain beyond Brexit would be merely the “phasing out” of its EU membership. \nHe also dismissed talk of Britain being able to sign free trade agreements with non-EU countries on its departure day.

No one knows how long but two years will not nearly be enough. There are no precedents. \n“There is no such thing as a soft negotiation, certainly not on a ‘hard’ Brexit. Every partner will defend its interests. \n“In the separation negotiation the UK and the EU27 will discuss the legacy costs of the exit even before a free trade agreement can be put on the table. \n“The bill cannot be used as a bargaining chip in order to get a better trade deal. The purpose shouldn’t be to punish Britain and the EU27 cannot reward the leaver either. \n“It takes two to tango.” \nHe added: “We will not be ready for our future relationship when the UK leaves, just ahead of the European elections of June 2019. \n“The transitional arrangement will not be about the phasing in or implementing of a non-existent trade deal. \n“In reality it will rather be a phasing out after [the UK] having left the EU and Single Market without a free trade agreement. \n“The UK has to acknowledge that Brexit is not high on the political agenda on each of the 27 remaining member states. \n“A lot of the countries are focussed on their national elections. But even in normal times Brexit comes after jobs, migration, terrorism, taxes on the priority list of national leaders.” The UK has to acknowledge that Brexit is not high on the political agenda on each of the 27 remaining member states. Herman Van Rompuy \nMr Van Rompuy described the election of US President Donald Trump as a “bigger concern for the EU citizens than Brexit”. \nDespite admitting the EU would seek a “special relationship” with Britain on areas such as security, research and development, migration and combating terrorism, Mr Van Rompuy claimed discussions on these areas would follow behind initial divorce talks and then later trade negotiations. \nHe said: “We can only think about a more comprehensive relationship when we have agreed on trade and there’s a long way to go. \n“The remaining 18 months after the triggering of Article 50 and the following European Council will mainly be devoted to the separation treaty. \n“We can have at the same time informal talks about the outlines of a free trade agreement. But in my view real sectoral negotiations will only start after the UK has left.” Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain.

And you need many Indias… to replace the union.” Related articles Sturgeon told ‘NOcircumstances’ where Scotland can remain in EU \nThe former Brussels bureaucrat claimed both the EU and the UK needed to work to “restore trust” lost during the Brexit referendum campaign, as he appeared to take aim at Theresa May’s suggestion she could slash business taxes to undercut the EU if no Brexit deal is agreed. \nMr Van Rompuy said: “Threats are not impressive or impressing nobody but many can be shocked.” \nHe also insisted the remaining EU member states would remain united in the face of “external threats” such as Brexit, the election of President Trump and the activities of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. \nClaiming “Brexit is not the template for further exits” from the EU by other member states, he urged EU leader to not “waste” the opportunity to push forward with greater integration over the next few years.
