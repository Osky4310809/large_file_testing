It does this by constantly checking that all installed apps have the latest available versions. With Google Play Services, you can authenticate Google services, synchronize your contacts, access the latest user privacy settings, and use higher quality location-based services that use less energy. Besides all this, Google Play Services enhances the overall experience of using your device. It lets you search for things offline, provides you with more immersive maps, and improves the gaming experience by optimizing RAM. Other menu options within Google Play Services let you manage all your apps (not necessarily the ones you have installed), establish location settings, and even manage your Google Fit account. Google Play Services is an essential app for any device with an Android operating system. Without it, many other apps could start having problems.
