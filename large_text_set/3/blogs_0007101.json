It was a financial decision that saves the team about $6 million in cap space, despite being a difficult call to make. \nCharles is now a free agent and can sign with any team he’d like, and there’s one team out there that makes a lot of sense for him. The Philadelphia Eagles could use a running back to spark their ground game, and their head coach just happens to be someone who spent several years coaching Charles. \nDoug Pederson, former offensive coordinator of the Chiefs, confirmed Wednesday that the Eagles will explore the possibility of bringing in Charles. “I’ve got history with him in Kansas City for three years. I think he’s a tremendous running back,” he said during his press conference. “It’s something we’ll evaluate now. We’ll grade him just like we do every free agent and every person who’s released and see where he can fit in our offense.” \nPederson also confirmed that Darren Sproles will be back in 2017, reassuming his role as a third-down back and return man. He doesn’t solve the problem Philadelphia has on first and second down, though. \nRyan Mathews hasn’t panned out the way they had hoped he would, struggling to stay healthy and atop the depth chart. Charles has dealt with similar issues, but when healthy, he’s one of the best backs in the game. \nIf the Eagles can get him to sign a team-friendly deal, it could be a match made in heaven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:17:05.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
