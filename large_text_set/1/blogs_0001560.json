Presidential inaugurations are a locus of that generic form of faith. \nThat's why a president-elect's choice of clerics to say prayers at the inauguration is watched carefully. An incoming head of state can use the selection to send signals and set a new ideological and moral tone. The new incumbent can reward spiritual figures, and constituencies, who have served as political allies, and offer an olive branch to religious and social groups that view the election result with dismay. The latter tactic is a risky one. When, in 2009, Barack Obama offered a slot to Rick Warren, a preacher and best-selling author with conservative views on homosexuality, both men drew opprobrium from their respective constituencies. \nIn some ways, the choice was even harder for Donald Trump, a religiously illiterate figure who nonetheless won the votes of many religious people. To pray, speak or read scriptural verses at his big day on January 20th he has chosen six individuals, all of whom carry a certain edginess. Among them is his personal spiritual adviser Paula White, a Florida televangelist of the Pentecostal kind who urges followers to make generous contributions to the church and expect material bounty in return. Then there is Wayne T. Jackson, an African-American pastor from Detroit with a similar penchant for the prosperity gospel. He helped Mr Trump attract at least a few black votes by conducting a sympathetic interview with the candidate, and firmly believes the incoming president's wealth is a sign of divine blessing. \nAnother chosen speaker, Samuel Rodriguez is a leading figure among Hispanic evangelicals, a growing constituency which leans more to the right than Catholic Latinos do. Rabbi Marvin Tier will be the first Jewish participant in the ceremony since 1985; he runs the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles which has just denounced a UN vote critical of Israel, which America declined to block, as the most egregious anti-Semitic act of 2016. \nBut the two highest-profile figures on Mr Trump's list are Franklin Graham, who is probably America's best-known evangelical preacher, and Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the champion of Catholicism in New York. Mr Graham is no stranger to high places; his emphatically Christian supplication at the inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001 prompted a law-suit from a secularist campaigner called Michael Newdow who believes that public references to God violate the constitution. \nMr Graham went on to embarrass the younger President Bush by saying, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, that Islam was a \"very evil and wicked religion\"; at the time the administration was rallying a broad coalition, including Muslim countries, to a \"war against terror\" and it was stressing that it had no quarrel with Islam as such. On the face of things, Mr Graham's harsh views on Islam, and in particular his belief in curbing Muslim immigration, might sit more easily with the new president; but nobody should be surprised if at some point in the future Mr Trump is left uncomfortable by one of Mr Graham's rambunctious outbursts. \nWith Cardinal Dolan, meanwhile, immigration more likely than any other issue to be a point of friction with the incoming head of state. The Catholic prelate will be happy to see the White House occupied by a man who holds (as of recently, anyway) conservative views on bioethical issues, especially abortion. But the cardinal follows the church's line in advocating a liberal and humane immigration policy, and in deploring selfish \"nativism\" among Americans whose recent forebears were members of struggling ethnic minorities. On that issue, he and the White House will part company. \nMr Trump's spiritual supporters may be carefully chosen, and for the most part they seem to be honoured by the invitation, but he should not count on their unconditional loyalty. If religion is worth the name, it has a propensity for slipping out of any earthly leader's control.
