According to NASA's announcement today , the ultimate goal of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission is to learn more about the gravitational, electric and magnetic fields at the edges of these cosmic phenomena.\nThe IXPE works as its name suggests: superheated gases around black holes become polarized and vibrate in a particular direction, so the IXPE gets a look at the invisible by measuring the polarization of those X-rays.\n\"We cannot directly image what's going on near objects like black holes and neutron stars,\" Paul Hertz, a director with NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington said, \"but studying the polarization of X-rays emitted from their surrounding environments reveals the physics of these enigmatic objects.\"\nThe IXPE mission will launch in 2020, and NASA expects it to cost $188 million including the cost of the launch vehicle, which is being provided by Colorado-based Ball Aerospace. The Italian Space Agency also contributed the Italian-made polarization sensitive X-ray detectors. The mission itself came from NASA's Astrophysics Explorer's Program , which accepts outside proposals for new missions and has led to breakthroughs in the study of everything from Earth's atmosphere to cosmic background radiation.", "external_links": ["http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/", "https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-mission-to-study-black-holes-cosmic-x-ray-mysteries"], "published": "2017-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T12:27:10.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
