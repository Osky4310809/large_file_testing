'Cut IS off' \nThe Pentagon said US aircraft had dropped allied Syrian rebel infantry forces near Tabqa, 45km (28 miles) west of Raqqa, on the Euphrates River. \nIt said the aim was to seize the dam, which provides regional electricity. There is also a military airfield and a prison holding IS hostages there. \nSpokesman Eric Pohan would not say how many US personnel were involved, but told the Associated Press that no American troops were engaged in front-line fighting. \nHe said the dam was \"significant as a strategic target'' whose capture would \"basically cut IS off'' from western approaches to Raqqa city. \nThe US allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said their fighters had seized four villages south of the Euphrates. The aim was both to capture Tabqa and to curb advances by Syrian government advances in the area. \nMeanwhile, Mr Tillerson told the coalition that the US was \"ready to grow stronger and stay aggressive in this battle\" against so-called Islamic State. \nIt was the \"policy of the US to demolish and destroy this barbaric terrorist organisation\", he said. \nMr Tillerson told the summit that the coalition should be encouraged by the progress it was making. \nHe said the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq was down by 90% over the past year. \n\"It is harder for terrorists to get in and more importantly harder for them to get out to threaten our homelands,\" Mr Tillerson said.
