\nZlatan Ibrahimovic is 35, and hand delivering trophies to Manchester United. \nIf you’re struggling for superlatives for the giant Swede in his first season in England, just compare his impact to that of the club’s captain, his fading contemporary who has been usurped as the club’s talisman by a player who had not ever played in the PL before arriving to take England by storm. \n“When you’re a manager and you join a new club you need that one person who sings out of your hymn sheet and I think Zlatan is that leader,” United legend Phil Neville said. \n“I know Rooney lifted the cup but I think Zlatan is the leader on the pitch.” \nImagine if the others had hit the ground running like he has. \nPaul Pogba is the world record fee, but as Mourinho said after the game of his striker – “he was the difference” – Ibrahimovic has been their world-beater. 'I came, that's special' 1:16 \nNow, he can add the EFL Cup to a streak that has seen him taste silverware at least once a season since 2001, no matter where he has been. \n“This is what I came for,” he said after the win. \n“I came to win and I am winning. I just have to keep going, but the more I win the more satisfied I get. \n“You appreciate it more the older you get. In the beginning it is more like fun, you don’t realise what a trophy means. \n“The older I get, the more mature I get, the more I am surrounded by a winning mentality. It is all about winning those trophies. This is what I am doing. Wherever I have gone I have won. \n“This is what I predicted. Everything I thought would happen has. I think the other ones didn’t see it. When I came here to show them what I saw apparently to many I could not do it. \n“I keep doing what I am doing ever year. I’m enjoying the game. The only thing is I am enjoying it in England.” Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

French Cup (2014–15, 2015–16), French League Cup (2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16). French Community Shield (2013, 2014, 2015) \nManchester United (2): FA Community Shield (2016), EFL Cup (2016-17) \nTHE CONTEXT: IBRA v HIS FELLOW GOLDEN OLDIES \nHe isn’t just winning trophies in winning teams; he is winning games for those sides – a trait he demonstrated immediately in the Community Shield against Leicester back in August and has continued ever since. \nHis quality was undoubted, but there were doubts on his durability, given he was arriving in the PL at 35 years of age. 'We got our trophy back!' 0:34 \nStatistics recently revealed he has actually become a better player in the second-half of his career , a point rammed home by the fact he has played more matches (37) this season than any other Premier League player. \nFor context, John Terry is 35, and being phased out at Chelsea; other PL 35-year-olds are Everton’s Gareth Barry and West Brom’s Gareth McAuley (36) while Michael Carrick is still influencing games at United - although in a more subtle fashion. \nThe most famous ‘golden oldies’ in European football today would be Roma’s Francesco Totti (40), Juventus’ Gianluigi Buffon (38) and Porto’s Iker Casillas (35). United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Source: AP \nHistorically, Ryan Giggs, who retired at 40, and Teddy Sheringham, are the benchmarks for non-goalkeeping longevity. Giggs was still winning silverware, while the latter won the Players’ Player and Football Writers Player of the Year awards in 2001 after turning 35, in a season he scored 15 goals. \nOther iconic oldies were Gary McAllister, signed by Liverpool at 35; Frank Lampard scored eight times for Manchester City in his cameo as a 36-year-old, while the oldest PL winner is Laurent Blanc, who was 37 in 2002-03. \nThat’s a mark perhaps Ibra fancies beating; there are not really many examples, of players arriving in England for the first time at that age and doing what Ibrahimovic is doing. \nTHE CRAZY IBRA NUMBERS: EVEN SCORING MORE THAN MESSI, RONALDO \nBut there’s little point comparing him to his cohort, or to previously golden oldies – because Ibra is putting himself into that other football stratosphere, the Ronaldo-Messi realm. \nHis 76 goals since the start of the 2015-2016 season, where he was at Paris Saint-Germain, is more than the fabled pair have scored in that time. Rooney's full-kit celebration 0:55 \nAny doubts about the credence of the goals scored for the Ligue 1 bully boys can now be vindicated by the fact he has done it time and time again, at pivotal moments, since taking the Premier League plunge. \nWhen Robin van Persie moved to win the PL under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012-2013, he scored 30 goals in all competitions. \nIbra already has 26 goals for Jose Mourinho’s side this season. \nHe might not win the league this season, but given he has won 13 league titles since leaving Sweden, he would fancy returning United to the top before he departs.

It’s getting to that time where talking about the best player in Premier League and he’s up there,” said Phil Neville. \n“There are times when he’s carrying united and he reminds me of Roy Keane with his aggression. He never knows when he’s beat. It’s also the quality of his finishing, he is world class and some people here didn’t think he was,” Neville added. \nOn Sky Sports, Gary Neville added: “He’s got guts, character and personality. \n“He’s filled that shirt well. It’s what the team needed and what the club needed after three years that have been tough. What a player, what an example.” Manchester United's Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic embraces Jose Mourinho. Source: AFP \nJOSE’S MOST IMPORTANT SIGNING? \nIbrahimovic is so good, Mourinho quipped that fans need to go to his house and make a stand to ensure he signs the contract extension he is stalling on. \n“I never bank for a player to sign a contract. \n“I never bank for a player to play for me. One day Zlatan decided to go to Barcelona and I was very sad and did nothing to try to stop him to go. So I don’t bank for players. \n“But, if needed, I think maybe United fans can go to the door of his house and stay there all night. If needed, I think they will go for sure. Saints robbed of opener 1:13 \n“We all want and all believe that he’s going to stay with us one more season.” \nIbrhamovic’s impact at Old Trafford is being compared to the iconic Eric Cantona – a staggering achievement given it has been barely six months, and United cannot yet edge into the top four. \nMourinho has much work to do to restore Manchester United to their best but his best piece of business will always be convincing Ibrahimovic to come on a free transfer. \nHis influence extends well beyond the pitch, as Cantona explained over the weekend. \n“He is a great player and a strong personality, he played for Milan, he played for Barcelona so he knows all the about the pressure, he understands it and he has proved that he is also a great man. Manchester United's Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Source: AFP \n“There are two kinds of older players, the ones that don’t like the young ones because they want to play and they can destroy them, and the others who will help. \n“I remember when I was 17, I played with [Andrzej] Szarmach. He was Polish, he played in two World Cup semi-finals, he was a great player and he helped me so much. I remember this and said to myself when I am older, I will try to do the same, and I’m sure Ibrahimovic does the same. \n“He is very helpful for young players because he is a great player with a strong personality, and he is the right older player who wants to help the younger ones. It’s very important to have an experienced player who gives examples to the other ones.” \nWith Ibra came the swagger, the bravado and the aura to lift a depressed Old Trafford’s spirits and capture the global imagination again. \nHe’s also bought Mourinho time to fix cracks that he’s papering over on the pitch, while becoming his ring leader in doing so.

I saw Pavel push every year until one day [approaching 37] he said stop. \n“So, it’s not a question of your physics, it’s a question of your mentality. \n“How long do you want it? It’s up to him and he knows that I will push. \n“I always told him I will squeeze him like an orange. That’s my job.” \nNot many neutral observers, or Manchester United fans, will complain about that... View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
