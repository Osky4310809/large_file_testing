Women shouted: \"Don't go! Don't go!\" \nJammeh landed in Guinea an hour later, though the country might not be his final destination. \nBarrow won the December elections, but Jammeh contested the results as calls grew for him to be prosecuted for alleged abuses during his time in power. A regional force had been poised to force out Jammeh if last-ditch diplomatic efforts failed to persuade him to leave. Watch | Gambia crisis in 90 seconds 01:30 \nT he situation became so tense that Barrow had to be inaugurated in neighbouring Senegal at the Gambian Embassy. He said Saturday he would return to Gambia once it is \"clear\" and a security sweep is completed. \n\"What is fundamental here is he will live in a foreign country as of now,\" Barrow told The Associated Press. \nIn the Guinean capital, Conakry, witnesses said a special plane also landed from Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, with only a crew and no passengers, suggesting that could be Jammeh's final destination. Equatorial Guinea, unlike Guinea, is not a state party to the International Criminal Court. \nShortly after Jammeh's departure, the United Nations, African Union and the West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, issued a declaration saying that any country offering him and his family \"African hospitality\" should not be punished and that he should be free to return to Gambia in the future. \nThe joint statement did not include promises of amnesty but said the world and regional bodies \"commit to work with the government of the Gambia to prevent the seizure of assets and properties lawfully belonging to former President Jammeh or his family and those of his Cabinet members, government officials and party supporters.\" Adama Barrow is sworn in as President of Gambia at Gambia's embassy in Dakar Senegal Credit: AP \nJ ammeh, who seized power in a coup in 1994, once vowed to rule for a billion years. He represented one of a dwindling number of West African leaders staying in office without apparent limit. The success in getting him to leave peacefully may help the vast region move toward more stable transfers of power. \nHis departure has brought an end to the political crisis in this impoverished nation of 1.9 million, which promotes itself to overseas tourists as \"the Smiling Coast of Africa\" while being a major source of migrants heading north toward Europe.
