The thrilling superhero movie debuted years ago, and it’s praised construction was only heightened by its eclectic soundtrack. Later this year, the studio will finally release the film’s long-awaited sequel, and fans are already anticipating the project’s soundtrack. And, now, director James Gunn has revealed if all the songs featured in the film’s trailer will make it into the movie. \nOver on Twitter, a fan took a second to ask Gunn about the sequel’s soundtrack. The director was sent a tweet asking if all the trailers’ songs would be in the film, and here is what Gunn had to say: \n“All of them are from my short lists for songs I’d LIKE to fit in the movie. But not all of them are in the movie…” Gunn replied. \nOf course, fans should not be too surprised by this revelation. With a limited runtime, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 would need to trim certain songs for narrative scenes. TV spots are also an excellent place for the film to debut music that tonally fits with the sequel but might not make a full debut in its final cut. \nSo far, fans feel certain a few songs will make it into the film. In the past, Gunn has hinted that Fleetwood Mac’s songs will make it in, so it seems Blue Swede, Sweet, and even David Bowie could be on the chopping block.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:50:49.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
