Buttner had been battling cancer. \n“When is the last time you laughed at a business show? I don’t know,” Cavuto said, while choking up. “Business journalism is never gonna be the same. I just don’t know, now that she’s gone, whether we’ll ever be. Brenda Buttner. Gone way too soon at 55.” \nShe worked at Fox News for more than 16 years and was the host of “Bulls & Bears,” a Saturday morning business show. Buttner also often contributed to Cavuto’s show, “Your World With Neil Cavuto.” \nHere’s what you need to know about Buttner: 1. Buttner Was First Diagnosed With a Rare Breast Cancer, Which Spread to Her Eye & Brain Brenda Buttner has died of cancer at the age of 55. (Fox News) \nBrenda Buttner had been battling cancer since at least late 2015, when she talked about her fight with the disease on Twitte r for the first time. \nHer friend and former colleague, Tobin Smith, wrote on Facebook that her family knew it was coming, but are still in a state of shock. Smith said Buttner was first diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer, which spread to her eye and then to her brain. \n“She did chemo for years while still hosting Bulls & Bears and working the weekend news hits. She always said with a laugh “I wanted to lose a few pounds…well man this chemo diet works!” Smith wrote in a touching tribute: \nShe loved rainy days, cloudy places, motorcycles and her children most of all. I told her that I would spread a few of her ashes in her beloved Edinborough outside her favorite pub…she loved that idea. \nShe called me her “office husband” and I told her that “all I got was crap from her and none the benefits” and she would laugh a hearty obscenity in response. \nMy role in her life the last few years was to make her laugh…and I accomplished that goal on many phone calls. She was the type of friend you could not speak with with for months and then talk like we had just left off from yesterday. \nMy dear Brenda Buttner..she was the little sister I never had. I miss her terribly and yet she is in my heart forever and an inspiration to all that knew her and her battle. \nButtner’s fans often asked her for updates when she was not on TV because of the illness and she responded to them, thankful for the support, thoughts and prayers: Thanks so much, Mark. Fighting cancer. You are kind to send thoughts and prayers. I so appreciate your kindness. https://t.co/djqRYiC4r3 \n— brenda buttner (@brendabuttner) August 12, 2016 @RickBulow1974 I am battling cancer right now and hope to be back as soon as possible.

She Is Survived by Her 2 Daughters, Rebecca & Rachel My daughter at the polling place at 6am, very excited and proud to vote for the first vote. May we all celebrate this privilege as she does! pic.twitter.com/IuZtqKdM8N \n— brenda buttner (@brendabuttner) November 8, 2016 \nButtner is survived by her two daughters, Rebecca and Rachel Adkins. She posted a photo with one of her daughters after she photo for the first time in November. \n“Little things in life that defined the big things in Brenda’s life,” Cavuto said in his tribute. “A woman who would gloss over talking to financial and political kingpins as just another day at the office, far more eager to share her plans for girls night out with her daughters. No bravado, just brave, incredibly brave.” \nIn mid-January, she wrote on Facebook, “It may seem like a cliche, but it’s true. I am blessed with each day I awake and see my two beautiful daughters,” according to the Ridgewood Daily Voice. \nShe and her ex-husband, Tom Adkins, were married from 2005 to 2010. Adkins is a political pundit who has also appeared on Fox News. \nButtner was a resident of Ridgewood, New Jersey. 3. She Was Born in California & Graduated From Harvard University Before Becoming a Rhodes Scholar Yep, that's the brilliant @brendabuttner I got there. Lucky me! Blue skies, but we sure talked up a storm. pic.twitter.com/GSygZt9jce \n— Suzy Welch (@SuzyWelch) August 9, 2016 \nButtner was born in San Francisco, California, and grew up in Watsonville. \nShe graduated from Harvard University in 1983 with a degree in social studies. After graduating from Harvard, Buttner spent two years as a Rhodes Scholar at Bailliol College at Oxford University in England. She earned degrees in politics and economics while there. \nShe then went into the TV business. \n“She took stock of life much more than any stock in life. It’s what separated her from everyone else in this business. Not just dollars, you see, Brenda had depth,” Neal Cavuto said. “Let it be known that Brenda Buttner made us want to watch a business show with heart. Her heart, her spirit. She democratized dollars and just made sense.” 4. She Started Her TV Career at the NBC Affiliate in Reno & Spent Time Editing a Motorcycle Magazine \nButtner began her career in TV at the NBC affiliate KCRL in Reno, Nevada. \nShe also spent time working as the feature editor for Cycle World, a magazine for motorcycle enthusiasts. According to Neil Cavuto, Buttner loved motorcycles and quit her “astonishing broadcast career” to take the job editing the magazine because she thought it would be fun. \n“We used to joke that Brenda had sort of a different bucket list in life,” Cavuto said in his tribute to her. “When you saw hers you realized maybe yours was the odd one, because Brenda’s captured what really mattered in life, like how much she loved animals.” 5. She Hosted ‘The Money Club’ on CNBC Before Moving to Fox News in 2000 \nBefore moving to Fox News in 2000, Buttner worked for several years at CNBC, according to her bio. She hosted the show “The Money Club” at that network. She was among the first women to host a business news show on a cable channel. \n“Women are not afraid to simply admit they don’t know about something, which men rarely do,” Buttner told the Sun-Sentinel in 1997 . “So women realize there is no such thing as a stupid question when it comes to understanding an investment. Women also tend to be better at research and take the whole activity of investing more seriously. They don’t take ‘hot tips,’ know what their goals are and are not afraid to hold their investments for the long term. That is probably the most important key to successful investing.” \nButtner also worked as a Washington correspondent for CNBC from 1990 to 1993 and as general correspondent from 1995 to 1998. She won a “Cable Ace” award in 1996 for best business programming and a National Clarion Award in 1990 for best news story. \nIn addition to her TV work, Buttner’s writing about personal finance was published in several outlets, including The New York Times and Ladies’ Home Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:52:08.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
