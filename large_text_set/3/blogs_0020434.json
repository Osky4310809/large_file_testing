So when we first spotted the Benefit Cosmetics Cheek Parade Blush palette and realized it was only for sale in the UK, we felt a flutter of disappointment. Yes, for a limited time we could technically order it from House of Frazer and have it shipped across the ocean, but that window quickly closed and we were left weeping, blushless in the lurch.\nLuckily for us, the weeping can now end because according to Trendmood’s Instagram the Cheek Parade Blush palette is now stateside. Unfortunately, and just as we imagined, the blush palette quickly sold out on Sephora’s website , but we’re crossing our fingers Benefit releases the palette on their site later this month! We’ll be keeping our eyes peeled on Ulta Beauty, too.\nEven just hearing this news, we can feel the sun shining on our faces. This is a MUST! All in one Available NOW!!!!
