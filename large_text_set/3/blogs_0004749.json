Jamie Carragher says he is slightly suspicious that Tyrone Mings just carried on with the game after stamping on Zlatan Ibrahimovicâ€™s head \nFormer Premier League official Dermot Gallagher told Sky Sports News HQ on Monday Ibrahimovic's elbow \"ticks every box for a red card\" and a three-match ban. \nThat sanction would see United's top scorer miss Monday's FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea, as well as league meetings with Middlesbrough and West Brom. \nBournemouth's Andrew Surman was sent off in the aftermath of the 44th-minute incidents, but the visitors held out for a 1-1 draw as Ibrahimovic missed a late penalty.
