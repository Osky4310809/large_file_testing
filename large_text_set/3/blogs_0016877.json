Share Share Tweet \nIt’s been quite a week for Chelsea Clinton. \nThursday she announced that she’s writing a new children’s book, “She Persisted,” highlighting women overcame immense opposition to achieve their goals.” The same day, Expedia filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission naming her to the board of directors. (There was also all the publicity about her spinach pancakes on National Pancake Day, but we’ll ignore that.) \nThe Expedia gig comes by way of Barry Diller , majority shareholder, a longtime Clinton friend. Diller was also instrumental in Chelsea being named to the board of IAC/InterActiveCorp. Chelsea sat at Diller's table for a gala honoring Les Moonves. Notice the other attendees. All media people. https://t.co/kUbtX4jO6I pic.twitter.com/kZYlaZDf8B — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) March 18, 2017 \nClinton will be paid a $45,000 salary and $250,000 in stock, CNN Money reports, though Expedia’s filing simply states she will “be compensated in accordance with the Company’s standard compensation policies and practices for the Board.” She receives roughly the same amount for the IAC/InteractiveCorp. board position. \nDecent money for an extremely part-time position. \nIn addition to her position as Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation, Chelsea sits on the board of the School of American Ballet, the Africa Center, Weill Cornell Medical College and the Clinton Foundation's Clinton Health Access Initiative. \nExpedia’s board of directors was expanded from 13 to 14 members to allow Clinton to join.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T00:00:07.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
