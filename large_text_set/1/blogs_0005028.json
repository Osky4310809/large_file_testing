Guantanamo Bay \nPresident Barack Obama had sought to close the prison since he entered office in 2009, but has been unable to carry out the plan in the face of opposition from Congress. \nObama, in Nov. 2016, announced renewed plans for closing the facility in 2017, indicating he would release more prisoners in the final weeks of his term in office, which ends on Jan. 20. \nThe population at the prison has gradually decreased in light of the president’s long-standing goal of closing it. \nThere are currently 59 prisoners there, down from 105 at this time last year. \nThe last prisoner release occurred December 4. \nMany of the detainees at the prison have not been formally charged. \nAdditionally, 23 of them have been cleared for release by the Periodic Review Board, a Committee made up of representatives of several U.S. government departments. \nThe committee has determined that they present no meaningful threat to the security of the U.S. and can be returned to their home country or another country. \nBut 10 prisoners at Guantanamo have been charged with crimes, and the U.S. military commission has ongoing proceedings against them. \nLast month, the commission announced another round of pre-trial hearings in the death penalty case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammad beginning on Jan. 25. \nMohammad is charged as the alleged mastermind in the September 11, 2001, attacks.
