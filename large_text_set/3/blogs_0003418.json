Zuffenhausen’s track-bred sports car , moving onto the facelifted 991 body, has been breathed on to produce more power, and also offers enthusiasts with the gift of choice. \nThat’s because in addition to the standard seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission, the GT3 is now also available with (rejoice!) the much-requested six-speed manual, derived from the limited-edition 911 R . The engine it’s mated to is also new – a 4.0 litre (up from 3.8 litres) naturally-aspirated flat-six from the GT3 RS and 911 R, developing 500 hp at 8,500 rpm and 460 Nm of torque at 6,250 rpm. \nWith the PDK equipped, the car weighs 1,430 kg, and goes from zero to 100 km/h in just 3.4 seconds – 0.1 seconds faster than the outgoing model – before hitting a top speed of 318 km/h. Specifying the manual gearbox drops the pounds to 1,413 kg, but it means that the GT3 will take half a second longer to hit 100 km/h at 3.9 seconds, although the top speed is slightly higher at 319 km/h. \nThe chassis has also been reworked for even better driving dynamics – it sits 25 mm lower than the standard Carrera S, and as before there’s active rear steering, dynamic engine mounts and a locking rear differential. \nAs with every other facelifted 991, the GT3 receives a number of exterior revisions, including redesigned headlights with four-point LED daytime running lights, integrated door handle recesses and new tail lights. The GT3-specific front fascia has also been reworked for a more angular look – as has the rear diffuser – while vents have also been added on the rear engine cover. There’s a new carbon fibre rear wing, too. \nInside, the GT3 has been given a smaller 918 Spyder-style three-spoke steering wheel, as well as a new Porsche Communication Management (PCM) infotainment system and the Connect Plus Module with Apple CarPlay connectivity. The Porsche Track Precision App, which allow drivers to record and analyse driving data on their smartphones, is also bundled in as standard equipment. \nAs standard, the car comes with power-adjustable Sport Seats Plus with enhanced bolsters for increased lateral support. Buyers can also specify Adaptive Sport Seats Plus with 18-way electric adjustment, a powered steering column and a memory function, as well as fixed carbon fibre Full Bucket Seats.
