Instagram \nAn Instagram picture of their trip to the slopes indicated they were on holiday — and friends fear that them more vulnerable to a break-in. \nThe raiders are believed to have struck last Saturday after sneaking past security at the gated estate, The Sun reported. \nDetectives investigating the break-in are trying to establish if Terry’s home was specifically picked. \nA source said: “It’s a very real possibility that these burglars have seen some of their posts. \n“It’s like a catalogue for would-be thieves, and even played a part when Kim Kardashian was robbed in Paris.” John Terry and his wife Toni in the Maldives on a previous holiday (Photo: Instagram/johnterry.26) \nThe Terrys have reportedly now upgraded their security systems with extra patrols. \nThe £5million mock Georgian property has been home to the veteran defender’s family for three years. \nIt previously belonged to golf star Colin Montgomerie.
