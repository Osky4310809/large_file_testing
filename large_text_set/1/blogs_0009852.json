Test your engine compression \nIf the popping sound is more rhythmic and occurs more frequently as you rev the engine, you may want to look for an exhaust leak. The exhaust manifold is on the side (or sides) of your engine toward the bottom. A blown exhaust gasket can cause some pretty loud sounds from that area, but it will always be louder and faster as you rev the engine higher. IN some cases you may hear an exhaust leak like this when you first start the engine, but as it warms up it seems to magically seal itself! This is because the expansion of your exhaust manifolds’ metal can actually seal a small leak. Any exhaust leak should be taken care of as soon aspkossible. The possibility of carbon monoxide gas leaking into the passenger compartment can be deadly in the wrong conditions, so don’t stall on this repair. \nAnother pop-like sound that can come from the engine area involves your belts. If a belt is worn or frayed, often a piece of the belt will peel away but remain attached to the belt. This turns into a large, flapping noisemaker as it rotates through the pulleys and slaps against mounts, water pumps, alternators or whatever is in the way. This will make a rhythmic slapping or popping sound very different from an exhaust leak. A bad belt needs to be replaced as soon as possible or it is likely to leave you stranded someplace. \nPopping sounds can be hard to pinpoint. Before you convince yourself that your engine is going pop-pop-pop, be sure the noise isn't actually a clunk or knock coming from your suspension or steering. There are different problems, no less serious but different in terms of diagnosis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:53:05.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
