He's wearing that. pic.twitter.com/AChF8VgE8z \n— Marc D'Amico (@Marc_DAmico) January 28, 2017 \n\nBut there was only one small hitch in the White Mamba’s otherwise flawless wardrobe: his last name is misspelled. \nThe best part about Scalabrine's green Scalabrine jacket is that Scalabrine is spelled wrong … pic.twitter.com/Kmw8I1msEj \n— Ben Rohrbach (@brohrbach) January 28, 2017 \n\nNot that it matters. Scalabrine has carte blanche to do pretty much whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Let’s not forget that this is the same man who didn’t hesitate to be the first one to the podium when the Celtics won the championship in 2008. It’s also the same man who challenged everyone in the Boston metropolitan area to play him one-on-one to prove that even the most marginal NBA players are exponentially more talented than the average street-baller. \nHere’s to hoping we see much, much more of him on the sidelines, in the broadcast booth, or anywhere else there’s basketball to be played and commented on.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:37:11.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
