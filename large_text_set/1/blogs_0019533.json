Jan 19, 2017 4:40 PM \n… and the excuses continue to pile up. stoneydog1000 says: Jan 19, 2017 4:40 PM \nI used to have hangovers, I mean the flu, all the time when I was at that age. jakec4 says: Jan 19, 2017 4:48 PM \nShorter rest than New England-delayed start time in KC- Antonio Brown distraction- the flu- communication shenanigans at Gilette…..What else am I missing….Doesn’t matter. The great Mike Tomlin makes no excuses!! LSUStrong says: Jan 19, 2017 4:51 PM \nWell Blount had the flu, hopefully it has already run it’s course through the Patriots organization. maust1013 says: Jan 19, 2017 4:54 PM \nIt’s that time of year. The flu was going through NE’s locker room last week, wouldn’t be surprised if it still is. margoadams says: Jan 19, 2017 5:03 PM \nThis is where the Steelers will more probably than not be staying: Renaissance, Westin, Biltmore and Hilton in Providence. Rest up Tomlin. steve717 says: Jan 19, 2017 5:03 PM \nI wonder how much money the Patriots will be fined and what draft pick(s) they will lose for this. Jan 19, 2017 5:06 PM \nBill sent Blount to visit. Always cheating somehow, right haters? erniecohen says: Jan 19, 2017 5:06 PM \nI don’t understand why flu, depending on the type, can’t be immensely damaging to a team’s performance. greenlargo says: Jan 19, 2017 5:10 PM \nThats surprising they are sick. Especially after Belichick sent that guy down to give them those vaccinations for their trip to Foxboro you wouldn’t think they would be catching anything. And I thought that was really sweet of him to care like that.

That would definately affect my game if I was a football player. Jan 19, 2017 5:15 PM \nBelichick has a secret viral lab located under Foxboro. CBA doesn’t have any germ-warfare provisions, so its open season on plagues for competitive advantage. spotsdad says: Jan 19, 2017 5:17 PM \nBelichick has been spotted 36 hours and still is waaay behind on the excuses. Get on the ball, Bill! patsfan4lifesbchamps says: Jan 19, 2017 5:22 PM \nSuch a soft team. Flu did not slow down Michael Jordan and it shouldn’t slow down the Steelers. deuce2222 says: Jan 19, 2017 5:31 PM \nThis is an ultimate low for Belichick. truthdispensary says: Jan 19, 2017 5:35 PM \nI wonder how much Kraft paid to have his minions spread “bugs” around the Steelers facilities.
