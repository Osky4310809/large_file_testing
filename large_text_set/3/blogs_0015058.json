You draw the path you&apos;d like the words to take, then type in your message, and the text flows along the path. The custom options are the real killer feature here, with you being able to adjust the font, letter spacing, and alignment. The photo filters are best avoided, though.\n13. Over \nOver is another typography app for adding type to images Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad) While a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes you need some words as well to let people know what they&apos;re looking at. The iPhone app Over is the perfect choice for any Instagram addict, enabling you to add typography to your images quickly and easily.\n14. Quick Platform : iOS and Android Quick is a free alternative to Over (see above) from the same developers. It doesn&apos;t have as many fonts to choose from as the original paid-for version, but more are available as in-app purchases and there&apos;s still plenty of fun to be had. It offers a great user experience too.\n15. iFontMaker Platform : iOS (iPad), Windows Actually creating typefaces and fonts on an iPad might seem like an odd thing to do, but iFontMaker by Eiji Nishidai provides a straightforward interface for hand-drawn efforts that can subsequently be emailed or converted into a TTF file. In getting you away from standard tools and on to your iPad, there's also scope for 'thinking different', so to speak.\n16. TypeDrawing \nThis fun typography app is for drawing with type Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad), web So this app, developed by Hansol Huh , is actually a bit of a toy, but it&apos;s a very nice one. You type some text, pick a font and then finger-paint on the screen, adjusting type size, spacing, rotation and colour as you go.

WhatTheFont \nDiscover fonts or very close approximations with this typography app Platform : iOS (iPhone), Web app Everyone who works with typefaces and fonts at some point sees a piece of lettering and wonders what font is being used. WhatTheFont enables you to take a photo and – with a little luck – identify the font you’re looking at. \nDoes it always work? No. But when it does, it&apos;s a little slice of fried tech gold. Don&apos;t bother with the mobile version; it hasn&apos;t been updated in years and the web app works just fine.\n18. Paper Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad) Paper&apos;s the closest thing on iOS to actual paper, offering a tactile experience via a bunch of bolt-on modules for sketching and colouring, which are useful for getting down font-design notes and ideas. Creator FiftyThree suggests using it with its Pencil stylus.\n19. FontBook \nFontbook is a great typography app for researching and comparing typefaces Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad) On its release, FontBook was already a fantastic resource for researching and comparing typefaces and fonts, documenting the work of over a hundred type foundries. And then they went and updated it for the new iPad's Retina display, resulting in the closest thing to font porn you'll get on your device.\n20. Byword \nByword is an extremely handy typography app Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad), OS X Although typographers have to deal with how typefaces and fonts look, they must often edit and write, too. On the iPad, plenty of heavily focused text-editing apps exist, but Byword gets our vote, primarily because it offers a live on-screen word-and-character count – handy for when you need to smash copy into a set space.\nPage 3: More typography apps to try out \n21. Typography Insight Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad) A must-buy for anyone learning about or studying fonts, Typography Insight was created by Dong Yoon Park , an MFA design and technology student at Parsons The New School for Design .

The app lets you inspect the details of different typefaces, plus there are sections that teach how to measure typefaces and how to set type.\n22. FontBrowser \nA curiously old-school typography app, but FontBrowser still appeals Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad) This app appears to have been repeatedly beaten with an ugly stick, but it's a useful freebie for browsing Unicode fonts and keystrokes. Symbols can be searched by type, saving precious minutes if you're frantically looking for a particular arrow symbol.\n23. Quark DesignPad \nNot a typography app, but a useful tool for typographers Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad) Quark&apos;s free iPad app isn&apos;t a typography tool per se – instead it&apos;s a product that enables you to rapidly wireframe grid-based designs. But given that many people who deal with typefaces and fonts on a daily basis also need to rapidly work up page layouts, we&apos;d say DesignPad could become an indispensable part of your toolkit.\n24. Palettes Pro \nAnother typographer's tool rather than typography app, but a very useful one Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad) Designers of all kinds need to have a tool for creating colour palettes, and that includes typographers too – not least to check the contrast between type and background. Developed by Rick Maddy, Palettes Pro is a great standalone tool for your device, and it can export palettes when you need to work with them in Photoshop or Illustrator.\n25. Fontli \nUse Fontli to discover inspirational photography of type throughout the world Platform : iOS (iPhone and iPad), Android, Windows Fontli is a social network of type lovers, where community members can collect and share inspiring examples of typography from everyday life.
