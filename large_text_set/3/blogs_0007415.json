Graphiq \nThe matter will also go up for a vote twice–as a general bylaw amendment and a zoning amendment–at Westboro’s Town Meeting on March 18. Malloy said the wide margin of the town vote bodes well for the ban passing both town meeting votes. \nWestboro residents had mixed reactions to the decision. \nNicolina Sabatini owns a high-end women’s clothing shop. She said a marijuana retail location in town wouldn’t deter her customers. \n“I have clients that come from everywhere. They would not run off. They would still come. Even if there was a pot shop they would still come here. So I am all for it,” said Sabatini. \nAnother resident, however, agrees with the Board of Selectmen. \n“(Marijuana) shouldn’t be allowed. It’s a gateway,” the man said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T03:01:53.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
