Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images Reuters Monday 16 January 2017 04.58 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nThe pound has slipped to three-month lows in Asian trading with investors again spooked by concerns over Britain’s exit from the European Union. \nSterling sank 1.6% to as low as $1.1983 early on Monday, depths not seen since the flash crash of October , having finished at around $1.2175 in New York on Friday. It was at $1.2032 shortly before 5am GMT. \nDealers said the market was reacting in part to reports that Theresa May will use a speech on Tuesday to signal plans for a “hard Brexit” , quitting the EU’s single market to regain control of Britain’s borders. \nInvestors have been worried such a decisive break from the single market would hurt British exports and drive foreign investment out of the country.

So far, she has revealed few details about what kind of deal she will seek, frustrating some investors, businesses and MPs. \nMay’s speech on Tuesday will stress the need for Britons, who voted for Brexit by 52 to 48% in last June’s referendum, to unite around common goals such as protecting and enhancing workers’ rights. \nChris Weston, of IG in Melbourne, said: “The market is now positioning for some fairly punchy rhetoric from Theresa May and this idea of ‘hard Brexit’. A clean break from the single market seems increasingly likely. \n“We also hear from the UK Supreme Court this week amid a market is starting to head towards a ‘hard Brexit’ and the great unknown. Forget the run of good UK data, GBP is an out-and-out political currency (it has been for a while) and the prospect of volatility here is now very high.” \nThe FTSE 100, however, was expected to rise on Monday morning with futures trading pointing to an 18-point gain. \nThe euro was up 0.9% at 88.27p, while sterling fell 1.4% on the perceived safe-haven yen to 137.65 yen. The Japanese currency gained broadly, with the US dollar dipping 0.2 percent to 114.30 yen, moving back toward last week’s low of 113.75. \nIn another signal of investor nerves, a study released on Monday forecast that mergers and acquisitions activity in the UK will drop sharply in 2017 due to uncertainty over Brexit. \nThe law firm Baker McKenzie said that while M&A activity would have only a modest impact on European transactions if there was an amicable divorce, the lack of clarity over Brexit could hurt activity in the UK. \nBaker McKenzie and Oxford Economics said they forecast M&A values to fall to $125bn in 2017 from the record $340bn in 2016. \n“Given Brexit’s impact on business confidence, we expect M&A values to fall by two-thirds in 2017 after numerous large deals in the first half of last year boosted 2016,” said Tim Gee, London M&A partner at Baker McKenzie. \nThe dollar index put in its worst weekly performance in more than two months last week as investors reconsidered the whole “reflation” trade – that Trump’s promises of debt-funded fiscal spending and lower taxes would stoke inflation and drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. \nThe market will be focused this week on Trump’s inauguration on Friday for any clarity on his economic plans. \n“The market is showing greater reluctance to push on with reflation-type trades without more details of proposed fiscal spending plans and the economic data to back it up,” said analysts at ANZ in a research note.

Some decent positive surprises may be necessary for the market to gain conviction.“ \nAsian markets are also waiting anxiously to see if Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and starts to follow up on a threat to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods. \nAnalysts fret that the spectre of deteriorating US-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on the confidence of exporters and investors worldwide. \nWall Street ended last week mixed, with the Dow off slightly but the Nasdaq at a record high.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T07:08:04.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
