Klavan is hopeful Liverpool can turn their form around and make the top four (Photo: PA) Liverpool came from behind to beat Burnley last weekend (Photo: Liverpool FC) \n“Everybody talks to me about Steven Gerrard. He wasn’t the kind of person, who was just on the field screaming and yelling at everybody. \n“He had other qualities that could motivate a team. When he had something to say his words were spot on. \n“It doesn’t make you the best captain simply because you are the loudest. There are many different styles and you must remember that it’s not just how you are on the field, but how you are in the locker rooms that can make you a leader or a good captain. Klavan says that Gerrard's leadership has been mentioned (Photo: Stu Forster) Liverpool have slipped outside of the top four (Photo: Reuters) \n“I’m not the loudest guy in the locker room or on the pitch. If I need to say something when it needs saying then I don’t yell. I prefer to tell people one on one what I think about a situation.” \nKlavan, 31, insists Liverpool can still make the Champions League despite their dismal run in January and February. \n“At Liverpool we are working every day to achieve that goal,” he said. “Everybody here wants to be playing in the Champions League. \n“We had that consistency at the start of the season and although we have also had low points, I still think we have a great chance to finish in the top four.” poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:47:34.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
