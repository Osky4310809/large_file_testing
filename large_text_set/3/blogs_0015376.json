Drew Barrymore 's brand, Flower Beauty, is exclusively available there and absolutely worth trying. The formulas are quite pigmented, often long-wearing, and are beautifully packaged. Case in point: the Flower Pots blush.\nThese silky, vibrant cheek colors are embossed with the brand's signature posy (which seems to be a camellia), which makes them just as pretty in the compact as they do when worn. They're available in five shades and are a total steal at only $10 each. You could buy all five and it would still be cheaper than a fancy bouquet! Not only are they incredibly affordable, they're also cruelty-free (as if you needed another reason to buy them).\nRead on to shop — and see swatches of! — all five shades.\nRelated:\nThis Affordable Rose Blush Is Better Than a Valentine's Day Bouquet\nPrevious Next", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:50:35.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
