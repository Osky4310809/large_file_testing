It’s hardly surprising — given their efforts to remain in the public eye — that they’ve amassed more than five million members and supporters. As famous as they are for getting celebs to declare they’d rather go naked than wear fur as they are for eye catching protests featuring naked people covered in blood (they get a lot of press with their savvy use of nudity), the controversial organization has re-entered the public eye with a new video targeting the concept of outdoor dogs. \nThe legitimately heart breaking video (it’s seriously in Sarah McLachlan and the ASPCA territory) features neglected dogs left chained in the yard in all sort of conditions. One has an open wound, another hides under the overhang of a shelter while rain drips on its soaked little face, and others tremble as they stare into the camera. Over these images, celebrities voice the thoughts of these dogs. “When you first got me, did you know you were going to chain me up and leave me outside even in the cold and snow? Did you know that you would never even touch me even when all I wanted was to be petted?” Damn, Bane, you’re making us feel horrible. \n\n\nTo bring attention to the plight of these forgotten animals, multiple celebs stepped up, many of whom have worked with PETA before. Included are Priyanka Chopra, Tom Hardy, Casey Affleck, Bill Maher, Edie Falco, Kate del Castillo, D.R.A.M., and Courtney Stodden. Casey Affleck has been vocally vegan for years (in 2013 he wrote to the members of the Massachusetts Senate asking them to support a bill prohibiting cruelty to farm animals) and has worked with PETA in the past. Priyanka Chopra has also worked with PETA, lending her voice to a mechanical elephant named Ellie who helps teach children to say “no” to the circus. Courtney Stodden is also an old friend of the organization, having been part of an Uncle Sam-inspired poster to get people to go vegan and having participated in numerous protests, including one where she served veggie dogs on Capitol Hill while wearing a lettuce bikini. And, Tom Hardy and his dog Woodstock were featured in a campaign advocating for animal adoption , rather than purchasing them through pet stores and breeders. \nThough PETA may, at times, be off putting it’s hard to argue with their assertion : “Dogs are pack animals who aim to please their guardians, and all they want is to spend time with the rest of the family—and live—indoors. That’s where they’re healthiest and happiest.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:34:27.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
