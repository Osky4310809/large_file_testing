How did it happen? Take this quiz to find out! 1. Well, here you are. You’ve been reassigned to the school’s landscaping crew, and it’s entirely because of your jackass contributions to the class’ discussion of Animal Farm . How are you feeling? I don’t know how this happened. The teacher must have misunderstood what I was saying. Not good. I feel like I was really just hitting my stride in there, too. This is the best-case scenario for me. 2. Interesting. Just so we can get a better grip on the situation here, which moronic theme did you stubbornly claim to be the most important in Animal Farm after waving your arm around like a maniac, saying “Pick me, pick me,” ultimately leaving the faculty no choice but to banish you to the landscaping shed? In the Animal Farm universe, the pigs are the priests and the actual, human priests are all dead. This is made evident by the pigs’ ability to talk and wear clothes, two things that human priests are well-known to do. WE are the animals, and our COATS are our fur, our HATS are our collars, and our TEETH are the animal teeth. It’s as simple as that. Most of the animals represent my dad. Boxer, the laboring horse; Old Major, the prize-winning boar; and even Napoleon, the power-hungry pig whose corrupt policies lead to conflict and bloodshed—all are supposed to be my dad. I want to bury this copy of Animal Farm near bushes. \nGood lord. You should have just kept your head down and maybe you’d still be working your way toward graduation. 3. Yikes. All right, well, from there your teacher must have tipped her hand that pawning you off to be the groundskeeper’s problem could be in the cards. Which of these ways did the faculty telegraph your fate of shoveling, raking, and mowing? The teacher muttered, “You will be mulching so soon,” under her breath while looking wistfully out the window at the landscaping tools. The principal came into the classroom, quickly measured me for a trowel, then left. There was a bucket of wood chips and shears on my desk when I came back from lunch. A few teachers poked their head into the classroom, reminded everyone that landscaping is always a punishment, then left. 4. Once the overarching themes of Animal Farm are discussed, it’s pretty standard for the lesson to touch on the Orwellian idea of “doublethink,” and for the teacher to prompt students to come up with some examples. So, which of these imbecilic doublespeak examples did you let spill from your dumbass mouth and set you on the fast track to plant patrol? Horsegods: Horsegods are titans of the farm. The hens can’t talk to the horsegods, but they can pray to them. Meanwhile, the priest pigs are powerful enough to communicate with horsegods directly, by miming. Human-DOING: WE are the farm, our CELL PHONES are the troughs we lick from, the MEDIA is the manure, and there are ROCKS in my locker. Dadboar: Dadboar is an example of doublespeak because my dad is not a boar in real life, but he certainly is a boar in this book, among other animals. Mudbook: a book inside the Earth, via the dirt. \nThe fact that your teachers were discrete in shuffling you off to the landscaping crew is honestly a testament to their professionalism. 5. We’re sure you talked about the Russian Revolution of 1917, too. Oof. What dipshit parallel did you draw between Animal Farm and Russia’s political history that was awful enough to have the faculty quietly anoint you as the new landscaping apprentice? Russian priests are famous for their smooth T-shirts and pants, which is why Orwell explained how the pigs wore perfectly smooth T-shirts and pants for the bulk of chapters four, five, and six. We need to be looking at RUSSIA through the lens of the DOG’S eyes, the GOAT’S beard, and the human HEART. The Soviet Union was home to people who were not allowed to BLINK, and yet, that’s all some animals ever do. My dad works with two Russian men at his office, who sometimes come over for dinner. By making the Soviet undertones such a strong motif in Animal Farm , Orwell is calling to mind the kindness of my dad’s Russian friends and making readers wonder if the two men are, perhaps, brothers. I want to own a landscaping company one day, and we will mostly cover books in leaves and grass. 6. Okay, we think we understand now. By this point, there was no turning back. The wheels were already in motion, and you were about to be discreetly reassigned to the landscaping crew due to your absolutely ludicrous interpretation of Animal Farm , and it sounds like it was deserved. How did the faculty pull the trigger and passive-aggressively transform you from student to landscaper? The custodial staff came into the classroom and began stuffing my backpack with wet leaves while saying, “This is your work now.” The teacher started responding to my contributions with, “I’m sorry, but members of the landscaping crew cannot speak in this classroom,” until I got the hint and walked outside and waited to be told what to do. Landscapers began silently slipping into the classroom to stand by my desk until there were dozens surrounding me, then the other kids started whispering, “Just go already.” The guidance counselor handed me a brown bag of seeds in the hallway as I was walking to the bathroom and then two brown bags of seeds as I was walking back to class. 7. How many of these ways have you tried to get back into the classroom since your impossibly dumb takes got you exiled to landscaping purgatory? I tapped on the classroom window with a rake for 30 minutes while screaming, “The horses are the husbands and the chickens are the wives because the pigs are okay with it!” I spelled out “We are the ANIMAL BARN” with dead flowers in the quad. I drew a picture of George Orwell shaking my dad’s hand and slid it under the front door of the school. I dug enough holes for everyone’s books near the baseball field, to smooth things over with the class.
