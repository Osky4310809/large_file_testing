By: FE Online | Updated: March 11, 2017 1:28 PM Hardwar Rural constituency assembly election winner 2017: Yatishwaranand from BJP wins; CM Harish Rawat from Congress loses. (PTI) \nHardwar Rural constituency assembly election winner 2017: Yatishwaranand from BJP wins; CM Harish Rawat from Congress loses. After the massive political chaos occurred in the state of Uttarakhand last year wherein chief minister Harish Rawat were charged with allegations of corruption that even led to his floor test, the voters exercised their rights to elect the fresh government. The state witnessed record 68 percent voting for 69 constituencies held in a single phase on February 15. The state came into existence in year 2000 after it was carved out of the state of Uttar Pradesh. The state has seen three elections so far and the voters have elected either Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or Congress. This time again there is a tough competition between the two big parties. The Congress has worked hard to retain power in the face of anti-incumbency and its dwindling fortunes in other states, while BJP has put all its effort to gain power in the state. In the past few months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress vice president had extensively campaigned for their respective parties and did their best to woo 75 Lakh voters of the state. A whopping 628 candidates were in the fray for 69 seats. In the last Assembly elections held in 2012, no party got majority. The Congress was the single largest party and it forged a post-poll alliance with the PDF to form government in the state. The BJP was the runner-up and it sat in opposition. \nHardwar Vidhan Sabha constituency is one of total legislative assemblies of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly. \nNumber of voters? \nWhat are the key issues? \nBesides unemployment and migration, lack of power and other infrastructures like road constitute major electoral issues in the region. \nWho was the winner last time? \nThe BJP defeated Congress by 8,620 votes to win this constituency during the 2012 Assembly elections. BJP candidate Madan Kaushik Joshi won the constituency by 42,297 votes followed by Satpal Brahamchari of the Congress who got 33,677 votes. \nWho are the competing candidates? \nMadan Kaushik (BJP), Anju Mittal (BSP), Brahmswroop Brahmchari, (INC), Adesh, (UKKD) and Adesh Kumar (AVIRP) along with four independents candidates namely Manoj Kumar Sharma, R avish Bhatija, Rajkumar Aggrwal and Vijay Laxmi. \nWhy this constituency is important? The constitutency of Kichha is important because current Chief Minister Harish Rawat contests elections from here.
