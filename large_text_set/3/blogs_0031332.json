The Lady Bulldogs were on the other end of a walloping from University of the Philippines, 25-14, 25-27, 25-21, 25-12, Sunday at Smart Araneta Coliseum. “That’s normal, there will always be a winner and a loser, we just have to improve from the loss,” said Mabbayad, whose team slipped to a 7-5 record. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that the kids will have a low morale after the loss, we just have to motivate them after the loss.” ADVERTISEMENT The Lady Bulldogs’ 7-5 record currently is not enough to bolt them into the Final Four picture as the Lady Maroons have a better point-total than them, 22-19. The Lady Bulldogs, however, are not the only ones in such scenario as the Lady Maroons and University of Santo Tomas are in similar positions. Even Far Eastern University, which has a 5-6 slate, can still pull off a Final Four finish. This scenario puts the Lady Bulldogs in a must-win situation if they want to enter the semifinals. “These two remaining games are must-win for us, but we aren’t the only ones who have to win because other teams too have to take their remaining games,” said Mabbayad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T00:05:48.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
