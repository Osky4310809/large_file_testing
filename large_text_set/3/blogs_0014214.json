But when Martin asked a flight attendant to move her to another row so that the dog could lie down, the attendant reportedly refused, and told her to leave the flight and talk to a ticketing agent.\nWhen Martin tried to upgrade to a first-class seat with that agent, she said she was told that guide dogs cannot be in the first-class cabin. Martin said she knew that couldn’t be the case as it would qualify as illegal discrimination.\nFrom Coinage: Find Out Where Coins Go After You Toss Them in a Fountain \nWhen Martin reboarded the flight, she said a passenger in the first-class cabin offered up his seat. Martin agreed, but was then approached by an American Airlines employee who said she had to get off the flight.\nHe told her that her “‘presence on the plane is not safe,’ or some stupid thing,” Martin told the Herald . “I’ve never been so humiliated and traumatized.”\nIn response to requests for comment, American Airlines said it was in contact with Martin and investigating the incident.\n“We apologize to Ms. Martin for the recent experience she had on American Airlines,” a spokesperson for American Airlines said in a statement. “We take these allegations very seriously, and are thoroughly investigating. Service animals are welcome on all of our flights.”\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T01:33:23.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
