Brewery Ommegang is making a batch of 9% Belgian-style golden ale called “Bend the Knee” set to release around Memorial Day. It will come in 750ml bottles featuring the sigils of the Stark, Targaryen, and Lannister houses. 2 \nThey aren’t new to the scene though, Ommegang partned with HBO back in 2013 and they already have seven “GOT” beers in the collection. 3 \nThe first beer in the collection was released ahead of season three. It’s a blonde ale called Iron Throne. 4 \nThe Ommegang website describes Take the Black Stout as a “deep, dark and complex like those who have sworn the oath to defend Westeros against threats from the north. The label depicts the Weirwood tree where Jon Snow recited the oath before joining the Night’s Watch.” 5 \nThe third beer is “named after the motto of House Targaryen, Fire and Blood is inspired by Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons, Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion. To celebrate the rebirth of dragons, three different labels were created by the Game of Thrones visual effects specialists, each depicting one of Daenerys’ feared dragons.” Advertisement Advertisement 6 \nFans selected an Abbey Dubbel named “VALAR MORGHULIS” as the next brew with the two-headed coin on the label. 7 \nThe Three-Eyed Raven is saison and a dark beer. 8 \nSeven Kingdoms is a mix between a traditional Belgian-style wheat and a hop-forward American ale. 9 \nValar Dohaeris is the season six beer in the series. 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:38:17.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
