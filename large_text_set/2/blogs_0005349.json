(AP/KDKA) – A Syrian family with valid green cards — blocked at Philadelphia International Airport on Saturday — returned to the Commonwealth on Monday. \n“My family is here with me safe. We are so excited,” said one of the family members. \nThe six Syrians — two brothers with their wives and two children — entered the USA on Monday through JFK International Airport after a judge put President Trump’s executive order on hold. \nThe Assali family was fleeing the civil war in Syria. \n“Unhuman what happened to us,” said one family member. \nThey were attempting to join their family in Allentown, when turned back. \n“The plane, all of us was very scared. We don’t know what happened. We played by the rules. We don’t do anything wrong.” \nIn Pennsylvania, the family was greeted by Governor Tom Wolf. \n“It’s really wonderful to welcome the entire family. Think of what they’ve been through,” said Wolf. \n“They’ve been trying to get an immigration visa since 2003. They haven’t asked for anything special. They’ve been going through the process for 13 years,” added the governor. \n“Today we woke up to a new dream, and I am so thankful that they are behind me., and they are safe with us,” said an Assali family member. \nWolf said he hoped the Assalis would make Pennsylvania their home. \n“As they get settled, I hope they find Pennsylvania every bit as attractive as all the rest of us Pennsylvanians have.” \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n\n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
