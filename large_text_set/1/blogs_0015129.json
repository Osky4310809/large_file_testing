Photo: Reuters TV \nFlashing a two-finger peace sign is very common among Japanese when posing for a photo. \nEchizen and fellow researcher Tateo Ogane reproduced an experiment on Friday in which they extracted Echizen's fingerprints from a digital photograph taken at a distance of 3 metres. \nThe high-resolution photograph was taken with a 135mm lens mounted on a digital SLR camera. \nFingerprint scanners have found their way into mobile phones, laptops, external hard drives and electronic wallets as an alternative to authentication using passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs). \nNTT Docomo, Japan's biggest mobile carrier, said it had not received any reports of misuse of fingerprint data on customers' devices. \n\"Fingerprint authentication is used for many purposes, including smartphones, and each manufacturer decides how the authentication process is maintained,\" said spokesman Yasutaka Imai. \"We'll continue to monitor the situation carefully\". \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:59:40.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
