In this regard, we stressed the need to address traditional and emerging threats to our collective security and stability,” Mr. Duterte said, emerging from the Government House with the Thai prime minister after their meeting. \n“We stressed the importance of our defense cooperation to achieve these goals and looked forward to the inaugural joint committee on military cooperation this year,” Mr. Duterte said.

Mr. Duterte said he and Prayut agreed on the need to expand and intensify two-way trade and investments. \n“Economic reforms are being instituted in the Philippines. With our emphasis on combatting corruption, eradicating criminality and dismantling the illegal drug trade apparatus, we are hopeful of more investments coming from Thailand,” Mr. Duterte said. \n3 agreements \nTo further advance economic ties between the Philippines and Thailand, three agreements were signed in the fields of science and technology, tourism and agriculture.
