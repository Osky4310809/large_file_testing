This video requires your undivided attention.\nSo, it’s totally cute when your and your canine companion can get along wonderfully like the soulmates that you are, but we might have just stumbled upon the best human-dog relationship ever . How else do you get a dog to carefully observe and mimic choreography? Can someone tell us why this animal didn’t participate in the Westminster Dog Show ? This is some top-notch dog talent.\nAs Bored Panda reports, the dancing dog of our dreams is a 2-year-old Australian Shepherd named Secret (which we’re assuming refers to these dance skills she’s been keeping under wraps). Secret and her human Mary obviously don’t have time for ordinary dog stuff like playing fetch or going for long walks because they would rather spend their days dancing side by side.\nHere's a little video of us learning a step my lovely best friend @my_berner_girl made up for Secret! She just learned it, and I think it might be her favorite dance step to do so far ❤ We've had a blast learning this one, thanks for the awesome choreography my friend! #irishdance Follow my Pawtners @borderaussiebodey @sassyandsila @lilly.the.aussie @bluebearaussie \nA post shared by Mary & Secret (@my_aussie_gal) on Sep 25, 2016 at 7:50pm PDT \nImpressive, right? Well that’s not all Secret can do.\nHer balancing skills are off the charts.
