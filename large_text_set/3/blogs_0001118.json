Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images     21.57 GMT Last modified on   22.05 GMT \nNewcastle United have reasserted themselves on the Championship. In a remarkable finale on the south coast Rafael Benítez’s side, so toothless for long periods, scored twice in the final nine minutes to overturn Brighton & Hove Albion’s lead and leapfrog their hosts to the top of the division. The destiny of the title was not settled here but a psychological blow was struck. The celebrations, from touchline to away end, were riotous. \nThe manner of the victory, this team’s first after conceding the opening goal this term, almost defied belief. Newcastle had only just drawn level, reward for frantic late pressure, when Matt Ritchie conjured a glorious crossfield pass that bypassed Bruno Saltor for Christian Atsu to collect down the left. The winger teased his way into the penalty area before squaring for Ayoze Pérez, who had been on the pitch only eight minutes, to convert with glee. The sense of local deflation was palpable. Newcastle, with awkward trips to Huddersfield, Reading and Fulham ahead, needed this. Brighton promotion would be bigger feat than taking Newcastle up, says Hughton Read more \nThey have stamped some authority on the pursuit of automatic promotion. \nThis had the feel of a Premier League fixture in waiting, a sense of expectation crackling round the arena before kick-off and the locals, so desperate for that first taste of top-flight football in 34 years, bellowing their team into an early ascendancy. It had been the Brighton captain, Bruno, who had brought up an early-season defeat on Tyneside on the eve of the game to suggest his team’s motivation might partly be spurred by thoughts of revenge. This team are not used to defeat, having suffered only nine in their previous 80 second-tier fixtures, meaning every reverse stands out. Their early urgency was summed up by Shane Duffy’s crunching challenge on a dawdling Mohamed Diamé, and maintained until it produced a lead. \nThe award of the penalty from which Brighton edged ahead had provoked outrage from Newcastle’s players and management staff alike. Bobby Madley had marched to the centre of the scrum on the edge of the six-yard box 13 minutes in, while Anthony Knockaert was still waiting to deliver, to warn players from both sides any hint of wrestling might be penalised, yet there was still an inevitability about the tussle that ensued between Glenn Murray and Ciaran Clark. Perhaps key was the slight nudge from Jamaal Lascelles on the striker, still grappling with his marker, which sent him crumpling to the turf. Murray picked himself up to slot in a 17th goal of the campaign as reward for Brighton’s initial effervescence. \nKarl Darlow had excelled in that frantic period, pushing away Bruno’s crunched volley and repeating that trick from Murray before the break. Just prior to the spot-kick, Jamie Murphy and Knockaert had combined at a free-kick taken short, with the Frenchman flicking the ball up and lobbing it over the defensive wall where Sam Baldock lurked on the turn. The striker’s shot had been mistimed, but Darlow was still required to turn the effort aside. \nOnce ahead Brighton could settle into their comfort zone, springing on the counterattack as they had so often and impressively against Reading on Saturday. Newcastle, lacking Dwight Gayle’s bite up front, and their manager were a picture of frustration. \nYet at least they had offered signs of life as Jonjo Shelvey’s influence grew. Ritchie’s cross had kissed the top of the bar, indicative of a team finding their range, before Christian Atsu started to unnerve his fellow Chelsea loanee, the substitute Fikayo Tomori, down the home side’s left. The Ghanaian’s pace set him apart and tended to spread panic, with Diamé and Ritchie fluffing their lines in the middle and David Stockdale smothering Yoan Gouffran’s long-range attempt. \nAtsu eventually decided he would take the initiative himself and connected sweetly with DeAndre Yedlin’s delivery from the right in stoppage time at the end of the first half, only for his effort to be pushed away by Stockdale. \nThe goalkeeper was soon reacting swiftly upon the restart to spare the blushes of both Dale Stephens and Steve Sidwell, who had inadvertently liberated Gouffran through the centre, with the tempo and thrill of the contest relentless. It needed Paul Dummett to hack Lewis Dunk’s looped header desperately from the goalline, and Darlow to thwart the impressive Knockaert but, amid that flurry of opportunities, Gouffran really should have equalised when presented with possession inexplicably by Stockdale. The goalkeeper redeemed himself to block, but those spasms of uncharacteristic sloppiness had local nerves jangling. \nThe visitors’ late pressure would eventually tell. Benitez flung on Daryl Murphy in desperate pursuit of parity, the Republic of Ireland forward immediately planting a free header from a corner straight at Stockdale. The striker’s second header, flicked goalwards from Ritchie’s whipped centre, had to be pushed behind with the visitors rewarded at the corner. Stockdale had mustered a punch from Ritchie’s delivery with the ball falling to Atsu on the edge of the area. The winger’s attempt was rushed, squirting off his boot away from goal only to strike Diamé and loop over Tomori on the goal-line. The Senegalese could hardly believe his good fortune, celebrating only sheepishly. The more boisterous reaction was still to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:29:36.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
