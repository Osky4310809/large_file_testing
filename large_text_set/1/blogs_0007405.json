Unknown Xiaomi smartphone leaked in live images, tipped to be the Redmi Note 4X By -   Redmi Note 4X will purportedly sport 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 4,100mAh battery” \nSeveral reports in the past have suggested that Xiaomi is working on a successor to the Redmi Note 4 smartphone. Allegedly dubbed the Redmi Note 4X, the phone was recently spotted on the Chinese certification agency TENAA with specs and images. Now popular Chinese gadget tipster @ kjuma has posted a couple of alleged live images of the Redmi Note 4X. \nThe design of the Redmi Note 4X in the new images is slightly different from what we saw at TENAA last month. The positioning of the fingerprint sensor has shifted from the rear to the home button. The device appears to have a metal unibody design and sports a silver hue. \nAs per the earlier reports, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X will offer 4GB of RAM, and will be available in 32GB and 64GB storage variants. It will be powered by either a MediaTek Helio X20 SoC or a Snapdragon 653 processor. The device will be fuelled by a 4,100mAh battery. There’s no word on when the company is planning to launch the phone at the moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:39:18.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
