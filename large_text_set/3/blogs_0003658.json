Giaco says the build was a test for another project where he hopes to build a lethal Nerf gun.\nThis is definitely the World’s most powerful and fastest Nerf Dart ever shot.\nI’m in the process to build a LETHAL Nerf Gun. But first I built a Nerf Cannon to test out what kind of damage just a normal Nerf Dart can do if shot at super high speed. Well, the result it’s pretty scary actually… I was able to pierce all the way through a Red Bull can with NO PROBLEM what so ever!\n\nRelated Laughing Squid Posts Engineers Build a Giant Functional Nerf Gun That Can Fire Projectiles Up to 130 Yards The View From a GoPro Camera Being Fired Out of a Powerful Air Cannon A Drone Mounted With a Nerf Disc Gun Dogfights Inside of an Empty Warehouse ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:14:16.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
