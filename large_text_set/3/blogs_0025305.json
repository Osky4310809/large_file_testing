Playing off Carlie Wittman’s love of Doritos, he showed up to her house wearing a shirt that said: \n“I know I’m NACHO typical Dorito but… I’m going to be CHEESY and ask: Will you go to prom with me?” \nHe even brought her a bag of her favorite snack and beautiful roses. That was enough to make her squeal with delight and say “yes,” of course. \nShaedon said he didn’t do it for the publicity, but “to make her happy.” \n“She deserves a lot,” he said. “Anyone who’s ever around her, she makes them laugh. She always has a smile on her face. She’s amazing,” \nShaedon sent out a sweet tweet, too: Can’t wait for prom with this sweet gal pic.twitter.com/z3Lc66YRW3 \n— Shaedon Wedel (@shardonwedel) March 17, 2017 \nClick CONTINUE to see a video of this precious moment:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:52:46.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
