Seguridad Ciudadana Chimbote \nThey quickly realized that the dogs refused to be parted from the wounded man’s side, so they decided it would be easier to bring him with him. After the man was carried into an ambulance, the dogs hopped inside too. \nA video of the event shows that that the dogs rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. (Note: the video below may take a few seconds to load.) \nThey also accompanied him into the hospital. \nSeguridad Ciudadana Chimbote shared photos of one of the dogs resting on the gurney next to his human as care workers look him over. Seguridad Ciudadana Chimbote \nPhotos posted to Facebook later in the day by a hospital intern show the man in a wheelchair with his dogs still by his side. \nEjemplo de lealtad… Los pacientes del día \nPosted by Joha Morillas Zapata on Monday, December 26, 2016 \n“Example of loyalty,” Joha Morillas Zapata wrote. “The patients of the day.” \nIt seems that the man is on the mend, no doubt, in part thanks to the loving support of his faithful friends. \nShare this heartwarming story with your family and friends.
