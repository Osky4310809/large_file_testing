The tone of Seehofer’s remarks appears to re-consolidate their alliance, but the main stumbling block still remain, as the CDU and CSU seek to find consensus over Germany’s migrant policy. \nThe CSU leader again criticized Merkel’s open-door policy, which allowed over 1 million of migrants into Germany since mid-2015. With elections looming, Seehofer attacked the Chancellor’s refugee policy, claiming that it only helps the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and is “only going to make the AfD stronger.” Read more Germany to speed up repatriation of failed Tunisian asylum seekers – Merkel \nThe debate over Germany’s migrant policy was re-ignited after the attack in Berlin, when a refugee of Tunisian origins rammed a truck into a Christmas fair killing 12 people and injuring 56 others. After the attack, Merkel’s interior minister proposed a number of measures to tighten security, such as centralizing Germany’s security agencies. Currently, each of the 16 German federal states has its own. \n“We have an obligation to the victims and those affected [by the Berlin terrorist attack] as well as to the whole nation to rethink and reshape our whole immigration and security policy,” Seehofer said in the aftermath of the attack as cited by Die Welt daily. \nSeehofer has rejected the interior ministry’s proposal and in December called for the powers for the domestic intelligence agencies and police forces to be expanded instead. The CSU has circulated a document entitled, “Security for our Freedom,” which was reportedly to be discussed at the party’s retreat.The party wants security forces to arrest migrants who potentially pose a “public danger” and expel them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:26:34.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
