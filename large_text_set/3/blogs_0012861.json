But what is a major policy shift is that now it will also include screening non-communicable diseases and a whole lot of other aspects,\" a senior official said. \nThe source said that under the new policy, there will also be a bigger focus on upgradation of district hospitals while for the first time, there will be an implementation framework in place. \nThe proposed National Health Policy aims to provide assured health services to people as an \"entitlement\". \nThe Cabinet note which had been given earlier, however, had not talked about making health a \"fundamental right\" as it will have \"legal consequences\" but proposed assured health services. \nThe draft also addressed the issues of universal health coverage as well as making drugs and diagnostics available free at least in the public healthcare system of the country. \nThe policy also seeks to reduce maternal and infant mortality rate and address increasing burden of non communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disorders. \nIt suggests the Centre must amend laws to align them with the current healthcare scenario. \nIt is said that a final decision on the policy had been deferred earlier after it was included in the agenda of the Union Cabinet twice before. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, March 16, 2017 - 09:10 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T05:57:41.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
