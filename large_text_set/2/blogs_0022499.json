Ayodele Fayose \nGovernor Fayose’s Special Assistant on Public Communications and New Media, Lere Olayinka, quoted the governor as saying in a release issued in Ado Ekiti yesterday that it was worrisome that INEC and the Police are no longer hiding their alliance with the APC against Nigerians. \nHis words: “We have seen the police and INEC going back and forth on Rivers State rerun elections and I wish to ask the police; what happened to that suspect, Christian Chukwuemeka Ejikeme, who reportedly confessed to the complicity of some APC top-shots in the murder of DSP Mohammed Alkali? \n“Shouldn’t the police be more interested in bringing those who allegedly killed its officers to justice? \n“Also, what has happened to that Yobe State INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) established to have received N15 million bribe to rig the Yobe State election?” \nFayose, who is also the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors Forum, warned that any attempt to rig the 2018 governorship election in Ekiti State will be resisted by the people, saying; “Here in Ekiti, we are waiting for them. If INEC and its ally, APC like, they can print as many Form EC8A as it can, they will fail.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:28:35.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
