The show -- which ended up spinning off two other sitcoms, Rhoda and Phyllis , as well as the drama series Lou Grant -- came to an end in 1977. But Moore got a chance to reconnect with her former Mary Tyler Moore Show cohorts Valerie Harper, Betty White, Cloris Leachman and Georgia Engel in 2002 for a very special reunion, and ET was on set for an exciting look at the icon at work. WATCH: Dick Van Dyke Mourns Mary Tyler Moore's Death: 'There Are No Words' For the long-awaited reunion, Moore -- who died on Wednesday at the age of 80 after going into cardiopulmonary arrest -- wanted to make sure that the special was satisfying and truly meaningful for longtime fans of her celebrated series. \"I wanted to have a sense of who the people who played those characters are,\" Moore told ET at the time. The day ET came to the set, the energy was electric and it was clear that there was nothing but love between the actresses, who Moore said rarely got a chance to be around each other.

While Moore's relationship with Harper, Leachman and Engel remained strong over the years, perhaps her closest friend from the groundbreaking sitcom was White. The two actresses had undeniable comedic chemistry on the show, and off-screen, also shared an unshakeable bond.
