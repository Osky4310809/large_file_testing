In August 2016, the quadruple amputee underwent a transplant operation to receive his two new arms at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, according to ABC News . \n“Every day I look down at [my] new arms, I will drive on through the pain and I will never give up,” said Peck in October, the first time he publicly spoke about the transplant. \nSince then, Peck, who says he and his wife have been “living out of a suitcase for the last five months,” has been undergoing months of rigorous physical therapy in order to gain control of his new arms. Dr. David Crandell, the amputee program medical director at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Network in Boston, credited Peck’s background as a Marine for the intensity and drive he brought to his rehab. \nFor Peck, the hard work of his rehab means not just being able to live a normal life, but also getting closer to accomplishing a goal. In October, the quadruple amputee spoke about how his dream job since he was 12 was to become a chef, hoping to someday win Food Network’s The Next Food Network Star . When he began to wiggle his fingers last week, those same sentiments returned. \n“I started doing happy tears because I realized I’m one step closer to becoming a chef,” he told ABC News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:31:13.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
