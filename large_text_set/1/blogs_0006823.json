In his first NFL start, Cook had trouble getting anything going against the Texans’ top-ranked defense, and that created plenty of work for King.\nReally though, King was busy .\nRaiders last 7 drives\n\nPunt\nPunt\nPunt\nPunt\nPunt\nPunt\nPunt\n— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 7, 2017 The most punts that King had in a game all season was nine, and he eclipsed that in the third quarter of this one.\nMarquette King has 10 punts today. There were only 3 games in 2016 where player had 10+ pic.twitter.com/W4mED1sdHA \n— ProFootballReference (@pfref) January 8, 2017 In total, King had 10 punts for the entire game, amounting to 457 yards. One of his punts was a touchback, and two were downed inside the 20. His longest punt on the afternoon went 62 yards.\nKing also helped save the Raiders from a punt return for a touchdown, when he took contact from Whitney Mercilus, drawing a 5-yard penalty that resulted in the down being repeated.\nThe game could have been a lot worse if it wasn’t for King. He came into the game sixth in the NFL with 3,937 punting yards on the year, with a long of 72 yards, tied for fifth-best in the league. King was also fifth in the league with punts downed inside the 20 with 34. There’s a reason he was named a second-team All-Pro.\nThe Raiders lost, 27-14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T03:11:11.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
