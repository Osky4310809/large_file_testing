After a busy weekend of partying with celebrities, gaining recognition for your latest hit film, and taking home a Golden Globe for your performance in said film, sometimes you just need to take a step away from the public eye. That’s why La La Land star, Emma Stone, went incognito (while still staying chic) at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris earlier today.\nStone was traveling with La La Land costar, Ryan Gosling, both of whom donned shades, hats, and coats — the classic celebrity disguise. But being the fashionable woman Stone is , her airport-wear is truly on-point and we want to wear it every day.\nBy picking out a few key pieces, we can easily recreate Stone’s super-chic airport disguise.

Doing so in a simple wool jacket, rather than an oversized sweatshirt or North Face jacket, makes you look more put-together when you step off the plane.\nThis wool blend coat from ASOS ($89.50) will keep you toasty and is more than appropriate to wear to dinner and drinks directly after landing. ASOS One detail of Stone’s outfit that we just can’t get over is her unique felt riding hat. Everyone needs something to cover up their plane-hair, and Stone’s hat goes one step beyond the basic baseball cap. Getty Images / Marc Piasecki We found this felt riding hat from MaisonDeCoco on Etsy ($24.99). If you’re not totally down with the (real) rabbit fur pompom, you can message seller, Coco Hann, to make the pompom a removable feature. Etsy / MaisonDeCoco We also really love this wine-colored adjustable hat from HEADCANDI on Etsy ($68). The color and vintage broach definitely make this a unique piece that will keep your hair in place — yet still let people know that your fashion sense is top-notch. Etsy / HEADCANDI And finally, find yourself a great cross-body bag. Keeping your carry-on belongings close to you is important while traveling and using a cross-body bag keeps your hands free to handle other tasks at hand. Stone’s The Row Velvet Hunting Bag is perfect for the fashionable traveller. Getty Images / Marc Piasecki As for this ASOS leather cross-body bag ($43.60) , it’s the perfect size to stuff your phone, keys, tissues, headphones, etc. into, yet small enough to not get in the way of everything else. ASOS Now all you need is your favorite pair of shades and some comfy, yet stylish boots, and you’re ready to hit the tarmac à la Emma Stone!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T00:51:13.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
