And sometimes after the end of a bad relationship, your ex tries to get back together. They might give you a quick phone call, or “bump into you” on campus, or send an “I miss you” text. Sometimes, they might even write a letter. \nAnd — in this digital age — you gotta give some props to someone who takes a time to write an actual letter. And Nick Lutz did give his ex-girlfriend some credit when she wrote him one — just not full credit. \nThey broke up after Nick heard that his ex-girlfriend had been messing around with another guy. After their breakup, she wrote this letter in an effort to hopefully patch things up. However, Nick noticed some errors in the note, and he couldn’t let them go uncorrected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T18:39:48.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
