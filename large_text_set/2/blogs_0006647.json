That group met Tuesday, and Plank emerged with a glowing review of the new president. \nAnd that's where the real trouble began. \nPlank told CNBC, \"To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country. People can really grab that opportunity.\" Plank went on to praise Trump's desire to build, seemingly endorsing the plan for a wall along the Mexican border. \nStephon Curry, the face of Under Armour's basketball line, said when asked about that comment : \"I agree with that description if you remove the 'et.'\" from asset. \nSan Francisco 49ers wide receiver Torrey Smith, who remains popular in Baltimore and influential especially in the inner city, took to Twitter to express his displeasure. Very disappointed....but he spoke from a buisness perspective....if you are a Fortune 500 company I'm sure you view Trump as an asset https://t.co/ciiH1hJHRl — Torrey Smith (@TorreySmithWR) February 8, 2017 My hate for trump has never been about his buisness sense....it's been about his character and labeling of other people — Torrey Smith (@TorreySmithWR) February 8, 2017 \nEven The Rock said Plank's \"words were divisive and lacking in perspective. Inadvertently creating a situation where the personal political opinions of UA's partners and it's employees were overshadowed by the comments of its CEO.\" \nBallet star Misty Copeland also criticized her sponsor . \nAnd so Plank faces his biggest challenge yet, because the story of Under Armour - he loves to talk about the narrative of his company - has always been torn between two missions: catching Nike (and Adidas) while also presenting as the grittier, more authentic alternative to those giants. \nAppearing to align with Trump - even in one interview - threatens to reveal how fully that second goal has become a marketing ploy. As Smith notes, it's not unexpected to hear Plank say positive things about the pro-business elements of Trump's platform. But to call Trump - whose election sent millions of people into the streets for Women's Marches - an \"asset\" without any sort of qualification is baffling and tone deaf (especially since Under Armour has worked relentlessly to appeal to women in recent years). \nPlank, like Tom Brady (another Under Armour athlete and Trump supporter), tends to focus on the positive. He speaks largely in slogan and jargon, talking of bold ambition and, yes, his desire to win. And I think, in as far as he has been something of a savant in the business world, he often operates with blinders on, thinking only about how to grow the company. Plank genuinely would like to see more manufacturing jobs return to the United State's, and sees Trump's stance on de-regulation as positive. He honed in on that without considering the bigger picture. \nPlank he has generally been savvy enough to stay away from the fray of politics (his donations, for example, appear to be spread between both parties, as he gave to Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley in 2015 as they raised money for their presidential campaigns.) \nNow he has endangered the future of his company by backing a deeply divisive president. The company quickly tried to clarify, issuing a statement praising diversity and saying \"We engage in policy, not politics.\" \nSo much damage has already been done, including a social media boycott campaign like the one that caused Uber's CEO to cut ties with a Trump advisory group. \nUnder Armour embraces its role as an underdog, casting even physically gifted athletes like Cam Newton as unexpected success stories who proved haters wrong along the way. That's certainly where Curry fits in - too small and too weak to play at the next level! - and was part of the strategy behind backing Copeland with an incredible commercial showing her rise in ballet despite so many doubters. \nUnder Armour put together an astonishing group of athletes - including golfer Jordan Spieth, swimmer Michael Phelps, Mexican boxer Canelo Alvarez and baseball star Bryce Harper - and somehow made them all feel relatable by focusing on their humble origins. Those athletes - more so than the much-copied sweat-wicking technology that helped launch the brand - give Under Armour currency now. \nEven as the company grew and Plank became a billionaire, the message seemed to be clear - and even relatively authentic: Under Armour stood for determination and old-fashioned hard work, and everyone was invited. \nPraising a man born into his riches who built a campaign and the first few weeks of his presidency on restricting access for Muslims and Mexicans does seem at odds with Under Armour's carefully crafted public spirit. \nSome of the athletes paid to endorse the brand have noticed - as will young stars who Under Armour might want to sign - and their public split with Plank will make sure consumers do, too.
