Posted on Mar 22, 2017 @ 7:05AM \nIt’s the moment of truth! For years, James DeBarge has claimed that he and Janet Jackson secretly fathered a love child that was given up for adoption. And now, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal the results of a secret DNA test that will settle the story once and for all! \nThe scandal exploded last week when Radar revealed the identity of the woman the DeBarge family has claimed is the love child, Philadelphia native Tiffany Whyte . \nJames’s mother, Etterlene DeBarge , has said that she and Whyte, 31, previously took their own secret DNA test – and it was a match. So, James and Tiffany agreed to take a test for Radar in an attempt silence the skeptics forever. \nREAD The Bombshell DNA Test Report! \n“It is for sure that James and Janet are my parents,” Whyte told Radar. “I want to know the truth.” \nAs for James, 53, he said he was ready to start the next chapter – with or without Whyte. “I don’t like speculating,” he said, explaining that he was ready for the scientific verdict . \nBut if the results came back positive, he said, he was ready to welcome Whyte into the family. \n“I’m not going to push it on her,” James said. “I still don’t know what to do. I’m still kind of feeling this thing out, how to be a father to a stranger.” \nPHOTOS:Pregnant At 50! Janet Jackson Debuts Her Baby Bump \nSaid Whyte, who grew up in the Pennsylvania foster system, “I’ve been waiting for this moment for 31 years. I always wanted a father. Always wanted a dad. I would like for James to be a part of my life.” \nWhyte and James each subjected to a monitored DNA test at accredited facilities in California and Pennsylvania. After the results were analyzed by top experts in the field, Radar can reveal that James is NOT Whyte’s father! \nIndeed, the scientific report says that there is literally ZERO chance of paternity between James and Whyte. \nBut of course, that doesn’t mean the story ends here. \nJames told Michael Jackson ’s death doctor, Conrad Murray , in a 2012 prison letter that he’d had a love child with Janet – and the heir he described may still be out there. \nJames isn’t giving up the search, and he insists that the truth will come out. \n“I was a young boy who loved a girl tremendously and things happened how they did,” he said. “Janet and I were real close, but I guess not as close as I thought.” \nWill his famous ex finally comment after all these years to put the mystery to rest? Janet, 50, has largely retreated from the public eye since marrying billionaire Qatari businessman Wissam al Mana and giving birth to their son, Eissa, in January at age 50. \nPHOTOS: I’m Janet Jackson’s Secret Daughter! Meet The Woman Behind The Massive Cover-Up \nStill, James is hopeful that the truth will come out. “I don’t think you can really pull the wool over the public’s eye” forever, he said. \nWe pay for juicy info!
