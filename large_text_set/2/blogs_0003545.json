The ad presents the simple message that “we believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.” That should be a simple message, but at a time when America’s leader is making it clear he vehemently believes the opposite and is trying to change our country’s values to practice aggressive exclusion, it very much isn’t. It’s also pretty hard, then, not to view this as a message aimed directly at this current administration’s goals and practices.\nOn their company website, Airbnb published a statement explaining what this campaign is all about.\nWe believe in the simple idea that no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, you deserve to belong. We know this is an idealistic notion that faces huge obstacles because of something that also seems simple, but isn’t – that not everyone is accepted. \nPeople who’ve been displaced, whether because of war or conflict or other factors, are acutely vulnerable to not being accepted. They are, quite literally, in need of a place to belong, which is why we’ve been inspired to take action. \nAs the company itself says, this isn’t just a commercial. It’s a commitment.\n@ShaunKing #weaccept is more than just a commercial, it’s a pledge for us all to stand together.\n— Airbnb (@Airbnb) February 6, 2017 \n\nHere’s the pledge they’re making in this crucial moment in time.\nToday we’re setting a goal to provide short-term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need. We’ll start with refugees, disaster survivors, and relief workers, though we want to accommodate many more types of displaced people over time. To help people around the world facing displacement, we’ll work with our community of hosts to find not just a place to stay, but also a place to feel connected, respected, and a part of a community again. In addition, Airbnb will contribute $4 million over the course of four years to the International Rescue Committee to support the most critical needs of displaced populations globally.\nTo their credit, the letter also does not shy away from the fact that Airbnb hasn’t had the cleanest record when it comes to inclusion. They have a troubling history of racial discrimination (as well as weirdly petty responses to criticism). But the company promises that this is “something that is the very opposite of our values,” and that they’re working to bring that “We Accept” mission into their own practices.\n(image via screengrab)\nWant more stories like this?
