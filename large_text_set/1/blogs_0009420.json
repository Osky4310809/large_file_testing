Daniuska Rodriguez (Photo: YouTube/FIFATV) \nVenezuela won the Womenâ€™s U-17 Sudamericano Championship, and they had Rodriguez to thank. She scored six goals in the tournament, but it was her incredible individual effort against Colombia which caught everyone's attention... and a Puskas Award nomination. Mohd Faiz Subri (Photo: YouTube/FIFATV) \nA free-kick? In the Puskas Awards? Just wait till you see it. In the Malaysian Super League Subri smacks a free-kick so bendy it makes Papiss Cisse's volley against Chelsea look tame. If this effort wins, we take full credit for our outstanding coverage of it last tear. \nYou can of course vote officially for your favourite on the Fifa website here . But you can also vote unofficially in our poll below. poll loading Who should the 2016 Puskas Award? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T15:03:42.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
