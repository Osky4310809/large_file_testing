On Tuesday, Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical reported Erving was hired as a head coach for one of the league's eight teams. The news was confirmed by the league in a release that read in part, \"The professional 3-on-3 league has announced another big name acquisition with the signing of the legendary Julius 'Dr. J' Erving as a coach,\" via Jack Maloney of CBS Sports. He is far from the only notable BIG3 coach. According to Ben Rohrbach of Yahoo Sports, Hall of Famers Allen Iverson , Rick Barry, Clyde Drexler, George Gervin and Gary Payton will also serve as coaches in the three-on-three league that was founded by Ice Cube. Rohrbach noted Iverson will be a player-coach and captain one of the teams. Each team will have co-captains who will complete their rosters during April's draft. The list of co-captains already includes Chauncey Billups, Kenyon Martin, Rashard Lewis, Jermaine O'Neal, Mike Bibby, Jason Williams as well as other former NBA players. The BIG3 recently announced it will start its season June 25 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York: BIG3 @thebig3 3/12/2017, 10:44:51 PM Per a release on the league's official website , Brooklyn is the first stop during a 10-week season, with four games taking place in one venue on the same day. While there are already a number of notable names included in Ice Cube's venture, the addition of Erving represents basketball royalty. The Hall of Famer was a 16-time All-Star and led the 1982-83 Philadelphia 76ers to a title alongside Moses Malone. He was also known for his head-turning dunks and style on the floor, which are traits that would play well for BIG3 fans if he can instill them in his team as a coach.
