Police say the teen then slammed the officer to the ground, which caused him to hit his head.\nPolice say the teen also fits the description of a suspect who robbed a 7-Eleven at gunpoint early Sunday morning.\nThis embed is invalid\nChief Inspector Scott Small says, “Not only is this individual going to be charged with assault on police, but Northeast is looking in to the possibility he may have committed this robbery at point of gun.”\nOfficers were able to find the teen about 20 minutes later hiding behind one of the businesses, but they have not found a gun.\nPolice and K9s are now combing the area looking for the weapon.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:27:00.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
