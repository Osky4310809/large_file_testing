Most canonically, this season we’ll get to the famous shower scene that made Hitchcock’s original one of the scariest horror films ever made, when Marion Crane finally checks into a room at the Bates. And who better to play an iconic scream queen than Robyn Rihanna Fenty? \nRihanna assumes Janet Leigh’s own iconic turn in this first trailer as a rain-soaked stranger in an improbable velvet cloak (on one hand, who wears a velvet cloak in a rainstorm? on the other: Rihanna). Though it’s just a tiny snippet of the Norman peeping-tom storyline which we all know will end with Marion Crane butcher-knifed in a steaming, bloody, swirling shower, the anticipation is great! Here’s another teaser to tide you over for the next few weeks: Rihanna as Crane, eyeing someone or something quizzically, in the pouring rain (in a freaking velvet cloak)!
