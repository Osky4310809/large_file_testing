Is Kamal Haasan anti-Hindu, does he even know what he is talking about? While the actor's large fan base has been widely appreciative of his pro-activeness on social media, the latest one is not acceptable. By: Manika Gupta | New Delhi | Updated: March 26, 2017 2:21 PM Kamal Haasan. (PTI) \nKamal Haasan loves to be in controversies. Perhaps, that is his way of stealing the limelight. But attacking Draupadi as being a pawn is against the dignity of Indian women. In an acerbic interview he to a regional channel he said that the country reads a book in which a woman referring to Draupadi was used as a pawn and was gambled away.This is a direct dig and obviously cannot be taken lightly. \nWhile the actor’s large fan base has been widely appreciative of his pro-activeness on social media, the latest one is not acceptable. Even though some would say that we have freedom of speech in this country, we cannot abuse our freedom. We need to exercise the freedom with responsibility. \nAlso watch: \nThe comment is unwarranted. Clearly, he is misusing his freedom of speech. As He lives in a majority Hindu country and has no business to comment on a mythological figure that Hindus have respect for. Kamal Hasan has forgotten the context and the times in which Draupadi lived. Mahabharata is one of the most time-tested epics in the world, it is modern in its context. Not that Kamal Haasan talking against will take away the credit that Mahabharat has but he has no business to pronounce such judgments. \nHe is not only inciting enmity between the two groups but also forgetting that his own religion has instances of worst condition of women. He should focus on triple talaq and issues like that rather than bothering about one-off reference in the Mahabharata. Only if he could mind his own business! \nAlso watch: \nLet’s hope the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed against Haasan in the Tirunelveli district court by Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) for hurting the sentiments of Hindus is heard and verdict granted against Kamal Haasan. \nEarlier, police had also lodged a complaint against Haasan by Hindu Makkal Katchi on March 15 at the Chennai City Police Commissionerate for his alleged derogatory remarks about Mahabharata.
