The Los Angeles Times reports that the man with the pepper spray, dressed in black with a mask, attacked first after which pro-Trump demonstrators fought back by tackling, punching and kicking the man. \nSocial media captured the confrontations: Violence erupting at Trump rally when pro and anti Trump protestors collide. #MAGAMARCH in Huntington Beach pic.twitter.com/MDxGhX2GoO \n— Cindy Carcamo (@theCindyCarcamo) March 25, 2017 Man in black mask chased onto PCH, marchers said he pepper sprayed them #MAGAMARCH in #HuntingtonBeach pic.twitter.com/ZPNWJaVYol \n— Ben Brazil (@benbrazilpilot) March 25, 2017 Absolute unrest at the #MAGAmarch , anti-Trump protestors defending themselves while being ganged up on by Trump supporters. pic.twitter.com/7c8xu0J7N3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:47:46.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
