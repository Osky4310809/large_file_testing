After all, everyone needs cash for life’s essentials.\nHowever, this social experiment proves that some people will go out of their way to help others even when they have very little themselves.\nYouTube creator Johal  set up a scenario in which a homeless man was given some money whilst he slept on a bench. When he woke, he immediately went to buy some much-needed groceries. However, when he overheard a man next to him talking on the phone about his inability to buy medicine for his daughter, he told his new acquaintance to wait.\nThe homeless man chose to return his new groceries and, in an amazing show of generosity, offer the refunded money to the anxious father so that he could help his sick child.\nThis video is an awesome reminder that it isn’t how much money you have that counts, it’s what you choose to do with it and your determination to lend assistance to others.\nFeatured photo credit: Johal via youtube.com \nThe post Homeless Man Is Given Money While He Sleeps, What He Does Next Is Super Touching appeared first on Lifehack .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T10:18:48.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
