It was learnt that a large number of the insurgents, who attacked the Mi-17 helicopter, were repelled by the soldiers, and many of them died in an air strike. The Boko Haram members reportedly laid ambush in Gwoza on Wednesday and thereafter attacked the NAF helicopter which was on a medical outreach to the Internally Displaced Persons’ camp in Gwoza. The NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Group Captain Ayodele Famuyiwa, confirmed the incident, adding that the air strike nullified scores of the insurgents. He said, “Our helicopter conveying personnel on medical outreach programme at Gwoza came under attack by members of the Boko Haram terrorists group. The Mi-17 helicopter was shot at several times by the insurgents. However, there was no casualty except for an airman that sustained bullet wound. “The helicopter had departed from Maiduguri enroute the venue of a two-day medical outreach programme in Gwoza when it came under attack by the insurgents. Nevertheless, the pilot was able to fly the helicopter safely to and from its destination to enable the outreach programme to continue uninterrupted. “Following the attack, the NAF immediately scrambled a fighter aircraft and helicopter gunship to the location between Bama and Gwoza to neutralise the threat. Intelligent report by ground troops confirmed scores of the terrorists were killed, signifying that the air attack on the threat location was successful.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:02:41.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
