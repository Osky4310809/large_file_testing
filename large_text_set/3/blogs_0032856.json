Have Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon already patched up? Find out here... By Pooja Nayak | Published: March 31, 2017 12:02 pm Sushant Singh Rajput, Shruti Haasan, Emraan Hasmi: Celebs spotted at the airport \nWe were the first one to EXCLUSIVELY break the news of Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon’s breakup. Our sources had revealed to us how Sushant’s mood swings and Kriti’s growing clinginess was the reason behind their split as the couple realised they are not meant to be together. In fact, some even blamed Sushant’s casanova image behind Kriti choosing to move out of his life. While it’s left to see if Sushant and Kriti will mutually make peace considering they are yet to promote their upcoming film Raabta. Latest buzz suggests how Sushant is now trying hard to reconcile with Kriti for the sake of the film’s promotions. Yes..

Now we dunno if the two have put an end to their differences or no but if at all this report is true then it’s interesting to see how Sushant is going out of his way for Raabta. As per a Mirror report, the producers of the film too are now trying their best to intervene and sort things out between Kriti and Sushant because they obviously don’t want to divert the attention from Raabta to Sushant and Kriti’s breakup. \nWill Kriti let bygones be bygones and get back to Sushant for the sake of the film? Or is it over between the two once and for all? We dunno what destiny holds for Sushant and Kriti but we’re worried for Raabta, which happens to be Sushant and Kriti’s first film together. The last we saw Sushant and Kriti together was during Manish Malhotra’s birthday bash after which, both gradually started making solo appearances together with Sushant also sporting a ‘comfortably single’ tee at Karan Johar’s single’s bash this Valentine’s Day. \nKeep watching this space for more updates on this hot story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T10:32:48.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
