As I have told the DSS and the Police, my constituents brought the information to me.” \nand they bring me all kinds of information regarding their experiences and what is going on, and it is my duty to evaluate them. \n“I have not behaved inappropriately as I have sufficient information to support my claim that my constituents duly reported to me and indeed informed me that an unidentified helicopter usually land in Ovre’ Eku/Abraka axis and it was not a classified report and that is why I refused to jeopardize the information. \n“On a final note, it is based on the above premise that I urge the security agencies to properly investigate the activities of Presco Plc and the criminal elements of the herdsmen and bring those of them culpable of any criminality to book.” \nThe police in its statement, pointed that Ovre-Abraka is a forest reserve area temporarily inhabited by a minimal number of herdsmen, who have been living peacefully with the community and enjoined members of the public to ignore the baseless information and continue to live peacefully with one another.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:18:17.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
