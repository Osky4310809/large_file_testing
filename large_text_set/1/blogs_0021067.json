Instead of having government monopoly, we now have monopoly in the private sector. \n“For instance, if you want power in Benin, it is not that you have an option. There is only one Disco in Benin, only one Disco in Lagos, only one DISCO in Abuja. You don’t have other DISCOs to compete with, you only have one. \n“So, if they tell you the rate is N100, it is N100 that is my problem. Two, if there is going to be an increase, I am familiar with increase of 3%, 5% annually. I am not favour as a Nigerian citizen of a 200 percent increase, the same way I am not in favour of a 200 percent increase in petroleum or any product. \n“Nigerians are suffering enough and because Nigerians are suffering, I cannot in good conscience say to the average consumer of power in the village you are going to have a 300 percent increase and the argument they make is that it is the only way there would be power.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:02:11.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
