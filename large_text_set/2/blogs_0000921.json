Stewart is currently back in the U.S. rehabbing a knee injury she sustained while playing in China. While in LA, Stewart took an opportunity to go to the recent protest at LAX regarding the travel ban put into place late last week. The ban currently keeps refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim countries from entering the U.S. at LAX airport.\n“I have been following the news closely and just felt compelled to join. I think we will look back on this moment and remember where we were and I wanted to be on the right side on history.” Stewart told Excelle Sports .\nMy first protest was really inspiring - to be alongside such a diverse group of people who care about other humans! #NoMuslimBan #LAX pic.twitter.com/mrLyHwy7De \n— Breanna Stewart (@bre_stewart30) January 30, 2017 Stewart also said, “I am still learning about all the issues, but believe fundamentally that when you have a voice, it’s important to use it for good. With great privilege, comes great responsibility and I understand the need for people who can speak up to do so. It’s important to stand up for what is right.”\nWhile the WNBA has many international players, many players also travel overseas to play in the offseason. The WNBA has not made an official statement, but Stewart’s team, the Seattle Storm, did.\npic.twitter.com/YRj3GdiIWE \n— Seattle Storm (@seattlestorm) January 30, 2017 This isn’t the first time Stewart has spoken up about civil rights issues. Stewart recently was one of many athletes to sign an open letter to FIBA regarding its hijab ban. Stewart also participated in the Black Lives Matter protest, along with many other WNBA teams last season.\n\"There comes a time when silence is betrayal\" -MLK @wnba #WewillNOTbesilenced #Blacklivesmatter \nA photo posted by Breanna Stewart (@bre_stewart30) on Jul 22, 2016 at 4:25pm PDT \nOther WNBA players have participated in marches lately, including Briann January of the Indiana Fever.
