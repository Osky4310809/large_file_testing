He also is accused of a crime of violence, a sentencing enhancer. \nProsecutors allege Sandoval fired shots at the Player’s Club security guards out of a passenger-side window. He is due in court for a preliminary hearing Feb. 1 and was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail. \nAccording to an arrest affidavit for Sandoval, he and Hinojos, along with a third man, drove to the strip club after a night of drinking and clubbing in Denver. Witnesses say the trio had been told to leave the property, and the three became upset as they drove off. They returned with a rifle, the affidavit says, opening fire. \nIn the Acura, investigators say they found .22-caliber shell casings and a rifle of the same caliber. The vehicle had several bullet holes, the affidavit says, including one in the right rear passenger-side window. \nSandoval and a third man in the vehicle were apprehended shortly after the shooting by an armed security guard from the strip club, according to the affidavit.
