And Ed Sheeran was also there (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n\"He couldn’t be bothered with it.” \nMeanwhile, Brooklyn turns 18 tomorrow on 4 March, and, to mark his son’s birthday, David took to Instagram to share an embarrassing baby photo. \nIn the old photo, baby Brooklyn sits in the bath with a fluffy white beard made out of bubbles.
