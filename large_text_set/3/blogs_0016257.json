One hand out front for a nice handshake with Mister Trump. His other hand is behind your back, stabbing you. Thanks for the photo, though.

The Trump administration’s proposed budget would completely eliminate federal money that supports more than 50,000 HBCU students and would slash funding for Pell Grants used by HBCU students, moves that are supported by Trump’s education secretary, who is also committed to undermining funding for the public schools that educate most incoming HBCU students. Nice photo, though. Photo: AP \nIn January, a group of union leaders posed with Trump in the Oval Office, and walked out gushing about the respect he showed them. The Trump administration has already abolished workers safety and fair pay laws, advocated for national “Right to Work” legislation that would devastate unions, explicitly called for lower wages for average workers, and nominated a Labor Secretary who wants to roll back all union gains of the past eight years. Virtually all of his policies are antithetical to the interests of most workers that most unions represent or should hope to represent. Nice photo, though.

Nice photos, though.

Maybe that one is too easy. Advertisement \nStop signing up to be ripped off.
