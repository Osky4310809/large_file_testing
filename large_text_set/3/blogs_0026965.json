Devin Nunes shocked the country on Wednesday when he announced that there was “incidental collection” of conversations of Trump aides and possibly President Donald Trump himself by the administration of President Barack Obama. \nFox is now confirming that Nunes’ information came from multiple sources. \nFrom Fox News:   \nClassified intelligence showing incidental collection of Trump team communications, purportedly seen by committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and described by him in vague terms at a bombshell Wednesday afternoon news conference, came from multiple sources, Capitol Hill sources told Fox News. The intelligence corroborated information about surveillance of the Trump team that was known to Nunes, sources said, even before President Trump accused his predecessor of having wiretapped him in a series of now-infamous tweets posted on March 4.   \n‘Incidental collection’ means that someone else, a foreign person, is the target, but the conversations of American citizens happened to be captured.   \nInformation of American citizens cannot be captured without a warrant. \nThe proper process is that if the information involves an American citizen, it is supposed to be destroyed or the name masked. \nBut, as Nunes indicated, it wasn’t. \nNot only that, but Fox is saying there is a “smoking gun” showing that the purpose of the collection was actually to surveil the Trump team, using “incidental collection” as a cover.   \nThis is a tremendous revelation, if true.   \nThe intelligence is said to leave no doubt the Obama administration, in its closing days, was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect Trump, according to sources.   \nThe key to that conclusion is the unmasking of selected U.S. persons whose names appeared in the intelligence, the sources said, adding that the paper trail leaves no other plausible purpose for the unmasking other than to damage the incoming Trump administration. \nAs Nunes noted, the FBI hasn’t complied with document requests but the NSA has. It’s what’s in the NSA response that may nail the case. \nThe FBI hasn’t been responsive to the House Intelligence Committee’s request for documents, but the National Security Agency is expected to produce documents to the committee by Friday. The NSA document production is expected to produce more intelligence than Nunes has so far seen or described – including what one source described as a potential “smoking gun” establishing the spying. \nNunes said that what he saw was “inappropriate” and “troubling.” \nThat may be the understatement of all time. \nIf true, this is going to hit like a bomb and blow up on Obama and the Democrats. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:02:38.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
