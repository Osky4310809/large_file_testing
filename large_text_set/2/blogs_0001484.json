The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

The mosque, the only one in the town, opened in 2000. \n\"This community is wonderful. They all came together. Every creed, every faith, every race,\" said Hashmi, adding that churches and an office also offered their space for the Muslim congregation to worship. \nMore than $1 million has been raised through GoFundMe to help with the reconstruction of the Islamic center, which Hashmi said is already underway. He said they've now returned to the property and are using a mobile structure for their services. \nWatch the interview above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:29:43.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
