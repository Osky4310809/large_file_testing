In other words, it's a sort of hybrid between Badoo and Chatroulette. Users can go from one conversation to another, seeing other users on their Android terminal. If you like someone, you can continue talking with them. On the other hand, if someone rubs you the wrong way you can jump immediately to the next conversation. One of the problems with AZAR - Random Video Chat is that in order to meet people of the opposite sex, you have to pay money. Only seeing profiles of people of the same sex is free, which means that if a guy is interested in women, he'll have to get out his wallet. Which is normal, in other settings. AZAR - Random Video Chat is an interesting alternative to the same old flirting apps, such as Badoo or Meetic, since it suggests using a video conference instead of looking at photos and reading a little bit about the other person.
