She was a hero to me and my brothers. She was a hero to all New York City,” Jose said.\nArroyo’s horrific death left her family in shocked disbelief, but the five sons told The Post they took comfort in knowing she was widely beloved.\n“She was the hardest working woman I ever met,” said Jose, who rushed to Jacobi Medical Center after the disaster, but his mother was pronounced dead.\n“Her spirit was already gone. I held her hands. I kissed her a lot. I told her I loved her a lot,” he continued.\nIsaiah Negron, Arroyo’s youngest son Richard Harbus Arroyo’s death will bring the brothers closer, Jose said; “We are sticking together. We are staying strong for each other — especially for the little one.”\nMeanwhile, Isaiah bravely gathered himself, and remembered his mom.\n“I love my mom,” he told The Post. “We did fun things together. We went to the circus. We went to the movies — “SpongeBob [Sponge] Out of Water” — and we laughed.”\nEdgar Montes, 22, said he’ll draw strength from his mom’s EMT partner, Monique Williams, also a close friend of the family. Williams was on duty with Arroyo and witnessed the horror when 25-year-old Jose Gonzalez commandeered their ambulance and crushed Arroyo under its wheels.\nEdgar hugged Williams tightly at the station house Saturday after the Stephen Siller Tunnel To Towers Foundation announced its donation.\n“There were not words I could say, but she felt the energy when we hugged,” he said.\n“I think she can tell me things my mom wanted to tell me.”\nThe third oldest son, Kenneth Robles, 19, remembered his mom as upbeat and optimistic: “Her attitude was always positive.”\nRobles also recalled her simple pleasures.\n“She loved ‘Law and Order,’ and she loved Pepsi. She drank it all the time.”\nArroyo’s son Justin Robles Richard Harbus Arroyo’s fourth son, Justin Robles, 16, cried when he heard the tragic news, saying his mother was “so young.”\n“She was my life,” he said. “We had a good relationship — talking, texting every day.”\nHe added, “I worried about her. Sometimes she would get a call and I wondered what would happen next.”\nArroyo’s uncle, David Malave, said she had dreamed of becoming an EMT long before joining the FDNY 14 years ago.\n“She loved helping others, so I think that was her way of giving back to the community,” Malave said. “She was the most giving, most beautiful, humble person that you can ever meet.”\nArroyo loved going on cruises, he added. She had traveled to Europe, and was thinking about going to Cuba.\n“I told her there’s a cruise that goes to Cuba and she said, ‘I want to go and meet the people.’”\nFriends came to Arroyo’s home on Creston Avenue — the same street where Gonzalez lived — to pay their respects. Yuriel Murray, 20, who grew up playing with the older brothers, recalled a charismatic Arroyo lighting up the block.\n“She was always smiling — always,” Murray said. “Any time there was a problem on the block, she was the one who would try and help.”\nSEE ALSO \nEx-con charged with killing EMT has troubled, violent past 0:0 The ex-con accused of fatally mowing down a Bronx FDNY... Arroyo’s accused killer, Gonzalez, was locked up in Rikers Island without bail, charged with murder, manslaughter and robbery .\nPreliminary tests indicate that Gonzalez — whose lawyer described him as severely mentally ill — had marijuana and PCP, also known as “Angel Dust,” a drug that causes hallucinations, delirium, and mania, in his system, police sources said.\nGonzalez’s rap sheet includes 31 arrests — all but 10 in sealed court records — going back to when he was a juvenile. The charges include assault, sale and possession of marijuana; criminal trespass for jumping a subway gate without paying and public lewdness for masturbating on a Manhattan street.\nHe’s also been taken into custody at least six times as an “emotionally disturbed person” and taken to hospitals for evaluation, sources said.\nGonzalez — whose nickname was “Breezy” — lived alone at the Creston Avenue Residence, which provides housing and social services for veterans and the homeless.\nA resident who asked not to be named said Gonzalez, who “sometimes got a little loud,” had been sent to St. Barnabas Hospital for psychiatric treatment.\nWhen the cops came and frisked him, “he would freak out,” the tenant said, adding that his behavior had gotten “progressively worse” since he moved in several years ago.\n“Most definitely, he slipped through the cracks,” the tenant said.\nThe FDNY announced Saturday that a wake for Arroyo will be held from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday and Friday at Joseph A. Lucchese Funeral Home in The Bronx. Her funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. March 25 at St. Nicholas of Tolentine Roman Catholic Church, also in The Bronx.\nAdditional reporting by Joe Parziale, Stephanie Pagones and Larry Celona \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T02:52:42.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
