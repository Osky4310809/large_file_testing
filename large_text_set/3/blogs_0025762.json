While recently discussing the series with The New York Times , the cover star for Vogue 's April issue opened up about why the project hits so close to home . \"I think [Asher] understood that I knew what it meant to be bullied. I went to the biggest high school in the world, which is the Disney Channel and my mom had a lot of history dealing with [bullying]. I heard her stories growing up. She's very open about it.\"\nDespite being the most followed person on Instagram , Selena also revealed she still deals with haters on the social media app. \"I delete the app from my phone at least once a week. You fixate on the [negative] ones. It's like they want to cut to your soul. Imagine all the insecurities that you already feel about yourself and having someone write a paragraph pointing out every little thing â€” even if it's just physical.\" 13 Reasons Why will be available to stream on March 31!\nImage Source: Getty / Angela Weiss", "external_links": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-i-was-bullied-during-my-disney-channel-days-w473337", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/CTUyqKPHkEFC_Yq2FxUQ2oOPxSo/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/22/198/n/1922398/6322797c98b2aceb_GettyImages-509834164.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-23T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T06:23:32.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
