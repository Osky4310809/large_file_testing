(Many stalkers do not have fixed addresses and cannot be served, meaning the order never goes into effect.)\nWhat’s next up for the activist? Claire said she has a deal for her own TV show.\n“The concept for my show would be to help [stalking] victims in every episode, and really explore these crimes and ideally act as an advertisement for why we need these laws,” she explained. “Non-celebrities rarely go public when they are being stalked for fear of the repercussions, which is why there is little understanding of the nature of these crimes. I want to change that.”\nFor the more on Claire’s story and efforts to better protect victims, visit her personal site and her nonprofit, VERSE .\nWe pay for juicy info!
