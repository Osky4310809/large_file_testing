Just then, we saw a vehicle carrying five passengers. \n“We came out when it got to the bridge, pounced on the passengers and took them into our boats. They were three women and two men. \n“We headed to our camp and kept them for five days. It was while we were at the camp that we discovered that one of them was a policewoman.” \nHe said it was after they collected N200,000 from the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Ketu and an additional N300,000 from the police woman’s family that they released her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T07:43:28.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
