I called the doorman to get me out. I thought I’d be trapped for days. \n“No one took the call, so I called the police.” \nLloyd refused to press charges but officers took Jocelyn away and charged her with assault. \nShe said: “Lloyd did not want to press charges but they took one look at his face, and I was arrested.” \nHer mugshot and fingerprints were taken and, when she returned to their New York penthouse in the Trump World Tower, fashion designer Lloyd had moved out.

Christmas was coming and, of course, people’s thoughts turn to family at the time, as did Jocelyn’s. \n“Emotions were running high. The fact she’s been cut out of the estate and not seeing her children was all too much.” \nJocelyn, also known as the Bride of Wildenstein, became the world’s most infamous divorcee after landing a £2billion settlement from ex-husband Alec Wildenstein, with £80million a year for the first 13 years and £90,000 a month thereafter. \nBut the judge ruled she could not use any of the cash for further cosmetic surgery.

So eager was she to keep him happy that she reportedly began undergoing facial surgery to look more feline to please him. \nAt one point they had “his and her eyelifts”, and spent an estimated £1million a month on jewellery and designer clothes, including £220,000 Chanel dresses. \nWaited on hand and foot by more than 350 staff, Jocelyn never learned to boil a kettle and had no idea how to switch on her own oven. \nBut after 19 years of marriage she found Wildenstein in bed with 21-year-old Russian model Yelena Jarikova.

He spent a night in jail and, on his release, he issued divorce proceedings – sparking one of the most bitter disputes in matrimonial history. \nThe case caused a reported rift between Alec and their children after he cut off Jocelyn’s phone and credit cards, slashed her £120,000 monthly allowance to £40,000 and fired her accountant. \nCruelly, Alec, who died aged 67 in 2008, then criticised her plastic surgery, denying he was behind it. \nHe said: “She was crazy. I’d always find out last. She thought she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin doesn’t work that way. But she wouldn’t listen.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:57:25.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
