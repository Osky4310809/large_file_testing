Can’t just ask a girl on a date and show up to her front door with some flowers and a button down shirt. That shit is wayyyy played out. Need to make a splash, need to really impress her – need to do something on the internet and go viral. \n\nEnter – the dating resume from Michigan State junior Joseph A. Adams, Lubricants Consultant. \n\n\nSolid GPA. Solid internship = solid career opportunity in a burgeoning industry. People forget oil is very lucrative. \n\n\n“Religious functions” concerns me. Anybody whose chart of their time spent features that much religious functioning is a big red flag for me. Almost much of a red flag as making a dating resume. \n\n\n\nIf you don’t cry during Marley & Me you’re a psychopath, sociopath, all the paths, so that’s a good sign. \nMy dude spent more time on this dating resume trying to get a formal date than I have for any job at any point in my life. Pure dedication to trying to get to a formal. \nOh, and the best part about this story? \nThe dude didn’t get the date. \nNever even got to meet the girl. \n\nSadly, Adams’ didn’t get the date, even though he was — in his words — “DTF (down to formal).” In fact, he never even wound up meeting the girl. \n“Ashley informed me that the mysterious suitor has since asked another guy to formal. I never actually talked with the girl who originally needed a date, just Ashley, who originally made the Facebook post,” he said. \nAshley Harrington told BuzzFeed News that she “was definitely rooting for Joe to be chosen!” [ Buzzfeed News ] \n\nSomething to add to the Experience section: Getting cucked.
