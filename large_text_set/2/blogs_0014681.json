LG made the announcement today in a Korean press release, along with a few other details regarding the camera technology of its new flagship.\nThe dual rear cameras will be capable of producing shots with a 125-degree field of view while the front camera will provide a 100-degree field of view (though the front camera’s resolution is yet to be specified).\n\n \nLG also notes that G6 owners would be able to take 360-degree panorama shots, produce GIFs from photos and use a “square camera” mode to take photos immediately ready to be shared on Instagram .\nOther software improvements include new selfie filters and new shooting modes such as “guide shot”, which superimposes a previous photo into the frame to act as a reference for a new shot. This could really help Android sites when trying to take two photos of an identical scene using different settings, if it allows for that.\nSee also: New LG G6 photos surface 2 days ago The LG G6 will be fully unveiled in six days at a press event ahead of MWC 2017 .
