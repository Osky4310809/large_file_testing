For now, the future is there [on hold] because for now the league is not finished. Me and the guys are always focused. That's the main point. I'm a footballer, I belong to the field. After that is difficult.” \nIt had appeared as though Toure had been set to watch his final season at the Etihad Stadium from afar after being outcast by Guardiola at the start of the season. \nThe City boss had demanded an apology from Toure’s controversial agent, Dimitri Seluk, for various inflammatory comments he had made to the media in recent months, but recalled Toure, who apologised himself, for the away game at Crystal Palace in November. \nMan City could sign midfielder in January window \nToure was the star of the show that day, scoring twice in a 2-1 win, and has been one of City’s best performers since working his way back into the side. \nBut he admits that the club are not living up to expectations at the moment, having lost three times in December to fall seven points behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand. \n\"At the moment, we are not [at our best],” he added. “We have to be able to deliver. City have always been a team who fights to the end to win a trophy and at the moment we are not happy with our position in the league. \n“But we have to fight. We are starting the second half of the season now and I think we will have to be almost perfect [to win the title]. We'll have to win all the games when we play the top four. The lads, the fans, the manager we are all understanding that. This year we will try to do our best to get there.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:57:29.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
