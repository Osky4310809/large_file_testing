Prince 1.7k Share Tweet Follow \nIn a new video purportedly released by the Islamic State, ISIS celebrates its Belgian militants who carried out the deadly attacks at Zaventem airport and Maelbeek metro station. It also features United States presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nOn March 22, four men including Najim Laachraoui , brothers Khalid and Brahim El Bakraoui , and one more man still at large, conducted attacks against civilians in the Belgian capital in the name of the Islamic State. \nThe attacks came after “Paris attack mastermind,” Salah Abdeslam , was captured in the Brussels, Belgium district of Molenbeek after his fingerprints were found at the scene of a separate police raid. \nSalah Abdeslam was on the run since the November attacks, French police say. His brother, Ibrahim Abdeslam, also took part in the attacks. Teams of terrorists killed at least 129 people at several locations across Paris, including the Bataclan theater , the national soccer stadium and outside of restaurants. Abdeslam is widely thought to have developed, coordinated, and carried out the attack with the help of the Islamic State. \nISIS has since officially claimed the Brussels attacks. \nIn the new video, which was purportedly by pro-ISIS group Al Battar, Tuesday’s attacks in Belgium are summarized from a jihadist standpoint before Donald Trump is introduced. In the clip taken from an interview Trump did with CBS following the attacks, Trump calls Brussels a “horror show.” He continues: \nBrussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago, and it was amazing actually and safe, and now it’s a horror show, it’s an absolute horror show. \nWatch the video about the Brussels attacks with English subtitles above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:46:05.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
