The footage was taken from a Navy helicopter and reveals a fairly large UFO that, according to the Navy Captain, appeared “flat” and “elongated” with “two thermal spotlights like discharges that did not coincide with the axel of motion.”   The technician described it as “white with a semi-oval shape on the horizontal axis.” The nine minute video was released by CEFAA – the Chilean government agency which investigates UFO. Keep in mind, this is not the first time that highly trained military professionals have captured something astonishing and unexplainable on radar while in flight. Approximately 10 years ago, the Mexican government released footage of 11 bright objects that were moving rapidly across the sky which were captured by their Air Force pilots. Strangely, these objects were reported to be invisible to the eye, although captured on radar as well as infrared cameras. See picture below. The UFO phenomenon is worldwide and sightings are common. In 1976, a Spanish Air Force general told the world that “the nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data. Maybe when this group of nations acquired more precise and definite information, it will be possible to release the news to world.” ( source ) That same year, a lawsuit saw the release of compelling documents from the US defence intelligence agency regarding an incident in Iran. Two F-4 interceptor pilots reported seeing the object visually, it was also tracked on their airborne radar. Both planes experienced critical instrumentation and electronics go offline at a distance of twenty-five miles from the object. Here is an excerpt from the report:   “As the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical miles it lost all instrumentation and communications. When the F-4 turned away from the object and apparently was no longer a threat to it, the aircraft regained all instrumentation and communications. Another brightly lighted object came out of the original object. The second object headed straight toward the F4. ” (source) A couple of years later, Chile released a document detailing a dramatic event on the 16th of December. In this case, two pilots on a training mission, each flying an F5 fighter aircraft, tracked an object on radar that gave a return equal to ten or more aircraft carriers. Not only were the pilots picking it up on radar, it was also tracked on ground radar from a nearby airport that confirmed its huge size. The pilots also saw the object, stating that at a distance of 20 miles away it looked “like a plantain banana swathed in smoke.” The frightened pilots approached the object, which had been hovering motionless during the entire incident, and as they did it took off at a speed no known air craft is capable of. Mysteriously, it instantly disappeared from all three radar screens. ( Huneeus, J, Antonio, “A Chilean Overview,” MUFON UFO Journal, 6/86; Huneeus, J.

Below you’ll see the recently released video: The video shows two connected white circular lights or hot spots, giving off much heat (left). This image was part of an analysis by astrophysicist Luis Barrera. “Envoltura” means “envelope: Your Inbox Will Never Be The Same Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. The following is a picture of the mass size ‘hot’ plume that was discharged from the object. An article written in the Huffington Post by Leslie Kean, author of New York Times best seller UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials, says: “In two instances it discharged some type of gas or liquid with a high thermal track or signal” the technician stated. “After filming for about eight minutes, the stunning ejection of a massive plume of a very hot material is captured on the video, trailing behind the object. (The plume blended into the clouds when seen in HD.) Another ejection occurred moments later. It is indeed bizarre to watch this on the video.” Is This Physical Evidence of A UFO? During the two years in which Chile was investigating these videos, a number of meetings were held with the government investigators and scientists alike, including the active Air Force General who directs the DGAC and was completely baffled. No agreement was made as to what the object could be. It’s important to remember scientists have been calling for investigations into this phenomenon for decades. For example, Peter Andrew Sturrock , a British Scientist, and an Emeritus Professor of Applied Physics at Stanford University, and a number of other notable scientists around the world came together during the 1990’s in order to examine the physical evidence that is commonly associated with the UFO phenomenon. One example used by Sturrock in his analysis, was a photo taken by two Royal Canadian Air Force pilots on August 27th, 1956, in McCleod, Alberta, Canada. ( “Physical Evidence Related To UFO Reports” – The Sturrock Panel Report – Electromagnetic Effects ) ( source ) ( source ) Below is a great quote from Sturrock: “If it does indeed turn out that there is relevant physical evidence, if this evidence is carefully collected and analyzed, and if this analysis leads to the identification of several facts concerning the UFO phenomenon, then will be the time for scientists to step back and ask, what are these facts trying to tell us? If those facts are strong enough to lead to a firm conclusion, then will be the time to confront the more bizarre questions. If, for instance, it turns out that all physical evidence is consistent with a mundane interpretation of the causes of UFO reports, there will be little reason to continue to speculate about the role of extraterrestrial beings. If, on the other hand, the analysis of physical evidence turns up very strong evidence that objects related with UFO reports were manufactured outside the solar system, then one must obviously consider very seriously that the phenomenon involves not only extraterrestrial vehicles but probably also extraterrestrial beings.” ( source ) A more recent example would be Dr. Jacques Valle . Valle codeveloped the very first computerized mapping of Mars for NASA. He is also noted for his work at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), where he helped create ARPANET, a technology that became the foundation for the modern day internet. In the video below, he speaks about the the UFO phenomenon at the Global Competitiveness Forum in 2011. Here is a video of him giving a TEDx talk in Brussels. Extraterrestrial or Human? UFO does not mean extraterrestrial, but, one must take into account that as much evidence that there is which confirms the UFO phenomenon, there is also ample evidence suggesting that some of these objects are indeed inhabited by extraterrestrial beings, and this has been the thesis of multiple people who are “in the know.” For example, Herman Oberth, one of the founding fathers of rocketry and astronautics said, “flying saucers are real ” and “that they are space ships from another solar system.” Going on to say that he thinks that “they are possibly manned by intelligent observers who are members of a race that may have been investigating Earth for centuries.” ( source ) You can see some more interesting quotes on the subject in this article, just scroll to the bottom for quotes and sources.
