ALL COLORS NO GENRES is their main mission – from hip-hop to indie, electronica, R&B and pop, COLORS BERLIN allows artists to present themselves and their work in a contemporary way. We’ve teamed up with them on a series of video shorts in which artists are invited to perform one of their own tracks in the COLORS studio. \nThough he may not yet be on the level of a Rocky or a Ferg, at the end of the day A$AP Ant is still an anointed member of the A$AP Mob. Which means that he means business of the next-level rap game kind.\nAnt was of course busy last year with the release of the Mob’s excellent Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends, but he got up to plenty more than just a verse on tracks like “Yamborghini High” and “Crazy Brazy.” One of the peaks of his 2016 was a track titled “Finances,” a song that came with the instantly-memorable and oddball chorus “Deniro, fetti, provolone, guap.”\nIt was this track that he decided to bring to the studio at COLORS Berlin, and as you can see above, it was a performance that solidifies his reputation as an essential member of the Mob. And if his performance alone doesn’t do it for you, then the fact that he’s holding a lit blunt the whole time might do the trick. \nWatch the official music video for “Finances” below.\n\nBe sure to check out our previous installment of our COLORS Berlin series with grime rapper Devlin right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:34:18.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
