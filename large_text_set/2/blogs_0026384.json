Dutt posted a meme followed by a series of tweets with the hashtag #Bharatjaisijagahnai; something that Virender Sehwag had also used in his tweet. The concerned meme says that Hitler did not kill the jews, the gas did; Osama Bin Laden did not kill people, bombs did; ‘ Salman Khan ’ did not kill the black buck, the bullet did.” The tweet was directed at Kaur’s placard which said, “Pakistan did not kill my dad, the war killed him”. \nEarlier on Sunday, Virender Sehwag had shared his own version of the placard saying that it was his bat that had scored the two triple centuries but not him. These series of events come after violence at the Ramjas College allegedly by the hands of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, who had disrupted a conference at the college on ‘Culture of Protests’, which was to be attended by Jawahar Lal Nehru students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid. \n— Yogeshwar Dutt (@DuttYogi) February 28, 2017 \nJust a few days after the alleged stoning at Ramjas College and the violence that followed, Gurmehar Kaur, daughter of the late Captain Mandeep Singh, martyr of 1999 Kargil War, had changed her Facebook display picture to one with her holding the placard saying, “I AM A STUDENT OF DELHI UNIVERSITY. I AM NOT AFRAID OF ABVP. I AM NOT ALONE. EVERY STUDENT OF INDIA IS WITH ME. #FIGHTBACKDU #STUDENTSAGAINSTABVP”. In 2016, she had participated in a video saying that Pakistan had not killed her dad, but the war did.
