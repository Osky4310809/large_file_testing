My next opponent is Mark Hunt in New Zealand ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ June 10th #FoxSports1 pic.twitter.com/TUijbiz2TJ â€” Derrick Lewis (@Thebeast_ufc) March 20, 2017 \nLewis actually asked for a fight with Hunt after his win over Browne, which marked his sixth victory in a row with five of those ending by knockout or TKO. \nHunt will return following a disappointing outing in his last fight when he suffered a brutal knockout courtesy of Alistair Overeem at UFC 209 in early March. \nHunt has gone 2-3 with one no contest over his past six fights but he will look to get back on track when facing Lewis on home soil when they face off in June. It will be the time Australian Hunt has fought in his country of birth in an MMA career spanning 13 years. \nHe will require a medical clearance before signing a bout agreement as he is currently under medical suspension until April 19 following the brutalloss to Overeem. \nMeanwhile multiple MMA outlets have reported veteran Aussie fighter Kelly is likely to face Brunson at the Auckland event. Kelly has continued to defy the odds and upset UFC legend Rashad Evans at UFC 209 to improve his career record to 6-1 . Daniel Kelly (R) in action against Rashad Evans.
