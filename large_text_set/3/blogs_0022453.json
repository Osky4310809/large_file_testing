It’s so disgusting.” \nThat’s how Stacey Elkins describes the video that she says shows her daughter in various stages of undress with several young men. \nShe says her daughter appears to be scared, and the men are acting abusive toward the teen. \nElkins shared her concerns with Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson during a chance encounter outside the 10 th District police station as she was going in to file a missing person’s report. \nJohnson escorted her inside to make sure it was handled immediately. \n“I’m a father with two daughters, and I could see the pain in her face, and I want her to know that CPD is here to help you,” he tells Martinez. \nJohnson says he’s also very disturbed that at one point at least 36 people were watching the video live, but no one alerted police. \n“There were so many people that saw it and didn’t pick up the phone and dial 9-1-1. That’s just not right,” he says. \nElkins says she just wants her daughter to come home. \nAnyone with information is asked to call Chicago police. \nFacebook has taken the video down.
