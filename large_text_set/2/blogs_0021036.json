Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWe’re sitting next to Anastacia as she eats sushi for lunch and she’s given us her iPad to listen to her singing live on tour. It’s not the most comfortable of situations and we don’t really know how to behave. \nShould we tap our feet and click our fingers? Start singing along or bust some moves around the meeting room we’re in, fist-pumping the air to demonstrate how moved we are by her vocals? \nWe need the song to be over, not because we don’t like it, but because we can’t handle the awkwardness any longer. When it is, we of course tell her how much we love her powerhouse of a voice. We are just too British to cope with this kind of thing. \nBut Anastacia , as we know, is all American in her sensibilities. We can only dream of having her lack of self-deprecation and levels of self-assuredness. As we chat about various people she’s met and knows, she casually chucks in that her mate EJ (known otherwise to you and me as Elton John ) is ‘such a fan’, that Hugh Jackman was ‘in awe of me’ and that when she heard her live album for the first time, ‘I didn’t realise how good I was. It’s good. I’m like, “I did this?”’ \nHaving battled breast cancer twice, Anastacia has been through a lot in her 48 years, but she hasn’t let it beat her, and she’s feeling more confident in herself than ever before. \n\"I’m completely happy in my own skin, like I really love myself so much more than I did when I was younger. I look at old pictures and I remember I thought I was fat and I was a good 15lb less than I am now. I didn’t have a great capacity for self-worth then, but wisdom and confidence comes with age. Being older has made me better, and calmer,\" she says. \n\"I don’t get looked at as much as I used to because I was putting it out there with the cropped tops, cleavage everywhere and the peacock walk. I still do that on stage but I don’t do that when I’m regularly walking around on the earth. I’m now mum age. I get called Maam instead of Miss. But it doesn’t bother me.\" Anastacia and ex husband Wayne Newton (Photo: Wireimage) \nShe is, she says, happily single, having divorced her bodyguard ex-husband back in 2010. \n\"I never look and I never have looked. When I’m not looking there’s always an offer. I’m very comfortable with me, I’ve always been that way,\" she says. \"I love myself and I don’t compromise. I have the best of both worlds. I choose to be with people when I choose to be but I don’t need a man or children to validate me as a person.\" \nThere is one thing that left Anastacia feeling uncomfortable in her skin, and that was taking part in the last series of Strictly Come Dancing , which she was voted out of in week five. \n\"I was out of my element dancing and I didn’t love feeling that way. I’ve never felt like I dance as good as I sing and I kept comparing the two in my head. Everybody comes with their own baggage and that’s my baggage,\" she says. \n\"When I look back at it I’m horrified, because I know I didn’t dance well. I’m my own worst critic, which makes me focused on doing better. I knew I was limited in my movements. But I did it for women, and for breast cancer awareness. It was so emotional for me. I felt like I’d be letting women with breast cancer down by leaving.\" Anastacia and Brendan Cole when she was voted off Strictly Come Dancing (Photo: BBC) Read More Brendan Cole wants to replace Len Goodman as Strictly judge \nAnastacia is most definitely a trooper. \n\"I’m not nervous going out there, I don’t think of how many millions of people are watching. I don’t like nerves, they make me uncomfortable, so I talk them away because I don’t want them to be part of me.\" \nWhat on earth does it take to make this woman nervous then, we wonder? \n\"Maybe a date. That’s a whole different kind of nerves. If a guy starts flirting with me, I’m like, “Oh God!” I don’t know what to do.\" \nWe ask what her secrets are to looking great at 48, which she does, particularly when you think of all the cancer battles she has been through. She says she’s always looked young for her years. \n\"When I came out people thought I was 23 and I was 32, I looked really young. But health problems can age a person,’ she says. ‘I don’t drink and I don’t smoke. I’d rather have two Diet Cokes a week. Anything you put in your body that isn’t natural is a poison, so I pick and choose my poison. I don’t need alcohol to have a good time in a pub. I’m pretty much the first one on the bar. I love life, I love to live it and I don’t need an altered substance to do that.\" \nAnastacia is off on a UK tour in the coming months and, needless to say, it will not be the stuff of rock ‘n’ roll legend. On stage (Photo: Getty) \n\"I don’t go out at night and I don’t go to clubs and I’m not around smoke. It never gets rock ‘n’ roll, it’s like the “Milk and Cookies Tour”. My shots are ginger shots. I never let rip, because my health and my voice can’t handle that.\" \nSo, definitely no crates of Jack Daniels on the tour bus or parties in hotel rooms? \n\"It used to be Doritos and red wine and now it’s water, hummus, fruit and yoghurt. A hot humidifier is great! When I’m in a hotel it actually breaks my heart when people want to give me flowers when I’m only there for 24 hours because I can’t enjoy the gift. But I’ll give them to the tour bus driver for his wife, or the hotel maid.\" \nDoes she ever succumb to a diva moment, though? \n\"I’m proud to be a diva. I’m a diva because I like to have my hair and make-up done, and I like to wear pretty clothes. I haven’t had diva moments, though, but I’ve had moments when maybe I’m not of sound mind and I’m like, “My coffee is not hot enough!” Like it can be a time-of-the-month situation where you’re crying because you burnt your toast. I’ve done things that haven’t been rational.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T09:36:01.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
