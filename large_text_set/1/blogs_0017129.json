Quite funny, isn't it, how things work out, he was my favourite cricketer until that point. \n\"I think he was worse for wear, That was his excuse when he replied [on Twitter]. It was so embarrassing, as well. He didn't even just say, 'No'. He handed me off, as well.\" Evans' career in stats Australian Open: Fourth round (2017) Wimbledon: Third round (2016) French Open: First qualifying round (2014) US Open: Third round (2013, 2016) 'He would have been proud of my efforts' Dan Evans pointed to the sky after his victory over Bernard Tomic \nImmediately after winning the final point of the match against Tomic, Evans was overcome with emotion and was seen pointing up to the sky. \nHe later revealed it was a tribute to his former coach Julien Hoferlin, who died of cancer last year. \nIn 2014 Hoferlin criticised Evans, saying tennis was just a \"brief interlude in his life\". \nSpeaking after his victory on Friday, Evans told the BBC: \"When he [Horferlin] coached me I didn't give 100% at the time and there was off-court stuff he wasn't happy with. \n\"I wish he could have seen what happened tonight, he would have been proud of my efforts. He always said I could do it and that I should be playing top-40 tennis. Tonight was for him.\" Evans deals with nuisance spectator \nEvans managed to overcome being distracted by an unruly spectator at the Hisense Arena. \n\"This guy was coughing as I was throwing the ball up, as well as screaming at me when I was losing points,\" he said. \nEvans was also asked about comments from Tomic's father and coach, John, who once told him he was not good enough to train with his son. \nThe British number three said Tomic snr congratulated him in the changing room after the match. \n\"It was nice of him,\" added Evans. \"I didn't have a problem with him at all, to be honest. It was his opinion.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:54:48.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
