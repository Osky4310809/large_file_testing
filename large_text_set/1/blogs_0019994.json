Aubameyang has stated his desire to take on a new challenge, but only at a handful of clubs deemed big enough. The first team that comes to mind? Real Madrid , of course. \nDortmund appear to have made contingency plans should Aubameyang leave, too. The club recently snapped up up-and-coming striker Alexander Isak. Dortmund aren’t under intense pressure to accept just any old bid for their Gabonese striker, however. He’s under contract until June 2020, so there’s no threat of Dortmund losing him for nothing — a la Robert Lewandowski. \nAveraging more than a goal per Bundesliga match this season, Aubameyang has been as advertised after a breakout 2014/15 season. It would take a hefty sum to prize Auba away from BVB, and Watzke acknowledges as much. Whether or not a big club ponies up enough cash to open the discussion remains to be seen. But if they do, Dortmund look ready to listen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:54:40.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
