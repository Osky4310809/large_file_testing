Then came Jimmy Kimmel ‘s opening monologue, which, as expected, was very political. \n“This broadcast is being watched live by millions of Americans and around the world in more than 225 countries that now hate us,” he began. Kimmel then talked about our divided country, and said he can’t help people unite. He then poked fun at Mel Gibson , saying that there’s “Only one Braveheart in the audience, and he can’t unite us either.” But, he said, that we can “Make America Great Again” by trying to have constructive conversations with those we disagree with. \nOf course, it wouldn’t be a Kimmel bit without at least mentioning his ongoing “feud” with Matt Damon , calling him “a selfish person.” \nHe also mentioned President Donald Trump by name, thanking him, and asking, “Remember last year when people thought the Oscars were racist?” \nKimmel then discussed the nominees and gave a special shoutout to Meryl Streep and referenced her Golden Globes speech calling out Trump as well as Trump’s Tweet from the next day, where he called her “overrated.” Kimmel said Streep has “Phoned it in for more than 50 films over the course of her lackluster career.” Tonight, she’s been nominated for her 20th Oscar. He then had the audience give her a “totally undeserved” round of applause. \nWatch the video above. \n[featured image via screen grab] \nHave a tip we should know?
