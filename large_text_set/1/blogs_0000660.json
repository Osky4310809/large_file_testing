He said the new 538 square-metre location is a “perversion” and “aberrant.” \n“I repeat, selling mega-sandwiches in Borgo Pio is a disgrace,” Sgreccia told London’s Mirror , suggesting the money could be better spent on helping the area’s homeless population. \n“The area’s needy ... and suffering, as the Holy Father teaches.” \nThe Vatican is set to collect a monthly rent of 30,000 euros (or A$43,200) from McDonald’s, according to La Repubblica. The Vatican’s real estate is controlled by the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See. \nThere are already two existing McDonald’s outposts close to the Vatican, in addition to a Burger King, but the new McDonald’s is the only restaurant located in a building owned by the state. \nThis isn’t the first time McDonald’s has had to fight for space in Italy. media_camera Locals rejected a proposal to build a Macca’s in front of Florence’s Duomo. \nIn July, thousands of Italians signed a Facebook petition objecting to a proposal to build a McDonald’s in the historic Piazza del Duomo. The International Slow Food Movement, a grassroots organisation opposed to fast food, also protested the opening of a McDonald’s near the Spanish Steps. \nThe fast food chain later sued the city of Florence after its application to build the site in the Piazza del Duomo was rejected. \nThis article originally appeared on Fox News and was reproduced with permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:34:24.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
