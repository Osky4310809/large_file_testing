Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → The Cast of Jane the Virgin Reacts to the Show's Heartbreaking Surprise Death \nMAJOR SPOILERS from Monday night's episode of Jane the Virgin below! \nAfter a few seasons full of not-so-subtle hints from Jane the Virgin 's narrator that Michael Cordero (Brett Dier) wouldn't make it out of the show alive, he was killed off in season three's 10th episode, \"Chapter Fifty-Four.\" Despite all of the foreshadowing, it still came as quite a shock for tons of fans, but they weren't the only ones grieving. The cast shared a number of heartbreaking Instagram photos commemorating Dier's time on the show, both as an actor and as their real-life friend. Gina Rodriguez , who plays the show's titular Jane (and Michael's wife), posted a picture of her and Dier hugging with the caption, \"You are my partner in artistic crime. We did two plus seasons together and I will never have the words to express how you changed my life. Thank you @brettdier #teamMichaelForever #janethevirgin #DreamComeTrueActingPartner.\" Rodriguez also shared a video Dier left on her phone in character as Michael, and it's safe to say that any loyal fan of the show will get a little teary-eyed after watching it. \nAlthough Michael and Rafael were in constant competition on Jane the Virgin , Dier and Rafael's real-life counterpart — Justin Baldoni — are good friends IRL. Baldoni also took to Instagram to say how much he'll miss him. \"It's so rare to meet someone who can instantly make a gloomy day feel so endlessly bright. There wasn't a day I didn't look forward to coming to set and laughing with you brother,\" he captioned his black-and-white group photo. \"You were my first bromance and no one will ever replace you.\" Other costars like Yael Grobglas, Andrea Navedo, Jaime Camil, and Dier himself also reached out, so check them all out below (just make sure you have a box of tissues handy).
