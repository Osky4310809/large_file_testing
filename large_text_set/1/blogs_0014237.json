But now it’s 2017 and she’s hosting Saturday Night Live , not uploading secret files to spaceships or running around with Tom Hanks. This is serious business on a live stage, so she’s going to need some help. \nLuckily Kenan Thompson was around to summon one of SNL’s past greats via hologram, giving Jones the grace and experience of Tina Fey in her corner. Fey pulls off an impressive Princess Leia — something we already know from 30 Rock — so it’s no surprise that she’s able to pull off the role so well here. After reminding Jones that Steve Seagal was able to host the show successfully, she warns her about dealing with Leslie Jones legendary horniness and anger. \n\nIt isn’t a laugh riot, but it is better than forcing Jones to sing or filling the stage full of random Star Wars characters. Kenan as Saw Gerrera was just enough, especially when he returns later to defend why he still has a job with the show. We like to think the show needs Kenan more than he needs it , but that’s hard to say when you have a family to feed. \n(Via SNL )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T07:17:39.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
