That morning the HSE phoned Ms Halvey to finally provide Megan a pre-operative date on March 2 and an operation date on March 9. \nThe mother believes had they not appeared on TV, they could well still be waiting today. \n\"I know Megan wasn't scheduled for any surgery, as I was ringing Crumlin Children's Hospital everyday continuously, so I don't know where the order came from but I know the hospital had to have been told by someone high up that 'she's not to go on the Late Late without a date after the documentary.' \n\"It frustrates me so much as a mother because no mother ever wants to put their child on TV, to expose their private life like that, particularly as Megan is a teenager, she needs privacy. \n\"I now hope that this Government, the Minister for Health, Simon Harris, the Department of Health and the HSE, stick to improving the system, that the Minister stays true to his statements that things will improve.\" Irish Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:56:54.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
