Superior Court.\nOfficers observed Marci Wahl, 38, hanging inside the fence by her shoelaces, according to charging documents. After she was arrested, Wahl told officers she was at the White House to speak to President Trump.\nOfficers held Wahl against the fence to keep her from falling on her head while they freed her, according to the documents.\nEarlier that night, about 10:45 p.m., officers noticed Wahl walking on the west side of the White House, stopping multiple times and looking up at the building. An officer later noticed Wahl walking on the north side of the White House and then pausing before she reached the west side of the south fence, documents say. There was no information in the documents detailing whether officers observed Wahl climbing the barrier before she was found dangling from the top.\nWahl was carrying a map of the White House when she was arrested.\nShe was charged with one count of unlawful entry of the White House grounds “against the will of Donald Trump, the lawful occupant thereof and the person lawfully in charge thereof,” according to charging documents.\nWahl’s next hearing is scheduled for April 27.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@keithlalexander"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T04:51:50.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
