Hameed Ali (retd.), had said the container came from China, but was routed through Turkey to “cause confusion.” \nHe had explained that three suspects, Oscar Okafor (importer), Mahmud Hassan (clearing agent) and Sadique Mustapha (escort) had been arrested. \nTwo days later, two customs officers — Abdullahi I, and Odiba Inah — who cleared the container were arrested and transferred to the Customs headquarters in Abuja. \nWhen asked when the suspects would be charged to court since it was up to two weeks that they had been detained, Attah said the outcome of the investigations would determine the next line of action for the service. \nHe said, “They are facing investigations already. It is only when investigations are completed that appropriate actions can be taken. \n“All those concerned with the importation of the rifles are currently under investigations. And when the investigations are completed, the findings of the investigations will determine further action.” \n  \nContact:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:49:12.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
