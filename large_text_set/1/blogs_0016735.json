But, we are starting to see not qualifying as normal. \n“I think there should be a lot more discussion about failure and what we can do and solutions.” \nHe added: “I feel there are still a lot of parents and fans out there that raise their voice when we fail, there is a lot of disappointment. I sense that, but guys in the media, states, federation, there needs to be a lot more discussion, because everyone wants to see our boys do well, as well as Australians in top leagues in Europe. \n“We’ve had that, and now we’re going backwards. That’s why discussion and criticism is important.” \nSo, what are the issues? \nZelic pinpoints a couple of key talking points to get the debate moving. \n- Kids being active in their spare time \n- The balance between enjoying the game but creating an environment where wining means something - to handle pressure at a higher level. \n- Individual technical tweaks/coaching for players at an age they are like sponges \n- Use the knowledge of our past players “who have gone on to do great things” to brainstorm solutions, and visit schools, junior clubs, to pass on knowledge.

It complemented a shorter junior football season, which Australia still has compared to other countries, but also brought in other physical components like sprinting and mobility from fielding that helped his game. \n“I don’t see that sort of thing today. Before, kids were everywhere. On the streets, playing, down at the oval, you constantly saw active kids. \n“I think one of the big parts of what’s needed is parents’ influence as well. Kids need to be pushed a little bit more. It’s not like our parents pushed us – it was normal. It’s different times now, with computer games. Don’t get me wrong – we still played computer games. But we were more active, outside and constantly on the go.” TSV 1860 Munich's Ned Zelic (L) against former club Dortmund in 1998. Source: AP \nHAVE FUN, BUT DEMAND THE BEST FROM THEM TOO \nSimply, Aussie kids aren’t playing enough, and when they are, it’s not at the intensity to prepare them for anything near the top. \nZelic left Australia and went straight into the furnace of German giant Borussia Dortmund in 1992 and he thinks he was able to do that because of a preparation he received. \n“I just think the balance was a lot better,” he assessed. “I still think we’re producing talent. There are still kids here we can get excited about, a few running around the A-League, a few overseas doing well … but that’s reduced drastically to before. \n“I think a big difference – and I can only talk about my generation and our environment - it was a better balance between technical ability and parallel mental strength, because you were in a tough environment, one where winning is a lot more important. You had different pressures to deal with. That’s what I feel the big difference is today.” \nHe concludes: “It’s about creating an environment where there is a bit of pressure to win. \n“It’s not a case of: well, we’re here to develop and that’s more important than results. \n“That message takes a few percent away from a player out there.” \n“So it’s not: we’ve let them have their fun, and now they’re 15, now we’re going to tell them to win. It doesn’t work like that, you can’t just flick it on like a light switch. That type of development, with balance, is important.” \nPODCAST: Another big week of football is wrapped up by Adam Peacock, Simon Hill and Daniel Garb. \nCOMPARISONS TO GERMANY \nWhen he walked into Dortmund as a 20-year-old, as one of three foreigners in the squad, Zelic felt equipped to deal with the pressure. \n“It’s a tough business, you’ve got to prepare our boys for an absolutely brutal business. \n“Looking back on where I played, junior clubs, the Institute (of Sport) for a year, I never felt there was a period, even Young Socceroos or Olympics, where winning wasn’t important. \n“I can only speak for myself, but the whole development system I went through there was a constant pressure to win situation. \n“The thing is I didn’t feel the pressure, because it was something normal.” \nOn his arrival in Germany, he said: “Hour and a half sessions, full on war, massive competition for places. I was pretty much thrown into it immediately and adapted to it. I quickly learnt the German winning mentality. I was just an Aussie kid coming over.” \nZelic looks at the likes of Mustafa Amini, Daniel De Silva and Terry Antonis as examples of players going abroad today who “haven’t cracked it”. \n“It’s important to talk about these things because it’s a good guide for how to do things better and help them.” Mustafa Amini of Australia Source: Getty Images \nWhile Zelic says you can’t make straight comparisons between different countries, it is interesting to see how others operate and what works elsewhere. \nSpeaking on the World of Football Show last week , Zelic talked about the attitudes of his old Dortmund teammate Matthias Stammer, as a comparison, drawn from his stint in charge of Germany’s youth teams. \n“I remember speaking to him when he first got the job (and asked him) what’s your goal: he said, we want to bring back a winning mentality because we’re not happy at the moment. We want to improve our technical quality and we want to win EVERY game we play. \n“Obviously people say it’s all about the development, but speaking to him and standing next to him (during games and watching how intense he was) … automatically you’re putting them under pressure. \n“There needs to be a demand here to get the best out of our kids. It’s fun, but it’s also serious business as well.” Kewell, Lazaridis, Zelic, Vidmar.

I still feel there’s good junior talent out there, in the A-League too. There’s still enough there to be encouraged by.” \nZelic, who has a 10-year-old son, adds that it’s important to correct kids’ habits in their formative years. Inevitably, he says, they’ll end up enjoying the game more when they’re executing well. The Olyroos have found qualifying tough in Asia. Source: News Limited \n“We really have to target improving technical ability and improving kids’ games and we need to target the younger age groups. \n“You see how much more they enjoy the game when they’re doing things right. \n“My boy, who is quick, would try and run around players in a semi-circle sort of way. I used to tell him: instead of doing that, do it for 10 metres and then cut in and you’ll have a shorter distance and be able to have a crack at goal. After a few days, he was doing it. It stayed with him too. It showed me that kids they can learn quickly. They soak up information. If you don’t overcomplicate things, it can really improve their game and they enjoy it a lot more.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
