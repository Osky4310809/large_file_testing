But when the researchers analyzed the participants’ melatonin levels pre-camping trip, they discovered that melatonin stayed at high levels well into the morning, meaning their bodies weren’t ready to wake up yet. After the camping trip, however, participants’ melatonin levels went down as soon as they woke up, which indicates they had defeated the jet lag. \nParticipants fell asleep 2.5 hours earlier on average while they were in the woods, which makes sense considering the study cites a 13-fold decrease in exposure to light in the tent as compared to the participants’ daily environments. Wintertime magnifies these effects because the sun turns in earlier, and our bodies expect us to do the same. But the solution is simple: For Monday mornings that suck less, go to bed with the sun the week before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:13:28.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
