King Rodriguez/Presidential Photo   President Rodrigo Duterte prefers a reasonable compromise with those who have tax deficiencies over the filing of cases, saying he already needs money to build hospitals in violence-stricken areas in Mindanao. Duterte said it would take years before the courts decide on the cases filed against tax evaders. “The law allows a compromise and I will allow compromise rather than the other party filing a case… It will be decided 10 years from now. I need the money now,” the president said during a convention of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Friday in Pasay. “It is not illegal. It is not unlawful for me to suggest this rather than if they choose to fight it in court and the so very slow process. I’d rather that a compromise be made. No particular party. Anyone can enter into a compromise. I am suggesting it so I can use the money,” he added. Duterte’s statement came after the Bureau of Internal Revenue filed a P9.5 billion case against cigarette manufacturer Mighty Corp., for allegedly using fake tax stamps. The president said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez and Bureau of Internal Revenue Commissioner Caesar Dulay are not in favor of a settlement. “It must be a reasonable one for those with big tax cases. Sonny Dominguez, the finance officer and Dulay, (of) BIR, I have yet to convince them to compromise,” Duterte said. “I asked Sonny Dominguez. He did not agree with me. He needs P9 (billion). I need only P3 (billion) because I will build a hospital in Basilan, P1 billion (for a) hospital in Jolo and squatters area, another billion,” he added. It was not clear if Duterte was referring to the case of Mighty Corp., whose owner, Alex Wong Chu King, is an adopted member of the Philippine Military Academy class of 1967 just like the president. In the same event, Duterte reminded businessmen to pay the proper taxes and to help in the fight against corruption. “I have fired to date so many regulators of the LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board) and even BIR and Customs. I do not want to embarrass, you know, probably their sons and daughters are already doctors. Just leave quietly. I do not want to humiliate people,” the president said. He also reiterated his call for Filipinos to be more assertive and to report government personnel who tried to extort money from them. “Report him (corrupt official) to me and in front of you, I’ll slap him,” the president said.
