Lee Blackwell.\nHe was testifying at the trial for admitted al Qaeda member Ibrahim Harun, 46, who is charged with killing Losano, 24, of Texas, and Army Pvt. Jerod Dennis, 19, of Oklahoma, in the Afghanistan ambush as well as plotting bomb strikes against US facilities in Nigeria.\n“We could see insurgents coming toward us,” Blackwell, 53, told jurors in Brooklyn federal court. “The last thing I said to Ray was, ‘Stay behind your ruck[sack] and you’ll be fine.’ That’s when I saw him get shot in the head.”\nJerod Dennis and Raymond Losano Blackwell and Losano were following up on intel about insurgents near the Afghan-Pakistan border in 2003.\nAs they descended on the mountain range, they immediately “started getting shot at in every direction.”\n“There was nowhere to hide,” Blackwell said, noting there was an American Humvee with a machine gun on top. “I said, ‘We’re gonna run for cover, brother.’ We did, and I started patting him down” to make sure he wasn’t hit.\nBut as he tried to climb inside the vehicle, Losano was struck. Blackwell ran over and grabbed him.\n“I expected him to be dead,” Blackwell said, his voice shaking. “I expected to see something ugly. But he was alive. He was glassy-eyed, unconscious.\n“I picked him up, screaming for the medic. Ray was clawing at me,” he said. “I told him I loved him, I was proud of him, and I told him to hang in there.”\nThe bullet had “practically ripped off [Losano’s] jaw,” prosecutors said.\nLosano, a tactical air command and control specialist had a wife back home who was pregnant with their second daughter when he was gunned down.\nEarlier in the day, another soldier was nearly moved to tears as he gave dramatic testimony about surviving the assault.\nDavid Cyr (left), Jerrod Dennis and Eddie Camacho “I thought it was going to be the end,” said Sgt. First Class David Cyr, his jaw clenching as he looked at a photo of himself and Dennis standing on the same ridge where Dennis would die in a hail of bullets and grenades.\nCyr remembered watching the bullets “peel the bark off the tree” he was hiding behind when he decided he wasn’t going to die and “got angry.”\nHe started crawling towards fellow soldiers but the insurgents kept bombarding him.\n“Someone yelled grenade, and I dove,” Cyr said, glassy-eyed. “But I was close enough that when I dived, it spun me in the air. I landed and rolled over, and crawled back to the tree. Right then another grenade landed where I’d been laying.”\nDennis was later helicoptered out, and died after losing too much blood.\nHarun, who, in the past has been uncooperative with his lawyers and has been attending the trial via video, faces up to life in prison.\nDefense attorneys said they spoke with Harun Wednesday — as opposed to the day before, when he “was just screaming” at them.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:14:29.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
