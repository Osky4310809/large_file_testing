Particularly the one on Steven Adams in last year’s Western Conference Finals .\nMorris lost the ball as he was being guarded by Mason Plumlee , and kicked him square in the crotch.\nLet me tell you, getting kicked there isn’t great, and Morris had on blue foamposites. Those are a pretty solid sneaker that certainly didn’t help Plumlee’s region at all. Morris received a flagrant 2 for the kick, and was ejected from the game.\nIf Morris wanted to show off his shoe game, he has succeeded in his endeavor.\nHopefully Plumlee isn’t hurting too bad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T06:29:20.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
