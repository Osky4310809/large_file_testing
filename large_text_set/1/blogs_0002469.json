Kristina Rodulfo From ELLE Whether it's your New Year's Resolutions to \"get fit\" or not–a peach emoji-level butt is among the most desirable outcomes of regular exercise. And, while most trainers will argue that spot training is not effective (you can't get a six pack by doing 300 crunches and nothing else, after all), who's to say a little extra help in one area will get you nowhere? Enter business executive-turned-entrepreneur Erika Rayman and her recently launched, glutes-focused exercise machine, The DB Method . The foldable, tiny apartment-friendly resistance contraption ($189) is built to modify your squat so you can target your backside more directly, safely, and yield results in a shorter amount of time. Photo credit: The DB Method More \"It's actually a biomechanially correct machine–you are not ever going to over-extend your knees over your toes,\" Rayman explains, calling out the most common squat mistake. She says that oftentimes when you do an unassisted squat, your quads are doing most of the work. The DB Method aligns your body so they're alleviated and your butt's muscles are more isolated instead. You get proper form every time, so injury-prone knees catch a break too. \"You want your knees to be in line with your ankles and the machine sets you up to have a form so that you can have a better functioning squat,\" ModelFIT trainer Lilli VanHall , who demonstrates The DB Method below, adds, \"[While doing a squat], people are usually crunching their hip flexors rather than engaging their butt, so the ability to sit back is actually what makes a difference.\" See how The DB Method works, ahead, with Rayman's five-minute workout plus add-ons that show the machine can work beyond your glutes.
