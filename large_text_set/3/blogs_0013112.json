In the posting, “B” gave his perspective of the events that occurred and how he came to understand the situation. \nHe also shared his thoughts on Iron’s interview (held on March 14), and explained why “A” did not come forward to the press right after the assault happened. “B” then stressed that this case was reported because she was threatened and assaulted when she tried to end her relationship, and also warned that they will take legal action against the harmful comments and false claims made about “A.” \nFinally, he revealed a conversation that “A” had with Iron’s older sister, who allegedly attempted to reach an agreement with her five months after the assault occurred. The full Facebook post “B” wrote reads as follows: \n“Hello, I am the boyfriend of ‘A,’ Iron’s assault victim. \n“Since the beginning of my relationship with ‘A,’ a lot has changed for me. I originally thought that being alone was comfortable. But after being with her, I felt like I wanted to take care of this person for the first time in my life. \n“Even now, when I see ‘A’ going through such a difficult time, I can’t stand it so much that I’m losing my mind. And while I’m not good with words, I have the courage to speak up instead of just thinking ‘The truth will come out’ or ‘It seems like the lies will become the truth.’ \n“When I was with ‘A,’ we both got bored of our relationship, and so we fought a lot, grew tired of how things were, and stopped contacting one another. (I knew the truth about ‘A’ seeing Iron during this time because she told me herself.) \n“‘A’ contacted me at 7 a.m. on October 5 of last year, saying ‘I’m going through a hard time. Can I come over? I’m such a mess right now. I’m sorry for always making things difficult.’ I refused because I had wanted to end things with her. However, I had an uncomfortable feeling that I couldn’t shake off, and I began to worry about what might have happened to her. \n“Then I got a call from an unknown number. When I answered the phone, it turned out to be from Iron. I was in the middle of something at the time, so I thought it was her father calling to tell me that something had happened to her. But when I went to meet him, it turned out to be Iron. He was in an agitated state, and was hitting his own face while saying, ‘If you have something you want to say to me, then say it.’ \n“I tried to calm him down and told him that we should talk. So we had a conversation over some beer. When Iron and I began to talk, I wanted to settle our misunderstandings. (At the time, I had no idea that ‘A’ had been physically assaulted by him.) \n“He told me that he called things off with ‘A’ early in the morning after the two had a fight, and said that we could help each other out if we had a problem with ‘A.’ When he spoke like that, I started to doubt him. Soon enough, I found out the truth about how he assaulted her, and I hated myself for rejecting her call. \n“When I found ‘A,’ her face and body were literally a mess. She had a split lip, and parts of her face and her body were bruised. One of her fingers was fractured too. (At the time, she had not gone to the hospital, so we did not know it was a fracture.) When I saw that ‘A’ was too scared to report him because of the possible retaliation, it hurt my heart so much. \n“While she was afraid of retaliation at first, ‘A’ reported him. Over the next five weeks, she was diagnosed and received surgery. After leaving the hospital, she was afraid of being in her own house and so she stayed with me instead. She received psychological counseling. Even now, the surgeries for her fractured finger are still not finished. Her parents worried a lot and lost sleep over their concern that the public would believe Iron’s word over hers. It makes me so angry to see the victims going through such difficulty while the abuser is fine. \n“Today, articles stating that the case ‘happened six months ago’ were released without prior notice. ‘A’ could have taken the incident to the media as soon as it happened, but she was scared that her personal information would be released. And like the previous celebrity sexual assault cases, she was afraid of being labeled as a snake who tries to get settlement money. However, because of Iron’s fake interview, the victim’s personal information has been disclosed. And because of this, ‘A,’ who has already had to deal with assault, now has to face cyberbullying. \n“The point of the case is that she was threatened and assaulted when trying to end the relationship. It is not about sex or her sexual preferences. Also, the gossip involving her old modeling pictures is causing a second round of pain for the victim. \n“‘A’ is not thinking about whether or not she will get settlement money. She isn’t even thinking about reaching an agreement with him. Additionally, we are currently taking screenshots of harmful comments, false information, and defamation of character made against ‘A’ online, and we have appointed a lawyer to take on the case. If you see any related posts or comments, I would be really grateful if you could send it to me in an e-mail. My address is [email protected] \n“Lastly, I have attached a conversation between ‘A’ and Iron’s older sister. Five months ago, she attempted to reach out to ‘A’ to come to an agreement.” See the conversation between “A” and Iron’s sister below: \nAt the start of the conversation, Iron’s sister introduces herself, saying that she is contacting ‘A’ on his behalf and would like to “meet to apologize and have a conversation.”‘A’ responds by telling her about the counseling she received and the status of her fractured finger, adding that “seeing [Iron’s sister] in person would probably be difficult.” \nIron’s sister writes back that she “completely understands how [she] feels,” but also shares that Iron’s lawyer fees would cost 10 million won (approximately $8,700) and that their mother is currently very sick. \n“So I wanted to meet in person and plead with you,” she wrote. “I hope you give Heon Chul (Iron’s real name) the opportunity to apologize to both you and your parents. If you don’t want to meet, I would like to meet with your parents. I’m really sorry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:08:59.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
