To pass the test, you must answer 75 per cent, or 15 out of 20 questions, correctly. \nThis quiz below is a sample of practice questions migrants can do which are listed on the Border Force website. \nSee how you go. Can you pass the test? Take Our Quiz! \nMr Dutton said we need to look at whether we have the right test in place for future migrants coming to Australia. \n“The question we face is whether or not we have the right test, the right questions ... whether or not people know Don Bradman’s batting average is a true test of whether or not somebody shares an Australian value,” he told 2GB radio. \nThe controversial test was brought in by the Howard government in 2007 and covered Australia’s history, sporting greats, government, geography and traditions. \nThe Rudd government tweaked the test two years later to cover civic duty and responsibilities. \nTopics include the significance of Anzac Day, the role of the governor-general, laws and government, and the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T01:16:20.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
