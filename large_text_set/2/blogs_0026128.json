He had nine dunks.\nAfter a hard-fought first half, which ended with the Eagles (21-8) leading 31-25, Simons exploded in the third quarter. He threw down four gravity-defying slams during a 13-2 run that turned a competitive game into a laugher.\n“It’s hard sometimes for Anfernee because of how he’s guarded, but I think he’s the best player in the state,” said Edgewater coach Jason Atherton. “It’s not just the scoring, but he passes well, defends the best players, he does it all.”\nEdgewater will leave the comfort of its home gym this Friday, traveling to face Tampa Hillsborough with a trip to state on the line.\nEdgewater turned up the defensive pressure and gave the Wolves fits as the game went on, creating 24 turnovers.\n“If we can defend and rebound, we can run,” said Atherton. “We know we can be tough to stop in transition.”\nMichael Eads added 21 points and Frank Foreman scored 13 for the Eagles.\nDeltona star Blake Hinson scored 19 to lead the Wolves, but was held to 5-20 shooting.\n Varsity", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ad066f/turbine/os-anfernee-simons-scores-30-as-edgewater-defeats-deltona-20170221"], "published": "2017-02-22T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:28:03.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
