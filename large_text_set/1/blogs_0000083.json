There’s nothing wrong with being the cool Indie lad at work who aces at the style game. \nWe suggest you keep a few pointers in mind before going all out to conquer the sartorial race. \n1. Subtlety is the key to success dressing at work. So while you choose to flaunt the Indie vibe, make sure that your kurta doesn’t blind your colleagues with those blingy beads. \n2. While bright is fine when you’re dressing up in all your wedding refinery, we suggest you stick to sober hues when you’re headed to work. Think pastels, earthy hues, and solid colours (read: black and white). \n3. Make sure that the material of your outfit is preferably in cotton or linen. You don't want to be the shiny Christmas tree at that all-important client meet. And rest assured, that shine ain't helping you shine at work! \n4. Be particular about the fit. Especially if you decide to opt for a kurta-shirt, instead of the clichéd classic shirt. You do not want a very laidback vibe at work, which might actually work adversely to your corporate well-being. So when you do opt for an Indian silhouette, make sure it fits you precisely and looks crisp. \n5. If you're going all formal and proper with a bandhgala, keep your accessories subtle. You might want to let go of that pocket square, and keep your shirt a contrasting understated hue. \n6. Mix and match. Please DO NOT experiment with a sherwani at work, unless you’re dressing up for a costume party. Pair a short kurta with skinny trousers, or even denims (if your office isn’t fussy about a formal dress code). \nAskMen picks: Denim Bandhgala \nDenim is so on-trend, and so is this bandhgala, which you can easily wear to work for a semi-formal look. Team it with a well-fitted trouser to look sharp. \nDenim Bandhgala, Rs. 6,800 Nehru Jacket \nThis ombre blue Nehru is perfect for that cool Indie vibe. Pair it with a crisp shirt and trouser to complete the look with signature style. \nSilk Heavy Nehru Jacket, Rs. 2,990 Silk Bundi \nThis gingham bundi could well be one of your statement pieces in office wear. However, just make sure that the fit is perfect when you’re teaming it with a shirt and tailored trouser. \nSilk Natural Nehru Jacket, Rs. 3,290 Bandhgala Blazer \nThis single-breasted blazer designed in bandhgala style is perfect for that office to evening wear smooth transition, especially if it’s a sit-down do you’re heading to post work. Slim fitted and crisp, be sure to be in shape if you want to slay this ensemble. \nMr Button Slim Fit Bandhgala Blazer, Rs. 7,999 Nehru Charcoal Jacket \nThis Nehru jacket made from comfortable cotton duck with gun metal buttons in a sober charcoal colour is what you need for that old-school vibe. The polka dotted lining inside is quite cool, and the comfortable welt pockets add an additional dash of style along with utility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:46:21.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
