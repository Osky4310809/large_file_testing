We are talking about one-fifth of our our economy.” \n“We can either do it quickly as the Democrats did, and end up with a monstrosity, where premiums go up an access is limited, or we can do it right,” Spicer explained. \nSpicer stressed the importance of drafting quality legislation that achieves the goals it seeks to accomplish, while also reassuring supporters the president is committed to repealing Obamacare as soon as possible.
