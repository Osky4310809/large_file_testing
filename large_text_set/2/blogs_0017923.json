Williams reunion February 22, 2017 5:20pm by Staff writers Source: FOX SPORTS ONE of the league’s greatest franchises has amped up its chase for Andrew Bogut, while the Timberwolves are on the hunt for a former MVP. \nThe Trade Deadline is less than 48 hours away, and the chatter is at an all-time high. \nHere’s what you need to know. \nCELTICS CONTINUE TO CHASE ANDREW BOGUT \nThe Bogut-to-Celtics rumours have been around for months and, with the Trade Deadline just around the corner, they’ve picked up some more steam. \nAccording to DallasBasketball.com’s Mike Fisher, the Celtics and Mavericks are discussing a deal that would send the big-man to Boston. NBA source tells me #Celtics & #Mavs expect to talk Bogut trade - dependent on what bigger move Boston can make. — mike fisher ✭ (@fishsports) February 21, 2017 \nThe Mavericks are clearly looking to rebuild, with owner Mark Cuban telling ESPN that the team is willing to take contracts if they’re able to package them with draft picks. Mark Cuban tells ESPN that Dallas is willing to take on contracts in advance of Thursday's trade deadline if draft compensation is attached. — Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) February 21, 2017 \nAnalysis : The Celtics need a presence on the glass — they’re 29th in the league in defensive rebounding — so Bogut would be a good fit for them. They’ll likely aim for a higher profile player like Jimmy Butler first, but Bogut would be a good fit as they chase the No. 1 seed in the East. \nTHIBODEAU WANTS A D-ROSE REUNION \nTom Thibodeau has been trying to bring help to Minnesota all year, and it appears he’s looking at his former point guard, Derrick Rose. \nThe former Bulls head coach is on the lookout for an upgrade for Ricky Rubio, which he believes is Rose, the 2011 MVP. \nThe Timberwolves have reached out to the Knicks to discuss a trade, according to ESPN’s Ian Begley. \nPODCAST!

New York Knicks guard Derrick Rose. Source: AP \nWord is that the Timberwolves have made Rubio available, with him and Rose likely to be the headliners of the potential deal. \nAnalysis : Derrick Rose is not better than Ricky Rubio. Don’t do it, Tom. \nSPEAKING OF REUNIONS, HOW ABOUT DERON WILLIAMS AND THE JAZZ? \nThe Utah Jazz are also looking at a potential reunion,, this one involving their former All-Star point guard Deron Williams. \nAccording to ESPN’s Tim MacMahon and Marc Stein, the Jazz have reached out to the Mavericks. No teal was imminent as of Wednesday evening (AEDT). \nThere are complications with regard to the Jazz obtaining Williams, due to his free agent Bird rights, but there’s a mutual interest between the team and player, which could help move things along. \nAnalysis : With the constant injury issue of George Hill and the inconsistent play of Danté Exum, insurance at the point guard position would be smart for the Jazz. One would hardly call the injury-prone Williams ‘insurance’, though, making this a questionable desire by the Jazz. It’s also hard imaging this trade going through without it involving Exum. \nCELTICS ALSO EYEING JIMMY BUTLER \nThe Celtics are in ‘win now’ mode, so they’re going for every big name possible. \nOne of the more prominent players they’re eyeing is Jimmy Butler, whose issues with the Bulls front office have been well-documented. \nAccording to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, the Bulls want a package of ‘pick expected to be in the top five selections, a current starter, and a top prospect in return for Butler.’ Jimmy Butler. Source: AFP \nAnalysis : That pick would likely be the Nets’ 2017 first-rounder, and the starter would likely be either Jae Crowder or Avery Bradley. If the pick has the right protection — potentially top-3 protected — then it may be worth the risk for the Celtics. \nIf the Bulls really are set on getting rid of Butler, their desired package would be a good start to what would be a rebuild. Gar Forman would aim for no protections on the pick, and shouldn’t go ahead with a deal unless he gets that. \nPACERS LOOKING AT JAHLIL OKAFOR \nThe Indiana Pacers have been extremely active in the pursuit to get Paul George help, and they’re going to significant lengths to do just that. \nThey’ve made a first-round pick available, and one name they’ve looked at is 76ers big-man Jahlil Okafor, according to ESPN. \nThe 76ers have been vocal in their desire to trade one of their big-men — whether that’s Okafor or Nerlens Noel — so they’ll likely hear the Pacers out on the offer. \nAnalysis : This trade would make little sense for the Pacers, who already have an impressive young big in Myles Turner, as well as Al Jefferson. By the same token, if the 76ers are able to pry a first-rounder out of the Pacers, that would be a great deal for them. Jahlil Okafor. Source: AP \nBLAKE GRIFFIN UNLIKELY TO BE MOVED \nDoc Rivers made it clear that the Los Angeles Clippers won’t be trading Blake Griffin, but the talks have happened, according to ESPN’s Zach Lowe. \n“[The Celtics and Clippers] talked intermittently with the Clippers about Blake Griffin in recent weeks, per several league sources, but a deal is extremely unlikely,” Lowe wrote. \n“Griffin will be a free agent this summer, and Boston would probably need official permission to talk to him about his future -- a concession Minnesota allowed Cleveland before the Kevin Love trade. \n“The Clips would ask for a bounty, starting with Jae Crowder and one of the Avery Bradley/Marcus Smart duo, plus picks, per league sources.” \nAnalysis : The Clippers could be a great team when healthy, but they just haven’t been able to stay off the injury table this season. Because of that, their record is sub-par, and there’s no telling what impact that’s having on Griffin, who’ll become a free agent in the off-season. If the Clippers are able to get their desired duo, as well as one first-round pick, the deal could be worth it, but it’s clear that Griffin loves Los Angeles, so it’s probably best for the team to trust that he’ll more than likely return. \nThe Celtics clearly want another big name to pair with Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford but, if it means trading away a Jae Crowder or Avery Bradley, that price seems steep. They’d be giving away two of their key perimeter defenders, which would not be worth an expiring contract like Griffin’s. \nPELICANS BEGIN SEARCH FOR GUARDS \nIn order to make a deal for DeMarcus Cousins, the Pelicans had to off-load a plethora of guards. \nBecause of that, they’ve planned workouts with some available backcourt players, according to ESPN’s Marc Stein . \nMario Chalmers, Quinn Cook, Hollis Thompson, and Reggie Williams will be trialling in New Orleans, with at least one of them expected to be picked up. \nThe report claims that general manager Dell Demps will look to fill the spot this week but, if he’s unable to, may wait until March 1, when players on losing teams reach buyouts with their respective clubs. \nAnalysis : The Pelicans got rid of Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, and Buddy Hield in order to make a deal for Cousins. They need backcourt depth, and quick. View All Comments  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:08:07.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
