As the drive-in market died, the home video boom thrived and the direct-to-video exploitation movie was king. Two of the prime movers and shakers of this boom were cult filmmaker David DeCoteau ( Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-o-Rama, Dreamaniac ) and producer Charles Band ( Re-Animator, Arena ) who made so many movies in their combined primes that even they forget how many. But certainly, one of the oddly most beloved of their efforts was the shameless trash 1987 action/horror/sci-fi opus Creepozoids , a flick that actually played select theaters but found its main footing in the VHS rental market. \nBlending key elements of genre hits Mad Max and, of course, Alien and its popular sequel Aliens (while also incorporating elements of Band’s Parasite and Metalstorm ) but produced on a tenth of their budgets, Creepozoids tells the tale of five Army deserters who wander the post-apocalyptic, post-industrial LA landscape seeking shelter from an increasingly toxic environment and poisonous rain. They end up in an abandoned laboratory where they explore, have sex and eventually run afoul of a cavalcade of genetically engineered creatures including mutant rats, a monstrous baby, a massive, bloodthirsty H.R. Giger-esque beast…and something even more malevolent. \nCo-starring adult film superstar Ashlyn Gere – appearing here as Kim McKamy – and horror movie legend Linnea Quigley ( Return of the Living Dead ), Creepozoids is a fun, weird and bloody trash classic and appears now via Band’s Full Moon Features for the first time on Blu-ray (streeting April 11th), remastered and restored from the original 35mm camera negative and armed with a new 5.1 surround sound mix.
