A Vitamin C serum that’s the equivalent of spending a day in the sun, and not inside your office. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Great for: Dull skin that’s prone to visible dark spots, dark circles, etc.\nPromising review: “I just started using this, but I’m already blown away by the results. I had stubborn acne and texture issues that did not change for weeks — months for some places, years for others. No product I added or removed from my routine made a bit of difference. Enter Mad Hippie. In just DAYS, my skin has improved tremendously. My forehead (which was my trouble spot) is clear! I am mystified. Stubborn scars on my cheeks are lightening, as well.” — T. Graves\nGet it from Amazon for $27.19 .\nID: 10406219 2.

This product is very milky and light and cleans my skin without stripping it of its natural oils. My skin is significantly less red, smoother, softer, and I do not get as oily throughout the day. Perfect for sensitive skin types.” — A\nGet it from Michael Todd Beauty for $24 .\nID: 10451103 3. A daily moisturizer that will have your skin saying, “yes, I AM positively radiant.

Uh-huh. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Great for: Dry and sensitive skin, prone to cystic acne.\nPromising review: “I’ve been using this product for over a month now, and it’s perfect for my skin. I’ve been struggling with acne for two years, and I’ve tried numerous products; none of them have helped me as much as this moisturizer! I apply this moisturizer over Viva Naturals Jojoba oil on my face nightly, and it has reduced my acne to the point where I’m not even using my prescription acne gel anymore. I have very sensitive skin, and this product combined with Jojoba oil has completely changed my skin for the better.” — Jimmie Guillaume\nGet it from Amazon for $19.49 .\nID: 10406329 5. A rosehip and hibiscus eye cream with packaging that you’ll want to keep on your nightstand. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Dry patches, crow’s feet, and delicate skin around the eye area.\nPromising review: “I never write reviews, but I LOVE this eye cream! I was on the hunt for something natural without all the chemicals that most products contain. I was impressed with the ingredients and the company philosophy, so I ordered it and decided to give it a try — and I love it! It has a nice consistency that absorbs easily with no fragrance. It is honestly the first eye cream I have used that actually helps the skin under my eyes look moisturized and soft!” — Steph M.\nGet it on Amazon for $15.99 .\nID: 10427306 6. A spot treatment that will EradiKate the evil enemy commonly referred to as a pimple. View this image ›\nsephora.com Good for: Bullies, AKA pimples.\nPromising review: “I had been having horrible breakouts on my forehead and chin, and nothing was helping until I started this treatment. The smell is definitely strong and sometimes lingers even after I wash my face, but I can live with that. This cleared up so much of my acne; it either reduces the size or brings it to a head within two nights. So happy to have found this product!” — fcmRN90\nGet it from Sephora for $26 .\nID: 10435567 7.

View this image ›\namazon.com Good for: Normal-to-dry skin.\nPromising review: “I very rarely write reviews. However, this product blew me away — I’ve been using it for several months now and it’s perfect! I love that it gives me a good amount of moisture without being greasy.

Can also be used for body acne!\nPromising review: “This tea tree scrub has been a lifesaver in reducing my blocked pores and oily skin problems. Taking a generous amount, polish the scrub into your skin and then give yourself at least 5 minutes to bake. You’ll know it works when you feel that eucalyptus-like chill that comes with VapoRub. After a month of use every other day, I’ve seen fantastic results. No more spots or blemishes, and definite improvement on oil control.” — Isolde\nGet it on Amazon for $14.70 .\nID: 10427412 9.

Good for normal, combination, and oily skin.\nPromising review: “This is my second time buying this foam — I really like how clean my face feels after using it! I use this in the evenings after removing my makeup, because I feel it may be a bit too much for the morning. I think it lives up to the ‘deep cleansing’ description; it leaves your pores super clean, and also leaves that tight feeling on your skin. I have combination skin, previously oily skin, so I think this may be too drying if you have dry skin. Affordable and you only need a tiny bit of product, so it lasts a long time!” — C\nGet it on Amazon for $10.95 .\nID: 10427473 10. A healing ointment that will make you say, “new number who dis?” to all the Chapstick that has failed you in the past. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Dry, cracked skin.\nPromising review: “This is the only product for dry skin that actually 100% works every time. Whether you’ve got dry feet, eczema, patches on your body or face, or ANYWHERE, this heavy-duty ointment works wonders when applied overnight. I recommend this to everyone.” — Bonnie G\nGet it on Amazon for $12.25 .\nID: 10436430 11. A Benzoyl Peroxide wash that holds a huge “STOP” sign in the face of incoming acne. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Face and body acne.\nPromising review: “Honestly, the best acne treatment I’ve ever tried. I’ve been using it for a week now and my skin is almost 100% clear of cystic acne and acne scars. I’ve been trying to clear up my skin for MONTHS, and this amazing product was able to do it in about a week. I would recommend it to anyone, but be aware that your skin will become quite dry for at least the first few times you use it.” — Jessica\nGet it from Amazon for $21.95 .\nID: 10428589 12. Coconut oil to help take off your makeup. Believe the coconut oil hype, dear readers. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Moisturizing skin and removing makeup.\nPromising review: “I ordered this to use as a moisturizer on my face, since my skin is very sensitive. I have been very happy with it — it leaves my skin feeling smooth all day. I used to have very dry skin, and would break out with the worst cases of acne on an almost weekly occurrence. I sometimes use the coconut oil in the shower, too. It has a wonderful, light coconut smell and leaves my hair conditioned and moisturized without any buildup.” — Geraldine\nGet it from Amazon for $10.79 — $17.90 .\nID: 10406728 13. A gel-like essence with snail mucine and bee venom that helps regenerate cells and leave redness BEEhind. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Pretty much any skin ailment.\nPromising review: “I’m prone to red, splotchy skin that’s oily in some places and dry in others. At 45, I still get what my dermatologist calls ‘closed comedones,’ and I call them ‘disgusting whiteheads that never go away.’ Well, after a month, my skin looks better than it ever has in my life. I pat this essence on after cleansing and toning. It sinks into my skin quickly, feels lightly moisturizing without being oily, and evens out my red, uneven skin tone. Even the skeevy white bumps are on the run! Also, I have my fifteen-year-old, acne-prone daughter using this and both pimples and their accompanying redness has been majorly reduced. She’s only been using it for a week, so I was amazed by the difference it made.” — KellyinDallas\nGet it from Amazon for $17.55 .\nID: 10428888 14. A black sugar scrub that’ll make you sing “pour some sugar on me” every time you wash your face. theskinfood.us\ntheskinfood.us\n Good for: All skin types that need exfoliation! If you have sensitive skin, just add extra water to the scrub mixture.\nPromising review: “I have tried many face scrubs, from the expensive department store brands to the the inexpensive ones available at drugstores, and none of them left my face feeling as soft and polished as this one. I use it once or twice a week, in between my makeup remover and foaming cleanser.” — Leslie M. Bowman\nGet it from SkinFood for $10 or Amazon for $7.68 .\nID: 10429420 15. A mud mask that is a luxurious alternative to expensive spa visits. A spa treatment with Netflix, if you will. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Enlarged pores, bratty blackheads, and breakouts.\nPromising review: “I’ve only used it once so far, but I really liked the results even after the first use. I typically have oily skin and deal with acne on a day-to-day basis. My daily cleanser tends to dry out my skin and I can’t use moisturizer because it makes me break out more. This mask, however, felt great because my skin felt clean and fresh, but also moisturized and smooth — my acne was visibly less red and looked/felt less swollen; by the next morning it had shrunk half the size.” — The Good Witch\nGet it on Amazon for $17.05 .\nID: 10429169 16. A daily moisturizer with a hint of foundation that provides sheer coverage. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Normal, combination, and oily skin.\nPromising review: “After searching for a moisturizer, a line tamer, and an age spot reducer, I found all three in Olay Total Effects Cream! After three weeks, my facial lines have diminished, my age spots have faded considerably, and my skin is moisturized all day and night. This is truly a wonderful product — so much so that I repurchased eight more bottles after using this product for only one week!” — Mary T. Graffeo\nGet it from Amazon for $13.43 .\nID: 10436455 17. A rose petal witch hazel toner that is so good, it’s magic. Broomstick not included. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Sensitive skin prone to breakouts.\nPromising review: “My skin has never looked better! I received it just three days ago and I’ve used it about four or five times (once before I go to bed, and once when I wake up in the morning). It smells amazing and doesn’t dry out my skin. The before and after pictures speak for themselves — great product and a great price! Top is before and bottom is after.” — Ashley Russell\nGet it from Amazon for $12.24 .\nID: 10406240 18. A deep pore gel cleanser that is like a tea detox for your skin. Except with charcoal. michaeltoddbeauty.com\nmichaeltoddbeauty.com\n Great for: Oily, blemish-prone skin.\nPromising review: “I have purchased five of these over the past year — I’m addicted and love this product!

A spot treatment and drying lotion that says “boy bye” to pesky pimples. View this image ›\nurbanoutfitters.com Good for: Whiteheads.\nPromising review: “I suffer from adult acne and, after just a few uses, I’ve noticed serious improvement in my problem areas. It dries up active spots over night and reduces redness like voodoo. This will now be a staple in my skin routine.” — Ashley\nGet it from Urban Outfitters and Amazon for $17.\nID: 10435692 20. A clay mask that starts to foam upon application. Hello, Loch Ness Monster look-alike and Snapchat opportunities. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Combination skin, gets rid of pore-clogging dirt and oil.\nPromising review: “I am obsessed with this mask — the carbonation feels insane on my face and tingles so much. My snapchat has appreciated this purchase since I always look like a swamp monster when it’s all foamed up.” — Nicole Hallberg\nGet it from Amazon for $10.10 .\nID: 10435680 21. An organic moisturizer cream that will help rejuvenate your skin and give it some much-needed TLC. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Dry skin prone to rosacea and excema.\nPromising review: “I’ve been using Honeyskin on my face for the past two weeks and absolutely love it. My skin is sensitive, with mild rosacea, and I’ve had mild acne for over a decade (occasionally I’d clear it up with various face products, but they always made my skin splotchy red, would cause flareups with the rosacea, or were so drying I’d end up with flaky skin). After two weeks of using this daily, my skin is almost completely clear of any signs of rosacea or acne. Plus, my skin looks dewy and vibrant.” — Rebecca King\nGet it from Amazon for $14.22 .\nID: 10428393 22. A face mask that smells like chocolate cupcakes and mint. Need I say more? lushusa.com\nlushusa.com\n Good for: Oily skin.\nPromising review: “I’m 20, so not exactly a teenager anymore, but I’ve had severe acne for almost half my life. When you have skin like mine (skin that’s so bad that it needs medical intervention), you’re going to want to consult people before you put things on it. I went to my local Lush and a sales rep suggested I use this mask for my acne and large pores. It was far better than I had expected. Within two months, my skin has gone from a sebum war zone to nearly spotless. It smells yummy but refreshing, like an iced mint mocha. Every time I wash this mask off, I immediately feel soft and smooth, and my face looks downright radiant. It’s excellent and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone with acne issues.” — Emma Hall\nGet it from a Lush Cosmetics Store for $9.95 .\nID: 10406293 23. A multi-use oil that will help fade stubborn scarring and even out your complexion. amazon.com\namazon.com\n Good for: Dehydrated and uneven skin, plus acne scars and dark spots.\nPromising review: “I had this product in my ‘save for later’ cart for months. Hesitant to purchase yet another skincare product, I finally took the chance and bought it. Do you know what I dislike about it? That I didn’t buy it SOONER! This product has changed my skin. I’ve been using it now for two months (daily), and I still have the original 4oz bottle that I purchased. It absorbs into my skin nicely, creates smoothness, and doesn’t feel greasy. I suffer from adult acne, and this helps to keep my skin clear and soft. This is now a product that I cannot live without. Best skincare purchase I have EVER made!” — Amazon Customer\nGet it from Amazon for $8.47 .\nID: 10436625 24. An eye cream that I imagine would sing “plump it up, you got to plump it up” at karaoke if given the chance. amazon.com Good for: Dark circles, fine lines, and puffiness. Helps moisturize and plump thin skin around the eyes.\nPromising review: “I’m not a review writer usually, but I had to on this one. First off, as a mom of three, lack of sleep, stress, and age have started to take their toll on my eyes. I was done with dark circles, lines, and tired-looking eyes, and had tried other products with no luck. I tried this product by chance and, wow, I’m never trying anything else. It works! It does not irritate my eyes and in just over a week I got results — I highly recommend it. It’s affordable and works.” — sacmom\nGet it from Amazon for $15.19 .\nID: 10406425 25.

Goodbye, greasy residue! kiehls.com\nkiehls.com\n Good for: All skin types!\nPromising review: “I used to hate sunscreen because it felt heavy and oily, and I felt like my combination skin couldn’t breathe — so I didn’t apply it unless I absolutely had to. But this product has me forever hooked on applying sunscreen! We all know that you should apply sunscreen before you head out to prevent early aging; his product will give you a very good reason to do so.” — CindyinTX\nGet it from Kiehl’s for $38 .\nID: 10445560 26.

My face hasn’t been this clear in a long time.” — Lrkrh3\nGet it from The Body Shop for $20 .\nID: 10435500 27.
