All arrows point to that,\" she says. \"It sounds like a total conspiracy theory and it sounds like bullshit, but all real fans and everybody in the family knows it. It was a setup. It was bullshit.\"\nJackson said her father himself was suspicious of people in his circle. \"He would drop hints about people being out to get him,\" she says. \"And at some point he was like, 'They're gonna kill me one day.'\"\nJackson claims that plenty of people had reason to want him dead, but she's not ready to make accusations quite yet. She does, however, blame his personal doctor, Conrad Murray, for her father's addiction to propofol. Michael Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication in 2009. Conrad was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and served a two-year sentence.\nJustin Bieber, right, and Paris Jackson pose together after the hand and footprint ceremony honoring her father, musician Michael Jackson, in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, Thursday, Jan. 26, 2012.\nImage: AP Photo/Matt SaylesAP\nNow, Jackson is concerned for Justin Bieber, arguably the current successor to her father's throne, whose recent performances remind her of the end of her father's life.\n\"He was tired, going through the motions,\" Jackson says about a stop on Bieber's Purpose tour. \"I looked at my ticket, saw AEG Live, and I thought back to how my dad was exhausted all the time but couldn't sleep.\"\nMichael Jackson was working with concert promoters AEG Live at the time of his death to prepare for \"This Is It\" â€” a 50-night residency in London, and his daughter alleges that his grueling rehearsals were a factor in his untimely passing. \"AEG Live does not treat their performers right,\" she says. \"They drain them dry and work them to death.\"\nThe Jackson family lost a wrongful death suit against the company in 2013.\nBONUS: Sundance Film Festival 2017 recap: Day 2", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/DtEzQi5I.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/DtEzQi5I.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/myNuUopUkrIhI0cjpCAMQeA_Skk=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F360504%2Fa9a7e2f9-f3c9-4ee1-8d27-69184ebe70ac.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPpesBTAwf5/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BNqNOp5ddJpQUWu0uV5lZgqI_bA=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F360504%2Fa9a7e2f9-f3c9-4ee1-8d27-69184ebe70ac.jpg", "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/paris-jackson-michael-jacksons-daughter-speaks-out-w462501"], "published": "2017-01-25T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:24:29.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
