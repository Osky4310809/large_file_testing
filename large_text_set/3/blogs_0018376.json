But what about electric planes? A start-up wants to build a commercial passenger electrified jet that can easily handle up to a 300 mile trip. Of course, that goal is contingent on battery tech continuing to develop at a rapid clip. Advertisement \nWright Electric pitched the idea at this year’s Y Combinator Demo Day, a thing where “prestigious” startups lay out their vision before investors. The company said it’s building a 150-seat plane, with the intention of situating it in the 737-size jet market. \nThe company’s already landed a partner in British airliner EasyJet, according to the BBC , which said Wright Electric’s hope is to send one of its planes from London to Paris in 10 years : Advertisement \nHowever, significant hurdles need to be overcome if Wright Electric is to make the Wright One, pictured above, a reality. \nThe company is relying heavily on innovation in battery technology continuing to improve at its current rate. If not, the firm will not be able to build in enough power to give the plane the range it needs. \nWright Electric isn’t alone, either. Airbus has been cooking up plans for a silent, electric plane since 2014, with the goal of potentially bringing a 90-seater to the market in the future.
