All transition activities are for information gathering purposes, and all discussions are tentative,” Spicer said. \n“I want to reiterate, there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure. It is 100 percent false,” he added. \nSources familair with the planning team told the Wall Street Journal that Trump believes the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has become “bloated and politicized.”   \nCoates, who will soon be serving as the director of national intelligence, just finished a six-year term in the U.S. Senate. Before that, he was the U.S. ambassador to Germany for President George W. Bush. \nU.S. officials familiar with national intelligence claim Coates is “very well respected on both sides of the aisle.” And a Democratic official said the former senator was a “very reasonable guy.” \nSenate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr told reporters that Coates is an “excellent choice.” \n“Dan’s got the experience, he’s got the leadership skills having been an ambassador and I think his time on the committee has served him to understand what that role entails,” Burr said.
