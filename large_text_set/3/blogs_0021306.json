The blood red “Felina” version remembers the final episode when White succumbs to a salvo of gunshots, while the “Blue Sky” edition is a nod to the bright hue of the methamphetamine crystals that Walter peddles in the show.\nBoth colorways are adorned with the recognizable Heisenberg caricature, debossed in gold print on full-grain leather hang tags. BAIT and Breaking Bad branding also feature on the insoles and the reverse side of each leather hang tag. Numbers are limited to 250 of the “Felina” version and 400 of the “Blue Sky” version.\nSubscribe to Highsnobiety’s sneaker chatbot on Facebook to receive lightning quick updates on release dates, sneaker street style, shopping tips and more. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:58:48.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
