I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. I was at your town-hall meeting on Friday. In fact, I was one of the last to get a seat even after arriving over an hour early. I had hoped that I’d be writing you a different type of letter, to be honest. After the town-hall, I still don’t agree with you about health care, the President, Hillary Clinton or really all that much else. Though, I can (and do) respect that fact that you’d hold a town-hall knowing I presume, full-well, that the political winds weren’t blowing in your favor. Agree or disagree, I think it’s important for representatives in our republic to face their constituents and be held accountable for the way they do their job. So, I was going to write to — among other things — thank you for that and to give you my perspective on the state of our country. Congressman, how dare you. I mean, truly. How dare you disrespect the citizens of this state by suggesting for even one moment that we are not who we say that we are and, my goodness — suggest that we’re being paid to express our displeasure with our representation as is our right however we so choose and and, quite frankly, at whatever volume we please. We may not agree on politics, Mr. Chaffetz, but those were my friends and my neighbors in that room. We saw each other in the line that stretched down the side of the school in the hour before the doors were opened. We greeted each other and talked a bit about the state of the country, and our worries and our fears. We talked about how great it was that we could all come out together and participate in some civic engagement in the way that some of us, really, should have started doing long ago. In response, you maligned us — accused us of not even being from our home — without evidence and then uses that accusation as justification for ignoring us. I was not paid to be there, Congressman Chaffetz. Nobody was. You have no evidence for a claim that we were. In Utah, we don’t really mess around as you might have noticed. In fact, we call that sort of statement for what it is —  a lie. You, sir, owe the citizens of the state that you represent a sincere apology. People in that room did not yell because they were paid to do so. They yelled because they are angry. People do that, you know, when they’re frustrated and sad and they’ve had enough. When we see a government working diligently to take away health care legislation that those we love depend on, we’re going to be upset. When we see you trying to claim credit for removing a bill on public-lands that you never should have filed in the first place — our blood pressure goes up and stays up. If you don’t want us to feel angry and let down, consider that you might not be doing the right thing instead of blaming us for our expression of discontent and attempting to spin our anger into a political win for yourself. How dare you. When we see a President that disrespects women, a vice-president who disrespects our LGBTQ friends and a Congress that seems dysfunctional at best and derelict at worse, you had better believe we’re going to raise our voices and we’re going to do it loudly, constantly and wherever we can find you for as long as it takes for you to start listening. Our shouts and our yells may not be civil discourse — but they come from a place of real anger. You may not agree, you may not like it or appreciate it but the one thing you are absolutely not allowed to do is to disregard it. You said you were there to listen. So, listen. Do your job. If you you believe, that those in that room were not your fellow Utahns, it is not because they were not — but because you have lost the ability to recognize us. We recognize you, though, and our shouts are only going to get louder, even if we have to yell loud enough for you to hear them from across the country in Washington, D.C. -Michael Place", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:52:28.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
