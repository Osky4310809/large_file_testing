Sanchez has a great goalscoring record but his running lets him down (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane) Arsene Wenger has criticised Sanchez's work rate in the past (Photo: REUTERS) \nArsenal boss Wenger has been publicly and privately critical of Sanchez’s work rate and contribution to the team. \nAnd now the stats reveal that Wenger might just have a point… \nIncredibly, Stoke’s Peter Crouch covers the most ground with 12.06km per 90 minutes which is nearly three kilometres more than Sanchez.
