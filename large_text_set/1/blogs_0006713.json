With virtual reality, many see porn as one of the more obvious use cases that could lead to heavy headset adoption early-on. \nToday, Pornhub, which is the 50th most visited website on the internet, released some data which shows some of the early success the site has had since introducing a VR porn section to the site in April of 2016. \nThe company claims that there were over 38 million searches for virtual reality videos on PornHub last year. The site has about 1800 VR-optimized videos in its library now. \nInterestingly, the report highlights that VR porn content largely hasn’t taken hold of the United States yet compared to other markets. Here are the top ten countries searching for VR porn on Pornhub: China Egypt Chile \nFor the time being, Pornhub is mainly focusing on Cardboard-based experiences which have a large audience but don’t really offer that premium of an experience. It is a really easy way to get VR in the hands of the masses; the company gave away about 10k pairs of VR goggles as a promotion. \nWebVR, which allows your web browser to power virtual reality experiences, will be a major boon to the immersiveness of VR porn, especially on mobile. Right now stock mobile browsers can’t access the head orientation data needed to let you shift your view in a headset. As a result, VR porn is largely confined to either stereoscopic fixed perspective or downloadable videos that you have to load into native apps. \nAs WebVR is further adopted as a standard, it’s going to be a lot simpler to find high quality virtual cyber smut. \nPornhub is one of many legacy adult entertainment sites tackling virtual reality content. VR porn seems to be one of the few sure-bets in terms of use cases, and furthermore it’s one of the few verticals that will likely remain untouched by the tech titans like Google and Facebook. \n2016 was, in many ways, VR’s inaugural year. There’s a lot to expect in 2017 on the VR front and more popular VR adult entertainment is definitely one of them.
