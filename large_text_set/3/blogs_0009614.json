One of the reasons we are clicking so well is also because the local players have found the right understanding with our imports.\" \nAnderson's thumping header against Perak made him the ninth different player to score for this zipping passing side, affirming the growing belief that Kedah have match winners all over the park. A post shared by Football Malaysia (@footballmalaysia) on Mar 11, 2017 at 8:01am PST \nTan's charges will now take on Premier League overachievers PKNP FC in a quarterfinal tie on March 31/April 1 and April 21/22. \nThe club side overcame Kuantan FA 5-4 in a thrilling encounter to book a berth against their more illustrious opponents, and the Kedah handler acknowledged their prowess. \n\"PKNP have been playing really well and been consistent so far. We will not take any team lightly, and the same goes for them. This is a Cup quarterfinal with so much at stake and we must be at our best again for two big games.\" added Tan. \nThe soft spoken chief will give his players a week break, before they prepare for PKNP clash. \nFor Rizal Ghazali, Khairul Helmi, Baddrol Bakhtiar, Akram Mahinan and Syazwan Zainon, there is no holiday as the five make the journey to report to the Football Association of Malaysia headquarters for the national team centralised training on Monday. \nThey are part of the Malaysian team who will travel to Manila to play the Philippines in a March 22 friendly at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. \nMalaysia's Group B Asian Cup qualifier against North Korea on March 28 has been postponed by the Asian Football Confederation after escalating tensions between both governments, following the death of Kim Jong-Nam, the half-brother of Kim Jong-Un at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13. \nNicolas Anil is a former Malay Mail and Goal.com Malaysia editor/writer who appears on BFM Radio as a football analyst.
