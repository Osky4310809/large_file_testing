(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s phones have been ringing off the hook — literally — since he questioned the link between human activity and climate change .\nThe calls to Pruitt’s main line, (202) 546-4700, reached such a high volume by Friday that agency officials created an impromptu call center, according to three agency employees. The officials asked for anonymity out of fear of retaliation.\nInterns were dispatched to answer some of the incoming calls, according to one employee. At times, calls to that number ended up going to voicemail.\nEPA did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nWhile constituents sometimes call lawmakers in large numbers to express outrage over contentious policy issues, it is unusual for Americans to target a Cabinet official.\nPuritt’s comments on the CNBC program “Squawk Box — that “we need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis” over climate change” — prompted an immediate pushback from many scientists and environment groups.\n[ White House proposes cutting EPA budget by one-fifth, cutting key programs ]\n“I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” Pruitt said.\nThe U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that it is “extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century” — a position reiterated on EPA’s own website.\nOn Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose at a record pace for the second straight year , reaching 401.5 parts per million. The two-year surge in carbon concentrations that took place in 2015 and 2016 has no precedent in the 59 years in which the agency has been tracking the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.\nThere is no immediate evidence that any environmental organizations organized the deluge of calls to the new EPA administrator, but a single comment on Reddit may have helped spur the outpouring of criticism. The post outlined how Pruitt’s opponents could contact his office, writing:\n“Here’s the number to call his office (EPA Office of the Administrator) to offer your feelings about Pruitt’s comments: (202) 564-4700 .
