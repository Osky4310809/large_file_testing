If so, that *might* have something to do with the fact that there’s a Pop Tarts café in New York City . According to Forbes , Kellogg’s NYC — the upscale cereal-only restaurant — has undergone a temporary Pop Tarts makeover for the week of February 21 for those of you are more interested in sharing sweet snacks with a special someone rather than joining your date at a cereal bar .\nNot that there’s anything wrong with making kissy faces over a bowl of fancy Frosted Flakes, but it’s nice to have to options, ya know? Anyway, the city that never sleeps is making sure absolutely no one gets any shut-eye around those parts. This Pop Tarts menu is the fastest route to a sugar high, if getting hyped up on a ton of ridiculously sweet toaster treats sounds like your idea of fun.\nAaand it should, because holey moly, get a load of all this YUM: Pop-Tarts milkshakes, burritos, and pizza? Yes. This is happening. Pop-Tarts Café is taking over @kelloggsnyc Times Square this week! #PopTartsCafe \nA post shared by Pop-Tarts (@poptartsus) on Feb 21, 2017 at 6:59am PST \nAt $1 a pop, patrons can choose from 20 Pop Tarts flavors, or they can go the adventurous route by sampling some of the more, er, innovative menu items. For example, $12 will get you a serving of Pop Tarts burritos with a side of kiwi salsa and frosting “sour cream.”\nPoptart Burrito: strawberry frosted poptart w/ fresh strawbs & choco chips wrapped in a tortilla (crepe), with salsas (berries & kiwis) and sour cream (frosting).

Fresh out of the toaster today until Sunday Feb 26 at Kellogg's NYC.
