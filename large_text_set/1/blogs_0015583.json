That streak will end this Sunday. \nThe Pittsburgh Steelers come to town fresh off an easy 30-12 victory against the Dolphins in the Wild Card round, while the Chiefs enjoyed their bye. \nDue to an incoming ice storm in the Kansas City area, the NFL had to reschedule the game from 1:05 p.m. ET to 8:20 p.m. ET. \nThat doesn’t exactly mean KC is healthy and rested. The Chiefs and Steelers both have some of their top players on the injury report this week. \nBen Roethlisberger was in a walking boot, Justin Houston remains questionable with a knee injury, Spencer Ware has sore ribs, Eric Berry injured his heel in Week 17, and Ladarius Green is still in concussion protocol. Aside from Green, all are expected to play but their effectiveness remains to be seen. \nIt’s a lot for Kansas City to worry about as it seek its first AFC Championship appearance since 1994, but it has more than enough playmakers on both sides of the ball to cover it. Tyreek Hill has emerged as an all-around star, but his return abilities on special teams have certainly set him apart. Travis Kelce is living up to his billing as “Baby Gronk,” tallying 85 catches this season for more than 1,100 yards with four touchdowns, but most importantly converting a team-high 55 first downs. And that’s to say nothing of Alex Smith , whose season rating of 91.2 is six points higher than his career average, or a KC defense that led the league with 33 takeaways. \nPittsburgh was one of the most sacked teams this season (38), meaning the Chiefs will look to exploit the Steelers offensive line and pressure Roethlisberger into passes the defense can jump on.\nThat’ll create plenty for the Steelers to plan for even with the uber-talented duo of Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell playing their best football all season.\nWhen these two teams met back in Week 4 in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger torched Kansas City’s defense for five touchdowns en route to a 43-14 victory. That shouldn’t be the case again, though the Steelers are riding an eight-game winning streak.\nWith so many explosive players, Kansas City and Pittsburgh should give NFL fans an entertaining Divisional round game this Sunday.\nThe game will kick off Sunday’s slate, starting at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC.
