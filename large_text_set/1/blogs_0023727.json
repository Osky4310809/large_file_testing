Google first mentioned the 2.0 upgrade back at Google I/O 2016, letting us know that compatible devices would receive the big update “before the end of the year.” Although the launch date has since been postponed, it looks like we don’t have much longer to wait; a recent tweet from a reliable leaker claimed that Google would release Android Wear 2.0 on February 9 , only a few weeks away.\nAfter we heard that news, a separate report was published, claiming that Google would release two new LG-manufactured Android Wear devices alongside the upgrade to version 2.0. Those watches, dubbed LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, have now been shown off in a new, leaked image:\n\nThese new images come from TechnoBuffalo , citing unnamed sources. The chunkier watch on the left is the LG Watch Sport, while the more compact wearable on the right is the LG Watch Style. While TechnoBuffalo wasn’t able to obtain any more info about these two devices, we still have a pretty good idea as to what both watches will feature on the hardware front.\nThe Watch Sport is said to come with a 1.38-inch 480 x 480 OLED display, 768MB of RAM, a 430mAh battery and an IP68 rating. The Watch Sport is definitely the beefier model of the two, as it also comes with 3G and LTE connectivity, as well as GPS and NFC for mobile payments with Android Pay. The Watch Style, on the other hand, will come with a 1.2-inch 360 x 360 OLED display, 512MB of RAM, a 240mAh battery and an IP67 rating. The Watch Style will also have interchangeable straps.\nBoth devices will feature the Google Assistant, 4GB of on-board storage, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even a new digital crown button that serves as another way to navigate around the Android Wear interface.\nAs previously stated, we’ll get a better look at the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style when they’re officially announced on February 9.
