Typical [Spurs chairman] Daniel Levy! \n“It was very hard to negotiate but, at the end of the day, we got it through and, ever since he joined us, he’s had a fantastic career.\" \nA Geordie by birth, Carrick was snapped up by West Ham at the age of 16 and went on to play with the Hammers until 2004, before his move to Spurs. \nHe spent two years at White Hart Lane before Ferguson picked him up - and the 75-year-old said that he knew straight away that he was going to be a big signing.
