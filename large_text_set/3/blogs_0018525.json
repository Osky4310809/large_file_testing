Simply called the iPad, the new tablet is priced at $329 and will replace the ageing iPad Air 2 in the company’s iPad lineup. \nTo keep its price point in check, the new iPad features all the older hardware from Apple. So, we are looking at a 9.7-inch Retina Display and an A9 chip. The display is brighter than what is found on the iPad Air 2, but it does not support Apple Pencil or features a Smart Connector. \n“iPad is the world’s most popular tablet. Customers love the large, 9.7-inch display for everything from watching TV and movies, to surfing the web, making FaceTime calls, and enjoying photos, and now it is even more affordable,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “New customers and anyone looking to upgrade will love this new iPad for use at home, in school, and for work, with its gorgeous Retina display, our powerful A9 chip, and access to the more than 1.3 million apps designed specifically for it.” \nOther specs of the tablet remain the same as the iPad Air 2: 10-hour battery life, Touch ID, Wi-Fi ac/LTE configurations, 8MP rear shooter, 1.2MP FaceTime HD camera, and up to 128GB of storage space. The new tablet is thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 though. \nUnlike the iPad Pro, the new iPad does not feature quad stereo speakers. The tablet will be available in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray colors, with the Apple logo surprisingly being white in all the models. \nThe new 9.7-inch iPad will be available in the US from Friday, March 24 for $329 for the Wi-Fi model, with the Wi-Fi + LTE variant being priced at $459. It will also be available in more than 20 countries from April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:26:53.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
