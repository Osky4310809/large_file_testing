'Cementing dynastic rule' \nAzerbaijan's embattled opposition angrily criticised Aliyeva's elevation as undemocratic and called it a ploy to cement the Aliyev family's dynastic rule. \n\"The move throws Azerbaijan back to medieval, feudal times,\" opposition leader Isa Gambar of Musavat party told the AFP news agency . Azerbaijan votes on boosting presidential powers \n\"Family rule has no place in the 21st century,\" he added. \nThe president, 55, cruised to a third five-year term against limited opposition in 2013, extending his family's rule into a third decade. \nSupporters have praised the Aliyevs for turning a republic once considered a Soviet backwater into a flourishing energy supplier to Europe. \nBut critics argue they have crushed all opposition and used their power to amass a fortune for the president and his family. \nActivists have raised concerns over Azerbaijan's poor rights record, with Human Rights Watch in May blasting the country for a ruthless crackdown that has seen political activists and critical journalists jailed. Lavish lifestyle \nKnown for her love of luxury, Aliyeva featured prominently in US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks, one of which dubbed her \"a first lady, too, in fashion\". \n\"First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva appears to have had substantial cosmetic surgery, presumably overseas, and wears dresses that would be considered provocative even in the Western world,\" the leaked 2010 cable said. \nAn eye doctor by training, she has also authored a dissertation on the ethical aspects of mercy killing. \nIn 2004, she was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations culture agency, UNESCO.
