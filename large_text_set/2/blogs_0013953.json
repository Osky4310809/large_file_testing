But this year, the annual event will certainly be clouded by the dark shadow of our national political situation. We have already been hearing many celebrities speaking out against Trump's agenda.Some are taking action, too. United Talent Agency canceled its Academy Awards party and will donate to American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) instead. With the amount of money pumped into these star-studded events, and the sheer amount of money held by its participants, it is a key opportunity to turn that influence into a force for good in these dark times. Please sign this petition to urge Vanity Fair to turn its Oscars party into a fundraiser that would benefits groups fighting for our civil liberties under Trump. Oscar contenders are already being negatively impacted by Trump's policies. Raed Saleh, the leader of the volunteer Syria Civil Defense group, which was featured in the Oscar-nominated documentary \"The White Helmets,\" was initially thought to be unable to attend the show because of Trump's immigration ban, which has been suspended by the courts.Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian director of the Oscar-nominated \"The Salesman,\" and the movie's star, Taraneh Alidoosti, who is also from Iran, announced they will not attend the ceremony in protest of Trump's immigration ban. Please sign this petition to urge Vanity Fair to use it influence for good, and turn its Oscars party into a fundraiser that would benefits groups fighting for our civil liberties under Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:07:44.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
