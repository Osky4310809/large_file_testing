It’s pretty much what Netflix was created for — to help us get through the tough times. Studies show that our generation has fallen so hard for Netflix that we have little to no interest in watching cable TV anymore. 66 percent of people say that Netflix is their number one video platform. On average, people between ages 13-24 watch 8.8 hours of Netflix a week . We simply can’t live without it.\nWhen we get home after a stressful day, though, the last thing we want to do is apply a chunk of brain power to choosing which movie to watch pre-bedtime. There are more than 13,000 choices worldwide , and after you’ve just spent an hour fighting traffic and bickering with your mom on the phone, the last thing you want to do is rake through all the options until your brain goes fuzzy and your pizza has gone cold. That’s why we’ve compiled this list of feel-good, heartfelt movies that will restore your faith in humanity and give you something to laugh at (or pleasantly cry over) on a weeknight.\nHere are 14 Netflix movies that will get you through the week.\n1. In Your Eyes Couple things: Michael Stahl-David is one of the cutest, most squeal-worthy guys in Hollywood, but you just don’t know it yet; paranormal love stories are the next big thing in the rom com field; and indie flick In Your Eyes deserved way more recognition than it actually got. This romance will make even the most cynical of individuals smile from ear to ear.\n2. Justin Timberlake and the Tennessee Kids Do you love Justin Timberlake? Do you love music? Even if you have no soul and answered no to both of these questions, you will enjoy this fun documentary, which Esquire named as one of the top 25 best movies of 2016 .\n3. Dope Hilarious, soulful, and relevant, this coming of age dramedy will make you laugh as well as give you some insight into those compelling stories that are rarely told in Hollywood.\n4. The Princess Bride This classic is a must-see if you haven’t already fallen in love with it, and if you’re already acquainted with it, get ready to fall head over heels all over again. Because #WestleyandButtercupforever.\n5. Jenny’s Wedding Katherine Heigl and Alexis Bledel are super cute together and they’re getting married, but the former’s family isn’t exactly stoked about the situation. But love is love is love is love, as Lin Manuel Miranda has said, and a midweek dose of love is exactly what you need.\n6. Amélie Behold one of the cutest lead characters ever created in the history of Hollywood. Amélie is whimsical, full of happiness, and French as can be — basically everything you need to get through hump day evening.\n7. Big Eyes Amy Adams dazzles (as usual) in this film, which is a true story about a talented artist whose creepy husband took the credit for all of her work. As upsetting as parts of it may be, it’s got a happy ending, so don’t worry. You won’t go to bed in a bad mood.\n8. Clueless Come on, it’s Clueless . Nothing more needs to be said. It’ll make your life a whole lot easier.\n9.
