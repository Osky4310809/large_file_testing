LEGO Marketing Manager Lise Dydensborg made the announcement yesterday:\n\n“A big congratulations to 20tauri on becoming the next official LEGO Ideas fan designer! As a science editor and writer, with a strong personal interest for space exploration as well as the history of women in science and engineering, Maia Weinstock’s Women of NASA project was a way for her to celebrate accomplished women in the STEM professions. In particular those who’ve made a big impact through their work at NASA.\nWe’re really excited to be able to introduce Maia’s Women of NASA set for its inspirational value as well as build and play experience.”\nThe next step in the process is for an actual LEGO set to be created around the ideas originally submitted, so we can probably expect some extra bells and whistles to really give these women the LEGO tribute they deserve. We can’t wait to see what they come up with.\n(image via LEGO Ideas )\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
