Trump, Turx points out, was always very generous with his time for the young reporter. \nSo when the president - who had already faced a barrage of questions about his ties to Russia, the resignation of his national security adviser and his self-perceived mistreatment by the media - scanned the room full of reporters, he spotted Turx, whose Twitter handle @JakeTurx was on his kippah. \n\"Watch how friendly he is,\" Trump told everyone, hoping to get a softball question. And, he did. Anti-Semitic attacks \nTurx says he prefers not to ask questions about anti-Semitism, because it's simply too obvious, but the story of threats against Jewish Community Centers (JCC) in the US wasn't getting the coverage he'd hoped. \n\"People weren't talking about it and I'd gotten a lot of requests and private messages from teachers and faculty members at various JCCs around the country begging me to bring up the issue,\" Turx says. \nThere were reports of 48 threats against Jewish community centres across the country in January alone. The New York City Police Department reported a doubling in the same month of hate crimes against Jewish citizens. \nSo Turx identified himself, then started with a statement: \n\"Despite what some of my colleagues have been reporting, I haven't seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone else, anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic,\" he said politely. \nAnd then, the statement that changed everything: \n\"However, what we are concerned about and what we haven't really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.\" \nAfter mentioning reports of bomb threats, Trump had heard enough. WATCH: America\\'s media under Trump - An ominous start \n\"You see, he said he was going to ask a simple easy question. And it's not,\" the president huffed. \nTurx was baffled. \"I was trying to figure out, 'what did I do wrong?'\" he explains now. \"Did I say the wrong word?\" \nApparently, he did. Trump told him to sit down. \n\"I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life,\" he said. \nTurx tried to interject in an attempt to clarify that had not meant to accuse the president of anti-Semitism. \n\"Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!\" Trump told him. â€œSee? He lied about. He was going to get up and ask a straight, simple question.\" \nTurx sat down, puzzled by the exchange. But his place in history was now firmly cemented. \nThe messages of support and hatred poured in. His Twitter feed lit up, earning 10,000 more followers. \nThe back-and-forth played across the world on social media and fed into a perception that, rightly or wrongly, already existed: Trump wasn't taking the threats seriously. \nIn January, the White House faced condemnation for failing to mention, in a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the six million Jews who died. \nFive days after his moment with Turx, Trump finally addressed the issue during a visit to the National Museum of African-American History in Washington, DC. \n\"The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centres are horrible and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,\" he said. \nThe next day, Vice-President Mike Pence visited a Jewish cemetery in St Louis that had been vandalised and helped clean it up. \n\"There is no place in America for hatred, prejudice, or acts of violence, or anti-Semitism,\" he said. \nTurx shrugs off the role he played in sparking all of this. The father of three who grew up in both Los Angeles and New York would rather be talking about the budget or school vouchers but he's fully aware that sometimes you just have to go there. \n\"If you're a dentist and you have to pull out the tooth of a child, you just pull out that tooth,\" he says of his memorable moment with the commander-in-chief. \"You do your job and stay honest to the people you are out there working on behalf of.\" Source: Al Jazeera News Content on this website is for general information purposes only.
