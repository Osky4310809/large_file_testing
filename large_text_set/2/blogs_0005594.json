The antagonist managed to chop her hand off after a battle with Gamora and hijacked a spacecraft to put some distance between her and Ronan’s mad mission. Later this year, the character will make a comeback in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , and fans are understandably curious about what Nebula has been up to. So, of course, ComicBook.com sussed out the answer from Gillan herself. \nDuring a set visit, the actress took time to speak with our site about where Nebula finds herself in the sequel. And, according to Gillan, Nebula returns to the big screen with more than one mission. \n“She's on a mission to sort of rectify that because she's missing a hand,” Gillan said, referring to the fallout of her character’s fight with Gamora. \nGoing on, Gillan also revealed Nebula is ona mission to reunited with her adopted sister. “She's also on a mission to find Gamora and rectify a few things there as well and we're going to find out a lot about their back story and learn a lot about Thanos's parenting skills and maybe how dysfunctional the entire thing is. So we're going to chip away at those layers, which is really fun.” \nFor Gillan, the actress thinks Nebula’s desire to reach out to Gamora will instill in fans the idea that the character isn’t as cold as she first appeared. “When you understand anyone's motivations for anything, I think you can empathize with them and that's exactly the case with Nebula here,” she said. “That's what I'm really excited about as an actress, because I want to empathize with my characters. And yeah, I think people might even feel a little bit sorry for her, if it's possible.” \nHowever, if you are expecting Nebula to pull a total turnaround, don’t hold your breath. It doesn’t seem like the character will be going around to pick daisies anytime soon. “I hope people will understand her a little bit more, but…her default is very pissed off and that's not going to change,” Gillan stressed. \nSet to the backdrop of ‘Awesome Mixtape #2,’ Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team’s adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill’s true parentage.
