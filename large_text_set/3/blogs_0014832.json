But you kept lying to the people that you have killed 60 of our people, that you succeded in arresting 20 of our men. That you even rescued 5000 of your people. \n”Why all these lies? Paul Biya, why are you lying? Is this how to convince your masters, the whitemen who are pigs and children of monkies? \n”Lies! Lies every day, you better be careful, Paul Biya because you are not fighting Shekau but God. It would have been easy for you to fight Shekau not God. This thing is beyond your imagination even though you underrated our strength you cannot joke with the holy Quran, prophet’s hadith and the religion of Allah. No! No! No! \n”Buhari, I’m very much sure that you have learnt your lessons by now. You have really learned your lessons but you can still continue if you like. Remember that nobody has ever done bad and gotten away with it. \n”By Allah, all your deception and lies to Nigerians that you are doing them good will not help you. Following the steps of America, Britain or practising democracy and educating children with Western education will equally not do you good. \n”I rather not wish you bad but let me urge you to seek Allah’s forgiveness and repentance. Accept the real teaching of the Islam by not only depending on fasting, salat, zakkat and Hajj. \n”It’s not my saying because religion is ideology which is based on practicing the Quran and its laws. I better not make too much talk. Niger Republic President Muhammadu Yusufu you are a liar. You can’t dare my students and if I rise against you it will be difficult for you to face me. \n”Just remember that as long as we are Muslims and we practice the injunction of the Holy Quran we will be powerful. This is not something you can play with. Stop saying Boko Haram people are jobless because your propaganda will not help you in the presence of Allah.” \nThis is my warning to you all. By the way, this message was meant for my brothers in Islam to remind them to remain resilient and dedicated towards the struggle. I assured them that the struggle is not shaken or weakened in anyway. \nAll the explosions in Maiduguri are carried out by us and we will continue to detonate bombs. In fact, you will never have rest of mind until you accept the holy Quran.
