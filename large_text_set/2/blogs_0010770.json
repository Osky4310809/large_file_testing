By Deni Rose M. Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated February 14, 2017 - 10:56am John Lloyd Cruz (third from right) with the cast of \"Home Sweetie Home\" ABS-CBN/Released \nMANILA, Philippines — “Guys, nakainom ba ka kayo? Guys, lasing ba kayo?” actor John Lloyd Cruz, fondly called JLC, told Philstar.com in jest when asked how is he going through Valentine’s Day as a member of Lonely Hearts Club. \n“Love is a propaganda! Love is a scam! Love is a scandal!” he declared when asked to define love. “I think, lahat naman ng tao may kanya-kanyang definition ng love. ‘Yun lang naman ang sinasabi ko… Sa ngayon, ‘pag tinanong mo talaga ako about love, talagang mahirap s’yang sagutin dahil hindi pa s’ya dumarating ngayon. Siguro, kapag dumating na s’ya, masasagot ko na yung tanong na ‘What is love?’” \nHe stressed that he has no date this Valentine’s, and he is not dating anyone. \nWhen quizzed about what happened to his past relationships, he pleaded: “’Wag na natin balikan 'yung past. Pero ‘di naman ibig sabihin na walang halaga o walang pagmamahal 'yung nakaraaan. It’s just that siguro, sa bawat pag-ibig na mararanasan mo sa buhay mo, may iba-iba, may kanya-kanya silang ibig sabihin. May kanya-kanya silang dahilan.” \nJLC, though, will be on a comeback movie with Sarah Geronimo and a movie or a soap opera with ex-girlfriend Bea Alonzo. \nHe found it ridiculous to have “A Third Chance” as a follow-up to his and Bea’s “A Second Chance,” since for him, “once is enough” and twice is already too much. \n“It will be exciting to do something totally different kasing ibang tao na rin si Bea ngayon. It will be really interesting to come up with a totally fresh material.” \nFor now, he gets all the love he needs from his “Home Sweetie Home” family, which recently marked its third anniversary. The sitcom reminds him of television soap “Tabing Ilog,” which ran for five years. \n“Home Sweetie Home,” for him, does not feel like work because he looks forward to seeing his co-actors often. “You care not only about your dialogues and script, but also with your co-workers.” \nThrough the years, the series has changed dynamics since his co-star, Toni Gonzaga, got married and had a child, but these helped him and the creative team to come up with a weekly material since the program is about a modern family. \n“We’re always here to understand and support Toni,” he assured. “Siguro, kung dadating din sa ‘kin yung ganung pagkakataon, alam ko na may suporta rin akong makukuha sa pamilyang ‘to, kagaya ng suportang binibigay namin kay Toni.” \nHis wish for Hearts’ Day? \n“I hope, this Valentine’s Day, makapagbigay tayo ng ibang ibig sabihin sa araw ng mga puso. Meaning, siguro, ‘di lang naman na-create ang Valentine’s Day para sa mga taong may partner o may mga jowa, may mga girlfriend o boyfriend. Siguro, in our own ways, pwede nating hilingin yung mas profound na meaning ng Valentine’s Day na hindi kinakailangan na mayroon kang kahawak-kamay o kayakap.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:02:22.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
