Pjanic has the top corner picked out perfectly from the free-kick, but Handanovic flies through the air and parries it onto the bar! Remarkable goalkeeping! 43' Yellow Card Gary Alexis Medel SotoMedel does pick up a booking, however, and this one must be for dissent. 43' Gagliardini tests his luck one too many times, but the referee has yet to brandish the yellow card, as the midfielder slides in with a late challenge into the back of Mandzukic, just outside the penalty area. Real chance for Juventus to snatch the lead here in the dying embers of the first half. 41' STAT: Mauro Icardi has scored seven goals in eight Serie A appearances against Juventus, his favourite target in the Italian top-flight. Three of these goals came at the Juventus Stadium. 39' CHANCES AT BOTH ENDS! Nearly indentical ones at that, too, as Mandzukic and Icardi both direct cleverly disguised shots toward the far post, but neither effort is able to hit the target with both keepers beaten! What a first half this has been! 37' CHAOS! First Buffon produces a fine reactionary stop to deny Perisic's header, then Icardi is taken to ground by Mandzukic near the byline, but his appeals for a penalty are denied as Inter are forced to settle for another corner! 35' Play is being contained in midfield here, but there's a real tenacity about these two sides. Inter don't look at all intimidated in the face of the league leaders, sticking to their game rather admirably. 33' STAT: Juventus have won each of their last 27 home Serie A games (new record in the history of the Italian top-flight) and have scored in each of the last 29 (66 goals in total). 31' WIDE! Medel nowhere near where he needs to be as a strong cross in from the left finds the run of Higuain, but the striker directs his first-time effort wide of the far post! Chances at both ends here but still we await the breakthrough. 29' STRAIGHT AT BUFFON! Another inviting delivery played in by Perisic on the left, picking out the head of Gagliardini, but the midfielder is put under a bit of pressure and can only send a tame header into the waiting arms of Buffon! That's not who Inter want that chance to be falling to. 27' Ambitious attempt by Cuadrado, and a wasteful one at that following some strong play from Khedira to win the ball back in midfield. The ex-Chelsea winger tries his luck from 30 yards and a difficult angle out wide, missing the target by a fair distance. 25' Inter clearly on top here as they continue to take the game to the league leaders. This has been an intensely contested affair up to this point, and Inter have fighting spirit in spades tonight. Pioli's troops are certainly up for the occasion. 23' Yellow Card Miralem PjanićPjanic goes hard through the front of Brozovic and that will see him into the book. One yellow apiece now for Juventus and Inter. 22' IT'S COMING CLOSER! Buffon puffs his cheeks and lets out a sigh of relief as Joao Mario barely misses the far corner with his strike from the top of the box! Inter continue to grow in stature here. 21' STAT: Inter are on a seven-game winning streak in Serie A: the last time they have won eight league games in a row was in December 2008, under Jose Mourinho. 19' BARELY OVER! Two shouts for an Inter penalty following a corner as D'Ambrosio and Icardi are wrestled to ground, but they're ambitions appeals at best. The ball does fall kindly for Gagliardini, however, but his first-time effort from 10 yards cannons agonisingly over the bar! 17' Inter are settling in nicely, adopting a more patient approach in possession as they continue to weather the early storm of pressure being applied by Juventus. They're looking confident and composed as they pass it around near the halfway line. 15' This has been some excellent viewing through the opening quarter of an hour. Inter will have been aware of the success Juve have had early in matches this season, so they will be thrilled to not only have made it through the first 15 minutes unscathed, but offering a real threat themselves. 13' OFF THE BAR! Stunning bit of interplay from the hosts, with a lovely little touch from Pjanic to tee up Dybala. The striker had Handanovic beaten with a cleverly dinked strike, but it rattles off the frame of the goal! 11' STAT: Juventus have scored the most goals in the opening 15 minutes of play (10), and have won 17 of the 18 games in which they have been leading (losing the other one right against Inter). 9' Has to be better! Joao Mario surges forward on a probing run and has Candreva in acres of space to his right, but doesn't spot him! He instead plays it over for Perisic on the left, and then the Croatian's attempt to tee up Brozovic for a shot goes awry... and Juve can counter. 7' Yellow Card Antonio CandrevaJuventus are unable to create much with the first corner of the match, and then Inter reply with an equally disappointing delivery from a corner of their own. The hosts break quickly through Dybala, who is hacked down rather physically by Candreva, who is issued an early yellow card. 5' Inter's high pressing is causing one or two problems for the Juventus defenders, but the hosts are doing very well in midfield to move the ball quickly. It's been end to end action as a result in these opening stages, a tempo we can only hope will continue throughout. 3' SENSATIONAL STOP! Good early pressure from the Nerazzurri, who get forward straight away and work the Juventus backline via a ball over the top from Perisic. Juventus defend the threat and get back the other way, with Dybala's stunning overhead kick, following a mistake from D'Ambrosio, prompting an absolutely brilliant save from Handanovic! 1' AND THEY'RE OFF! Inter kick-off, attacking right to left, in front of an incredibly spirited atmosphere inside the Juventus Stadium! Just one change has been applied to the Inter team from the lopsided victory over Pescara last weekend, which prompts a switch in formation. Gary Medel comes in to form a back-three, with Yuto Nagatomo dropping to the bench. Antonio Candreva and Danilo D'Ambrosio act as wing-backs, while Joao Mario and Ivan Perisic flank striker Mauro Icardi. Massimiliano Allegri trots out the same XI from the 2-0 victory over Sassuolo a week ago. Gonzalo Higuain leads the line again, supported by the fearsome trio of Mario Mandzukic, Paulo Dybala and Juan Cuadrado. It's possible that they switch to three at the back if need be, with Stephan Lichtsteiner moving to centre-half, pushing Alex Sandro forward and Cuadrado a bit deeper. SUBS: Carrizo, Andreolli, Kondogbia, Palacio, Biabiany, Ansaldi, Banega, Santon, Eder, Nagatomo, Barbosa, Pinamonti. INTER (3-4-3): Handanovic; Murillo, Medel, Miranda; Candreva, Gagliardini, Brozovic, D'Ambrosio; Mario, Perisic, Icardi. SUBS: Neto, Audero, Alves, Rugani, Benatia, Asamoah, Marchisio, Rincon, Sturaro, Mandragora, Pjaca. JUVENTUS (4-2-3-1): Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Chiellini, Sandro; Khedira, Pjanic; Cuadrado, Dybala, Mandzukic; Higuain. CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS: The Derby d’Italia is big enough as is, but there’s much more on the line tonight than there has been in recent meetings between the pair. Anything but three points for Juventus would lead to some real congestion at the top of the table, while Inter need to prove to the world, and themselves, that they are legitimate top-three contenders. Here we are now, four months later, and Juventus remain at the summit, consistently fighting off their closest title challengers. Inter, however, have stormed back into the mix with seven successive victories under the tutelage of Stefano Pioli. The victory didn’t spark any drastic change in league form, however, as Inter would go on to win just one of their next five Serie A matches, eventually firing boss Frank de Boer, while it proved nothing more than a minor blip for Juventus, who went on to continue their scorching pace. In the reverse fixture this season in Milan, Inter bagged late goals from Mauro Icardi and Ivan Perisic to come from behind and beat Juventus 2-1 at San Siro, ending a lengthy drought without a league win over the Bianconeri.
