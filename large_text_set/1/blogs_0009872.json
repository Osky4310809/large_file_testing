BHO got Nobel prize at start of presidency before accomplishing anything. Biden got medal of freedom at end after accomplishing nothing. \n— Brit Hume (@brithume) January 13, 2017 \nDoes it get any better than that? Obama got his Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for literally nothing. Not only was 2009 the year he was sworn in, he’d only held the post for 12 days by the time the nomination window closed for prizes that year, according to Fox News report from the time. \nMeanwhile, according to CNN , Biden had absolutely no idea the medal was coming. “I don’t deserve this,” he told Obama.

The man has done literally nothing to advance the cause of freedom – though keeping his heart beating for the sake of presidential continuity deserves some credit. \n(Think about it. If Obama had somehow passed from the scene between 2008 and 2010, Nancy Pelosi would have been right behind Biden in the order of succession. Compared to Crazy Nancy, Creepy Uncle Joe is a bargain.) \nAnd this wasn’t just any old presidential Medal of Freedom. There are some big winners for science and philanthropy, of course, but in the Obama Era, fame and a fat checkbook open to Democrat candidates is as good a way of winning one as any. This year alone, other recipients have included actors Tom Hanks, Robert DeNiro, as well as comedienne Ellen DeGeneres and rock star Bruce Sprinsteen. All good, famous, rich Democrats. \nWhat Obama gave Biden was a Medal of Freedom “with distinction,” a class of the medal previously won by only three people, Pope John Paul II (now a saint), former President Ronald Reagan, and former General and Secretary of State Colin Powell. Can even the craziest liberal pretend Joe Biden belongs in that kind of company?
