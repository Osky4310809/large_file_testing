The chart trek follows the set’s release to multiple physical formats on Jan. 13 (after its original Dec. 24 digital-only release which spurred a No. 8 debut on the Jan. 14 chart), with sales now swelling 701 percent, to 17,000 copies sold in the week ending Jan. 19, according to Nielsen Music – the duo’s best sales week ever. \nIt’s the fourth charting album for Run the Jewels on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and second to reach the top 10, following the No. 9-peaking Run the Jewels 2 in 2014. \nThe new album also debuts at No. 1 on the Vinyl Albums chart, with 7,000 copies sold of the format, marking the group’s first No. 1 on the list. It’s the fourth top 10 on the Vinyl Albums chart for Run the Jewels. \n[embedded content] \nMultiple flashy retail bundles of the album were made available on the group’s website, including gold vinyl packages that include the CD and a t-shirt. In addition, a cassette tape version of the set was sold exclusively at Urban Outfitters and at Run The Jewels live shows. In total, the album has sold 41,000 copies since its Dec. 24 release. \nOn the multi-metric Billboard 200 chart (which blends traditional sales with TEA/SEA equivalent units), Run The Jewels 3 bounds 106-13, reaching its highest position on the overall genre list, with 20,000 equivalent units earned. The title was already the highest-charting effort for Run the Jewels, when it debuted at No. 35 on the Jan. 14-dated list (surpassing the No. 50 peak of Run the Jewels 2 in 2014). \nThe duo concurrently debuts at No. 29 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, which measures the week’s most popular artists across all genres. \n[embedded content] \nSocial Club Misfits Bow: Elsewhere on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, Miami-based Christian hip-hop duo Social Club Misfits arrive at No. 6, earning the Hot Shot Debut, with The Misadventures of Fern & Marty (5,000 copies sold). The set concurrently bows at No. 4 on Rap Albums and No. 2 on Top Christian Albums, the pair’s highest peak on either chart. \nThree album tracks dot the Hot Christian Songs chart; “Pop Out Revenge,” featuring Amari, re-enters at No. 32 (it previously spent one week at No. 46 on the Dec. 10 chart), while “Vibes Vibes Vibes,” featuring Aha Gazelle and Chris Durso, arrives at No. 37, and “Who Else,” featuring Andy Mineo, debuts at No. 28. \n[embedded content] \nPnB Rock Debuts: Lastly, rapper PnB Rock bows at No. 10 on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums with his debut studio set, GTTM: Goin Thru The Motions (4,000 copies sold). The 25-year-old Philadelphia native arrived on the Billboard charts in November when “Selfish” debuted on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The track remains on the chart for a 13th straight week, with its best streaming week yet (7.1 million domestic streams in the week ending Jan. 19). \nThe song rises 20-17 on the Rap Streaming Songs chart, reaching a new peak. To date, “Selfish” has amassed over 87 million on-demand audio and video streams in the U.S. PnB Rock also arrives with a No. 85 debut on the Billboard Artist 100 chart.
