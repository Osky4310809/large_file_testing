Chief says police must focus on those who pose physical threat Police are at \"saturation point\" dealing with a huge increase in abuse cases, the head of child protection said Share Up to half a million men in Britain watch images of child sex abuse, a report claimed Share Get daily   \nPaedophiles who are caught watching images of child sex abuse should not face criminal action, a senior police officer has argued. \nSimon Bailey, who takes the national lead on child protection, says forces must focus on those who pose a physical threat instead. \nThe NSPCC warned last year that up to half a million men may be viewing child sexual abuse images in the UK. \nAnd in the past five years, the number of offences recorded by police of viewing child sexual abuse images has more than doubled. Norfolk Constabulary's Chief Constable Simon Bailey (Photo: Twitter) \nMr Bailey, who is also chief constable of Norfolk Police, said police forces are currently at \"saturation point\" due to a rise in reports of sexual abuse, recent and historic, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. \nPolice receive an average of 112 complaints a day and there are more than 70,000 investigations a year. \nMr Bailey told The Times: \"How can the police service be expected to cope with all that, if, in the margins, we are still having to deal with what I would describe as very, very low risk offenders, who, based upon good risk assessments, pose little if any actual threat of contact abuse? \n\"...Those individuals that you can say with a degree of certainty genuinely don’t pose a physical threat - that to me seems to be a reasonable line [for an alternative approach to criminal action]. \n\"That individual who is not in contact with children and doesn’t pose a threat to children and is looking at low-level images... when you look at everything else that’s going on, and the threat that's posed of contact abuse to children, we have to look at doing something different with those individuals. \n\"Do the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts and the police have the capacity to put them into the justice system?\" \nCharities and campaigners have said before that more needs to be done to rehabilitate and prevent child sex abuse offending. \nThe NSPCC has called for UK internet firms to sign up to a set of minimum standards and an independent regulator to crack down on abuse images.
