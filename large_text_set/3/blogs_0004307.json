The other would require officers to provide their name, rank and precinct to people they stop.\nThe proposed measures put the mayor in a delicate spot because they pit the progressive wing of the council against the NYPD, with whom the mayor has had a bumpy relationship.\n“He doesn’t want a war with the cops and he doesn’t want a war with the police-reform advocates,” one council member said.\nAnother City Hall source characterized the mayor’s recent message to the two council members as: “Please don’t do this to me. You’re putting me in a bad spot.”\nRitchie Torres Brigitte Stelzer De Blasio has weathered regular attacks from the police union over his relationship with cops, but has calmed the waters by providing significant financial support to the NYPD.\nHe also came to a new contract agreement with the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, the largest police union, in January.\nBut that peace also opens him up to attacks from the left, which has been more vocal in recent months over the pace of police reform.\nAntonio Reynoso Dennis A. Clark Last summer, de Blasio, Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and then-NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton hammered out an agreement to implement administrative changes that resemble the legislative proposals.\nBut reform advocates say they doesn’t go far enough.\nThe bills’ sponsors, Council Members Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx) and Antonio Reynoso (D-Brooklyn), have been working for months to bring the measures to the floor.\nThey’ve even raised the prospect of using a motion to discharge — a rarely used procedural move that would override Mark-Viverito and force the proposals to a vote.\n“We’re intent on enacting the Right to Know,” Torres told The Post. “We’ve been crystal clear from the beginning that we refuse to take [a motion to] discharge off the table.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T09:50:05.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
