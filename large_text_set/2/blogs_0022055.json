(WJZ) –A Carroll County high school is causing controversy after administrators asked teachers to take down posters displayed in their classrooms. \nThe issue over the posters comes at a time when some students tell WJZ’s Rick Ritter they don’t feel accepted inside the school, and removing the posters only raises more questions. \nRELATED: CAIR Asking For ‘Pro-Diversity’ Posters To Be Displayed \nYou can feel it in the halls of Westminster High School. \n“I can feel the tension between the different people and their different views,” said Westminster High School senior Hamial Waince. \nMany students are searching for clear answers. \n“It’s like, ‘What’s going on? Why is this happening?,'” said Westminster HS senior Rubie Avery. \nThis is happening after posters were put up inside classrooms, but then ordered to be taken down. \nThe “We the People” posters depicted Latina, Muslim and African-American women in the same red, white and blue style of the “Hope” election posters for Barack Obama.

But some complained, saying they were perceived as anti-Trump. \n“After some reflection and some discussion, the posters came down until we can further examine the issue,” said Stephen Guthrie, superintendent of Carroll County Public Schools. “We don’t really have any guidelines in Carroll County in terms of what can be displayed, other than the classroom can’t be a forum for politics.” \nStudents tell WJZ being political was not the intent. \n“That wasn’t the intent at all, to be political or partisan in any way,” said junior Madi Macera. \n“There’s nothing partisan about it,” said Westminster junior Ryan Novotny. “It’s not being anti-Trump. Some students are very upset about this and I believe they have every right to be.” \nThe decision to take the posters down left many outraged and some students of color questioning the type of message that sends, with some saying that with the current climate nationwide, the posters are needed now more than ever. \n“It was very empowering to me as a colored woman, in a county that is 93 percent white people,” said Avery. \n“I want to see more diversity in the schools and not have students feel they’re not welcomed,” said Hamial. \n“[Reporter: Is it more important now more than ever for Carroll County schools to promote diversity?] “Yes, it is, and we’re absolutely going to do that and are committed to doing that,” said superintendent Guthrie. “We are going to take this opportunity to talk about diversity and more diversify our work force.” \nThe start of what students hope is a movement to make sure everyone feels accepted. \n“This county has so much more to offer, maybe then what a lot of people have in mind for our county,” said Macera. \nSome students are putting the images on these posters on t-shirts and plan to wear them to school next week. \nOfficials say a school board meeting has been scheduled to discuss the posters. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook Rick Ritter Rick Ritter joined WJZ Eyewitness News in May 2014 as a reporter.
