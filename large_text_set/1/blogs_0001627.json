Man City's disciplinary record is woeful \nWhen Fernandinho was sent off for a reckless two-footed challenge on Joey Gudmundsson, it took City's red card tally to seven for the season. Fernandinho himself has clocked up three reds in six weeks and will now serve a four-match ban, with discipline clearly now a major issue under Pep Guardiola. Six of the seven dismissals have been straight reds and Guardiola needs to address the issue before it derails City's season.

Aguro made up for his omission with an outrageous finish from a tight angle, a timely goal with Brazilian wonderkid Gabriel Jesus arriving today to challenge for his place. David Silva came off the bench (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Bravo continues to look a liability \nCity were in command and leading 2-0 when, in the 69 minute, Claudio Bravo came off his line to deal with a corner and missed the ball completely, with Burnley's Ben Mee – a City youth team graduate – scoring off the underside of the bar in the ensuing goalmouth melee. But the goal was further evidence of Bravo's weakness at dealing with high balls into the box, particularly when there are bodies involved. Claudio Bravo still looks shaky (Photo: Reuters) Heaton grows in stature \nIn contrast to Bravo, Tom Heaton showed his enduring class. He may have conceded twice in quick succession as Burnley ultimately succumbed to 10-man City, but before then Heaton had provided further proof of his growth in stature, making crucial saves from Kelechi Iheanacho, Raheem Sterling and Yaya Toure. The England keeper is seen as the natural successor to current No.1 Joe Hart and, on the evidence of this display, it's easy to concur with that, But Tom Heaton keeps impressing (Photo: PA) Ref Lee Mason has another tough day \nReferee Lee Mason got it wrong at Old Trafford on New Year's Eve, denying Zlatan Ibrahimovic a perfectly legitimate goal in a 2-1 over Middlesbrough for perceived dangerous play. United boss Jose Mourinho also complained Mason denied his side at least two clear-cut penalties. For the second time in three days in Manchester, Mason had a tough game to ref, showing Fernandinho a straight red and having to deal with a succession of robust challenges from both sides. City fans booed him and claimed he wasn't fit to referee, but the Bolton official did a decent job under the circumstances. poll loading Will Manchester City catch Chelsea this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T19:25:15.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
