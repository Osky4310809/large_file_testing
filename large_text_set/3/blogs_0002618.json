The Outlander also now comes equipped with interior floor illumination lamps to better welcome occupants into the cabin. \nThese are added on to the existing set of comprehensive features, which include keyless entry with engine push-start button, leather seats (with heated front seats), dual-zone auto air-conditioning, cruise control, automatic headlamps and wipers and a two-DIN touchscreen head unit as standard. \nThe Outlander is also equipped with a sunroof, electric tailgate with anti-pinch feature, leather upholstery and auto lights and wipers. No mechanical changes for the new model year update, and the 4WD offering continues on with a 2.4 litre four-cylinder MIVEC engine which delivers 167 PS at 6,000 rpm and 222 Nm of torque at 4,100 rpm. \nAvailable in three colours (Red Metallic, White Pearl and Grey Metallic), the CBU Outlander is priced at RM171,000, on-the-road without insurance, and comes with a five year/100,000 km warranty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T09:02:33.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
