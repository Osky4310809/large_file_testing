The Cupertino company has now issued a statement to TechCrunch confirming that the release of iOS 10.2.1 reduced unexpected shutdown issues on iPhone 6s by 80 percent. \nApple says that it made “improvements” to reduce the random shutdown issues on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 units. As per the data the company has received, the iOS 10.2.1 update led to a reduction in random shutdown by more than 80 percent on the iPhone 6s and over 70 percent on the iPhone 6. \nWith iOS 10.2.1, Apple made improvements to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns that a small number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we’ve received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we’re seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. \nWe also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It is important to note that these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare. \nAs per TechCrunch, Apple found sudden spikes in activity that drew the very maximum power from the battery. On older iPhone 6 and 6s units, the batteries were unable to deliver the power in an even manner which led to the devices randomly shutting down. While Apple has been able to reduce the shutdown issues to a great extent, the problem still persists. However, now it will be possible to restart the iPhone without having to plug it into a charger or computer. \nAdditionally, older iPhone 6 and 6s units with swollen batteries will start displaying a “your battery needs service” message inside the Battery info screen in the Settings app. This message will only show up on devices whose batteries Apple feels needs to be replaced. \nDid the iOS 10.2.1 update help in reducing random shutdown issues on your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s?
