Well as good as it could have been at least. Sure their 38-10 beatdown of the Chicago Bears was all for naught as their playoff hopes were dashed last weekend against the Green Bay Packers, but they still ended their season with a convincing and solid victory. \nMany players had a great performance on Sunday though surely none were as important or record-setting as the performance that tight end Kyle Rudolph put on. \nRudolph torched the Bears defense, catching 11 passes for 117 yards (both career-highs) and a touchdown - arguably his best performance of the season in what many considered to be a pointless game. \n\"I just knew it was important for us to come out here today and have a good showing. We wanted to end the year on a positive note,\" Rudolph said postgame, speaking on his performance Sunday. \"Most people say the game was meaningless but anytime you go out there and step on the field you're putting yourself on tape and the whole world is watching. As soon as you get in between those lines there are no meaningless games.\" \nSuch a mentality makes sense for a player of Rudolph's caliber and also makes clear why the sixth-year pro had a record-breaking season and a career year. \nThe 11 catches that Rudolph hauled in gave him 83 on the season, a new single-season Vikings' record for catches by a tight end. The previous record was 79 catches, set by Joe Senser back in 1981. \n\"I knew it was something that was within reach,\" Rudolph said, speaking about setting the team's single-season tight end receptions record. \"Like I said, you never really know how a game is going to go but we got rolling on offense early and it was important for us to come out and play well today. Me catching the ball just happened to be a part of that to win the game.\" \nThat wasn't the only spot in the record books Rudolph would claim by the end of the day. \nHis 22-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter was his seventh touchdown of the season, tying him for the fourth-highest total by a tight end in a Vikings' season. Rudolph is no stranger to that list though as in 2012 when he had a career-high nine touchdown catches. \nLastly, to make the former second-round draft pick's day even more impressive, his 117 receiving yards bring Rudolph's season-total to 840 this season. The 840 is the third-highest total in team history, behind only Joe Senser's 1,004 yards in 1981 and Steve Jordan's 859 yards in 1986. \nIt was a spectacular close to an amazing season for Rudolph who quickly became on of Sam Bradford's favorite and most-trusted targets. After having such a season, it's no surprise that Rudolph is hungry to get back on the field and have an even better year next season. \n\"For me, a lot of things go into why this year was more productive than others,\" Rudolph said. \"This is the standard that I'm setting and something I'll have to work all offseason to top next year.\" Check out Vikings.com for more information and Minnesota Vikings coverage throughout the year!
