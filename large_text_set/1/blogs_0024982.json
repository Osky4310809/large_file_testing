Arsenal 2-1 Burnley \n\"I hope I can keep that statistic until the end of the season,\" he said. \"It'll be difficult but for me personally but I just go from game to game and try to give the maximum and improve, then the results come. \n\"When I lose I sometimes just don't come home and stay at the hotel, because I don't want to listen to all that. But I'm happier for the other people than me that I haven't lost yet. \n\"When I go into a game I'm not thinking about losing, I'm there because I want to win. If I do something I do it properly, I'm a footballer because I want to improve and win games, that's why I'm sometimes difficult when I lose.\" Alex Iwobi celebrates with Mustafi after the German scored against Burnley \nArsenal find themselves in second place in the Premier League table heading into their clash with Watford on Tuesday night, but eight points behind leaders Chelsea. \nDespite that and the battle to finish in the top four this season, Mustafi insists Arsenal are only focused on their own game rather than the results of others.
