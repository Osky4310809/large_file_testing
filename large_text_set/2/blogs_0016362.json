Bandai Makes Star Wars and Marvel so Much Cooler with Samurai Marvel and Netflix have been pretty successful with their collaborations so far. Daredevil , Jessica Jones , and Luke Cage were all pretty great, even with their flaws. John Bernthal was a solid Punisher in the second season of Daredevil , and now he’s getting his own Netflix show. And soon you’ll be able to get an action figure of him, along with the MCU’s Daredevil , Elektra , and Jessica Jones.\nHasbro revealed a ton of new Marvel Legends action figures at its Toy Fair briefing on Saturday, and four that stood out are based on the Netflix shows. The company showed off four new six-inch Marvel Legends figures featuring the visages of Charlie Cox, Elodie Yung, Krysten Ritter, and Jon Bernthal as Daredevil, Elektra, Jessica Jones, and the Punisher. Sadly, there was no word on a Luke Cage figure with Mike Colter’s face. And I have a feeling I won’t be getting the Foggy Nelson action figure I suddenly want really badly for a while.\n\nMarvel fans will be happy to see a lot of weird deep cuts in the Marvel Legends line outside of the Netflix figures. Adam Warlock, Dazzler, Death’s Head, and Warlock (Technarchy, not Adam) are all getting 6-inch Legends figures, and Jessica Jones’ failed Jewel superhero persona from the comics will be getting its own three 3/4-inch version.\n\nA lot of familiar faces are coming back as action figures for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , but several are getting new head sculpts, like a fresh Chris Pratt face for Star-Lord . More importantly, Kurt Russell’s Ego is coming out as a new action figure, but it’s an Ego in a human form with a dad beard and a big scarf. I was hoping for a retooled Unicron with Kurt Russell’s head, personally. Ego will only be available in a two-pack with an unmasked Star-Lord. Doctor Strange is also getting into a new two-pack with… Doctor Strange. The Sorcerer Supreme with Benedict Cumberbatch’s face will be sold alongside a pale, translucent astral projection version of the same figure.\n\nHasbro unveiled the new 12-inch Marvel Legends line last year with Captain America , Iron Man , and Spider-Man . This year Deadpool is joining the detailed foot-tall crew with his own 12-inch Marvel Legend, complete with propeller-headed Zombie Deadpool head, alternate half-masked Wade face, and burrito. Thor and Hulk will also be getting 12-inch Marvel Legends versions (though Hulk is closer to 14.5 inches).\nMost new Marvel Legends figures will hit stores this Fall.\nView as: One Page Slides 1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10. \n11. \n12. \n13. \n14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:49:35.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
