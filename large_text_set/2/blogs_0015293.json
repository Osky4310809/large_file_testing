Dolphins gave Cameron Wake a 2-year, $19 million extension that includes $11 million guaranteed, per source. \n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 18, 2017 \nThe 35-year-old Wake, who also signed a two-year extension last May, now is signed through 2018. The Dolphins were 9-2 after Wake joined the starting lineup, and he became just the third player to register 10 or more sacks at the age of 34 or older. Wake has 81.5 sacks in eight seasons, the second most in Dolphins history behind Hall of Famer Jason Taylor’s 131. \n— Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) February 18, 2017 \nEarlier this week, the Dolphins released defensive linemen Mario Williams and Earl Mitchell, and were poised to release offensive lineman Branden Albert until they were approached about a possible trade. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:19:50.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
