But, as ever in Emmerdale, not everything was as it seemed and more than one twist played out as Emma got back in control of the situation. \nWhen Faith arrived at the hospital to have things out with Emma, the murderer thought that her game was up and tearfully told Faith how remorseful she felt about James, little knowing that Faith was actually just referring to the fact that she nearly clobbered her over the head with a rock.\n(Picture: ITV) Under the impression that Faith knew enough to have Emma locked up for murder, the hospitalised psychopath agreed to pay her blackmailer 10 grand in exchange for her silence.\nWhen Faith later sat down and chatted to Moira in the waiting room, the full story came to light – Faith hadn’t overheard the entire confession at the church but had taken umbrage at Emma referring to her as ‘the devil’.\n(Picture: ITV) As Moira explained to Faith that Emma felt guilty for James’ ‘suicide’ as she apparently hadn’t loved him enough, Faith appeared to relent and walked back in to speak with Emma, who confirmed that she was willing to buy Faith’s silence so long as it were a one off.\n\nBut as Faith rummaged in her handbag, a bottle of pills fell out, which Faith promptly hid. The ball was back in Emma’s court as she warned Faith that she would tell her family about her addiction and they reached a stalemate, with both eventually agreeing to keep their silence.\n(Picture: ITV) As Faith warned Emma that she would kill her if she tried to pull anymore stunts – or revealed anything to her family – it started to dawn on Emma that Faith didn’t actually know a thing about what happened to James and relief swept over her.\nBut with both women hiding secrets, there is a rocky road ahead.\n(Picture: ITV) How much longer can Emma – who already proved how close to the edge she was getting – keep her conscience from bursting free and exposing her crime? And just what is Faith hiding?\nMORE: 12 reasons why the amazing Faith Dingle is the new queen of Emmerdale \nMORE: Emmerdale tragedy, crime and heartbreak: 10 big spoilers revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:26:08.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
