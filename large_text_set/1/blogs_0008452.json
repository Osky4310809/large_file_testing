The arrest occurred only a few hours after the Steelers dismantled the Miami Dolphins, 30-12, in an AFC Wild Card round game at Heinz Field.\nThe complaint details the incident between Porter and a doorman, Jon Neskow, at The Flats, a Pittsburgh bar, and later an off-duty officer, Paul Abel, that arrived on the scene. \nOfficer Abel wrote that he, with help from the unidentified men, grabbed Mr. Porter by the jacket to pull him off of the doorman.\n“Porter let go of Neskow dropping him back down to the ground. Porter came to rest against a car parked directly in front of the establishment,” according to the complaint.\nOfficer Abel wrote that Porter, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs about 260 pounds, grabbed him by the wrists and smelled of alcohol. Officer Abel wrote that he is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 145 pounds.\nPorter was denied entrance to the bar because “Last time you (Porter) were here, you threatened to kill me. You need to leave. You are not getting in,” according to the doorman in the complaint.\nNo one involved in the incident reported injuries and Porter was released on $25,000 bail.\nThe Steelers had no comment.\n( Pittsburgh Post-Gazette )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:32:50.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
