No....I’m still looking young, right? I want to play in Europe, especially in England. I want to continue doing that for a few years yet. \n“It’s my idea to stay in England, I always say that if I went to China I would end up feeling angry there. Do you play football because you love football - or do you play because you want to make money? What’s the purpose?

I enjoy helping my team-mates, I enjoy playing against the big players and teams. \n“I want to carry on in that way. Some people have the mentality that they want to do that - to try something different. But for me, my feeling is that I want to play more football.” \nToure has become one of the biggest stars in the Premier League after moving to City from Barcelona seven years ago. \nHe has forced his way back into City’s line-up despite being frozen out at first by Pep Guardiola after demanding an apology for the behaviour of his agent.
