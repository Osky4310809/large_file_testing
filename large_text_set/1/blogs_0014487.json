Many of the findings involved black and Hispanic victims. \nFULL REPORT: Read the Justice Department's Report on the Chicago Police Department \nHouser, 57, shot Nieves in the 2500 block of North Lowell Avenue in Hermosa about 9:15 a.m. Jan. 2, according to authorities. Police said the officer's weapon was the only gun found on the scene. Nieves, 38, was shot multiple times. \nPolice Supt. Eddie Johnson earlier this month that the two knew each other from \"a confrontation\" that occurred \"a few weeks ago.\" The officer was in Hermosa visiting someone, police said, and had clashed with Nieves on multiple occasions. \n\"I have a lot more questions than I do answers at this time,\" Johnson said. \nChicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi​ earlier this month said Johnson relieved Houser of his police powers. \n\"The Chicago Police Department turned the case over to the State's Attorney and the Independent Police Review Authority once the possibility of criminal violations were suspected,\" Guglielmi​ said Wednesday. \"CPD will fully cooperate with the State's Attorney throughout the judicial process.\" \nRELATED: Weeks After Run-in With Off-Duty Officer, Man Killed By Him \nAccording to NBC, Nieves worked in construction and bar security, and lived on the Northwest Side. \n\"My brother Cheo ... was the type of person everybody wanted to hang around great personality, happy, sweet, awesome sense of humor, thoughtful, and always smiling and would give you a monster hug that would leave you gasping for air,\" sister Angelica Figueroa wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family . \"Cheo would even be your night in shining armor if you you needed him. He was so close to all his family and friends and had many that loved him. Cheo also had two fur babies that meant the world to him. This was a man that was always willing to help where he can if he could.\" \nIn an interview with CBS2 , Nieves' sister said she understands if an officer uses force when his life is in danger — but that was not the case here. \n“If you are an officer, and you are getting shot at, and your life is in danger, I understand,\" she said. \"But if a person doesn’t have a weapon, it doesn’t give you the right to take out your weapon and shoot at that person. It does not.” \nNieves' family sued Houser and the City of Chicago in federal court just days after the shooting. The Tribune reports that Houser has faced at least 20 disciplinary investigations since the early 1990s and has been suspended several times. \nMost recently, on Oct. 29, 2014, Houser was accused of detaining, grabbing and pushing someone to the ground while waiting for the Red Line train at 95th Street, according to the Invisible Institute database . The final outcome of that complaint is unknown. \nAndrew M. Stroth, attorney for the Nieves family, reacted to the charges Wednesday. \n\"The Nieves family is devastated by the loss of Jose. The State's Attorney's action today will not bring back Jose but is an important and swift step in the criminal justice process.\" \nHouser is due in court for a bond hearing at noon Thursday. \nHouser's murder charges come in the wake of the first-degree murder charges filed against Officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot dead 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in a case that rocked the city and led to the year-long Justice Department probe, the results of which were just released Friday. That case was thought to be the first time in at least 35 years that an on-duty officer had been charged with first-degree murder. \nHere's the federal civil lawsuit filed against Houser and the City of Chicago: \nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T06:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:23:20.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
