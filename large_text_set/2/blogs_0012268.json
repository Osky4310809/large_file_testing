While his picks weren't the most accurate , it was still somewhat fun to see how his picks stacked up against ordinary Americans. \nThis year, however, the presidential bracket challenge is no more. ESPN had reached out to President Donald Trump to see if he'd like to continue this new tradition and fill out a bracket come March--but Trump \"respectfully declined.\" ESPN's comment: We expressed our interest to the White House in continuing the presidential bracket. They have respectfully declined. https://t.co/U2cKGLfkXh â€” Mike Soltys (@espnmikes) February 15, 2017 \nKind of sad, but understandable as Trump has never really been known to be a big NCAA basketball fan.
