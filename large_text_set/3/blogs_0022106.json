You answer it anyway and hear, “Can you hear me now?” It’s a pre-recorded robocall – even though it sounds like a real person – and it’s illegal. We’ve heard from hundreds of people who have gotten calls like this. \nHere’s what to do if you get a call from someone you don’t recognize asking, “Can you hear me?”: Don’t respond, just hang up . If you get a call, don't press 1 to speak to a live operator or any other number to be removed from the list. If you respond in any way, it will probably just lead to more robocalls – and they’re likely to be scams. Contact your phone provider . Ask your phone provider what services they provide to block unwanted calls . Put your phone number on the Do Not Call registry. Access the registry online or by calling 1-888-382-1222. Callers who don’t respect the Do Not Call rules are more likely to be crooks. File a complaint with the FTC. Report the experience online or call 1-877-382-4357.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T03:50:56.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
