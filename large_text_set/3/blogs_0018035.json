However, it adds that the most appropriate time would be Ms Sturgeon’s preference of between autumn next year and March 2019. Auto update 1:11PM How economically risky would Scottish independence be? \nT he SNP was widely believed to have lost the economic argument during their first stab at independence in 2014, and it is difficult to see how they could win a re-run this argument in the current climate. \nFalls in the price of oil have taken a hefty toll on Scotland's economy since 2014 and, coupled with the country's huge deficit and sluggish rate of growth, independence is an even riskier prospect now than it was two and a half years ago. Chart - oil prices have halved since 2014 Scotland's oil revenue is running dry \nB ack in 2014, the SNP made a big noise about just how well an independent Scotland could perform on the world stage. Central to this thesis was the amount of money the country could make from North Sea oil. \nEstimates as to just how much revenue could be produced from North Sea oil varied significantly depending on who you asked - but the price of oil itself seemed to be relatively stable at between $90 and $110 per barrel. \nIn September 2014 - the month of the referendum - crude oil prices were ticking along at $91 per barrel. It is expensive to produce oil in the UK Scotland's deficit is larger than that of Greece \nN icola Sturgeon's pitch for independence looks set to centre on a desire for Scotland to remain in the European Union and the single market. \nHowever, the terms by which an independent Scotland could enter the EU are extremely uncertain . Countries face a lengthy application process in order to become members and Scotland may well be forced to adopt the euro as the price of membership. \nOne of the target metrics the EU enforces on its members is for each state to aim for a budget deficit of no more than 3pc of GDP. In quotes | A second referendum on Scottish independence \nS cotland is a terrible performer in this regard, spending £1,200 a head more than the rest of the UK and receiving £400 per head less. \nThe Scottish government's latest annual estimate puts the country's deficit at £15bn or 9.5pc of GDP. This would be comfortably the worst score for any EU member state. \nScotland may have to prove it can reduce this deficit before EU membership becomes a possibility and this would take time. Scotland has a huge deficit, relative to GDP Could Scotland go it alone? \nW hile it could be argued that, with greater fiscal autonomy, Scotland might be able to reduce its deficit were it to become independent, its general economic performance is less that impressive. \nIn the first quarter of 2015 Scotland outperformed the rest of the UK, achieving 0.75pc quarterly growth. Since then, growth has been slow with the UK as a whole outperforming Scotland in every quarter. \nScotland's economy only narrowly avoided contracting in the first quarter of 2016 with growth of 0.01pc based on the previous quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:20:56.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
