Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAs Twitchy reported, President Trump kicked off his press conference Thursday with a direct strike at the reporters sitting right in front of him, declaring that “the press is out of control” and escalating from there. \nNot surprisingly, the news media did not appreciate that introduction. Fox News’ Shepard Smith was “near-apoplectic” on air that afternoon, and journalists like Ron Fournier declared that they are #NotTheEnemy after Trump followed up with this Twitter broadside, which racked up more than 125,000 likes in the space of 24 hours. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nIn fact, there was enough of a backlash on social media to spawn a Twitter Moment: Members of the media explain why they are #NotTheEnemy . https://t.co/m5ltt8AZff \n— Twitter Moments (@TwitterMoments) February 18, 2017 \nAnthony De Rosa, digital production manager for The Daily Show, is no Trump fan, but he’s offered some of the best advice we’ve seen. The best response is a well functioning, aggressive press that ignores a debate about themselves. \n— Anthony De Rosa (@Anthony) February 18, 2017 Trending Some good advice the media will never follow: report the news, ignore a debate about yourselves \nAnd the chance of that is … ? @Anthony is there really that much coverage of trump's enemy tweet? I haven't seen much/but maybe I missed it. CNN didn't even write a story \n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 18, 2017 @brianstelter I'm not just referring to his tweet, but his continuing effort to move the focus off himself and on the press \n— Anthony De Rosa (@Anthony) February 18, 2017 @brianstelter the press has engaged him on that debate, hopefully less as we go on \n— Anthony De Rosa (@Anthony) February 18, 2017 @Anthony sorta… I just think there's a lot less real news coverage of this issue than twitter chatter implies \n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 18, 2017 \nHas there really been that much coverage of Trump’s tweet? CNN’s Brian Stelter, host of Reliable Sources, hasn’t seen much, but never fear, news outlets are on it … including CNN. Trump’s Twitter targets, including CNN, were a hot topic on “The Situation Room” Friday.
