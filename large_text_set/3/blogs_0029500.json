He’ll get the ball down and play tiki-taka, but he won’t mind playing direct as well. \nI’m very dismissive of managers who have philosophies and stick to them even when they don’t have the players who suit it. \nKoeman looks at his players and tries to get the best out of them individually, then work them into a team, and I like that a lot. \nWhat he needs now is to kick on, and that would mean competing for trophies and out-thinking the likes of Jurgen Klopp and Jose Mourinho on a consistent basis. \nIf he can do that, then I can’t think of a better manager to guide Everton through a tricky time and close the gap that exists across the Mersey divide. poll loading What's your Mersey derby prediction? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:13:05.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
