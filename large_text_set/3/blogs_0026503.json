Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nAbout once a month or so, I like to make a quiche. Sometimes I'll bake my own pie crust , but other times, when I'm in a hurry, I'll use a premade one from the store. The thing I love about quiche is its timelessness. \nIt can be enjoyed at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I've even eaten a cold slice as a snack in the afternoon! It's also a great way to use up old and leftover ingredients. \nThis Mediterranean-inspired quiche is my latest favorite recipe. It's a perfect easy meatless meal, and it's so good you may end up eating half of one quiche in a sitting! \nThe filling is a combination of saut√©ed onions, zucchini, red peppers, and sun-dried tomatoes; gruyere and goat cheese provide a luxurious richness. Mediterranean Quiche Adapted from Emeril Lagasse Notes \nUsing clarified butter will help the onion caramelize quicker, but feel free to use standard butter if you do not have any clarified butter available. \nThe quiche pictured has whole wheat pie crust, but that's entirely optional. Regular pie crust will work too. Ingredients", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:43:42.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
