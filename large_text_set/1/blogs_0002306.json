Ada & Akin’s Picture Perfect Pre-Wedding Shoot by AWGZ Photography 25.11.2016 at By BellaNaija Weddings 42 Comments Ada and Akin met in church. Soon after, Akin convinced her to become an usher, and not only did their bond grow, but also their joint commitment to growing together as Christians. From being a shoulder to lean on, Akin became a steady presence in her life, and sooner than later, she had to admit she really liked him too…A proposal in dreamy Dubai made things official and now they are bride and groom. Enjoy their love story and pre-wedding photos by AWGZ Photography ! Our Love Story by the bride, Ada Akin and I met in church. I wanted to share a testimony on a particular day, so I was directed to him because he was the HOD of ushering department. Prior to that time I was just a normal church attendee. I spoke to him about my testimony and he directed me how to go about it, I guess I caught his attention. Weeks later we saw again and he got on my neck to join the ushering department and after much persuasion I did join, became a worker in church and then we started talking a bit more. I wasn’t really interested at first but his love for God was so passionate and that was attractive. He inspired me to be a better person, he made my relationship with Christ deeper. He was always available if I needed anyone to talk to; if I had bad dreams he was the first person I would talk to and he would pray with me and encourage me, it was a different kind of friendship even though I was too stubborn to admit I liked him.So one day he called and said “Ada, when was the last time you were really happy?” and I said, “the last time I traveled haha” and he was like would u follow me for a trip? What was amazing was that my happiness meant so much to him, after that day I let my guards down. Weeks later we started dating, he was everything and more, he would always put me first in everything and made me top priority. A year and a half down the line we traveled to Dubai and I had no clue he was going to propose, he made interesting plans on the trip and for us to stay at Burj Al Arab the last day we were there, didn’t think it was anything because he had always talked about going there. And during a romantic dinner he popped the question, “Will you marry me?” and said he couldn’t think of a better place to propose and show me how much he appreciates me than the only 7-star hotel in the world. I would say I have one of the best men in the world, you can never go wrong with a man that loves Christ.
