Until we return to the day-to-day of prison life, let’s take an early look at a few things you’ll be able to do behind bars…\n\nDust off the old instruments and get the band together for the departing gig as you play alongside your fellow inmates, providing some much needed relief to the sound of sweet music. Oh yeah, feels good, right? But! Please don’t forget you are meant to be escaping after all, right? … right? \nPrison life has never been so good, or should I say “fashionable?” Once you’ve established your mob of inmate pals, go nuts with the criminal amounts of accessories and styles to get across your versions of what “Prison Chic” really is all about. Crazy hairstyles, glasses, facial hair, hats… With such adornments available at your guilty fingertips, would you ever want to leave your cell without looking like a million (stolen) bucks?\n\nBecome the ultimate incarcerated deviant as you foil and plot your opponents’ downfalls one by one. “But how,” you ask? That’s up to you! If you are asking for advice, I would recommend such activities as flooding a rivals’ toilet. It’s just an example, though. An example where you accidentally lure in curious prison guards, who happen to stumble across a certain prison cell littered with escape attempt debris!\nGenerate the ultimate plan of escape alongside your freedom-hungry online friends! Be sure to establish who takes up what role in the crafty plot — who exactly is tasked with keeping an eye out for danger? Who’ll be in charge of providing the muscle if the plan goes west? And of course, who will be the brains behind the operation ensuring all required materials and tools are at hand for the mischievous act?\n\n…Oh, and one more thing; you’ll be able to learn how to speak “dolphin.” See you on the inside, chum!\n//", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T16:49:27.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
