Elizabeth Palmer reports f... \nSpeaking at the Russian parliament on Wednesday, Sergey Lavrov said Russia has “no illusions that there will be a new reset with the U.S., we don’t have any naive expectations.” \n“We know that Trump is considered a master of the deal but Vladimir Putin knows how to make deals, too, in the interests of Russia,” Lavrov said. \n“Reset” was the term that President Obama’s administration and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev coined in 2009 to describe a drive for closer ties between the two countries. The initiative was, however, short-lived. \nEarlier on Wednesday, Lavrov said Moscow welcomes Mr. Trump’s assurances that he wants to improve relations with Russia . He expressed hope that unlike the Obama administration, Mr. Trump would refrain from “meddling into affairs of other countries.” © 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
