Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mastectomy patient waved goodbye to her old breasts and welcomed new ones by throwing a BOOB party. \nSally Chapman, 29, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, discovered she was a carrier of the lethal gene BRCA that increases the chance of developing a fatal cancer in 2012. \nAfter recognising her family's cursed history of cancer-related deaths, with 11 of her grandmother's siblings all dying due to the disease, she opted for a double mastectomy two-years-ago. \nShe held a ' Goodbye bad boobs ' party to bring up her spirit - eating boob shaped cake, playing pin the tassel on the breast and battling a boob-shaped pinata. \nThe secondary-school teacher had breast and nipple reconstruction and to complete the journey had coloured-ink tattooing on her nipples this month.

Sally after her breast reconstruction (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nSally said: \"I had my goodbye bad boobs party a couple of weeks before my surgery with friends and family. \n\"We had a boob cake, pin the tassels on the boobs and boob pinatas.\" \nAfter having both breasts and nipples removed she received saline injection into her expanders every three months, to stretch the skin ready for an implant. \nShe had implants placed inside and later opted to have nipples constructed from the fat beneath the scar tissue in her breasts \nSally said: \"I didn't know what to expect, I was more on edge for that then any of the other surgeries, but I was surprised how lifelike my breasts looked. \n\"After having the implants in I couldn't believe how real and how human they felt - it's made such a difference.\" Read More Single mum got flower tattoo to cover cancer surgery scars â€“ and fell in love with the artist Sally's party even featured a boob cake (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nEarlier this month she finished her journey after having specialist ink tattooing to the nipples and is now looking forward to a healthy future. \nSally who started a blog to document her journey, is now applying for charity status to help other BRCA patients and encourage everyone to get tested for BRCA. \nShe said: \"I think everyone should have the option to be tested and there needs to be more awareness about it. \n\"I've been holding events since November to educate people about BRCA and to spread awareness.\" \nFor more info visit: www.pinkpantstrust.co.uk Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T06:31:30.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
