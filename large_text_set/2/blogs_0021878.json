There’s no denying that the incident comes at a contentious time in America where there’s a raging debate about immigration and job loss.\nIn some quarters the killing has melded with the issue of a new Donald Trump administration getting tough on immigration and blaming migrants for supposed job losses. However, the forces behind what happened in Kansas predate Trump. Indians were blamed for “stealing” jobs from Americans during the Obama administration as well.\nRecall that it was former President Barack Obama who had coined the “Say No to Bangalore and Yes to Buffalo” slogan to rescind tax incentives to US companies that had branches overseas.\nMoreover, it was during his administration that an Indian consul was arrested on trumped up charges, having to do with the trope of Indians being willing to work for less than Americans. Similarly, racism is a longterm problem in America. As is a prolific gun culture that results in horrific shootings across the US, including in schools and colleges.\nHere, it’s noteworthy that neither Republican nor Democratic administrations have had the courage to repeal America’s absurd gun laws.\nOn the positive side many Americans are aware of their absurdity as well as of the damage protectionism will inflict on the US economy, and American institutions are strong. These are issues for the US political process to work through. The Trump administration should, however, issue sharp condemnations of hate crimes howsoever they may be inclined on other issues. Else they will be hard to control and tomorrow Jews as well as blacks, important constituencies that President Donald Trump would want to court, will be affected. Trump should make it clear that such hate is not acceptable in his America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:59:31.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
