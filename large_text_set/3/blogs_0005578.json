The art, which depicts Bob Odenkirk as “Jimmy McGill,” plays off of Jimmy’s propensity for putting himself in situations which could ultimately lead to his incarceration. \nSeason 3 follows the twists and turns of Jimmy McGill’s devolution toward Breaking Bad’s Saul Goodman — Albuquerque’s most notorious criminal lawyer. Six years before he meets Walter White, Jimmy is a more-or-less law-abiding, small-time attorney hustling to champion his underdog clients, build his practice, and somehow make a name for himself. \nThe acclaimed second season ended with a pair of cliffhangers. Determined to prevent his brother from practicing law, Chuck staged an elaborate con, secretly recording Jimmy’s confession to a felony. When Mike set his sights on sociopathic cartel boss Hector Salamanca, an ominous intervention stopped him from pulling the trigger, raising questions as to what other dangerous players may be in the game. \nAs the new season begins, the repercussions of Chuck’s scheme test Jimmy and Kim’s fledgling law practices — and their romance — as never before. This imminent existential threat presses Jimmy’s faltering moral compass to the limit. Meanwhile, Mike searches for a mysterious adversary who seems to know almost everything about his business. \nAs the season progresses, new characters are introduced and backstories are further illuminated with meaningful nods to the Breaking Bad universe. \nPeter Gould and Vince Gilligan helm Season 3, alongside fellow executive producers Mark Johnson, Melissa Bernstein, Thomas Schnauz, and Gennifer Hutchison. The second season of Better Call Saul , one of the highest-rated dramas on cable, garnered seven Emmy Award nominations and three Critics’ Choice Award nominations. The series has also been recognized with an AFI Award for TV Program of the Year, a Writers Guild Award, and numerous award nominations from the Writers Guild, Producers Guild, Golden Globes, and Television Critics Association. Co-created by Gilligan and Gould, the series stars Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy McGill, as well as Jonathan Banks, Michael McKean, Rhea Seehorn, Patrick Fabian, Michael Mando, and Giancarlo Esposito.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:21:26.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
