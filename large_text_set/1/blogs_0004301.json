She is also a masterful knitter, who has two suitcases full of original creations that she often displays on her window for passersby.\nOn Sept. 17, two officers knocked on Feast’s door.\n“As soon as I opened the door, the woman just said, ‘We have had a complaint about the black body hanging in your window,’” Feast  told the Daily Mirror .\n“I told them to look closer and they would see it was just a baby black gorilla,” Feast continued. \"She looked at it and said that it was.”\nFeast explained that the “black body” in question was just “Cilla the Gorilla,” a baby gorilla she knitted a year ago. She was shocked when the officer told her that someone in the neighborhood complained about the display, calling it “offensive.”\n\n“It’s absolutely ridiculous,” Feast said. “It is not racist at all. Gorillas are black - I couldn’t make a white one. It is just a knitted toy. It didn’t mean anything.”\nFeast and her husband, Philip, 71, were so shocked that they made a poster asking for whomever issued the complaint to come forward: “Are you the person/persons that made a complaint to police about the knitted toy? Well why don’t you knock on our door and tell us face to face what your concerns were about this toy? These toys usually bring a smile to most people’s faces - especially kiddies. I am so looking forward to seeing your face, but it is not going to happen is it ”\nInterestingly enough, a spokesman for the Cambridge police  told the Daily Mirror  that they did not receive a complaint about the knitted toy: “The police did not receive any calls from members of the public about this. Two PCSOs saw an object hanging from a window, which they thought may be seen as a potentially racially offensive object … After establishing that the object was in fact a hand-made knitted gorilla and nothing offensive, the officers left and carried on their patrols.”\nSource:  The Daily Mirror  / Photo Credit:  Wiki Media ,  SWNS /The Daily Mirror\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T08:44:52.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
