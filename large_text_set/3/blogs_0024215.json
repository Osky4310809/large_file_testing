According to the Angus Reid Institute poll of 1,511 Canadians, 31 per cent say the motion “should not be passed” because it’s a threat to freedom of speech, another 31 per cent say it’s work passing even for symbolic reasons “but it won’t have any real impact,” and 26 per cent say, “not worth passing because it won’t do anything and so it’s a waste of time. Only 12 per cent said they felt the motion is “worth passing” and “will help reduce anti-Muslim attitudes and discrimination.”\nDavid Akin/National Post A group protests against M-103 on Parliament Hill on Tuesday, March 21, 2017. “Canadians are asking the question, ‘Is this the best way to be fighting Islamophobia?’” said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute.\nAnd, if it were up to the citizenry, M-103 would likely fail.\n\nA plurality, 42 per cent, said they would vote against the motion, compared to 29 per cent who would vote for it and 29 per cent who don’t know or would choose to abstain. Even accounting for the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 per cent 19 times out of 20, the results point to country that’s more opposed to the motion than in its favour.\nThat’s a stark contrast to the make-up of the House of Commons, where both the Liberal and NDP caucuses are expected to support the motion Thursday. Their respective caucuses, 180 and 44 MPs, comprise two thirds — or 66 per cent of parliament — compared to the 90 Conservative MPs, many of whom oppose the motion and make up just under a third, or about 27 per cent of parliament.\nDespite the Liberals stringent support for the motion introduced by Ontario MP Iqra Khalid, their supporters aren’t as convinced it’s necessary: just 38 per cent of Liberal voters from the 2015 election support M-103, while 33 per cent oppose it and 28 per cent would abstain. The NDP support is stronger but not by much: 44 per cent of those who support the New Democrats would vote for it, while 33 per cent oppose and 23 per cent have no opinion. Opposition is strongest among Conservatives, 68 per cent of whom would vote against it, compared to 14 per cent who support and 18 per cent who would abstain.\nThe results show just how thorny the issue has become, Kurl said, adding “When you offer people the opportunity for an abstention on a particularly dicey topic you may find a part percentage will take it.”\nThe motion that has divided parliament has also shaken up the Conservative leadership race, where only one candidate of 14 — Michael Chong — said he will support it.\nIt is a shame the Liberals would rather play games than clarify their language and achieve a consensus\nThe phone survey shows the debate as to whether the largely symbolic motion will affect freedom of speech is permeating the public consciousness. As mentioned above, 31 per cent oppose M-103 because they worry it’s a threat to freedom of speech even though, practically, it would do no such thing. Others, most notably many Conservative members, have said the term “Islamophobia” is too vague and can be taken to mean either anti-Muslim sentiment or criticism of Islamism.\n“Canadians are opposed to this Liberal motion, not because they are bigots as some on the left have suggested, but because Canadians understand the problem with using language that is unclear and potentially open to political abuse,” said Conservative MP Garnett Genuis in a statement. He said MPs should “continue to uphold the dignity of every person regardless of religious affiliation” but “it is a shame the Liberals would rather play games than clarify their language and achieve a consensus on a motion to condemn prejudice.”\nRelated Ahead of M-103 debate, duelling mobs clash on Parliament Hill over Islamophobia M-103 protests: Violence breaks out as supporters, critics of motion condemning Islamophobia clash Rex Murphy: M-103 is a political billboard. Pick a side and advertise your virtues Intriguingly, however, Canadians do agree that anti-Muslim sentiment is a problem, especially in the wake of the deadly attack on a Quebec mosque last month: 66 per cent said the shooting was a sign “of deeper problems with anti-Muslim attitudes in Canadian society” compared to 34 per cent who said the shooting was “an isolated incident.”\nThe disconnect between believing anti-Muslim sentiment is a problem and the opposition to M-103 could be a result of Canadians wondering whether racism is something the government can or should address.\n“You also have Canadians split on the issue of mandate. Is it the government role to be condemning Islamophobia?” Kurl said.\nKhalid’s office did not respond to request for comment for this piece, nor did Conservative or NDP spokespeople.\nThe full motion reads as follows:\n“That, in the opinion of the House, the government should: (a) recognize the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear; (b) condemn Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination and take note of House of Commons’ petition e-411 and the issues raised by it; and (c) request that the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage undertake a study on how the government could (i) develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism and religious discrimination including Islamophobia, in Canada, while ensuring a community-centered focus with a holistic response through evidence-based policy-making, (ii) collect data to contextualize hate crime reports and to conduct needs assessments for impacted communities, and that the Committee should present its findings and recommendations to the House no later than 240 calendar days from the adoption of this motion, provided that in its report, the Committee should make recommendations that the government may use to better reflect the enshrined rights and freedoms in the Constitution Acts, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:02:46.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
