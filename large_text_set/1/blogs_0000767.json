Share: Latest News Recent News Emmanuel Sanders has been ruled out of Week 17 against the Raiders with a left foot injury. Jan 1 - 5:03 PM Emmanuel Sanders caught 1-of-3 targets for 26 yards in the Broncos' Week 16 loss to the Chiefs. Trevor Siemian wasn't pushing the ball downfield at all, as Devontae Booker saw a team-high 10 targets. Among the receivers, Demaryius Thomas saw eight looks. Simply put, Sanders wasn't able to win deep and Siemian wasn't able to get him the ball because of all the pressure. Sanders will be a WR2 next week against Oakland. He went 5-47-0 against the Raiders in Week 9. Mon, Dec 26, 2016 10:39:00 AM Emmanuel Sanders caught 3-of-6 targets for 48 yards in the Broncos' Week 15 loss to the Patriots. Seeing a lot of Malcolm Butler, Sanders was largely erased. Sanders wasn't targeted in the first quarter, and didn't catch his first pass until the fourth. For Week 16, Sanders gets a rematch with a Chiefs defense he scored for 7/162/1 last month. Sun, Dec 18, 2016 07:37:00 PM Emmanuel Sanders caught 11-of-14 targets for 100 yards and one touchdown in the Broncos' Week 14 loss to the Titans. He and Demaryius Thomas combined to see 30 targets on a day Trevor Siemian fired off 51 passes. With the Broncos' running game not working, Sanders, Thomas, and TE AJ Derby served as an extension of that nonexistent rushing attack. Sanders was able to secure a three-yard lofted pass for a short touchdown, the Broncos' only of the day. Sanders has seen at least nine targets in six straight games. He'll be a WR2 next week against the Patriots.
