Although the EFCC was not the applicant, the order was granted in its favour in the body of the order. \n“The power of this honourable court to make interim forfeiture order(s) pursuant to Sections 28 and 29 of the EFCC Act, 2004, is applicable only to alleged offences charged under the EFCC Act and not to offences cognisable under any other law,” Yakubu said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:12:15.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
