Their lands are the Iron Islands off the west coast of the continent. They rule from their castle Pyke from the island of the same name . The Iron Islands are harsh and bleak and the Greyjoys have traditionally survived by raiding their neighbors. They have always had plans to conquer the mainland. The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke . [1] \nHouse Greyjoy boasts descent from the Grey King , a legendary King of the Iron Islands said to have ruled for a thousand years and taken a mermaid as his wife. Like the vast majority of ironborn , they worship the Drowned God . [1] \nLord Balon Greyjoy was the founder of the Kingdom of the Iron Islands . He led a rebellion against King Robert Baratheon eight years before the events of the series begin. Balon's sons Rodrik and Maron were killed in the unsuccessful rebellion. Balon's only surviving son Theon was made a ward of Lord Eddard Stark to ensure Balon's submission to King Robert. [2] Only his daughter, Yara Greyjoy , and two of his brothers remained on the Iron Islands after his defeat. [3] \nAt some point, Balon exiles his younger brother Euron Greyjoy , who becomes a feared pirate that terrorises the seas between Oldtown and Qarth . [4] Edit \nTheon Greyjoy is a ward of Lord Eddard Stark . He lives at the Stark castle of Winterfell , where he has a cordial relationship with his Stark hosts. [5] Despite the respectful treatment accorded by the Starks, Theon is insecure about his status as a ward. He boasts of his status as a lord to Osha , a Wildling servant in the Stark household, but fails to intimidate her. [6] He later accompanies Ned's son Robb Stark , the King in the North , to fight in the War of the Five Kings and wins Robb's trust and favor. [7] Edit \nTheon appeals to King Robb to send him on a mission to negotiate an alliance with his father, King Balon, reasoning that the Starks would need ships to attack King's Landing . Despite Catelyn Stark 's distrust of Balon, Robb relents and sends Theon back to the Iron Islands to secure help. [8] However, King Balon has other ideas and plans to use the power struggle on the mainland to carve up a kingdom in the North. Theon is torn between his birth family and his loyalty to the Starks, but ultimately chooses to submit to Balon. Theon decides to renege his allegiance to the Starks and is baptised in the name of the Drowned God while his family watches. [9] \nBalon's daughter, Yara Greyjoy , leads a large force that attacks Deepwood Motte , the seat of House Glover . [9] Meanwhile, Theon is made the commander of the Sea Bitch . Instead of attacking small fishing villages as ordered, Theon and his men raid Torrhen's Square and succeed in drawing the remaining Stark forces away from Winterfell. [10] Without consulting Balon or Yara, Theon and his men seize Winterfell and capture Ned's younger sons Bran and Rickon Stark . Theon also executes Ser Rodrik Cassel for defying him. However, the two Stark boys and their Direwolves escape with the help of Osha and Hodor . [11] \nIn retaliation, Theon murders two orphans and claims them as Bran and Rickon. [12] His actions have the effect of fuelling northern hostility towards the Ironborn invaders. Balon and Yara are furious with Theon's conduct, which has jeopardized the Ironborn war effort. Yara leads a party to implore her brother to leave Winterfell. Theon refuses and insists on defending his prize against the northerners. Unable to reason with Theon, Yara is forced to leave him behind. [13] \nTheon and his paltry garrison are besieged by a large Bolton army led by Ramsay Snow , the bastard son of Roose Bolton , a vassal of the Starks. The Ironborn turn on Theon and hand him over to Ramsay in return for safe conduct. [14] However, Ramsay reneges on his offer and flays them alive. The capture of Theon is a major blow to House Greyjoy since it deprives Balon of his last remaining son and heir to the Seastone Chair . [15] Edit \nOver a prolonged period, Theon Greyjoy is tortured and emasculated by Ramsay Snow. Due to his experiences, Theon adopts the persona Reek and becomes totally subjugated to Ramsay. Theon later issues an ultimatum to Lord Balon Greyjoy demanding that he withdraw his forces from the North. Ramsay also threatens to send more \"bits\" of his son Theon and to flay every Ironborn in the North alive if his demands are not met. As a parting gift, Ramsay also presents Theon's severed penis. Unwilling to abandon the strongholds he has taken, Balon rejects Ramsay's demands. He also rejects his son Theon because he disobeyed his orders and cannot produce heirs to further the Greyjoy line. Defying her father's wishes, Yara assembles a team of Ironborn warriors to rescue her brother Theon. [15] Edit \nTheon Greyjoy has seemingly forgotten his former identity and embraced the persona \"Reek\". He is totally subservient to his master Ramsay. Upon returning to the Dreadfort, Roose Bolton reprimands his son Ramsay for torturing and emasculating Theon. As Balon's son and heir, he would have been a valuable hostage for him to trade with Balon in return for securing the withdrawal of Ironborn forces from the North. [16] \nLater, Yara and her warriors manage to infiltrate the Dreadfort and reach Theon's cell. However, fearing that it is another trap set up by his master, Theon spurns Yara's offer. Yara and her warriors are forced to flee when Ramsay unleashes his dogs on them. After reaching their boats, Yara regards her brother Theon to be \"dead\". [17] \nHaving proven his loyalty, Ramsay sends \"Reek\" on a mission to secure the surrender of the Ironborn garrison at Moat Cailin . For this mission, \"Reek\" has to pretend to be Theon. Identifying himself as Theon and Balon's last remaining heir, Reek addresses the Ironborn garrison telling them to surrender in return for safe passage. Despite being met by resistance from the garrison commander Ralf Kenning , his men accept Theon's offer and surrender to the Boltons. However, Ramsay reneges on his offer and has them flayed alive anyway. [18] Edit \nIn an attempt to reach out to Theon, Sansa Stark reminds him of his real name and position as Balon's only surviving son and heir. [19] Ultimately, Theon sheds his Reek persona and helps Sansa to escape the new Bolton stronghold of Winterfell . [20] Edit \nAfter being rescued from Bolton hunters by Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne , [21] Theon decides to part company with Sansa and her companions because he fears retribution from Jon Snow for his role in the disappearance of Bran and Rickon, and the murder of the two orphans. Theon takes one horse and travels towards the Iron Islands. [22] \nMeanwhile, the Greyjoys face another major setback with the loss of Deepwood Motte to the Glovers . With the War of the Five Kings over, the northern lords are returning to the North and pushing back the Ironborn gains. Yara Greyjoy counsels her father Balon to end his campaign to conquer the North but he refuses to back down. Later that night, Balon is murdered by Euron, who has returned to claim the Salt Throne . Following a struggle on a rope bridge, Euron throws Balon to his death in the sea. The following day, Balon's corpse is found by Yara and her uncle Aeron Greyjoy . While Yara intends to succed her father on the Salt Throne, Aeron announces that a kingsmoot will elect the new ruler of the Iron Islands. [22] \nTheon finally returns to Pyke and receives a cold reception from his sister Yara, who is still angry at him for spurning her rescue attempt at the Dreadfort, though her mood picks up when Theon pledges to support her claim to the Salt Throne. [23] At the Kingsmoot, Yara is able to win the support of many due to her reputation as a warrior and Theon's support. Yara promises to build a mighty fleet to conquer the mainland. However, Euron then challenges her candidacy by proposing an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen against the mainland. Euron wins the Kingsmoot and is crowned King of the Iron Islands following his baptism by Aeron. Meanwhile, Yara, Theon, and their supporters flee on the best ships in the Iron Fleet . In response, Euron orders his followers to build a new fleet and vow to kill his niece and nephew. [24] \nYara and Theon travel with the Iron Fleet to Essos where they plan to reach Daenerys before Euron arrives. On their way, they stop over at Volantis for rest and relaxation. The Ironborn frequent a bar where they are entertained by prostitutes. Yara tells a despondent and guilt-ridden Theon that she needs his support to forge an alliance with Daenerys and urges him to regain his confidence. She then leaves with a prostitute. [25] \nFollowing the Second Siege of Meereen , Yara and Theon meet with Daenerys Targaryen and her advisor Tyrion Lannister. Yara offers to provide a hundred ships to Dany if she can help them defeat Euron and recognize the independence of the Iron Islands with Yara as the Queen of the Iron Islands , as her brother Theon notes that he is not fit to rule, something that Tyrion agrees with. Daenerys agrees to their offer after securing a promise that the Ironborn will cease raiding and terrorizing the mainland. [26] \nThe ships of the Iron Fleet that Theon and Yara took after the kingsmoot are later seen sailing alongside the ships of House Tyrell , Dorne , and those of the former slave masters, which now bear the sails of House Targaryen .
