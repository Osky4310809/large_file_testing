The four members — Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall, and Leigh-Anne Pinnock — have been K-I-L-L-I-N-G it with their new material, from the happiest breakup banger ever written “Shoutout To Me Ex” to the fierce and sensual “Touch.” What’s more, we absolutely love that the Perrie, Jesy, Jade and Leigh-Anne are actually all really close friends, with Jesy telling us last year in an interview that they really look after each other. Aww!\nWell, Little Mix are BACK with another fierce AF music video for their track “No More Sad Songs,” which features Machine Gun Kelly. \nThe song is the third single to be lifted from the band’s fourth album Glory Days , and is another glorious breakup banger that sees the group attempt to forget about love lost by hitting the dance floor.\nThe video follows the group as they head on a night out to forget their woes. However, they end up in a country style dive bar, which from the looks on their faces wasn’t what they were expecting…\nColumbia Records/ www.youtube.com Despite perhaps not being the night spot that they were hoping for, the group throw themselves into the party mood, and even go full-on Coyote Ugly on the appreciative revellers. They even give the bucking bronco their best go…\nColumbia Records/ www.youtube.com Watch the video for “No More Sad Songs” below.\nMeanwhile, Little Mix — who are currently supporting Ariana Grande on her “Dangerous Woman” tour — recently performed a incredible cover of Rihanna’s sleeper hit “Love On The Brain,” and they are serving vocals for DAYZ.\nListen to the cover below.\nAmazing.\nLittle Mix’s fourth album Glory Days is available now.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T13:33:06.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
