Dwane Casey fears slide to pre-civil rights era. ▶ Kyle Lowry is pulling no punches when it comes to Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. (Mark Sheldon / Twitter) By Doug Smith Sports Reporter Mon., Jan. 30, 2017 Kyle Lowry takes great pride in representing Toronto and Canada as a professional athlete, but he is American born and bred and he lashed out at the United States government for its decision to ban refugees from seven primarily Muslim countries. “I think it’s absolutely bulls---,” the Philadelphia-born Raptors point guard said Monday afternoon. “I bleed red, white, and blue. I was born and raised there. I have always been taught to treat everyone the same. It’s a difficult time for my country right now and it’s sad.” As the NBA’s lone international team, one led by a Nigerian-born president, the Raptors have long been held as a shining example of inclusiveness. They have a global outlook on issues, and they value the fact they represent a country known as a beacon for refugees seeking better lives. They were dismayed by the weekend actions that let to massive protests less than a fortnight into U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. For Ujiri, there is little in life of which he is more proud than his work with the youth of his African home. Article Continued Below Through his own Giants of Africa foundation and work with the NBA’s Basketball Without Borders program, he lives to provide hope and inspiration, opportunity and encouragement to kids. He sees them as the boys and girls who can change the world for the better, and he wants desperately to advance that cause. Kyle Lowry is pulling no punches when it comes to Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. ( Richard Lautens / Toronto Star ) | Order this photo He watched with horror and astonishment on the weekend when the government of new American president Trump effectively banned immigration from seven countries, countries where Ujiri has worked to improve the lives of youngsters, countries he cares greatly about. “I’m finding it difficult to absorb some of this stuff, from the ban to everything that’s going on,” Ujiri said Monday. “I think it’s just ridiculous what’s going on out there. We had plan to do a basketball camp in Sudan. When you go and do those things . . . we have kids that come from all over the world. “Are we lying to those kids when we say we are giving them hope, or teaching them or going to help them grow, or give them opportunity? We’re outright lying to them now. I just don’t get it. It’s mind-boggling.” Ujiri and Lowry are not advocating a borderless world, where terrorists and those bent on destruction are allowed free passage anywhere in the world. They understand the need for protections, and that borders are sacrosanct and not everyone should be allowed to go anywhere they want. But the all-encompassing nature of the ban, the message it sends to those who want to better themselves, the opportunities it denies people, that’s what they are lashing out against. “I understand what the issues are and what the problems are, at least from (the perspective of) a layman,” Ujiri said. “I completely understand that and we do need to pay attention to security, 100 per cent, there is no doubt. But there are ways to deal with people. So, okay, so now we are stopping children that get scholarships to go to college from Sudan? What does that have to do with anything? “Those kids are hoping for growth in their lives. That’s what America is about. That’s the America we know.” They were not shy about sharing their opinions — Lowry repeated his “bulls---” comment three times. Neither was coach Dwane Casey, who fears a retrogression to the pre-civil rights era in the U.S. that he lived through in the 1960s. Ujiri, who proudly displays a picture of himself with former president Barack Obama in his office, was beside himself. “Sudan is part of my continent, you know? I have friends that are from there,” he said, “I just, I don’t think it’s a good place that we are in now, and that’s the honest truth.” It is an issue that transcends their professions, one they cannot and will not sit by and let go with no comment. “I think everyone in the world who has a voice has an obligation to speak out,” Lowry said. “At the end of the day I don’t get into politics. I really shy away from it because it’s not my thing. It’s not my expertise. But when it comes to having an opinion, that right there (the ban) bothers me. “NBA players, a lot of us just go out there and people don’t know that we do pay attention to everything. We care about our world. We care about our children growing up in this situation. I have two young children. I want them to grow up to be happy with who they are, and be proud of who they are in the situation in the country that they are in.” Read more about: Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.
