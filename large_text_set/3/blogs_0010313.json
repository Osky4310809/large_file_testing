So why obsess about it?” \nMarshall told the Charlatan that body measurements can change “dramatically” without big weight changes and that other useful indicators include cardiovascular fitness and overall strength. \nBut some students at the Canadian college aren’t down with removing the scale. \nMarko Miljusevic, a second-year computer science student, said in a Facebook message that “if they can’t handle the number that shows up on the scale,, then don’t step on it,” the Charlatan reported. \n“People that dislike how they look will dislike how they look regardless of a number being attached to it,” Miljusevic added, the paper reported. \nBut Samar El Faki, a first-year student, said taking away the scale helps those with eating disorders. \n“Scales are very triggering,” she wrote, according to the Charlatan. “I think people are being insensitive because they simply don’t understand. They think eating disorders are a choice when they are actually a serious illness.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:46:29.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
