Looking for booky fun? @PHEducation are hosting fab #WorldBookDay20 events with authors & illustrators. Details here https://t.co/oOH9JujRCM pic.twitter.com/Gifv83M7BC \n— World Book Day UK (@WorldBookDayUK) February 6, 2017 \n\nWorld Book Day is a celebration of books, authors, illustrators and reading.\nIt’s actually a pretty big deal with around 100 countries taking part in the day across the world.\nHundreds of bookshops, schools, publishers and others take part in the event to encourage people, primarily children, to read.\nBooks can often be found on sale for discounted prices and 15 million book tokens will be handed out to get more money off. The idea is that by ensuring children have access to books they have the opportunity to be able to find their love of reading.\nBooks, book tokens and resource packs with ideas and activities will also be sent to nurseries and secondary schools with ideas to get people involved.\nThe day is designed and organised by UNESCO.\nHow to take part in World Book Day (Picture: World Book Day) On an individual level, parents can get involved by ensuring their child has access to new books or even having a dabble at making their own book . There are plenty available through the World Book Day website for as little as £1 each . You can also find information about local bookstores here .\nResource packs can also be downloaded from the World Book Day website with plenty of ideas and activities to try, from dressing children up as their favourite book characters to writing their own short story.\nEducational videos about books can also be found on the website here and there’s a forum for advice from book experts here .\nThere’s also a World Book Day helpline for more information, questions, problems, ideas or anything that’s worth sharing.\nPhone calls are £1 a minute from landlines (mobiles will cost more) 0906 265 0004 but you can also email wbd@education.co.uk for free.\nOn social media the hashtag for the day is #WorldBookDay20 and the UK Twitter account can be found tweeting at @WorldBookDayUK \nWhat about charity work? This embed is invalid\nYes. Book Aid International is once again working with the World Book Day team to raise awareness of childhood literacy.\nMany schools will be encouraging children to donate £1 to Book Aid on World Book Day (usually in exchange for being able to dress up as their favourite book character).\nIt costs the charity £2 to send out books to children, library and schools in Africa so all money raised will go towards ensuring all children have access to reading material.\nBook Aid International’s head of fundraising Hannah Watson said: ‘Last year, schools across the country raised enough to send 60,000 books to African readers who lack books in their homes, schools and communities.\n‘Those books have the potential to be life-changing, particularly for children who may never have even seen a children’s book before.\n‘We are so pleased to include prominent voices from the world of children’s literature in our World Book Day celebrations this year and draw attention to the huge value that children’s books bring.’\nMORE: Read a Book Day: 13 reasons to start reading immediately \nMORE: World Book Day: 10 life lessons we learnt from books ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:04:43.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
