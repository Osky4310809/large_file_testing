Osinbanjo said the Federal Government, in its determination to achieve its development objectives in the Niger Delta area, would treat oil producing communities as special development areas. The Vice-President spoke in Umuahia, Abia State capital during a one-day town hall meeting with Abia indigenes in line with the Federal Government’s plan to deal with the challenges of the oil producing states in the country. He said, “In November 2016, the Niger Delta Forum visited President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa and submitted a 16-point road map on how to develop the oil producing communities. “The President therefore decided that there must be an interaction with the people and the leaders of the communities, to hear them, seek an understanding about their problems and concerns and present a new road map to develop the oil producing communities.” He said it was common knowledge that most people in the oil producing communities only hear about oil wells without benefiting from the wealth. Osinbajo said that oil producing communities must be made the hub of the petrochemical industry and the power sector to create employment opportunities for youths in the area. Copyright PUNCH.
