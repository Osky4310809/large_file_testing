He has to grow from this,” Tomlin said. “It was foolish of him to do that, selfish and inconsiderate.” \nThe coach added the All-Pro wide receiver will be punished “swiftly” but added Brown will be available for Sunday’s AFC championship game against the Patriots. \n“I will see him at one point and will address it. It will be done internally,” Tomlin said. \n“He’s a great player, respected largely in the locker room but incidents such as this don’t help him in that regard,” Tomlin finished. \nBrown’s video was viewed more than a million times before being taken down. \nIn it, Tomlin can be heard using several expletives, including one directed at New England because the Patriots will have an extra day of preparation by virtue of beating Houston on Saturday, a full 24 hours before Pittsburgh ousted the Chiefs. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
