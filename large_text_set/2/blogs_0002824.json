What you see ainâ€™t always what you get. I once responded to a Craigslist ad for a sofa from a fella named Bill. All I had to do was pay him $15 and help him unload it from his truck. Two weeks in a pit and several bottles of lotion later, I finally got that sofa back to my apartment â€” only to find it had a huge tear in the side. \nIâ€™m far from alone here. Lots of people have been screwed over by sheisty Craiglist ads. Thatâ€™s why the internet is cracking up over this hilariously honest listing for a 2002 Oldsmobile Olero.
