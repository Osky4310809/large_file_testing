Council members tend to tune them out, burying noses in digital diversions. But not this past Wednesday. \nThis week, two women and one man, none of whom had ever before stepped foot in City Hall, walked to the podium to tell the mayor and council a compelling and unfamiliar tale in desperate need of a happy ending. In a nutshell: Some 70 people, once homeless, are back on their feet again because of a city program few have ever heard of. And they are in danger of having their homes yanked out from under them. Dallas loves planning to plan to help the homeless, and that has to stop \nEffie Young went to the podium first, introducing the trio as clients of the city's little-known Gateway to Permanent Supportive Housing Program, which, using a relatively small amount of federal funds each year, puts roofs over the heads of dozens of men and women who had once been homeless. The 57-year-old explained to the council that there were strict guidelines — monthly meetings with on-site caseworkers, drug testing and alcohol counseling, a demand that clients eventually become self-sufficient. \n\"We are good neighbors,\" she said, \"and responsible citizens.\" \nThe program, which began nine years ago as a way to rapidly rehouse ex-offenders taking baby steps back into The World, went unmentioned in recent months during meetings of the Dallas Commission on Homelessness. Google's just as useless, turning up a handful of empty hits. Dallas City Hall, hamstrung and perplexed as ever about how to solve or even address The Homeless Problem, has a success on its hands, by all accounts. \nBut the best the city seems able to come up with at the moment is talking about creating yet another commission. Meanwhile, a real solution is staring them in the face, screaming for help.

(Robert Wilonsky/Staff writer) \n\"We're the best-kept secret,\" Young would tell me later. We were standing outside council chambers, along with half a dozen other Gateway participants — men and women, black and white. She said it with a laugh. But not because she finds this at all funny. \nThat's because for now, at least, the participants live in the sprawling Eban Village apartment complex across Robert B. Cullum Boulevard from Fair Park. But owner Alvin Johnson has opted not to renew his agreement with the city; when asked why Thursday, he would say only, \"No comment.\" \nNow Young and the other program participants are desperately in need of new digs. And time is running out. They are all on month-to-month leases, with no place to go. Dallas is giving away tiny houses to the homeless \n\"If we could duplicate the program 100 times over, that would be real helpful,\" Housing Department director Bernadette Mitchell told me Wednesday afternoon. But finding even one complex willing to accept the residents has been \"difficult in this market,\" she said. \"And there are NIMBY issues. People have a mental picture of who this means.\" \nSeveral council members — among them Tiffinni Young, whose district includes Eban Village — said they'd never even heard of the program, which costs around $802,000 annually, a fraction of the $6.2 million CitySquare spent to build 50 cottages for the homeless near downtown. Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance actually makes the program possible: It applies each year for a grant through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Continuum of Care program. But the city runs it, providing three caseworkers who make sure the participants are living up to their end of the bargain. \nEffie Young, who will graduate next year from El Centro College's Business Office Systems and Support program, told me the program saved her life when she first got housing in 2008. The dozen residents who joined her at City Hall Wednesday said the exact same thing. \n\"It is very important we not become homeless again,\" Young told council members Wednesday. Most had put down their phones and were paying rapt attention. \"My fellow residents and I do not want to take two steps backwards when we've already made several steps forward.\" \nLuther Fenton spoke to the council as well, his voice breaking as he read from prepared remarks. The 54-year-old told me after the meeting he was in Pegasus Plaza downtown when a caseworker approached him and told him about the program. Fenton said he was incredulous, but a couple of urine tests later, he was in an apartment. He remembers the exact date: Nov. 1, 2012. \n\"And I still pinch myself to this day,\" he said, his voice cracking. \"It saved my life. Now we're going to be kicked out? It's like kicking you in the teeth.\" \nMDHA's president and CEO Cindy Crain said she's looking for a new place, but it's difficult to find a landlord with room for 70 people and an office for caseworkers. And others, she said, \"don't want to work with programs where rents are subsidized and they can get a higher rent. It's market-driven and has nothing to do with the behavior of tenants.\" \nWorst-case scenario, she said, she will have to divvy up the program participants. But the men and women who came to City Hall on Wednesday don't want that. They attend meetings with each other, and volunteer at homeless shelters and food pantries when not out looking for work, taking part-time jobs or attending school. \n\"We're a family,\" Young said. \nHarvey Pollard, 59, credits the city's Gateway to Permanent Supportive Housing Program with saving his life. He's not the only one. (Louis DeLuca/Staff Photographer) Eban Village no longer wants the Gateway program participants. Its owner will not say why. (Louis DeLuca/Staff photographer) \nThursday morning I went to Eban Village to see Harvey Pollard, a 59-year-old born in Natchez, Miss., who's one of the newer participants — since March of last year. He moved to Dallas in the 1970s with his brothers, who were working in a downtown hat factory. Pollard worked plenty, he said, but somewhere along the way, \"I got all the way twisted up, at least until I found myself.\" \nHe said he'd recently worked at the downtown convention center but injured his back; he lives off SNAP Food Benefits and awaits a disability check. He said he spends his days volunteering at shelters and food banks and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. \n\"An idle mind is the devil's workshop,\" said Pollard, who'd been at The Bridge when he found out about the program last year. \"My mama taught me that. So I do what I do.\" Housing the homeless in an old Dallas jail looks awful — but it's better than nothing \nPollard, who'd also been at City Hall on Wednesday, was eager to show off his immaculate apartment, to prove he's a solid citizen now, thanks to the Gateway program. As we spoke in a kitchen where every box is arranged on shelves by height, he leaned on two carefully stacked Bibles. \n\"I thank God for this,\" he said. \"If this program wasn't here, I think I would be dead somewhere. This program saved a whole lot of lives. Saved mine. Very much so. I hate to see it end. So we pray.\" \nHe said he wishes he could get council members over to his house, to see how he and the others have managed to thrive after having once been written off as a problem in need of solving. He said he brings Bridge clients to see his place, to show them a possible future. \n\"If I can do it, you can do it,\" he said he tells them. \"Anything is possible, sir. You can go down, but you can always pick yourself back up.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:56:29.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
