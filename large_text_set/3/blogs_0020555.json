Cafe Luna switched from its spot on Massachusetts Avenue to Main Street, according to Boston Restaurant Talk , and it is now up and running in its new home with a menu expansion to come. Cafe Luna serves breakfast and lunch on weekdays and is known for its crowd-drawing weekend brunch. The menu features decadences like lobster and avocado omelettes, chocolate chip Belgian waffles, French toast, eggs Benedict, and honey butter biscuits, among other offerings. The restaurant will only accept walk-ins through April 1 and will then start taking reservations at 612 Main St. Cafe Luna is open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Update, 3/22, 2 p.m.: The Cafe Luna team also acquired the space at 2344 Massachusetts Ave. that was formerly home to Vernaâ€™s Donut Shop, which will be used as a base for its catering, according to owner Teri Haymer. There will be a small cafe in the front of the space that will serve sandwiches, salads, and coffee, plus take-out hot entrees for the end of the day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:18:34.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
