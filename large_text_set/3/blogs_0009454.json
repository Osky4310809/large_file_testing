Al Franken (D-MN) grilling Deputy Attorney General nominee Rod Rosenstein while hammering Attorney General Jeff Sessions over the letter he submitted to amend his testimony , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley rebuked Franken over what he labeled as “gotcha” questions. \nWith Franken having just chastised Rosenstein for not reading the declassified report on Russia’s activities, Grassley lit into the Democratic lawmaker. Bringing up one of Franken’s questions of Sessions at the Attorney General confirmation hearing, Grassley claimed Franken had tried to set Sessions up because he knew Sessions didn’t know the answer. \n“You probably should have given him a chance to get the information you had and reflect on it, and give an answer in writing,” Grassley noted. “If I was going to ask you a gotcha question, I was going to tell you about it ahead of time and I consider what Senator Franken asked Sessions at that late moment that that story just come out is a gotcha question!” \n“It was not a gotcha question, sir,” Franken shot back. \n“It was, from the standpoint that he didn’t know what you were asking about,” the chairman responded. \nFranken would explain that when he asked Sessions the question he told the then-AG nominee that he didn’t expect him to know the answer, but Grassley wasn’t having any of it. \nWatch the clip above, via MSNBC. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:52:11.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
