Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAs of the writing of this post, the Atlanta Falcons are crushing the Green Bay Packers 31-7 in the NFC Championship game being held in Atlanta, GA, which just happens to be the congressional district of Rep. John Lewis. A district which President Trump said: Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to…… \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017 mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk – no action or results. Sad! \n— Donald J.

Is this anyway to treat visitors to the city? Julio Jones ladies and gentlemen. #GBvsATL pic.twitter.com/pfBKj2Y52Z \n— Dylan (@DylansFreshTake) January 22, 2017 \nMany others have been making variations of the same joke.
