I would like to also pass on my story. \nMy grandparents came to the U.S. from Norway in pursuit of a better life, like so many other immigrants at the time. My Mother and I sat at the kitchen table one day when I was about 8 years old. We had a large bay window that overlooked our yard. A sparrow flew up to the window where we were sitting, coming inches from the glass and just hovered, fluttering its wings. But the strange thing was, the bird was actually making eye contact with my mother. \nMy mother said in a frightened tone, \"Oh no. Please go away!\" My mom turned away from the window and the sparrow flew off. My Mother then went on to say, \"When I was your age, your grandma and I were sitting just like we are now and a sparrow flew up to the window and looked in at us and your grandmother said, \"Oh my, we are going to have a death in the family shortly.\" \ncontinue reading below our video Celebrity Breakups of 2015 We Didn't See Coming \nMy mom went on to say her mother had told her that it's an old Norwegian omen that when a death is about to occur a sparrow will deliver to you the message via eye contact. Mom went on to say that she and her mom were on the patio one day and the sparrow flew up and fluttered in front of my grandmom's face. My grandma began to cry and said, \"I don't want to lose anyone right now.\" My mom said, \"Would you believe grandma died two weeks later?\" \nI know this sounds like a silly superstition, but over the past 30 years, every time a sparrow does this, within two weeks someone close to me dies. When the sparrow does this, you know it's not some random bird. The sparrow will actually peck at the window to get your attention; it will behave in a unnatural manner of a wild animal. The bird will look you in the eyes; it will do whatever it takes to get your attention, then fly off. \nWhen I was in my early 20s, my boyfriend and I were cleaning his father's basement. They had a broken window down there and they had just put some heavy plastic over the window until they could replace it. As we were cleaning, my boyfriend said, \"What is with this crazy bird?\" \nI looked over and he was standing in front of the broken window and here was a sparrow in the window well, pecking at the plastic. My boyfriend poked the plastic back and the bird started poking more frantically. I yelled, \"Get away from it!\" He then slapped the plastic with his hand and the sparrow stood there in the window well and just stared at him and then flew up and away. \nHe said, \"That was one fearless bird.\" \nI told him, \"Someone is going to die. That's an omen .\" He laughed at me, but 1-1/2 weeks later his uncle passed away. \nI could not count how many times this has happened over the years. Now when it does happen, I put a small \"S\" on the calender, because despite how many times it has occurred, I still find it unbelievable, but mark my word, a death always occurs shortly after these strange sparrow encounters. \nBack in 2008, I was washing dishes and -- lo and behold -- a sparrow came up to the window and made eye contact. I was sick. I knew that bizarre behavior from this bird. That afternoon my kids were playing outside and they came barreling into the house and slammed the door. My one girl said, \"Mom, there's a million birds on our roof!\" That's when I could hear them just squawking! People walking their dogs and doing yard work all stopped and just stared at my house. \nTen days later, my mother passed away. \nMy last experience was last fall. I woke to my four Chihuahuas going insane at the back glass sliding doors to the deck. The dogs were barking frantically at a sparrow standing on the other side of the glass, just staring in. The bird was not the least bit frightened by these ballistic dogs charging the glass. I ordered the dogs away. I squatted down and looked directly at the sparrow. I wondered if it was sick. injured? No, he was standing strong, clear eyes, just staring at me. \nI waved my hand at it. Didn't flinch. I got afraid and closed the blinds. The sparrow stayed at the door for about three minutes and then flew off. \nAbout four days later, I was outside raking leaves and my neighbor came out and told me, \"My Mother passed away yesterday.\" I couldn't believe it. I know some people are thinking coincidence , but honestly, how many times can it be a coincidence ? \nSparrows are everywhere and I understand that, but when these birds are here to deliver a message, their behavior is not of a wild bird. It is truly abnormal and it leaves you knowing exactly why it was there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T18:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T18:40:28.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
