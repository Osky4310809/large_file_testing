He wants America to be basically Christian and white. So keep out the Mexicans, keep out the Muslims, etc.,” Springer explained. The “Jerry Springer Show” host also said Twitter is like a “drug” for the president. “[Trump] can’t get the mainstream media, because obviously, they won’t respect him,” Springer added. “So, therefore, he goes to the things he can control. That’s the tabloid journalism or the Twitter account. So, Trump gets his drug, and Bannon gets the goal of doing away with mainstream media.” Follow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T18:26:34.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
