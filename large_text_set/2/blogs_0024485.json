Harvie Wilkinson, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, in agreeing with the opinion. The sky is not falling. However, there is perhaps a glimmer of sunlight. \nJudge Wilkinson wrote, “To say in the wake of so many mass shootings in so many localities across this country that the people themselves are now to be rendered newly powerless, that all they can do is stand by and watch as federal courts design their destiny — this would deliver a body blow to democracy as we have known it since the very founding of this nation.” \nYeah...what he said.
