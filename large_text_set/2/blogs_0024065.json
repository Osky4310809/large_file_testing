Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\nFor more about Apple, watch : \nAdditionally, Cook said this week that he would honor Jobs by naming Apple’s new auditorium the Steve Jobs Theater. The auditorium is located at Apple’s new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., which the company will start to move into in April.\nThe campus Steve envisioned will be known as Apple Park, and its theater will bear his name. https://t.co/O0BEOdncDq \n— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) February 22, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:31:41.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
