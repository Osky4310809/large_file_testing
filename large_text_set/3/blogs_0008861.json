Dejan Lovren played 75 minutes with the Liverpool under-23s on Monday. \n\"He was fine,\" Garrity said. \"I think he could have completed the full game if he wanted to. But we were happy to get to 75 and he was happy with that. \n\"He looked strong and his authority and experience was really nice for the boys out there. \n\"[I found out he would be playing] this morning.
