I thought it was big dog,\" Lila told the news outlet.\nShe bravely leapt into action, pulling the goanna by its tail out of the venue. The moment was captured and posted on the Mimosa Wines Facebook page .\nWhile some commenters on the video have noted that dragging a goanna by its tail is cruel, Lila said she was trying to be gentle in removing the intruder.\n\"I like reptiles, I think he is a really beautiful creature [and] I didn't want to hurt him,\" she said.
