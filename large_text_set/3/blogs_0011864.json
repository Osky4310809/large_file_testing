Alas, the war on salt has had a number of drawbacks and unintended consequences. \nFor starters, evidence shows having the correct potassium to sodium balance influences your risk for hypertension and heart disease to a far greater extent than high sodium alone, and the Western diet tends to be lacking in potassium. \nMoreover, when lowering salt in processed foods, many manufacturers took to adding monosodium glutamate (MSG) instead — a flavor enhancer associated with a number of health problems, including obesity , headaches, fatigue and depression . \nDue to its ability to overexcite neurons, MSG may even raise your risk for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's , Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease. War on Salt Is Misguided \nIn 2010, New York City launched the National Salt Reduction Initiative, a salt-reduction plan aimed at lowering salt in processed foods and restaurant meals by 25 percent in the next four years. \nTwo years later, Dr. Sean Lucan of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine wrote an article published online in the American Journal of Public Health, saying: 1 \n\"We cannot extrapolate that lowering sodium consumption would reduce cardiovascular risk or premature death. Despite assertions to the contrary, we do not know that reducing mean population sodium intake would decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease or save lives.\" \nAt the time, Lucan told The New York Post: 2 \n\"We can't just swallow this as fact — there's actually debate about this. My concern is that they're focusing on a single ingredient that the food industry is going to have to replace with something — and what they replace it with might be more damaging.\" \nLucan also noted that the relationship between sodium and blood pressure is inconsistent and from a clinical standpoint, insubstantial. \nMoreover, he stressed that some studies actually show a low-salt diet can worsen cardiovascular disease and raise rather than lower the risk for early death among patients at high risk of heart disease . \nIn addition, lowering salt intake could also decrease insulin sensitivity and have an adverse effect on blood lipids. Correctly, Lucan noted that \"Refined carbohydrates are a greater enemy.\" Potassium Level Impacts High Blood Pressure More Than Sodium \nStudies have clearly shown that having the correct balance of potassium to sodium is far more important than lowering salt alone. Potassium is a naturally occurring mineral your body uses as an electrolyte (substance in solution that conducts electricity), and it is vital for optimal health and normal functioning. \nPotassium works in your body to relax the walls of your arteries, keep your muscles from cramping, and lowers your blood pressure. 3 The reduction in blood pressure with added potassium has also been associated in studies with a reduced risk of stroke. 4 \nWhile diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating (such as when using a sauna) and some drugs may deplete or disrupt your potassium balance, the most common reason for low potassium is eating a potassium-poor diet. \nIf you're eating mostly processed foods, your sodium-to-potassium balance is virtually guaranteed to be inversed. \nThe average reported intake of potassium from food is about half of the 4,700 mg recommended. 5 Research demonstrates these low levels of potassium may have a significant impact on blood pressure, especially when combined with too much salt. \nDr. Paul Welton, professor of epidemiology at Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, analyzed 29 trials that demonstrated low levels of potassium resulted in higher systolic blood pressure readings. 6 Studies performed since then have found similar results. 7 , 8 According to Welton: 9 \n\"The evidence is very strong and very consistent. A higher potassium intake may blunt the effects of excess salt on blood pressure. Potassium's effect is bigger in people who have higher blood pressure, bigger in older people, bigger in people who are consuming a lot of salt and bigger in black people.\" The Many Benefits of Potassium \nRecent research found that women without hypertension who consumed the most potassium (nearly 3,200 mg/day) had a 21 percent reduced risk of stroke. Further, women who consumed the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to die during the study period than those who consumed the least. 10 \nAdequate amounts of potassium are also associated with quicker recovery from exercise and improved muscle strength. 11 , 12 As an electrolyte, potassium helps to regulate the fluid balance in your cells and throughout your body. 13 \nThis fluid balance is essential to maintaining life, preventing dehydration at the cellular level and maintaining brain function. 14 \nFor example, potassium is important in the transmission of nerve impulses in your brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. 15 Nerve impulses transmitting information from one nerve to the next happens as the result of electrical activity. This activity is what an electrocardiogram measures as it tracks heart activity. \nLow levels of potassium have also been linked with high levels of insulin and glucose, associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. 16 These results have been found in several studies, 17 leading researchers to recommend dietary choices that boost potassium levels and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Sodium/Potassium Ratio Is Key to Strong Muscles and Relaxed Arteries \nThe key to relaxing your arterial walls and reducing your blood pressure is the sodium-to-potassium ratio . If you eat a lot of processed foods and few fresh vegetables, there's a good chance your sodium-to-potassium ratio is unbalanced. \nIf you're unsure, use cron-ometer.com/mercola , a nutrient tracker that allows you to enter the foods you eat and then calculates the ratio automatically. It's generally recommended that you consume five times more potassium than sodium, but most Americans eat twice as much sodium as potassium. \nThis ratio is far more important for your health than your overall salt intake, 18 and a better strategy to promote public health would be to forgo the strict sodium reduction element and focus recommendations on a high-quality diet rich in potassium instead, as this nutrient helps offset the hypertensive effects of sodium. \nImbalance in this ratio can not only lead to high blood pressure but also contribute to a number of other health problems, including: \n✓ Kidney stones", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:48:48.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
