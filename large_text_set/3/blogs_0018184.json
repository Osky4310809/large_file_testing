Golden State will now monitor Durant’s response to increased intensity in rehab work.\nDurant injured his left leg early in a Feb. 28 loss to the Washington Wizards after Warriors big man Zaza Pachulia accidentally fell into his knee. The Warriors said Durant would be reevaluated after a month.\nThe Warriors were a shell of their championship selves without their former MVP , though they have rebounded of late with four convincing victories in a row.\nDurant averaged 25 points, 8.2 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 1.6 blocks per game, solidifying himself as the team’s leading scorer, rebounder, and shot blocker this season. Golden State is currently 7-5 since his injury after going 50-9 beforehand.\nOver the summer, Durant made the decision to leave Oklahoma City for a Golden State team that eliminated his Thunder during last season’s Western Conference Finals. He signed a two-year, $54 million contract with a player option for the second year — one he is expected to decline in order to re-sign with the Warriors for a maximum contract.\nIt makes sense to get Durant back on the floor during the regular season, if he’s able. Getting a near 100 percent KD back before the playoffs hit would allow the Warriors to re-acclimate to having their best player back on the floor. It would allow for Durant to get game action under his belt without the pressure that comes in a playoff atmosphere.\nWhile the Warriors should not rush him back to the floor, getting their All-Star forward back before the postseason would be a blessing for a team looking to make its third consecutive NBA Finals appearance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:33:38.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
