(AP) — A New Jersey judge says a criminal complaint against Republican Gov. Chris Christie over the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal in 2013 can go forward.\nMunicipal Court Judge Roy McGeady announced his ruling Thursday in a complaint that accuses the governor of failing to stop subordinates from purposely creating traffic jams to punish a Democratic mayor who didn’t endorse him.\nApplause erupted in the courtroom when McGeady announced his ruling.\nMcGeady quoted from testimony from the federal trial of two former Christie aides before ruling there was probable cause to believe Christie knew the lane reductions were more than just a routine traffic study.\nChristie has denied knowledge of the scheme until weeks or months later.\nThe governor is to appear March 10 in municipal court on a criminal summons.\n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
