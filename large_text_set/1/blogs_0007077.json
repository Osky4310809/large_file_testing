In addition to the rehab therapy, he’s going on the field to do progressive work with an eye toward being with the group soon.” \nChivas coach Matias Almeyda still can call on Isaac Brizuela and Javier \"La Chofis\" Lopez on the wing, while Rodolfo Pizarro could make his Chivas debut in midfield after joining from Pachuca in the offseason. Alan Pulido and Angel Zaldivar are options to start up top. \nAfter making the quarterfinals last season, Chivas are hoping to start strong Saturday against Pumas, which also was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Apertura.
