Posted 18 hours ago 9 \nAlice in Chains guitar mastermind Jerry Cantrell recently contributed to the soundtrack of upcoming action movie \"John Wick: Chapter 2,\" starring Keanu Reeves. \nThe track is a result of Jerry's collaboration with Tyler Bates, the composer of the film's score. \nCantrell stated: \"I really dug 'John Wick' and have always admired Keanu's work. When the opportunity arose to create a song for the second film, Tyler Bates and I wrote and recorded 'A Job to Do', a theme song for the character. Can't wait to see it!\" \nBates added: \"Jerry and I are friends and neighbors. We got together to jam and came up with the music. He's a fan of the first John Wick movie and wrote the lyrics from John Wick's introspective.\" \nYou can listen to the track below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:33:55.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
