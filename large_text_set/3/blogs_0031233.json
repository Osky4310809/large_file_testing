Wotherspoon beat off competition from the likes of Kyle Ng, Chen Tianzhou, and Venus X to take the gong.\nHis kaleidoscopic corduroy sneaker is said to be inspired by vintage caps from the ’80s. The shoe will now be prepped for a wider release next year.\n\nThis Saturday, the celebrations continued further as Travis Scott played a surprise show in La Brea Ave, Los Angeles. As Scott announced the performance just 30 minutes prior to taking the stage, the block unsurprisingly came to a standstill. As you’d expect, Wotherspoon was in a celebratory mood and can be seen in the gallery below (slides 1 and 4).\nAbout to do show on labrea in 30 mins.\n— TRAVIS SCOTT (@trvisXX) March 26, 2017 \n\nHappy AIR MAX DAY hitting the stage in 30 mins @Nike pic.twitter.com/FSHrpTvXzS \n— TRAVIS SCOTT (@trvisXX) March 26, 2017 \n\nAre you happy with the winner?
