This movie is just... bad. And here are its sins.” \nAssemble a team of the world’s most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government’s disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren’t picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it’s every man for himself? \nWritten and directed by David Ayer, the film starred Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, and Viola Davis. The cast also included Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Scott Eastwood, Cara Delevingne, Adam Beach, and Karen Fukuhara in her feature film debut. \nSuicide Squad: The Extended Cut is now available on Digital HD, Blu-ray, and DVD.
