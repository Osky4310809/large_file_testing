Literally. The new addition comes after customers made a plea to the company , started by a Victoria’s Secret alum, for a wire-free bra for gals with larger cup sizes. Enter the Busty Bralette ($35), designed for cup sizes 34D to 36DDD, that will make its official debut on Sunday, March 26. All together now: YAAAS! With their expanded new size range, Lively also updated their The Real Girl Fit Guide , a campaign starring real women that helps you find your perfect fit, to include bustier sizes. Who will purchase the Busty Bralette? We want to know @BritandCo .
