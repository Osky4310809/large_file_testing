He acknowledged that he’s got some big shoes to fill (how many times has that joke been made today), and that he aspires to “make Peter proud.”\nI’m ecstatic. It’s official. And here is my statement to this terrific piece of news https://t.co/a1DPsNDb2P pic.twitter.com/r4EUZ2r17V \n— Joonas Suotamo (@JoonasSuotamo) February 21, 2017 \nOne fact of nature nobody can argue with (… yet) is that people grow old. Despite pop culture and Hollywood’s often odd, misplaced priorities in fighting the aging process, sometimes folks just have to up and call it quits. The same goes for Mayhew, the original actor to don the Chewbacca costume in just about every Star Wars movie or Chewbacca television appearance since 1977.\nBut according to io9 , Mayhew’s disabled, and has been since The Force Awakens started filming. Still, though, he wore the suit and acted in as many scenes as he could, with Suotamo filling in for some of the more physically demanding scenes. Going forward, one can expect that Suotamo will just be rocking the Chewbacca outfit for as long as he can stand it. And given how much genuinely heartfelt emotion he’s plugged into this letter, the role really is his to lose.\nThe still untitled Han Solo Star Wars Story is officially scheduled to come out May 25th, 2018.\n(image via Lucasfilm)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
