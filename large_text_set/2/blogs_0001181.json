It also means that it has been 69 days without news of more episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . The ending is very open-ended, and the possibility of MORE episodes has been floating around in the air for some time. But, will the Netflix gods smile down upon us, and bless us with more Lorelai and Rory Gilmore?\nThe idea is out there. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has said that if the world wills it, she’d be game to go back to Stars Hollow . All the cast members are actually up for another trip to Luke’s, and it’s a nice thing to think about, and hold onto in these dark times.\nOr, well, it was a nice idea until Milo Ventimiglia came along and DASHED our hopes and dreams. On the off chance you’re not keeping track, yes, he is so far the first cast member to be like, “ actually …” In a new interview with Variety , the one-time bad boy Jess (and current star of NBC’s hit, This Is Us) opens up about what it’s like to be playing more ~adult~ roles now. He also touches on his time with Rory, and that’s when he drops the big Gilmore Girls bombshell. Though in the past he’s said that there COULD be more, now he’s leaning more towards the let’s-not-push-it crowd.\n“If [creators] Dan Palladino or Amy Sherman-Palladino ever called me [for more episodes], of course [I’d do them]. They are the reason why I show up. Amy created Jess, and I loved speaking her words,” Milo begins and then…\n“But I do kind of feel like audiences shouldn’t get so greedy. They were given a last serving of pie — why don’t we just leave it at that?” Oh my gosh, does it feel like the walls are suddenly closing in around you?\nIf that’s not enough, Milo then twists the sharp Gilmore Girls knife a little bit more. When asked as to whether or not he’s thought about the father of Rory’s future baby, Milo explains:\n“No, nor have I spent any time wondering. Let me be real honest: When I worked on the show, that was my present but that’s 13 years in the rearview for me now so I don’t spend what little free time I have wondering about the baby of a past TV flame.” U , [ whispers ] Milo has actually commented on the baby ( multiple times ), but that’s neither here nor there anymore because we’re too busy freaking out about the idea of NO MORE GILMORE GIRLS .\nKeep in mind, this is just Milo’s response to the future of the show, should Netflix bring it back for more episodes. He spells out that he’s up for returning if it happens, but maybe we shouldn’t ~get greedy~, so maybe don’t hold your breath for another trip to the Dragonfly Inn.\nNow excuse us, we have to go cry into a cup of coffee.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:20:52.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
