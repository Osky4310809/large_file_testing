anonymity attracted drug dealers and tax evaders, is on a roll again, according to a Financial Times report But after a renewed price spike that echoes its first speculative bubble three years ago, even many of the currency’s backers warn that another sharp correction is likely to follow. Bitcoin first boomed in 2013 as speculators and libertarian idealists — along with assorted lawbreakers — were drawn to the idea of a currency designed to be beyond the reach of central banks and national regulators. Tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists also jumped on the bandwagon, betting that it would become a platform for a disruptive new financial services industry. The currency’s price later fell back more than 80 per cent from its high, after a cyber-heist from its biggest exchange and growing attention from regulators. Since then, most people in the financial world have written it off as a failed experiment in digital finance, even though the idea behind a core part of its technology — the blockchain, a distributed ledger that simplifies transaction processing — has since moved across into mainstream finance. However, after a 31 per cent jump since the start of December, bitcoin has more than doubled this year, pushing the value of the outstanding currency to $16bn. Prices being quoted on the currency’s unregulated exchanges, though still some 14 per cent below the peak, are higher than at any time besides a handful of days during the first, frenzied boom. The digital currency was at about $975 on Friday. The fact that bitcoin has revived despite the wave of bad publicity has fed hopes that it will eventually fulfil the ideals it once aroused, of a digital currency beyond the influence of national governments. “It’s incredibly resilient,” said Adam White, head of GDAX, an exchange run by the US digital currency company Coinbase. Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who was an early backer, claimed the recovery showed bitcoin was becoming “a viable alternative when people’s confidence in their own government’s currency waivers.” He added: “The world will be a freer, wealthier, and smoother operating place as we apply more and more uses to bitcoin and the blockchain.” Critics warn that the bitcoin bounce has all the characteristics of a new speculative bubble and that its wild volatility, along with the idealistic hopes of supporters, make it more akin to an overhyped tech stock than a practical currency. Prices are largely set in China, where more than 90 per cent of the world’s trading takes place, and even backers say it is difficult to understand the dynamics behind the currency.   Taiwo Ojoye Justin \nAmaechi should have said “I want to be VP to protect Rivers people” instead. Amaechi keeps on nagging he was elected to lead Rivers people. Please tell me the date your FIRST election held and the number of votes that made you governor. Amaechi said in the papers only last week he would gather Rivers people in the liberation stadium and tell them before he decamps to APC but this has not been the case. Nigerians are still battling with lies from teachers that told them they would be leaders of tomorrow. Why does Amaechi lie to me all the time? Jagaban \nYou lack Common sense. Where were you in 2011 when he won re-eletion?. Omoale jati-jati! Justin \nHaving a short memory does not confer common sense. I’m surprised that’s all you can remember! Yusufu Akiku \nJagaban,You are the real Omoale jati-jati. With the Yoruba Master thiefs . You have it coming. Now, you have what is presumed being stolen. By the time they are done with you and Rivers State you will have NOTHING left to steal. May God help you and the people of Rivers State. Over rated so called Governor. No common sense. Mumu and the mumu kingdom of Rivers. Real Dance just wan begin!!!! tonio_biano \nthe worst form of government, military despotism, to the supposedly best political system, democracy, was exhilarating to most Nigerians. It elicited expectations from the people – high, but somewhat confused expectations. From democracy, they expected all that were absent from military rule. The last set of military leaders was disgustingly, nauseatingly corrupt. They ran the country aground, ruined every public institution and brought untold hardship on the people. So, from democracy, the people anticipated a resuscitation of the country’s institutions left comatose by military rule, the revamping of the economy and a conspicuously palpable improvement in their quality of life. Normally, democracy should offer much more than these mundane. Acting either out of their own ignorance, or disingenuously exploiting the confusion of the masses, the ruling elite are trying to equate this enrichment of the people’s lives expected from democracy to the dividend of democracy. So, for the dividend of democracy, they reel out statistics and TV footages of their administrations’ successes in infrastructural development and provision of social amenities. As there are very little in our daily lives that give the impression that the politicians are genuinely committed to using this country’s enormous wealth to better the lives of ordinary Nigerians, one tends to wonder if these statistics are doctored and the TV footages orchestrated. However, let us believe that the statistics and TV productions are real. Then, is the construction and maintenance of roads, building of additional class rooms and maternity wards, laying the foundation stones for a new university or polytechnic, provision of pipe-borne water, etc, the dividends of democracy? Is it not obvious that we do not need democracy to have good roads, additional class rooms, water, electricity, etc?In the early 1970s, the oil proceeds were better managed. Government policies were more generous and directed at providing for the needs of the people and raising their standard of living. To a greater degree, we had all the government is now trying to provide us as the dividend of democracy. For example, there was a general availability of pipe-borne water in the cities, and unlike now, the water was clean and unquestionably drinkable. The cities were cleaner and their infrastructures better maintained. The supply of electricity was more consistent. The schools, especially, the universities were better funded and equipped. The teachers were motivated and academic standards were higher. Paradoxically, the president then, Yakubu Gowon, was a soldier. Were those the dividend of democracy under a military dictatorship? It can reasonably be argued that freedom of expression is the dividend of democracy. As the saying goes, “the root of bondage is poverty and the root of poverty is ignorance”. Invariably, no one bottled up by the fetters of poverty and ignorance can exercise his right of free speech. It means nothing to a man whose self-confidence, dignity or sense of worth is so totally eroded by poverty and its attendant deprivations and humiliations or to the ignorant that can neither read nor write. Therefore, the foundation for freedom of expression is liberty from poverty and ignorance. But a society does not need democracy to be freed from poverty and ignorance. A benevolent dictator can allows for freedom of speech, even if he chooses to ignore the expressed public opinions. He can also institute liberal economic and social policies that engender general prosperity that improves the lot of even the downtrodden man at the bottom of the economic pyramid, and successfully makes education more accessible to even the very poor. Then, that will be the dividend of democracy from an undemocratic source. So, the dividend of democracy is not freedom of expression (even when it presupposes the absence of general poverty and ignorance). The dividend of democracy is power. Max Weber, the 18th century German sociologist once defined power “as the ability to get others to act in accordance to your will”. Politics is all about power. Unlike tyrannical, dictatorial or oligarchical politics, democratic politics strives for less domination of power by an elite few, and the greater participation of the people in governing themselves. It concerns itself not with mere struggle for power, but an equitable distribution of power. An equitable distribution of power recognizes that the people are the ultimate repository of power, and the elected and government officials and every organ of government are delegated to operate solely and totally in conformity with the will of the people. Nigerians will have the dividend of democracy when this reality becomes the governing principle of Nigerian politics. Presently, there is no dividend of democracy in Nigeria because the elected and government officials remain scornful of the will of the people. For example, through that institutionalized agency of electoral fraud, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), they have stubbornly refused to allow election results to reflect the electoral choices of Nigerian citizens, as expressed through the ballot box. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) political godfathers in their conclaves determine election results which are then imposed on the populace by the INEC. The $16billion earmarked for revamping the energy sector and boosting its power generation capacities was stolen the ruling elite and shared between themselves and their business and political associates. The Railway contract of $8.3 billion reportedly was inflated by of $5.8 billion. Undoubtedly, that excess of $5.8billion is for the pockets of some members of the political class and their cronies. They steal funds budgeted for improving health services in the country, and then, jet set to hospitals in Western countries to treat even minor ailments. Are these and other countless acts of excesses and arrogance, lawlessness and profligacy, greed and corruption, etc of the ruling class not in defiance of the public will?Nigerians will earn the dividend of democracy when the power elite become completely subject to the powers of the electorate, and consequently, act only in accordance to their will. Then, it will be impossible for them to rig elections, steal public funds, or engage in any act that is contrary to the legitimate aspirations of the people. And Nigerian citizens will rise from pawns and stooges in the elite power game to become the focus of the interest, concern and actions of their elected and government officials and every institution of government. And these officials will be reduced from haughty, crooked, selfishness, superciliousness, and money-stealing panjandrums to public servants.”–Tochukwu Ezukanma Andy \nMy dear brothers and Sisters, Pls. stop the verbal attack on yourselves. We are brothers and sisters bound by one nation. We are doing exactly what the Politicians have planned which is divide and rule them forever. Keep them in perpetual bondage, fear and suspicion of each other. Now consider these questions: which one of these politicians is not outrageously rich – Amaechi, Aliyu, Tinubu, baraje, GEJ, Fashola, Obi just name them. They have all become very rich at our own expense. Which one of them does not have several houses overseas, or business investments overseas. They steal us blind and take the money outside the country, thereby creating employment opportunities in those countries while our youths remain jobless and perpetual pawns for their evil manipulations. Wake up Nigerian youths, rise up and take your stand against tribalism, religious intolerance & genocide , corruption and election rigging. Look beyond your ethnic bias and you will see that these people are evil and do not mean well for the nation. Think about it; today Nigeria has a leader whether we voted for him or not – billions of dollars of the countries wealth was sunk in his emergence as president of the country – we have a constitution howbeit faulty that should govern us – it behoves every progressives and peace loving Nigerian to join hands together with the current leadership to squeze whatever contribution he can make towards our nation building and not to distract him the way these so called opposition have been going about it. From day one of his administration – the opposition has instigated violence unabated till date.How can any meaningful development be achieved under this current chaos in our land. For these evil men, it is chop i chop, they dont care about the common man on the street. Their children leave and school abroad in the best environs – the same they wont allow us to have here. Here is my summary – watch and pray, God himself will reveal a leader to us very soon. We must be watchful in order to recognise him or her when revealed. Nigeria’s redemption is certainly not in the hands of PDP or APC. they are birds of the same feather – evil and corrupt politicians. Love yourselves (Hausa, ibo, Yoruba, etc muslim christain etc) I have spoken!!!! Anaedo \nI don’t understand this gov.Ameachi of a guy,after so many years of injustice that people of SS has suffered culminating in the murder of Saro Wiwa,there is now a man(The President) in aso rock who know their pain and have lived their lives,instead of teaming up with the President to solve the problems facing SS and clean their environment polluted by oil companies he(gov.Ameachi) chose a dangerous alliance with APC…I don’t know what you were promised but believe me it will amount to nothing learn from Awolowo mistake in trusting northern elites farooq \nis the president really tackling any of the issues you have raised?………….pollution,intense poverty,joblessness,etc………please,inform……… Anaedo \nMr Farooq been poor they say is a relative term!there is joblessness the world over it is called economic downturn,it is not unique to nigeria under the President,as for pollution wait until the legal processes are exhausted it is not easy to fight a company like shell with a capital bigger than income that nigeria can generate in 10 years from oil export.. farooq \nthe joblessness and poverty in the niger delta is purely man-made,there is no excuse whatsoever for it ..that region should be the norway of nigeria with about $800billion in its savings account and the same level of development ,if not better…………..corruption has decimated it to the extent that the indigents now BEG virtually, to survive!!!! \nnigeria,does not even suffer a “downturn” because it wasn’t “up there” in the first place and why is it not “easy” to fight a company like shell?other countries are ordering them to stop gas flaring and they obeyed at their cost,why is nigeria an exception? because a few people are collecting bribe…………..simple. Anaedo \nWe tend to exaggerate things!I don’t know how you arrived at this figure because I don’t think that from first nigeria oil export till date that we have generated up to $800 billion,but that is beside the point…if you and your governors can generate your own income maybe revive cocoa trade instead of going to abuja to ask for money…then the SS states can keep the resources generated in their region and then can have savings.. farooq \n“don’t think that from first nigeria oil export till date that we have generated up to $800 billion” oh,we have my dear,we have!!! most are unaccountable do your research thru’ opec records,then some extrapolation from recently stolen crude,you would be surprised at what you would come up with,no exaggeration . nomso duke \nThats just simple,this APC guys Tinubu & Co,have been collecting good cash from them. Efe1 \nThere is joblessness and there is no hope joblessness! What we have in the Niger Delta is OYO joblessness (OYO – on your own). GEJ does not have the brain power to deal with the problems of Nigeria, and he has not surrounded himself with people capable either. nomso duke \nWhere were u when SURE P created 21,000 jobs?If GEJ should develop SS u and I will still call him names. Since u have brain u can go in and solve all this unresolved problems like the one ur APC is promising us in their manifesto to give us steady power supply in 1 year,when turbance takes 2-3 years to build. Efe1 \nMy friend yes invisible job or maybe Okada riders. And what is turbance? Andrew \nAmechi received about 2billions dollars between January and October. He has enough to turn Rivers State into Dubai, he does not need any federal presence.Infact Amechi after developing rivers state should still have enough to give to less privileged states (Ebonyi,Zamfara,Taraba etc)as grants (not loans). \nAlso ,I believe you have not visited Etche,this local government does not have any industry, has only 5 filling stations ,does not have a bank and is only 20 km drive from Port Harcourt and yet Amechi has been Speaker for 8 years and Governor for 6 years. Efe1 \nTell us what GEJ has done with 56% of and the revenue generated by the country. You would expect otueke to be mini Dubai by now. I guess they will now have to wait for a Yoruba ibo or Hausa president to do that, because this is the last otueke born president till Jesus Christ returns. Andrew \nJonathan is paying the military,police,customs,immigration,civil defence,civil servants,ASSU and ASUP lectures,national assembly members ,subsidy etc.Also, he will make sure that federal roads are in order.Miltary are well equipped to tackle book haram. \nNow can you tell me what Amechi did with 2 billion dollars within 10 months? Efe1 \nTell me where growth will come from in such a salary paying focused govt. Anybody can pay salary, we did not elect him to pay salary. My friend what you listed are recurrent expenditure, which Ameachi has too. Please list capital project then we can start measuring GEJ success. emeka \nyou are a big fool. Jonathan’s power sector reforms, agric sector reforms alone is enough to make him the best president ever Efe1 \nYour father is a goat and your mother is a fowl! Power sector reform that generate darkness and agric reform that talks about cassava bread that nobody see talk more of eating. Go fcuk yourself Richy Amechi Fidel \nJonathan will make sure that Federal Roads are equipped?? After years in office Jonathan is still trying to make sure instead of fixing the roads. Since Jonathan came in as Nigerian president they have been reports of massive looting, the EFCC is doing nothing because the looters are Jonathan’s associates. ASUU is still on strike just because of Jonathan’s promise and fail agreement. Do what the subsidy thieves??? What about the pension thieves?? They cannot be probed because they are associates of Jonathan. If you have nothing reasonable to comment here then just keep reading other peoples comment. SENSELESS APE The don…… AKA EDO BOY \nby 2015 jonathan would have ruled for 6 years and nothing to show for it and he is desperate for a rerun. so sad nomso duke \nSo sad so good,u can get him out of Aso if u can. nomso duke \nWhen u get their u will do better than GEJ. Efe1 \nHope u read my reply. For you to consider that to be a good question, I am beginning to think you went to school at night. nomso duke \nThats a good question,ask the naughty Efe1 nomso duke \nIf he does develop his state and make it heaven,u will still be the one to talk,just last time an Italian company built a church in his name,the whole Nigeria was divided into 2. Efe1 \nChurch! My guy you see how useless ur GEJ is! What has all the churches we have in Nigeria done for us? The owner just buy private jet on our backs that all. I ask about infrastructure, you are counting churches. Please get out. Adeolu Ayoola Lawrence \nThat is exactly what am saying that all these people are fighting for their own interests and not for Nigerians as a whole. nomso duke \nThis is enough money that if shared to 170m Nigerians each will get something and have change. Its quite unfortunate and yet he is deceiving Riverians that he did it for the interest of his people,which people is he talking about that after receiving this huge nothing to show for it. I weep and weak for our leaders. farooq \nkai,na wa o!!! nomso duke \nU need to start from grass root to get this things right,Past administrations has been using fire bridge approach to do us the more u look u less u see. Biodun Beck \nMy bro,there are lots of things we also don’t understand about your BAD LUCK.After being helped to come to Power by our brave Yorubas,he suddenly turns his back at us.Instead of him to work together with us to solve all the lingering problems in this country,he decided to become ONLY President for the SS/SE. This BAD LUCK should just resign before 2015 or suffer the biggest Political humiliation in the history of Nigerian Politics. Anaedo \nI thought democracy is about consensus not settlement!!!You voted for him to make a difference in SW and he his doing that…Secondly the President is working with yorubas that will work with him after all in his administration are yoruba men even till the posts of ambassador.. nomso duke \nI still the wonder why this guys will not Ibo`s be,u have many Hausa`s and Yorunbas in GEJ administration more than the Ibos yet we are still alive. THEVOICEOFTHEFUTURE \nhow many Yoruba states did PDP win in the last election?it seems you live outside this planet,in my area in Lagos during the last election one loud speaker was blaring besides a polling booth screaming “E MA DI BO FUN AWON OMO IBO,ACN TIWA TIWA NI O” so with those kind of statements and the very well documented penchat of Yoruba ppl to be fickle and devious,which right thinking person will not be wary of an alliance with APC nomso duke \nPls can u explain the meaning for those of us that does not understand ur language. THEVOICEOFTHEFUTURE \n“E MA DI BO FUN AWON OMO IBO,ACN TIWA TIWA NI O” means “DON’T VOTE FOR THESE IBO PPL(referring to GEJ)ACN IS OUR OWN PEOPLE.” akara \nYou forgot to add pollution caused by pipeline thieves and bunkerers.. And also that your GEJ is ready to sell the entire south, for his ambition to remain president after 2015 elections.. DrP-2 \nNigerian politics is very funny…the politicians are fighting for their personnal interest and posturing to be fighting for ethnic and tribal interests , while the people fight themselves over tribal differences and remain under the thrall of the politicians….it is obvious that the G5 or G7 are struggling to transition successfully into Senators and VP or President or kingmakers…but Nigerian voters can only see their tribal differences aye o \nU don’t av sence pls get out from dis forum. Amaechi is making sence. Tell me what he he has done 4 rivers pple. Mumu. DrP-2 \nLOL…just look at the tread above…tribe..tribe.its sickening. when we put all the funds..available agsinst the evidence of what they did on ground..not one including Amaechi can cast any stone against Jonathan considering that the most significant developmental obligations of goverment are at state and LGA levels….the federal govt is not responsible for dirty streets, primary and sec schools, motor parks, markets and all of the everyday things affecting people everyday….but most people are still locked mentally to the era of military rule where they engage in everything. ..the national conference should make this clearer nomso duke \nU are right,every blame is on GEJ while states and LG are collecting their monthly allocation with impacting on their peoples life like Amaechi. Anaedo \nIt is easy for you to blame every different views on tribal differences,but in my opion it more about principle or lack of it. what does the yoruba and north have in common that is worth pursuing nothing!you know why we are where we are today is because the northern elites have found the weakness of yoruba elders and elites,which is just throw them a bone and they will deceive the ordinary trusting yoruba people to be spoilers..me personally I don’t like dogs as a pet,because they don’t have loyalty the follow anybody that feed them. OHWE OREZI \nAnaedo, or whatever you say you are. It is rather the ibos that like playing the second fiddle to the northerners because of their hatred for the yorubas. That is why they are always given the post of a vice-president, instead of president. But for the yorubas, they will rather want to remain in opposition instead of playing a second fiddle.They (the ibos) forget that when it comes to the issue of Nigeria’s No. 1 citizen, the yorubas will rather support a hausa/fulani man instead of an Ibo man. So, it is with the hausa/fulani people. They will rather support a yoruba man to take the position instead of an ibo man. Does this not tell the ibos that there is something that is wrong with them as a people? Why is that majority of Nigerians do not have trust in them? Paul \nNigerians should learn from Switzerland where they have Germans, French, Italians and Romansch. They live together as Swiss people and not as Germans or French or Italians. Switzerland is one of the most people countries on earth. Why can’t Nigerians see themselves as Nigerians and not as Yorubas or Igbos or Hausas or what have you? India have more ethnic groups and languages than Nigeria yet they see themselves first as Indians. There is no day that people here don’t mention tribes in their comments. Are you so narrow minded and that you cannot see beyound your nose? Wake up . This is the issue of Yoruba or Igbo or Hausa. nomso duke \nGod bless u bros,the day we see ourselves as 1 then all this noise making about tribes will end. Ralf \nI,ve bn to Switzerland severally.Italians,Germans and French pple in Switzerland are Christians.They hv common ideology ok.Christians n Muslims cannot hv d same mentality.I dnt think d same way as d boko haram pple. nomso duke \nJust because we are minority like SS too. Beside this is why we can never move forward,tribalism is the order of the day. justus Madu \nOHWE OREZI, can u tell us how many presidents d Yoruba have produced with d hausa/fulani? Remember, OBJ was not a SW candidate in 1999/2003. In fact, d SW was in AD/AC when OBJ emerged president. So, when did d hausa/fulani worked with d SW to produce a yoruba president? U have always aided them to power at d detriment of ur southern bros. Adeolu Ayoola Lawrence \nAnd please Mr. Dog, what does the Igbo or Jonathan and Yoruba has in common? Talk and Talk nothing will happen or-else we go on our paths. Yoruba do not understand Igbo and Yoruba and Igbo do not understand Hausa. We are not ONE NIGERIA. Everyone is fighting for his own pocket and its interests. I am not interested in Tinubu or Jonathan or Buari. I am interested in ordinary markets women struggling to educate their children and ASSU or whatever is on strike base on their own selfish interests also. Think twice and just know that NIGERIA IS ALREADY DIVIDED. Ralf \nThnk you Ade..Nigeria can neva b one. nomso duke \nU should also understand that yorunbas has wise up because APC is one man owned and financed party.ITT Tinubu is trying to play God but by the time he understands what is happening he will lose ownership of APC and states too but for the center over his dead body. oleremond \nPlease do not make disparaging statement against a dog because it is trustworthy, dependable and reliable more than man. If a father calls a child his child so also the child will reciprocate his father . The same is the relationship between a master and a dog. The truth is that Amaechi has lost out politically nomso duke \nGod bless u cos for one day Amaechi have never thought for his people he is only deceiving himself not his people and Nigerians,we are watching as the dreamer and romance with APC unfolds. Anaedo \nAkara, why are you always quick to belief whiteman instead of use your head?now you are talking like you work in the PR department of shell.. These oil companies instead of being socially responsible to their host communities like is done in their countries of origin they took the easy way out and blame their shortcoming/negligence on imaginary oil thieves.. Richy Amechi Fidel \nYou are right, president Jonathan is nothing but a selfish man and he cares less for the south/south people. Bayelsans are suffering from massive oil spill and pollution and the president is from Bayelsa. Andrew \nHave you visted any of the oil spill site in Bayelsa?I have, because my company works there.95% of the oil spill in the Delta region is as a result of pipe line vandalization.Secondly,before you do any repair work in these delta regions ,you pay what is called FTO(freedom to operate).This amount is negotiated between the host community and contractor.The youths are the ones that causing the polution.Majority of the youths in the delta region are lazy ,they think of what to eat today and not what to save for the future. st \ndat is why even d President hast no Paper to his Name, as a phd, and as a lecturer, it is a big shame and laziness. i Wonder what degree they Award at dat uniport. Richy Amechi Fidel \nSir, I am from Delta state and I do business mostly in Bayelsa and Rivers. You cannot tell me about the oil spillage in Bayelsa and let me use this opportunity to educate you more. A recent oil spill from Okordia-Rumuekpe 14-inch crude delivery pipeline has discharged crude into the environment at Ikarama community, Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa. The spill was reportedly caused by activities of oil thieves who left a hacksaw cut on the pipeline. Who are these oil thieves?? Are they invisible? This spillage by the oil operators have caused a slow poisoning of the waters in this region and the destruction of vegetation and agricultural land by oil spills which occur during petroleum operations. But since the inception of the oil industry in Nigeria, more than twenty-five years ago, there has been no concerned and effective effort on the part of the government, let alone the oil operators, to control environmental problems associated with the industry. The Department of Petroleum Resources estimated 1.89 million barrels of petroleum were spilled into the Niger Delta between 1976 and 1996 out of a total of 2.4 million barrels spilled in 4,835 incidents (approximately 220 thousand cubic metres). A UNDP report states that there have been a total of 6,817 oil spills between 1976 and 2001, which account for a loss of three million barrels of oil, of which more than 70% was not recovered. Most of these spills occurred off-shore (69%), a quarter was in swamps and 6% spilled on land. Some spills are caused by sabotage and thieves, however most are due to poor maintenance by oil companies in the region. The common bayelsan life expectancy is coming down. Young men and women are dying in their primes today because of what they eat, polluted substances they collect through the food chains, through their vegetables they eat, snails, fishes and all others. Saro-Wiwa led a nonviolent campaign against environmental degradation of the land and waters of Ogoniland by the operations of the multinational petroleum industry, especially the Royal Dutch Shell company. He was also an outspoken critic of the Nigerian government, which he viewed as reluctant to enforce environmental regulations on the foreign petroleum companies operating in the area. At the peak of his non-violent campaign, Saro-Wiwa died in the process. Susan \nShouldn’t those pipes be underground to make them less accessible to vandals? Is it also true that some of these pipelines run through villages and in some cases people’s back yards? If it is so why and who is to blame? Is this how it’s done in other oil producing countries eg Saudi Arabia, I doubt it very much. So why in Nigeria? Thank you. nomso duke \nTalk to them bros let them understand cos tomorrow they will still blame GEJ for all the wrong and bad things in Nigeria. Matthew keyh \nSince Jonathan became President ,what policy formulation has he got for the Niger delta region ,massive oil spillage ,it even became worse now since the ex-militant are made to secure the region through security contract ,most of the ex-militant are now flying private jet,Amaechi complained that the oil wells that belong to the people of river state are been taken away from them through federal might,and mind you Jonathan is the President from bayelsa state,life is all about principle ,i think i admire Amaechi in the face of intimidation .he took the decision he knows would benefit the people of River state to secure their future and make his people prosperous .jonathan should have resolved the issue amicably ,Tribal jigsaw is the bane of Nigeria as a nation even among the ijaws there is tribalism math ,Inverness UK st \nagree with u. Infact Patience should have used her leverage as a woman to Revolver d issue betw her husband and amechi. Instead she joined d foray. Her own was even More than her husbands. A True woman, as i know d womenfolk, dont behave like that. absolute lack of wisdom. nomso duke \nYes u can call him names but when he goes into action u and I will start crying how bad he is,whether he do good or bad,we most talk. nomso duke \nLet him sell if he can but u forgot to add that Amaechi is the CEO of bunkerers in Nigeria. Efe1 \nAre you sure GEJ knows their pain? I suppose that is why he has embarked on massive developmental work in the Niger Delta and that is why he has cleaned up the years of oil pollution. My friend GEJ does not give a damn! Niger Delta is worse now that before GEJ was elected. I challenge you to name one just one major new infrastructural project initialed and completed by GEJ in the Niger Delta since he became president. Anaedo \nIt is not surprising that the President if what you said is true has not done nothing in river state when the chief officer of the state conspired with men that hold ill will against him..thereby making gov.Ameachi President Joenathan’s ‘brutus’..politically will be incorrect to do something in river state because credit might mistakenly go to the governor..secondly I taught you guys said the President is under the influence of his wife you think his wife will not develop her state..think about it. Efe1 \nYou obviously do not understand democracy. The people of river state according to INEC vote 97.6% for GEJ in the 2011 election. So what do they get for the support shown? If you and your wife are fighting, will you stop feeding your children? Anaedo \nMy friend it is you that don’t understand politics,it all about perception..I might be wrong to assume you reside in Lagos can you mention federal projects in Lagos completed or initiated by this administration it will be difficult,because credit has gone to Fashola..the President and gov.Ameachi problems are beyond fighting don’t you think,gov.has shown is hand by joining apc.. Your analogy is wrong,the president did not stop feeding is children because gov.Ameachi gets the statutory allocation like other states. Efe1 \nMy friend, there are no federal projects initiated and completed to name any where in the country. Fashola is not a thief to claim credit for FG work. Everything in Lagos today under fashola is fashola hand work and initiative. Just name one FG project in PH. And I asked you, if you fight with your wife, will you deprive your children food? peace \nWhen did Awo trust the north?.Perhaps you want to mention Akintola,Tinubu or Abiola. Oluwasegun O \nPolitical parties are just platforms for every politician and you cannot afford to bury your future in a party when you have seen signs that they are ready to close your chapter. \nTo me, Amaechi has made the best decision for HIMSELF because he was long dead in PDP and has no future there. A governor who is not in control of his party in his state because some guys are been backed from the Aso rock to fight against him. Why, they sensed he has an ambition. \nI just look at some guys that always say APC and PDP are the same. Look, in politics you are free to move from Party A to Party B. Every Party in this country are the same as long as it is a Nigerian that is in it. Let’s stop decieving ourseives. Infact, if Nigeria is a party in this world, it will still operate like PDP or APC. \nJonathan has failed me personally. I was blind to support Jonathan during Oil subsidy because of the love i had for him from the time he was our vice president. I believed before he could decide to do that he was sincere man. Now, nothing is coming out of SURE-P. He doesn’t fight corruption at all. I don’t know what I can say is his achievement in office. sunkky \nThe majority of oil pollution is caused by the bunkerers who are mostly ss people, the likes of asari dokubo and co, Jonathan has got nothing to offer…… nomso duke \nHe is just there for his pocket and not in the interest of Rivers at heart as he said. Odenigbo \nAnaedo where did you get these fallacies from? You got it all wrong, you may need to make wider research to get facts about what’s going on in Nigeria under GEJ. GEJ meant well for this country when he assumed power as the president he listed items he planned to achieve, but there’re hawks in the PDP, his wife/office and the presidency that have swallowed up all his objectives as president of Nigeria, these people are busy politically jobbing for confusion and their pockets, please tell me what has GEJ achieved since becoming president? (the south south man will say, we don’t care let him be there, what a stupid ideology) He has not achieved anything but political instability and heated polity. He has spent so much money trying to achieve steady power, but up till now with the PHCN broken up and sold off to politicians steady power has eluded Nigeria, remember he hasn’t built any power plant, the power plants in place were the ones planned and built by the previous governments, it’s a terrible situation to say the list. nomso duke \nWhen people like u ask what has he achieved I just keep mute and tell myself they have come again. We cant continue listing the achievements of this administration but if u think he has not achieved anything yet u should consider and ask why did those administrations that built those power plants as u claimed not give u steady power. jon \nSó even If the president Is corrupt and not living up to Ken sarowiwa we should keep quiet please visit Níger buhari did more us than gej have done in 6 years st \nGEJ didnt Trust northern Elites but he joined PDP? And Those northern Elites plus the Yoruba OBJ Made him president! Idiots link u like to thrive on politics of fear and Division. Please Nigeria is Gone from There. Don Corleone \nAmeachi is now finish politically. For a party in a state he’s a governor to say they’ll go for THANKSGIVING for his exit from the party to the opposition means that Ameachi his politically irrelevant in Rivers state. Politic in Nigeria, is not going to the media to make noise or sell lies like what the APC do, it’s practical. In Anambra, while Peter Obi and his guys where doing grassroots campaign, Ngige was jumping from one media house to another thinking propaganda and lies will help him get votes. Ameachi can now test his popularity in Rivers state. Admiral \nlet’s leave politics of sectionalism and nepostism…..there should be a paradigm shift to generating great ideas and philosophy/policies to improve the lot of Nigerians no matter who they join or where they stay Austin, TO \nI weep for Nigeria. See the tears streaming down my eyes. OMG! \nRotimi! Rotimi!! Rotimi!!! I weep for you. Magic \nRotimi is a millionaire ,think of how u can make it in life akpos1 \n…as it was Iscariot of Judea so shall it be2 to Iscariot of Rivers State. Amen? Amen. \nThe days of aliens governing my Resources are over. While rocks are excavated in Abuja and dredging in Lagos in order to pave way for bridges built with the Niger Delta/SS money, we are told that 2 flyovers in Bayelsa as proposed by Dickson, are ‘White Elephant’ projects. It is the height of insults & the time for the Niger Delta to respond by any means it deems fit, is now. \nIt MUST be said loud & clear, that those who make peaceful change impossible, make violent change inevitable. \n…again we were told by Ken Wiwa that ‘Silence in the face of injustice is treason’. We will not be silent. We urge all revolutionary forces of the Niger Delta to prepare to defend the move to hijack of its resources. \nbless the SS Republic. Albert A \ni agree with you, true son of the land. nemesis will catch up with Amaechi the betrayer. \nJonathan has betrayed Nigerians with an innocent look. Harry \nAmeachi is on the right train, let join him and match into Heaven. APC will surely do better than PDP. The wish of the people is rightly in their agenda. I give my support to APC. Afam \n“I have seen the fact that we are losing our oil wells in Etche, in the Kalabari areas and that the more they continue to pilfer these oil wells, the more we will continue to lose our wealth.” \nAmaeechi the spirit of Ken saro Wiwa will hurt you till end..So for 38 years Hausa/Fulani ruled this country what have they done to your region before you became Governor? I wish you well in APC if they will give you chance to do what you did in PDP…. mathew \nOne by one Amaech is coming out with the reason why he hated president. But the question is what achievement he achieve before losing it. Because they block one of his looting point he started to cry. Am expecting a leader to be able to encourage his followers on way forward rather than losing hope on small thing. When there is life there is hope. I see Amaech point here as cheap to win a flexible mind of River state person. Abdul \nsmall boy, who build pht refinery, warri refinery, and fertilizer company of pht? is these not the ppl you are abusing northerners who done that, check who built pht airport northerners, IBB build asaba airport, and warri. tell me one project initiated and completed by present administration in Niger delta. farooq \neverything is for my “people” .only the people neva chop .. mathew \nlaugh…….. boy your brain is working like computer. Albert A \nAmaechi is only the Judas Iscariot that the muslim Yorubas and Hausa/fulani could find to betray the president and his south-south people. he is only fighting for himself and position (vp) not the people of rivers. Oluwasegun O \nBros, this is not an issue of christian and muslim. How many christians do we have in this world? Don’t use that as a vote bag. Nigeria needs a president indeed. Someone that can truely serve the Nation. Hausa,Yoruba, Igbo or whoever. Am tired of a country that stays at a point and moves backward every month. Only If Jonathan can start fighting corruption. mathew \nI will like to say that this Ameach statement is meanly for Rivers people to react. Also, I will like to commend Gov. Rotimi Ameachi for your brave and courage to pull out from PDP. But I will like to let him know that if your motive of pulling out has anything to do with personal agenda the interpretation will be that you are betrayer. And a betrayer will not go score free. Judas in the bible is an example common for you to understand. Sometimes ago in this forum I advise you that people that praise you today will deny you tomorrow. What you sow is what you reap. no 2 way about that. We are watching. Gold \nAmaechi is always sounding like a broken record. After running his mouth on GEJ led FG, he is claiming there is no problem with him and GEJ and that he respects the president. If he does, he should have gone to meet him one-on-one when these crisis started, but for his over bloated ego and arrogance, he felt otherwise. Is not a shame that under his leadership in the state, house of assembly went comatose, crisis here and there. Thats simply FAILURE of leadership! Amaechi has proven that he can not lead! Leadership is not by gra-gra. He kept talking about oil wells. Which oil well? the issue of oil wells dates back to 2000, long time before GEJ became president. Did Rivers state not get some oil well from other states? Amaechi should breath and stop his youthful exuberance! Sometimes youth mess up and misbehave in politics. Politics should be played with maturity. Thats is what Aliyu and Lamido, who pushed Amaechi into fast lane of destruction is now exhibiting by opting out (unknown to Amaechi and co) of the so called declaration to join APC. Amaechi has been fore warned about romance with Northerners to fight his own brother, he would not listen. A dog that will be lost, will not hear the beacon of the hunter! Baguda \nSomebody should advice amechi,Abiola is a very good example, this people will use you against your own people, they will make you rich and famouse at last they will kill you, Awo tried in vain to advice him,but it fail on deaf ears, maye they have promised him one thing or the other, but i smell betrayal. mathew \nYou are very correct but don’t think Aliyu and Lamido misled him. I can tell you that Amaech is the chief architect of rebellion act. We shouldn’t deceive ourself all of them were mutual enough to know what is right and what is wrong but because of selfish interest they ignored valuable advise and elderly advise from their region. Hope Chambers \nGreat Ojukwu our late Ikemba saw all these coming and started his crusade of separation but some of our brothers in the south south and the whole south west said NO and Biafra was lost. I will like to say GOOD MORNING to those South South and south westerners who now seem to realize that Nigeria as so configured can never be one Just like the ikemba said to Saro wiwa when he started his Ogoni land oil crusade. Bad Blood \nAmaechi amaechi amaechi how timne did i called u? \nBy the time they will chase you out of the land and ocean..please don’t come to the tree barbecue i wont contain you to avoid rebel on my kingdom. \nA beg give me some Banana jo \nHaters gonna hate elochris \nNuissance i pity rivers as a whole cos u might bring calamity just like osun state governor,can someone brings out of clean things out of unclean things? Jungle Justice \nAmechi ur nw a complete politician declear urslf lik dt is gud dan to b fighting evru day i wish u d best LONDON BOY \nWhy he didn’t join whatever for his first 4 years in the office why now he have finished his 8 years and he open your big mouth and saying is for good of rivers….God will judge you Zebby \nyou joined APC to further your (selfish) political interests. what have you done for Rivers people in 8 years you have been in power and with all the hundreds of billions of naira you have received in revenue. AJ Toronto \nI will vote for APC in 2015 if i have the opportunity to be in Nigeria. APC is good or bad, worst or better than PDP i don’t care. ALL I WANT IS CHANGE. Tired of PDP way of ruling. Time to try another party to see what they’ve got. Andy \nSo you have been won over by APC already And do you think APC will be able to make any progress if PDP creates the kind of crisis that was created for GEJ today.For example, what if the Niger delta crisis or Masob crisis is awakened by the opposition if APC wins election – how will they cope. You see my brother, all of us must join hands to say no to politics of bitterness and tribal sentiments. kraziebone \nYOU JOIN FOR YOUR POCKET. RUBBUISH Mani_Kay \nAMAECHI’S BIG INSULT \nAMAECHI DESERVES A DIRTY SLAP AND A KICK IN THE GROIN FOR INSULTING THE PEOPLE OF RIVERS STATE. \nIt is a very big and unpardonable insult on the people of Rivers State for Governor Rotten Amaechi to say that he joined APC in order to protect the interests of Rivers people especially on oil revenue related matters. \nHow on earth can Governor Rotten Amaechi say this ……. is he mad, is he drunk, is he brainless? \nThe leader of APC General Muhammadu Buhari who also doubles as APC’s certain Presidential Candidate for 2015 is a man that does not hide his disdain for the derivation principle in Nigeria’s revenue allocation. \nIn fact, Buhari firmly believes that the derivation principle in revenue allocation is nothing but a crime against the born-to-rule Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani and if he has his way it would be completely abolished. \nRecall that in 1984 Buhari reduced derivation from 5% to 1.5%. \nIt is instructive to note that Buhari did this despite mounting pressure from well meaning Nigerians calling for an increase in the derivation fund. \nInstead of an increase that notable Nigerians were yearning for, Buhari single handedly and unilaterally reduced the derivation fund from a meager 5% to a miserable 1.5%. \nBuhari is a key player in APC and a big threat to the derivation principle in revenue allocation. \nIt is therefore an obvious insult for anyone to say that the interests of Rivers people will be better served by Buhari’s APC. \nIs it not the huge amounts of money accruing to Rivers State from the present 13% derivation fund that Governor Rotten Amaechi is wasting on private jets and funding of frivolous political activities in the country? Ades \nPDP man, sorry o pure heart \nAmechi is like a weed among the G7 govs, he should know that there is always a ”meeting after meeting”, and gov Amechi will not be there wtih them and can not be there with them in that meeting… a word is enough for a wise Andrew \nYesterday in PH, thousands of able bodied youths came out to jubilate the exit of Amechi.These are youths who should have been gainfully employed. If Amechi was a serious person,he ought to have brought companies to Rivers State or create employment opportunities for these jobless youths, but instead he goes about castigating the Jonathan and making noise here and there. \nHe receives close to 2 billion dollars within 10 months, this amount is more than the budget of Benin Republic.Amechi does not pay the police or military, the Benin republic government does this and yet Amechi is telling us that he has built school and hospitals and he still needs federal presence. Imagine! does he not know that he is federal government himself?.Amechi should be ashamed of himself. \nIn Anambra where I am from it is not possible for you have a rally within 24 hours and you have youths of such magnitude. People are gainfully employed or going about their normal businesses. That is the reason why APC is unable to gather crowds for demonstration instead they import jobless non-indigenes or go to Abuja to demonstrate.Amechi should take a q from a working governor like Peter Obi ,who not only developed his state with the little money from the federal government but is also able to make the state investors friendly and provide employment opportunities for his people. \nStop been Naive. You have to call on Jona to fight unemployement in Nigeria. ASU is on strike for almost five months. Tell Jonathan to give amaechi a free hand to operate in the state where he has been elected. mo Mody \nWhat happened to Amaechi’s Greater Port Harcourt project? Does he need Jonathan to execute that? Ossai Ossai E N \npersonal survival or group survival? What I see in the Amaechi down town journey is simply personal political survival. He has however behaved like any other Nigerian politician in trying to input group interest to the whole drama. We will see the end of it all Sheriff \nNigeria politics is beginning to get interest. Gov Ameachi should please let us know his hidden agenda and to Gov. Aliyu, PDP should be careful because he want to be use to break the party. Though I don’t like PDP at all, but despite that fact the only man who can do the job Gov Aliyu intend doing is Oyinlola, but anyway please let us have a change of ruling party to see which one is good for my country!!! Please let us know Atiku intention also because that man is like the green snake under the green grass. He can do and undo. Atiku is a master rigger I submit Obi \nYou joined APC to protect Rivers people or to protect your pocket and interest? Only time will tell Asonye Chidozie \nAmaechi joined APC for the interest of his family and himself, he should not link his problem with the president to oil wells in Rivers state. amadi uche \nTHERE ARE MANY DEVICES IN THE HEART OF A MAN NEVERTHELESS THE COUNCIL OF GOD THAT WILL STAND. ONYI-APRETIA \nYes, Ameachi is at it again. You know a man by the battle he fights. He claims Rivers State suffers neglect under GEJ but his state collects the 2nd highest allocation from both the Excess Crude Account and the Federation Account. The East-West road is fast approaching completion in the Rivers State axis, yet this state is suffering neglect according to the gospel of Ameachi. But as a Niger Deltan, one is forced to ask what Ameachi has done in all these years in office to advance the course of the Delta. Nigerians can’t forget in a hurry the vigor and energy that Ameachi has invested in trying to truncated the only tenure of presidency held by a Niger Deltan, yet when it comes to issues of mutual benefit to Niger Deltans such as the PIB bill, same vocal Ameachi is quiet while his close political friends vehemently speak out in opposition of the PIB, like the stand taken by Babangida Aliyu of Niger State. Even so, it’s on record that Ameachi in this administration has publicly called for the sack of three Niger Deltans holding ministerial positions- Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Orubebe and Nyesom Wike. He has severally launch attacks on Deziani Allison Madueke, yet this is a man who claims to protect Rivers State’s interest. May be, to Ameachi, protecting Rivers State, means the subjugation and humiliation of the rest of the Niger Delta. Ameachi has forgotten so quickly, that Rivers State is what it is today because of the patriotic disposition of fellow Niger Deltans who paid the ultimate prize at one point in time or the other, such as Melford Okilo, Diete Spiff, Isaac Adaka Boro etc. The world is watching, and the rest of the Niger Delta is watching; the people of Rivers State can not be fooled by the selfishness and self aggrandizement that characterizes Ameachi’s political antics. Today Amaechi has joined the bitter, paranoid and ethnically biased opposition to ask GEJ to start writing a handover note even before his tenure elapse, and the reason he seeks to sell to his gullible and pliable supporters is that Rivers oil wells are being taken; in the past he told his followers he was being witch haunted politically because of his forthright stand on national issues his story is a complex unfolding odyssey, woven with so many transparent lies which he seeks to use as dark lining covering his covetousness, politics of hate, selfishness and his inflated sense of pride. Ken \nThis sounds like a sponsored post. doooyeaa \nwill you remain a member of APC for long? before long you will come back to PDP, we don’t have opposition in Nigeria, only my interest when it suits me most…..Association of Politically Confused-Nigerians(APC)…may have nothing to offer you so be wise Amaechi. Fidel98 \nYou did not join APC in other to protect the Rivers people but to protect your political ambition Q.E.D . Stop deceiving yourself for the River state people are not fools as may be thinking. Just give all these people little time after election and their party fails all of them will still go back to PDP and that time they will still say that they are protecting their people that the APC is not good. These are all political prostitutes and nothing else. Johnpaul \n@Anaedo you must be too selfish to think only about ss interest instead of Nigeria in general. metucellar \nthe problem of amechi is that he believed he is far better than GEJ that is why he is filling too big to listing to his people,this man should just go and bury his face in shame .when he was denied the governorship ticket in rivers state by OBJ ,the people he is fighting against fought tooth and nail to make sure justice prevail and he became gorvernor but he went to their back and stabbed them not knowing that the people that denied him of that ticket knows amechi more than he knows himself, but my people say that when the ear refuses to listing when the head is cut off the ears goes along with it. MOSOX \ntank God AMAECHI hs finally left. PDP will now move 4ward. he ws an obstacle. John \nThe defection is a watershed in our democratic journey and hope rekindled. The beneficiaries are Nigerians. Our democratic institutions will be strengthened by implication. Never again will the people be taken for granted. I congratulate these men of courage.” THEVOICEOFTHEFUTURE \nI am very surprised at the defection of Amaechi to APC, after which he comes out and says he is doing it for the good of Rivers people,thats a blatant lie,everyone knows it is for his own selfish ambitions, You AmaechI I’m sorry to say are not a good student of history and therefore a comical politician at best, and a suicidal one at that, it is no secret that you are fighting the president because you see him as a SS man and his being at the centre will block your way to being there, but is going to APC your best bet? NO is the answer because (1)APC will never give you their presidential ticket not with this your hastily arranged defection and certainly not with the characters already in the APC.(2) In the unlikely situation that you do get the ticket even as VP, will you win? that’s another NO, because no Yoruba or Hausa man will vote for you because of the well documented prejudice these ppl have against any easterners, only GEJ has ever won the presidential seat with out the backing of any of this 2 tribes that form part of the main triangle this nation was formed with, but now we have seen in GEJ, the emergence of the minority ppls of the north and south coming together to oppose these egocentric ppl, and YES they are all solidly behind GEJ. Now Rotimi you have become a Lame duck governor in your own state, and also the most despised governor in Nigeria, and a big political liability to APC.(3) If you were wise you’ll take the case of NGIGE as a pointer to the feelings of the ordinary people of Nigeria,NGIGE is definitely the best and most popular of the governorship candidates but he lost, not because of rigging or ineptitude by INEC but because the ppl are wise now,they know that APC which is also an amalgamation with Buhari’s CPC can never be trusted ,they have a very sinister ulterior motive,as shown by their very aggressive inorganic growth and desperation, I sense OSHIOMOLE has seen it to and is trying to wriggle his way free of their grip. If you were wise YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE POINT I ITEMISED AND GUARD AGAINST IT, sorry for you,I FEEL ESPECIALLY SORRY FOR ROCHAS OKOROCHA BECAUSE HE WILL LOOSE THE NEXT ELECTION IN IMO STATE,HE WILL ALSO FIGHT YOU FOR THAT VP SLOT YOU SO MUCH CRAVE FOR,THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU TWO SHALL BE CONSIGNED TO POLITICAL DUSTBIN,SHAME ON YOU TRAITOR DEM GO BEAT YOU FOR PORT HARCOURT WHEN YOU COMOT GOVT HOUSE. jon \nBuhari or apc will be next predident you wait and the real King makers have chosen ibb obj dantatas and ezehs nzeribes and most importantly brits russians germans americans french they have fallen out wit gej cause He cant control nigeria and his wife cause If we have turmoil in nigeria these countrys will loose billions in revenue THEVOICEOFTHEFUTURE \nO how the mighty are fallen,In the Bible it took a humble and effeminate David to bring down the mighty and loquacious Goliath,that is exactly what has happened with GEJ,but reading thru your comment it seems you are not very politically sagacious if not you won’t mention IBB,NZERIBE concern \nPoint of correction, if there was anybody who made a mistake of trusting core north it was zik not awo .Politically, zik aligned with balewa while awo had administrative relations with gowon who he is not a core northerner. THEVOICEOFTHEFUTURE \nYou are right on this, if Zik had not compromised in 1957 when the north said they would rather secede than become independent we won’t have these problems today, we would have been giving them loans and grants and their children would have been coming here to school and get enlightened, we would have been a middle power like south Korea and Singapore, instead we are bogged down by religious matters and laziness.
