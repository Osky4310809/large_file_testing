Rick is back in action and in search of allies to help him take down the Saviors.\nWhile you were reveling at being reunited with Rick and the gang as they bounced from one camp to another to assemble an army against Negan, you may have missed a few key moments and references the episode alluded to hinting at potential larger problems to come.\nKeep reading to see the details you may have missed.\n How closely were you watching this scene when Gabriel drove away from Alexandria in the episode's opening minutes? AMC At first glance, it may have looked like he turned on Rick and the gang and took off, but that may not be the case.\nAnother person revealed themselves to be on the passenger side of the vehicle as Gabriel drove away. Who is that!? AMC Who is the mystery man (or woman) ? Did they force Gabriel to purge Alexandria of its goods? Perhaps it's the same mysterious person we saw skulking around the camp in the mid-season finale or someone from the group Rick just ran into at the episode's end. Maybe they're both connected. Hopefully, the next episode brings more answers.\nAfter Gregory turns Rick away, a woman named Bertie and some other Hilltop members tell Maggie they want to fight with them against Negan. AMC We've seen Bertie before.\nRick and Michonne saved Bertie and a friend back in season six. AMC In season six, episode 11, Rick's crew saved several people from a building overrun with several zombies.\nMorgan tells Rick and Daryl he killed a Savior to protect Carol. AMC He came to Carol's defense in the season six finale.\nThat's huge because it means Morgan broke his no-killing rule. AMC In season six, episode four we learned more about where Morgan had been before he caught back up with Rick.\nHe was trained by a man named Eastman to adopt the idea that \"all life is precious.\" He carried a book on him called \"The Art of Peace,\" which he recently bestowed to Benjamin at the Kingdom. In it, is a handwritten inscription that says \"Akido means not to kill ... we try to completely avoid killing, even the most evil person.\"\nMorgan also told Rick and Daryl he had no idea where Carol currently was even though he's perfectly aware of her location. AMC This was a bit painful because Daryl looked especially upset after being kidnapped by the Saviors.\nWhy would Morgan lie to his friends? Well, he seems to believe he's protecting Carol.\nCarol asked to be left alone and it appears Morgan is respecting those wishes. Gene Page/AMC Morgan knows Rick wants to gather people together to fight Negan and Carol made it clear to Richard and Morgan she has no interest in getting involved.\nStill, given how far back Rick and Morgan go, it's a bit weird for him to lie to Rick's face. Doesn't Morgan think Rick will eventually find out where Carol is?\nEzekiel tells a bedtime story to Benjamin's brother. AMC We hear the last few snippets of it:\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\nHe's quoting the end of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. Gene Page/AMC The speech has parallels to the current situation both Ekeziel's group in the Kingdom and Rick's group in Alexandria face against the Saviors. They are not free right now, living in fear of them. One day, perhaps if they all gather together, they can break free of their rule.\nWhen Rick and the crew come across a blocked road they think the Saviors are trying to make it tough to get to them, but they're wrong. AMC When Rick's son Carl sees the Saviors' home in the distance, the group figures this blockade is similar to the ones they've faced in the past from the Saviors. That's not the case.\nThe blockade and dynamite were to fend off a herd of walkers. Rick's group taking the TNT may be helpful against Negan's group, but it may cause a bigger problem. Gene Page/AMC What Rick doesn't realize is that one of Negan's men, Joey, was in charge of redirecting large groups of walkers from harming other communities like the Kingdom and Rick's home of Alexandria. Joey and a team of people set up that TNT to get rid of walkers, not to harm other people.\nThe other thing that Rick doesn't realize is that Joey is dead. Daryl brutally beat him to death in the mid-season finale. Now, with no one to redirect the undead, large groups of zombies may become an issue in the future.\nAfter they successfully retrieve the dynamite, Rick questions putting the lives of his friends and family in danger. AMC Rick ponders whether gathering the dynamite was worth risking the remaining lives of his group when there was a giant zombie herd approaching.\nMichonne reassures him it was the right thing saying that they're the ones who live. AMC Again, Michonne is reminding Rick of a speech he once told his group back when they first arrived at the Alexandria community .\nIn December's mid-season finale, she told Rick that their group gets things done.\n\"You said that. We're the ones who live. That's why we have to fight,\" she said to Rick. \"For Judith. For Carl. For Alexandria. For the Hilltop. For all of us. We can fight them, Rick. We can find a way to beat them. We can do this, but only if we do this.\"\nRead the original article on INSIDER . Follow INSIDER on Facebook . Copyright 2017.
