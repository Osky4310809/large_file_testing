Maybe even Commonwealth Games. \n“I cannot say how excited we all are.” \nMr Ashworth told the ECHO: “We're in quite healthy talks with Everton at the moment, so it's not finalised yet. But as Peel and as myself I would love to see a stadium on the waterfront. \n“To have this as the anchor at one end of the waterfront, and then you go all the way down towards the ECHO arena... the waterfront would be a visual spectacle. Everton are set to have a new state-of-the-art ground (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \n“So we're pushing forward with it, the council are helping, and I think we'll get to a conclusion. A good one. Hopefully in the near future.” \nHeads of terms is an initial agreement ahead of signing a full contract. \nPeel's other plans for the northern docks, including floating buildings, will be changed if the stadium happens. Goodison Park has been the home for Everton for over 120 years (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nHe said: “At the northern docks, Bramley-Moore Dock and Nelson Dock, we have two options. \n“One is to develop it out with several developers for residential and put floating buildings in the docks themselves. And the floating buildings would be doctors' surgeries, workshops, bars, restaurants. \n“And obviously Everton stadium is another. “ poll loading Should Everton leave Goodison Park? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T18:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T16:23:50.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
