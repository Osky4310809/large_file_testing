Bleacher Report's Mike Tanier thinks Alualu will be a good fit in Pittsburgh: Mike Tanier ðŸ“Ž @MikeTanier 3/21/2017, 4:25:30 PM Alualu, 29, spent his first seven seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars . He recorded 37 tackles and 2.5 sacks in 14 games, though his performance was inconsistent, a common occurrence for the former first-round pick. The Jaguars made him a healthy inactive early in the season, ending a streak of 96 straight games played. Alualu wound up recovering and playing in 14 games, starting 10, but the likelihood of a return always felt a little slim. Jacksonville moved on from head coach Gus Bradley and hired Doug Marrone, who had been with the franchise since 2015. While it was not the same as hiring an entirely new coaching staff, Bradley's stamp was all over the Jaguars defense in recent seasons. The Steelers likely will look at Alualu for depth. Pro Football Focus ranked him 74th among interior linemen last season, not exactly a great sign that he's readying a breakout in the second half of his career. It's likely he'll fill in as a rotation player next season.
