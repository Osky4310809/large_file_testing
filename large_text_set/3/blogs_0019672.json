Well, CNN does, apparently. \nFor those who are curious as to why this is even a discussion, it’s all because of a conspiracy theory that says the president held the hand of British Prime Minister Theresa May when she visited the White House because of his alleged stairs phobia. \nBut there’s no concrete evidence the president is afraid of stairs — much like there’s no actual evidence Obama ever wiretapped Trump. PM Thersea May holds President Trump's hand outside White House To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nMay recently addressed these rumors in an interview with Vogue . \nShe said, \nI think he was actually being a gentleman. \nWe were about to walk down a ramp, and he said it might be a bit awkward. \nThe real news here is that a woman actually called Trump a gentleman. Sounds like alternative facts, if you ask me. To be fair, stairs can definitely be dangerous. I wish my son were afraid of stairs. pic.twitter.com/3shd6Dqq2e \n— Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) March 22, 2017 But this is exactly why people don’t like the media right now. \"Why do people hate the media?\" \nCNN: \"Allow me to demonstrate.\" pic.twitter.com/fxbznXUgOx \n— Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) March 22, 2017 Uhhhh. @CNN is talking about how Trump may have a fear of stairs…? Are you joking me…? And people wonder why the media gets tuned out \n— Brown Sugah (@SexyRexy8Lover) March 22, 2017 If @CNN wants to stop being called \"fake news\" by the Trump Admin, they should probably go with real news stories..not Trump v Stairs‍♀️ \n— Caroline Craig (@CeeJayCraig) March 22, 2017 \nThere are so many things we could discuss about Trump, and many valid things to criticize about him — things that have nothing to do with stairs. \nMaybe he’s afraid of stairs, but his apparent fear of Muslims , refugees and people of color is way more concerning. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
