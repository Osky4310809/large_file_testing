The latest forecast guidance is suggesting a track favorable for widespread accumulating snow, with the heaviest amounts from eastern Pennsylvania and the New York City Tri-State area into southern New England. \nHere's the timeline and how much snow could fall. \nWednesday Night Snow spreads from the Ohio Valley and Appalachians into the Northeast. The line separating rain from snow is still uncertain, making the forecast for the transition from rain to snow difficult from far southeast Pennsylvania to Maryland, the Delmarva Peninsula and northern Virginia. At least some snow is most likely overnight north of Interstate 95, from north of Philadelphia to southern New England, including the New York City Tri-State area. Wednesday Night's Forecast, Credit: TWC \nThursday Snow may linger along the mid-Atlantic coast at least through the morning. Farther north, snow could be heavy at times from eastern Pennsylvania and the New York City Tri-State area into New England. Gusty winds will also be on the increase across parts of the Northeast. Thursday's Forecast, Credit: TWC \nHow Much Snow? In general, moderate to locally heavy accumulations of a half-foot or more are possible from eastern Pennsylvania and the New York City Tri-State area into New England. Locally higher snowfall rates could lead to greater amounts in some areas, particularly in southern New England, where up to a foot of snow is not out of the question. Lighter amounts are forecast farther south into the mid-Atlantic region, though some higher terrain locations in the central Appalachians could also see higher totals. The snow will lead to a tricky Thursday morning commute for at least part of the Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington D.C. corridor. Flight delays are likely. The Thursday evening commute may be challenging in southeastern New England, including the Boston and Providence metro areas. Some blowing and drifting snow is possible Thursday in southeastern New England if the offshore low strengthens appreciably. \nSee winter weather from this season 42 PHOTOS See Gallery Winter weather 2016-2017 \nDogs walk through the snow during a spring snow storm in Boston, Massachusetts April 4, 2016. \n(REUTERS/Brian Snyder) \nPeople walk through Times Square during a snow storm on January 7, 2017 in New York City. \n(Photo by Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) \nA man sweeps the street after snow fell in Manhattan, New York City, U.S. December 17, 2016. \n(REUTERS/Kevin Coombs) \nSemi-truck driver Don Kerns removes chains from his truck during record rain and snow outside Lakeview, Oregon, U.S., January 5, 2017. \n(REUTERS/Jim Urquhart) \nA snowman stands in Times Square following a morning snow in Manhattan, New York City, U.S. December 17, 2016. \n(REUTERS/Andrew Kelly) \nA man skis under a snowfall in Central Park during a winter storm on January 7, 2017 in New York. \n(EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP/Getty Images) \nA general view of snow covered seats at New Era Field before a game between the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers. \n(Timothy T.
