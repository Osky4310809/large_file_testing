Too often people don’t think of golf as a sport, which it certainly is. So I’d encourage people to get out there and have fun playing golf, because it’s clearly good for you.\" Read more on: sunshine tour | golf NEXT ON SPORT24 X", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:12:29.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
