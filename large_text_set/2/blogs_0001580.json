The Ontario MP called President Donald Trump’s message exciting, and her campaign has advertised on U.S.-based right-wing sites such as Breitbart to try capturing a Canadian contingent of voters interested in Trump-like policies.\nIt’s all part of a sophisticated strategy that Kouvalis seemed confident would put Leitch within spitting distance of Conservative Party leadership.\nShe remains a serious contender and is in second place on the fundraising front as of the fourth quarter of 2016, with only Quebec MP Maxime Bernier raising more money.\nKouvalis called it a privilege to work for Leitch. It wasn’t immediately clear who would be taking over operations for her campaign.\nLeitch debates the 13 other leadership candidates in Halifax on Saturday. Conservatives will elect a leader May 27.\n• Email: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: amariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:37:04.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
