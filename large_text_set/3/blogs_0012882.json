It has happened to Deepika Padukone, Sushmita Sen, Katrina Kaif, Sonakshi Sinha, and many others, demonstrating that men seem to think that women are just up for grabs (quite literally). \nRecently, another such incident took place at the Kolkata airport, where Balan was visiting to promote her upcoming film, Begum Jaan . It was there that a fan approached her for a selfie, and she, known for her approachability, agreed. But, this man crossed a line by putting his arm around her without her consent. What's worst is that he refused to back down even after being told to. Vidya Balan's manager had to intervene to prevent the situation from getting completely out of hand. \nEven then, the man asked for a picture one more time. Vidya agreed. He once again tried to put his arm around her, and that's when she lashed out at him, and told him that he can't get a picture with her. Enough for him to back off, right? But, no. He continued to follow her, asking her for a picture. \nLater, she gave this statement to Spotbye , \"When a stranger puts an arm around you, be it a man or a woman, you get uncomfortable because they are intruding into your personal space. We are public figures, not public property.\" Picture Credits: Dailypicsupdate", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T02:46:13.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
