Or perhaps I should say that I sat down to write one story, but ended up writing two. \nI spent the past week interviewing women participating in the post-inauguration women's marches in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. Their stories are compelling in their own right, but together their lives tell an underlying story so woven into the fabric of American life that we can't see it unless we stop to look. So let's look. \nTo do that, we have to dial the clock way back and visit 1776 to hear Abigail Adams ask her husband, in vain, for our nation to \"remember the ladies.\" We have to go to Seneca Falls and hear women argue for the right to keep wages earned by their own labor, then we have to wrap around minds around the fact that only one woman who signed the Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments in 1838, Charlotte Woodward, was alive when American women gained the vote in 1920. (She herself was almost certainly too ill to vote.) We have to acknowledge that 240 years passed before a woman had a realistic chance to lead this country. The fight for equal rights has been long. Millions of women are taking to the streets to say that it isn't over. \nThe lives of the women I interviewed stand in vibrant contrast to history. They received educations unimaginable to Abigail Adams. They lead law firms and think tanks. They do things like perform at Carnegie Hall. They educate. They work for the wellbeing of people who don't have much. The women at Seneca Falls would have been so proud. \nThese women are alike in just one way. They were all born during a time of struggle for women's rights. They've led lives that were inconceivable when they were born in the 1960s and 1970s, which we should all remember was not that long ago. \nI'll let them speak about the marches in their own words. Then, I'll let their accomplishments tell the second story, which is this: It's hard to overemphasize how recently women gained rights that are now taken for granted. \nThese women are at the height of their careers. Society will benefit from their contributions for years to come. Without the work of the women who went before them, we would have missed out on so much. Barbara Gault \nBarbara Gault, PhD \nIt's important for women to come together to send a strong message that we expect continued progress on issues like equal pay and paid leave, we will defend reproductive rights and protect our safety net, and we demand that leaders treat women with respect and common decency. We also need to strategize on new ways to organize and advocate in light of intensifying divisions in how Americans get information and connect with one another. There is a sense of fear and outrage, and an urgent need to marshal our power as citizens and activists in creative ways to face and address formidable challenges. \n_Barbara Gault is Vice President and Executive Director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research. She holds a Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. Gault serves on the Board of Directors of the Coalition on Human Needs and is a Research Professor of Women's Studies at the George Washington University. She has spoken at venues nationwide, including to Congress and at the White House. _ \nShe was born eight years before the US Supreme Court ruled on Reed v. Reed , the first time a state law treating women differently from men was struck down. Tonya Wood \nTonya Wood, PhD \nAs soon as I heard about the march, I went ahead and got a hotel room before the details were even worked out. I just felt an overwhelming feeling to do something. There was this feeling of, okay, there's work to be done. It was an awakening: We are still fighting for civil rights. I've always asked myself if I had been around in the sixties, what would I have done? It's now my turn and my time to be the one marching. \nTonya Wood Huey has a PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Virginia. She has worked in community mental health with low-income underserved communities and in private practice, and she teaches at Pepperdine University. \nAn African-American, she was born in Georgia in 1970, two years before Barbara Jordan became the first African-American woman elected to Congress from a former Confederate state. \nJodi Schwartz, JD, MBA, LLM \nI'm marching so that the incoming administration and the Republican Congress will see that many Americans care about the rights of women, immigrants, and minorities, and that we won't be silenced. The majority of people voted for Hillary Clinton and the majority of people who voted are in support of her issues. I think that message needs to be repeated and repeated, particularly for this administration, which hasn't proven itself yet to be sensitive to these issues. I'm going with my fourteen-year-old daughter. To share that experience with her, I think, will be wonderful. \nJodi Schwartz, a partner in a New York law firm, is one of the world's leading lawyers in the field of taxation . She holds a Juris Doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, an MBA from The Wharton School, and an LL.M. in taxation from NYU Law School. \nShe was born in 1960, fifteen years before the Supreme Court ruled on Taylor v. Louisiana , denying states the right to exclude women from juries . Lisa Pratt \nLisa Pratt, MBA \nI grew up in a house where my mother had a career in computer science and my parents split family responsibilities equally, so I always believed that gender equality was the norm. I now understand that my experience is far from the norm and I want to be part of changing that. \n_Lisa is Senior Director in Marketing at Kronos, a high tech company that provides workforce management solutions. She holds a BA from the University of Vermont, a master's degree in economics from the University of Rhode Island, and an MBA from Syracuse University. _ \nLisa was born in 1966, five years before the Supreme Court ruled in Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corporation , that employers could not refuse, outside of business necessity, to hire women with pre-school children while hiring men with such children. Maryl Soto-Schwartz \nMeryl Soto-Schwartz, PhD \nI've identified as a feminist since I was eleven. I came of age as abortion became legal. I've never personally needed to avail myself of abortion rights--I am a lesbian--but it's important to me that all women have reproductive rights. Separation of church and state is important to me. Gay rights are important. As a Jew, I am distressed by the anti-Semitism that has erupted in the aftermath of the election. I'm an anti-racist activist, as well. I'm marching for all of our identities to be respected and for all of our civil rights. I'm marching as a woman, a feminist, a Jew, and a lesbian. The sign I carry will say \"Not Going Back.\" \nMeryl Soto-Schwartz holds a PhD in English Literature from the University of Wisconsin. She is a full professor at Lakeland Community College. \nShe was born in 1961, fifty-four years before legal same-sex marriage. She and her wife Melissa Soto-Schwartz were married in Ohio by a rabbi in 1997. In 2000, they were joined in a civil union in Vermont. In 2011, they were married in New York, when same-sex marriage became legal there. In 2015, same-sex marriage became the law of the land and their marriage was recognized in their home state of Ohio. Elena Hammel \nElena Hammel, MM \nI'm marching because I have this sense of not wanting to repeat the silence that followed the election of Hitler. We need to be as noisy as possible in our protest and opposition to Trump and his unethical policies, impending attacks on civil liberties, and corruption of separation between public and private interests. I'm taking my 10-year-old daughter Siena because she needs to learn these lessons young. It will be good for both of us to be surrounded by brave, dedicated activists. \nElena Hammel holds a Bachelor of Music from the New England Conservatory of Music and a Master of Music from the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin. As half of Duo Scarbo, she performed at venues all over the world, including Carnegie Hall. She is now a Montessori preschool teacher. \nHammel was born in Puerto Rico in 1974, eighteen years before Nydia M. Velázquez became the first Puerto Rican woman elected to Congress. \nThese women live where the two stories merge. The women crowding America's streets owe so much to the women who marched for them. It is only fitting that they do the same for their daughters.

She holds an MFA in creative writing from Rutgers-Camden. When she was born in 1961, the main campus at Rutgers was nine years away from opening its doors to women.
