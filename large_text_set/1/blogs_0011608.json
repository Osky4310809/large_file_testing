Unfortunately, that’s what they’ve got. 1. 34 Models Are Affected, and Were Sold From March 2011 to November 2016 Samsung’s Smart Care washer and dryer are on display at the 2013 International CES at the Las Vegas Convention Center Many of the top-loading washers are being recalled due to injuries. (Getty) \nThe models are all top-loading washing machines from Samsung, and a list can be found here . Consumers can check to see if their model is affected by looking at the labels found attached to the rear of the machine. If you think your machine has been recalled, try to contact Samsung immediately with your serial number. \nSince the recall affects washers over five years and 34 models, Samsung will be dealing with the aftermath for a long time — much longer than the Galaxy Note 7, most likely. 2. What Do Consumers Do With Their Recalled Machines? Samsung recalls millions of washing machines after reports that the lids of the machines can pop off violently https://t.co/gmWFVBiCND pic.twitter.com/giPkoNuTjG \n— CNN (@CNN) November 4, 2016 \nThere are three options for consumers who currently own a recalled washing machine. First, anyone who believes their machine has been recalled should contact Samsung immediate, the CPSC said . \n1. The first option is to schedule a free in-home repair from Samsung, which would also extend the manufacturer’s warranty for a year. The repair would reinforce the top of the machine. \n2. The second option would be to receive a rebate to use to purchase another washing machine. According to the CPSC, it doesn’t have to be a Samsung machine, and the company will cover installation of the new until and removal of the old one. \n3. The third and final option is a full refund. However, the CPSC reported, this potion is only available for those who purchased their machine within 30 days of the recall notice being posted. 3. Out of 733 Reports, Nine Injuries Have Been Reported So Far A washing machine is featured at the home appliances section at the booth of South Korean electronics giant Samsung ahead of the opening of the 55th IFA electronics trade fair in Berlin. (Getty) \nSamsung has received 733 reports of washing machines that have had issues with “excessive vibration” or the top actually detaching for the rest of the chassis, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission . \nOut of those 733 reports, nine included serious injuries, including a broken jaw, injured shoulder and “other impact or fall-related injuries,” reported the CPSC. 4. 2.8 Million Machines Are Being Recalled, More Than the Galaxy Note 7 Samsung’s Flex Duo Range, Samsung’s Automatic Top Loading Washing Machine with ACTIVWash+ and Samsung CycloneForce sensor bagless cylinder vacuum cleaners are displayed at a press event for Samsung at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. Many of the companys top loading washing machines are being recalled. (Getty) \nThe number of washers recalled has far exceeded the number of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones recalled last month by the same company. While there were around 1.9 million Galaxy Note 7’s recalled last month, according to The New York Times , there are 2.8 million washing machines, sold over the course of five years and spanning 34 models, being recalled now. \nThis recall seems a bit less urgent, however, since washing machine malfunctions aren’t quite as immediate an issue as phones catching fire in users’ pockets. 5. Last Time Something Like This Happened, Repairs Were Sub-Par Unable to stop their phones and washing machines from exploding, Samsung announced today they're changing their name to the ACME Corp. \n— Just Bill (@WilliamAder) November 4, 2016 \nAccording to The New York Times , Samsung went through a similar recall in 2013 for a measly 144,000 washing machines. This was in Australia, not the U.S., and the machines were causing fires, not throwing detaching lids around. \nApparently, the repairs that Samsung sanctioned were sub-par, and involved using plastic bags to cover some connectors, The New York Times reported. \nThe unsatisfactory repairs led a group of 4,000 owner of the recalled washing machines to create a Facebook group aimed at raising money for an expert to look at the fixes, said The New York Times . That expert said that the plastic bag fixes were not sufficient. \nHopefully Samsung does a little more with this round of recalls. Jackie Peterson is a tech/science contributor for Heavy.
