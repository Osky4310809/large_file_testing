The popular coffeehouse just teamed up with French fashion house Paul & Joe to release a whimsical line of tumblers, ceramic mugs, and tote bags. With a dreamy pastel color scheme, it's giving us so many Spring vibes. \nThe limited-edition merchandise features doodles of Paul & Joe founder Sophie Méchaly's cat, Gipsy, as well as illustrations of cherry blossoms and butterflies. The only downside to this pretty collaboration? Its products are only available in Starbucks stores in Asia — bummer! Word around town is that people have already started reselling these cute items on eBay with quite the hefty upcharges. I guess we'll just have to settle for fawning over photos of the collection ahead and ordering our drinks in those bright pastel cups instead this Spring.
