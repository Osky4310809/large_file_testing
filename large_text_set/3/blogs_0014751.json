Here are Fore Things to know from Saturday at Bay Hill. \nHoffman changed the narrative in about 30 minutes . Kisner was two groups ahead of Hoffman and held a three-shot lead when he finished off a 4-under 68. Hoffman appeared to be heading in the other direction after consecutive bogeys on Nos. 14 and 15. Then, the four-time PGA Tour winner capped off his round with birdies on 16, 17 and 18, the last with a 70-foot putt that he estimated had about 12 feet of break. \nRory McIlroy and Rickie Fowler served as an awesome opening act . Fowler and McIlroy were both done before the leaders teed off, but they showed there were low scores to be had. They each recorded 7-under 65s to give themselves a chance on Sunday. McIlroy finished at 6 under, one stroke ahead of Fowler, and five strokes off the lead. \nJason Day and Emiliano Grillo showed Bay Hill still has bite . Yes, there were low numbers on Moving Day , but there are still plenty hazards waiting for anyone who is off their game. Day shot 1-over on the front nine, and then he was toast after finding the water on the par-4 13 th for a double bogey. He shot 75. Grillo started the day one shot behind Hoffman, but he came unglued on the par-5 sixth when he hit two balls (and threw his club) into the water and made a 9 on his way to a 78, 10 strokes higher than his second-round score. \nMatt Fitzpatrick is not the only young English star to watch on Sunday. Tyrrell Hatton continues to make a name for himself with another strong showing through three rounds. The 25-year-old finished T-4 at the Honda and 10 th at the WGC in Mexico, and now he shares third place with Fitzpatrick and Marc Leishman after a third-round 67.
