File photo \nMANILA, Philippines - A former president of a state college in Abra has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for allegedly implementing anomalous projects on campus. \nIn a 90-page decision issued over the weekend, the Sandiganbayan convicted Santiago Labanen, former president of the Abra State Institute of Science and Technology (ASIST), for violating Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. \nLabanen was also convicted of malversation of public funds under the Revised Penal Code. \nThe anti-graft court ordered Labanen to pay a fine of P36,000 and forfeited his retirement benefits. \nThe case, filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in 1993, stemmed from the renovation of the school’s dormitory and vocational building, construction of administration building and teachers’ cottage, and purchase of a used vehicle. \nThe allegedly anomalous projects were reportedly implemented when Labanen was school president from 1987 to 1988.   \nThe court said the prosecution presented evidence showing no renovation was implemented in the dormitory and vocational building. \nIt said the construction of the administration building and teachers’ cottage were done without any approved plans, specification and work program, which resulted in an excess payment amounting to P449,065. \nLabanen presented technical plans for the two buildings in 2002, but failed to present the same in 1989 despite demands by the Commission on Audit. \n“Labanen’s documents were incredible,” the court said, adding the building plans were not signed and certified. \nThe prosecution said no public bidding was conducted for the purchase of the used vehicle worth P85,000. \nThe Sandiganbayan acquitted Labanen’s co-accused, former ASIST auditor Abraham Mendoza, after the prosecution failed to establish his guilt.
