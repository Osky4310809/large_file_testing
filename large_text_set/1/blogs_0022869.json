My wife says to her, ‘Well, you know, in the next couple of years, I think maybe you’re going to want to hang around the city more on the weekends so you can see boys.’ You know, my daughter says, ‘That’s sexist,’” he said. \n“They just want to use these words. ‘That’s racist. That’s sexist. That’s prejudice.’ They don’t even know what they’re talking about.” \nDuring a 2014 interview with Buzzfeed Seinfeld made similar comments after being confronted about the number of “white males” on his aforementioned web series. \nWatch: Jerry Seinfeld Is Tired of Political Correctness NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
