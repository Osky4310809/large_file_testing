(DCPI) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, January 10, 2017, 4:19 PM \nA Brooklyn judge sentenced a rapist to over a century in prison for breaking into an elderly woman’s home and viciously assaulting her for several hours . \nA judge convicted Asa Robert after six days of deliberation for breaking into an 82-year-old woman’s Brighton Beach home on July 13, 2015 armed with a knife. \n“The defendant’s crimes in this case are almost unspeakable. I commend the victim for testifying and making sure that this defendant was held accountable for this horrific assault,” said Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. \nAssistant District Attorney Olatokunbo Olaniyan informed Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Vincent Del Giudice that the octogenarian was too traumatized to give a victim impact statement in court on Tuesday and urged him to sentence 20-year-old Robert to the maximum of 122 years in prison. \nBrooklyn rape victim, 83, confronts attack suspect in court \n“There’s no logical reason to offer any mercy to this defendant. He showed no mercy to his victim... A woman of her age should never, never be subjected to the behavior of this defendant,” said Del Giudice. \nFor four hours, Robert tied up the woman, now 84, repeatedly raped her and ordered her not to call the police. \nDel Giudice sentence Robert to 115 years in prison on grounds he is “not able to be rehabilitated.” \nRobert, who refused to enter the courtroom in order to avoid having his photo taken, relayed a message through his attorney, Sam Karliner, that he is innocent. \nBrooklyn NYPD commander apologizes for dismissive rape comments \n“Today’s sentence reflects the depravity of his conduct as proven at trial and is necessary to protect the public from a clearly dangerous individual,” said Gonzalez. \nRobert has an upcoming trial slated to begin in February for assaulting a police officer who arrested him while the rapist was on the run. A guilty verdict could bring an extra seven years to Robert’s sentence.
