You’re not really trapped. … It’s got a multiple-line (groove) that you can choose from, depending on the capability of the car.” \nCharlotte Motor Speedway currently holds two NASCAR Premier Series points races, plus the exhibition All-Star Race, on its 1.5-mile oval track. \nBut Monster Energy Cup Series driver AJ Allmendinger tested a Cup car on the purpose-built road course in January. Speedway Motorsports Inc. CEO Marcus Smith since has confirmed that he has talked with NASCAR about the possibility of running CMS’ annual fall playoff race on the road course in the future, possibly as soon as in 2018 after additional upgrades are made to it. \nAndretti seems like he would be a fan of it. \nThe only driver ever to win a Formula One World Championship, a Daytona 500 and an Indianapolis 500 also competed in the 1967 Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in a Holman-Moody Ford, finishing 27th after being involved in a crash. \nBut that was on the 1.5-mile oval. The road course is, of course, a totally different animal. \nAndretti took Marcus Smith for a ride on the road course Tuesday, as well as Sonic Automotive vice chairman David Smith (Marcus’ brother) and former Formula One, IndyCar and NASCAR driver Max Papis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:42:04.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
