But it also included scenes from home movies; among them a very young Carrie mugging for the camera. \nFans still mourning the duo might have hoped for a longer tribute from the Globes. Indeed, Jimmy Fallon’s introduction of the clip was longer than the tribute itself. But it was a bittersweet reminder of just how alike and how close Fisher and Reynolds were despite their very public differences. \nWe’ll have the video above when it appears online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:59:05.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
