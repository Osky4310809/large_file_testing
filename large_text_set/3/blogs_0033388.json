I am a two-time member of the smashed screen club , even though both times my phone was in a freaking case. So I need a heavy-duty phone case. I look for words like “military grade”, “6 foot drop-tested”, and “will survive a nuclear holocaust”. Here are seven of the most ridiculously heavy-duty cases on the market. 1. Otterbox Defender \n(source) \nThe Otterbox Defender features three layer defense — a plastic screen cover, a foam-lined inner shell, and a bulky outer shell. It will take you, no joke, 20 minutes to get your phone into or out of this case. And it goes through a rigorous testing process, including a thermal shock test, a jeans pocket test, a makeup resistance test, and a cross-cut adhesion test (whatever that is). I had this case for about a day and had to return it because I thought it was too difficult to type through the plastic screen cover. If you do a lot of texting and tweeting like I do, this case may not be for you... unless you have very strong fingers. My little mortal fingers were no match for this heavy duty case. 2. X-Doria Defense Lux \n(source) \nThe X-Doria Defense Lux is made out of metal instead of plastic on the outside and soft rubber inside. It’s drop tested from 6.6 feet (2 meters) on concrete. Connor S. says in a review on their website, “This is the single best case I own and own 20. It can be dropped from 50 ft twice!” What is Connor’s life?! Who owns 20 phone cases? Does he have 20 phones? Why is he dropping his phone from 50 feet? Twice?! 3. Griffin Survivor \nThe Griffin Survivor calls itself “ridiculously over-engineered”. It’s 10 foot (three meter) drop tested, with four layers of protection, including a sliding plastic screen protector to avoid the Otterbox's \"incredibly strong fingers\" requirement. 4. Lifeproof Fre Power \n(source) \nThe Lifeproof Fre case is waterproof, snowproof, dirtproof, and dropproof. It’s submersible up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) and survives drops from 4 feet. The Power version of the case provides doubles your phone's battery life, so you don’t have to recharge in the middle of your underwater dusty snow adventure. And man, I hope your adventure is worth it — the Fre Power case will cost you a whopping $130! 5. Spraytect Self-Defense iPhone Case \nMaybe you need a different kind of toughness for your phone case. You don’t just want your phone case to withstand falls, you want it to attack people . Then this pepper spray phone case is for you. 6. ADAPPT Multi-Tool iPhone Case \nThis phone case not only protects from falls using a poly-carbonate exterior, but also houses a pocket knife, screwdriver, wrench, and bottle opener for all your rugged needs. 7. Bulletproof case \n(source) \nMaybe your life goes beyond the rugged into the ridiculous. You don’t need a phone that can survive a fall, you need a phone that can survive a gunshot. Well, the Marudai case — with its back plate of solid steel — can stop a .50 caliber bullet. Your phone needs to be bolted in with an Allen wrench and is only bulletproof from one side, as the other side is open for use. So if you need only one side of your phone to be able to stop bullets and you have $650 to spend on a phone case, this case is for you. \nDid I miss any good heavy-duty cases?
