The weapon was described as a “large double-edged sword.” \nMedina claimed that he stabbed the man in self-defense, after he locked himself and his girlfriend in his room to keep away from Sutter. According to his account, Sutter broke down the door, charged Medina, and he stabbed him in defense. \nMedina’s lawyer said he was “happy and enthusiastic” with the deal, as he was experiencing anxiety about going to prison. Under the original charge, he faced 26 years in prison, but faces only 6 years with the plea deal. \nNBC News recounted Medina’s professional success as an actor before the event: \nMedina appeared on American television as the Red Lion Wild Force Ranger, leading the “Power Rangers Wild Force” in 2002. He returned to the franchise in 2011 and 2012 as part of “Power Rangers Super Samurai,” and also had small roles on “ER” and “CSI: Miami,” according to IMDB. \nThe entertainment website TMZ obtained footage of Medina in court. \nThe news comes at a bad time for the franchise, which is set to be released as a feature film on March 24th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T03:42:31.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
