Lorde is going to do “SNL,” which means new music is definitely on the way Finally the time is upon us! Lorde is set to perform on Saturday Night Live , which means that new music is just around the corner.\nIf you can believe it, it’s been nearly four (!) years since Lorde burst onto the scene and released her debut album, the incredible Pure Heroine. Since then, the star has been badgered by her fans on social media CONSTANTLY, with some asking whether the followup would ever materialize .\nThen, on her 20th birthday, Lorde penned a stunning letter to the world where she opened up about her life and what she had been up to in the years since her debut, saying that she felt like she needed to go and experience the world, saying that she’d had “a colossal year! One for the ages.” \n& A NOTE FROM THE DESK OF A NEWBORN ADULTTomorrow I turn 20, and it s all I ve been able to think about for days. I walk...\nPosted by Lorde on  Sunday, November 6, 2016 Now it seems that Lorde’s return to music could come sooner than expected.
