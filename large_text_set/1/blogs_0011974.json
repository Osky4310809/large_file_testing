The second innings in Delhi in 2013, unfortunately, wasn’t particularly convincing as India romped to a six-wicket victory to seal a 4-0 series sweep. \nMaxwell has fared better in the limited overs arena in India with 248 runs at 41.33 and 136 runs at 27.20 in ODIs and T20Is respectively. But it is in the Indian Premier League where he has made his name — and many millions of dollars — representing the Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab in 43 matches between 2012 and 2016. \nASHTON AGAR \nCareer: 2 Tests, 130 runs at 32.50 ... 2 wickets at 124.00 In India: N/A \nAgar’s only international outing in India was a forgettable affair. He conceded 0-18 off one over and was dismissed for nine against New Zealand during the World T20 in Dharamsala last year. \nHe has taken six wickets in two first class games against India A in Chennai in 2013 and 2015. Agar has also played four List A games for Australia A in India, as well as representing the Perth Scorchers eight times in the now defunct T20 Champions League in India in 2013. THE SPINNERS \nCareer: 63 Tests, 228 wickets at 34.07 In India: 3 Tests, 15 wickets at 37.33 media_camera Australia's Nathan Lyon. \nLyon was controversially omitted from the second Test on the 2013 tour of India. His return of 3-215 in the first innings in Chennai came at an economy rate of 4.57, with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar (81), Virat Kohli (107) and MS Dhoni (224) launching him for a combined 18 fours and seven sixes. \nLyon was recalled for the third Test after the spin duo of Xavier Doherty and Glenn Maxwell failed to make significant inroads. He collected career best figures of 7-94 in the first innings of the fourth Test in Delhi and finished with nine wickets for the match. \nSTEVE O’KEEFE \nCareer: 4 Tests, 14 wickets at 32.78 In India: N/A \nO’Keefe may not have played a Test there to date, but he has nonetheless enjoyed his time in India. He claimed 14 wickets at 20.07 in a two-match Australia A tour in 2015, including figures of 6-82 in the first innings in Chennai. And he took six wickets at 16.66 for NSW in the now-defunct T20 Champions League six years ago. He has also played a handful of limited overs matches for the Australia U19s in India. \nO’Keefe has taken half his Test wickets in Asia — namely in Dubai against Pakistan and in Pallekelle against Sri Lanka. \nMITCHELL SWEPSON \nCareer : N/A \nIn India : N/A \nThe bolter of the touring party. With only 14 first class matches to his name, Swepson has held out the challenge of Travis Head for the final spin-bowling/all-rounder position. Save for high school trips, Swepson has had precious little experience outside Australia - he has played all his first class, List A and Twenty20 cricket on these shores. \nThe 23-year-old is the equal fifth leading wicket-taker in the Big Bash League this season with nine at 20.11. Trevor Hohns has described him as a “wicket-taking leg spinner” and Shane Warne has sung his praises during the summer. THE QUICKS \nMITCHELL STARC \nCareer: 34 Tests, 143 wickets at 24.33 In India: 2 Tests, 2 wickets at 36.25 \nStarc’s major Test contribution in India to date was with the bat when he clubbed a career-best 99 from 144 balls at No. 9 in the first innings in Mohali. He also claimed the wickets of Murali Vijay and MS Dhoni during the match. \nStarc went wicketless in his only ODI in India, but has fared better in the Indian Premier League. He has taken 34 wickets at 20.38 for the Royal Challengers Bangalore. media_camera Matt Renshaw and Mitchell Starc. \nJOSH HAZLEWOOD \nCareer: 26 Tests, 109 wickets at 24.78 In India: N/A \nHazlewood will enter the Border-Gavaskar series as the world’s No. 1 ranked Test fast bowler. Whether he will still be holding that mantle afterwards is anyone’s guess given how little elite cricket he has played in India. \nHazlewood has played two Twenty20 internationals, claiming one wicket, and been contracted by the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League, albeit without playing a game for them. He perform solidly on Australia’s Test tour of Sri Lanka with seven wickets at 32.71. \nJACKSON BIRD \nCareer: 8 Tests, 34 wickets at 27.47 In India: N/A \nBird has never played a Test, ODI or T20I in Asia. He took 0-10 for Australia against an Indian Board President’s XI in Chennai four years ago. And he took six wickets at 25.00 in seven U19 ODIs way back in 2005 and 2006.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:32:16.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
