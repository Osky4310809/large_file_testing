Photograph courtesy of Getty Images/Skechers Performance Los Angeles Marathon \nNearly 20,000 runners completed the 2017 Los Angeles Marathon, but only a handful of finishers went home being able to boast that they set a world record. \nThat’s because new to this year’s race was that Guinness World Records partnered with the event to provide on-site verification for any runner looking to enter the record books. Eight runners suited up in costumes—ranging from a 3D flamingo to a Mario Kart—and took advantage of the opportunity. Some records had previously been set, while others were brand new. (Guinness’s team creates minimum standards for all new categories based on similar existing marks or difficulty.)
