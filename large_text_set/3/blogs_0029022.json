He will be one of the only cops in the country to have ever had the procedure done, according to Newsday.\nThere was at least one officer in the Arizona State Police who was a double amputee, the newspaper reports.\nDuring Ferreira’s training, officials said he practiced taking down aggressive suspects wearing a protective suit. He only fell once — and was able to hop right back up immediately.\n“If you have somebody coming at you and attacking you, we didn’t know how that was going to end up, we didn’t know if he would fall and not be able to get back up, so\n‘For us it was an important moment,” said Lt. Steven Rohde, commanding officer of the academy’s recruit training section.\n“Kind of an exclamation point on, ‘This guy’s the real deal. I wouldn’t want to fight him!’”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:19:43.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
