And apparently there was a secret Beauty and the Beast easter egg for Frozen that was left on the cutting room floor, and we’re honestly a little heartbroken about it.\nThere are all kinds of internet theories floatin g around that explain how various Disney Princess stories are intertwined ( like Tangled and Frozen ) and we’re mostly here for all that theorizing, but we’re just as delighted by simple callbacks in movies we love to other movies we loved.\nApparently, at one point, LeFou was supposed to turn into a snowman. That would’ve been an ah-mazing easter egg for fans of Frozen who know that Josh Gad, aka LeFou, is also aka Olaf the snowman.\nWhen asked about whether or not there were easter eggs to look out for, Josh Gad was quick to tell People us what we were missing.\n“The Easter egg I fought for [director] Bill Condon to put in but we never did, there’s a moment in the original where a bunch of snow falls on LeFou and he becomes a snowman and I thought, this could kill. It’s a little meta but it could be great.” It’s funny to think as an actor in a movie, you don’t actually know what’s going to make it to the big screen in the final cut, since you don’t really have much of a say. Always the funny guy, Josh Gad was quick to poke fun at that, too.\n“We’re not even guaranteed that we’re going to be in the movie. It’s all based on our interview performances.” Here’s to whatever Disney movie Josh Gad ends up in next.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:48:23.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
