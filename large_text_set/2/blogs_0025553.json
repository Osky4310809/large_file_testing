The critical question is which one people have embraced,” said pollster George Barna, who oversaw the survey. “If we want to transform our culture then we will need to change the choices people make that produce that culture. And in order to change those choices we must identify the beliefs that led to those choices.” \nPerhaps surprisingly, 46 percent of those polled reported having a biblical worldview, but their answers were not consistent with their profession.   \nFor example, a mong the views adopted in a related survey by ACFI by a majority of Americans that would not be consistent with the Bible are a belief that people are basically good (74 percent) and having faith matters more than what faith a person has (66 percent).
