It remains unclear just what the nature of his knee ailment is, or if it will require surgery, but with World Cup qualifiers approaching in March, Cameron's availability for the U.S. remains in question. \nCameron is in Southern California to undergo evaluations by the U.S. national team medical staff to determine a course of action to try and address the condition of his knee. Reports in England had identified his issue as a hyperextended knee, but the prolonged length of his absence from action suggests it could be more serious. \nCameron is in the area just as the U.S. national team is about to begin its January training camp, which should give him an opportunity to meet with new U.S. coach Bruce Arena, who he has not previously played for. When healthy, Cameron remains the best and most consistent defensive option in the U.S. national team pool, and Arena will be eager to see him recover in time for crucial World Cup qualifiers against Honduras and Panama in March. \nCameron was forced to miss the World Cup qualifying losses to Mexico and Costa Rica last November, and his absence was definitely felt in a defense that was nowhere near as solid as it was at last summer's Copa America, or even last September's World Cup qualifiers, which Cameron did take part in. \nThe injury absence is the second prolonged absence of Cameron's career due to a knee injury. He missed half of the 2010 MLS season after undergoing knee surgery during his time with the Houston Dynamo. Since making the move to Stoke City, Cameron had a good record of durability, averaging 32 league matches played per season during his first four seasons in England.
