Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nOn particularly rough mornings, we're often faced with a tough choice: coffee or wine? And thanks to a new, wine-infused coffee from a Napa Valley company, we can have the best of both worlds without being judged. What exactly is wine-infused coffee? The Molinari Private Reserve makes wine-infused coffee ($20 for a half-pound bag) by letting coffee beans sit in a bath of red wine, absorbing its flavors. The beans are then dried and hand-roasted in small batches and packaged for sale. From there, you brew the coffee as you would any regular blend, and you can drink it black, cold, in a latte, or as espresso, or you can use it as a rub. Yes, it's alcohol free, but the essence of wine still comes through. \nImage Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Sheila Gim \nThis coffee took two years to develop, and it's the first of its kind. While Molinari is not a winery itself, it uses a house red wine created exclusively for Molinari by local Napa Valley wineries. Adding milk to the wine-infused coffee brings out the wine more, while drinking it black from a French press \"emphasizes the blueberry essence,\" the company claims. We have a feeling the full-bodied, fruity coffee would be perfect with an after-dinner chocolaty dessert, too. You can find the bags of coffee at Molinari Caffe, Robert Mondavi Winery, Franciscan Estate Winery, JCB Wines, and online , but it's currently out of stock. However, Molinari Reserve assures its eager customers that it's stocking up ASAP. \nIn that case, we'll take another cup, please!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:33:15.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
