Late-night king Jimmy Kimmel set out to find out in a raucous segment where his reporter identified couples on the street, divided them on either side of a wall, and asked them to jot down their estimate on how many times they had sex in one month. In this twisted take on the classic prisoner’s dilemma, couples were forced to self-report their coitus records on live television, which definitely couldn’t end badly for anyone involved. Because guys, again, are totally honest about how often we have sex. \nThe first couple was unmarried but together for 3 years (which got a bit awkward when Kimmel, back in the studio, emphasized that 3 years is a long time ). Yet the guy and girl’s discrepancy in monthly sex count was only two—whereas a couple married for 36 years had worse luck. The man answered “two,” while the woman answered “10,” which got awkward real quick. (Maybe he was asleep the entire time?) Finally, a couple of 38 years answered 10 times a month (for the man) and 2.634 boinks per month (for the woman), which either indicates a another serious misunderstanding, or that long-term couples simply don’t care whether people think they’re getting laid or not.
