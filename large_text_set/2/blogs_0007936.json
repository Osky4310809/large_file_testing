Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHundreds of football fans stood in blustery winds for nearly FIVE hours to secure tickets to Sutton United's historic FA Cup tie with Arsenal. \nTemperatures plummeted as low as minus one at Sutton's Gander Green Lane home, where tickets went on sale to regular fans on Sunday morning. \nSupporters queued right around the pitch and back out into the car park in a bid to get their hands on their golden ticket to the club's biggest day. \nOver 5,000 fans are expected to cram into the Borough Sports Ground, which has an artificial 3G surface, for the Monday night clash on February 20. \nSutton chairman Bruce Elliott had the unenviable task of telling regular fans that only one ticket would be issued per season ticket. \nBut the brave-faced club veteran was amicable in responsive when answering the concerns of those queuing. \nIt was initially suggested that Sutton could move the fixture away from their home ground and play it at nearby Crystal Palace.
