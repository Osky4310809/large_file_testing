But can a streaming service succeed as a perk bundled with free two-day shipping? \nAt TechCrunch’s Disrupt NY conference in May, we’ll ask the most aptly named executive in tech, Amazon’s VP of Music Steve Boom. Formerly a 10-year Yahoo employee who ended up as an SVP before working at location startup Loopt, Boom will discuss the shifting dynamics of the digital music economy. \nWill Amazon do for musicians what it did for book authors, democratizing access to an audience willing to pay? And will streaming services have the same impact on record labels as they did on book stores, replacing the physical distribution channels with a convenient but frighteningly centralized repository of content? \nHow will voice control change music consumption? What differentiates Amazon Music? And will Amazon fund original audio content the way it produces shows for Prime Instant Video? \nGet your tickets for Disrupt NY to hear Boom speak about how commerce and content will intertwine. \nSteve Boom joins a variety of all-star guests, which you can check out here . \nSponsorships make TechCrunch events possible.
