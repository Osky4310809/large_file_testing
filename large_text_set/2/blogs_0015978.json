Maybe putting everything together, he wasn't that comfortable from the start. \n\"We had to make the substitution. It's the same problem. He'll miss some games but hopefully it's not too bad.\" Read More Newcastle 2-0 Aston Villa: Magpies go top through Yoan Gouffran and own goal but Dwight Gayle crocked on return Benitez supports Gayle as he's forced to make a substitution (Photo: Rex Features) \nNewcastle edged ahead in the 42nd minute when Yoan Gouffran pounced in a crowded penalty area to earn the lead before a Henri Lansbury own-goal just before the hour sealed the points and moved the Magpies back to the top of the Championship. \n\"We said before that every game in the Championship is difficult, we were up against a good team with good players and we have to give credit to them,\" added Benitez. \n\"Our second goal was important because we could settle and be more dangerous. They have very good players, they can pass, they can run and beat players one v one. At the moment they maybe don't have the confidence. \n\"They were asking me about the games we have coming up, but we have to concentrate on every single game. \n\"Now we have to be strong enough to get three points in every single game. I have confidence that we can still do it. We have to use the squad and we will enjoy this.\" Scott Hogan is treated on the pitch (Photo: Aston Villa FC) \nThere was also an injury blow for Villa boss Steve Bruce, with striker Scott Hogan being stretchered off in the closing stages after going over on his ankle in the penalty area. \nBruce is still waiting for a first win in 2017, dating back to Boxing Day, and that run of form has seen Villa drop to within six points of the relegation zone. \nBruce said: \"All in all a very disappointing night for everyone. \n\"The injury to Scott Hogan doesn't look good. He has gone up for the header and he has turned his ankle over. We will not know the extent of it until (Tuesday). \n\"It's a nasty one, we will get him back to Birmingham and have him scanned. Fingers crossed. \n\"We have had a tough eight weeks, I have not known an eight weeks like it. We have to stay with it and hope we can break.

Newcastle needed that because up to that, before half-time, I felt we were the better side.\" \nHe added: \"The situation we are in, of course, we have to accept it, but I am confident we won't (go down). We have to deal with the situation we are in. I don't think I have been on a run like this, eight games or whatever it is. We have to hope things will change for us. \n\"This club has been in a rut for a couple of years. I can only say the last four or five games, that was exactly the same out there. We have done okay and haven't got a break. When you are up against it we have not had the breaks.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:15:31.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
