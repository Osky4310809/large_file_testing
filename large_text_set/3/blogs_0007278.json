S. Representative, proudly serving North Carolina's 1st Congressional District. Follow my work in Washington and #NC01. Mar 7 Reality Check: Repealing the ACA is a Plan Set Up for Failure At long last, House Republicans released their bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s signature law. In his address to Congress last week, President Trump promised a healthcare program that would “expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare.” The bill revealed by House Republicans last night does none of these things. This plan will cost Americans more money while providing fewer protections- and will lead to millions losing healthcare altogether. Here are the top 5 things to know about TrumpCare: 1. It will take healthcare from millions of Americans. Almost 11 million Americans became eligible for Medicaid coverage after the ACA was enacted. TrumpCare will phase out Medicaid expansion by 2020, breaking the financing promise made to states when the ACA was enacted. 2. It allows insurance companies to charge older Americans more. Under the ACA, older Americans can be charged no more than 3 times that of a young person. TrumpCare implements an “age tax” that allows insurers to charge an older person 5 times more than a young person. 3. Tax credits will decrease overall, especially for the poor and elderly. The Republican plan provides significantly less financial support to those purchasing individual insurance plans through the marketplace. Under the ACA, tax credits were determined based on income level, geographic region, and age. TrumpCare’s tax credit is determined exclusively on age. TrumpCare provides a $600 billion tax cut to the rich while leaving millions of working families with higher costs and less coverage. The ACA strengthened the Medicare Trust Fund by extending its life by over a decade, letting our senior citizens know we have their backs. TrumpCare puts Medicare at risk by shortening the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 2 years, threatening coverage for 57 million Americans. 4. Pre-existing conditions will be grounds for costlier insurance again. Under the ACA, insurers cannot discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, asthma, or heart disease. TrumpCare implements a continuous coverage requirement for those with pre-existing conditions. If someone has a lapse in coverage, insurance companies could charge a 30 percent premium increase for an entire year. 5. The repeal bill was drafted in secret, and introduced less than two days before markup. TrumpCare is unusual in that is has not yet been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, the federal agency that determines the costs and impacts proposed legislation will have. Additionally, the American people are not being given time to read and comment on the bill. You can voice your opinion on this legislation by finding your members of Congress and calling their offices. Your voice is needed in this fight. Be heard. The Affordable Care Act did not fix all the problems, but it is a step in the right direction to making healthcare more affordable and accessible for working families, seniors, business owners, and taxpayers alike. Alternatively, the Republican ACA repeal plan jeopardizes the health and financial well-being of millions of Americans. I plan to oppose this legislation every step of the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:53:06.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
