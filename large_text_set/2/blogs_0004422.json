Lekin bhashan se paet (stomach) nahi bharta.” (You are very smart in speaking and good at mouthing speeches. But speeches do not fill stomach). Bolne mein tez hain aap, bhashan me bahut ache. Lekin bhshan se paet (stomach) nahi bharta: Cong’s Mallikarjun Kharge in LS #BudgetSession \n— ANI (@ANI_news) February 6, 2017 \nCiting Centre’s plans of bullet trains, Kharge said that ‘you speak to get applause, but have you succeeded?’ Kharge further attacked PM Modi saying, “Your government is a failure at MGNREGA as well as the railways.” Kharge also said that 125 people died after PM Modi took the decision of demonetisation on November 8 and the least Prime Minister could have done is apologise. \nThe former Railways minister also blamed the government for dividing the unity of the nation. He said “In name of sanatan dharm you want people to be divided. Bhagwan ka naam lete ho emotionally blackmail karne ke liye.” (You take name of God to emotionally blackmail people.) \nFurther, hitting hard at the Bharatiya Janata Party and its contribution towards making India unite, Kharge said, “Desh ki ekta ke liye Gandhi ji ne kurbani di,Indira Ji ne kurbani di. Aapke ghar se kaun gaya? Ek kutta bhi nahi gaya!” (People such as Gandhi Ji, Indira Ji has sacrificed their lives for country’s unity, who came from your side? Not even a dog!) \nThe Congress leader also said that “Agar PM kamzori ki baat kartein hai toh message pure desh mei jaata hai; Vote ke liye aisi baatein nahi karni chahiye.” (If Prime Minister talks about weakness, then the message goes to entire country. One should not talk like this just to gain votes). \nYou might also want to see this: \nSlamming PM Modi’s talk about surgical strikes, he said “Surgical strikes ka credit lene ki zaroorat nahi hai; Sirf aap (PM) nahi, pura desh Army ke saath hai.” (Don’t take credit of Surgical Strikes, not just PM but the entire nation is with the Army) \nHitting back at the former Railways minister, Treasury benches demanded that his comment, “Apke ghar se ek kutta bhi nahi gaya” to be expunged. Responding to this, Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan said such comments must be avoided.
