The LG G6, LG’s flagship for the first half of 2017, is one such device that has the Android enthusiast community all pumped up.\nA new leak showcases the upcoming G6 from multiple angles, giving us the best look at the device so far.\n\nStarting off, we get a glimpse of the thin bezels that the device is said to be sporting. The top and the chin appear very compact, and the side bezels have a negligible width to them. We can also see the metallic mid frame of the device, along with the plastic antenna line at the top part of the frame. Interestingly, the display sports rounded corners.\nThe bottom of the device sports the speaker grille as well as the USB Type-C port. The top of the device retains the 3.5mm headphone jack port. There is no IR Blaster visible on the device, which is strange as both the LG G5 and the LG V20 sported one. There is no pseudo-modularity at play here either, which is no longer a surprise .\n\nThe back of the device sports a brushed metal finish. The fingerprint sensor on the back doubles up as the power button in conventional LG fashion. The dual camera setup is also clearly visible.\nSo far, the images leaked line up with the previous leaks of the device. This particular leak did not mention any new information outside of the pictures, but previous reports have given us a fair clue. The LG G6 is likely to come with a 5.7″ 1440 x 2880 resolution display , Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC and will forego the removable battery in favor of water resistance.\nThe LG G6 is tipped to launch on 26th February. Stay tuned for more coverage!\nWhat are your thoughts on the LG G6? Do the current leaks appease to your expectations?
