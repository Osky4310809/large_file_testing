Well, we went through the annals of flops, busts, injuries and malcontents to come up with the 10 biggest disappointments in recent NBA history — including one that will send you into a rage until you stop to think it through. Mitchell Leff 10 Grant Hill (1995-2013) \nHill was the best in a line of \"The Next Michael Jordans.\" He might even have been the first LeBron James, minus a little bit of bulk. \nHe could do everything on the court, and do it all well. His career looked to be on the perfect trajectory, too, until a fateful ankle injury in 2000 changed everything. \nHill received poor advice from the Pistons medical staff and played when he should have been resting, which started a cascade of injuries that robbed the former Duke standout of his superstar ability. NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Andrew Bynum (2006-14) \nPerhaps Bynum received too much attention, too soon. \nHe looked like the Lakers' next franchise center at the turn of the decade, playing a significant role in Los Angeles' 2009 and 2010 championships. \nThat was enough to make him one of the centerpieces of the Lakers' convoluted trade for Dwight Howard, despite all of Bynum's injuries and his complete disdain for his job as a professional basketball player. \nBynum never played a game for the Sixers after the Howard deal. He wasn't healthy and he didn't seem to have any motivation to get back into basketball shape. \nAnd you know what? That's fine. It's his life to live. \nHey, speaking of Dwight ... 8 Dwight Howard (2005-present) \nInjuries are a recurring theme on this list, and there's no doubt Howard has faced his fair share. Back problems in particular turned the man once known as Superman into plain ol' Clark Kent. \nYet Howard hasn't done himself any favors. He's a devastating finisher in the pick-and-roll who insists on working one-on-one in the post instead. Unfortunately, he can't turn his shoulders over his hips like he used to — you know, because of that back injury — so his hook shots fall flat, and he can't face up and blow by defenders these days, either. \nAdd in the way the NBA adjusted to zone defense rules and the modern evolution toward 3-point shooting, and a once promising career fizzled before our very eyes. NBAE NBAE/Getty Images Chris Webber (1994-2008) \nAfter that whole timeout kerfuffle, maybe we should have seen Webber's disappointing career coming. \nWhen the former Fab Five star was healthy and on his game, there were few better. He could run your offense as a scorer or playmaker, and Webber had an unparalleled feel for the game. \nEven then, his career got off to a rocky start, with trade demands and clashes with head coaches. Webber ran into hurdles at every point in his career, and he stumbled every time. \nIn all the versions of the cosmos, there's at least one out there where Webber reached his full potential, and the Kings built a dynasty founded on the ruins of the Shaq and Kobe Lakers. \nThis just isn't that universe. Getty Images Getty Images 6 Lamar Odom (2000-13) \nOther than his iffy shooting, Odom was the perfect glue guy for the Lakers' two most recent championship teams. His skill as a point forward was an invaluable part of the triangle offense's success. \nThen the Lakers tried to trade him for Chris Paul, and everything fell apart. We won't belabor the point, since you know that story . Here's hoping Odom continues to stay healthy moving forward. NBAE/Getty Images Andrew D. Bernstein 5 Derrick Rose (2009-present) \nIt's not over yet for Rose — but come on. It's over. \nRose looked ready to take the NBA world by storm coming off of his (now-erased) Final Four run with Memphis, and he lived up to the billing with an MVP award in just his third season. \nThe rest of the story is all too familiar to basketball fans. Rose's body completely fell apart, turning one of the best pick-and-roll point guards in modern NBA history into a has-been. \nHe still brings it every once in a while, and that's almost as bad. Each classic Rose performance is a grim reminder of who he was. 4 Adam Morrison (2007-10) \nNo one expected Morrison to be one of the greatest players of all time; we're just disappointed he never had a shot to prove what he could do on the court. \nCharlotte did the Gonzaga star no favors by drafting him way too high. Morrison was hyped as a Larry Bird-type player, because of course he was, but he struggled throughout his rookie season due to the Bobcats' need for him to carry the scoring load. \nA torn ACL the following preseason effectively ended Morrison's career — but not before he won a championship with the Lakers. 3 Penny Hardaway (1994-2008) \nMost NBA observers spend their time looking for the next Michael; Penny was the next Magic. \nHe and Shaquille O'Neal formed a perfect dynamic duo for Orlando, surging to the Finals while Michael Jordan was off playing baseball. Once His Airness came back, we should have been set for a Magic-Bulls rivalry through the end of the decade. \nInstead, Orlando's front office broke the team apart by low-balling Shaq, and Hardaway physically broke down in the wake of O'Neal's departure. Getty Images Andy Lyons Shaquille O'Neal (1993-2011) \nHear me out. \nShaq had one of the greatest careers of any professional athlete ever. He won four championships, led the most dominant playoff squad in basketball history, and thoroughly destroyed the competition (outside of Hakeem Olajuwon, anyway). I've ranked him as the fourth greatest NBA player of all time. I know of Diesel's stature. \nShaq is an absolute basketball legend — but he could have been the GOAT. \nHe crushed opponents as a rookie , ripping down defensive rebounds and going coast-to-coast against grown men like they were children. The NBA hadn't seen an athlete like Shaq since Wilt Chamberlain. He should have surpassed Jordan and led the Lakers to four or five or six straight championships. \nInstead, he decided the best way to combat all the fouls he faced was to put on a bunch of weight and just bully people, rather than out-skill them. While that strategy worked, it gave Shaq the justification to become a much larger shadow of his former self. \nHe took games off, gave up on conditioning, and, of course, feuded with Kobe. He dismantled an empire over ego. And in the end, he became an NBA nomad. \nIf that's not disappointing to you, your standards aren't high enough. This content is subject to copyright. AFP/Getty Images 1 Greg Oden (2009-14) \nOh, what could have been. \nOden was the prototypical modern center: a fierce defensive presence who would dunk all over you on the other end of the court. He also had excellent shooting touch, which somehow gets overlooked in nostalgic discussions about the former Ohio State big man. \nBefore he played his first game for the Blazers, though, Oden's NBA career was doomed. He needed microfracture surgery, which gave way to a bone bruise, then a fractured knee cap ... and that was essentially the end of the line for the most disappointing NBA career in recent memory.
