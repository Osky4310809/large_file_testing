In one of the rows, the usher found a cucumber on the floor – then quickly understood why it was there.\nThe film being shown was \"Fifty Shades Darker\", a follow-up to the blockbuster 2015 film \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Both films are erotic love stories involving bondage and the exploration of sexual fetish.\n\"That awkward moment when you find a cucumber in the cinema after a Fifty Shades session…\" the Hayden Orpheum's twitter account posted on February 13.\n\"And you pick it up without gloves?\" Twitter user Stephen R. Darragh tweeted in response.\n\"Instantly regretted that!\" the Orpheum's account tweeted back.\nThe Daily Mail noted that the photo may have in fact been a publicity move.\n\"While it could be a clever and dirty PR stunt, nevertheless the Orpheum cinema team posted the photo on social media to watch it go wild,\" writes the Daily Mail.\n“When you Google ‘regret’, it’s now the first image that comes up,” the Orpheum stated, notes News.com.au.\n“It’s probably innocent, some old lady making cucumber sandwiches to save money,\" the theater added. “Cucumber sandwiches anyone? On us!”\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" has grossed over $148 million since its global release on February 13, and pulled in over $46.6 million for its opening weekend.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:52:10.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
