He will be at the club in 2017.\" \nHe added: \"The offers we have received have been rejected.\" \nRUMOURS: Man City monitoring Mina \nMina has only been on the books at Palmeiras since May, having been snapped up by the Brazilian outfit from Santa Fe. \nHe is still relatively inexperienced, with a little over 160 competitive club outings to his name, but his rapid development has helped to enhance his reputation and he already has five senior caps for his country.
