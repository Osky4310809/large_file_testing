Sky Sports News HQ's Kaveh Solhekol relayed the news: Kaveh Solhekol @SkyKaveh West Ham interested in signing Wayne Rooney if Manchester United allow him to leave this summer. Told \"Never say never\" 3/21/2017, 11:31:21 AM Speculation over the forward's future has been rife in recent months amid reports his agent had flown to China to discuss a possible move to the Chinese Super League in February, per Sky Sports. Football writer Liam Canning and Hesham Bilal-Hafiz of the Manchester Evening News reacted to the news of West Ham's interest: Liam Canning @LiamPaulCanning Hesham Bilal-Hafiz @hesham786 Hahaha, I love this story. Not sure how much of his wages they can afford though. https://t.co/vpRiPaaazu 3/21/2017, 11:43:03 AM Rooney seems likely to leave United this summer after seeing his squad role reduce under manager Jose Mourinho. The 31-year-old, whose form has noticeably declined in recent years, has made 30 appearances in all competitions this season but has started just 19 of them and only nine in the Premier League. However, he has managed to provide five goals and 10 assists in that time, so he perhaps still has something to offer for a team like West Ham. Rooney is United's top scorer against the Hammers , having netted 12 times in 20 appearances against them during his time with the Red Devils, including a sensational strike from the halfway line in 2014. He has also been linked with a return to Everton this summer, per the Telegraph 's John Percy . While the Irons and the Toffees may not be as lucrative as a move to China and would likely require a pay cut, they would allow him to remain living in England without having to uproot his family or live apart from them, not to mention he would be able to continue plying his trade in the Premier League. If either side makes him an offer this summer, he should give it serious consideration.
