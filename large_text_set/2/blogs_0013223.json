Absolutely smitten by glittering, sparkling gemstones, my self-control vanishes as I hand over my hard-earned money in exchange for a little treasure. But I never expected my fetish for jewels would lead me to buy my own engagement ring. Especially since I’m not engaged.\nLet me explain. On a recent visit to Sydney’s central business district, I was window-shopping at some of my favorite jewelers, pausing to admire the unaffordable items I could easily imagine adorning my fingers, my ears, my neck. I found myself in the Strand Arcade where I wandered casually past a store I’d previously browsed a few months before.\nAnd then I saw it.\nThe Ring. It was breathtaking. Just sitting among the many other riches, teasing me to try it on.\nSo I did, really just to amuse myself. But as I slipped that sparkler onto my finger, time seemed to stop as it does in movie cliches. My heart was beating so fast and I felt as if I was going to be sick.\n\nCrazy right? But I knew I had found my dream engagement ring. It was not how I’d imagined it to look — far from it. In the words of Kath and Kim, it was noice, different and unusual. The owner of the store sensed my instant infatuation and, not surprisingly, encouraged me to buy it. But first, I had to convince my boyfriend.\nYes, I do have a boyfriend. Jason and I have been together close to twelve years — we don’t live together but we’ve spent many weeks at a time living in close quarters travelling the world, but we are certainly not engaged.\nWe’ve spoken about marriage many, many times and we are both confident that’s where we are heading. However as a close friend sarcastically put it, we clearly don’t want to rush things.\nOne thing I’ve drilled into him over the years is how important it is for me to choose my own engagement ring. The thought of someone else picking what should be a woman’s most treasured piece of jewelry is something I cannot fathom.\nHe’s always been happy with this — relieved actually, as it takes the pressure off, especially when he’s not a jewelry person. Inconceivable, I know!\nSo in preparation for the day when we do decide to marry, I have thousands of ‘ring-spiration’ photos on Pinterest. I happily waste hours browsing the site, pinning the jewels which I imagine being turned into my very own engagement ring. I have photos of modern rings, Art Deco rings, Victorian rings, Edwardian rings, royal gems and the occasional celebrity bling. Elegant decadence is definitely my style.\nBack to The Ring. Thankfully, Jason was nearby so soon after texting him “before we leave the city, you have to come and look at something. I’m not joking”, he was walking towards me through the Strand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:21:11.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
