Protesters hoped it would get under his skin. \n\"There's nothing that irritates him more than to know he's not popular and we don't like him,\" one of the protesters, Karen Topakian, told The Associated Press in an interview conducted via FaceTime from high up on the crane. \nDistrict of Columbia police took a hands-off approach while the protesters suspended themselves from harnesses and ropes below the crane's huge arm. Police closed three city blocks to traffic and appeared content to wait until they climbed down to be arrested. Trump says torture 'absolutely works' in first major interview \nThe protesters scaled the crane before dawn at a sprawling construction site that was previously home to The Washington Post. They revealed the banner after 9 a.m. and remained atop the crane into the afternoon before beginning a slow descent. \nJohn Evans, 46, a carpenter who works on the site, said the protesters were clearly experienced climbers, noting that they were moving their legs and shifting positions to maintain their blood circulation. \n\"Look how organized they are. They have the same equipment that I use every day,\" he said. \"They're professionals. Amateurs couldn't stay up there that long.\" The controversial laws Donald Trump has already passed The controversial laws Donald Trump has already passed 1/10 Trump and abortion \nProtesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March Getty Images 2/10 Trump and abortion \nUS President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House Getty Images 3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' \nNancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

Former president Barack Obama halted the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015 and the Army Corps of Engineers blocked the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline in December after months of protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which gets drinking water from a reservoir in the pipeline's path. \nAlso on Tuesday, Trump's administration moved to delay implementation of at least 30 environmental rules and froze new Environmental Protection Agency contracts and grant awards.
