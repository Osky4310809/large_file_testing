He also rode Space Mountain three times in a row. My favorite anecdote from this interview is presented below: Advertisement \n“There was moment when me and eight of my closest friends found ourselves, we didn’t even realize anyone else was doing it,” he said. “We were walking through Fantasyland and there was a song that was playing out of the trees and we were all doing this, dancing through, and I think at one point we all started to look around going, ‘We’re all doing the same dance, how did this happen?’” \nWhat would you do if you stumbled upon Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone accompanied by eight other dorks doing some sort of choreographed dance to the music playing out of the trees in Fantasyland? Would you assume they were high or just quirky? Would it make your day or ruin it? Were there shrooms in the brownies as welll? What kind of pot brownies would make one human this stoned?! \nI’m not even mad about it! I just want answers.
