Visitors have been blocked from reaching part of the community known for its luxury spas, posh hotels and scenic retreats.\nFor Mayer, the bridge closure means a six-hour, round-trip route several times a week to buy goods to stock the shelves. He also had to temporarily lay off 11 of his 16 employees.\nYet he’s keeping his doors open for locals who need produce, milk and propane.\n“They support me all year long, and I appreciate it,” Mayer said. “In the bad times, you’ve got to try to come through for the people who come through for you all the time.”\nThe damaged Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge sits on an active landslide, which pushed out one of two columns holding it up. Crews are working to tear down the old span and replace it with a single-span steel bridge across the canyon, which will not sit on the slide. A large section of the bridge was demolished on March 18.\nNBC Bay Area on Twitter Farewell, Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge.

The area also is without law enforcement and public services.\nGafill said Caltrans needs to prioritize the bridge replacement over other projects, or some businesses may go under. He had hoped for a different bridge design that could be built more quickly, but Cruz said the work is being expedited.\nThe bridge closure also has affected Gafill personally. His wife and 14-year-old son have moved to a friend’s condominium in Monterey to keep the boy in high school, creating chaos for the family.\n“We are constantly packing and unpacking,” he said.\n\nKirk Gafill, owner of the historic Nepenthe Restaurant, says they’re using the unexpected closure to refinish the wood and update the restaurant. (jongela19/Flickr) East of the bridge, a 2-foot-wide trail is under construction to allow people who live south of the damaged span to bypass it by walking about 30 minutes each way through steep terrain. Fire brigade escorts will bring them back and forth in the morning and evening.\n“It’s a godsend compared to what we have now, which is nothing,” Gafill said. “People are going to be in the best shape of their lives.”\nThe New Camaldoli Hermitage, a monastery known for its ocean views, is among the places that have been cut off. The two dozen monks and staff members there have been working on their spiritual fitness.\n“The morale of the house has been really good,” Prior Cyprian Consiglio said. “We are using this to simplify and get back to basics.”\nStaff cooks are no longer on the property, so the monks have been making meals. When the phones went down, they communicated with walkie-talkies.\nThe monks usually make money by hosting at least 15 people at a time on their sprawling property. But with access cut off, the rooms sit empty. An online fundraiser has generated about $245,000 of at least $500,000 needed to recover from the lost income and repair an entrance road damaged by walloping rains.\nGetting fuel is also challenging.\n\n“We are going to conserve some more,” Consiglio said.
