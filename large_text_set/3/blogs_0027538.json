(Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com) comments \nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Former Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar, who's been treated for post-concussion syndrome, made an insensitive joke on Cleveland radio Wednesday about Dwight Clark's ALS diagnosis. \nStopping by WKNR-AM in person and going on The Really Big Show with his good friend Tony Rizzo, Kosar kidded that Clark's ALS might have started back when he was general manager of the Browns from 1999-2002. \n\"We had a bad weekend with Gale Sayers being diagnosed (with dementia), Dwight Clark with ALS,\" Kosar said. \"I can make a joke about his struggles in picking players when he was here. It almost makes me wonder if maybe it started earlier.\" \nA rim shot played in a video clip directly after the quip. \nKosar went on to add, \"Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) is rough,\" and spoke about his struggles with his own health issues. \n\"I have a meeting after this with a chemist and a scientist, that holistic work I've been doing for health,'' Kosar said. \nRizzo said to him, \"You haven't been on the show in a long time. Some people know why and some don't. ... How are you feeling? We haven't talked in a while. You look great.\" \nRizzo didn't elaborate. \nKosar responded \"I've been doing so much of the holistic approach to it.'' He also didn't elaborate. \nAs for Clark, he said in a statement Monday that he didn't begin experiencing ALS symptoms until 2014. He also said he believes that football contributed to his disease, which has been linked to head trauma and CTE. \nKosar's comments didn't go without notice in the San Francisco area, where Clark remains very popular for his heroics with the 49ers. \n\"Some things you just shouldn't joke about,\" wrote Jake Montero, writing on the website for KNBR, one of the Bay Area's biggest sports radio stations. \n\"Though the disease has been linked with head trauma and CTE, ALS is not known to have degenerative mental effects in its early stages,\" Montero continued, \"rendering Kosar's joke both unfunny and illogical.\" NFL Draft 2017 Guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:17:11.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
