PA:Press Association 2 Michy Batshuayi has been warned he must do more to prove he is good enough to start at Chelsea \nThe Belgian international has now been linked with a summer move away from the Blues after failing to convince Conte he is good enough to play. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Chelsea news , gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nAnd the Chelsea boss refused to commit to Batshuayi still being at Stamford Bridge next season at his press conference ahead of Monday’s trip to West Ham. Reuters 2 Chelsea boss Antonio Conte is demanding more from his struggling striker \nAsked if Batshuayi had a Chelsea future, Conte said: “When you ask about my players the most important thing is the present, and at the end of the season we see the situation of every single player. \n“Now he is working very well with us, he must continue to work. \n“If he shows me he deserves to play I will put him in the starting eleven, if he doesn’t then we will continue in this way.” \nConte’s words were a clear message to the 22-year-old to stop moping around and start trying to prove he belongs at a club like Chelsea. \nHe has made 23 appearances for the club this season, mostly as substitute, and has netted just five times in all competitions. \nBut he is yet to start a single Premier League game, and his only goal in the competition came in the second match of the season.
