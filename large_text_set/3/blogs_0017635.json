A drunk Kapil hurled abuses at Grover, much to his surprise, and later got into a scuffle with him. Grover even apologised to his co-passengers on Kapil’s behalf. \nKapil spoke to HT about the fight and said he doesn’t remember anything. \nMujhe yaad nahi. Actually hamari har flight main ladai hoti hai. Har jagah ladai hot hai. It is a healthy fight… We fight for work… We fight for good work. \nA source close to Sunil Grover told HT the opposite. \nSunil is not coming back on The Kapil Sharma Show. He had already recorded the episodes for this weekend (March 18-19) . But he is not returning to the show. Abb bahot ho gaya. Agar Kapil ka yehi rawaiya raha toh aur log bhi nikal jayenge (enough is enough,if Kapil continues in this manner others will also quit) \nMan, this is really sad. It’ll be such a shame to see our favourite comedians part ways. 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T08:47:54.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
