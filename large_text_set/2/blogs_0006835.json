Whatever tiny, pathetic future I have is going to totally collapse.” The event was filmed by AEI, but as of press time is marked “unlisted” on the think tank’s YouTube channel, so that it doesn’t come up in search results. \n“You can make a case that America has been great because every—I think John Adams said this—basically if you are in free society, a capitalist society, after two or three generations of hard work everyone becomes kind of decadent, lazy, spoiled—whatever,” Kristol said. \n“Then, luckily, you have these waves of people coming in from Italy, Ireland, Russia, and now Mexico, who really want to work hard and really want to succeed and really want their kids to live better lives than them and aren’t sort of clipping coupons or hoping that they can hang on and meanwhile grew up as spoiled kids and so forth. In that respect, I don’t know how this moment is that different from the early 20th century,” he added. \nWATCH:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:46:53.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
