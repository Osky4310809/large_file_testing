The photo has recently received quite a bit of attention as online sleuths have been trying to determine which comic had her full and undivided attention. \nThanks to ArkOrb , an eagle-eyed Reddit user, we know that Robbie was flipping through Harley Quinn Vol 3. Kiss Kiss Bang Stab — which collects Harley Quinn (2013) #14-16, ANNUAL #1, Harley Quinn: Holiday Special (2014), and Harley Quinn: Valentine's Day Special (2015). Written by Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti. Art by Chad Hardin, John Timms, Stjepan Sejic, Joe Quinones, Ben Caldwell, Kelley Jones, Aaron Campbell, Darwyn Cooke, Alain Mauricet and Brandt Peters. \nAnd to be even more specific, Robbie was scanning page 34 of the Valentine's Day Special . That story, which is titled “Just Batty Over You,” involves Harley Quinn robbing from a crooked, greedy Wall Street banker and using those funds to win a date with millionaire bachelor Bruce Wayne — who auctioned himself off to raise money for an animal shelter. It features two fun and humorous dream sequences. Harley dreams of being married to Mistah Wayne. It starts off great and lovey dovey, but she literally shoots him down when he tries to convince her to become a one-woman baby-making factory. Bruce also dreams (hallucinates!) of being married to Harley. It too starts off swell (not for Alfred!), but he has to use every trick in the book to keep her content. It's cute! \nIt concludes with Bruce and Harley having a nice, classy dinner date and her stealing a kiss. While she ponders what might be with Mistah Wayne on the rooftop of her apartment, Batman swoops in and gives her some friendly advice. She steals a kiss from him, too, and offers him some friendly advice as well: \"You should do yerself a favor an' take some kissin' lessons from yer millionaire friend some time.\" \nSo, does this mean anything? Maybe, maybe not. Keep in mind, Robbie is one of the producers of the Suicide Squad spinoff, Gotham City Sirens , so it is possible she's looking at material that could find its way into the script being penned by Geneva Robertson-Dworet. \nMargot, Los Angeles havaalanında hayranlarıyla. pic.twitter.com/HoSKUPQR3S", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T12:39:32.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
