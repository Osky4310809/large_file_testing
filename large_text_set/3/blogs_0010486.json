Morton and Carter Page—which just about all of them lied about. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with Kislyak before the election, then again during the transition along with Jared Kushner in Trump Tower—in addition to discussing U.S. sanctions with him over the phone and lying about it. \nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort met with Kislyak’s chief deputy Konstantine Kilimnik, who is Russian-born. Kilimnik has a professed background in Russian intelligence and has along with Manafort worked in support of Putin-backed former Ukrainian dictator Viktor Yanukovych. Later reports by the New York Times of “ intercepted Russian communications ” in all likelihood involve attempts by the FBI and NSA to confirm whether Kilimnik is a current FSB operative . \nBut it’s not just the fact that all these contacts and communications took place, even though the Trump camp lied about it all for months . The smoking gun in this entire scandal may be what the Russians very likely received potentially in exchange for their DNC hack and election interference in opposition to the candidacy of Hillary Clinton, and in favor of Trump. \nThis week Rachel Maddow may have cracked that code. \nIn addition to all the above there’s also this, which I wrote about earlier in the week: \nTrump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen setting up a secret peace deal between Ukraine and Russia to end the sanctions. Rex Tillerson’s $500 Billion ties to Putin. Wilbur Ross’s ties to Putin. Manafort’s ties to Yanakovych, and therefore Putin as well as a former Russian intelligence officer . Trump’s shady business deals with Felix Sater and Bayrock , his links to Russian mobsters , selling a $95 Million mansion at a $60 Million profit to a Russian Oligarch and helping to launder money to Russia’s ally the Iranian Guard with a giant dead Hotel in Azerbaijan . \nHere’s Maddow on the topic: x YouTube Video \nLying about meeting Russians is one thing. But the really strange lie is the one about how and why the RNC platform plank regarding our support for providing weapons to the Ukraine in opposition to pro-Russian violence was suddenly and mysteriously dropped. Initially, Donald Trump and Paul Manafort flatly denied that their campaign had anything to do with it. \nAnd then the truth came out. \nManafort said on NBC’s Meet the Press this past weekend that the change in language on Ukraine “absolutely did not come from the Trump campaign.” \nEric Brakey, a Maine delegate who identifies as a non-interventionist, said he supported the change, which was pushed in part by the Trump campaign. \n“Some staff from the Trump campaign came in and… came back with some language that softened the platform,” Brakey told The Daily Beast. “They didn’t intervene in the platform in most cases. But in that case they had some wisdom to say that maybe we don’t want to be calling… for very, very clear aggressive acts of war against Russia.” \n“They substantively changed it,” added Washington, D.C., delegate Rachel Hoff, who was present during the meeting. “It absolutely was my understanding that it was Trump staff.” \nAccording to two Republican delegates,the Trump campaign’s efforts were led in part by J.D. Gordon, a Trump campaign official and a former spokesman at the Pentagon. \nSo they did change the platform in a way that very specifically benefited Russia. And the person who personally implemented the change was J.D. Gordon, one of the three Trump associates, along with Trump himself, who had met personally with Kislyak at the convention. \nAnd who had decided to make this change? According to what we know now, Trump did. And all of them lied about it. \nIn January , Gordon told Business Insider that he \"never left\" his \"assigned side table\" nor spoke publicly at the GOP national security subcommittee meeting, where the amendment — which originally called for \"providing lethal defense weapons\" to the Ukrainian army to fend off Russian-backed separatists — was read aloud, debated, and ultimately watered down to \"providing appropriate assistance\" to Ukraine. \nAccording to CNN's Jim Acosta, however, Gordon said that at the RNC he and others \"advocated for the GOP platform to include language against arming Ukrainians against pro-Russian rebels\" because \"this was in line with Trump's views, expressed at a March national security meeting at the unfinished Trump hotel\" in Washington, DC. \nIs it possible this is all merely circumstantial? Is it just a coincidence that Manafort’s favorite Russian made a specific trip to the U.S. to meet with him and advocate for this change in the RNC platform? Is this something that Trump wanted anyway on his own, without being lobbied by Kilimnik or Manafort? \nIf so, then exactly why did they all lie about it so profusely? \nThe answer to that may link back to something that was claimed in the so-called Steele dossier , which has been gradually proven more and more credible . The dossier alleged that this change in the platform was arranged as payback for Russia helping the Trump campaign. Segment from Steele Dossier on Russia and Trump \n“Other issues where the Kremlin was looking to shift the US policy consensus were Ukraine and Syria. “ \nUkraine was a priority for the Kremlin. Then somehow during the RNC, after meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, it suddenly became a priority for Trump. And then they lied about for it months. \nThere is a thing in law enforcement known as “consciousness of guilt.” It’s the way that people behave when they have something to hide, when they know something they don’t want you to know because if you knew that thing, you would realize that they’ve done something bad. Really bad. \nPerhaps they’ve sold our country out to the Kremlin. \nAnd as Rachel Maddow described in her “B Block,” they may not have stopped yet. The Trump administration appears to be hollowing out the State Department with a giant purge of their institutional knowledge. x", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T04:13:19.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
