Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 \nThe Obama administration was planning to send 18 more detainees to other countries before Trump takes the oath of office. That would reduce the prison population even more, and potentially release more dangerous terrorists into the world.

Assuming this latest transfer goes through, there would only be about 40 inmates left in custody, The Hill reported. \nPolitico noted that Trump was unlikely to close the prison camp. Throughout his campaign, Trump promised to do what needed to be done to terrorists, and at one point said that he would “load (Gitmo) up with some bad dudes.” \nThe people who are in Gitmo are some of the most deadly terrorists alive — not exactly the sort of people you want to transfer around and potentially release into the world. Hopefully Trump will follow through on his campaign promise and use Gitmo to house terrorists, not try to close it down as a political stunt like Obama has tried to do.
