I think it should be played here, Washington, Atlanta. That's where the tournament should be played. … . @AdamZagoria @ACCSports We kindly disagree. But I guess you can lose in the 1st round anywhere. At least it's a quick ride home. — City of Greensboro (@greensborocity) March 8, 2017 \n\"There's no value in playing Greensboro, none. It's there because the league's been there and the office is there, and they have 150 people that the ACC needs. That's why it's there. It should not be there. \n\"You get in the media centers and the recruiting centers, how many players do they have in Greensboro? I mean, New York, Washington, Atlanta, that's where the media centers are. Madison Square Garden made the Big East conference. There's a couple other factors, but made the Big East conference. \n\"I'm saying all that because I don't give a (expletive). I'm just saying what's right. That's what's right. Why do you think the Big Ten is coming into New York? It's business, good business sense. They all say it's a business. Well, then, let's start acting like it's a business.\" \nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL HIGHLIGHTS Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
