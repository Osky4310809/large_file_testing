Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insists his side must keep working hard to get their Premier League title challenge back on track \n\"Against a team like Tottenham, we need everything. If we play like we did in first half against Hull - no chance. If we play like we did in that second half then (we have a) better chance, but we want better.\" \nLiverpool slipped to fifth in the Premier League table after their 2-0 defeat to Hull last weekend, leaving them four points behind Tottenham ahead of their match at Anfield. \n\"I don't think too much about other teams,\" Klopp added. \"Things like this (Tottenham's good run) happen. Liverpool lost 2-0 last time out at Hull City \n\"It [Liverpool's top six record] should be better, remember that offside goal against Man United? \n\"We don't look for excuses, we look for solutions. Just because you aren't flying, it doesn't mean you can't win next game. \n\"We are still convinced that this is a long-term project. The players learn but it's my job to bring them into the right situation. \n\"I don't question everything ( after a defeat). Everything is easier when you win a game but the jobs is still the same to do (no matter the result).\" Klopp has cut a frustrated figure in recent weeks \nSpurs travel to Anfield in flying form having gone 10 matches unbeaten in all competitions following last week's 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough at White Hart Lane. \nDele Alli also heads into the fixture fresh from picking up the Premier League player of the month award for January on Friday, having scored five goals during the month as Tottenham rose to second in the league. \nKlopp confirmed ahead of the match-up that Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Ragnar Klavan were all doubts with a knee knock, achilles issue and bacterial infection respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:36:48.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
