Their conversation had been so hostile that it ended about a half hour short, according to reports. \nMore recently, the president's conversation with Russia's Vladimir Putin made its way to the media, with reports claiming Trump had to pause during the call because he was not fully versed on the START treaty. White House Press Secretary refuted that accusation, noting he was only asking his staff for their opinions. \nFollowing the fallout, Trump told Fox News he suspects \"Obama people\" still working in the White House were responsible for the leaks. \nThe White House is going to test that theory in an investigation . \n“We’re looking into the situation, yes, and it’s very concerning,” press secretary Sean Spicer said when asked about the leaks. “Some of them are done in a way that the release of that information is clearly a breach of a lot of protocols and laws.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T16:58:04.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
