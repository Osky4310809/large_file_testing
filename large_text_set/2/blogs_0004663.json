He is the source of I'm A Chatterbox, winner of three Grade 1 races and third in the Kentucky Oaks. \nBred by Stonestreet Thoroughbred Holdings, Lady Aurelia was a seven and a half length winner of her maiden at Keeneland, before the daughter of Scat Daddy travelled to Royal Ascot for the Group 2 Queen Mary Stakes, when she surged clear of the opposition by seven lengths. \nThe Wesley Ward-trained filly then took the Prix Morny at Deauville before finding Brave Anna and Roly Poly too good on firmer ground in the Cheveley Park Stakes. \nJohn Moynihan, bloodstock consultant for Stonestreet Farm, said: \"We chose Munnings because we feel he's a young, upcoming stallion. \n\"We were very happy and proud with Lady Aurelia's performances and awards. She has just gone back into training after her winter break and we are aiming for a return to Europe this Spring.\" \nD'Wildcat Speed forms part of the 100-strong broodmare band at Stonestreet Farm which founded by Jess Stonestreet Jackson in Kentucky. Among the other exciting matings planned are a trio of mares that will go to Curlin. \nThey include Bounding , winner of the Group 1 Railway Stakes and runner-up in the 1,000 Guineas in New Zealand, who was bought as a broodmare prospect by Stonestreet for A$1,900,000 at the Magic Millions National Broodmare Sale in June 2016, and Rachel's Valentina, winner of the Grade 1 Spinaway Stakes at Saratoga and runner-up in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. Both mares are being covered for the first time. \nStonestreet homebred Dreaming Of Julia will also visit the Dubai World Cup scorer, after she gives birth to her foal by Medaglia D'Oro. \nTwo mares who visited Medaglia D'Oro last year are the homebred My Miss Aurelia who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 2011 and was runner-up in the Ladies' Classic a year later, and Dayatthespa, winner of the Breeder's Cup Filly and Mare Turf in 2014. Both mares will go to Tapit this year. Dayatthespa already has a yearling filly by Curlin. \nMedaglia D'Oro has also been chosen to cover for the maiden Tara's Tango , a homebred winner of the Grade 1 Santa Margarita Stakes and fourth in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Sprint in November, and also Hillaby , winner of the Grade 2 Bessarabian Stakes at Woodbine and who is currently in foal to Malibu Moon. \n\"We are committed to breeding and raising the best racehorses and a facet of this is breeding to proven, commercial sires,\" said Moynihan. \n\"We are particular fans of Curlin who is doing phenomenally at stud; he will see some of our best mares.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:07:37.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
