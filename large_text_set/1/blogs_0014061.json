CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ \nLabour Deputty Leader Annette King and the front runner to replace her in the Rongotai seat, Wellington Deputy Mayor Paul Eagle. \nREAD MORE: * Labour leader sticking with Annette King for deputy \nHe formally told his fellow MPs of his decision on Monday at a caucus retreat in the Wairarapa. \n\"I've told them I will be a list-only candidate. I'm not seeking nomination or selection for any seat,\" Little said. \n\"Leading a general election campaign I need the flexibility I have had for the last two years of being able to be, in effect, anywhere anytime.\" \nAt the leadership level you were \"MP for the whole of New Zealand\" and that was the way he saw the job. \nLittle believed he could have won Rongotai, with hard work. \nBut he appeared much less confident in New Plymouth saying the challenge would have been to campaign while he was also running a nationwide campaign. \nHe said his energy and focus had to be on the country-wide campaign. The roles of leader, deputy and finance required a focus on the needs of that office rather than being tied to a particular electorate, Little said.. \nFinance Spokesman Grant Robertson \"fortunately\" had a seat in the capital - the Wellington Central seat. \nLittle said Eagle, who has confirmed he is considering contesting Rongotai, was the leading contender, though Little said he did not know who else might be interested. . \nEagle, 44, was appointed Wellington deputy mayor when Justin Lester won the mayoralty in October. \nHe had won council elections, organised well, and was a very strong identity with good connections in the area. \n\"He has got everything you would need for a good, effective MP,\" Little said. \nKing, who held the seat with a majority of more than 9000 in 2014, intends to stand as a list-only candidate in this year's general election. \nLittle said he had been waiting for King's announcement to be tied down before making his call. \nRongotai members had asked him to consider standing, but after giving it a couple of days' thought he decided to stay with his view he should remain a list MP. \nHe had told his New Plymouth electorate committee last year that he would not stand there. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T08:07:31.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
