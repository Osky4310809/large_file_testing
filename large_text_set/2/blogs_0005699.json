Nick Jr. has just introduced Nella the Princess Knight, a new animated character of mixed race and big plans. Nella was created specifically to shatter stereotypes, Nickelodeon Group President Cyma Zarghami explained to PEOPLE . “This is hopefully representative of what our country actually does look like,” said Zarghami. “I think that we are telling authentic stories about real kids and real families — even though they’re animated and fantasy-based. We’re really trying to reflect what kids see every day… real kids who look like you and me.” As a modern princess, Nella doesn’t need a prince to rescue her. The trailer gives equal weight to Nella’s princess-perfect “beautiful gown and sparkly tiara” and her sword and suit of armor. “Girl empowerment is really a part of Nickelodeon’s DNA, so a girl who transforms into a knight to save the day sounds exactly in line with what we believe is our mission,” Zarghami explained. The show seems to seek the blessing of families who may be concerned about the role princess media can play in reinforcing gender stereotypes. Last June, a Brigham Young University study of 198 preschoolers confirmed that engaging with princess media and toys at a young age can lead to self-critical behavior and gender stereotyping. Parents spoke out about a fear that the stereotypes would hold their daughters back from experimenting with math and science, or even playing outside and getting messy. From what we can see so far of Nella, she’s unafraid of pursuing her goals — although we still have yet to see a princess who fights crime, cares about fashion, and majored in STEM. A “Princess Knight” may be the solution for parents who want to teach their children without denying them the joys of a royal lifestyle. Even Akira Golz, the 12-year-old actress who voices Nella, has learned from her alter-ego. “Nella’s a great person, she’s always super sweet and has a lot of confidence,” said Golz. “I feel like ever since I started Nella, I feel like I’ve been a little bit more outgoing and little bit more confident in myself just from seeing all the things she’s done.” Let’s keep in touch!
