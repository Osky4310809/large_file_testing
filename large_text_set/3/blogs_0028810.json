Take for instance this dreamy, blush-pink gown that seems to float on air, modeled here by supermodel Natalia Vodianova, the face of the label's 2017 collection.

The very same plastic that's polluting our beach ecosystems was put to use to create a new sustainable polyester, called Bionic, used throughout the newest Conscious lineup. Launching in stores and online April 20, you can expect a full assortment of men's and women's casual- and formalwear, as well as kids' clothes and fragrance, available for the first time.\nRead on for a first look at the gown in all its glory, or, as I like to think of it, the mind-blowing future of fashion.\nPrevious Next", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:08:52.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
