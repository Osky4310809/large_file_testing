(Elizabeth Zach/For The Washington Post) “While traveling a few months back, I ended up chatting with a divorce attorney, who observed that what we’re seeing in America right now bears a startling resemblance to what he sees happen with many of his clients,” my friend Megan McArdle wrote in a pre-New Year’s column . “They’ve lost sight of what they ever liked about each other; in fact, they’ve even lost sight of their own self-interest. All they can see is their grievances, from annoying habits to serious wrongs.”\nThe bitterness she’s describing is expressed broadly in partisan contempt and disagreement on major issues , and more specifically in efforts like the attempt to get a secession ballot measure in front of California voters as early as 2018 . And while I’ll have a lot of writing to do about the new administration’s policies and style in the years to come, I thought I’d start 2017 on a positive note, by reminding all of you and myself of a few of the things that I love about this huge, fractious, complicated country that all of us share.\nAs a critic, I love that Americans took the miseries of racial discrimination, the great migrations of African Americans and residents of Appalachia, and the close quarters of the South Bronx and turned those experiences into the blues, jazz, country music, rock-and-roll and hip-hop. The capacity to transform suffering and dislocation into transcendent art isn’t solely an American trait. But the specific ways Americans have found to speak to these experiences and the ways those new musical forms have resonated around the world are something I try not to take for granted. And though I’m not Christian, the choral music at the churches I’ve been privileged to visit is a gift all its own.\nI also love to eat, and America’s culinary traditions are a marvel. My husband and I have been making an effort to see cities neither of us visited as children, and getting to eat the food made by cooks and chefs in Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga., has been a delight. Next up for me this year is Nashville — readers, send recommendations. And one of the greatest things about living in Washington is the sheer number of restaurants devoted to food from different countries and regions: Lapis in Adams Morgan helped introduce me to Afghan cooking and without the Dabney , I probably would never have eaten sugar toads, a fish native to nearby waters .\nAs a neighbor, I appreciate America’s entrepreneurial spirit — and my fellow citizens’ generosity. For all the headlines about political animosity and high-profile incidents of ugly bias and basic unkindness, the United States actually ranks pretty well on the Charities Aid Foundation’s annual World Giving Index. In 2016, the United States came in second , based on three factors: 73 percent of us reported helping a stranger, 63 percent of us donated money, and 46 percent of us volunteered.\nKindness and charitable donations can’t alone make up for systemic bias or gaps in the social safety net. But in a country as big and varied as the United States, where our motivations for doing good stem from a huge range of different religions, personal philosophies and interests, there’s something moving about the fact that these different impetuses lead us to a common conviction to do good. (Tiny Myanmar, which is 88 percent Buddhist, was the only country to beat us in the index.) The number of us who came to the aid of people we didn’t know fell three percentage points between 2015 and 2016; perhaps a simple New Year’s resolution many of us could make would be to step up when we see the opportunity.\nBeyond the character and creativity of my fellow Americans, I was lucky enough to be raised by parents who loved walking in America’s national parks, which means that I grew up with an intense awareness of just how beautiful the United States is. From Arches National Park in Utah to Crater Lake in Oregon, from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Teton Range in Wyoming, and from Saguaro National Park in Arizona to Skyline Drive in Virginia, the variety of American landscapes, and the work Americans do on the land and to preserve the land, is remarkable. Simply getting to see the country’s visual splendor is an amazing experience. Getting to live in a country that’s shaped both by a history of national abundance and by disasters such as the Dust Bowl and Hurricane Katrina provides a rare perspective.\nYes, I know, this is all hopelessly corny. But remembering what’s great about the United States has never precluded acknowledging the country’s sins, flaws and continued challenges. If we were a series of smaller, more ideologically consistent countries, we might be more comfortable or at least less frustrated with each other. The cost would be the friction and fractures that have produced so much of our greatness, and the scope that give us our grandness. The marriage that produced America may be struggling. As always, it’s worth the fight to preserve it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:44:42.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
