However, Fraser has quite an impressive body of work, including Zero Dark Thirty, Killing Them Softly, and Foxcatcher . \nPerhaps the most exciting DP to win in one of the TV categories, though, was Tod Campbell for his work on Mr. Robot . Campbell, who also worked on Stranger Things, as well as Richard Linklater's 12-year epic Boyhood, has been generating quite a lot of buzz for his work on the show, namely for his unusual approach to composition and framing . \nCheck out the full list of winners below: Theatrical Release Greig Fraser, ASC, ACS, Lion [WINNER] James Laxton, Moonlight Rodrigo Prieto, ASC, AMC, Silence Linus Sandgren, FSF, La La Land Bradford Young, ASC, Arrival Television Movie, Miniseries or Pilot Balazs Bolygo, HSC, BSC, for Harley and the Davidsons - “Amazing Machine” Paul Cameron, ASC for Westworld - “The Original” Jim Denault, ASC for All The Way Alex Disenhof for The Exorcist - “Chapter One: And Let My Cry Come Unto Thee” Igor Martinovic for The Night Of - “Subtle Beast” [WINNER] The Night Of - “Subtle Beast” Regular Series for Non-Commercial Television John Conroy for Penny Dreadful - “The Day Tennyson Died” David M.
