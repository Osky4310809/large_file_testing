Theresa May must grow a backbone, she needs to show strong and reasoned opposition in the face of draconian policies.”\nThe MSP added: “While Trump is playing these fascist games, he will have no comfort in this country. The last time he visited, Scotland treated him with a healthy irreverence. We are a polite people, but a firm people, and we would show our resistance. We see no Scottish values in the actions of Donald Trump.”\nView this image ›\nAnti-Trump protesters take to the streets of Edinburgh, Scotland.

I find it obscene, and we have to come together in protest. We will stand up to this, his fascism is not welcome here.”\nShe added: “He would face huge opposition if he tried to come here. I’d be interested to see how the security infrastructure were mobilised to either support a peaceful protest or squash our right to protest. Regardless, I will be there with many many others if he sets foot in Scotland.”\nView this image ›\nJames Chapelard / SWNS / BuzzFeed News\nID: 10428802 View this image ›\nJames Chapelard / SWNS / BuzzFeed News\nID: 10428792 View this image ›\nJames Chapelard / SWNS / BuzzFeed News\nID: 10428807 The peaceful protest marched roughly a mile from The Mound in Edinburgh’s city centre to Holyrood where the devolved Scottish parliament meets, although the grounds of the parliament struggled to hold the huge numbers of protesters.\nAt the parliament, there were further speeches from the cross-party Scotland Against Trump group, including from a member of Labour’s national executive committee and the chairperson of Scottish Labour’s Young Socialists, Rhea Wolfson.\n“I’m here for three reasons; the first is to say to Donald Trump that the world is watching you, we see what you’re doing and we stand with those who you are hurting,” said Wolfson. “The second is to show that we stand with our brothers and sisters internationally, and the third is to call on Theresa May to stop enabling Trump and this administration. She is shaming us, herself, and Britain.”\nWolfson added: “There would be a very hostile reaction if Trump tried to visit Scotland. It would be the same across Britain – people would be up in arms and that would be the right reaction.”\nView this image ›\nID: 10428858 An MSP from Scotland’s governing party, the SNP, told BuzzFeed News he had been speaking to representatives from Edinburgh’s Muslim community who had told him they were heartened by the support they were getting from the locals.\n“This was organised in 24 hours and it’s astonishing how many people have come out on a cold Monday night to say this is wrong,” said Ben Macpherson. “Trump needs to reflect that this executive order is an act of discrimination and the world will not sit by and say this is tolerable.\n“This is wrong.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:13:21.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
