Assange then said that after the revelation, an anti-virus expert approached WikiLeaks to say that attacks previously blamed on Russia, China and Iran have now been pinned on the CIA. \n“The technology is designed to be unaccountable, it’s designed to be untraceable, it’s designed to hide itself. It’s designed to throw off people looking to see where there are fingerprints that might demonstrate who authored that technology,\" Assange explained. \n“We have quite a lot more material that talks about these attempts to throw off attribution to discover who is actually behind a particular cyberattack,” the Australian said, hinting at further revelations to come in future ‘Vault 7’ WikiLeaks releases. \nREAD MORE: Amazon Echo shuts down over CIA connection query (VIDEO) \n“Already an anti-virus expert has come forward to say that sophisticated malware that he had attributed to a state, either Iran, China or Russia, now he believes is from the CIA because the type of attack system it uses corresponds directly to a description we published of that attack system.” \n“And it’s rare enough that it seems unlikely that it would be independently discovered, unless of course China has already gotten hold of these parts of the CIA arsenal and that China is using them to pretend to be the CIA.” — RT (@RT_com) March 8, 2017 \nThe WikiLeaks founder also warned that because the technology hides its origin its completely open to being abused without consequences. \n“There’s absolutely nothing to stop a random CIA officer, or contractor, or liaison agent working for the British, using that technology against whoever they like for whatever reasons they like,” he warned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T22:32:58.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
