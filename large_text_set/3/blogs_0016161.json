She’s lost 115 pounds already, but when she posted a celebratory side-by-side photo of her weight loss, Instagram deleted it — without explaining why. The two pictures featured Morgan in a bikini, so it’s not like she was naked or showing anything inappropriate. The whole thing is pretty baffling.\nMorgan posted an original of the weight loss photo again a few days ago, saying she’s (rightfully) disappointed in the fact that somebody went through the effort to report the picture and have it removed from Instagram. On the left she weighed 286 pounds, and on the right she’s 172 pounds.\nSomebody took their time to report this photo and have it deleted. I think it sucks that people express negativity toward something with only positive intentions, BUT that's why we peeps full of love and light get to make a difference✨ Never let worldly pessimism or judgement prevent you from living your life and celebrating what you've done with it. So yeah, I've lost over 110 pounds and I think I look pretty freakin bomb in a bathing suit on the beach, and that's after a lifetime of letting insecurities hold me back from experiencing life. Yes I'll continue to wear a full face of makeup to the beach and yes, I'll continue to be DAMN proud of who I've worked so hard to become✌ #teamlosing Both from @torridfashion \nA post shared by Morgan Bartley (@morganlosing) on Mar 16, 2017 at 1:43pm PDT \nIn the caption, Morgan encouraged everyone by saying, “Never let worldly pessimism or judgement prevent you from living your life and celebrating what you’ve done with it.” She made it clear that she’s not backing down anytime soon, because she’s come a long way and she’s proud of herself.\n“I’ve lost over 110 pounds and I think I look pretty freakin bomb in a bathing suit on the beach, and that’s after a lifetime of letting insecurities hold me back from experiencing life,” Morgan wrote. To say Morgan and her weight loss journey is an inspiration would be an understatement. When she was 17, she weighed 300 pounds and had been diagnosed with ovarian torsion, which resulted in the loss of an ovary, menopausal symptoms, and the inability to conceive.\nBoth candids, but when I first saw the left photo I was absolutely mortified. The second one made me smile. Mostly because of what a dork I am, but also because that's a genuine smile on my face Investing in ME is the best decision I've ever made #TeamLosingDietBet starts TOMORROW y'all We're using the day to meal prep and get ready for the week over here in the #teamlosing casa What are you doing to set yourself up for success? Remember, failing to plan is planning to fail! #beforeandduring \nA post shared by Morgan Bartley (@morganlosing) on Feb 26, 2017 at 1:37pm PST \nMorgan took her fate into her own hands. She started going to therapy, changed her eating habits, and exercised more. She also took part in a weight loss surgery that removed 80 percent of her stomach. Now she’s doing better than ever and is loving her body.\n\"Hard work has a future payoff. Laziness pays off now.\" Your choice✌ #HighOnLife #teamlosing \nA post shared by Morgan Bartley (@morganlosing) on Feb 11, 2017 at 3:10pm PST \nWhy her photo was taken down from Instagram still remains unclear, but Morgan isn’t going to let that stop her from continuing on her weight loss journey (she wants to lose 30 more pounds). There are thousands of people who have been inspired to get their health on track as a result of her bravery, so we hope to see lots more from this incredible woman.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:48:42.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
