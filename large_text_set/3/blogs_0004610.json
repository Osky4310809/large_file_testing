China’s Premier Li \nIt burned through nearly 320 billion dollars of reserves last year, but the yuan still fell 6.6 per cent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994. \nThe yuan has steadied in recent weeks as the dollar’s rally lost steam. The Chinese currency gained 0.2 per cent in February, and is up 0.8 per cent so far in 2017. \nHowever, expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes beginning as early as next week have rekindled fears that the yuan could come under renewed pressure. \nThe prospect of the yuan depreciating could inflame trade tensions with the U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. \nChina’s gold reserves rose to 74.376 billion dollars at the end of February from 71.292 billion dollars at end-January, data published on the People’s Bank of China website showed.
