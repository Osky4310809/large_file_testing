Photos \nRenewed or Canceled? Find Out the Fate of All Your Favorite Shows \nAside from Kate's devastasting breakthrough, tonight's episode also brought us one other unexpected twist. \nTurns out, Kevin's not in love with either Sloan or Olivia, and is actually still in love with the wife he divorced 12 years ago, who also happens to be Kate's best childhood friend, Sophie ( Alexandra Breckenridge ). He showed up at her door and gave an adorable speech, complete with commas and other punctuation. \nThis is the same Sophie who attended the kids' three separate birthday parties, and who eventually ditched Kate's Madonna party for Kevin's Princess Bride theme, and who Kevin admitted his love for, even then. \nJust when we had relegated Kevin to the bottom of our list of favorite Pearsons, he goes and does something cute like that. Now he's back to being tied with everyone else again! \nWhat did you guys think? Sound off in the comments! \nThis Is Us airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on NBC. \n(E! and NBC are both part of the NBC Universal family.)
