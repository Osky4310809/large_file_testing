SHARES \n80,000 hours . That is how long you can expect work over the course of your lifetime. I'm well on my way, approaching the 35,000-hour mark by now. \nI've done my fair share of work. First in the accounting department of an airline (not awesome). Then at an investment bank (surprisingly boring). Finally, I spent about 14 years at Microsoft Corporation (great place to work). Now I'm an entrepreneur (ahhh…finally!). \nMore from Ravi Raman: \nOver the years, I've learned a lot about how work can impact life and vice versa. I've seen what helps me get ahead and what holds me back. \nI've learned what to do. I've learned what not to do! \nIf I could turn back time, there are plenty of things I would have done differently. Here are 12 things I wish I knew when I first started working: \n1) Be an outstanding communicator \nIf you can't communicate, it's like winking at a girl in the dark. - Warren Buffett \nLots of people are smart. \nIf you made it to a career at a reputable company (or have the guts to start your own), chances are you are smart too. Being smart isn't enough. Your ability to communicate is a massive factor in your career success. The top people in a company are rarely the smartest. They are the smartest that also know how to present themselves well. \nLearn how to communicate — through writing and performing. Find out how to introduce complex ideas and arguments. Don't fear negative feedback. Keep refining the skill. \nNot sure where to start? Join Toastmasters , or even better, volunteer a toast at the next wedding you attend (I did this twice last year!). Pitch an idea for a local Ignite or TED -style gathering (I've also done this). There are countless opportunities to practice and improve your communication skill. show chapters Friday, 3 Feb 2017 | 11:13 AM ET | 01:33 \n2) Don't let perfect get in the way of great \n\"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good\" - Similar statements attributed to Shakespeare, Voltaire and Confucius \nAuthor and management consultant Geoffrey Moore has a phrase, \"Go ugly early.\" It's directed at innovators trying to make products that can jump across the chasm that separates winners from losers. In the technology industry, an MVP or Minimum Viable Product is often an initial stop in the quest for product/market/fit. An MVP is a way to get a product out the door, gather feedback, and perfect it over time. \nWhatever you are doing, strive to be great, but the first step is getting out there and making something happen. Learn from the experience. \n3) Get strong \n\"You can be anything you want … but you must be strong first.\" -Pavel Tsatsouline \nGet in the weight room. Do some deadlifts. Swing a kettlebell and build some strength (kettlebells have a \" What the Hell? \" effect). Not into weights? Confused about why I would include this in a list of work-related advice? \nAll the hours sitting at work will take its toll on your body. Exercise is the antidote. The added muscle will be a major confidence booster at work. The hormonal response of hard workouts will also help you cope with work-related stress. Stress can derail the brightest of careers if not kept in check. \nLifting heavy weights will force you to learn proper form and posture (or you will get injured). Strength will help you stave off repetitive stress injury. Strength workouts are also proven to provide significant cardiovascular benefits associated with endurance sports. \nHire a trainer to teach you the basics of Olympic and power lifting techniques. Commit to getting strong and witness the positive spillover effect at work. Executive career coach. Ravi Raman. \n4) Learn how to set boundaries \n\"Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves, even when we risk disappointing others.\" - Brene Brown \nThere is an infinite amount of work to do. \nLearn to stop tasks and projects even if they aren't complete so you can leave work on time. Don't check your email after hours or on weekends. Avoid multitasking (it's a myth anyway). Work hard when you need to and cultivate the discernment to know when to shut work off. \nBuild this habit early in your career, and it can help you get more done in less time, save your relationships and keep you sane. \n5) Become an early riser \nBen Franklin wasn't joking when he said: \"Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\" \nI don't care if you think you are a night owl. You can learn any habit, including the habit of being an early riser . I have yet to meet a productive and successful person who does not have an early start to her day. \nStrive to join the 5 AM Club , or at least the 6 AM Club! You will be more productive and able to work in peace without the demands of the world creeping in. \nPro Tip: If you want to wake up earlier, go to bed earlier!

It can mean the difference between retiring with financial freedom and just scraping by in your golden years. \nThe reason I was able to quit my job and travel the world for 18 months was due to a long history of saving and investing since I was a teenager. I learned the basics of investing by watching my dad. I learned the merits of frugality from my entire extended family (a family of immigrants). These habits resulted in a financial cushion as both my wife and I embarked on our entrepreneurial journeys two years ago. \nWhat does this mean for you? \nLearn the law of compounding returns. Learn the benefits of low-cost index fund investing . Invest as much money as possible early in your career. Learn tax law and the tax-related benefits of starting a business even if you have a day job. In 10–20 years, if done right, you will find yourself in a position of being able to retire early (in your 30s or 40s) if you want to. \nIf you are in debt, that is a whole different ball of wax. Follow Dave's advice, build a \" debt snowball ,\" and get back control of your life. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:06:15.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
