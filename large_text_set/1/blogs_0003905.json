The African sand cat cross Credit: Eddie Mulholland \nThis sand cat cross was created by breeders Jacky and Tim Bliss crossing a wild sand cat with a British crossbreed. \nT here are 20 Marguerites now, all descended from Trevor the wild cat. \nMrs Bliss, 63, told the Evening Standard: “This is the first time an African sand cat hybrid has been seen at a public show in the world because this is the first time a successful breeding programme has been completed. The LondonCats show is full of rare and beautiful felines Credit: Eddie Mulholland \n“The two kittens and cat we are bringing to the LondonCats show are second and third-generation hybrids, whereas other sand cat offspring have died.” \nS he said sand cats are “different to those more aggressive wild cats. Sand cats lie flat and hide if they are scared, they don’t attack, and they’re not hyperactive. We are trying to keep those traits in the hybrid domestic cat offspring and they are so sweet-natured.” \nThe LondonCats show is known as the 'Crufts for cats' and it's backed by the International Cat Association.
