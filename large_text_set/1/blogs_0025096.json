It also covers any new data generated by the EPA, including data that was regularly and routinely passed along to other agencies and the public in the past under the theory that government works for the people. \nAs with so many actions of the Trump regime, there has been an attempt to normalize this suppression as something that happens with every transition. However ... \nFormer EPA staffers under both Republican and Democratic presidents said the restrictions imposed under Trump far exceed the practices of past administration. \nAnd just in case you thought that public attention had made safe the EPA web pages that provide both an overview of climate change and access to the agency’s store of data. \nEricksen said no decisions have yet been made about whether to strip mentions of climate change from epa.gov \nThe political screen is being applied to everything , including data used to apprise the public of health risks and determine the effectiveness of clean up efforts. \nAsked specifically about scientific data being collected by agency scientists, such as routine monitoring of air and water pollution, Ericksen responded, \"Everything is subject to review.\" \nDuring the Soviet era, the USSR routinely suppressed research into some areas and scientific publications were subject to political review both to limit the available information and make sure that any published data aligned with official policies of the state. Information on areas as diverse as evolution and quantum physics was either banned outright, or altered to fit a more “ideal” version. \nIn the United States, the Independence of scientists has long been a source of pride. Until now ... \nWilliam K. Reilly, who was EPA administrator under Republican President George H.W. Bush, said what seems to be happening with science at the agency is \"going down a very dark road.\" \nHowever, just because the agency isn’t allowed to provide data, doesn’t mean that big changes in regulations can’t be made. \nThe agency also took a potential first step Tuesday toward killing environmental rules completed as President Barack Obama's term wound down. At least 30 were targeted in the Federal Register for delayed implementation, including updated pollution rulings for several states, renewable fuel standards and limits on the amount of formaldehyde that can leach from wood products. \nIf no one measures the formaldehyde is it still highly toxic to all animals? Of course not, comrade. Of course not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T02:10:20.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
