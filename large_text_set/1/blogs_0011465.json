Scott Rogowsky of the YouTube series “Running Late” has gone viral for his latest video showing him reading outrageous fake books on a subway. These books poke fun at Trump and other ridiculous conservatives associated with him. My favorites included: “Mike Pence’s Prejudice & Prejudice” as well as “Fantastic Nukes and Where to Drop Them.” \nThe best part of all this is that all the ad revenue Rogowsky gets from his viral video go to support Planned Parenthood and the ACLU.
