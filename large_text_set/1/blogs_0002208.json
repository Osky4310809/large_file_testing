Three years later, the former sweethearts have picked up where they left off and have brought back the magic with their upcoming romantic film ‘Ok Jaanu’. The makers of the film teased fans with a new still of the two stars ‘almost’ locking lips. Now, isn’t this cute and hot at the same time? ‘Ok Jaanu’ hits theatres on January 13, 2017. The film that has been directed by Shaad Ali, is a remake of the Tamil movie ‘OK Kanmani’ which starred Dulquer Salmaan and Nithya Menen in the lead roles. Music maestro AR Rahman will head behind the consoles once again for this re-make as he did in the Tamil original. Can we now expect to see a teaser anytime soon? Guess we’ll have to wait to find out. All Comments ()", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T07:47:38.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
