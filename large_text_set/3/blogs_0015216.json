I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future. As you probably heard, I disinvited him from my first congressional district GOP event this weekend—a thing I do every year. And I’m not going to be campaigning with him over the next 30 days.”     \nRyan’s clear intention not to support Trump “not now, not in the future” in 2016 raises eyebrows today as the two struggle to pass an Obamacare replacement bill that has not been as popular among Conservatives as Trump possibly may have lead to believe it would be by Ryan. \nAccording to Breitbart, [Ryancare] “is the first major initiative that Trump has worked on with Ryan—and the fact it is going so poorly calls into question whether Speaker Ryan, the GOP’s failed 2012 vice presidential nominee who barely supported Trump at all in 2016, really understands how Trump won and how to win in general.” \nSo now Ryan has Trump supporters mad at him as well as conservatives who see the new health care law as too much government. From Conservative Review : \nNow, Ryan is warning conservatives that this is the only way forward. He insists on full subsidies for pre-existing conditions. Tell me how much that government-run health care will cost.   \nAnd now Paul Ryan is concerned that if his bill doesn’t pass, that his party will face a bloodbath in 2018. Everything is put on the line because Paul Ryan cannot stick to his principles, and instead has bastardized all notion of the free market in this bill. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nI would suggest Paul Ryan 2017 listen to Paul Ryan 2009, and remember that the people didn’t want government-run health care, and that he himself argued vociferously against it. It is a shame that he has spent all his political capital on this bill, when all he had to do is stick to principle to avoid the ire of the people.  3'); }); \nRyan continues to talk his way into circles to push this bill, but he and his RINO cheerleaders are only losing their morality the longer they stay in office. Sure the Tea Party and conservatives have tried to keep them honest, and at times tried to replace them, but this exercise has been repeated so many times that it is clear that the more Republican voters give the Republican Party, the more the Republican Party rejects its voters. \nIt must be pretty lonely to be Paul Ryan these days. What do you think? Is this new health care law what America needs? Or, is it more big government Obamacare-lite?
