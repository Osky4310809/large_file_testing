On The Bachelor: Countdown to Nick , Chris Harrison promised Nick Viall ’s upcoming season of The Bachelor will be “unlike anything you’ve ever seen before.” The ABC special, which was sprinkled with well-wishes from fellow franchise alums (including a message from Josh Murray promising not to show up and steal any of his girls — no hard feelings), featured a sneak peek into Nick’s upcoming season of The Bachelor , plus updates from couples of Bachelors Past. PHOTOS: 'The Bachelor' Season 21: Meet Nick Viall's Bachelorettes! \nAfter a fantastic montage of Nick falling for Andi Dorfman , then being heartbroken by Andi, then falling for Kaitlyn Bristowe , then being heartbroken by Kaitlyn, then falling for Jen Saviano , then breaking Jen’s heart, Nick took center stage as the Bachelor. Finally! Nick Viall and contestants Craig Sjodin/ABC \n… But not without some hesitation from Bachelor Nation. In what could have only been an attempt to knock Nick down a few pegs before taking on the coveted role, producers set him up in a booth where fans lined up to give him a piece of their mind. Most of it wasn’t pretty. One fan (or non-fan) told Nick that her family and friends have always hated him. Another said, “Basically, I just don’t like you,” and Nick heart-wrenchingly agreed that sometimes he doesn’t like himself either. Yet another made fun of his tight pants! We hadn’t noticed his pants before, but we sure will now.

Rosenbaum , Desiree and Chris Siegfried , Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell , Kaitlyn Bristowe and Shawn Booth and Carly Waddell and Evan Bass . \nAshley and J.P. are “living the dream” in Miami with two kids, 2-year-old Fordham and 2-month-old Essex, and a white picket fence. J.P. calls Ashley “super mom” and said he is “finally getting the hang of the whole father thing.” They agree that life is good after over five years together. \nDesiree and Chris are enjoying every moment of their newly acquired parenthood with baby boy Asher Wrigley born this past October, as Us Weekly exclusively announced at the time. Next steps: to grow their family further! \nBen and Lauren are living together and “nesting,” says Lauren. Despite constantly being asked when they’ll get married, the couple sees getting a dog as the next step in their love story.
