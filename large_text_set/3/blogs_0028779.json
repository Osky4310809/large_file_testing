Or at least they didn't for Bones , Fox's longest-running drama, ending Tuesday (9 ET/PT) with just two minor Emmys. But those qualities can earn you devoted fans — the kind who stick by a show through 246 episodes, 12 seasons and almost that many time slots — and a reputation for being a series that knew exactly what was expected from it, and never let its fans down. \nDismiss Bones as a workmanlike \"meat-and-potatoes\" series if you like. But there isn’t a TV outlet in existence that couldn't use — or shouldn't want to have — a show whose dependability never wavered and popularity held steady until near its end. \nOdds are that no one, including Bones creator Hart Hanson, would have guessed when the show premiered that we’d be having this conversation now. Fox's biggest hit back in 2005 was House, and its next big hit was expected to be one of Bones’ classmates, Prison Break — two shows that signaled the network’s shift to more challenging adult dramas. Bones was an anomaly: a procedural that seemed far more suited to CBS, of the CSIs and NCIS, than to Fox. \nSo how did Bones survive on a network that often seemed either to take it for granted or forget it was there? Start with the basic strength of the source material — the book series by Kathy Reichs about a crime-solving forensic anthropologist — and the appeal of stars Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz in roles that were a twist on TV's standard gender norms. From The Thin Man on, detective dramas have usually paired an emotional, intuitive woman with a more rational, thoughtful man. But here, Deschanel's Dr. Temperance Brennan was the rational one, to the point of being unbalanced, while Boreanaz's FBI special agent Seeley Booth was the one who led with his gut and his heart. \nEmily Deschanel, left, and David Boreanaz end Fox's longest-running drama, 'Bones,' after a 12-season run. (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, Fox) \nThe series didn’t waste much time turning them into partners — and then, wisely, took its time turning them into romantic ones . Unlike so many TV pairings, Bones and Booth's relationship was never based on sexual combustibility; it was based on friendship and mutual respect. \nThat’s one reason Bones was able to outlast series like Moonlighting and Castle , which faltered when their will-they/won’t-they tension was resolved. But there’s another reason: Bones never forgot that it was a weekly murder mystery, and that its main job was to tell a decently plotted story every week. Yes, it featured continuing plots, but it never got lost in the weeds. Someone was murdered, and a murderer was caught, in a way that (for the genre) made sense. Can 'Bones' find new life? It's 'always possible' \nIt helps that in addition to two likable stars, the show had a strong and relatively stable supporting cast. TJ Thyne and Michaela Conlin have been with Bones from the start; Tamara Taylor joined in the second season. As is inevitable with long-running series, some actors came and went, but you never got the feeling Bones was a revolving door or, near the end, a sinking ship. \nFans will probably find it fitting, then, that Tuesday's finale focuses on those core characters and their attempt to capture the man who killed Bones' father. Not to mention their attempt to survive the bomb blast that ended last week's outing. \nFor all its success, did Bones advance the medium artistically or change the industry in some way? No. But there's more to TV (and most often, less) than just art. In its presentation of a happily diverse workplace, with an African-American woman in charge and other equally strong women in positions of authority, it spread a subtle social message that can't be discounted. And unlike some more acclaimed series, it spread it to millions of viewers. \nIn my book, that counts as a job well done. 339 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:55:55.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
