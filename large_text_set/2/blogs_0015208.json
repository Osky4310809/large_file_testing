He favors Converse-like sneakers, mirrored aviator sunglasses and a baseball cap. Pals have given him the nickname “Shaggy” for his perfectly messy blond do, which falls into his face with a certain boy-band insouciance.\nCoqui is 11. And a dog.\nThe Maltipoo has also picked up about 9,000 Instagram followers who follow his on-the-street antics: looking cool downtown, hanging with celebs like Wyclef Jean and Michael Bolton, and flouting the law by riding his skateboard on the subway.\nCoqui and his owner Ryan Legrier Ryan Legrier This past Valentine’s Day, a Twitter user shared a snapshot of Coqui and his board on the F train, which went viral. The caption? “The most Brooklyn thing ever.”\nBut, in fact, Coqui and his owner, Ryan Legrier, 31, live in lower Manhattan. “He’s such a good dog,” said Legrier, who’s had the canine since he was a puppy. “He never barks, and he’s laid-back.”\nLegrier, who is currently unemployed, and his sidekick drop by four or five film shoots throughout the city every month, meeting everyone from William H. Macy to Dev Patel and Kathy Griffin.\nCoqui isn’t the most famous skateboarding canine in the world, however. That honor likely belongs to Otto, a bulldog from Lima, Peru, who broke the Guinness World Record for a dog skateboarding through the longest human tunnel. Otto made it past 30 people on Nov. 8, 2015.\nNot to be outdone, Coqui has recently stepped up his game, expanding his transportation options to include a tiny motorized BMW.\n“It’s fun,” Legrier said. “He loves the attention.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:30:43.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
