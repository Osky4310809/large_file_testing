The diminutive point guard is having a career season in Boston, and he keeps one-upping himself — with 52 points last month, followed by 20 points in the fourth quarter earlier this week, and now this game-winner on Friday.\nFOURTH QUARTER AINT FOR EVERYBODY pic.twitter.com/tGSZIJhU8M \n— jack (@jackhaveitall) January 14, 2017 That’s such a tough, fallaway shot against pretty great defense. The Hawks were on a seven-game win streak, but Thomas beat them anyway — and had a hell of a fourth quarter, his final shot aside.\nThe Celtics led 94-87 with three minutes left to play, but four straight three-pointers from Atlanta tied the game. Newly added Mike Dunleavy nailed one with 2:12 in the game, and then this sequence happened.\nYou see Thomas matching one of those threes, and he had a 15-footer with 1:19 left in the game, too. His nine points in the final 3:20 (and 13 overall in the fourth) was crucial. On the final play, it was all him, too.\nStevens said Isaiah Thomas waved off a timeout on the final possession: \"I told him, 'Go win the game.'\"\n— Jay King (@ByJayKing) January 14, 2017 Why do they call him the King in the Fourth?\nAfter his 20 pt outburst in the final frame last night, Isaiah Thomas leads the NBA with 334 Q4 pts.
