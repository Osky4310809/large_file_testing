Darrell Sapp/Post-Gazette An inmate walks through an outdoor area at SCI Pittsburgh. The state prison is slated to close later this year, the Wolf administration said today. By Karen Langley / Harrisburg Bureau \nHARRISBURG -- The Wolf administration has decided to close the Pittsburgh state prison by the end of the year to help balance the Pennsylvania budget, the Department of Corrections said in a statement Thursday. \nIt will be a second closing in little more than a dozen years for the 19th-century prison on the Ohio River, after the state emptied the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh of prisoners in 2005 but then reopened it in 2007 as the Pennsylvania inmate population continued to grow. \nThe administration said earlier this month that it planned to close two prisons, out of five possible sites. But it said today that the other four prisons would remain open. \nIt has said Pennsylvania could save $81 million annually from shuttering SCI Pittsburgh. Only one of the other four prisons on the chopping block -- SCI Waymart in Wayne County -- would have saved about that much, according to the Department of Corrections, while the other three -- in Schuylkill, Mercer and Luzerne counties -- would have saved considerably less. \nCorrections officials have described the plan to close prisons as an effort to help close a looming $1.7 billion projected shortfall in next year's Pennsylvania budget. They said they can safely close prisons because of newly available beds in a Cumberland County prison and because of a decline in the state's prison population, a reversal of a decades-long trend. \nThe administration's initial announcement of prison closings, three weeks ago, stated that SCI Pittsburgh would \"present significant challenges for closure.\" That statement pointed to the prison's role as a diagnostic and classification center for incoming inmates and its medical specialty services, including an oncology unit. \nThe news of the pending closings prompted pointed questions from legislators, particularly those whose districts contain or neighbor one of the five prisons on the initial list. During a Senate hearing Monday, corrections officials were pressed about the speed of their decision. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, and Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, asked Wolf in a letter to delay the decision. \nSCI Pittsburgh employs about 550 people, more than half of whom live in Allegheny County, according to the Department of Corrections. Gov. Tom Wolf has said that every affected worker will be offered a job elsewhere. \nAsked earlier this week on KDKA-AM what made SCI Pittsburgh vulnerable, Wolf noted the prison is an old one -- it opened in 1882 -- and that there are \"alternative economic development opportunities\" on the site. \nOf the five counties with prisons on the list for potential closure, Allegheny County was the only one with an unemployment rate below 5 percent as of November, according to a Department of Corrections facility analysis. \nSCI Pittsburgh is home to more than 1,800 prisoners, as of earlier this week. \nLong before the 2005 mothballing of the prison, it had been targeted for closure. A 1911 law observed that the Western Penitentiary, as the Pittsburgh prison was known, \"is greatly overcrowded as well as otherwise inadequate and so unsanitary that numerous cases of tuberculosis exist among the prisoners confined therein,\" according to the Department of Corrections. \nThe announcement drew criticism from the corrections officers union and the state senator whose district includes the prison. \nIn a statement, the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association president, Jason Bloom, said the decision had not been transparent. \n\"Communities were given only weeks to fight each other to stay open,\" he said. \nState Sen. Wayne Fontana, D-Brookline, said in a statement that he was disappointed both in the decision and the \"hasty and flawed process\" used to arrive at it. \n“In its rush to close SCI-Pittsburgh, the department largely ignored community input, the plight of local prison workers and the impact that this closing will have on our region’s economy,\" Fontana said. \nor 717-787-2141", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T17:55:42.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
