While it might look silly (to some) to take your Harry Potter book to bed each night and pray that Sirius Black doesn't die this time around, movies are the sane way of keeping that craziness alive. All you need to do is hit rewind and watch your favourite characters come to life, over and over again. Last year we had gems like The Girl On The Train and The Jungle Book that managed to stay true to essences of those tomes (and didn't have us jumping out of our seats screaming ‘that's not how it happened in the books' too many times). This year too we have some great adaptations to look forward to and we suggest putting them on the TBR (to be read) list right away so that you are better prepared to watch the film. 1. Fifty Shades: Darker by E. L. James \nThe first movie in the series, Fifty Shades of Grey , created quite a storm and the second movie promises to be as steamy as the sequel.
