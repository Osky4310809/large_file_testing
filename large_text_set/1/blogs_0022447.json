Races like Rugged Maniac, Spartan, and Tough Mudder not only crush your lungs, legs, arms, and core, but also test your coordination and mental strength. \nIndeed, these races will kick your butt—especially so if you approach them like most guys do: By thinking your regular old routine of either running or lifting is enough to get you over the finish line. Advertisement \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nThat’s just not so, says Alexander Nicholas, CPT, group fitness instructor and owner and founder of Epic Hybrid Training in New York City. The key to conquering these races is to combine the fitness disciplines, train at the manic pace you’ll face on race day, and mimic many of the awkward movements you’ll do in the course, he says. \n“In an obstacle race, you need to ‘start and stop’ different muscle groups when transitioning through different obstacles, which leaves your entire body fatigued,” says Nicholas. In a Rugged Maniac race, for example, you might run a half mile through mud and water, then pull yourself up a massive warped wall, then climb across a cargo net before sliding 60 feet into water. \nWith that in mind, Nicholas designed these two high-intensity interval workouts to help everyone from average guys to seasoned OCR pros excel at their next race. You’ll hammer your muscles and lungs, and build the strength and mobility you need for any obstacle. He suggests doing each of the workouts once a week along with your regular fitness routine. \nFair warning, says Nicholas. These workouts are intense. Do them 3 to 4 days apart so your body has enough time to recover. The upshot: You’ll blast a ton of fat in the process, and have a serious leg up on your competition. Photograph courtesy of Rugged Maniac Workout #1: The Ultimate Obstacle Course Race Circuit \nIn this intense workout, you’ll practice the most common OCR movements that tend to throw guys off their game on race day. It’ll help you pull ahead on race day, and will also fill a ton of gaps in your overall strength and fitness. \nDirections: Warm up by performing 5 reps of pushups, 5 reps of air squats, then 5 reps of situps. That’s 1 round. Do as many rounds as you can in 3 minutes. \nNow move onto the workout: Perform the exercises below in the order shown for 40 seconds each. Rest 20 seconds between each exercise. Once you’ve complete the last exercise, that’s 1 round. Do 6 total rounds. \n1. Jumping pullup \nStand in front of a pullup bar, ideally one that’s 12 to 18 inches above your hands when your arms are overhead. Jump vertically and grab the bar with an overhand grip. Pull yourself up until your chin is over the bar. Continue doing pullups for the remainder of your 40 seconds. \n2. Bear crawl drag \nGet on all fours—like you’re about to crawl—with a sandbag or 15 to 35 pound kettlebell on the floor between your knees. Reach between your legs and pull the weight across the floor up in front of you. Now, bear crawl forward until the weight is between your legs again. Repeat. \n3. Gorilla hang pullup \nStand underneath a pullup bar so you’re perpendicular to it. Grip the bar with one hand in front and the other right behind it, like you’re gripping the handle of a baseball bat. Now pull yourself up until your right shoulder touches the bar. Slowly lower yourself. Repeat, this time touching your left shoulder to the bar. Repeat back and forth for 40 seconds. \n4. Jumping lunge jack \nStand with your feet hip-width apart. Step backwards with your right leg so your right knee is just above the ground, your left knee forward and bent 90 degrees. Jump as high as you can as you switch legs mid-air and land so your left knee is just above the ground and your right knee is forward and bent 90 degrees. Now do two traditional jumping jacks. Repeat the pattern for time. \n5. Plank to elbow touch \nAssume a pushup position. Raise your left hand, bend your left arm, and slowly touch your left elbow to the floor. Reverse the movement, then repeat with your right arm. Continue the pattern for 40 seconds, occasionally adjusting the distance between your feet throughout. \n6. Lateral box skater \nStand with your right foot flat on a box or bench, your left foot on the ground. Jump laterally to the right so that your left foot is on the box and right foot is on the ground. Continue going back and forth for time. Workout #2: Obstacle Course Race Lung Tamer \n“The workout simulates the unforgiving pace and challenges found during an obstacle race,” says Nicholas. “It also helps you prepare mentally for the types of different cardio and muscle exertion experiences during the race.” \nDirections: After a warmup of your choice, hop on a treadmill and set it to a pace that’s equivalent to your fastest 1-mile pace. Run for 60 seconds. Rest 10 seconds, then perform the first strength exercise, Spiderman pushups, for 60 seconds. Rest 10 seconds. \nThat’s 1 round. Do 6 rounds, then rest 90 seconds. \nRepeat the pattern with each successive exercise. So, for example, next you would do 6 rounds of 60-second runs and kettlebell swings, then 6 rounds of 60-second runs and dumbbell thrusters. If this is too hard, you can cut your rounds in half, or cut the time of each exercise to 30 seconds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:40:03.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
