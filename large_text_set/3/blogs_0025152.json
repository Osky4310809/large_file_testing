What's not to love about a tube of golden, fried dough slathered in cinnamon and sugar, am I right? But it looks like these tasty pastries just got a colorful, Instagram-ready upgrade, thanks to one sweets shop in California. The Loop specializes in handcrafted churros, offering its one-of-a-kind treats either dipped (in sauces like dulce de leche and Nutella), glazed (with toppings like chocolate or matcha crunch), or chilled (in soft-serve ice cream with other tantalizing toppings mixed in). Are you drooling yet? \nIts latest crave-worthy creation is the Crystal Rainbow Churro Loop, a vibrant churro covered in rainbow sugar and served in vanilla soft serve with your choice of topping (like caramel popcorn, marshmallows, or Fruity Pebbles). Like, whoa . When The Loop started serving this delectable limited-edition goody, visitors couldn't help but share photos of their churros on social media because, well, just look at them!
