While these figures are fictional, many of their favorite haunts are real—and a creative typographic map, spotted by The Telegraph , lets readers follow in their footsteps. \nThe artwork was designed by Run For The Hills , a London-based creative studio run by Dex, an artist, and Anna Burles, an interior designer. It features characters from more than 250 books set in London; each one \"has been plotted in the corners of the city they most liked to roam or chose to call home (sometimes on Her Majesty’s Pleasure),” according to the website description. \nSome character names, like Oliver Twist and Dorian Gray, are instantly recognizable. Others, like Nicholas Forsyte and Stella Rodney , might require a little Googling. And even though England is known for its canonical 19th-century novels, the poster also lists figures from contemporary works, like the lovably clumsy Bridget Jones. \nThe Literary London map is available for purchase online. (It’s currently on sale for around $190.) Check out some photos below. \nAll photos courtesy of Run for the Hills.
