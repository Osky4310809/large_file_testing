However, there has never before been a medium for children to learn about guns – until NOW! In his new book, Safety On: An Introduction to the World of Firearms for Children , Yehuda Remer tackles just that. \nWhile your kids are being force-fed books about sex transitions and the re-writing of history from the likes of CNN, MSNBC, and all other media outlets, Mr. Remer has given parents the ability to bring gun safety into their own homes in an easy and readable manner. \nThis book is a must have for anyone who has kids. The clear and precise manner in which Mr. Remer goes through the basics of gun safety is what we need today. It is easily readable for parents as well as those who have kids that are just beginning to learn how to read. \nThe book is not merely an in-depth breakdown of gun safety, but allows for an opening where parents can introduce firearms to their children. \nRetired Lieutenant Colonel (National Rifle Association of America Board of Directors, Lifetime, and Endowment Member) Allen B. West gave the following endorsement of Safety On … \n“In today’s America there are many voices that garner a platform to speak up against our constitutional rights. Quite a few of those voices speak up against our second amendment right to keep and bear arms, and that right is to not be infringed. The opponents and detractors of our constituional second amendment right oft time seek to use fear mongering tactics with our children in order to advance their ideological agenda. That is why as a Dad, a career Army officer, and a Board Member of the National Rifle Association I applaud Yehuda Remer’s book, “Safety On”. Yehuda takes the approach of a responsible adult and legal gun owner to teach our children about firearm safety in a manner easily understood. His literary work does not attempt to implement any ideological agenda other than enabling an honest discussion in order to de-mystify law abiding gun ownership. It is vital that the future generations of Americans realize that our second amendment right safeguards our first amendment rights. This is a great book for Dads to share and read with their children, highly recommended.” \nHere are a few images from the book… \nIf you have a young child interested in firearms (or you want to teach your child firearm safety) this is the book for you. \nPick up a copy today for only $12 at this link .
