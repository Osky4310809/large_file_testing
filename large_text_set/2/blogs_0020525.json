The actress had appeared on the show along with her Rangoon co-star Saif Ali Khan . And while the show was really interesting, Karan and his whole team were in for a shock when Kangana declared, “In my biopic, if it is ever made, you (Karan) will play this stereotypical Bollywood biggie who is very snooty and completely intolerant to outsiders and the flag bearer of nepotism, the movie mafia. You will have a huge part to play in my biopic. I like the antagonist in you in my biopic.” \nWhile there have been various reports that Karan Johar was not happy with her comments, the film-maker has finally revealed what he really felt about Kangana’s statements. During a Twitter conversation with his followers, when KJo was asked if Kangana’s comments on nepotism were correct, the chat show host replied, “Not entirely! She made an impact with her sweeping statements! That was fun…for her! And the show.” When another person asked him if he was actually obsessed with star kids, Karan replied, “#askkangana.” ALSO READ – Koffee With Karan season 5: Kangana Ranaut puts Karan Johar in a tight spot while Saif Ali Khan looks on amused Not entirely!
