The 4x4 cars have already taken to public roads in test in Gothenburg, Sweden. \nSpeaking before a conference on insuring autonomous cars in London on Thursday, Anders Eugensson of Volvo told the Guardian: “They [the engineers] will not read the newspaper; they will sit there ready to grab the wheel. We need to work on it [the technology] more before we can hand the cars to the public.” \nVolvo is also using databases of car crashes going back decades to run a variety of simulations to make the cars safer. It will then start recruiting up to 100 commuters for the London trial to try out its semi-autonomous vehicles from the summer of 2018. \nEugensson said Volvo was looking for professionals of different age groups – people who regularly commute to or from west London via the M40, M4, M25 or A4. \n“We focus on people who are normally frustrated when they drive to work in the morning. We really want people who say: ‘I think it’s going to be useful for me to be able to use this time.’” \nThe cars will drive themselves on motorways and dual carriageways, giving commuters a chance to “take the laptop and prepare for your meeting that morning, read the newspaper or update your Facebook”, Eugensson added. However, drivers will take over as soon as they get into London, with the vehicle signalling well before that the driver needs to take control. \nThe carmaker does not anticipate that drivers will need additional training or driving tests.“Our aim is to make it almost like using your smartphone,” Eugensson said.

The Hain family are among those taking part in the Swedish trial. Eugensson said the carmaker would follow a similar approach in London. \nVolvo is yet to decide whether to use unmarked cars in London, possibly with special licence plates to alert police to their semi-autonomous status. In Gothenburg, the vehicles are marked with bold blue stripes and the Drive Me name. \n“We got a mixed reaction from other road users: some tried to damage the car and push it off the road,” Eugensson said. \nThe idea behind the trials, which are also planned for China and probably the US, is to find out how other road users react and whether motorists find self-driving cars safe and useful. A firewall will be installed between the vehicle’s different systems in an effort to ensure that steering, braking and acceleration cannot be hacked. The trial will examine how other road users react and whether drivers find self-drive safe and useful.

Eugensson reckons it will be 30-40 years until fully autonomous cars are in everyday use. \nThe Volvo cars use a combination of cameras, radar transmitters, sensors, laser scanners, 3D maps and GPS. A trifocal camera at the top of the windscreen spots pedestrians and other obstacles that appear suddenly. \nAside from safety, insurance is the other big challenge. Experts are predicting a shift from a fault-based, or tort liability, system – in which companies pay according to each party’s degree of fault – to a product liability system. Data recorders will help establish whether the vehicle technology or the driver is to blame in the event of an accident. Insurance premiums are expected to drop. \nEugensson said: “There needs to be a quick [claims] process for the customer ... If the car was clearly at fault, the insurance company can pay the customer and we speak to the insurance company” and cover the damage. \nJaguar Land Rover and Ford are also undertaking trials, but the Volvo pilot is the largest one on public roads. Self-driving pods and shuttles have been tested on pavements in Greenwich, Milton Keynes and Coventry. \nVolvo’s self-driving cars will come with a hefty price tag, Eugensson said, although it is set to drop once they become more common. Last year, its chief executive, Håkan Samuelsson, told the Guardian that Volvo hoped that one in four owners of premium cars would buy a self-driving vehicle .
