Or robbery, in all honesty. It could be a song about armed robbery. \nThe chorus goes, \nIf we go down, then we go down together.They’ll say you could do anything,they’ll say that I was clever.If we go down, then we go down together.We’ll get away with everything.Let’s show them we are better.Let’s show them we are better.Let’s show them we are better. \nThis is clearly just the life and times of Bonnie and Clyde, a couple the Chainsmokers are not the first to memorialize in their music. \nBeyoncé and Jay Z likened themselves to the criminal couple in “’03 Bonnie & Clyde,” and Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames climbed the charts in 1968 telling their story in “The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde.” Giphy \nAlso, there was that whole Broadway musical, for a minute. \nPoint is, bank robbery is a federal crime. Bonnie and Clyde committed a series of violent, federal crimes and were shot to death in their car wearing whatever shapeless wool scraps people wore during the Great Depression. \nEnjoy the Chainsmokers’ new single if you must, but remember that as moving as music is, it’s not an invitation to walk into a bank, hold everyone hostage and steal a bunch of cash that was never yours to begin with. \nDon’t be an asshole and ruin “Paris” for all of us. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
