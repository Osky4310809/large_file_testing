Youâ€™ll be able to do so very soon because the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has partnered with Mastercard to launch a trial of its account-based ticketing (ABT) system. The pilot launches on 20 March in Singapore, the first country in Asia to test the service, and will be available with Mastercard-issued contactless credit and debit cards. Just tap them on the reader when boarding the bus or train in place of regular stored-value EZ-Link cards. Fares will be billed each month along with other card purchases in the credit card statement, and you can also track your journey and fare history via a Web portal or mobile app. The service provides a convenient alternative to carrying around multiple cards for different purposes in your wallet, and is expected to attract at least 100,000 commuters. Want to give it a go? Register for the service here and add your contactless Mastercard to your account from 20 March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T10:22:44.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
