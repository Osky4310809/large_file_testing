The Department has no information that supports those tweets.”\n\nComey reiterated that any wiretapping of a U.S. citizen would require a “rigorous, rigorous process that involves all three branches of government” and has been in place since the 1970s. He said that “no president could” unilaterally order that kind of wiretapping.\nThere was only one issue on which Comey demurred. Asked about a tweet from Trump which claimed that Obama was “turned down” by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a request to do the surveillance, Comey said he could not comment “one way or another” on that subject, but said not to read too much into his non-response.\nIs it legal for a sitting President to be \"wire tapping\" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 \nAt the same hearing, National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers also shot down the White House’s repeat of a claim from a conservative pundit that Obama might have asked British intelligence to wiretap Trump.\n“That would be expressly agains the construct of the Five Eyes agreement that’s been in place for decades,” he said.\nThe British spy service GCHQ had previously rebuffed the claim , calling it “utterly ridiculous.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:33:25.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
