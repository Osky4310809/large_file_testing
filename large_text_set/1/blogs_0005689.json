We already knew he’d be teaming up with the Hulk in the upcoming ’80s sci-fi-inspired movie, but there’s now confirmation that they’ll be joined by another Marvel hero.\nIn a look forward for 2017’s big events from Disney’s D23 fan club , Doctor Strange’s appearance was confirmed: “If you need even more intergalactic, world-saving action, Thor: Ragnarok in November brings together Thor, the Hulk, and Doctor Strange to face off against intergalactic baddies both familiar and new.” Benedict Cumberbatch has certainly been busy, huh?\nThis connection has shown up before in a less obvious way , but the description certainly makes it sound like Strange will get more than just a cameo. The team also just makes sense, with Strange and Thor sharing the connection that they’re both a bit more otherworldly and mystical than the rest of Marvel’s existing on-screen heroes. Thor: Ragnarok will open in theaters on November 3, 2017.\n(via ComingSoon.net , image via Marvel Entertainment)\nWant more stories like this?
