An avowed White nationalist who famously declared “Hail Trump!” during a Trump victory rally and later called for a “peaceful ethnic cleansing” of the US, Spencer’s is a name no one would have ever heard of if it weren’t for our current POTUS’s rhetoric during the campaign. His has become a face that represents the alt-right’s most loathsome qualities — so perhaps it was no surprise when he got punched in the head during a live TV interview on inauguration day.\nNow, no one should be promoting violence , but it’s not hard to understand why this unknown assailant took at swing at this well-known racist. Which is exactly what Tim Heidecker sings about on his new song “Richard Spencer”. A warm and comforting piano ballad, the song finds Heidecker admitting that, “You can’t wish anyone dead/ Even if the baseball cap is red,” only to couch that statement with, “But if you see Richard Spencer/ Why don’t you punch him in the head.” After all, “ain’t no one gonna cry” if you give him “a big black eye.”\nTake a listen below.\n\nHeidecker previously got into the political comedy music ring with his track “Trump’s Pilot” , and he’s scheduled to contribute to the Our First 100 Days subscription compilation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:41:08.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
