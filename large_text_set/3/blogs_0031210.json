W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) March 28, 2017 Historians are going to survive extinction, eh. https://t.co/NhTKBEXnni \n— Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) March 28, 2017 \nIndeed, many others chimed in to ask, perhaps in earnest, just how exactly historians would be able to write about the extinction of humanity if they themselves were also extinct. Furthermore, who exactly would read their writings if they were somehow able to avoid the catastrophic extinction of humanity via Trump? \nMichael Moore has once again displayed one of the more telling failures of the progressive ideology: a fundamental lack of critical thinking skills or logic and reason. \nAlas, he and his ilk are unlikely to learn anything from this instance and will simply move on to the next breathless allegation of impending doom at the hands of the environment-hating, fascist, Hitler-esque, racist, sexist tyrannical Trump, or something like that. \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so everybody can see how Michael Moore came unglued at Trump’s latest executive order.
