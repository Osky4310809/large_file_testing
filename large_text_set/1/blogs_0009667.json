papers,” Guardiola said of Jesus on Friday. “When Palmeiras and the FA solve the problems he will be able to play.” \nThe FA banned third-party ownership at the start of the 2008-09 season following the controversy caused by Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano’s moves to West Ham. \nThe regulations mean all clubs under the FA’s jurisdiction must own 100% of their players’ rights. \nThe dispute between Caran and Palmeiras, which City are confident has no bearing on Jesus' registration, has been rumbling on for months. \nJesus was personally dragged into the row back in September when Caran, in response to Palmeiras' decision to go to court, provided Brazilian publication UOL with screenshots of Whatsapp conversations with his former client. \nThe messages showed Jesus criticising the Palmeiras board for their role in the disagreement, and that he wanted to pull the plug on his big move just so the Brazilian club would not receive any money. \n“Fabio, you know how the president [of Palmeiras] is,” Jesus said in the messages. “For me, Palmeiras should only take what they are entitled to. Seriously, honestly. \n“But unfortunately there are still egotistical people [involved]. I swear, I almost pulled out of the deal so Palmeiras didn’t get anything.” \nJesus was also said to have been in support of his former agent’s claim to a percentage of the deal: “Fabio, I already told the guys to pay what they had to,” he added. “I can't make them, I have not signed anything yet and until I sign we will try, but I can’t make the president do anything, and you know how he is.” \nPep unlikely to add to City squad in January \nBut Jesus then insisted he was disappointed that Caran had provided details of their private conversations, saying he felt \"tricked and manipulated by somebody I used to trust\", who had provided an \"incomplete and out-of-context\" section of their interactions. \nJesus will be fit to contribute when his registration as a City player is eventually accepted by the FA. \nThe forward was given December off after his exploits with Brazil and Palmeiras in 2016, but has been training with his team-mates since January 6 and is said to be progressing well.
