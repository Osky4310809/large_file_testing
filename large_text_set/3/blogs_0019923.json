And frankly, it’s not always possible for those with jam-packed schedules. But forgoing a healthy, muscle-fueling diet isn’t an option when you want to make gains. That’s why we love the idea of using leftovers to make protein-rich lunches for the week; it means there’s one less meal to stress about. \nIf you’re already cooking up basics like veggies, whole grains, and meat, the midday dishes you can create are truly endless—all it takes is a bit of imagination. From tacos to pizza, and everything in between, we’ve got the answers your lunchbox has been looking for. All of our ideas have about 25 to 30 grams of protein so you can stay on track with our beginner bodybuilder’s meal plan . And of course, feel free to add more veggies and protein to these dishes if you don’t think the portions will keep you satisfied ‘til your afternoon snack. Tacos Andrew Purcell \nLooking for a way make lunchtime more exciting? Have a deskside fiesta with a midday taco, suggests Sarah Koszyk, R.D.N., sports nutritionist and author of 365 Snacks for Every Day of the Year . “When making fish or other proteins, cook extra so you can use it the next day to make tacos. Add the meat to two soft corn tortilla and top with some salsa, avocado, beans, and lettuce. The meat and beans will provide about 36 grams of protein, and the avocados will provide satiating, healthy fats. It’s delicious and nutritious all in one meal.” To ensure you don’t wind up with a soggy lunch, combine the meat and beans in a container that you can reheat at work and pack up everything else separately. This way, when you assemble your taco, it tastes nice and fresh. 3 of 11 Mediterranean Mix Shutterstock \nHave a bunch of random things in your fridge? “Think outside the box and create a multiple course meal to meet your nutritional needs,” suggests Heather Mangieri, M.S., R.D.N . “For example, a small plate of six olives, 1-ounce of cheese, six whole grain crackers, and 1 cup of raw veggies provides a nice balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. To round out your meal, have a 5-ounce container of Greek yogurt with some fresh berries for dessert.” Not only does this meal have a wide array of nutrients, but it also serves up about 26 grams of protein. 4 of 11 Protein Quinoa Bowl Brian Klutch \nIf you follow a clean diet, you likely make giant batches of various veggies, proteins, and whole grains at the beginning of the week. While you may typically enjoy each dish side-by-side on your dinner plate, why not use them to create a something a bit different for your midday meal? To pull together a protein-packed quinoa bowl layer ¾ cup of quinoa or brown rice in a Tupperware container, along with ¾ cup of leafy greens, ½ cup of raw or roasted veggies, and ½ cup of chopped organic chicken, grass-fed steak, shrimp, ham, or beans. The resulting dish will have about 31 grams of protein and at least 6 grams of satiating fiber. 5 of 11 Green Meal Replacement Smoothie Shutterstock \n“If it’s ripe fruit that you need to use up, consider making a balanced smoothie,” suggests Mangieri. This is a great go-to lunch when you’re at home and too busy to whip together a meal. Blend 1 serving leftover fruit (1 cup or 1 piece) and a handful of greens, with 1½ cups milk, 3/4 scoop of unsweetened protein powder, and a drizzle of honey to create an on-the-go meal for hectic days. “This blend provides about 28 grams of protein and 30 to 40 grams of carbohydrates, making it a well-rounded meal,” Mangieri notes. 6 of 11 Leftover Soup Sam Kaplan \nTransform culinary odds and ends into a muscle-fueling meal with the help of chicken or veggie stock. Simply toss low-sodium stock into a storage container along with leftover chopped and cooked veggies, grains, beans, and meat, and zap it in the office break room when you’re ready to manga. “Half a cup of beans has about 8 grams of protein, 2.5-ounces of meat has about 18 grams of protein, and depending on the grain and veggie, you can get some extra protein source in the mix. With this meal, you’re guaranteed more than 26 grams of protein,” Koszyk says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:44:00.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
