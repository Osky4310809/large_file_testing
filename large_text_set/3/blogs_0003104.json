But 30 years after his death, it is thanks to federal funding that a long-planned project celebrating his legacy will be built.\nThe Department of Canadian Heritage announced Tuesday that it will give $750,000 to Espace René-Lévesque, “a heritage circuit commemorating the life of the former premier of Quebec” in the Gaspé town where he was raised, New Carlisle.\nHeritage Minister Mélanie Joly hailed Lévesque as “one of Quebec’s greatest political figures” and said the new circuit will “give visitors from across Canada the chance to learn more about this influential man.”\nThe site will feature a welcome pavilion and a series of outdoor stops marking different phases of Lévesque’s life, from his childhood to his time as premier when he led separatist forces in the unsuccessful 1980 referendum.\nJustin Tang/CP Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly “At all of these stops we will be able to meet Mr. Lévesque and see what he left as a political message,” explained Louis É. Bernard, president of the non-profit foundation that began pushing for the project in 2009.\n“We want to especially put the emphasis on Mr. Levesque’s great preoccupation for democracy, his respect for others, his defence of the rights of the little guy and his political integrity.”\nThe federal grant through the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund is the biggest single contribution, covering one-third of the roughly $2.2-million construction cost. The Quebec government has committed $400,000 and the provincial utility Hydro-Québec another $200,000. The balance comes from corporate and private donations.\nEven though Lévesque was a thorn in Ottawa’s side for much of his political career, Bernard said politics were not an issue in securing federal funding for what will be the first centre honouring Lévesque. He said Canadian Heritage did not seek control of the exhibit’s content, requiring only that a logo be posted marking the federal contribution.\nSince his death in 1987 at the age of 65, Lévesque has become a secular saint in Quebec, widely hailed for helping shape modern Quebec. As a Liberal minister under Jean Lesage in the 1960s, he led the drive to nationalize private utilities.\nRelated ‘I never wanted to unleash passions’: Montreal sparks outrage as Vimy Park renamed for Jacques Parizeau Move to rename Montreal’s Vimy Park after Jacques Parizeau called ‘an insult’ After splitting with the Liberals and founding the PQ, he brought in Bill 101 to protect the French language and introduced groundbreaking legislation to clean up political finances.\n“He started as a Canadian,” Bernard said. “He became a separatist to try to help the development of Quebec, not to diminish Canada.”\nA video produced by the foundation to attract donations offers an idea of the project’s lionizing tone. In it, Lévesque is described as “a national monument” and “an exceptional man, one who comes along once in a century.”\nPierre-Olivier Herbert, press secretary to Joly, said the grant reflects the government’s recognition of “the importance of cultural spaces in building vibrant communities.” He said the Lévesque project met “strict criteria” to be eligible for funding.\n• Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:27:23.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
