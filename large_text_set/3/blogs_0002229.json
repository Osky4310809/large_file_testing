Add Music \nSnaps are cool on their own, but they’re even better with music. \nYou need to have good timing for this to work - start by opening your favorite music app and finding the song you want to play. You then start recording your video on Snapchat. Make sure you push record during your favorite part of the song so that it will be included in your video. 4. Go Quiet with Your Videos \nWhat if you want a nice and quiet video? Background noise can turn a great video into a disaster, which you can eliminate with the tap of your finger. \nRecord your video and then click the microphone icon. This will remove the noise from your video. You're now ready to send your video out. 5. Add Your Own Captions and Drawings to “Discover” Content \nYou’re browsing through content from Snapchat’s Discover partners and you see something you want to share. Tap on it and then hold it down - Snapchat will open it up as a draft, and you can add your drawings or captions. Then, you can send it out to your friends. \nIt’s worth noting that you can’t share Snapchat Discover content to your Story, it’s only designed to be shared among friends. Because of this, adding captions and drawings to “Discover” Content likely won’t be a major part of your social media management efforts. 6. Get Colorful with Your Lettering \nAre you sick of words in the same boring colors? Mix it up by getting colorful with your lettering. \nYou can use a different color for every letter in a word - start by captioning your snap. You'll need to get the largest text size available, so click the “T” icon when you caption the snap. \nSelect a color from the color palette. Then, select a word in the caption and click Select. This highlights the word. Move the highlight so it's over a letter in the word. Then, change the color. Continue to do this until you have a multi-colored word. 7. Say More with Your Snaps \nGet wordy with your snaps by opening multiple lines of text. \nStart by opening Notes on your phone - hit Return once for each line that you want to create. For instance, if you want five lines of text, hit Return five times. \nCopy the empty lines and then move over to Snapchat. Create your Snap and click the “T” icon. Next, paste the lines that you copied, then select a line and start typing. In this fashion, you can easily fill your snap with text. 8. Play “Pin the Emoji” \nDo you remember playing pin the donkey when you were a child? Now it’s time to play pin the emoji. Only this time, you’re going to use a moving target. \nRecord a video that includes a moving object - finish filming and go to the preview screen. There, you'll see an emoji icon - click on it and choose your desired emoji. Resize it to the appropriate confiduration, then drag it over to the target in the video. Hold it there until Snapchat starts the video back up. Then, your emoji will play follow the leader with the moving target. 9. Open Your Color Palette \nIf you have an Android device, all your color options are readily available in the color palette. The same isn’t true for iOS device owners - you’ll need to do a little bit of work to open everything up. Once you do so, you can add the various colors and shades to your Snaps. \nIf you want to draw in black, open your color palette then drag your finger to the bottom and black will show up. \nIf you want to go with white, select the rainbow color palette then move your finger to the top-left hand portion of the screen. That will open up white. \nYou can open various shades of colors by choosing a color and moving your finger across the screen. 10. Make a Quick Switch from Selfie to Point-of-View \nSwitching between selfie and point-of-view mode might seem like a chore, but it’s a 'Snap' with Snapchat. Just double tap the screen to make the switch. 11. Create an Emoji Filter \nDo you have a favorite emoji? If so, turn it into a filter. \nStart by selecting an emoji, along with the color you want your filter. Next, place the emoji in the corner of the screen, and make the emoji bigger. As it gets bigger, it will want to come back to the middle of the screen, but continue to move it toward the corner. The edges of the screen will be semi-transparent and will act as the filter. 12. Get Engaged in a Fun and Easy Way \nIf you’re representing a brand, engagement is crucial to making sales. Fortunately, Snapchat makes this easy - ask people to send you a message, then send a pre-constructed message back with a coupon code or some other call-to-action to engage the user. \nTo do this, choose a username and swipe right on it - this will open up the Chat feature. \nThen, click on the image icon and select a photo. Personalize it and you’ll be good to go. 13. Get Creative with the Volume Buttons \nYour phone’s volume buttons aren’t just for volume control - you can also use them to record videos and take photos when using Snapchat. You can even use earbuds that include the volume control feature. 14. Save Your Data with Travel Mode \nIf you’re out and about while snapping, you can burn up some serious data - save it by enabling Travel Mode. In Travel Mode, your phone will only download Snaps when you click on them. \nThis is easy to do. Click on the ghost icon when you open Snapchat. There, you’ll see a gear icon - tap on it and go to 'Additional Services'. Select 'Manage' and click to enable Travel Mode. 15. Remove a Snap from Your Story \nYou have one bad snap in an otherwise great Story - it’s time to remove it. It doesn’t matter where the Snap appears, you can remove it easily with this process. \nGo to the default camera and swipe right - that'll take you to Stories view. Find your story and go to the Snap you want to delete. Swipe up on it and the trash can icon will appear. Tap on it and click 'Delete' 16. Find Out If You’re Being Followed \nYou can’t just look at your followers on Snapchat like you can on Twitter or Facebook, you have to go through a couple of steps to find out if someone is following you. \nFirst, you need to follow the person, then click on the person’s username and hold it down. Sometimes, a Snapchat score will appear. That means the person is following you. If you don't see a score, you aren’t being followed. 17. Make Zooming Easier \nYou don’t always have two free hands to zoom on Snapchat - if that’s the case, use this cool trick. \nStart by recording a video, then slide your finger up the screen if you want to zoom in. If you prefer to zoom out, slide it down the screen. 18. Access Old Community Geofilters \nDo you miss any of the old community Geofilters? Access them by editing a snap in Memories. \nJust press and hold the snap you want to edit - a pencil icon will appear. Tap on it and edit the snap. Swipe left to access the community Geofilters - in most cases, you can access the ones that were available when you uploaded the Snap. \nThen click 'Done' and swipe down - this'll take you back to Memories. 19. Broadcast Your Snapchat Profile \nYou want the whole world to know about your Snapchat profile. It’s easy to do - just memorize your sharable browser link and then share it. \nLinks are formatted the same way. Your link is: snapchat.com/add/YourUsername \nIf you know your username, you know your link. Get out there and spread the word. 20. Snapchat Trick - Get Crazy with Filters \nSnapchat has some cool filters, but you can get even more out of them by applying up to three filters per snap. This is a cool way to show off your Snapchat skills. \nStart by using the app to take a picture, then swipe left across the screen. This will let you choose a filter - put your thumb on the screen to secure the filter. Keep it on there while you use your other hand to swipe through additional filters. Choose it, and then take your thumb off the screen for a second. Then, tap your thumb and hold it in place once again. Now, you’re ready to choose your third filter. After you've selected all the desired filters, you're now ready to share your snap with the entire world. 21. Snapchat Trick - Easy Recording Trick \nIt’s hard to hold down the capture button and simultaneously keep your phone steady - especially when you’re moving between your front and rear cameras. This can make your Snapchat videos a wobbly mess. \nIf you have an IOS device, you can kiss the capture button goodbye, which enabled you to move between your front and rear cameras with ease. \nGo to your phone’s Settings and select General. Then: Click on Accessibility Turn on Assistive Touch in the Interaction section Select Create New Gesture Press your finger on the phone’s screen until the blue bar maxes out Click Stop", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:15:42.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
