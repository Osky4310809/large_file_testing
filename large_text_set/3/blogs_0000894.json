Brit Hume adds insult to injury about Dianne Feinstein’s Russia hypocrisy Posted at 10:31 am on March 3, 2017 by Doug P. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nSenator Dianne Feinstein and the Democrats have been sounding the alarm (lately) about Russia and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions’ meetings with the Russian ambassador last year. \nOne thing’s for sure, when it comes to meetings with the Russian ambassador, Feinstein isn’t really one to point fingers: On CNN, Sen. Dianne Feinstein describes meetings with Russian ambassador. 'I believe he's been in my office from time to time.' \n— Byron York (@ByronYork) March 2, 2017 \nBrit Hume describes how common it is by adding insult to injury, though Feinstein might not appreciate it: The last time I was in the Senate dining room, Feinstein was having lunch with the Russsian amb. I never gave it a second thought. https://t.co/azR0M5LrkK \n— Brit Hume (@brithume) March 2, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T18:42:14.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
