Djibril Cisse scored a crucial penalty in their shoot-out victory against Milan. \nThe game famously ended 3-3 after Liverpool managed to come from three goals down to take the game to extra-time. He scored their first goal of the campaign in a win over AS Monaco. \nA broken leg marred Cisse’s first season at Anfield but he still managed to five goals in all competitions. He followed that up with 19 the following season, including one in their FA Cup final win over West Ham.

Speaking about the end of his football career and the beginning of a new full-time venture, Cisse said: “I loved being a footballer, and so far the ball has been my life. I would have liked to continue playing but I must admit today that football is over. \n“With the same passion, I will devote myself wholeheartedly to my career as DJ, producer and consultant, as well as developing my clothes brand. Thanks to all of you for your support. \n“The adventure continues, another life begins. A lion never dies.” Loading tags...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:37:33.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
