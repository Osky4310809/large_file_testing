The debacle made for an embarrassing start for Republicans as they kicked off the 115th Congress. “House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called an emergency House GOP conference Tuesday around noon to scrap a proposed House rule that would have effectively declawed the Office of Congressional Ethics. The proposal, which House Republicans approved behind closed doors Monday night, would have defied Trump’s ‘drain the swamp’ mantra aimed at making Washington more transparent and less cozy,” reports POLITICO’s Rachael Bade .\nThe move came after public outcry and Trump’s tweeted opposition — not to the actual move, per se, but to the timing.\n“It’s a question of priorities,” transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday morning.\nAnd House Republicans weren’t Trump's only Twitter targets Tuesday.\nTRUMP TWEETS, GM RESPONDS : Trump blasted General Motors on Twitter Tuesday for, he said, “sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.” He added: “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!”\nGM responded with a statement, noting that they manufacture the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio, and that while it makes some of the hatchback models in Mexico, only a “small number” are sold in the U.S. More from POLITICO’s Louis Nelson .\nFORD, TARGET OF TRUMP’S IRE, CANCELS MEXICO PLANT : “Ford Motor said on Tuesday that it was canceling plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and would instead invest $700 million to increase production in Michigan. Ford had come under heavy criticism from Donald J. Trump during the election campaign for plans to expand production in Mexico,” reports Neal E. Boudette for the New York Times .\nTRUMP CALLS FOR END OF GITMO TRANSFERS : “There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, referring to the American prison at Guantanamo Bay, which President Barack Obama unsuccessfully sought to close.\nINAUGURATION RSVPS : Bill and Hillary Clinton will attend Trump’s inauguration, aides said Tuesday . The news came shortly after George W. Bush announced he and Laura would attend the ceremony . Dick Cheney, Bush’s VP, also said he will attend.\nTRUMP BOLSTERS WHITE HOUSE STAFF : “Donald Trump has tapped Katie Walsh to serve as deputy White House chief of staff and Joe Hagin to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations and Rick Dearborn as deputy chief of staff for policy, a transition official confirmed to POLITICO,” report POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt and Matthew Nussbaum .", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/business/ford-general-motors-trump.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news"], "published": "2017-01-03T13:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:47:49.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
