(PTI Photo) \nIn a comment that would further enrage the opposition leaders, who have been accusing the BJP of communalizing the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017, the saffron party’s president today coined a new acronym for his prime opponents Congress , Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. \nAddressing an election rally in Chauri Chaura, the BJP President said, “People of Uttar Pradesh get rid of ‘Kasab’ in this year’s election. I say this again, People of Uttar Pradesh get rid of ‘Kasab’ in this year’s election. Don’t take any other meaning of ‘Kasab’. By Kasab I mean, K for Congress party, S for Samajwadi Party and B for Bahujan Samaj Party. Unless you end Kasab, Uttar Pradesh will not develop.” \nShah also took a dig at UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav ’s free laptop scheme for the youth in the state, saying, “They will ask your religion and caste first, if that doesn’t seem favourable to them, they won’t give you laptop.” #WATCH : BJP President Amit Shah in Chauri Chaura asks people of Uttar Pradesh to get rid of ‘KASAB’ and what he means by it. pic.twitter.com/BZz3tYFGp5 \n— ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) February 22, 2017 \nEarlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had coined an acronym ‘SCAM’ for the three parties. Modi had explained the acronym as S is Samajwadi Party, C is Congress, A is Akhilesh Yadav and M is Mayawati. He had appealed voters not to waste their votes on the ‘Scam’. Two days ago while addressing a rally at Orai in Bundelkhand region, PM Modi had explained BSP as ‘Behenji Sampatti Party’. \nFor the record, Kasab was the only terrorist captured alive during 26/11 attacks in Mumbai in 2008. He was later hanged to death. \nShah’s comment comes days after PM Modi had accused the SP government in Uttar Pradesh of distributing power on religious basis. However, the opposition had hit back at the PM for polarising voters on communal lines. Akhilesh Yadav even indirectly likened Amit Shah and Modi to the “donkeys” of Gujarat. \nThe fourth phase of the seven-phase Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections will take place on Thursday. The results will be announced on March 11.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:51:11.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
