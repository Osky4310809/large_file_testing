When you are selecting a ringtone from the sound settings menu, an “Add Ringtone” option will appear at the bottom of the list of stock sounds. Tapping this will allow you to locate an audio file from your phone and, once you have, this will become available in the menu alongside the default sounds.\nSee also: You can thank Sony for some of the wireless audio improvements in Android O 1 day ago It’s not the biggest addition to Android O that we’ve seen so far, but it’s a clear improvement over the needlessly clumsy previous method.\nFor everything else you need to know about Android O , hit the link.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T14:00:44.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
