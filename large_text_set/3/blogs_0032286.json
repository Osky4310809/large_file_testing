During one section of the interview, Koppel interviewed Hannity at Fox News’ studios, and things got feisty between the two popular news hosts. \nKoppel leveled a charge against opinion news shows like the one Hannity hosts in prime time, to which Hannity responded, “We have to give some credit to the American people that they’re somewhat intelligent and that they know the difference between an opinion show and a news show,” Hannity said. “You’re cynical.” \n“I am cynical,” said Koppel. \n“Do you think we’re bad for America? You think I’m bad for America?” \n“Yeah.” \n“In the long haul I think you and all these opinion shows—” \n“That’s sad, Ted. That’s sad.” \n“No, you know why? Because you’re very good at what you do, and because you have attracted a significantly more influential—” \n“You are selling the American people short.” \n“No, let me finish the sentence before you do that.” \n“I’m listening. With all due respect. Take the floor.” \n“You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than facts.” \nHannity would later write on Twitter that CBS News edited out many of the examples Hannity gave to Koppel showing why he believes “journalism is dead” and that “liberalism has failed.” \n“Fake ‘edited’ news,” Hannity wrote about the clip that aired. “I gave a [sic] example after example of why I say ‘journalism is dead’. I also gave many examples of how liberalism has failed.” Fake “edited” news. I gave a example after example of why I say “journalism is dead”. I also gave many examples of how liberalism has failed https://t.co/prynzE2yLQ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 26, 2017 \nHannity also called on CBS News to release the entire interview, which he says lasted 45 minutes, so people can see the truth. \n“‘Fake Edited News’ @CBSNews release the Unedited [sic] 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room,” wrote Hannity. “I dare you!” “Fake Edited News” @CBSNews release the Unedited 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room. I dare you! https://t.co/prynzE2yLQ \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 26, 2017 \nHannity claims he repeatedly asked Koppel during the interview to keep important statements Hannity made throughout the interview in the final cut, statements Hannity says did not appear in the version CBS aired. \n“Funny behind the scenes After I answered the first question, Ted said ‘none of that will air’. So I kept saying ‘Ted u need to keep this in,’” Hannity wrote. Funny behind the scenes After I answered the first question, Ted said “none of that will air”. So I kept saying “Ted u need to keep this in” https://t.co/137pQ8GfLC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:05:01.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
