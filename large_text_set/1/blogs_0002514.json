The game in question wasn’t announced, but many speculated that it could be the upcoming Mass Effect Andromeda . Unfortunately, it appears that the fourth installment of Bioware’s popular space opera will not be landing on the Switch after all.\nSpeaking with Stevivor , producer Mike Gamble said that that there are no plans to release Mass Effect Andromeda on Nintendo’s handheld/console hybrid system.\n“Yeah, not right now, no,” said Gamble. “We’re not planning on it. If the Switch launches and everyone’s just yammering for Mass Effect , who knows. We never want to close doors like that.”\nMass Effect 3 was one of the bigger third party games to come out for the Wii U, so it is somewhat surprising that its direct sequel will not be headed to the Switch. However, a Switch port hasn’t been completely ruled out if there is demand for it. If the Switch is a big seller, it is easy to see EA and Bioware changing their stance on bringing Mass Effect Andromeda to Nintendo’s system.\nIn the same interview with Stevivor, Gamble said that more information about the game would be revealed later this month or February. Specifically, Bioware will speak about how the game will be enhanced for the PlayStation 4 Pro. Gamble also revealed that Mass Effect Andromeda will receive enhancements on Microsoft’s Project Scorpio, though he didn’t say when any news on that front would be announced.\nAs for the Switch, expect Nintendo to hold a Switch-specific Nintendo Direct on January 12 where the company will (hopefully) tell us more about the system’s specs, its capabilities, and of course, what games folks can expect to play when the device has released this March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:54:45.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
