For the women who deserve a place in our textbooks. For the women whose voices should echo. This piece — just one in a series — is for them. \nIn The Book of Salt , writer Monique Truong weaves the narrative of a gay Vietnamese chef who works for Gertrude Stein and her partner Alice B. Toklas. In the novel, protagonist Binh contemplates: “I am forced to admit that I am, to them, nothing but a series of destinations with no meaningful expanses in between.”\nTruong’s poignant exploration of self-identity and colonialism (in addition to sexuality) of those considered “the other” serves as a fitting introduction to a piece that intersects our fellow Asian and Pacific Islander sisters of color with the rose-colored imperialism presented in our history books: mostly western, mostly male. To diversify these narratives — and to celebrate the remarkable individuals once considered merely the oriental “other” — here are some of the Asian and Pacific Islander women we should have learned about in history class. Whether complex or flawed or saint-like, these are just a few of the women worth examining.\n1. Yuri Kochiyama #internationalwomensday#womenshistorymonth #yurikochiyama https://t.co/DzcltBWdNA pic.twitter.com/LvArQpyDLB \n— Densho (@DenshoProject) March 8, 2017 Kochiyama was a civil rights activist who fought for the anti-war movement, black power, and atonement for Japanese internment. She spent two years in an internment camp during WWII following her father’s death, who had been jailed after the Pearl Harbor attack under suspicions of being a national security threat. Her experiences and admiration for Malcolm X (whom she cradled in her arms after his assassination) catapulted her efforts into activism.\nKochiyama was also highly controversial due to her comments about Osama bin Laden, in which she revered him for his anti-U.S. government sentiments. Her friendship with prisoners, in which she coined “political prisoners” — referencing perhaps ideals of institutionalized incarceration implemented by the U.S. — was also controversial.\n2. Queen Liliuokalani Queen Liliuokalani last sovereign of the Kamehameha dynasty,which had ruled a unified Hawaiian kingdom since 1810. https://t.co/NtmATRyolH pic.twitter.com/kqz22OuCw3 \n— ELIZABETH LILLY (@chixtumanitue) March 6, 2017 Adding historical context to the phrase “Yas Kween,” Queen Liliuokalani was the first female monarch of Hawaii and last sovereign of the Kamehameha dynasty (which ruled Hawaii since 1810) after its U.S. annex in 1898. She temporarily gave up her throne to the U.S. — with the hope that it would eventually be restored — and to prevent violent backlash against the Hawaiian people. But independence was never regained. Along with this, Liliuokalani also endured house arrest for a year following accusations of counter-revolt.\nIn addition to her role as kween, Liliuokalani was a celebrated musician and composer. Her most prominent piece is titled “Aloha Oe,” which has been covered by the likes of Johnny Cash and serves as a staple of the island.\n3. Sarojini Naidu Sarojini Naidu #WomenHistoryMonth #patishere #untitledunmastered pic.twitter.com/YFYVeR8D3v \n— untitled unmastered. (@patishere3) March 15, 2017 A child prodigy and poet, Naidu was the first female president of the India National Congress AND first female governor of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Nicknamed the “Nightingale of India” due to her music and poetry, Naidu started college at the age of 12 and graduated by age 19. She then married her college bae — engaging in an inter-caste marriage when it was considered a crime at the time.\nNaidu also played a notable role in the Indian Independence Movement, which sought to separate India from British rule. She lectured on issues surrounding emancipation, female empowerment, and social welfare.\n4. Grace Lee Boggs Today we recognize Grace Lee Boggs for her efforts on empowering women, youth, & people of color #WomensHistoryMonth pic.twitter.com/mQltd7FOpr \n— Joint Center (@JointCenter) March 17, 2017 It was Boggs who wrote:\n“Women’s leadership in the public sphere didn’t come from the White House or from CEOs. It came only after millions of women came together in small consciousness-raising groups to share stories of our ‘second sex’ lives.” Considered the eldest human rights activist of our time, Boggs was a philosopher who fought for women’s rights, environmental justice, black power (alongside Angela Davis and Malcolm X), and labor rights. Married to African-American activist James Boggs, she wrote a series of books and was involved in many community efforts — efforts that ranged from advocating against poor living conditions in Chicago to creating charter schools and youth programs in Detroit.\n5. Corazon Aquino Our #WomensHistoryMonth woman of the day: Corazon Aquino. She was the first female president of the Philippines and the first in Asia. pic.twitter.com/a7cgEF4aLc \n— Womxn Magazine (@womxnmag) March 6, 2017 Having served as the first female president of the Philippines, Aquino’s leadership stemmed from opposition to then-dictator Ferdinand Marcos. She was married to Benigno Aquino Jr., a politician whose heavy opposition to Marcos resulted in imprisonment and exile to the US. Aquino Jr. was later assassinated upon returning to the Philippines in 1983, which spring-boarded Corazon’s fight against Marcos.\nWhile her presidency was tumultuous (she endured seven coup attempts and her economic policies were inept for a country plagued with poverty), she was responsible for restoring democracy in the Philippines after years of authoritarian rule. And for a “ housewife ” who came into a role that she didn’t really want, that’s pretty damn impressive.\n6. Anna May Wong We celebrate #AnnaMayWong , who used her international fame to fight for better roles for Asian actors in cinema. #InternationalWomensDay pic.twitter.com/erZyXEEDsE \n— Gemr Antique (@GemrAntique) March 8, 2017 Considered the first Chinese-American film star, Wong gained international recognition through dozens of movies in Hollywood and Europe. Her first role was in silent film The Toll of the Sea in the 1920s at the age of 17. She was considered a trailblazer in her own right — taking on typecast roles of the “exotic oriental” during a time of gleaming racism in Hollywood, when it was commonplace for white actors to don yellow face and squinted eyes for Asian roles.\nDespite possessing a magnitude of talent, being wildly articulate, and working alongside big names, she still fell victim to the perils of working in a white-washed industry — the most notable instance being her exclusion from the film The Good Earth , a drama about Chinese farmers. The leads were instead portrayed by actors of German and American descent. Inspired.\n\n7. Trung sisters The Trung Sisters, who led a rebellion (on elephants!) against the Chinese invasion of Vietnam. \nTheir story: https://t.co/cJF4yM5yAp pic.twitter.com/7z82dMMjLS \n— Mackenzi Lee (@themackenzilee) January 20, 2017 The Trung sisters, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi, were freedom fighters who led a rebellion against the Chinese Han-dynasty with a group consisting mostly of women fighters in 40 A.D. , briefly establishing a sovereign state. While their autonomy from the Chinese government was brief, with Trung Trac governing the people, think of these heroines as the Vietnamese Katniss and Primrose Everdeen, minus the love triangle and artificial arena narrative.\nPopular myth states that they drowned themselves after defeat to maintain honor, while others ascertain that they floated into the clouds. It’s an oddly poetic theory.\n8. Aung San Suu Kyi March is #WomensHistoryMonth - learn more about Aung San Suu Kyi: https://t.co/eLDkt2fs1E pic.twitter.com/BYCAntATtf \n— HEAL and the Nest (@HEALNest) March 17, 2017 Winner of a Nobel Peace Prize and recipient of a Congressional Gold Medal, Suu Kyi is a politician and writer whose activism started with peaceful movements for democracy. Throughout the course of her life, she has woven in and out of house arrest by the hands of the autocratic government for openly opposing dictator U Ne Win. The government promised her freedom if she left the country, but she refused to leave during the political turmoil.\nWhen she’d eventually try her hands at politics, she’d run into petty roadblocks implemented by the government to prevent victory. However, with help from the National League for Democracy, she secured a successful election. She currently serves as state counsellor of Myanmar, but it hasn’t been without controversy: She has been criticized for turning a blind eye on human rights of the Muslim Rohingya minority.\n9. Maya Lin How Maya Lin's brilliant Memorial design overcame early opponents https://t.co/SQcmx8yTff #WomensHistoryMonth pic.twitter.com/qh9kDeuWUq \n— Vietnam Vet Memorial (@VVMF) March 16, 2017 Lin is a designer and architect who, at the age of 21, designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. NBD. Entering a competition that consisted of more than 1,400 entries — and receiving a pesky B for it in her class at Yale — she won the design contest despite not being a trained architect. Her design received much controversy at the time, however, as congressmen blasted it as a “political statement of shame and dishonor” .\nLin also designed the Civil Rights Memorial in Alabama and Museum of Chinese in America in New York. Adding to her numerous accolades, Lin received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama in 2016.\n10. Phoolan Devi Phoolan Devi was the Indian 'bandit queen'. She opposed the caste system & was a symbol for the oppressed. pic.twitter.com/M1aSdQLDCl \n— Talal (@PharaohTalal) March 8, 2017 Devi’s story bears remarkable similarities to a blockbuster film: Nicknamed “Bandit Queen,” she took up a life of burglary and ultimately became a gang leader after enduring sexual abuse from a young age. She was married off at the age of 11 to an abusive husband, whom she managed to escape. The story told is that she and her gang returned to the village where she was gang raped as a teen, and when two of her rapists refused to let her know where the others were, she shot and killed everyone.\nAfter surrendering to the government, facing imprisonment, and eventually being freed from charges, she went on to serve as member of Parliament. She was shot in 2001 by masked assailants no doubt threatened by her level of badass.\n11. Junko Tabei @SAPIndia #SuperAwesomeWomen #womensday \nA10. Junko Tabei, a Japanese Mountaineer was the first woman to reach the summit of Mt. EVEREST.\n❤❤ pic.twitter.com/RA3L7uce1v \n— Nikunj Bajoria (@nikunjbajoria) March 8, 2017 A mountaineer, Tabei was the first woman to reach the top of Mount Everest in 1975 and, subsequently, was the first woman to climb the Seven Summits (the highest peaks of the seven continents!) in 1992. In a field inhabited mostly by men, this was (and remains) a remarkable moment for women during a time of being told that they should be “ raising children instead .” Boy, bye!\nTabei’s husband parented their young daughter during her excursion, which gained traction after she graduated college with a degree in English literature and formed an all-women climbing club. In addition to mountaineering, Tabei has written books, taken on environmental initiatives for sustainable climbing, and resided over preservation organizations.\nWhether through roles as activists, political queens, or artists, one fact is certain: These women were all capable of scaling the highest of mountains — some, literally.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:18:54.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
