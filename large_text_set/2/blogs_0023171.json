People with gum disease called periodontitis had significantly higher blood sugar levels than those without the condition, new research in BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care found. In fact, 18 percent of people with severe periodontitis were found to have undiagnosed diabetes. \nProtect Your Lungs The secret to healthy lungs might be found in red wine. Researchers from the Saban Research Institute of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles found that a compound in red wine called resveratrol may help slow age-related changes in lung function . The experiment, which involved inhaled resveratrol treatments, was done in mice, so human trials are necessary. \nRead the Labels For Edibles Marijuana edibles are legal in states like Washington and Colorado, but their labels may need a revamp. A study by RTI International discovered that lots of people aren’t reading the labels on marijuana edibles —and if they are, the information is hard to decipher. That’s because there’s often too much info on the labels, no indication that the product contains pot, and unclear directions for consumption, they say . Changes are needed, the researchers say, to make sure people know what they’re eating so they can take them safely. \nPower Out the E-Cigs There’s a lot of controversy out there about the health effects of e-cigarettes, and now a new study adds another problem to the mix. Researchers discovered that mice exposed to nicotine from vaping experienced worse outcomes and damage from strokes , possibly due to an increase in blood clotting, according to a preliminary study presented at the American Heart Association’s International Stroke Conference. That suggests vaping isn’t safer than traditional cigarettes from a brain health perspective—and may even pose a similar, if not higher, risk for more severe strokes, the researchers say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:31:49.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
