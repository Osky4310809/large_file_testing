UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 7 hours ago 5 \nTonight (February 3) in Copenhagen, Metallica was forced to end their show early due to frontman James Hetfield's undisclosed illness. \nJames addressed the crowd during the show, at one point asking whether it's OK to end the gig. \n\"It's not fair to you guys, man,\" he told the audience. \"You paid a lot of good money to come and see your favorite band, and we don't sound good. I'm gonna leave it up to you, man. Would you rather hear us sound better another time? I wanna stop. What do you say?\" \nIn the end, the gang played 16 tunes in total and reportedly dropped out \"Halo on Fire\" and \"Sad But True\" due to Hetfield's inability to continue. \nThe band is yet to release an official announcement regarding the whole situation. You can watch footage from the show below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:29:53.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
