Ingraham said on Fox News tonight that when “Ryan and company wanted to cut and run” in the last few weeks of the campaign, many of these Freedom Caucus members stood by him. \nAnd so, she argued, it’s “really really unhelpful to Donald Trump’s ultimate agenda to slam the very people who are going to be propping up his border wall, all the things he wants to do on immigration, on trade––I don’t know where he thinks he’s gonna get his friends on those issues, unless he completely flips to become more of a Democrat.” \nHowever, she did add that the health care failure is certainly not all on Trump. Ryan, Ingraham said, “should know his caucus better” and should have better prepared Trump for what he was going to face on this. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:50:01.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
