What about the engine? Will the next 911 be mid-engine or no? But Porsche told an outlet “maybe” or “we’ll consider it” last month and they took it as the supreme gospel truth? Let’s face it, everybody, Porsche is the world’s biggest troll.\nAdvertisement \n\nPorsche’s latest bit of trolling? Some rumblings about the 911 maybe going mid-engine, as Porsche Head of GT Cars Andreas Preuninger told Autocar : \n\nThere is nothing coming soon, but in the mid-term don’t rule [a mid-engined 911] out. I think that adding some excitement to the car in this way wouldn’t be bad.\nDo note: “nothing coming soon.” Part of me wonders if this was in response to a leading question that wasn’t printed Autocar’s article, but who wouldn’t say no to looking into a mid-engine 911? It’s neat, it’s what they race—why not? \n\nAdvertisement \n\nPorsche Vice President of Motorsport Frank-Steffen Walliser also confirmed to Autocar that there had been a high level of customer interest in a mid-engine 911. This I can believe: Porsche customers always dream of owning a barely road-legal version of the brand’s flagship GT race car. Walliser also noted that Porsche has a history of responding to customer demand, as they did in adding a manual transmission back to the 2018 911 GT3. \n\nBut let’s be honest: these statements sound like a more polished version of “Yeah, sure, that sounds cool,” not unlike Dodge’s “ I’d love to ”-style responses they give every time they’re asked if they’re ever returning to NASCAR. That being said, this attitude from Porsche is a complete 180 from Walliser’s statement just four months ago that “no production car with this layout is planned.”\n\nInside the back window of the new 911 RSR race car .

As Autocar notes, Porsche’s GT cars are always homologated as two-seaters, which is why cars like the 911 GT3 RS have a carpeted “parcel shelf” instead of human butt space behind the front seats. They’ve figured out the packaging on how make a mid-ship 911 RSR happen, and they’ve already raced it .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T15:41:11.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
