Rafa redeems himself after getting it wrong Rafael Benitez looks on (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nRafa Benitez made a surprising selection as he opted to go with no recognised strikers at the Amex. \nWith main frontman Dwight Gayle out injured, the Spaniard opted to leave Ayoze Perez, Daryl Murphy and Aleksandar Mitrovic on the bench. \nYoan Gouffran was tasked with leading the line and worked tirelessly but he's better suited to a deeper role. \nThe visitors dominated the ball throughout the first-half but the absence of an out-and-out striker was clear. \nIt was no surprise the game changed when Benitez threw on Murphy and Perez. 2. Madley's big call Brighton & Hove Albion's Glenn Murray scores (Photo: PA) \nBobby Madley made the headlines before this one, given his apparent allegiance to Huddersfield - who are vying with these two for promotion. \nHe will have been hoping for a quiet night but made a big call early on. \nThe referee awarded the hosts a penalty after Ciaran Clark hauled Glenn Murray to the deck. \nReplays showed it was six of one and half a dozen of the other - but defenders have been warned against shirt pulling in the box. \nMurray dusted himself down to score from the spot, leaving Benitez furious. 3. Lady luck smiles on Toon Newcastle United's Jonjo Shelvey (Photo: Getty) \nNewcastle won't have been happy about the opener - but luck was certainly on their side as they drew level. \nAfter a couple of fluffed shots, the ball ricocheted off Mo Diame and looped into the net. \nThe Senegalese midfielder had done next to nothing before that but it was a massive moment for the visitors. \nAs flukey as it was important, mind. 4. SAS make Seagulls tick Dale Stephens in action (Photo: The Chronicle) \nNeither are the most dynamic of midfielders but Steve Sidwell and Dale Stephens are vital to this Brighton side. \nThey win the ball, keep it simple and allow the flair players in front of them to do their thing. \nAt 34, Sidwell is the veteran of the partnership but he still has plenty to offer.

Promotion on the cards for both Rafael Benitez and Chris Hughton (Photo: PA) \nIt was no surprise to see the top two in the division play out a cracker. \nThese two have been up there all season and despite tonight's result, both should go up this season. \nThis was the first of three huge away games for Benitez's men with Huddersfield and Reading to come in the next week. \nThe Magpies picked up a vital win here and will go into those games full of confidence. \nBeat both though and automatic promotion will be within their grasp. poll loading Will Brighton and Newcastle BOTH get promoted? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:16:07.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
