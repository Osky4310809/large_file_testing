She got a new hair do while she was there (Photo: danniellawestbrook/Instagram) \nWhen asked if she'd ever think about returning to the show, Danniella told The Sun Online : \"Always, love EastEnders. The last time I went back fans [wanted me back] because [Sam’s] a superbitch and there’s good tension between her and Sharon and all that stuff. \n\"And now because you haven’t got the Pauline, Peggy and Pat types older characters and it needs Sam, Sharon and Roxy but they just won’t do it. \n\"They just will not do it. They have said I’m sacked, I’m this and that, they seem to use me for PR and not for the work.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T01:44:09.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
