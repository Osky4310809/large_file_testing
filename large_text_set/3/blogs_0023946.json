Planes in Virgin America’s fleets will start being repainted next year and by 2019, the Virgin America brand will be fully retired. \n“We spent the last 10 months conducting extensive research and listening carefully to what fliers on the West Coast want most,” Alaska Airlines vice president of marketing Sangita Woerner said in a statement.   \n“While the Virgin America name is beloved to many, we concluded that to be successful on the West Coast we had to do so under one name – for consistency and efficiency, and to allow us to continue to deliver low fares,” she said. \nRichard Branson, who founded Virgin America, voiced sadness at the decision. \n“ Many tears are shed today…over Alaska Airlines’ decision to buy and now retire Virgin America,” he wrote on his blog. “It has a very different business model and sadly, it could not find a way to maintain its own brand and that of Virgin America.”   \nBranson offered hope that the airline’s spirit would outlive its name. It is a sad (& some would say baffling) day. @VirginAmerica was the ride & love of a lifetime, but @Virgin flies on https://t.co/cgRnzQPIOa pic.twitter.com/8Q0nPsrvkc \n— Richard Branson (@richardbranson) March 23, 2017 \n“George Harrison once said, ‘All Things Must Pass.’ This was the ride and love of a lifetime. I feel very lucky to have been on it with all of you. I’m told some people at Virgin America are calling today ‘the day the music died’. It is a sad (and some would say baffling) day. But I’d like to assure them that the music never dies,” he added. \nThe news prompted a severe reaction on Twitter.
