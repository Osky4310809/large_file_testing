He said, I have a ‘complaint’ against the people of Aligarh and added, ‘Will you mind if I express this complaint?” He proceeded to ask the gathering the same question a number of times. The response from the gathered public was immediate – it roared its approval in an ear-splitting ‘No’ each and every time. PM said, “I hope the public does not mind, but In the last election I came to this venue for another rally and the maidaan was not even half-filled. Yet today here I am back again and what I see is astounding. As far as eye can see, there is a sea of people.” He said, “Wherever I look, I see the ‘kesariya’ (saffron flag) being waved. I can see that this time there is a storm of support coming for us in the Uttar Pradesh elections.” \nPM said, “I can read into this that there is overwhelming support for the BJP .
