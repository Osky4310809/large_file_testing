She's always straddled the line between good and evil, for the entire life of the character across nearly eight decades. But that's a lot for a young actor to take on - and a challenge from which Gotham star Camren Bicondova doesn't back down. Now in the middle of her third season with Selina - as a teenager and future Catwoman, though she's not quite there yet, Bicondova has had to deal with serious morality issues as the character just struggles to survive. \n\"Survival will alwyas be her goal. That's what kept her alive when her mom left her,\" Bicondova told Comicbook.com. So while she's worried about the issues with her mother Maria, and her relationship with Bruce that she's \"feeling weird about\" thanks to some big revelations in tonight's episode, survival is still priority number one. NEXT: Gotham: Camren Bicondova Teases More Catwoman Costuming for Selina After Winter Hiatus \nAs for how she'll be leaning after tonight and next week's events, as the show enters a winter hiatus returning at the end of April, well, Bicondova thinks it's much more complicated than simple Good vs. Evil. \n“I think she’ll be leaning more towards the ‘evil.’ Everybody says that Catwoman is an anti-hero, and the definition of an anti-hero is a hero that does bad things to do good; really that’s just a normal human being!\" she teased. \"So for me, I don’t see her as a hero or a villain either way. I see her as a human being who has to do things to stay alive. She’s a teenager in the anarchy of Gotham! So I think to give you an answer that you want, she’s leaning more toward the evil side, but to answer my way, she’s just going with the flow.\" \nThat sounds like a return to a Selina who is willing to partner up with the worst of the worst in Gotham City if it'll get her slightly ahead in life, as opposed to the Selina willing to do more altruistic things for Bruce or a friend like Ivy. Still, those things will remain a part of her, even as she enters what Bicondova calls \"a dark phase.\" \nGotham returns for a winter finale next Monday night at 8 p.m. ET/PT on FOX, then comes back to screens April 24, 2017 after 24: Legacy runs its first season in the same timeslot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:30:32.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
