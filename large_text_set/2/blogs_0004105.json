Your Freedom is an app that lets you browse while getting around these kinds of restrictions by locating your IP somewhere else. The tunneling protocols compatible with Your Freedom include HTTPS, HTTP/POST/CGI, FTP, UDP, DNS, and ICMP ECHO, so you won't have any trouble when opening any website. Also, the new IP identity can be located in one of nine different countries, using twenty-one servers in total. This app also offers a main data package for those who need only sporadic connectivity, but it can still be extended for those who need to use the app for a longer amount of time. You won't need to do any sort of setup to start browsing. Your Freedom will assign you a random country and server that you can change from the settings menu if necessary. With this app, you can connect to the Internet freely 24 hours a day and browse all the websites you wouldn't otherwise have access to, with no time limitations whatsoever.
