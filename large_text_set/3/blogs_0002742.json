Rangers are looking to appoint a new manager very soon having completed the interview process, according to Sky sources. \nThe Premiership club have spent the three weeks since Mark Warburton departed drawing up a blueprint for their new-look management structure. \nIt is understood a new director of football could be unveiled before the weekend with the club wanting to fill this vacancy first. Southampton director of recruitment Ross Wilson is believed to be in the frame. \nSSNHQ also understands Gary Rowett met with the Rangers CEO and managing director on Tuesday. They discussed the role and the rebuilding job needed at the club in terms of Academy, scouting and coaching structure. \nRowett is one of a number of candidates under consideration. \nNorwich manager Alex Neil has also been backed to become the next permanent manager, alongside Alex McLeish. \nPortuguese manager Pedro Caixinha and former Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew are other potential candidates. \nSky Sports News HQ reporter Charles Paterson said on Tuesday that Norwich boss Neil has the right credentials but pointed out that the betting market has been volatile since the departure of Warburton. \n\"I think he [Neil] fits the template of what they are trying to do at Rangers,\" Paterson reported from Glasgow. \n\"They want a young coach in, a really aspirational coach, someone who knows the Scottish game, who can work alongside a director of football.\" Ross Wilson is backed to become a success at Rangers if appointed as director of football \nGraeme Murty remains the man in charge for now and the relieved caretaker boss praised his under-fire players as they ended a miserable month with victory over St Johnstone on Wednesday night. \nThe 10-man Light Blues had Emerson Hyndman to thank for his stoppage-time winner after blowing a two-goal lead . \nTheir 3-2 triumph was their first league win since the end of January and sees them trim second-placed Aberdeen's lead back to six points. Alex Neil is being tipped to take over at Rangers \n\"The main emotion is relief that a group of players who fully deserved the win managed to come off with three points,\" said Murty. \n\"It's an easy stick to beat footballers with to say they don't care, that they are overpaid and don't care about the shirt. But our guys' reaction tonight will reveal that to be a lie and I'm really happy for them. \n\"They have taken a bit of a shoeing over the last few weeks. But they are going out of here with a good result in difficult circumstances, so I'd like to pat them on the back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T09:26:32.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
