And the upset is particularly puzzling since the Trump White House is simply keeping a promise then-president Barack Obama made to thoroughly vet such refugees; a promise he then broke. \nWhen the Obama administrationbegan importing refugees from war-torn Syria, the American people were assured that this humanitarian gesture posed no risk to them. People coming to the United States would have to undergo an 18-24 month vetting process that would weed out potential terrorists. Press Secretary Josh Earnest guaranteed us that “those individuals who seek to enter the United States through the refugee resettlement program do so only after undergoing the most intensive screening of anybody who attempts to enter the United States.\" \nBut Obama administration officials soon cast doubt on the effectiveness of the vetting process. FBI Director James Comey told Congress in October 2015 that he couldn’t “sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this.” The Department of Homeland Security warned about the Islamic State printing false documents to help move across international borders. As late as last summer CIA Director John Brennan testified that ISIS “has a large cadre of Western fighters who could potentially serve as operatives for attacks in the West” and that the group was “exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the West, including refugee flows, smuggling routes and legitimate methods of travel.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T18:51:05.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
