His favorite match of the year actually included a member of the shield, just one that calls Monday Night RAW his home. \nIn a recent interview with AL.com , Styles spoke on a variety of subjects, including his favorite match of 2016. You might assume it would be his WrestleMania match with Chris Jericho, but you would be wrong. To be clear though, he still loves that match. \nStyles said \"I have a lot of great matches in 2016. There are some I was real proud of. With Roman Reigns -- and don't get me wrong, WrestleMania was also a big one, too -- but I just felt like my matches with Roman Reigns set the tone of how AJ Styles was going to be presented in 2016, like this guy who gets after it and has great matches with just about anyone on the roster.\" \nAs for what 2017 has in store, he hopes to get into some programs with superstars like Randy Orton and Bray Wyatt, and made it clear that at some point before they retire, he will work with Seth Rollins. \n\"The great thing about it is there are so many options for me because I've only been here a year and worked with a certain amount of guys. Randy Orton and Bray Wyatt and all those guys I'm going to have the opportunity to get in the ring with. And Seth Rollins is on that list as well. That's going to happen. There's no doubt. At some point this year, hopefully, there will be another draft. And whatever happens, at some point, before him and I both retire, we're going to see each other in the ring. There's no doubt about it.\" \nStyles will next be seen at the Royal Rumble in a WWE Championship match against John Cena. Royal Rumble airs on the WWE Network January 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:31:01.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
