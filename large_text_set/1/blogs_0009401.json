We ask the Romford Pele 10 questions about Arsenal's infamous undefeated season… and find out his memory isn't as good as you might think Share Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Get Arsenal   \nRay Parlour was part of the most successful, most famous season any Arsenal team has ever had. \nFor those of you new to the sport of football, that side was Arsenal's Invincibles of 2003/04 - the squad who won the Premier League without losing a single game. \nIt was perhaps the most impressive achievement in English football history, achieved by a group of amazing players that included the likes of Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires.
