The only catch is that customers must meet the minimum requirement of $50 per order. To take advantage of the deal, customers just need to input the coupon code “BIGTHANKS” at the digital checkout.\nAs boasted by the Seattle-headquartered corporation itself, this is Amazon’s second straight win and it has ranked in the top 10 for nine straight years.

Amazon touted that respondents rated the company as \"excellent\" in all six categories.\nAmazon also ranked number two --just behind Apple--on Fortune ‘s World Most Admired Companies list published this month.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter.\nAmazon amzn routinely gains attention for significant discounts, not just on products in general compared to store shelves or even buying items in bulk, but also through its flash discounts year-round, during the winter holiday season , and even its own “Prime Day” discount event, a sort of Black Friday-in-July .\nRelated: Amazon's Convenience Store Without Checkout Lines Will Sell Beer and Wine \nBut Amazon was much quieter about another discount made earlier this week.\nIn a blink-and-miss-it move, the online retail giant quietly reduced its free shipping minimum rate to $35 just in time for Presidents Day, although the rate will last indefinitely.\nAmazon’s free shipping rate --arguably one of the company’s most popular promotions--has gone up and down over the years. The free shipping minimum has been as low as $25 in the past and was most recently as high as $49. The rate has gone up in recent years as Amazon continues to nudge consumers to subscribing to its Prime subscription service, which free two-day shipping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:40:46.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
