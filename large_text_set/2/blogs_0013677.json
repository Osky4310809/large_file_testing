King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 8 hours ago 16 \nAn interesting little compilation has surfaced via Music Radar , showcasing a variety of guitar icons discussing their least favorite aspect of wielding the six-string. \nThese include the likes of Joe Satriani, Brian \"Head\" Welch, Zakk Wylde, Ben Weinman, and more. \nYou can check out the rundown below, consult the source for the whole thing. Joe Satriani - changing strings \n\"Man, I hate changing strings. There should be some sort of iPhone app. I only ever do it when I have to. Very often, my engineers will go, 'What the hell guitar was that and why does it sound so funny?' And I'm like, 'Well, the strings are four months old, and I didn't bother changing them before I played that solo!'\" Ben Weinman (The Dillinger Escape Plan) - plugging and unplugging gear \n\"I would have to say my biggest gripe with playing guitar is putting my rig together on fly dates. I just really hate plugging and unplugging all my gear, night after night after night, when we are playing on rented gear that isn't ours. \n\"Luckily, at least when we play or tour through the States, I have my own rig out with me, all tied into my rolling head case, so there is very little troubleshooting when something goes wrong!\" Brian 'Head' Welch (Korn) - writer's block \n\"I hate getting writer's block; that's the biggest frustration for me. Writer's block makes me cringe. I can't stand getting into a room with other musicians and you can't come up with anything good. I hate it as well when I'm at home on my own trying to write and nothing will come up. \n\"I've had times where I just say, 'This is not working right now; I'm going to walk away.' I'll come back and the ideas will flow out like a river.\" Marten Hagstrom (Meshuggah) - me \n\"That's easy: I would say the biggest thing that sucks about playing guitar is... me! Hands down. I would prefer to be better at my instrument than I am right now. \n\"Out of all the things I complain about, like a G-string that's been incorrectly packaged by the manufacturer or my nickel allergy which means my hand can start bleeding on some tours, it's my own shortcomings that I get most frustrated about. I can get close, but sometimes I can't get exactly where I need to be in order to deliver what I want. I don't have time to practice one single lick, there's so much going on and shit needs to get done!\" John 5 - flying with your instrument \n\"I'd have to say traveling and flying with your instrument. Sometimes they won't let you bring it with you on the flight and you have to put it in the hold or whatever. I love being a guitarist and I don't really have any issues at all... it's my love and I enjoy it. So making sure my equipment gets everywhere when I need it and in good condition is the only really annoying thing for me!\" Zakk Wylde - herpes, venereal diseases, crabs and even syphilis \n\"I would have to say the worst thing about playing guitar is all the catching herpes, venereal diseases, crabs and even syphilis. All of that kinda stuff is a big problem for us; it can get pretty rough and damn expensive to get fixed up. \n\"Forget about how impressive your guitar equipment is for a second and let's start talking medical bills, bro! It's like you go and play a keg party, you hook up with Julie the Town Whore, and the next thing you know, you've caught gonorrhea and syphilis. It's terrible, man... terrible!\" Joe Duplantier (Gojira) - all the technical stuff \n\"I don't know much about the gear that's out there, I'm not able to explain the technical specs of any guitar like the pickups or wood. Just give me the guitar and I'll beat the shit out of it! \n\"I'm not a nerd that tries to understand that stuff. It's very primitive. I don't even really consider myself as a guitar player, but more of a producer. I see guitar players that go into a studio and are obsessed with their gear. For me, when it's time to record, I just run around, try to find my guitar, quickly get it all working and wrestle it into submission.\" Matt Heafy (Trivium) - struggling to learn classical guitar \n\"Currently, it's how much time I've been putting into trying to learn classical guitar. The fingerpicking and reading music and everything else. I put so much time into guitar that when I can't pick something up quickly I get frustrated. \n\"Maybe I just need more patience. Classical guitar is something I've always wanted to learn, and I've been working on it, taking lessons and practicing on the road but I need to work more on it, and my slow progress frustrates me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:41:56.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
