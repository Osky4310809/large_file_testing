They show a distressed Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) gripping her son Will (Noah Schnapp), who is still adjusting to life after being rescued from the Upside Down, as well as a new character, Max (Sadie Sink,) who is said to have a complex and suspicious past.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly , “Stranger Things” creators Ross and Matt Duffer said although they envisage the show running for many seasons, they’re already thinking about the perfect ending.\n“Everything changes as we move forward so we’ll see,” Ross Duffer said. “I want it to have a really finite ending. I don’t want it to be one of those shows that runs out of gas and they lose it because they’re losing interest. You wanna end when you’re on top,” Matt Duffer added.\nCheck out the new pics above.\nIn other news, an authorized Notorious B.I.G. documentary is coming very soon.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:59:10.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
