(Boeing via Twitter) Let history record that America’s first late-night astronaut is … Stephen Colbert?\nIn a pre-recorded bit due to be broadcast tonight on CBS’ “Late Show,” Colbert wears the spacesuit designed for crews on Boeing’s Starliner space taxi and does his shtick at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with Boeing’s Chris Ferguson as straight man.\n“How does it feel to be the first honorary Starliner astronaut?” he asks in one clip. “I’ve made it. This is what all of this comedy work has been leading up to: wearing a very tight jumpsuit with a really big inflatable butt on it.”\nEven United Launch Alliance did a double-take over Colbert’s fling with Starliner fame. “Wait. What?” ULA, the joint venture formed by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, said in a tweet .\nDoes @StephenAtHome have The Right Stuff to become Astro Stephen? Only @Astro_Ferg knows. Watch @ColbertLateShow 2/24, 11:35pm EST pic.twitter.com/PvKGNaHadc \n— Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) February 24, 2017 \nMaybe it shouldn’t be surprising that Colbert occasionally wants to scratch a spaceflight itch. He’s arguably the only comedian to have a piece of space hardware named after him: the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill, or COLBERT .\nIn his honor, the name on Boeing’s StarlinerOne test vehicle was changed, at least temporarily, to ColbertOne.\nBoeing is developing the CST-100 Starliner for NASA’s use, to carry up to seven astronauts to and from the International Space Station. If all proceeds according to schedule, the Starliner will start flying astronauts in 2018 (or maybe 2019).\nMeanwhile, SpaceX is adapting its Dragon cargo spaceship to carry crew, on roughly the same timeline. Will Colbert pay a visit to SpaceX as well? And if so, what color of spacesuit will he model? Stay tuned … and in the meantime, enjoy these tweets.\nColbert One is kind of a catchy name. Maybe we’ll keep it. \nWatch @ColbertLateShow 11:35 pm EST tonight! #Starliner #LSSC #BoeingSpace pic.twitter.com/5yQfygBT66 \n— Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) February 24, 2017 \n3… 2… 1… #LIFTOFF !
