Representatives, Chief Emeka Ihedioha, has described Governor Rochas Okorocha’s threat to banish the traditional ruler of Obinugwu autonomous community, Eze Cletus Ilomuanya, as “indeed disturbing, reckless and very unbecoming of a governor of a state in a position of leadership in a democratic nation like Nigeria.” \nIhedioha, who made his feelings known through his media aide, Mr. Chibuike Onyeukwu, also insisted that Ilomuanya did not err by approaching the courts to ventilate his displeasure at the unlawful dissolution of the Imo State Council of Traditional Rulers, under his chairmanship, by Okorocha. *Okorocha \n“Having won his case up to the Supreme Court, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mallam Abubakar Malami, directed in a letter to the governor that Eze Ilomuanya be accorded full rights and privileges, but he (Okorocha) dismissed the Federal Government’s directive with a wave of the hand,” Ihedioha said. \nIt was the considered opinion of Ihedioha that “adopting self-help by threatening to banish a highly revered monarch of Eze Ilomuanya’s standing, is laughable, primitive, unfortunate and constitutes an affront on rule of law.” \nIhedioha urged Okorocha to realize that power is transient and that he cannot be wiser than many of the justices that reviewed his illegal actions, stressing that it was ironic that a beneficiary of judicial pronouncements, such as the 2013 governorship election, will always find it convenient to constantly disrespect valid pronouncements of the courts, as if it is a parastatal of the state government. \nIhedioha then called on the Federal Government to beam it’s searchlight on the flagrant abuse of rule of law and other illegalities going on in Imo State. \nIllegality cannot beget legality \n—Ilomuanya \nReacting also through his media consultant, Mr. Kennedy Eweama, the royal father, Eze Ilomuanya, fumed that “the problem with the present administration in Imo State is that it finds pleasure in illegality and unlawful conduct.” \nIlomuanya was also irked that the leadership finds it convenient to stand laws on its head, in so far as it serves its infamous purposes. \nThe royal father referred the governor to pages 13, 18 and 21 of the Appeal Court judgment of July 5, 2013, adding that illegality cannot beget legality. \nAccording to Eze Ilomuanya, “for the governor to disobey the valid and lawful directive of the Federal Government, through the Attorney General of the Federation is not only an affront but also a recipe for lawlessness.” \nContinuing, the royal father said: “The peace, unity, stability and progress of Nigeria and any of her component states, is more important to Nigerians than the personal desires of Governor Okorocha, who wants to rule Imo as his fiefdom where no contrary view is tolerated”.
