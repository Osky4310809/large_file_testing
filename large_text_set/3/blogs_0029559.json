I suppose it was only a matter of time before these two, magical things converged to create the ultimate, dreamy (and OK, kind of unique) sex toy . Let’s face it; everyone is crazy over unicorn-themed anything. It is our millennial need to believe we will never be adults — unicorn sex toys are both sexually empowering and cute. We live in a world where sex positivity is en vogue and novelty toys are a plenty ( chili pepper emoji vibes , a dragon dildo sword, and sex toy lines specifically catered to Fifty Shades — to name a few), it’s no wonder this latest invention would make its debut. That’s right. Thank the heavens above, handmade unicorn dildos have arrived.

No, just me? Geek Sex Toys, a novelty online sex toy retailer is selling these ribbed, almost frighteningly realistic (if unicorns were, well, real ) unicorn dildos for $50 a pop. Given these are probably the coolest thing that have ever come into existence, I’d say that’s a steal. The horns, made of medical-grade silicone, come in a variety of majestic colors (lavender purple, pearly white, and soft baby pink), and are 7.5 inches long and 5.5 inches wide at the base, narrowing to two inches at the tip. We don’t know why they're so pointed at the top, though it's possible the creators are thinking women can use them for G-spot stimulation. We will ask. Though maybe it’s time we all up our sense of adventure and ride into the sunset. Loading View on Instagram The suction cup on the bottom of the dildos allows you to stick it on stuff, like a wall, the side of the shower, a chair. You can definitely get creative with these. What could be better than sexing yourself with a unicorn horn?
