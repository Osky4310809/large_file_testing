Last year two 18-year-olds died after taking illegal substances in the venue. \nAs the club opened its doors again after a huge campaign for it to be “saved”, medics walked up and down the length of the queue, announcing: \"If any of you or your friends are feeling unwell then please come and see us.\" \nClubbers queue as Fabric reopens its doors after a four month closure \nBouncers asked for identity documents to be out and ready and club staff reminded partygoers about their welfare areas. \nTravelling all the way from Virginia, America, Justin Watson said it was his first time visiting Fabric: \"We came from the States for the opening. Tightened security: the queue for Fabric (Getty Images) \n\"We have never been before and are both DJs and are trying to check out places before they close. \n\"I'm definitely excited - it's an institution.\" Warning: A sign outside Fabric on its reopening night (Getty Images) \nRicky Payne from Hayes, west London, said its reopening is \"brilliant\" and \"absolutely amazing\". \nThe 27-year-old added: \"Where else do we have to go? It is the best club in the world - an institution.\" \nOn the issue of drugs, he said it has \"always been strict\" but he said \"people got them in\". Tighter security greeted clubbers at Fabric (Getty Images) \nLuke Peasland, 25, from Colchester, Essex, said the reopening is the \"best thing that could happen\", while Matt Springeett, 25, from Ipswich added of the club's reputation for drug use: \"It is a minority ruining it for everyone.\" \nOthers said they feared the atmosphere could be “ruined” by the clampdown on drugs. \nA couple from London, in their early 20s, said: “The amnesty boxes are a nice idea but I doubt they will be used. \n\"You need to understand what you are taking really if you come to a place like this.\" \nA 29-year-old Italian woman added: “It's about time it reopened. I don't think it was Fabric's fault that led it to be shut. \n\"Instead of a drugs amnesty box there should be testing kits on site so people can check what they are taking is safe. \n\"There could also be more information about drugs and the safe way to enjoy them, rather than pretending people shouldn't bring any in at all.\" Saved from closure: Nightclub Fabric (Getty) \nAnother clubber, named only as Kristof, said: \"Whilst the hour-long queue waiting for people to search you from top to bottom was a sobering experience, the atmosphere as you entered into room 1 for the first time in several months made you realise why it was all worth it. \n\"There was no sense of animosity; just a resonating sense of joy that the venue was once again able to cater itself to the needs of London's buzzing underground scene, and that the culture of electronic music was accepted as an important component of London's nightlife.\" \nScotland Yard, which had applied for the licence to be reviewed, said while police usually patrol nightlife in the area officers will be specifically stationed at Fabric \"to support the door team who may need our help\". \nSuperintendent Nick Davies said: \"As things settle down and it becomes business as normal for Fabric they will be subject of the same police and licensing visits as other clubs in the borough.\" \nJack Crossley, from Worcester Park, Surrey, died on the morning of August 6 after becoming unwell at the club. \nHis inquest, held earlier this week, heard he had smuggled drugs into the venue in his boxers before buying more inside. Club deaths: Jack Crossley and Ryan Browne \nRyan Browne died in hospital on June 25 after taking ecstasy on a night out at Fabric. \nHe died due to \"recreational drug use gone wrong\", his inquest was told. \nA sign at the entrance to the queuing area outside the club greeted punters with a polite request to \"respect our zero policy to drugs\". \nIt added: \"Anyone found with illegal drugs will be banned from the venue and reported to the police.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T11:56:26.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
