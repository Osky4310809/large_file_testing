Trump’s administration has called the plan “compassionate,” but Trump voters who rely on Meals on Wheels found, like those who benefit from the Affordable Care Act, that they might have voted against their own interests. \nTo highlight that, Uygur played a clip of a woman interviewed by CBS who has relied on Meals on Wheels since she had a stroke. She said she voted for the current president because she “was under the influence that he was going to help” her. When asked what she’d tell him, she said, “What if it was your mom?” \n“Mmm, yeah, but it isn’t his mom,” Uygur said. “It’s you.” \nHe went on to say that this disillusionment among Trump voters isn’t uncommon, then summed up the general feeling with this imitation: “I thought he was gonna cut somebody else’s program, not my program!” \nWatch above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:23:36.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
