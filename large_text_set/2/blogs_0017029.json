Challah for Hunger raises dough for hunger awareness Courtesy of Challah for Hunger \nCo-Presidents and co-founders Abby Kaiser and Elana Rosner distribute Challah. \nStudents in Challah for Hunger bake challah bread bi-weekly and use the ‘dough’ they raise from donations to assist those who are without food both in the State College community and on a national scale. \n“Our mission is to bring people together to bake and sell challah in an effort to raise funds and awareness,” Rebecca Fine, president of Challah for Hunger, said. \nFine (senior-education) said that there are roughly 35-40 orders for challah bread a week and last semester the organization raised approximately $500 to donate to the State College food bank and Mazon. She said orders have increased for the current semester. \nMazon was the first national organization to involve the American Jewish community around the cause for hunger, according to their website. Jenna Bailin, vice president of Challah for Hunger, said Mazon is currently funding the Campus Hunger Project, which focuses on helping students on college campuses with food insecurities. \n“We also like to make an impact on a local level so every chapter chooses a local hunger agency or food bank near them to donate to,” Bailin (sophomore-elementary education) said. \nFine said the organization offers a laidback and fun environment for students to hang out and release stress they may be facing. She said students do not need prior cooking skills to join and everyone is welcome to bake. \n“I love the sense of community that is there,” Rachel Rubinstein said. \nRubinstein (freshman-education) oversees the baking of the organization — she ensures that both kitchens run smoothly and checks inventory, she said. The club meets to bake every other Thursday at 4:30 at the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center, she said, and the bread can be picked up the following day by those who placed orders. \nRubinstein said challah bread is typically eaten at Shabbat dinners held on Friday nights after a blessing is given on it. \nMembers of Challah for Hunger meet on a bi-weekly basis to bake various kinds of challah bread together — including plain and chocolate chip plus an additional specialty flavor, Bailin said. The specialty flavors range from Nutella to garlic to cookies and cream. \n“I really love to see how students can volunteer both their time and donate their money to support a great cause,” Bailin said. “I think there is definitely a big impact we can make if we work together.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:29:59.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
