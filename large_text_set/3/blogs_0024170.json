(Monica D'Ippolito/BSMG) \nThe Wildecats got on the board in the bottom of the first when Sydney McNamara knocked in Jane Hilger with an RBI single to give her team the, 1-0, lead. The Scorpions tied up the score in the top of the second, and nearly took the 2-1 advantage, but an interference call erased a would-have-been run by Zoe Smith. \nAfter taking the lead in the third, Wilde Lake added three more in the fourth inning, with Jasper Killian, Leslie and McNamara all scoring. \nThe Wildecats then put away the game in the seventh inning. Scorpions’ pitcher Shayla Love, who ultimately struck out five batters in the complete game, had a tough time getting her pitches over the plate. Four consecutive walks helped the Wildecats earn seven runs in the inning and take a commanding 13-4 lead. \n“We played strong defense. We hit the ball well, [but] we gave up too many bases,” said Oakland Mills coach Skip Yarn. “We simply gave up too many walks and hit a couple batters and that got us into trouble. It seemed like we were always giving up the free bases to the 7, 8 and 9 [hitters], so we would come back to their 1, 2, 3 and that hurt us.” \nA photo gallery preview of all 13 Howard County softball teams heading into the 2017 season. (BSMG) (Monica D'Ippolito) \nOakland Mills battled back in the top of the sixth, as Emily Houk, Smith, Elizabeth Yu and Love all crossed home to cut the deficit, 13-8 heading into the seventh. \nWilde Lake capitalized off more walks in the bottom of the sixth inning, as Kayleigh Gladden, Leslie and McNamara all scored runs to extend the cushion further. \n“We just kept saying, ‘be patient,’” Dronenburg said. “They have the tendency to get a little anxious and rush themselves, so we just kept saying be patient. We’ll take a walk. A walk is just as good as a hit.” \nOakland Mills crossed a run in the top of the seventh, but Kasey Baird closed out the game to earn the victory for the Wildecats, who went winless all of last season. (Monica D'Ippolito) \n“We came into this season saying this is it. This is the year,” Dronenburg said. “We have a really talented group of younger girls and a really talented group of older girls, the seniors, so it is just a really nice mix, really nice balance. They are getting along awesome as a team, which is helping them produce as a team on the field.” \nKillian and McNamara each had three runs on the day, while Rachel Van Osdel finished with a base hit in the game. \n“I think teams often underestimate us and I think this win will help us show other teams in the county that we are more competitive this year and that we are coming to play,” Leslie said. “I am really excited for the rest of the season.” \nThe Scorpions recorded 10 hits in the game, led by leadoff hitter Smith who went 4-for-4 at the plate, with a double, three runs and an RBI, while Faith Tacey added three base hits on the day. \n“I thought Zoe played real well. She ‘s a good hitter, but we got hits up and down the lineup. Most of them were not deep but decent hits up and down the line up,” Yarn said. “Less walks, we got to pitch a little bit better. We’ve got to hit the strike zone. If we can pitch so they can hit then I believe our defense will keep us in games. \n“They’ve got a good team. We look forward in meeting them at the end of the year. Hopefully we’ll be ready.” \nWilde Lake 16, Oakland Mills 9 \nWL (1-1 county, 1-1 overall), OM (0-2, 0-2) \nOM — 0 1 0 0 3 4 1 9 10 4 \nWL — 1 0 2 3 7 3 x 16 6 11 \nLove and Yu \nCentennial 8, Howard 6 \nC (2-0 county, 2-0 overall), Ho (0-1, 0-1) \nThe Eagles outlasted the visiting Lions Thursday and collected their second consecutive win of the season. \nHoward got off to a hot start, taking advantage of two early errors in the first inning. Emma Braswell tripled to left field, scoring Shanya Gordon and Julia Colton. On the very next play, second basemen Sarah Phelps completed a double play to clear the bases. Shortstop Lauren Marcotte threw Paige Eakes out at first to get the final out of the inning. \nIn the bottom of the first, the Eagles scored four runs and never gave up the lead. Grace Bennett (2-3, 2 runs, BB) walked and was advanced on a bunt single by Sarah Sopchick (1-4). Marcotte (3-4, 2B, 3 RBI, 2 runs) singled to short left field and loaded the bases. Celina Jensen (2-4, 2 RBI) followed with a single on a full count to push Bennett and Sopchick across the plate. Olivia Reese (1-4) hit a hard ground ball up the middle, which is mishandled by Howard pitcher Ally Wieman, allowing Reese to reach first and load the bases for the second time in the inning. Carrie Strott (2-3, RBI) singled to score Marcotte and keep the bases juiced. Reese then scored the fourth run of the inning on a passed ball. \nFollowing a good plate performance, the defense put together a clean inning and Jensen retired the side in order on three consecutive ground ball plays. \nThe following innings were well defended by both teams. Jordan Hinz made a spectacular diving catch in right field to rob Gordon of a base hit. Marcotte followed with a gem of her own, making a diving catch to end the third inning. \nCentennial scored again in the bottom of the fourth. Hinz (1-2, SAC) singled with one out, which Bennett followed with a single of her own. Sopchick grounded out to the right side to advance Hinz and Bennett to third and second, respectively. Marcotte then drove in Hinz on a single up the middle. \nThe Eagles added important insurance runs in the sixth. Sara Phelps (1-3, run) led off with a single to centerfield and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Hinz. Bennett followed with a single and advanced Phelps to third. Bennett then moved to second base on defensive indifference to put two runners in scoring position for Marcotte, who doubled to deep right field to score two runs. Jensen followed with a single to advance Marcotte, who eventually scored on an errant throw. \nThe Lions fought back in the top of the seventh as they started off the inning with three-straight hits. Howard picked up three runs, but could not complete the rally. \n“This was a hard fought game and we played some great defense behind Celina Jensen,” said Centennial coach Katie Grimm. “She really pitched to her defense and let them make plays for her. At the plate we were ready to hit and I’m really happy with how well we hit with runners in scoring position. Our hitters put together great at-bats which was a big improvement from the previous game.” \nGordon led Howard offensively, going 3-for-4 at the plate and scoring two runs. Wieman went 1-for-4 on the day with 2 RBI, while Braswell went 1-for-4 with a triple and 2 RBI. \nHo — 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 6 9 3 \nC — 4 0 0 1 0 3 x 8 11 4 \n\nLong Reach 8, Atholton 0 \nLR (1-0 county, 1-0 overall), A (0-2, 0-2) \nThe Lightning started out the season strong Thursday, shutting out the visiting Raiders to clinch the 8-0 win. \nRachel Jacavage earned the shut out for Long Reach, striking out three and only walking three. Kamryn Walker went 4-for-4 with four singles, a stolen base and three runs scored, while Kasey White went 2-for-4 with two singles and 2 RBI. \nDefensively, the Lightning had two double players — a 1-2-3 double play and a 6-3 double play to keep all runners from scoring. \nA — 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nLR — 2 0 0 0 2 4 x \n\nGlenelg 14, Mt.

Hebron came out scoring with a solo homerun by Kieran Davis in the first inning and followed it up with a run every inning until the fourth. \nDown by three, Glenelg fought back at the bottom of the fourth inning, starting with a single by Erin Cauley. The Gladiators almost went through their batting order twice in the inning and scored 12 runs. \nKathryn Hoffman drove in Cauley and Molly Dustin to get Glenelg on the board. Katie McInyre then broke a 4-all tie after hitting a two-run double off the Vikings’ Riley Kinsella. The Gladiators ended the inning with a 12-3 lead and added two more runs in the fifth to end the game after five innings played. \nAmy Stetser earned the win for the Gladiators. She pitched five innings and gave up four runs, five hits and struck out four. \nThe Gladiators collected 15 hits in the game. McIntyre, Dustin, Emily Michalski, Katie Grimm, Kathryn Hoffman and Stetser each had multiple hits. \nMt. Hebron had five hits in the game, with Hoskinson and Dave each finishing with multiple hits. \nMH — 1 1 1 1 0 4 5 3 \nG — 0 0 0 12 2 14 15 3 \n\nHammond 9, Reservoir 5 \nHa (2-0 county, 2-0 overall), Re (0-1, 0-1) \nThe Golden Bears picked up their second win of the season Thursday, defeating the visiting Gators, 9-5. \nHammond took the lead in the bottom of the first inning and added two more runs in the third, but Reservoir stormed back in the top of the fourth, scoring four runs to take the one-score lead. But the Golden Bears put together two productive innings in the fifth and sixth to pull away with the win. \nBrittany Brewer went 2-for-3 with two singles and 2 RBI for the Golden Bears, while Taylor Ligiori went 3-for-4 with two doubles, a single and 2 RBI. Bethany Hewitt went 2-for-3 with a single and a double, while Armonie Lane went 2-for-4 with two singles.
