The model, based in Paris, wears labels from the likes of Hermès, Alexander Wang, MM6, Fila, Maison Margiela, Champion, Airness, Schott, Adidas, Supreme and Chanel.\nWe asked Anita a handful of questions in order to get to know her a little more. See what she had to say below and check out our previous installment with Patricia Manfield .\nWho or what are you currently inspired by? \nLately, I’ve been inspired by Selena Gomez because of her style and personality. I’ve been following her since the beginning and I’m a big fan. A lot of people criticize her because they still have this image of her as a little girl from the Disney Channel. But I admire her for her talent and the fact that she hasn’t lost herself like Miley.\nDescribe your current style. \nMy style depends mostly on my mood. I can go very simple when I don’t have many ideas but when I’m in the mood I can mix and match a lot of different styles. I don’t really care about what people think, I don’t dress for them but for myself.\nIf you weren’t in your current city, where would you live? \nIf I wasn’t living in Paris it would be Los Angeles for sure because of atmosphere and lifestyle. It’s a little dream to go live there.\nWhich Emoji best represents you? \nThe rose. I use it all the time.\nWho is the film character you’re most like? \nSydney White because of her determination.\nDescribe your perfect day. \nChilling with my lover, watching movies, what else.\nWhat is something you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time, but haven’t yet? \nA long road trip with my closest friends in the U.S. exploring and having fun!\nWhat album do you currently have on repeat? \nThe last one from Future is so cool, I love it!\nWhat is your most treasured possession? \nThe two chains around my neck, I got them from my beloved grandmother.\nWhat could you eat every day and not get tired of? \nI’m always craving Asian food. I’m part Vietnamese and I was raised with all those amazing flavors.\nWhere do you want to be in the next five years? \nWorking in fashion, maybe an editor and a bit of modeling hopefully.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T15:49:44.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
