Owner Chris Quinn has applied for a liquor license for the empty storefront at 3169-3175 N. Elston Ave. Quinn confirmed, saying that they’re a couple months away from any type of opening. Quinn declined to provide further details, only saying that the new tavern and The Beer Temple would be “all in one place.” He said more information will be available next month. The location for the tavern is just around the corner from The Beer Temple’s existing spot. Quinn has also applied for a liquor license for the new space. The natural conclusion, given Quinn’s comments, would be that The Beer Temple is moving retail operations into the new and larger space. Again, Quinn, didn’t confirm that assumption. The Beer Temple is a destination for Chicago craft beer drinkers in Avondale. The store opened four years ago, stocking an impressive selection of hard-to-find beer. The tavern is just down the street from two other craft beer spots: DMen Tap and the original Kuma’s Corner. Given The Beer Temple’s industry connections, as Quinn hosts his own beer podcast drawing craft beer experts from all over the country, the upcoming tavern should have quite the tap list. It’s an intriguing piece of beer news as the Chicago Beer Festival takes place this weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:50:51.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
