Bars That Opened in 2016, Plus One Honorable Mention \nSen. Scott Wiener's recent bill, the Let Our Communities Adjust Late Night Act, would allow municipalities to extend serving hours with the approval of the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Cities could, if they wished, extend hours only on certain days of the week or only on specified holidays, according to the bill. They also could limit the hours to \"specific areas\" of town. \nWiener argues that those two extra hours could provide a lot of extra business for the state's multibillion-dollar hospitality industry. Wiener notes that New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Miami, Las Vegas and New Orleans are among the major U.S. cities that allow drinking later than 2 a.m. \nThe bill is backed by the California Restaurant Association and the California Music & Culture Association, among other groups. The music and culture group's co-chair, Ben Bleiman, said in a statement, \"Nightlife is a major economic and cultural driver in California.\" \n\"This bill represents a crucial opportunity for Californiaâ€™s cities and towns to choose to join the ranks of those across the country and the world offering truly world-class nightlife for their residents and visitors,\" he said. \nAlthough Wiener is a San Francisco Democrat, the nightlife industry in the state's largest city would stand to gain the most from two more hours of alcohol sales. The question is whether that extra booze would imperil people on the streets so early in the morning.
