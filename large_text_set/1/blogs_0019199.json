He doubled down on those promises late last year after the United Nations Security Council passed an anti-Israeli resolution condemning the Jewish State. \nThe resolution passed due in part to former President Barack Obama telling the American U.N. delegation to abstain from voting on it, which many saw as a snub to Israel. The vast majority of members of Congress and Americans were outraged by the move, which was seen as a break from standard U.S. foreign policy. \nIn addition, Trump and senior administration officials have repeatedly said they are considering moving the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Israel’s declared capital city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T23:37:50.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
