It hasn’t been a normal lifestyle for him. But he’s made the most of every opportunity he’s got to be where he is today,” Mr Cordner said. Roosters to justify the hype? 1:48 \n“It has been hard for him but the main thing for me was that I kept him in sport and it was the areas that I knew and it was the areas I knew his mother would want him to still be in, which was definitely rugby league, because we’re rugby league people. \n“(But also) surf club, fishing, beaches, he’s also a keen cricketer, he loved his cricket. \n“But the main thing was to keep him grounded and keep him involved in sports. It was pretty hard but that’s what I had to do.” \nClick on the video at the top of the page to watch the heart warming story in full! \nWhile Cordner’s toughest times came as a kid, he has had more than his fair share of hardships since, with several serious injuries interrupting the first six years of the 24-year-old’s NRL career. \nStill, the game has started to reward him for his ability to respond to adversity, with a handsome new contract, club captaincy and potentially the opportunity to lead his state this year. \nClearly he’s grateful for everything his father did for him to make it all possible, deciding to repay him with an enormously generous gesture — a beachside townhouse in his home town of Old Bar. \n“That’s when Boyd said, ‘look Dad, I’ve just signed a new deal, I’m in a position where I’d like to invest, so look for a house and I’ll buy one’,” Mr Cordner said. \n“It’s something I didn’t expect but something that he wanted to do. \n“There’s another side of Boyd, he’s got a massively big heart. He’s good to his mates, good to his friends, good to his family.” Boyd Cordner braces for contact as he runs the ball against the Dragons. Source: News Corp Australia \nFor Cordner’s part he says his dad “deserves everything he can get”. \n“It obviously wasn’t easy growing up without a mum and coming from Old Bar there was a lot of family back there,” he said. \n“I could sit here all day and talk about me dad and how good he is and he deserves everything he can get. \n“It’s not until you’re a bit older and you can look back and you sort of take it for granted what he done for me and me brother and when you get a bit older you start to look back and appreciate it a bit more. \n“To see what he had to go through and to understand it a bit better when you’re older, it’s pretty amazing what he done and I can’t thank him enough for the opportunity he’s given me and my brother also.” \nLive stream the Roosters’ round one clash with the Titans on FOX SPORTS.
