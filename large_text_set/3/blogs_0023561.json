Vance joins Revolution LLC to promote startups outside of Silicon Valley \nStation F is going to be the world’s biggest startup campus. A thousand startups are going to work in this huge building. And Station F wants to partner with the biggest tech companies, such as Zendesk , so that young startups don’t even have to pay to be there. \n“By now, everybody knows where we are. We are at Station F, the world’s biggest startup campus. We will have a thousand startups surrounded by VCs, tech companies and experts,” Station F director Roxanne Varza said. “We’re talking with the best [tech companies] from all around the world and bringing them here.” \nSo what does it mean, bringing Zendesk to to Station F? First, Station F will be able to use Zendesk as their customer support tool for free. Second, the company’s team in paris is going to relocate to Station F (that’s 10 people or so). \nFinally, Zendesk is going to have its own tiny incubator with 47 desks inside Station F. Startups will be able to work there for free. Zendesk already announced a couple of startups that are going to work from its mezzanine inside Station F — SnapCall and Ottspot . \nEverything seems clear now. While you can pay around €195 per desk per month to enter Station F’s Founders Program , the campus would rather create a community with big tech companies and small tech companies working under the same roof. \nZendesk Director of Central and Southern Europe Gabriel Frasconi said that Zendesk isn’t paying a premium to sponsor these 47 desks. So the company is probably paying around €9,000 per month so that startups don’t have to. Station F backer Xavier Niel already said that he doesn’t want to make any money from this venture. \nOther partners include Facebook , HEC Paris and Vente-Privée. From what I’ve heard, there could be as many as 15 different partners all paying for a tiny chunk of Station F. \n“We need to create a big space to shed light on this ecosystem,” Niel said. “In order to do this, we need to have the best partners.” IMG_1258", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:40:23.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
