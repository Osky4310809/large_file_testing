Jackie Evancho , the 16-year-old opera singer who was one of the few performers at Donald Trump’s inauguration, is now speaking out against his decision to roll back protections for transgender students in public schools. Evancho, whose older sister, Juliet, is transgender, expressed her disapproval of the decision in two tweets on Wednesday, using the hashtag #sisterlove in her first tweet. \nhttps://twitter.com/jackieevancho/status/834556080378220545 Shortly after Juliet made her transition at age 17 in October 2015, the Evancho family spoke to People . Evancho’s father, Mike , told the magazine that their religious family has been supportive of Juliet’s journey from the beginning and is hopeful that her story will reach others. “Our hope is that by Juliet sharing her story and seeing that even a Catholic family such as ours can accept their child, that hopefully it can help at least one person learn to be able to accept who they truly are instead of going the way of suicide or trying to mask who they are on the inside with drugs and alcohol,” he said. President Trump’s decision to remove guidelines for transgender students put in place by the Obama administration has already received a great deal of backlash from other recognizable names. Ellen DeGeneres , Ellen Page , and Lance Bass were among the voices of dissent joining Evancho on Twitter. “For anyone who feels scared or hopeless, know that we will never stop fighting for your rights,” DeGeneres tweeted on Wednesday. Evancho’s dissent comes from a personal place. “I actually cried because what worried me was that [Juliet] was going to get teased,” Evancho told People in 2015. “She told me she was transgender, and I was actually very happy for her because she finally found herself, and she can be who she wants to be.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:58:09.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
