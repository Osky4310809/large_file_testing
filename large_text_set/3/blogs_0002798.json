Paige Matthews (Photo: SWNS.com) \nPaige, from South Wigston, made the emergency call after her mum had a fit, with blood coming out of her mouth. \nShe checked her mum's breathing and heartbeat and kept her eight-year-old brother Shaun calm until the paramedics arrived. \nThe Parkland Primary School pupil is to be given the Laverick Award, which recognises children and young adults who have gone above and beyond to help another. \nThe award is in memory of Nick Laverick â€“ a paramedic team leader who lost his battle with cancer on his 37th birthday in September 2013.

She is truly deserving of this award.\" \nFaye, 30, who was taken to hospital but discharged after tests, has since listened to a recording of the call between Paige and Aimee Hinds. \nThe mum-of-two, a learning disabilities support worker at a care home, said: \"It brought a tear to my eye. \n\"I listened to it with Paige at home and she got quite upset. \n\"It was amazing to hear how calm and brave she was.

She is a star.\" \nAimee also praised the schoolgirl. \nShe said: \"Paige was, without a doubt, the best child-caller I have ever spoken to. \n\"She remained brave throughout the call and was even able to care for her younger brother.
