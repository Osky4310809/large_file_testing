Ross did not clarify if that ruling would apply to either cooperative or competitive modes in the series going forward, nor did she clarify how split-screen modes would work in any potential \"Xbox Play Anywhere\" entries in Halo that work on Windows 10. (This month's Halo Wars 2 is the first true \"Play Anywhere\" game in the Halo series.) We have reached out to Microsoft to seek clarification, and we will update this report with any response.\n2015's Halo 5: Guardians was a peculiar release in the series for a few reasons, but one stands out to the couch-combat fans at Ars Technica: its lack of split-screen combat, either in four-player local versus modes or in its campaign, which revolved around four-player co-op battling (as opposed to many prior games that limited campaign co-op to two players). While the game was in development, a 343 developer told fans via Twitter that Halo 5 would include split-screen modes, but the studio eventually walked that statement back .\nRoss admitted that fan outcry over the feature was significant, telling the DICE crowd, \"it was incredibly painful for the community and for us.\" She added that the removal \"eroded trust\" with the game's fanbase. Weirdly, Ross didn't take the opportunity to speak about the other major ball dropped by 343 in regard to Halo : the woeful launch of the Master Chief Collection , which continues to inspire outrage from fans wanting its bugs and issues fixed.\nIf you're keeping track, Halo 6 has not yet been formally announced, but Ross' statement all but assures that some new Halo FPS is in development.
