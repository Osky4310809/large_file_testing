Even so, according to service providers, veterans still often have trouble connecting with service organizations or groups while acclimating to civilian life. \nOn Thursday, local veterans, city officials, and civilians joined together in east Houston to celebrate the grand opening of Combined Arms at 2929 McKinney St. \n\"In Houston, we are open for veterans,\" said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, among the 250 people who attended the event, and who with City Council proclaimed Jan. 26 \"Combined Arms Day.\" \nThe organization touts itself as a clearinghouse of services for veterans, and hopes to expand to other cities   eventually work with the Department of Defense to insure veterans have a clear idea of services they can access after transitioning off base and into their civilian communities.

The organization houses 10 veteran services organizations under its roof full time - and rent-free - and hosts 30 others part time, he said, explaining that the arrangement means veterans can walk into the organization, and receive a variety of services more quickly and efficiently. It also screens the legion of veteran support groups in Houston and points veterans towards the best ones, he said. \n\"We take the onus off the veteran to contact the organization,\" he said, adding that since Combined Arms opened its doors last year, more than 1,000 veterans had visited and the organization had made 2,300 referrals to at least 300 veterans who'd approached the non-profit seeking help or support.
