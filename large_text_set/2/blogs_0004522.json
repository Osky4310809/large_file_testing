Michael Jackson’s uncanny star power during the 1993 game between the Buffalo Bills and the Dallas Cowboys signaled a new entertainment era of televised halftime shows. \nDo you remember Michael Jackson’s historic Super Bowl performance? It was perhaps his greatest — and mostly widely viewed — entertainment feat before to his untimely death in 2009. Before he died, Michael Jackson was preparing yet another live music spectacle: a London concert series called This Is It . Sadly, the full concert residency never came to fruition, but its rehearsals and select performances were preserved in a documentary-concert film ( Michael Jackson’s This Is It , 2009). Read on the reminisce about Michael’s fondly-remembered Super Bowl show. Michael Jackson doing one of his signature dance moves at Super Bowl XXVII.

The paper recognized Michael’s importance in igniting the contemporary tradition of stellar Super Bowl music extravaganzas. \n“The King of Pop ushered in the new era of the halftime show with this performance, turning it into a must-see event for the first time.” \nMichael Jackson’s initial reveal during the historic performance is one of the oft-remembered entertainment aspects of the set. As recalled by the Detroit, Michigan, news source, Michael started his halftime set by first “appearing” at the top of the stadium (it was a body double, of course). Jackson then rocketed from center stage and stood completely still and silent for almost two minutes before beginning his performance. \n“What makes it even more stunning is that Jackson stands silent for nearly 2 minutes, while letting the crowd roar for him. He doesn’t utter a word until nearly 3 minutes into his 12-minute show. Yet he still manages to offer a plea for racial harmony and worldwide unity in the name of children.” Michael Jackson busts a move during his 1993 Super Bowl halftime show.
