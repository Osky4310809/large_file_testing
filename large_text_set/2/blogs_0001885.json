The Ironmen's Division I pledge found Dyshawn Jackson in the open court, and the defensive-minded junior looked for his more offensively geared twin brother down court. Delshawn corralled the pass in stride and drained a layup just before the buzzer sounded. \nThe No. 21 team in the cleveland.com boys basketball Top 25, Central Catholic (9-6, 4-2 North Coast League White Division) celebrated, while No. 5 Garfield Heights (12-4) also erupted once LeBron James strolled onto the court for warmups in preparation for tonight's Cavaliers-Timberwolves game. The Cleveland Central Catholic boys basketball team listens to coach Jordan Duke during a fourth-quarter timeout during their 64-62 victory against Garfield Heights on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena. The No. 21 Ironmen defeated the No. 5 Bulldogs on Delshawn Jackson's buzzer-beating layup. (Sam Robinson, Special to cleveland.com) \nDelshawn Jackson, who scored an team-high 19 points, helped Central Catholic avoid a third loss in four games, each time playing ranked competition. \n\"I knew [the defender] was coming full speed, so I had to get him off his feet a little bit,\" Delshawn Jackson said, describing his layup. \"I knew I had to make it to make up for [a] layup I just missed. This was a big win for our program.\" \nDelshawn missed a chance to give his team a two-point lead with 42 seconds remaining, giving Garfield Heights a go-ahead opportunity. But both of the Bulldogs' Division I commits -- Shawn Christian (Cleveland State) and Marreon Jackson (Toledo) -- couldn't convert open jumpers, setting up the Ironmen's winning basket. Marreon Jackson led all scorers with 22 points. \n\" When you shoot a long 3, you got to make sure you get back,\" Garfield Heights coach Sonny Williams said of his team's costly lapse. \"I don't think we did a good job of that. I thought it was a game we played really bad.\" \nCentral Catholic kept Marreon Jackson and Christian (11 points) from taking over. Marreon Jackson helped key a 12-0 Bulldogs run late in the first half, but a wing 3-pointer from Dion Ivory broke a tie and gave the Ironmen a 34-31 halftime advantage. \nSenior Ironmen forward Sh'ron Smith downed a corner triple off an Alex Heath kickout pass to end the third quarter. Central Catholic kept this lead until Marreon Jackson's 3-pointer made it 62-62. \nDyshawn Jackson finished with nine points, with Thomas and Tyler Golphin contributing 10 and 11, respectively, to the upset cause. Rhodes transfer forwards Brison Waller and Donovan Forte each scored 10 while making life tough on Ironmen rebounders. \nCentral Catholic will travel to face Warren John F. Kennedy on Friday night, while Garfield Heights plays at Medina on Saturday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:24:44.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
