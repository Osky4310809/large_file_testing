Event organizers insist that any attempts to wreak havoc will be subdued. \nProject Veritas’ James O’Keefe broke the news with a special investigation featuring undercover footage of the plotters hashing out plans to set off the sprinklers at the National Press Club. Another more sinister component of the operations is to infuse butyric acid, a key ingredient in stink bombs, into the building’s ventilation system. Butyric acid can be recognized as the compound that gives human vomit its foul stench. One of the conspirators, Luke Kuhn, of the so-called DC Anti-Fascist Coalition, was recorded saying, \"The message has to be, we do not recognize the city government either.

The FBI is investigating a criminal complaint \"right now,\" he noted. \n\"They seem to think it is just a prank, and I would refer them to the Department of Justice’s website—This is actually a felony. This isn’t funny at all, it is terrorism,\" Cernovich said. Some of the conspirators who purchased tickets to the Deploraball will be treated as criminals conspiring, and acting, to \"commit terrorism,\" he added. \"We are treating it like the serious criminal conspiracy that it is.\" ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T01:56:08.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
