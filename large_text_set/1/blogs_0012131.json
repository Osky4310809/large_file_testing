The new shop will be opening in the space formerly occupied by the Nüvonivo children’s clothing and toy store, which closed last summer , at 111 E. Hargett St. Read With Me, a children's bookstore and art shop, is expected to open at 111 E. Hargett… more c/o Empire Properties The bookstore is the brainchild of former Wake County Public School System teacher and librarian Christine Brenner , who has spent the last few years as a stay-at-home mom. Through a news release issued by Downtown Raleigh Alliance , Brenner said she hopes to have the store open by March and aims to create a place downtown for families to share their love of books. “I was fortunate to have teachers [who] inspired me and also to have a family that valued reading and always made sure I had access to books,” Brenner said. “Reading should be a shared, engaging experience between [an] adult and child that is an open interaction of sharing thoughts and asking questions.” The shop will be located between Briggs Hardware and Arrow Haircuts, and is less than one block from Marbles Kids Museum. DRA said Brenner plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign Jan. 16 to help raise necessary start-up funds for the new venture. Amanda Hoyle covers commercial and residential real estate.
