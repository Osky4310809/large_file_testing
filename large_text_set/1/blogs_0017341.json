It's unclear if the family knew who she was, but it appears unlikely.\nMalia went on the trip as part of a gap year before attending Harvard University in fall 2017. \nIt's not clear what career paths Malia may be interested in at this point -- but there's one she is, at current, most certainly not interested in: politics.\n“Neither of them intends to pursue a future in politics, and in that too, I think their mother’s influence shows,” President Obama said, Hollywood Life reports.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:51:48.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
