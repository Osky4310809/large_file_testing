This is Chris. A little over a year ago, Chris was in a motorcycle accident that damn near killed him. He recovered, luckily, and today is able to move on his own. Not everyone is so lucky. \nAs we close week one of the ChiveFit Challenge , it’s made me realize how lucky I am. Know that if you’re able to move your body, that’s something to celebrate. So run, lift, dance, whatever – just make use of what some people can’t. \nYou can show some support to Chris as he celebrates his way on his Instagram ! 39", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:24:49.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
