Ever swallowed a Lego brick? Those of you who answered no, I can assure you it’s not all that pleasant. If you really must eat a Lego brick, make sure it’s wrapped around a delicious burger.\nDoes such a thing exist? Of course, it does! Just head on down to Brick Burger and order up one of their Emmet-approved signature creations.\nWord of warning: your travel time may be a little longer than you’d like for a weekday burger run. See, Brick Burger is located in the Philippines . My apologies if that particular piece of information just ruined your dinner plans.\nBut don’t you adventurous Lego fanatics let a silly little thing like geography get in the way of you and one of these fantastic 2×2 brick burgers! Take your pick from tasty choices like the black-bunned Darth burger, the Cheesy Mac, the Nacho Tuesday, and the Wildstyle. For truly enormous appetites, order up a Lord Business — three patties covered in bacon and cheese and slathered with cheesy sauce and veg.\n\nWhat’s even better than a Lego-themed burger? How about the opportunity to win free Lego just for scarfing your burger down as fast as you can? Finish the Lord Business in a relatively comfortable three minutes and you get to choose from a variety of polybags.\nA time under 2:30 will earn you one of three seasonal Lego sets. Polish off your Brick Burger in less than 90 seconds and you’ll take home the Lego Creator Corner Deli. That’s a pretty sweet prize considering the Lord Business goes for about $9 at today’s exchange rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:55:39.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
