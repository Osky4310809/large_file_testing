As the pair flirted up a storm, Whitney mentioned Lauren’s boyfriend and baby but this didn’t deter Josh from giving Lauren his number again – as she had lost it last time – before tenderly kissing her as they parted ways.\n(Picture: BBC) Whitney urged Lauren not to throw everything away but Lauren seems to already have made her mind up – so are EastEnders lining up a sordid affair storyline for her which will leave Steven heartbroken? Or will she end up having a change of heart as she learns more about Josh?\nAfter all, some are already speculating how neat it seems that he is on Lauren’s radar when she has been complaining about having a dull relationship with Steven. At the same time, Max has been trying to build bridges with Steven, something which is already suspicious to many given Max’s secret revenge plot to bring down Albert Square.\n(Picture: BBC) Might Josh actually be working in cahoots with Max and is he really prepared to use his daughter as a pawn to get his own back?\nOr is Josh’s attraction to Lauren purely coincidental and organic?\nWhatever happens, things have only just started getting complicated – and someone is bound to get hurt!\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: A family is torn apart by an unexpected event that changes life forever \nMORE: 12 soap spoiler pictures: Corrie and Emmerdale tragedy, EastEnders disaster, Hollyoaks death ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:26:05.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
