The beautiful image reveals two gas-rich spiral galaxies as their destiny slowly unravels. \nNamed IRAS 14348-1447 after the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) responsible for its discovery the celestial object is the violent meeting of millions of stars after a gravitational tug of war created when they veered too close to each other. . @NASA_Hubble took this image of two doomed gas-rich spiral galaxies slowly and destructively merging into one: https://t.co/dbOwZyYBJH pic.twitter.com/6tEDj3SuzY — NASA (@NASA) January 10, 2017 \nLocated over a billion light years from Earth, IRAS 14348-1447 is known as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy, shining brightly in the infrared part of the spectrum. The huge amount of molecular gas present give it a whirling appearance, with tails and wisps. \nIn November last year another galactic collision was captured by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array radio telescopes in Chile. A galaxy known as IC 2163 glanced off another named NGC 2207 creating a violent but beautiful formation 114 million light years away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:22:22.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
