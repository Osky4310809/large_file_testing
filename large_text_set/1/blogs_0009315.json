In VW’s home continent, this SUV will be known as the Tiguan Allspace to differentiate it with the original. In China, it wlll be called the Tiguan L . \n“The new Tiguan demonstrates how we plan to give American customers the usability and versatility they demand without sacrificing style or Volkswagen’s trademark driving dynamics. Every detail of the Tiguan has been thoughtfully engineered for our US customers to maximise space and convenience, while retaining its performance, agility, and value. We plan to price Tiguan very competitively with other compact SUVs,” said Hinrich J. Woebcken, CEO of VW North America. \nAs with the also-new but larger Atlas , the Tiguan is based on Volkswagen’s Modular Transverse Matrix (MQB) platform. Compared with the second-generation Tiguan , the Allspace has far more space; at 4,704 mm, the seven-seater is 272 mm longer and has up to 57% more cargo capacity, VW says. \nThe Allspace’s 2,791 mm wheelbase has been stretched by 112 mm, and besides the third row of seats (standard in FWD models, optional on AWD versions), the 40:20:40 second row of seats can slide fore and aft within a 178 mm range. \nIn the US, the 2018 Tiguan will be powered by an updated version of VW’s 2.0 litre TSI engine with 184 hp and 300 Nm of torque, driving the front wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. Optional 4Motion with Active Control all-wheel-drive offers four driver selectable modes. \nA reverse camera is standard, and Adaptive Cruise Control, upgraded for use in stop and go traffic; Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Monitoring; Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert; and Lane Departure Warning are all available. Also on the list is the class exclusive Automatic Post-Collision Braking System. \nThe SUV’s interior comes with rhombus pattern fabric seats in entry models. Available equipment include leather, an eight-way power driver’s seat, heated front seats and steering wheel, panoramic sunroof, foot-activated power liftgate, Digital Cockpit display (as seen in our B8 Passat ) and the Fender Premium Audio System. \nThe optional VW Car-Net system provides a suite of connected vehicle services, including standard App-Connect tech that offers compatible smartphone integration with the three major platforms – Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and MirrorLink. \nBy the way, the standard Tiguan (not this enlarged version) is set to be introduced in Malaysia this year as a locally-assembled (CKD) model – it was recently spotted in the East Coast .
