Ortega/Getty Images \nWelcome to the teen years! Kate Hudson shared a sweet message to her son Ryder on his 13th birthday on Instagram on Saturday, January 7. PHOTOS: Just Like Us: Celebrity Moms \n\"Thirteen years... Today I reflect on how lucky I am to have spent my entire adult years being Ryder's mother,\" the 37-year-old actress captioned a throwback picture of herself and her eldest son holding hands on the beach. \"My dear Ryd man! Today you are 13! Hard to believe but I'm staring right at you and my goodness yes you are a teenager!\" \n\"I couldn't be more in love with who you are as a person and who you are growing into as a young man,\" she continued. \"Smart, funny, joyful, tolerant, perceptive, empathetic, loving, you continue to maintain the beautiful attributes of your true nature and I will always be there as your touchstone to help nurture them or rediscover them if they ever get cloudy. But watching you independently keep these characteristics close and alive has been a wondrous journey in which I look forward to witnessing every waking hour. Happy Birthday baby!!! 13 is looking pretty awesome so far!!! I love you #RyderIsThirteen #HappyBirthday #ProudMama.\" A photo posted by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) on Jan 7, 2017 at 10:05am PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:15:45.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
