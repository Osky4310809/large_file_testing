The 41-year-old will fight Kelvin Gastelum at the June 3 pay-per-view in Brazil, UFC announced Tuesday. Silva, an MMA legend and former middleweight champion, last fought at UFC 208 in February. He defeated Derek Brunson via unanimous decision, but that bout was shrouded in controversy after many believed Brunson won the fight. Brunson was visibly upset afterward, going as far as to text UFC president Dana White about the situation. White also scored the fight in Brunson's favor but was unmoved by the difference of opinion. “It has nothing to do with me,\" White said, per Damon Martin of Fox Sports. \"He can text me and I can feel for him, but it has nothing to do with me. You have to beat your opponent and you have to beat the judges unfortunately. That’s the business.” Silva had lost four of his previous five fights, the fifth being a no-contest after the Brazilian tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. He served a year-long suspension before coming back and losing to Michael Bisping and Daniel Cormier. In a Facebook post Monday, Silva called out Nate Diaz and Bisping as the opponents he wanted to face next. \"We are three great professionals, what makes the most sense at the moment, is not his fight with any other, but with me, regardless of belt. Regardless of the show, we respect each other, a new fight between us, would be a great fight of gentlemen,\" the post read . Gastelum called out Silva at his post-fight press conference after defeating Vitor Belfort at UFC Fight Night 106. \"It’s a combination of a lot of things. (Silva) is a big name, he's another legend, and he’s ranked above me,” Gastelum told reporters . \"I want to keep moving up the rankings. I want a fight that will get me, that will eventually give me a title shot. If we wanna go and make it happen in June 3rd in Rio, I’d love for it to happen.” The 25-year-old is 14-2 and has won his last two bouts via knockout.
