The world governing body have merely stated that if the Reds were to play Matip without Cameroon’s permission then it could lead to disciplinary action being taken. \nA FIFA spokesman said: “We can confirm that Liverpool FC contacted FIFA about the matter and our services answered by directing the club to the applicable provisions. \n“A player who has been called up by his association for one of its representative teams is, unless otherwise agreed by the relevant association, not entitled to play for the club with which he is registered during the period for which he has been released or should have been released pursuant to the provisions of this annexe, plus an additional period of five days.” Matip claims he has retired from international duty (Photo: Matthew Lewis) Read More Liverpool to snub Newcastle interest in winger \nFIFA also stated that “any potential violation of the applicable provisions would need to be investigated by the FIFA disciplinary committee”. \nAsked if they would step in to resolve the row and when a decision was likely, the spokesman told the Liverpool Echo that “no further comment on the issue could be provided”. \nIf Cameroon were to reach the final of the Africa Cup of Nations on February 5 then Matip wouldn’t be available to play for Liverpool until February 10.
