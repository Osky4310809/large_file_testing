That does seem a little odd to hear considering the fact that Black Adam has done some seriously dark and shady sh*t in the comic books, right?\nOne of the movie's producers and the Vice President of The Rock’s production company, Seven Bucks Productions, was also there and he too has teased some big things to come for the DC Films Universe. Perhaps we're going to get some big casting news in the near future or even confirmation that Henry Cavill's Superman will somehow factor into Shazam . For now, we'll all just have to wait and see.\nWhat do you guys think about Johnson's comments about some \"fun\" and \"optimistic\" changes?\n Had a very cool and strategic meeting with the heads of DC about their entire universe. As a hard core DC fan, to get a real sense of the tonal shifts and developments coming in these future movies has me fired up. Something we, as DC fans have all been waiting for for a very long time. Hope, optimism & FUN. Even when talking about the the most ruthless villain/anti-hero of all time finally coming to life.
