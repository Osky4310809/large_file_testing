These sketches released by the carmaker show us a five-door SUV that exhibits a coupe-like design. \nThe electric concept features short overhangs, which is said to benefit interior space, and the lack of a traditional front grille, another highlight of its zero emissions nature. Dimension wise, the SUV measures 4,645 mm long, 1,917 mm wide, 1,550 mm tall, and has a wheelbase of 2,850 mm. \nPropulsion comes in the form of a pair of electric motors, one for each axle, which provides a total system output of 225 kW (302 hp). Skoda is quoting a top speed of 180 km/h, and a range of up to 500 km thanks to the SUV’s lithium-ion batteries and energy recuperation system. \nSkoda’s electrification of its model range will begin by as early as 2019, with the launch of a plug-in hybrid version of the Superb . This will be followed by its first battery electric vehicle in 2020, and by 2025, Skoda aims to have five electric vehicles in various segments. \nThat’s not all, as the Vision E is said to achieve the prerequisites for level 3 autonomous driving. This means it can drive independently in traffic jams, go into autopilot on motorways, stay in lane and swerve, carry out overtaking manoeuvres, independently search for free parking spaces and park and leave parking spaces on its own.
