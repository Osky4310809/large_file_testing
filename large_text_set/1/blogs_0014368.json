You’re a passionate lover, but are prone to some selfish and stubborn behavior. Your energy can be a little off-putting to people who first meet you. It’ll take someone special who can keep up.\nTaurus (April 20th to May 21st) You’re terrible at communicating. It’s like trying to talk to a rock. If you ever want a chance at real love, you’re going to have to start opening up.\nGemini (May 22nd to June 21st) You cannot decide who the hell you are and that’s very off-putting in a relationship, not to mention unsettling. The sooner you figure yourself out, the sooner you’ll have romantic success.\nCancer (June 22nd to July 22nd) Someone probably met a Cancer and that’s how the word sensitive was invented. Not to say that’s always bad, but you overreact to things that are honestly not a big deal. You spend more time crying over someone not texting you back quickly enough than you do actually going out on dates. Probably not super productive.\nLeo (July 23rd to August 22nd) People get tired of fluffing up your ego. It’s cute in the beginning, but needing so much praise from the person you’re dating will get old very quickly. You need to learn the difference between wanting to be appreciated and wanting to be complimented.\nVirgo (August 23rd to September 22nd) Because you’re so hard on yourself, you’ve learned to be hard on everyone else too. Being a perfectionist is not going to serve you well in love. Even when you meet someone you do like, you can’t seem to stop yourself from searching for their flaws. Having standards is a good thing. Having impossible standards is not.\nLibra (September 23rd to October 22nd) You’re so busy trying to make logical decisions all the time and it’s a total drag. Spice it up a little! Try some impulsivity every now and then. Love isn’t rational.\nScorpio (October 23rd to November 22nd) It’s probably because you tend to bite the heads off any potential mate. Figuratively or literally, take your pick.\nSagittarius (November 23rd to December 21st) You have some serious commitment issues. People fall for you quite easily, actually, but you’re not looking to be tied down anytime soon.\nCapricorn (December 22nd to January 20th) You are so, so, so boring. I almost forgot to include you.\nAquarius (January 21st to February 18th) It takes you so long to figure out what you’re feeling that by the time you decide you’re interested in someone, they’ve moved on. People aren’t going to wait around forever.\nPisces (February 19th to March 20th) For such a self-proclaimed romantic, you seriously S-U-C-K at love. You spend so much time in a dream world that when real life doesn’t mimic your greatest fantasies, you end up gravely disappointed. Stop orchestrating the perfect meet-cute and give actual dating (including the messy, unexciting moments) a shot. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:01:17.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
