Roberts just offered Sen. Wyden a valium at the Steven Mnuchin hearing Posted at 10:59   Greg P.   \nThe next four years are going to be awesome if this is going to happen all the time. \nRepublican Sen. Pat Roberts just offered a valium to Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden before his next round of questions for Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin: Sen. Roberts during Treasury confirmation hearing offers Valium to fellow senator, says he's said it to POTUS, after criticism. Getting ugly \n— Nicole Rodriguez (@NicRodriguez) January 19, 2017 Sen. Roberts just told Sen. Wyden to take a valium and now the Senate Finance Committee is arguing over the horribly delivered joke \n— Kira Lerner (@kira_lerner) January 19, 2017 . @SenPatRoberts says @RonWyden should take a valium? Maybe more Senators should be outraged by Wall St bankers that steal people's homes. \n— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) January 19, 2017 \nSen. Roberts then defended the joke: \"A little pinprick of humor might not hurt this committee once in a while\" to a prickly @RonWyden over a Valium joke", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T18:31:39.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
