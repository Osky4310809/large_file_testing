DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY InMind VR and InCell VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY InMind VR is one of the most popular VR games to date.

DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Need for Jump VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Need for Jump is a colorful little platformer where you must run around and collect coins. The game uses the player’s head movements in order to determine direction. You look left and right to move in those directions and then nod your head in order to jump. It’s also another one of the few VR games that allows for multiplayer. It’s not the most complex game out there, but it’s a good little time killer. The game is free to download and play which makes it easy on the wallet as well!

The developer has another VR game called V Vanguard which isn't half bad either. They're a bit old, but both should be decent VR games! DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Trinus VR Price: Free / $9.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY TrinusVR isn’t a VR game on the face of it, but it does let you play VR games. The general idea is that you can use this to play PC games. Here’s how it works.

The game is then streamed to your headset which emulates a VR experience. This gives a pseudo-VR experience that is actually fairly unique. Things can be a bit jumpy when you’re actually using it, so be sure to use the free demo first to make sure your system and device can handle it!
