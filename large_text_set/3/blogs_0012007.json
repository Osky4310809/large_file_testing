While there is the possibility North Korea is simply taking extra safety precautions, the North could also be preparing to test a 282-kiloton nuclear bomb. \nNorth Korea’s last nuclear test had an explosive yield of only 20-30 kilotons. \n“The nuclear test which the North is trying to conduct at the Punggye-ri test site will break the country into two pieces,” Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected last year, explained to Voice of America. \nHe said that the radiation from a massive nuclear test would bring about an “apocalypse.” \nThae also suggested that the possible destruction from such a test could topple the current regime by cutting Pyongyang’s connections to the outer regions, thus weakening the regime’s control over them. \n“All northward roads and railways pass by Punggye-ri. If a massive explosion pollutes the area, and subsequently Pyongyang loses its control over the border areas of North Hamkyong Province, a massive defection will take place there,” Thae remarked, noting that a failed test could bring down Kim Jong-un and his reign of terror. \nThae Yong-ho explained that North Korea “will never give up nuclear weapons” and is likely to experiment with bigger tests; however, he argues that North Korea is too small for such tests. \nNorth Korea announced Monday that it is unwilling to even discuss the possibility of de-nuclearization. \n“If the purpose is making us give up our nuclear program, North Korea is not interested in any kind of dialogue,” Ambassador Kim In-ryong, North Korea’s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:26:58.107+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
