Photo: Owen Buggy Photography and Rob Sorrenti \nThe vessel is known as the Kodiak Queen (or YO-44) and will be submerged off the coast of Virgin Gorda. Although it may seem counterintuitive to sink a boat that remains one of the few survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor, submerging the boat will actually save it from becoming scrap metal. \nThe boat is expected to be submerged this month. One or two months after it is sunk, divers will be able to explore the area. \nOnboard the sunken boat, divers will be able to explore a sunken art installation. The crowning gem of the collection will be a giant Kraken sculpture that will wrap its arms around the boat. Once the Kraken and other art is installed, the team behind the project will monitor the underwater reef and artificial habitat to monitor the marine health of the area.

Artist / Creative Director: Aydika James \n“This project provides an exciting opportunity to capture people’s attention and then to refocus it on important issues facing our oceans,” Branson wrote to the New York Times in an email , “for example, the importance of addressing global warming to protect our coral reefs and the need to rehabilitate vulnerable marine species such as severely overfished grouper populations.” \nBranson is working in conjunction with several organizations to produce the diving site—including Unite BVI, a not-for-profit that empowers local children, Secret Samurai Productions, a group of artists who produce “engagement art,” and Maverick 1000, a collective of entrepreneurs who fund innovative new ideas.
