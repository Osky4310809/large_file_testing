Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTony Bellew silenced David Haye on a thrilling night at the O2 Arena with an 11th-round stoppage of his bitter rival. \nBut the Hayemaker emerged from the battle with immense credit after suffering a suspected snapped Achilles tendon midway through the fight and battling on bravely for five more rounds. \nBellew finally ended the contest with a right hand which put Haye through the ropes 2minutes 16seconds into the penultimate round. \nAnd even though Haye jumped back into the ring before referee Phil Edwards had counted to 10, his trainer Shane McGuigan threw in the towel. Haye's knee went in the sixth round (Photo: REUTERS) \nBellew climbed on to the ropes to take the acclaim — and he deserved all the applause that rained down on him for the way he has conducted himself in the build-up to the fight and the contest itself. \nHaye’s injury might have detracted from the quality of the bout but it made for an entertaining battle. \nHe now faces a real hard road to get his career back on track, if he can fix the Achilles which was reportedly causing him problems in the build-up to the fight. \nCertainly, Anthony Joshua, who was ringside, will not have seen anything to trouble him from Haye, who was desperately hoping a convincing win in this fight would set him up for a clash with the IBF champ. \nNot even before his right leg was effectively made redundant. The pair locked horns at the O2 in front of a sell out crowd (Photo: REUTERS) \nHaye was on top but a slip caused his Achilles to give way and Bellew took full advantage. \nHe will now go back to the cruiserweight division on cloud nine and believing he can achieve his dream of unifying the titles. \nHis game plan, obviously helped by Haye’s injury, was perfect in the end — he stayed at a safe distance and then pounced when opportunity knocked. \nThe O2 was at its 20,000 capacity — Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney, pop star Lily Allen and tennis legend Boris Becker, as well as a plethora of boxers among that number — and absolutely pumping as the two men made their way to the ring. The bout came after months of trash talk (Photo: Getty) \nBellew looked relaxed as he made his way out to the theme from Z Cars, the music which greets his beloved Everton at Goodison Park. \nHaye, too, as he emerged to Ain’t No Stopping Us Now and made his way to the ring with the swagger of a man who was certain things would go his way. \nWhatever you have made of the verbal battle which proceeded last night’s contest — and there are many who felt Haye has taken it too far — the two men have generated all the interest they hoped to. \nBellew didn't push it to anything like the levels Haye did but, make no mistake, he’s no shrinking violet himself. Haye stood up to Bellew's punching (Photo: Getty) \nOnly the two of them will know if they really meant what they said — maybe they did. \nThe one thing that is certain is that it helped swell their coffers big time. \nHaye raked in at least £4million and Bellew at least £2.5m, not bad for a fight which was billed as a heavyweight contest but never was. \nNot many people gave Bellew a chance — not even a puncher’s one — before the fight. \nHaye has knocked down much bigger men than Bellew in the past and the moment he connected with one of those Hayemaker’s his opponent was always going to be in trouble. Haye lands a left (Photo: REUTERS) \nBellew’s trainer, Dave Coldwell, repeatedly told his fighter to focus in the seconds before the first bell. \nCredit to Bellew in what was a tense first round, he countered strongly and caught Haye with four clean shots to the head. \nHaye found his way through once and found his range much better in round two. \nClearly, he was looking for the big punch that would end this fight quickly but Bellew fought at a sensible distance. \nBellew’s plan was clearly to take the fight into the later rounds and hope Haye tired but Haye landed cleanly with heavy right-left combination. \nBellew took it well but he knew well enough not to expose himself to too many of those shots, and when Haye slipped he took full advantage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:12:24.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
