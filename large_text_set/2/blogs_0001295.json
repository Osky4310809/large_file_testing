Saigon had just fallen, and there was an explosion of refugees fleeing a violent regime in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. My father, who had served in the U.S. Marine Corps in Vietnam, and my mother made a decision that our family would offer shelter, opportunity and a second chance to those who were fleeing.\nSoon thereafter, my family met Phuong and Dang, and welcomed them into our home.\n Phuong’s journey to our Orlando home was remarkable, as he escaped Saigon by making a split-second decision to cling to the rails of a departing helicopter that eventually crashed into the South China Sea. It was there that he was introduced to the generosity of Americans as he was plucked from the waters and rescued by a U.S. Navy carrier.\nPhuong was placed in a transitional refugee camp in California where he met Dang, and eventually the two were transferred to Orlando. Upon arrival in Florida, Phuong and Dang spoke no English and owned little more than the clothes on their backs. I can only imagine how frightened these young men must have been as they entered America.\nWhile Dang moved on quickly, Phuong became family. His current relationship with my mother is that of a son, and my Christmas memories are filled with my Vietnamese brother entrenched in all of our family traditions.\nEventually, Phuong moved from our house into a local apartment. He learned to speak English at Webster Vocational School and received the credentials necessary to attend Valencia Community College. Phuong then attended the University of Florida, where he became an electrical engineer and proceeded to serve as an engineer in the U.S. Air Force in Warner Robbins, Ga., for more than 30 years. He gave back to the country that gave him the chance to live the American dream.\nOur new president made international news this past week as he challenged that American dream by ordering a temporary ban on refugees and a block on citizen travel from a number of predominantly Muslim countries. In addition, he dramatically cut the number of refugees that would be allowed to resettle in the U.S. in 2017.\nThe refugees most impacted are from Syria, a country facing the worst humanitarian refugee crisis since World War II. These people are not perpetrators of terror; they are victims of it, no different from Phuong and Dang who escaped the Communist regime in 1975. Men, women and children are running for their lives. Syrians are fleeing a brutal dictator who has used chemical weapons on his own people and an extremist movement that is enslaving, raping and murdering people throughout the Middle East.\nThe refugees are not fleeing by choice but as an act of survival. Our president just shut the proverbial door in the face of those fleeing terror, but he is not alone. In November 2015, Gov. Rick Scott announced his opposition to all state and federal efforts to resettle Syrian refugees in Florida. This anti-refugee argument is supported by our governor and now our president. They argue the vetting process is flawed — a process that now takes 18 months to two years, and is dissimilar and vastly more stringent than the often-criticized European procedures. The governor and president argue it is for our safety. Since 1980, when American refugee acceptance procedures were established, not a single refugee has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in this country.\nThis presidential executive order is not at all presidential. It is not well thought out, and it has been poorly executed. It will make us less safe and less respected around the world. As I consider the refugee families who will never visit the Sunshine State or have a chance to bring their entrepreneurial ambitions or family’s hopes and dreams to Florida, I am saddened.\nPhuong was allowed his opportunity at the American dream because of a decision made by a generous, confident, brave nation, 41 years ago. He took that opportunity and ran with it.\n He married and now has a son named Christopher, who just graduated from Georgia Tech with the highest honors, summa cum laude.\n America has been a gift to Phuong, but more important, Phuong has been a gift to my family and to our nation. We simply would not be whole without him.\nA young Chris King holds Phuong's son, Chris. Chris King A young Chris King holds Phuong's son, Chris. A young Chris King holds Phuong's son, Chris.
