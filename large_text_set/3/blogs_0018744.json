Mr Christensen was met with a barrage of abuse when he questioned the driver (Lee Christensen) \n“He said I was just looking at my sat nav, it doesn’t matter, what difference does it make for you. \n\"He started swearing a bit. \n“He told me that he’d knock me off my bike.” \nMr Christensen, who cycles to work in central London, said he often comes across drivers using mobiles phones, but added he can find it difficult to reason with them. \nHe said: “There’s no point arguing or making a reasoned argument with them, I don’t often stop and chat to drivers that do things like that, there is almost no point. The cyclist had earlier seen the driver appearing to use his phone (Lee Christensen) \n“They just get abusive to you or shrug it off like they don’t know what’s going on. \n“It is always the drivers that are behaving badly anyway that get aggressive. \n“He’s just lucky I wasn’t a police officer.” \nHe added that he’d reported the incident, which happened on March 8 at 5.45pm, to police via an online Roadsafe form.
