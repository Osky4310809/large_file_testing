In 2017, the company wants to begin operating with profit as a goal and seriously putting Sailfish OS up against Android and iOS, especially in China and South America. Plus, we're starting to see the fruits of the labor that has been, up until now, a mysterious partnership with Sony Mobile. Is there a real alternative to Android? \nIn some countries, Jolla wasn't very well known and it didn't have much success. But that's not important now. In its native Finland, it's developing the software part of the project. The long-term partnership they presented under the title 'Sailfish China Consortiums', with a five-year plan, should guarantee the company’s funding. Jolla is currently selling a software platform that, at first glance, is very similar to Android. Their plan is to take advantage of the mistrust that has begun surging around Google and Apple. Both Android and iOS operating systems may be safe , but they give developers little (or no) ability to influence it. They also don't provide any insight into what is happening on the deeper levels of the system or what data they send to their centers. Opinion by Eric Herrmann iOS and Android aren't as transparent as they could be What do you think? 50 34 participants \nJolla claims to provide the first operating system that is regionally restricted. In other words: all data remains in the country of the buyer. However, Jolla’s clients, that is to say, device manufacturers that want to use Sailfish OS, must give back their changes to the OS kernel. It's an Open Source project where apps used on Russian Sailfish devices should also work on Brazilian Sailfish devices.

OMP partners, who were also present, would have suggested this limitation like Pienimäki has done in passing. It's still not clear if Sailfish OS can contribute anything worthwhile to the smartphone ecosystem. Examples, such as removal of APK support in Russia, show us that Jolla still hasn't chosen a position. Sailfish devices are still neutral and their ecosystem is far from being finished. This is also made evident by the lack of interoperability between devices.

We'll have to see if this problem can be left in the hands of a third-party company. If this new approach does work, though, Sailfish might be able to break up the current duopoly. \nDo you think Sailfish could compete with Android? Would you ever try an alternative to iOS or Android?
