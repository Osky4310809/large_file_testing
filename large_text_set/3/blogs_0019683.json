The Mountain View giant dropped the preview for the next version of Android dubbed Android O out of the blue, and while we don’t know what ‘O’ stands for yet (fingers crossed for Oreo), we do have a pretty good grasp of the new features which will come bundled with the developer build. Although Android O is still a long way away and most of the enhancements which Google showcased in the preview are relatively minor and work behind the scenes, we decided to round up the best of the bunch and here are the Android O features you need to look out for. Improved battery life \nGoogle has been putting great emphasis on improving the battery life of our smartphones and the last few updates are a testament to that. With Android Marshmallow, Google introduced the Doze mode which limits the smartphone’s performance by putting it in a low-power state when the device isn’t in use. Android O hopes to improve on that by limiting which resources idle apps can use in the background, thereby reducing power consumption. This should also bump up the performance of a smartphone as the CPU won’t be bogged down by various location updates, broadcasts and other app services that usually work in the background. Cleaner notifications \nWith Android O, Google is giving users the ability to group certain notifications from apps under ‘channels’, thereby reducing clutter on the status bar. Developers will also be able to program notifications based on various priority levels ranging from 0 to 5, with 3 being the default setting which will vibrate the phone and display a notification everywhere, but won’t be visually intrusive. All the notifications within a channel will behave the same and users will be able to modify these behaviours through the settings menu or by long-tapping on the notification channel. Picture-in-Picture mode \nUsers who watch a lot of YouTube videos on their smartphones will be familiar with this feature. With Android O, Google is providing a native support for PIP mode, which will allow users to minimise a video and browse elsewhere or open a different app with the video overlaid. While the minimised screen would be too small to enjoy any video, it is still better than having to close the video and opening it again each time you need to do something else on your smartphone. Adaptive icons \nAs we mentioned earlier, most of the enhancements which come with Android O will work behind the scenes. However, Google will introduce some new design elements with Android O, including Adaptive icons. These will allow developers to change the shape of their app icons to better suit a smartphone’s custom UI. This will keep a user’s home screen more uniform irrespective of whether it’s a Samsung device or an LG one. Additionally, Android O will also bring the ability to animate icons when they are interacted with. Better quality wireless audio \nWith the recent trend of axing the headphone jack on phones slowly catching on, it’s safe to assume that the future of audio will be wireless. However, the audio quality offered by a wired connection is still superior as compared to the one offered by a Bluetooth headset, which is where Google hopes to improve on with Android O. Google has partnered with Sony to bring the Japanese brand’s proprietary LDAC encoding system to Android O. For the uninitiated, LDAC offers a much higher bitrate transmission over a standard Bluetooth connection, offering up to three times more (990kbps) data transferred than the current technology (330kbps). This requires compatible hardware which only Sony’s headsets and speakers offer right now. However, seeing how the LDAC will come integrated with Android O, more brands will be able to wirelessly transmit higher bitrates of data which will lead to more audio manufacturers making LDAC-compatible headphones. Wide colour gamut support \nScreens on modern-day smartphones pack more pixels than most TVs and laptops, and with Android O, they’ll get even better. Google has added support for Wide Gamut displays, which will now exhibit a richer range of colours on WCG compatible screens. While these are the most notable additions which are worth getting excited for, there are many other enhancements which Google is working on with Android O, such as improved keyboard navigation, WebView enhancements and so on. There will be a total of four developer previews and the final software is expected to hit smartphones this fall. Needless to add, we’d be waiting for that with bated breath to see how the next big refresh of the Android platform improves our smartphone usage experience.
