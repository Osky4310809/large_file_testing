In terms of upcoming projects, few are more worrying than The Flash , which has gone through multiple directors and doesn’t even have a potential release date.\nNow it’s reported the script is getting a page-one rewrite, meaning that it’s getting almost entirely redone.\nJoby Harold, whose resume only has a few big-budget credits, including the upcoming Guy Ritchie, flick King Arthur: Legend of the Sword , has been tasked with doing the rewrite.\nAdditionally, the film has already gone through two directors: Seth Grahame-Smith–most known for writing Pride and Prejudice and Zombies –and Rick Famuyiwa, who directed the 2015 indie hit Dope . Famuyiwa left the project in October over creative differences .\nBoth the directors did drafts. Grahame-Smith wrote the original script and was attached to make his directorial debut with The Flash before departing, and Famuyiwa did a rewrite when he was brought on. He said he was excited to work on the project and bring his “voice, humor, and heart” to it. However, it’s been said Warner Bros. didn’t like the script or story, which supposedly had more edge.\nWarner Bros. executives are working on the new script while Ezra Miller, who’s going to star as Barry Allen, films Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2 . They’re taking their time finding a replacement director.\nThe only thing that has been consistent about The Flash has been the actors. Miller, who made cameos in Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , is set to star as the scarlet speedster in Justice League . Famuyiwa brought on Kiersey Clemons to play Iris West and Billy Crudup to play Barry’s father, and those two actors are still attached.\nThere was also the rumor Flash was going to be facing off against the Rogues , but with Famuyiwa gone, this’ll probably change.\nThis isn’t the first time Warner Bros. has looked like they don’t know what they’re doing in regards to the DCEU. Both Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad were grim messes with terrible scripts (or at least according to the ones we saw on the screen). The studio is jumping ahead with a ton of new additions to the universe–including Harley Quinn spin-off Gotham City Sirens –before getting a handle on what their franchise will look like. Seeing the studio scramble with The Flash doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence that it’s learned from its mistakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T07:22:17.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
