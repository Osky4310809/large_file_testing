The update isn’t just an OS change, though. It brings so much more, including a bunch of stuff scheduled to be a part of the new SHIELD’s launch, like Amazon Video.\nWith the update to Android 7.0 Nougat, NVIDIA is including picture-in-picture support, a new settings menu, and an option I needed a year ago – recent apps page. Other related enhancements include a pause/play button by double tapping the volume slider, ability to write to an attached USB or SD card, a cast option for HBO GO, and support for 4.1, 6.1, and 8.1 Plex speaker configurations. <span id=\"more-195811\"></span>\nAs for other huge news, the update brings with it Amazon Video. That means Prime members and other Amazon fans can now stream Amazon’s catalog of movies and shoes, like <em>The Grand Tour</em>, in 4K HDR. NVIDIA is simplifying their layout, as well, by including an NVIDIA Games App, where users will find GeForce NOW games, “exclusive” Android games, and GameStream titles. This app replaces the SHIELD Hub.\nThe update also adds a performance upgrade to GeForce NOW (cloud systems now feature up to a GeForce GTX 1080), GameStream in 4K HDR, and the ability to watch live Nest Cam video. Additionally, a bundle of new apps is loaded (NFL, Twitter, Comedy Central, and Vimeo), plus a whole bunch of new games are available (pictured below).\n life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.15-PM.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-195814\" src=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.15-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1084\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.15-PM.jpg 1566w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.15-PM-438x268.jpg 438w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.15-PM-980x600.jpg 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px\" /></a>\n life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.55-PM.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-195812\" src=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.55-PM-438x248.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"431\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.55-PM-438x248.jpg 438w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.55-PM-980x556.jpg 980w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.55-PM.jpg 1513w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" /></a>  life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.32-PM.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-195813\" src=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.32-PM-438x243.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.32-PM-438x243.jpg 438w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.32-PM-980x545.jpg 980w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-15-at-8.44.32-PM.jpg 1522w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" /></a>\nThe update should be rolling out as early as tonight, so be sure to check.
