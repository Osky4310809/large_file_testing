Detroit’s Big Sean has been having a pretty good lately. He’s locked down Jhene Aiko and released his best work yet , I Decided. , and isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. His latest endeavor doesn’t have to do with music; instead he’s working with his mother, Myra Anderson, on a new initiative called Mogul Prep. Launching through Big Sean’s Sean Anderson Foundation, Mogul Prep is an education and career development program that is aimed at making education fun for students by incorporating different professional aspects of the music industry. The two hope that by giving students a better real-life picture of how their school skills can be used, they’ll be more engaged in learning. “We’re using the music industry as a hook,” explained Myra Anderson to Billboard in an interview. “Basically, what we did was introduce some jobs to these kids in different ways in the music industry and you can be involved,” Sean explained about how the program works. “It’s me on the stage, but there’s about 30 other people who are working for me to be on that stage. You have the lighting guy, the production manager, the tour manager, the sound guys, the monitor guys — the kids need to know that.” Big Sean will head out on a five-city tour starting April 1 to promote the Mogul Prep initiative and encourage kids to take an interest in professions within the entertainment field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:26:11.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
