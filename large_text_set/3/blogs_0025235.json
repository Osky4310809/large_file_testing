The second best Persian food you can eat in the U.S. is probably in  Los Angeles : California's biggest city is sometimes referred to as Tehrangeles because it's home to the largest population of Iranians — and Iranian restaurants — outside of Iran. Barring both of those options, here are a few restaurants in the New York City area where traditional Persian food is served daily. There are a few things to know about this ancient cuisine if you've never had it:\nIt's meaty: Kebabs and meat-based stews are always among the main courses, though almost all of these places offer one or two stews without meat for vegetarian diners.\nThe portions are very generous: At most Persian restaurants in the U.S. expect to walk out with leftovers.\nThe flavors are delicate: As with other Middle Eastern cuisines, Persian cooks like to mix the sweet with the savory. One of the most popular stews, fesenjan, involves a blend of sweet-tart pomegranates and crushed walnuts. Persian dishes almost never contain garlic or hot spices; onions, yogurt, and fresh herbs are used liberally.\nFinally, finish your meal as Iranians do: with a cup of tea. Persian black tea is a wonderful digestive and pairs very well with baklava or a similarly sweet dessert.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:53:26.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
