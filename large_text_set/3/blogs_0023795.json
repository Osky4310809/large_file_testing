Joining the Z900 ABS is the 2017 Kawasaki Z900 ABS Special Edition, which goes for RM50,959 , including GST. \nAs the replacement for the Kawasaki Z800, the Z900 ABS is an all-new machine, which shares little with its predecessor except for general styling. The Z900 carries a 948 cc liquid-cooled, inline-four engine that puts out 124 hp at 9,500 rpm 98.6 Nm of torque at 7,700 rpm – 13 more hp than the Z800. \nAdding to the improvements made to the previous generation Z800, the Z900 now comes standard with a slipper clutch that stops wheel hop and chatter during hard downshifts. The instrument panel is now an LCD screen that shows the three ride modes, along with a shift-light incorporated into the tachometer. \nThe base model of the Z900 comes in Grey, while the Special Edition is available in Blue. The Special Edition Z900 ABS comes equipped with a single seat cover, meter cover, DC outlet, radiator screen, sliders, engine covers, front-axle sliders and special graphics. \nAlso included in the special edition version are OEM Kawasaki tank pad and knee pads. The 2017 Kawasaki Z900 ABS will be available at GT World Ninja, Ninja Shops and Kawasaki authorised premium dealers on April 8.
