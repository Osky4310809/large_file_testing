Doug Ducey just doesn’t much like children. \nOh, not all children, of course. He loves the unborn ones, hopping to it whenever Cathi Herrod calls with yet another bill aimed at making it as miserable as possible for women who have made the gut wrenching decision to end a pregnancy. \nCertainly, he cares for and appreciates middle- and upper-class children. I’m quite sure that, should it reach his desk, Ducey will sign this year’s voucher bill – allowing more and more suburban students to put public money toward private school tuition while inner-city kids are stuck in underfunded public schools. In fact, he’ll likely hold a signing ceremony to celebrate. \nNo, it’s the poor kids he doesn’t much seem to like. I get it. They become a burden on us all when their parents are, for whatever reason, unable to properly take care of them. \nInstead of trying to help them, though, it seems we, as a state are determined to penalize them. The kids, that is. \nI had high hopes when Ducey in January announced that he wanted to return to expand the federal Temporary Aid for Needy Families program in Arizona two years. This, after imposing the nation’s toughest one-year cap during his first year in office. \n\"For Arizonans who are actively looking for a job, who are getting their kids to school — let’s extend them up to 12 additional months of cash assistance,\" Ducey said in his State of the State address. \nI thought he was putting the good of the state above the good of his resume for higher office. Refreshing, I know. \nIt took a few months for the strings to show up. \nThe Republic’s Mary Jo Pitzl reports that Ducey’s plan would likely block 30 percent of qualified needy families from getting that second year of help. \nTANF requires that parents do certain entirely reasonable things, like looking for a job and making sure their kids are immunized and in school. \nCurrently, parents get three strikes before they’re dropped from the program. \nUnder Ducey’s plan, if parents made so much as one mistake during the first year of receiving benefits, they’d be ineligible for a second year of help. If they make it to the second year, they’d be dropped after two mistakes. \nAgain, I get it. It’s difficult to help parents who can’t or won’t help themselves. \nBut here are a couple of things to remember. This isn’t a program in which people can suck up public benefits for much of their lives. That cap – one year in Arizona, two or more in other states – is for a lifetime. \nAnd you’re not likely to find people getting TANF benefits and driving a Cadillac. This is for the poorest of the poor. A family of four has to earn less than $5,022 a year to qualify for a benefit that averages $270 a month. \nOf the 18,851 people on the program, 80 percent are kids, according to state records. \nWhen Ducey imposed a one-year cap in 2015, 2,700 children were hurt . This, so that we could save $4 million. \nTeam Ducey notes that under his restoration plan -- House Bill 2372 -- 70 percent of families would qualify for a second year of cash assistance. They point out that parents who are serious about following the rules get time to correct any mistake before getting cut off. \n\"We are going to treat those who are complying better than those who aren't,\" Christina Corieri, a senior policy adviser to Ducey, told Pitzl. \nOn paper, it makes sense. The rules are set up to help parents find work so that they can support themselves and their families. \nOutside of government hallways, however, it seems heartless. Oh, not for the parents who didn’t follow the rules. It's the kids I worry about. \nBy my calculation, 5,203 children would be cut off from help they badly need under Ducey’s proposal. This, because their parents screwed up. \nI wonder, who among us would be willing to face these children and take away what little they have, leaving them just a little hungrier, just a little poorer?
