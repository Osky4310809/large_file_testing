Somebody else has to want to do it and make it happen, but I certainly try to let the involved parties know, ‘if anybody’s interested, hi!’ I would absolutely do it.” Also Read: Hilary Duff Is Down for More 'Lizzie McGuire': 'Why Not?' \nMinsky also already has a pretty good idea of what Lizzie McGuire would be up to in 2017, having recently worked on an episode of Duff’s TV Land comedy “Younger.” \n“She still looks like Lizzie McGuire to me in this role,” Minskey said. “The fact that she is this cool, fashionable, intelligent executive, it all makes sense to me, and the only thing missing is the little animated character telling us what’s really going on inside her head.” \nDuff, for her part, said she would be down for more “Lizzie” as well, when asked in 2014. \nMinsky is preparing to debut a brand new Disney Channel comedy, “Andi Mack,” which premieres April 7. 13 TV Reboots That Should Have Been Booted (Photos) \n\"Charlie's Angels\" \"Charlie's Angels\" perfectly captured the goofiness of the '70s, but it felt painfully out of date in 2011. Critics and audiences agreed: It was canceled after three episodes. \n\"Ironside\" Blair Underwood has done some memorable TV work, starting with his career-making role on \"L.A. Law.\" But his 2013 take on the Raymond Burr crime drama was yanked from NBC's air even faster than you can say \"LAX\" or \"The Event.\" \n\"The Bionic Woman\" A 2007 take on the \"Six Million Dollar Man\" spinoff, this NBC show's original sin was casting \"Battlestar Galactica\" ass-kicker Katee Sackhoff as the recurring villain rather than the lead. \n\"Knight Rider\" Like so much '80s television, the original \"Knight Rider\" is over-celebrated. But NBC's 2008 version lacked even the original's dumb charms — and David Hasselhoff . \n\"The Returned\" SundanceTV had an international hit on its hands with the French-language moody zombie thriller. An English adaptation was of course inevitable, but Damon Lindelof 's A&E remake never quite found its audience, despite gaining the support of critics. Luckily, the original French series is still ongoing. \n\"Melrose Place\" The classic nighttime soap got a CW makeover in 2009, but the brand wasn't enough to keep an audience interested, especially on a network that was doing rich young people drama better on shows like \"Gossip Girl\" and even \"90210.\" \n\"Gracepoint\" Broadchurch captivated U.K. audiences with its tense murder mystery format, but when the U.S. tried to replicate its magic - with original star David Tennant in tow - it just never quite managed. Needless to say, Broadchurch is producing a third season, and Gracepoint was canceled after just one. \n\"Mockingbird Lane\" Bryan Fuller tried to put his stamp on a reboot of The Munsters, and it's still a bit of a cult classic among his fervent fans, but NBC never ordered the show to series. But at least we will always have the pilot, which aired in 2012, which is more than you can say for most pilots that don't get picked up to series. \n\"The IT Crowd\" This hilarious British series that helped launch Chris O'Dowd 's career ran for four seasons. It's American counterpart, not so much. The across the pond adaptation with Joel McHale was ordered to pilot but failed to get picked up at NBC. \n\"Dragnet\" Jack Webb and Ben Alexander starred in the original 1950's police procedural that became a major hit. Unfortunately, the Ed O'Neill and Ethan Embry reboot in 2003 failed to find similar success. It was cancelled after two seasons. \n\"Kojak\" Another police procedural bound to be rebooted, Telly Savalas starred as the chrome-domed detective in the 1970's series. Ving Rhames took the reins in 2005, but only made it nine episodes. \n\"The Muppets\" ABC's reboot of \"The Muppets\" was one of the most highly anticipated new shows of the 2015-16 TV season, but the inside look at the adult lives of Kermit and company failed to resonate with fans. \n\"Heroes Reborn\" Beyond \"Chuck\" star Zachary Levi , NBC's bland \"event series\" reboot of 2006's \"Heroes\" brought nothing new or interesting to the table.
