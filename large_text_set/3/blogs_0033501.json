(PTI image) \nUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday sent out a strong message to Pakistan even as he warned the ‘stone-pelters’ in Kashmir not to “get influenced by forces” from the neighbouring country. “New trend to pelt stones on security forces during anti-terror ops, I appeal to them to not get influenced by Pak forces,” Singh said in Lok Sabha. He also said that Pakistani groups have been using social media to galvanize crowds. “We will deal with terrorism the way it should be dealt with. Our security forces have be countering it and they will continue to do so,” Singh said. Meanwhile, IG of CRPF R Sahi said, “Neighbouring country sponsoring terrorism.”“Local youth being motivated to join. Working in coordination with other security forces,” he said. \nEarlier, Singh had said a new road-map is afoot to strengthen the border security and seal firmly the International Border with Bangladesh and Pakistan. \nWatch this video \n“The Centre has chalked out a new roadmap to strengthen the border security and plans to seal the International Borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan,” Singh said, addressing the Passing Out Parade of the BSF assistant commandants at the BSF Academy at Tekanpur near here. \nThe parade also saw the first woman assistant commandant of India’s border guarding force, Tanushree Pareek, passing out with Home Minister Singh registering his praise for the BSF’s first woman field officer. \nAn official release here quoted the Union Home Minister Singh as saying that the BSF had changed the rules of engagement on the International Border and now it was a “known force” even in the neighbouring countries. \nThe BSF built 73 Border Out Posts (BOPs) recently, and three more will be added soon, he added. \n“We are also planning an effective grievance redressal mechanism in the forces,” the Home Minister said. \nThe Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) were setting up such a mechanism, the release added. \nBSF was the only force after the Indian Army to operate on land, water and air, he said. \nIt is not only the “first line of defence” but also the “first wall of defence,” he added. \n“Display courage in the face of professional challenges, (show) compassion to the troops under command and (observe) integrity of highest order,” Singh said while addressing the passing out Assistant Commandants, according to the release. \n(With agency inputs)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T13:44:03.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
