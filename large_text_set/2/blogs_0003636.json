However, a ghost stuck in the tree (Anushka Sharma) starts to haunt (we use this term loosely) him, claiming he is now married to her. Anushka Sharma in the Phillauri trailer. \nAnushka looks ethereal as the ghost, even as the VFX (which makes her float and gives her a halo effect) reminds you of Amitabh Bachchan in Bhoothnath. She's a friendly spirit, who then follows around Suraj's character all around his house. This creates quite some tension as he is due to get married in a couple of days. \nHowever, the tone of the film changes completely when someone asks Shashi, the friendly ghost, if she has any remaining desire, because of which she is lurking around. We then go into a flashback, many centuries ago, in Punjab. \nIt's a fascinating world, quite different from the colourful, contemporary setting that the trailer starts with. \nIn it, Shashi tells her lover (Diljit Dosanj, looking quite dashing) who is a singer, that he has the power to change the world with his voice. He vows to come back to her only after he has made a name for himself. They both look quite in love, and we are shown how much goes wrong once he leaves. \nThe film then sets out to show you how the two worlds merge, via one spirit. A quirky and entertaining trailer, Phillauri looks and feels a lot like Love Aaj Kal , what with the sepia tones that are used to depict old-world Punjab. Anushka is the holding ground of the trailer, while there is much intrigue about Diljit Dosanjh. \nPhillauri releases on 24 March. Anushka had shown the trailer to members of the film industry over the weekend, and they had all tweeted lovely things about it. In a one of a kind marketing ploy, Anushka released the trailer while on a live Facebook chat. \nWatch the trailer here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:33:41.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
