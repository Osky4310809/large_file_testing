A long queue for expensive and unavailable kerosine \nHe also said the firm would soon commence massive production of Aviation Turbine Kero, ATK, for the aviation sector, saying: “We are refining kerosene, it is the first thing that comes out of the refinery but I cannot explain why the high cost of the product. I think the price is as a result of market forces.” \nAccording to him, the company was operating at a minimum of 60 percent, expressing hope that it would soon operate at an optimum capacity of 100.5 percent. \nHe said in December last year PHRC generated about N2.95 billion from production, saying it was already working to hit N1.3 trillion. \nDr Enjugu lamented that security and equipment were part of major impediments to production in the company, stressing that efforts were ongoing to overcome them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:02:08.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
