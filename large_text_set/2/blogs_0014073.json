AP \n  A school field trip turned into a horrific tragedy yesterday morning in Tanay, Rizal, with at least 15 people killed and 40 college students injured. \nAt least 14 college students and the bus driver died when their tourist bus smashed into an electric post along a curved road in Barangay Sampaloc in Tanay. \nSenior Supt. Randy Peralta, Rizal police director, said the students were on board a Panda Coach bus with plate number TXS 325. They left Bestlink College of the Philippines in Novaliches, Quezon City at 6:30 a.m. and were on their way to Sacramento Adventure Camp in Tanay for medical and survival training as part of the National Service Training Program. \nAround 8:50 a.m., the bus driven by Julian Lacorda Jr. smashed into an electric post and some trees along a curved road in Magnetic Hill in Barangay Sampaloc in Tanay. \nPeralta said based on initial investigation, Lacorda lost control of the wheel and then lost his brakes. \nOne of the survivors said they had smelled a burning tire.   \nBus TXS 325 was the last of the nine buses used for the field trip. \nPeralta said at least 10 students were confirmed dead on the spot. \nAmong the fatalities are Jeid Cabino, Jonahfay Cerezo, Arneline Galauram, Robert Kenneth Pepito, Princess Niña Sentonis and Lovely Siringan. The other fatalities have not been identified as of last night. \nThe injured students aged 18 to 19 were rushed to Rizal Provincial Hospital, Tanay General Hospital, Camp Capinpin Army Station Hospital and Amang Rodriguez Hospital. Other injured students later died in the hospitals. \nEmmanuel Bueno of the Amang Rodriguez Hospital said 19 students were admitted to the hospital. One of them died, one underwent an operation in the abdomen, while one has a popped eye and exposed brain. \nLacorda was declared dead on arrival at the Rizal Provincial Hospital. \nLTFRB to suspend bus firm \nThe Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is set to suspend the operations of the bus company involved in the fatal road accident. \nLTFRB member Aileen Lizada said the agency will issue a 30-day preventive suspension order against Panda Coach Tourist and Transport Inc. \nThe LTFRB will suspend all six active units of the company under its tourist transport shuttle franchise, which is valid until July 2019. \nSince the franchise was issued last July 2016, the company has not been involved in any accident or infraction, according to Lizada . – With Ed Amoroso, Romina Cabrera, Delon Porcalla", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:30:02.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
