Driving btwn Amarillo & Lubbock and saw a meteor so big, bright & close that I slammed my brakes thinking it was going to hit the road. — Lauren Modery (@Hipstercrite) February 27, 2017 \nThe meteor was apparently seen in other states as well, with AMS reporting a total of 31 calls from Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Kansas. \nAMS operation Mike Hankey said remnants of the meteor appeared to be scattered about 50 to 100 miles southeast of Lubbock, and advised locals to “be on the lookout for any weird black rocks,” the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported. \nThis isn’t the first time Lubbock has seen a unique spectacle in its skies. A fireball was reported in the area last year, while local residents eventually recovered more than 100 meteorites produced by a fireball in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:32:20.887+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
