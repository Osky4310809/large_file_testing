The sportier SE model’s side skirts are also now fitted on all variants. \nInside, the Sienna benefits from Toyota’s new Entune 3.0 infotainment system with navigation and App Suite Connect as standard; the LE, SE and XLE gain Entune Audio Plus with Safety Connect and a Wi-Fi Connect hotspot. The Entune 3.0 Premium JBL Audio system on the top-spec Limited adds Dynamic Navigation and Destination Assist, along with nine speakers, a 10.1-inch subwoofer, Sound Staging and Clari-Fi technology. \nOther new features include five USB ports for all three rows, an updated Rear Seat Entertainment with streaming support for Android devices, a Bird’s Eye View monitor on the Limited Premium variant and a 4.3-inch multi-information display. The SE trim also receives a laminated front windscreen, while the Limited variant gets new acoustic front side windows. \nSafety-wise, all Sienna models now come standard with Toyota Safety Sense P, which includes Pre-Collision System (PCS) with Pedestrian Detection, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC) with full speed range, Lane Departure Alert (LDA) with Steering Assist and Automatic High Beam (AHB). \nThe Sienna was already given a new engine and transmission last year, with a 3.5 litre naturally-aspirated Dual VVT-i V6 producing 296 hp at 6,600 rpm and 357 Nm at 4,700 rpm. A Direct Shift eight-speed automatic transmission sends power to the front wheels, with all-wheel drive also available.
