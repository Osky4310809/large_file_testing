Berry played out last season under the tag and said he hoped to avoid doing so again this year, something made easier by the fact that the Chiefs have reportedly made him the highest-paid safety in the league. \nThe team didn’t announce any terms, but multiple reports peg it as a six-year deal worth up to $78 million with $40 million in guarantees. \n“I’d like to thank Eric and his agent, Chad Speck, for their professionalism during these negotiations,” Chiefs General Manager John Dorsey said in a statement from the team. “Keeping Eric Berry in a Chiefs uniform long-term has been a significant goal of ours. He’s a special football player and an incredible person. We’re thrilled we were able to get this deal done.” \nThe Chiefs were busy on Tuesday as they also released veteran running back Jamaal Charles and had guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif in to sign his contract extension. With Berry signed, defensive tackle Dontari Poe now tops the list of potential free agents in Kansas City.
