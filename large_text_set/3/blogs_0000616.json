Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 This 72-Year-Old Grandma Has the Most Killer Brows — and She Just Revealed Her Secrets! \nWhen we think of our grandma's beauty routine, rouge-smothered cheeks and red lipstick immediately come to mind (and a generous spritz of perfume), but this internet sensation — and our new beauty hero — just slammed that stereotype. \nReddit user cultseaa posted a photo of their 72-year-old grandma's eyebrows, writing, \"I just noticed how strong her eyebrow game is.\" We're wondering . . . how could they NOT notice? This image is proof that incredible eyebrows have no age limit. \nThe extended arch, perfect fill, and on-point color put this grandma in the top tier of flawless arches. Cultseaa explained that their grandmother uses It Cosmetics Brow Power Super Skinny ($24) to fill in the brows and Benefit Gimme Brow Volumizing Eyebrow Gel ($24) to get the perfect look, both of which \"she said she orders off QVC or HSN\" and has been \"filling them in for over 40 years.\" Grandma is a trendsetter!
