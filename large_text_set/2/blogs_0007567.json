Are you excited yet? \nIf your answer is yes, I have some good news – you can now display your Valentine’s enthusiasm on social, via stickers, emoji and avocados. \nHere’s a quick summary of the Valentine’s Day celebration options on the major social platforms. Facebook \nAs is becoming the norm for such events, Facebook will be showing users a prompt which enables them to create their own Valentine’s Day card which they can share with a friend or on their own timeline. \nThere are several designs to choose from – Facebook worked with a team of artists and Illustrators in New York and London to come up with the styles and themes. Once you’ve selected the one you want, you can personalize it with your own message, then send. \nAs we’ve reported previously , while prompts like this might seem a little tacky to some, they do work. For example, Facebook’s ‘On This Day’ tool - which highlights things like how long you’ve been friends with someone for or what you posted three years ago - has proven particularly popular, with more than 60 million Facebook users visiting their personal “On This Day” page every day, and 155 million opting to receive dedicated notifications for the feature. \nIndeed, Facebook says that in Valentine’s week last year, they saw a 25% increase in engagement around life events across the network. \nFacebook, of course, is always looking to push personal sharing , and any additional engagement on this front is likely worth the effort – even if only 1% of their 1.2 billion daily active users choose to engage with these prompts, that’s still a huge amount of extra activity. \nOver on Messenger, Facebook’s adding in Valentine’s Day image filters and tools to help you spice up your images.

Add this “Let's Avocuddle” frame, inspired by @GriffinArnlund , to your photos and videos on Messenger. pic.twitter.com/OtRK2AXcmd \nSo, cool, right? Twitter \nOver on Twitter, the platform has already outlined the various Valentine’s Day marketing opportunities, with a listing of key hashtags and keywords that they expect to see in high use. \nTwitter’s expecting to see 31.5 million Valentine’s tweets Valentine’s related tweets this year - up from 26.2 million in 2016 – so it’s a big time for on-platform engagement. \nAs such, Twitter has also published a listing of the most popular love-related hashtags on the network. \nAnd the most used love-related emojis to give you a better idea of what’s likely to be popular on the day. \nTwitter’s also adding a new set of Valentine’s Day themed stickers and a new emoji linked to the #LoveHappens hashtag. Snapchat \nSnapchat has a range of stickers available for the occasion which you can add to your Snaps. \nThey’ve also added a Valentine’s Lens which enables you to blow cloud rings with a themed message. \nSo there’s a range of ways to take part in the celebration. Obviously, there are also a lot of marketing opportunities related to the event, and given the amount of Valentine's related activity expected, it's definitely worth consideration. \nBe prepared for an influx of hearts and pink tones in your social feeds.
