This candid remark has stirred one of Bollywood's biggest scandals, and since the remark was made, many actors including Alia Bhatt, Aamir Khan, and Sonam Kapoor have shared their opinion about preferential treatment in the industry. \nThe latest to have spoken on the matter is Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the supremely talented theatre artist without a famous last name or a godparent in Bollywood, who has earned his place among the who's who.
