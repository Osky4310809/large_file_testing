Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nGeorge Michael’s boyfriend Fadi Fawaz has been cleared of any wrongdoing over the singer's death, it emerged tonight. \nThe tragic star's lover was quizzed by police for a marathon FIVE hours over what happened in the singer's the final hours \nFawaz, 40, later said the police had been “amazing” after two plain-clothed officers questioned him and took his statement last month. \nThe fine art photographer was interviewed twice by police . \nHe spoke to local officers soon after finding George dead in his bed, aged 53, at his £5million Oxfordshire home on Christmas Day. \nAfter a postmortem failed to establish the cause of his death, the detectives from Thames Valley police arranged to interview Fadi at a mews house, where former Spice Girl Geri Horner used to live, near Regents Park, North London. Fad was quizzed by police twice (Photo: Phil Harris / Daily Mirror) \nFadi has been under intense speculation about his relationship with George following his claim that he spent the night sleeping in his car on Christmas Eve. \nIt is understood the decision was taken not to release the body because the first post-mortem proved to be inconclusive. As yet, no funeral has been organised, the MailOnline reported. \nSenior coroner for Oxfordshire, Darren Salter, has yet to open an inquest into the pop star's death on Christmas Day and Thames Valley Police have said they were still awaiting the results of toxicology tests on his body organs to ascertain if drug ingestion had played a factor in the singer's death. \nSpeculation has mounted that the 53-year-old, who was known to have used crack cocaine and heroin in the past, may have turned to narcotics in his final days. \nPolice said the death was still being treated as \"non-suspicious\" although interviews have been carried out in the weeks since. (Photo: Internet Unknown) \nIt is increasingly feared that George died from an overdose of illegal or prescription drugs at his riverside home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxon. \nHe had battled addiction to hard drugs , including crack cocaine as recently as 2015, and was a habitual user of anti-depressants, such as Amitriptyline, and sedatives, to beat severe depression, anxiety and insomnia. \nDetectives are thought to have questioned Fadi, who first started dating George in 2012, on the singer’s movements in the days leading up his death, his physical and mental state and his general lifestyle. \nThere was no suggestion that Fadi has done anything wrong as the death is being treated as “non-suspicious, though unexplained.” \nPolice have also spoken to relatives, friends and neighbours as they piece together his final days for a case file which they will hand over to Oxfordshire Coroner’s Office. (Photo: Instagram) \nThey have asked a leading picture agency Fame Flynet to hand over all shots taken near the singer’s home before Christmas to help identify who came and went before his death. \nFurther toxicology tests on George’s body could take up to eight weeks to complete. \nIt is not known what Fadi has told the police. Publicly, he has made a series of seemingly conflicting statements to the Mirror. \nFadi originally claimed he spent the “whole weekend” at George’s house, adding: “I was there Friday night and then I found him Sunday.” \nBut then Fadi said George and him had spent the night that he died alone because he had fallen asleep in his car. \nHe said: “I never saw him. I fell asleep in my car and I never saw him that night. The police know everything. That’s the most important thing.” \nHe was pictured having coffee alone near George’s house on Christmas Eve and it is unclear why they spent the night apart. \nTweets from Fadi’s account, sent in the early hours of New year’s Day, suggested the star had “wanted to die” and tried to kill himself several times - but he later disowned the comments and claimed he had been hacked. \nGeorge’s publicist labelled the suicide comments “speculation”, but did not deny the claims. (Photo: Rex Features) \nFormer Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Kirkham told the Mirror that Fadi was crucial to the police investigation into George’s death. \nHe said: “As experienced homicide detectives say, “if you want to know how they died, find out how they lived”. \n\"This means speaking at length to those who knew the deceased best and who saw them last. (Photo: Daily Mirror) \n“The Coroner establishes the cause of death, holding an inquest if necessary. \n\"The police assist by presenting the evidence found, including statements from key witnesses. \n“Taking this into account, the police investigations in relation to the death of George Michael appear entirely routine. \n\"They will have searched for, and secured, any drugs at the scene. \n\"And it is no surprise that his partner, Fadi Fawaz, has been interviewed for several hours as he is likely to have the best information in relation to George’s recent health, habits, use of drugs and movements in the days leading up to his death.” \nLast week manager Michael Lippman said he received a call on Christmas morning notifying him that Michael had been found “in bed, lying peacefully.” \nHe said the death was a result of heart failure. \nThames Valley Police said: “As part of Thames Valley Police’s investigation on behalf of Oxfordshire Coroner into this unexplained but non-suspicious death, officers are establishing facts which includes taking statements. \n\"This is standard practice in cases such as this to allow the coroner to determine the circumstances of the death.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:29:11.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
