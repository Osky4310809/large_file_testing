Photo by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP \n  The terror group Islamic State (ISIS) demonstrated a way to turn good technology into something far more malicious with its use of commercial drones as a grenade-delivery weapon. \nTypically used to capture footage from a bird's-eye view, the drones were weaponized – the use of which was first documented in Mosul, a city in Iraq, where Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are currently engaged in a campaign to drive out ISIS from the region. \nKurdish media outlet, Rudaw.net , reported that the group started to use the weaponized drones on the ISF in Mosul, resulting in civilian casualties and equipment damage. Without mentioning specific numbers, the damage being done by these drones is dropping, however, as US Army Colonel Brett Sylvia noted in the report. \nThe ISF also uses drones in their operations but not to deliver explosives. \nSylvia, who leads the US task force working with the ISF, said they have successfully taken down the drones – at least 12 of them – and that the number of drones being used is dropping. To counter them, gun-like signal-jamming devices bring down these deadly devices before they can deliver their payload. \nBecause the drones being used by the terror group do not carry military-grade technology, basic jamming countermeasures have reportedly worked effectively. Standard rifles have also been used to combat the relatively slow-flying commercial drones. \nThese were some of the captured drones as posted by retired US special forces officer Mitchell Utterback: A photo posted by Mitch Utterback (@mitchell.utterback) on Jan 12, 2017 at 8:53pm PST A photo posted by Mitch Utterback (@mitchell.utterback) on Jan 7, 2017 at 11:55pm PST \nAs Popular Mechanics reports, this is not the first time that ISIS used drones as tools in warfare. They've been used as scouts, explosive decoys, and as single-use weapons in the past. They've also been used to film propaganda such as clips of exploding car-bombs . \nOpposing forces have been able to neutralize them so far, but the report also warned that the weaponization of these off-the-shelf devices is a growing field of research among insurgents – and not just ISIS. \nThis means that in the continuing war against ISIS, it's likely that the seemingly innocuous drone – a mere gadget or toy for some – will continue to take on experimental, weaponized forms. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
