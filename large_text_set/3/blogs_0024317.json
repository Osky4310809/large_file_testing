Olanusi who was the deputy governor of the immediate former governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, was impeached by the Ondo State House of Assembly in 2015 for alleged gross misconduct. He also joined the All Progressives Congress shortly before the presidential election in 2015, before his impeachment. The 79-page judgement by Justice Muhammed Danjuma was delivered at about 5pm on Friday. The court held that the impeachment of Olanusi was not in accordance with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution and was not given a fair hearing. He ordered that all privileges and entitlements due to the former deputy governor from the time of his removal from office till 24 February this year, when his tenure was supposed to expire should be restored. A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos had earlier struck out the case filed by Olanusi to challenge his impeachment on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.
