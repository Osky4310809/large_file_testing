There are more F-bombs per minute here than there are in “GoodFellas.”\nNothing says “anti-fascism” like demanding that the state physically attack your political opponents. A taste:\n“You should kick their ass!” the professor declared, referring to McInnes and his entourage. “You should!”\nNote that the professor—a dead ringer for Melissa Click, by the way—considered violence to be beneath her and her owns students.\n“These are kids who are trying to learn about humanity!” she said. “They’re trying to learn about human rights and against racism and xenophobia, and LGBTQ rights, and you’re letting these f***ing neo-nazis near here! It’s not up to these students to kick the ass of a neo-nazi! They don’t have to raise their fist! They were taught to be peaceful! F*** you!”\nAccording to Washington Square News , McInnes was pepper-sprayed by someone before he even made it to the podium. He got three minutes into his speech before he was first interrupted, and by 20 minutes in the crowd was so rowdy that he had to stop. More:\nSenior Vice President of Student Affairs Marc Wais tried calming the crowd multiple times and asked everybody to return to their seats immediately, but after failing multiple times, McInnes made fun of Wais as well.\n“You’re ridiculous sir,” McInnes said after taking the microphone from Wais. “You’re dumb, liberal a**hole.”\nThe crowd of protesters cheered after McInnes framed Wais as a supporter of the liberal left. After the event, Wais said that that this incident was a follow-up to what happened last night at University of California, Berkeley.\n“We are living in a new normal,” Wais said.\nIndeed we are. Campus leftists having mental breakdowns when a right-wing provocateur comes to campus is nothing new, but between this and the Berkeley riots over Milo Yiannopoulos, we may have reached a “new normal” in the sense that this sort of reception on campus is now not just foreseeable, it’s expected . Shutting down a speech may no longer be enough; a truly virtuous “anti-fascist” statement may require burning something, physically attacking the speaker, or, at a minimum, having the sort of theatrical fit that you’re about to see. There seems to be a religious ecstasy to it. I wonder who’ll end up benefiting. Exit quotation from the president of the United States : “Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T18:34:16.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
