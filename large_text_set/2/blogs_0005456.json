We'll have to wait and see.\" A collection of Bernie Ecclestone's best sound bites from his Sky Sports F1 interviews in recent years \nF1's new management team has outlined early plans to grow the sport's revenue and popularity, in addition to devising ways to make the sport more competitive on the track. \nThe prize-money structure has long been a bone of contention for smaller teams and speculation has suggested Liberty could create a more even distribution model once the majority of teams' commercial deals expire in 2020. \nBrawn: F1 must support smaller teams \nSeveral larger teams are awarded heritage payments while Ferrari receive an additional annual bonus to recognise their status as F1's longest-serving outfit. \nAsked about the prospect of cutting the money paid to Ferrari, Mosley said: \"If it would me I'd do it immediately. \n\"The thing is Ferrari are always going to get more sponsorship than the other teams, so to give them the same money from the money you have control of, which is the FOM [Formula One Management] money, it's completely fair and then they get extra money because they are famous and because they have sponsorship. \n\"But the fundamental problem is if you've got three times as much money as me you may as well have a bigger engine, you've got a huge advantage. That plays out in inequality between the cars and the drivers. \n\"So I'd rather see something where everybody had the same money to spend and the cleverest engineer would make the best car and the best driver would drive better than the other drivers. But you're never going to make it work where you've got two or three teams with far more money than the rest. Apart from anything else, it's very unfair.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:17:32.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
