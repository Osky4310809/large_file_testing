King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 3 \nHere's a bit of a fun fact: Metallica's concert in Shanghai, China last night marked the band's first headlining gig since 1985 (so first gig in around 32 years) NOT to feature at least one song from their classic album \" Master of Puppets .\" \nBy headlining gig we mean standard headlining concerts with full-size setlists, so special events with trimmed-down setlists are not included. \nIt is worth noting, though, that several songs were not played due to the Chinese government's censorship, including \" One ,\" \" Creeping Death ,\" and \" Master of Puppets .\" \nAnyhow, you can check out the full setlist below via Setlist.fm . In related stuff, official pro-shot footage of Metallica debuting new songs \" Now That We're Dead \" and \" Halo on Fire \" has also surfaced. Consult the video players at the bottom for the goods.
