Alleged LeEco Le 2S with 5.5-inch 1080p display and dual rear cameras spotted on TENAA By February 22, 2017 “The Le 2S will feature two 13-megapixel cameras on the back with a dual-LED flash” \nMultiple reports in the past have suggested that LeEco is working on a new smartphone called the Le 2S. Ahead of the unveiling, a couple of live images of the LeEco Le 2S hit the interwebs. Now two LeEco phones dubbed LEX656 and LEX659 have spotted on the Chinese certification agency TENAA’s website. They are rumoured to launch as the LeEco Le 2S and Le 2S Dual respectively. \nAs per TENAA , the LeEco Le 2S will feature two 13-megapixel primary cameras on the back, aided by a dual-LED flash. The phone will come with a metal unibody design with its antenna bands placed on the edges of top and bottom of the rear panel, and a fingerprint sensor located below the camera. The device will come with a 5.5-inch full HD display, and will be powered by a 2.3GHz deca-core SoC, mated to 4GB of RAM. \nThe Le 2S will feature an 8-megapixel front-facing shooter for selfies. The phone will boot Android 6.0 Marshmallow and will be fuelled by a beefy 3,900mAh battery. The LeEco LEX659 is the same as the LEX656 as far as the key features and design are concerned. It is expected to be launched as the dual-SIM variant of the LEX656. There’s no word when the brand is planning to launch the phones as of now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:20:43.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
