In January, 24-year-old Angel Castro was sentenced to four years in state prison after pleading no contest to charges of vandalism and robbery in connection with the incident, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nThe coverage moved dozens of people to clean off the graffiti, but in the cleaning process, dozens of the 2,237 names were wiped away. The Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC), tracked the full list of names that were on the wall from the estate of the original artist, Patrick Stewart.\n“This was a great investigative piece of our work,” SPARC Founder Judy Baca said.\nSPARC will begin restoring the memorial next week. Then crews will add an invisible coating to protect it from any future graffiti. The coating will allow the graffiti to be washed off.\n“It’s very light water spray,” Baca said. “And the graffiti will not attach to the mural shield that we’ve put on it.”\nThe mural was painted in the early 1990s by Stewart and bears the names of soldiers counted as prisoners of war or missing in action in Vietnam.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:12:44.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
