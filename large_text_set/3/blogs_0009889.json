Every woman knows her face,” a voiceover says. “When she walks into a room, all eyes are on her.” \n“She’s Ivanka,” the narrator says. “And a woman like her deserves a fragrance all her own. A scent made just for her. Because she’s beautiful. She’s powerful. She’s…Complicit.” \n“She’s a woman who knows what she wants, and knows what she’s doing. Complicit,” the narrator adds. \n“She doesn’t crave the spotlight, but we see her. Oh, how we see her,” the narrator continues as Ivanka stares into a mirror and sees her father — portrayed by Alec Baldwin — as her reflection. \n“A feminist. An advocate. A champion for women,” the narrator continues. “But, like, how?” \n“She’s loyal, devoted, but probably should have bounced after the whole ‘Access Hollywood’ bus thing,” the narrator says. \n“Complicit: The fragrance for the woman who could stop all of this,” the narrator says,” the narrator concludes, “but won’t.” \nAt the very end, the narrator says the new perfume is “also available in a cologne for Jared,” referencing Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, who also serves as a senior adviser to the president. \nThe message of the skit is clear: that Ivanka, who has asserted herself as a champion for women’s rights and many progressive issues like climate change, could “stop” her father from implementing the agenda he campaigned on but liberals don’t like. But because Ivanka is standing by her father, the ad implies that Ivanka is “complicit” in anything Trump does that liberals don’t like or that doesn’t work. \nThis is the first time the actors of “SNL” have directly attacked Ivanka in a political skit. \nTrump, usually outspoken about “SNL,” has yet to make a comment or tweet about Saturday’s skit, though it likely grabbed his attention. \nTrump was forced to defend Ivanka last month after a barrage of retailers began dropping her clothing and jewelry lines amid a boycott of anything Trump. \nWatch the skit below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T17:10:06.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
