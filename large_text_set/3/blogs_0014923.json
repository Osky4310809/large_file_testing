View this image › \nNatCen/BuzzFeed \nID: 10738489 A majority of Remain and Leave voters want EU citizens to face the same immigration rules as non-EU citizens after the UK leaves the European Union. Unsurprisingly, Leave voters are much more likely to back this policy, but a clear majority (58%) of Remain voters back this too.\nVoters also expect and support prospective British emigrants to the EU facing the same restrictions as non-EU citizens – suggesting that on this issue at least, the UK is not asking for unequal treatment: 86% of Leave voters and 54% of Remain voters think UK citizens should face immigration checks in EU nations.\nView this image › \nNatCen/BuzzFeed \nID: 10738492 Finally, 77% of Leave and 51% of Remain voters want EU citizens to be completely ineligible for any UK welfare benefits – which would likely mean UK citizens across the EU would receive the same treatment in turn.\nRemain and Leave voters overwhelmingly want to be able to trade freely with the EU. View this image › \nNatCen/BuzzFeed \nID: 10738485 More than on any other issue, the vast majority of voters want to be able to continue trading freely with the EU after Brexit – which could prove a difficult challenge for May, who has committed to leaving the Single Market and Customs Union, which allow for tariff-free trading without customs checks.\nView this image › \nNatCen / BuzzFeed \nID: 10738732 However, despite backing free trade, most Remain and Leave supporters want to reintroduce customs checks at the UK border – which most free trade deals try to eliminate – suggesting a certain degree of confusion as to which aspects of free trade genuinely enjoy public support.\nUK voters – Leave and Remain alike – want to keep other perks of EU membership post-Brexit. View this image › \nNatCen/BuzzFeed \nID: 10738486 The two charts above show that 83% of Remain and 67% of Leave voters want to retain EU regulations governing clean water at beaches, and 80% of Remain and 67% of Leave voters also want to keep EU rules which keep roaming charges for UK travellers across the EU to a minimum.\nA majority of UK voters – however they voted in the referendum – also want to keep EU rules on compensating passengers after flight delays, as well as continuing to participate in EU-wide university research programmes.\nView this image › \nNatCen/BuzzFeed \nID: 10738487 Voters were also asked whether they wanted an end to free healthcare across the EU for British tourists – and perhaps unsurprisingly, most did not: only 28% of Remainers and 46% of Leavers supported this proposition.\nView this image › \nNatCen/BuzzFeed \nID: 10738497 Similarly, a majority of voters want to keep EU rules governing which pesticides farms can use. In a rare case of Remain and Leave voters being divided, though, Remain voters want to keep EU rules on the minimum amount annual leave to which UK workers are entitled (currently 20 days plus national holidays), while Leave voters narrowly wish to scrap them.\nView this image › \nNatCen/BuzzFeed \nID: 10738498 Remain voters would sacrifice controlling our borders to keep free trade. Leave voters wouldn’t. View this image › \nNatCen / BuzzFeed \nID: 10738738 Remain and Leave voters might both agree on wanting to be able to have greater control over UK immigration rules on EU citizens – but their priorities differ when it comes to picking one over the other.\nAround three-quarters of Remain voters say the UK “definitely” or “probably” should allow free movement in exchange for free trade if that’s the choice the UK ends up facing at the negotiating table – while only around one in three leave voters say the same.\nPerhaps more interesting still is the fact that Labour voters are more likely to prioritise free trade than Conservative supporters – a reversal of the parties’ traditional positions on free trade, though the Tory voters are very narrowly divided, spelling out a potential future headache for the prime minister.\nView this image › \nNatCen / BuzzFeed \nID: 10738752 “The stance taken by the UK government of wanting to end freedom of movement but maintain free trade fits well with the views of most Conservative voters,” said Curtice. “But it also means that they are also the group that are most likely to be disappointed if they were to come to the conclusion that the government has failed to achieve that objective. Theresa May could be faced with political difficulties at home if she struggles to achieve her key objectives in Brussels.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:13:46.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
