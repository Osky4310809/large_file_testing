Bonds retired from the sport at 42 years old and finished his last season with 28 homers. He holds a bunch of different MLB records, including most home runs in a single season (73) and the most career home runs (762). Not too shabby. \nSo is the former MLB great prepping for a comeback? Probably not. Bonds still has a substantial amount of controversy following him around, mostly to do with his disputed use of performance-enhancing drugs. It's impossible to say whether or not Bonds is using steroids today. Either way, it's still pretty impressive that the former great is still mashing dingers 10 years after retirement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:27:36.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
