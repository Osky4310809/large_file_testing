(AP) — Animal control officers have recovered a four-to-five foot juvenile anaconda from an Arlington County resident’s toilet.\nThe Animal Welfare League of Arlington said Tuesday it received a call Dec. 27 about a snake found in the toilet of an apartment building in South Arlington.\nA control officer retrieved the snake, which was determined to be a juvenile yellow anaconda.\nChelsea Lindsey, a spokeswoman for the Animal Welfare League, said the snake is probably four or five feet long, but they don’t have a precise measurement because the snake was frightened and remained coiled.\nYellow anacondas can grow to 13 feet in length.\nThe Animal Welfare League said they placed the snake with a specialist who is taking care of it.\n \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
