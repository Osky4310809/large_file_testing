Like the name suggests, Shuttle is basically a bus.\nLyft users in those two cities can request a Lyft Line like they normally would, and then see the option to switch to a Shuttle if they are near one of the preset Shuttle routes. Those routes have preset pickup and dropoff points, like, again, a bus.\nSEE ALSO: So how many customers actually deleted their Uber accounts?\nShuttle will only be available during weekday commuter hours, from 6:30 to 10 a.m. and 4 to 8 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.\nThe cost of a Shuttle ride is fixed — sort of. It won't have surge pricing applied, but like a regular taxi the price can change depending on time and distance. So an actual bus is definitely more reliable price-wise.\nShuttle service will operate within Lyft Line, Lyft's ride-pooling service. Lyft won't yet say when the service will roll out to other cities and customers.\nSEE ALSO: Lyft already met its 2017 goal to expand to 100 new cities\nThe startup Chariot tried something similar in San Francisco and Austin. And Uber is experimenting with a commute option in D.C.'s suburbs.\n\"Lyft Line is the future of rideshare, and we often test new features that we believe will have positive impact on our passengers' transportation options,\" Lyft said through a spokesperson. \"We look forward to feedback on Shuttle from the Lyft community; we see a number of commuting use cases that this mode will make easier.”\nWATCH: This futuristic tiny home switches rooms by rotating like a washing machine", "external_links": ["https://www.chariot.com/", "http://wtop.com/dc-transit/2017/03/uber-set-test-digital-slugging/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/R5jXMuxr.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vbCgqOouMyzXT2beyp_rAAYq-YA=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2FR5jXMuxr.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-30T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:43:19.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
