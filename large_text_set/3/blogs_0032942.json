Moyn and Monir Islam promoting OneCoin owner OneLife \nWell, they don't believe in it any more. \n“We were making multiple six figures a month, but as time went by for the last months, things have started to blur up quite a bit,” they've now said during a live online forum. \nThe pair claimed that they started to question OneLife, the parent company behind OneCoin, but could not get the answers they wanted. \n“We don't want to live in the dark, we don't want to continue to promote something where we no longer have the answers,” they said. \nThey did not say what the questions were, but if it was me the first one would have been: “Since you cannot trade OneCoin, how can you make money from it other than getting commission for bringing in new recruits?” Moyn and Monir Islam were carried shoulder high at OneLife rally \nMoyn – or maybe Monir – went on to say: “The money we are making right now, we don't feel good about it. \n“We cannot continue to promote a company we can no longer call home.” \nThis must come as a shock to those listeners who were so recently sold the OneCoin dream by the brothers through their business ODTGoPro . \nSo how did the pair placate them? \nIt turns out they've moved into a new venture, “wearable technology”. \nIt's a gizmo called Helo which you wear on your wrist and it can do stuff like monitor your heart rate – the brothers were vague on detail. \n“Wearable technology is to be £34billion by 2020,” they claimed. \n“By us having the number one product on this planet, can we be at least worth £2billion by 2020? Absolutely yes, if not more.” \nReally? The company behind Helo is called World Media & Technology Corp, its shares trade in tiny volumes on one of the smaller United States markets and have halved in value this year. \nBut never mind the product, the money lies in getting commission by bringing in more recruits. \n“Why are you networking? To make commission, that is the reality,” one of the pair admitted. \nThey spoke of an 18-year-old with no network marketing background who made £40,000 in her first month flogging Helo, and a couple who made £630,000 last year. \nYou get 10% commission. Persuade someone to buy the family pack of four wristbands and that's about £107. \nUp on screen flashed a chart showing how your network would build if you recruit two people, the next week they each recruit two, then they all recruit two each, and so it doubles every week. \nBy week five that's 4095 people and $409,500 is yours if they all bought a particular Helo pack, according to the chart. \nBut the figures were all over the place. Week 5 on the chart is followed by another week 5, then after week 7 you'd expect week 8 but the chart doubles back to week 2. Projected earnings from selling Helo wristbands don't add up \nLike most similar networking schemes, this one comes with risible titles, the brothers said their aim is to become President Millionaires. \nThere were outlandish promises, such as a free Rolls Royce Ghost for top performers. \nAnd there was pressure selling, with warnings of the opportunities missed if you leave it too late to join. \n“We have started three days ago, 200 people have signed up, we can do this together, you can choose to sign up,” they urged. \nSo, if I can paraphrase, the message to disillusioned people roped into OneCoin by the Islam brothers amounts to: “Give us some more money and join us on another half-baked scheme”. \nWhat must really rankle, is that they make it sound like they're doing you a favour.
