The two actors decided that they’d lock lips just as Gosling was making his way to the stage to accept his award.\nOf course, the kiss had a really sweet and touching explanation . Garfield explained that he just wanted Reynolds to know that he was still loved, despite not picking up the award, for which is was also nominated for his role in Deadpool .\n“I just wanted him to know that it doesn’t matter [if you win or lose], it’s how you play the game. He showed up, he gave his all, it doesn’t change anything in my heart,” he said.\nLMAOOO did anyone else peep @VancityReynolds and Andrew Garfield kiss? #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/Fm0PCBCrpj \n— (@alexvxn) January 9, 2017 Well, now Ryan Gosling has responded to the kiss and he’s only got nice things to say. Speaking to metro.co.uk, Gosling was quizzed about what he made of the kiss.\n“‘I’m happy for them,” he said. “I’m happy they found each other.” When asked whether he would share a kiss with Garfield, however, he wasn’t too keen.\n“It means less now,” he said. “It’s less special.” Well, there go our dreams of a full on Hollywood A-lister kiss-a-thon.\nGosling isn’t the only person to have a rather humorous reaction to Garfield and Reynolds’ kiss. Emma Stone, who also stars in La La Land and was previously in a relationship with Garfield, was shown the steamy moment backstage at the Golden Globes, and she couldn’t quite believe what she was seeing. \n#EmmaStone couldn't believe #AndrewGarfield & #RyanReynolds locked lips during #RyanGosling's acceptance speech. #GoldenGlobes \nA video posted by Entertainment Tonight (@entertainmenttonight) on Jan 8, 2017 at 9:03pm PST \nTbh, we’re totally shipping Andrew Garfield and Ryan Reynolds, and, like Mr Gosling, we wish them all the best in the future.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T12:21:20.772+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
