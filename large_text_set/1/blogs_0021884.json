She was 80.\nMoore gained fame in the 1960s as the frazzled wife Laura Petrie on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\" In the 1970s, she created one of TV's first career-woman sitcom heroines in \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\"\nShe won seven Emmy awards over the years and was nominated for an Oscar for her 1980 portrayal of an affluent mother whose son is accidentally killed in \"Ordinary People.\"\nActress Mary Tyler Moore dies at 80 Beloved TV icon Mary Tyler Moore has died at 80. Here's a look at her career. (Jan. 25, 2017)\nBeloved TV icon Mary Tyler Moore has died at 80. Here's a look at her career. (Jan. 25, 2017)\nSee more videos She had battled diabetes for many years. In 2011, she underwent surgery to remove a benign tumor on the lining of her brain.\nMoore's first major TV role was on the classic sitcom \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" in which she played the young homemaker wife of Van Dyke's character, comedy writer Rob Petrie, from 1961-66.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nWith her unerring gift for comedy, Moore seemed perfectly fashioned to the smarter wit of the new, post-Eisenhower age. As Laura, she traded in the housedress of countless sitcom wives and clad her dancer's legs in Capri pants that were as fashionable as they were suited to a modern American woman.\nLaura was a dream wife and mother, but not perfect. Viewers identified with her flustered moments and her protracted, plaintive cry to her husband: \"Ohhhh, Robbbb!\"\nMoore's chemistry with Van Dyke was unmistakable. Decades later, he spoke warmly of the chaste but palpable off-screen crush they shared during the show's run.\nThey also appeared together in several TV specials over the years and in 2003, co-starred in a PBS production of the play \"The Gin Game.\"\nBut it was as Mary Richards, the plucky Minneapolis TV news producer on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" (1970-77), that Moore truly made her mark.\nAt a time when women's liberation was catching on worldwide, her character brought to TV audiences an independent, 1970s career woman. Other than Marlo Thomas' 1960s sitcom character \"That Girl,\" who at least had a steady boyfriend, there were few precedents.\nMary Richards was comfortable being single in her 30s, and while she dated, she wasn't desperate to get married. She sparred affectionately with her gruff boss, Lou Grant, played by Ed Asner and addressed always as \"Mr. Grant.\" And millions agreed with the show's theme song that she could \"turn the world on with her smile.\"\nVideo: The end of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' Watch the final scene from \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\"\nWatch the final scene from \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\"\nSee more videos The show was filled with laughs. But no episode was more memorable than the bittersweet finale when new management fired the entire WJM News staff — everyone but the preening, clueless anchorman, Ted Baxter. Thus did the series dare to question whether Mary Richards actually did \"make it after all.\"\nThe series ran seven seasons and won 29 Emmys, a record that stood for a quarter century until \"Frasier\" broke it in 2002.\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" spawned the spin-offs \"Rhoda,\" (1974-78), starring Valerie Harper; \"Phyllis\" (1975-77), starring Cloris Leachman; and \"Lou Grant\" (1977-82), starring Asner in a rare drama spun off from a comedy.\nMary Richards \"certainly was never a character that I had to develop when we were doing the show,\" Moore said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press. \"Everything I did was by the seat of the pants. I reacted to every written situation the way I would have in real life.\"\nShe likened being linked with that role to \"growing up with a mother who is a very famous actress. There are all kinds of wonderful perks that go with it, and then there are little resentments, too.\n\"My life is inextricably intertwined with Mary Richards', and probably always will be,\" she said.\n\"Mary Tyler Moore\" was the first in a series of acclaimed, award-winning shows she produced with her second husband, Grant Tinker, who died in November 2016, through their MTM Enterprises. (The meowing kitten at the end of the shows was a parody of the MGM lion.) \"The Bob Newhart Show,\" ''Hill Street Blues,\" ''St. Elsewhere\" and \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" are among the MTM series that followed.\nMoore won her seventh Emmy in 1993, for supporting actress in a miniseries or special, for a Lifetime network movie, \"Stolen Babies.\" She had won two for \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and the other four for \"Mary Tyler Moore.\"\nAt the time, her seven tied her with former co-star Asner for the record of prime-time Emmy acting wins. Another co-star, Leachman, later surpassed them with eight prime-time Emmys in acting and variety show categories.\n'Mary Tyler Moore' co-stars and celebs react to star's death Tribune news services Hollywood paid tribute to Mary Tyler Moore on Wednesday, soon after news of her death was announced.\nThe TV icon, known for \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and her own \"Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" died Wednesday at 80 years old.\nEd Asner, who played Moore's boss in the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" was one of the...\nHollywood paid tribute to Mary Tyler Moore on Wednesday, soon after news of her death was announced.\nThe TV icon, known for \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and her own \"Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" died Wednesday at 80 years old.\nEd Asner, who played Moore's boss in the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" was one of the...\n(Tribune news services) In 2012, Moore received the Screen Actors Guild's lifetime achievement award.\nMoore never achieved the individual success with a television series that she enjoyed with \"Mary Tyler Moore.\"\nShe starred in two different programs called \"Mary\" — one, a comedy/variety hour similar to \"The Carol Burnett Show,\" lasted only a few episodes in 1978. Another variety show, \"The Mary Tyler Moore Hour,\" spent a few months on the air in 1979.\nThe second \"Mary,\" a sitcom in which Moore played a divorced Chicago newspaper columnist, bounced between time slots for about six months before being canceled in 1986.\nThen in fall 1986, another flop: \"Annie McGuire,\" in which she played a divorced woman who had remarried for the second time. It lasted just two months.\nShe also asked to be written out of \"New York News,\" a drama set at a newspaper, which aired for two months in 1995.\nOn the big screen, Moore's appearances were less frequent. She was a 1920s flapper in the hit 1967 musical \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\" and a nun who falls for Elvis Presley in \"Change of Habit\" in 1969.\nShe turned to serious drama in 1980's \"Ordinary People,\" playing an affluent, bitter mother who loses a son in an accident. The film won the Oscar for best picture and best director for Robert Redford, and it earned Moore an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe. She also played the mother of a dying girl in 1982's \"Six Weeks\" and real-life cancer survivor Betty Rollin in a 1978 TV movie, \"First You Cry.\"\nMoore endured personal tragedy in real life, too. The same year \"Ordinary People\" came out, her only child, Richard, who'd had trouble in school and with drugs, accidentally shot himself at 24. Her younger sister, Elizabeth, died at 21 from a combination of a painkillers and alcohol.\nIn her 1995 autobiography \"After All,\" Moore admitted she helped her terminally ill brother try to commit suicide by feeding him ice cream laced with a deadly overdose of drugs. The attempt failed, and her 47-year-old brother, John, died three months later in 1992 of kidney cancer.\nMoore herself lived with juvenile diabetes for some 40 years and told of her struggle in her 2009 book, \"Growing Up Again.\" She also spent five weeks at the Betty Ford Clinic in 1984 for alcohol abuse, writing that they \"transformed my life — and gave me a chance to start growing up — even at my advanced age ... of 45.\"\nShe served as chairwoman of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, supported embryonic stem cell research and was active in animal rights causes.\nIn 1983, Moore married cardiologist Robert Levine, who survives her. Her marriage to Tinker lasted from 1962 to 1981. Before that, she was married to Dick Meeker from 1955 to 1961.\nMoore was born in 1936 in Brooklyn; the family moved to California when she was around 8 years old.\nShe began dancing lessons as a child and launched her career while still in her teens, appearing in TV commercials. In the mid-'50s, she was a dancing sprite called \"Happy Hotpoint\" in Hotpoint appliance ads.\nOne of her early TV series roles was as a secretary who was unseen, except for her legs, on \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective.\"\nShe arrived at \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" at age 24, a dancer with few acting credits and scant evidence of any gift for being funny.\nDecades later, Carl Reiner, who created the show, still marveled at the comic genius he discovered and nurtured.\n\"She was a very quick study,\" he recalled in 2014. \"It didn't take her very long.\"\nIt was start of a comic legacy.\nIn 1992, Moore received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. A decade later, a life-size bronze statue went on display in Minneapolis, depicting her tossing her trademark tam into the air as she did in the opening credits of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\"\nAssociated Press\nRELATED STORIES:\nMary Tyler Moore brought magic to American living rooms\nMary Tyler Moore taught us to face changing times with joy and spunk\nMary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke's reunion in 'The Gin Game' went beyond simple nostalgia\nMary Tyler Moore's taboo-breaking shows seen in new light\nShandling's 'Sanders,' 'Mary Tyler Moore' top list of TV workplace comedies\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCopyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Obituaries Valerie Harper Cloris Leachman", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58890c30/turbine/ct-mary-tyler-moore-dead-reaction-20170125", "http://d3ik2vfsvyg6fu.cloudfront.net/a/embed.html#layout=", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-588916a8/turbine/sns-actress-mary-tyler-moore-dies-at-20170125", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5889053b/turbine/ct-2017-notable-deaths-20170110", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-588916b7/turbine/ct-mary-tyler-moore-last-show-20170125", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58802909/turbine/chi-movie-reviews-pictures-pg", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58890114/turbine/ct-mary-tyler-moore-dead-20170125"], "published": "2017-01-26T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T01:22:26.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
