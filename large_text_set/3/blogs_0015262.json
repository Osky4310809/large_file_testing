After fighting to take down Planned Parenthood in Congress for Indiana, he became governor and took it to a state level… \nPence is scoring the award because Kellyanne Conway is on the organization’s board. Jezebel notes the irony of a group that celebrates “personal liberty” while awarding a man who opposes the personal liberty of women. \nIn related news, Rep. Steve King is going to be receiving the Working for the Rights of Non-White People Award by the Independent Totally Not Racist White People of America Foundation and Donald Trump will be getting the Keeping His Hands Off Women Who Don’t Consent Award from the Fat Pigs and Slobs Association of Greater New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:45:12.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
