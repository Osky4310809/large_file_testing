Bodies had begun turning up in cities all over the Philippines ever since President Rodrigo Duterte launched a controversial war on drugs this year. Drug dealers and drug addicts, were being shot by police or slain by unidentified gunmen in mysterious, gangland-style murders that were taking place at night. AP/Aaron Favila \n  The new year brings new hope for Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa who looks to end the campaign against illegal drugs in 2017. \nDespite exceeding the three to six months vow of Duterte administration, Dela Rosa advised the whole PNP force to just focus on their mandates and not to dwell on criticisms. \n“Basta kami no let-up kami sa aming operations. Sabi ko sa kapulisan ko huwag kayo magpapa-distract diyan sa mga criticisms, ‘yung mga pambabatikos, we have to concentrate on our jobs,” the PNP chief said in a press briefing at Camp Crame on Monday. \n“We have to finish this problem sana before 2017 ends… ma-declare natin (ang) buong Pilipinas na drug-free,” he added. \nDela Rosa wished that it could be done this year as he told his wards to avoid being involved in wrongdoing. \n“ Tuloy lang ang trabaho, huwag kayo gumawa ng illegal dahil mali 'yan,” he said. Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nDrug policy experts, however, have noted that no country has been declared free of illegal narcotics as anti-drug campaigns in previous years around the world focused on police measures that often translated to violent crackdowns. The demand for illegal drugs, however, has remained more or less constant. \nExperts instead suggest proper management of the drug problem by governments instead having a zero-drug target. \nIn the Philippines, the administration of President Duterte has been criticized for thousands of deaths in police operations and in killings of drug suspects by unknown assailants. \nMeanwhile, the PNP chief credited the lower number of drug-related deaths from 30 a day last year to five to six a day in recent weeks to fewer resistance to arrest in their operations. \nREAD: Drug killings down to 5 a day \n“Baka kumokonti na ‘yung mga pusher na lumalaban kaya kumakaunti na 'yung mga namamatay,” Dela Rosa said. \nDuring the campaign season last year, then Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte promised to eradicate drugs and crime with three to six months. Months after assuming post, the President asked for extension after realizing how big the problem is.
