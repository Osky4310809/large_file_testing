Her actions also introduced us to Julian Assange's WikiLeaks. Yet, Manning will only have served seven years in prison as Obamaâ€™s announcement guarantees her a May release. \nSome of the other commutations Obama granted on Tuesday included prisoners who faced life sentences for drug charges. In all, he shortened the sentences of 209 convicts and offered 64 pardons. \nThis isn't the first time Obama has set a record with his commutations. In December, he granted 153 commutations in a single day. \nThe White House said on Tuesday that the president's pardons will give these Americans a \"second chance.\" BREAKING: With 209 commutations and 64 pardons, @POTUS just gave 273 Americans a second chance.
