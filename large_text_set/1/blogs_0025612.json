the only area of mainland Scotland to do so for this period. \n\"The introduction of the railway has undoubtedly contributed to these figures.\" \nMidlothian Council's Jim Bryant said the railway was introducing more people to the area's \"wonderful scenery and world-class attractions\". \n\"We were always confident that Borders Railway would bring new jobs, more tourists and significant economic opportunities to the area,\" he said. \n\"These figures are testament to the fact, these benefits are already under way.\" 'New investment' \nTransport Minister Humza Yousaf added that the opening of the railway had been \"cause for celebration\" in the area. \n\"We were always confident that, in time, it would deliver major economic opportunities and attract new investment,\" he said. \n\"It is therefore very pleasing to see strong evidence that visits are up significantly, alongside spending, as a direct result of the railway.\" \nDanny Cusick, director of tourism at Scottish Enterprise, said it had \"always been confident\" the line would attract visitors. \nVisitScotland Chief Executive Malcolm Roughead said the figures were evidence that the \"enormous tourism investment\" was having a \"real impact on the local economy\". \nAlasdair Smart, the ScotRail Alliance's tourism manager, said it was proud to play its part in creating a \"positive Borders Railway experience\".
