Those of us who don’t have significant others can apply with a friend — but choose your application buddy carefully because you’ll be spending a whole lot of quality time together on a remote island .

Plus, the Bureau of Meteorology will train and pay you to carry out daily weather observations. Maatsuyker Island is the southernmost point of the Australian continental shelf. The lighthouse was built in 1891, and is now automated but manned for weather observations. The island is subject to extreme weather conditions with the winds of the Roaring Forties having been recorded at 176km (110 miles) per hour. It is also known for its large seabird population.
