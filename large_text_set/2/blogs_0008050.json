The issue was that she’d parked in an area that’s a ‘no parking zone’ from 8 to 10pm. The woman had parked there at 9:59, and got out of her car when the clock on the dashboard said 10pm.\nInstead of acting like a human being with any semblance of a soul, the meter maid fuckboi took it upon themselves to write this woman a parking ticket and stamped the date/time at 9:59:58… TWO FUCKING SECONDS before she was legally allowed to park there.\nThe law is the law, and she was clearly in violation of the ‘no parking zone’ hours for a whole two seconds. But you have to be one evil son of a bitch to write someone a parking ticket for a 2-second violation. NBA refs don’t even call players on 3-second violations these days and some dickhead wrote this woman a ticket for getting out of her car with 2 seconds to spare.\nNow, this judge was a total bro about it and cracked some jokes before dismissing the case entirely. But surely there must have been other people there with much more pressing cases/offences trying to get in front of the judge. How is this an appropriate use of a judge’s time/resources? Hearing the case of a woman who parked in a spot TWO FUCKING SECONDS before she was allowed to….unreal.\n[ h/t r/videos ] \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:02:28.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
