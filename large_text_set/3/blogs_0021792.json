Moussa Dembele has a number of admirers (Photo: REUTERS) \nArsenal offered £40m for Lacazette last summer and remain keen while it could take a record breaking offer for Mbappe who is the hottest prospect in Europe. Arsenal have been watching Dembele and believe he could be lured to London. Lacazette is in fine form this season (Photo: AFP) \nThey want a new keeper with David Ospina set to go and Stoke’s Jack Butland is top of the list while Jordan Pickford and Joe Hart are also on their radar. \nCeltic’s young left back Kieran Tierney is another target. Valencia’s Jose Gaya has also been watched but Manchester City are in pole position. \nThat could raise doubts over Nacho Moreal’s future while Kieran Gibbs has one year left on his contract this summer which is also the case for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere. Wilshere's Arsenal future is in doubt (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nManchester City are watching developments on Wilshere while Oxlade-Chamberlain is interesting Manchester United in what could represent another part of a major shake-up. \nArsenal could need a new midfield general while Aaron Ramsey could be sacrificed with Everton’s Ross Barkley also on the list of potential targets.
