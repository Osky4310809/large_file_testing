By comparison, only slightly more than half of Clinton’s voters were in these states. \nMore: \nOnly 11 percent of marchers, by contrast, were in a key group of swing states — those that Obama won in 2008 or 2012 but which Clinton lost in 2016. (These states are Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana.) Some 25 percent of tea party protesters on April 15, 2009, were in these swing states, by contrast. \nWhat does this mean? \nIt means that most of the women in the march the women are still for Clinton and anti-Trump. \nAlso that other women in red states and swing state did not in the main come out for the anti-Trump fest. \nIt wasn’t a “Women’s March” as much as it was a Democratic Coalition march.
