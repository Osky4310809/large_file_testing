No-one in Chelsea blue was publicly questioning his loyalty.

Gary Cahill jumps to head past Eldin Jakupovic (Photo: AFP/Getty) PLAYER RATINGS \nCourtois 7 - Safe as houses: bricks, mortar, chimney stack and the garden path. \nAzpilicueta 7 - Tidier than Alan Titchmarsh's garden, his versatility is such an asset. \nLuiz 7 - Took no prisoners, especially Clucas in one uncompromising collision. \nCahill 8 – MOM Early crack on the head then popped up unmarked to make it 2-0. \nMoses 7 - Fast and direct, his incisive cut-back broke Hull's resistance. \nKante 6 - Booked. Swapped relegation battle at Leicester for another title charge: good decision. Hull City line up to defend a free kick (Photo: PA) \nMatic 7 - Classier than tea at the Ritz, tougher than a marble staircase. \nAlonso 6 - Classier than dinner at the Savoy but lucky not to concede penalty. \nPedro 5 - Not quite at the races, like a non-runner in the 2.30 at Haydock. \nHazard 7 - Span away from defenders like a tumble dryer before injury took its toll. \nCosta 7 - All sins forgiven, it had to be him who broke the deadlock. \nSUBS: Willian (Pedro, 71) 6, Fabregas (Hazard, 71) 6, Batshuayi (Costa, 86). Eden Hazard in action with David Meyler (Photo: REUTERS) \nHULL CITY \nJakupovic 6 - Strange but true: for long periods he was the quieter keeper. \nElabdellaoui 7 - Decent debut from Norwegian wing-back, mobile and positive. \nMaguire 8 – Believe it or not, Hull's most threatening player when he rampaged forward. \nDavies 6 - Booked. Resolute, robust and lucky not be sent off in first-half stoppage time. \nDawson 6 - Booked. Immense in the air but only lost Costa once and it proved costly. Curtis Davies talks to referee Neil Swarbrick   \nRobertson 6 - Booked. Had his hands full keeping Moses on a short leash. \nMason 6 - Carried off after sickening clash of heads with Cahill. Get well soon. \nHuddlestone 6 - Just wide from early sighter, roamed middle of park diligently. \nClucas 6 - All over the place, like Rod Stewart doing the Scottish Cup draw. Ryan Mason was taken off with a head injury   \nEvandro 5 - Foraged and ferreted for space between the lines but space was limited. \nHernandez 6 - Chopped down by Alonso, another huge penalty call favours the 'big' club. \nSUBS: Meyler (Mason, 21) 6, Niasse (Davies, 60) 4, Diomande (Hernandez, 75) 5. \nREFEREE: Neil Swarbrick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T20:56:57.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
