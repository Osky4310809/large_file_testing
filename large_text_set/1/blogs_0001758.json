She opened the Calvin Klein show and appeared in its CK One ads; walked runways for Prada , John Galliano , and Vivienne Westwood ; and made international headlines for her just-started relationship with Johnny Depp. She also received a piece of fan mail from a young girl in Hereford, England, named Fiona, asking about Moss’s modeling career and wondering about the legitimacy of her relationship with Depp. The girl signed the letter, “please write back to me soon,” but unfortunately for Fiona, Moss never responded. Well, until now. \nA post from Moss’s new modeling agency, Kate Moss Agency, showed the letter from Fiona with a caption promising the now-woman a signed copy of her book. “Sorry about the wait,” reads the Instagram post. At this point, we think Fiona probably doesn’t mind. Those who might are the hundreds of commenters who are now looking for their own signed Moss paraphernalia. It might be worth taking a tip from Fi and sending off some snail mail to Moss. Even if it takes her 23 years to write back, it’ll be worth it.
