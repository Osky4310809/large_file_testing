Beck was very critical of the ridiculous “alternative facts” line and Trump’s fixation on crowd size and the numbers, but he also said Todd missed an opportunity to issue a mea culpa . \nBeck argued that if the press wants to regain some of the credibility it has lost, people like Todd need to start owning up to their oversights going back the last eight years. \nRELATED: Obama Advisor Openly Brags About Lying to Public, Media Yawns \nHe thinks the press needs to keep saying they made those mistakes over and over in order to get people to start trusting them again. \nLater in his show, Beck cited specific examples of lies and falsehoods from President Obama , most notably the president’s claim that in some communities it’s easier for teens to get their hands on Glocks than on computers and books. (This claim got a “Mostly False” rating from PolitiFact.) \nBeck made the point that any false statement of Trump’s sets off the press, but comments like the above from Obama and his administration didn’t get close to that kind of reaction. \nHe added that if any conservative dared make a statement close to what Madonna said about blowing up the White House , the media reaction would have been very different. \nListen to both segments above, via The Glenn Beck Program . \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:49:11.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
