With two rear cameras and an accessory slot that allowed you to modify the hardware, it was a phone that really thought outside the box. \nBut while these extras were great, it didn't nail all the basics and failed to sell well, so there's plenty of room for improvement for the LG G6. \nRumors for what LG is planning on its next flagship phone are growing steadily - here's everything we know so far about the LG G6. Cut to the chase What is it? The next flagship phone from LG When's it out? Launch on February 26 at MWC 2017 What will it cost? Likely around £490/$600/AU$820 SIM free LG G6 release date LG G6 announcement set for February 26 LG G6 release date rumored for April 7 LG G6 rumored specs \nDimensions : 148.8 x 72.3 x 8.3mm OS : Android 7 Nougat Screen size : 5.7-inch with 18:9 aspect ratio Resolution : 1440 x 2560 - Wireless charging - Headphone jack \nThe LG G6 announcement date is now confirmed as being February 26, as the company's press conference is scheduled for noon in Barcelona. \nOn the initial invite LG spelled out the time and date without mentioning the new phone, but it did frame the invite in a hint-driven 18:9 aspect ratio – the same as the rumored LG G6 extra-wide screen. \nFurthermore, a YouTube video direct from LG confirmed it will be launching in February 2017. The video doesn't confirm it's the LG G6 either, but since then LG has expanded on its initial invite with a new one , including the LG G6 name. \nAs for when we'll the phone on store shelves, LG said the G6 is launching \"in the very near future,\" and while that's the closest thing to an official date we have, there are rumors that it will arrive on US carriers on April 7 - almost a month after the apparent March 9 launch in South Korea. \nA report from \"industry insiders\" also suggests the company wants to release the LG G6 closer to the announcement date and will push to get the phone on sale in late February or early March. \nThere's no news on when the LG G6 will land in the UK or Australia, but it's likely to be around the same time as the US, so for now April 7 is our best guess. LG G6 design A glass or metal body No modules \nLG G6 leaks hint at a more stylish look and solid build quality than we've seen from LG's previous phone. An anonymous source told Korean site ChosunBiz LG will be using a tempered glass back on the new flagship. \nThat contrasts with the LG G5, which had a painted aluminum body that some didn't like. Being glass, it may not be as durable as a full-metal jacket would be, but that may be the price we pay for a better looking phone from LG. \nThen again, LG might not be moving away from metal after all, with another source claiming the G6 will have \"a highly reflective metallic material on the rear.\" \nWe've since seen a leaked image of the back, and that description neatly fits it - though it's not entirely clear from the image whether the material is glass or metal. \nThis image lines up with previously leaked renders from @OnLeaks that are supposedly based on an official factory CAD. \nThe render leak adds that the dimensions are apparently be 148.8 x 72.3 x 8.3mm, which would make it a similar size to the LG G5, but marginally thicker. \nAnother leaked image of the back (below) gives us a clearer look at the material, suggesting that brushed metal is in, and the rumored glass is out - assuming the shot is accurate. \nWe've also seen the apparent front of the LG G6 in a leaked photo, which you'll find below in the display section, and it shows a near bezel-less screen. \nWhatever design the G6 gets, the focus according to LG is on \"aesthetics and usability.\" \nThe interchangeable modules - or what LG calls \"friends\" - are out by the sounds of things, with LG's chief technologist Skott Ahn saying that LG is moving away from modular designs . \nIt's a decision we've been expecting, with an earlier report from the Electronic Times in Korea saying the same thing, while another source claimed the decision had been made in order to make the LG G6 waterproof. \nLG's first teaser video for the G6 features the word waterproof, so we can expect this to be the first phone from LG to feature a water tight design. \nTechRadar's take: LG is sure to be putting a lot of focus on the design of the G6, so expect something shiny and stylish. LG G6 display Large, 5.7-inch Quad HD display Minimal bezels around the screen An ultra-wide 18:9 aspect ratio \nThere aren't too many mysteries surrounding the LG G6's screen, as LG Display itself has said that the company's next smartphone (believed to be the G6) will have a 5.7-inch QHD LCD display. \nThey add that it has an 18:9 aspect ratio, so it's longer than most screens, which makes it ideal for split-screen apps. \nWe've seen the top half of this display in a recent LG G6 photo leak , which backs up claims that it'll have a 90% screen-to-body ratio with minimal bezel. \nAnother leak of a prototype adds extra evidence the LG G6 will be slimming down the bezel further than ever before, as well as including chamfered edges. Credit: Droid Life \nDubbed QHD+, this screen is 1440 x 2880, for a pixel density of 564 pixels per inch. It's also apparently 30% less power hungry than the previous generation of LG QHD displays, as well as having smaller bezels, better touch performance, and being easier to view in direct sunlight. \nThat would make for a big change from the 5.3-inch QHD screen in the LG G5, but then changing things up is no bad thing. \nHowever, it's not 100% confirmed that this screen is coming to the G6, and it's at odds with earlier rumors, including one which suggested LG is looking to make an OLED panel for its smartphones in the future, and maybe even curved ones. \nLG already produces OLED displays for TVs as well as the Apple Watch Series 2 , so it would make sense if the company installed one on the G6 - but it looks like it won't be ready in time. \nAnother earlier leak, this time from Gear India , which includes renders of the phone, states the LG G6 will have a 5.3-inch QHD display, just like the LG G5. \nTechRadar's take: A 5.7-inch QHD screen has been all but confirmed, so that's what we expect to see. LG G6 camera and battery \nHottest leaks: A removable battery Heat pipes to keep the battery cool \nThere aren’t any camera rumors yet, other than leaked renders which show a dual-lens snapper, just like the LG G5. Expect to see a return of both standard and wide-angle lenses, but likely with improvements – perhaps a higher megapixel count or greater optical zoom. \nThe main thing we've heard about the battery is that it may be removable , but not everyone agrees. \nIt shouldn't be in any danger of overheating though, as LG has confirmed that it's using heat pipes to pull heat away from the battery and other core components, as well as putting the battery through rigorous tests to ensure its safety. LG G6 OS and power Powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 chipset This chip is at heart of the Google Pixel, OnePlus 3T \nThe LG G6 specs call for a powerful Snapdragon 821 chipset, which also appears inside the Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL and OnePlus 3T. \nIt's plenty powerful and capable of running Google Daydream View VR games, but it's soon to be dethroned by the better-equipped Snapdragon 835 chipset. \nWhy not go with the absolute best chip? Samsung is manufacturing Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 and likely hogged the first 10nm chips for the Galaxy S8 . \nA minimum of 4GB of RAM is sure to be included too, as the LG G5 has that much, but a boost is likely, given that already some phones have 6GB.
