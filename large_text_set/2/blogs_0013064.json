NBC reports that Ford, who has a pilot’s license and was flying his own plane was reportedly landing when it flew over a Boeing 737 American Airlines flight that was about to take off for Dallas, carrying 110 passengers. \nAccording to NBC, Ford was told to land on a runway but seems to have mistaken the runway for a taxiway. After he landed, he reportedly asked, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” Air traffic control then told him he landed in the wrong place. Landing on the taxiway as opposed to a runway is an FAA safety violation and as a result, Ford is being investigated. At worst, he could lose his pilot’s license. \nThough Ford is an experienced flier, this is not his first scary experience. In 2015, he was injured when he crashed his plane into a golf course. \n[Helga Esteb / Shutterstock, Inc.] \nHave a tip we should know?
