For an actor, their debut film is that major make it or break it situation, and many celebrities rise to fame thanks to that one movie that really resonates with audiences. Often though, a lot of these debutants end up being one-hit movie wonders, sadly, as they never manage to crack a second film. Here are some actors who met that fate in Bollywood. Rajat Barmecha \nRajat stole the show with his debut film Udaan . The movie was about a boy who, after being expelled from his boarding school, returned to his abusive father, played by Ronit Roy. Rajat did a brilliant job as the teenager, who turns his rage into passion to teach his father a lesson. Post the movie, Rajat did several short films and web series but none of it led to any more films. We wish to see more of this powerhouse of talent. Sneha Ullal \nShe became famous overnight through the song Aake Bharlo Bajuo Mein from the movie Lucky: No Time For Love . Sneha was introduced by Salman Khan and her resemblance to actress Aishwarya Rai made her the talk of town. Sneha did a couple of movies post Lucky , but none helped her acting career. She is still remembered Aishwarya's lookalike. Gayatri Joshi \nWe still wonder why Gayatri quit acting, right after making her debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan, in the movie Swades . Gayatri was a familiar face as she had modeled for many brands. So, when she signed Swades , we had high expectations from her. The movie didn't do well at the box-office but Gayatri was critically acclaimed for her acting. She also won Star Screen Award and Zee Cine Award as best debutant. The same year, Gayatri got married to Vikas Oberoi and big goodbye to Bollywood. Bhagyashree \nShe made her debut along with superstar Salman Khan in Maine Pyaar Kiya . She won Filmfare Best Female Debut Award. Post Maine Pyar Kiya , Bhagyashree did several films but none got her in the limelight and she faded away. Bhumika Chawla \nOf course, you know her from the movie Tere Naam . Well, that's it. The girl did a couple of Bollywood films here and there but none worked for her career. Lately, she was seen in the movie M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story . Bhumika is still remembered as the Tere Naam actress. Rajeev Khandelwal \nAfter being the face of Indian television for years, Rajeev tried his hand in Bollywood and he succeeded. His film debut Aamir did good business and he was seen as the next big thing in Bollywood. But this success was short-lived. Rajeev did a couple of movies but none of them worked for his Bollywood acting career.
