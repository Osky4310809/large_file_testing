Tom Price (Ga.), was confirmed by the Senate. At the time, Trump promised Obamacare would be simultaneously repealed and replaced. \n“We’re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,” he said during a press conference last month. \nThe move to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time was spearheaded by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul last month, who warned about the consequences that repealing the law — and not immediately replacing it — would have on Americans, insurance companies, in addition to the political ramifications it could have on Republicans. \nSince then, talk of repealing and replacing Obamacare has become almost nonexistent, pushed aside by Trump’s many executive orders. \nSo far, only one of Trump’s executive orders has targeted Obamacare. His first executive order, signed on Inauguration Day , sought to begin unraveling the complicated regulations of Obamacare, which many saw as the first step of uprooting the law. \nStill, according to Bloomberg , the House Energy and Commerce Committee examined four draft bills last week “that could serve as a basis for some of the earliest moves by Republicans to replace pieces of the law.” \nListen to Trump’s comment below.
