She wrapped a light jacket around her body — clad in Lululemon workout pants and an Under Armour shirt — in an attempt to create warmth. \n“I was crazy shivering, uncontrollably, the whole night, it was absolutely freezing,” she says. “At some point, I thought I was going to die. At first, I was crying, but during the night I didn’t cry at all, I was just trying to stay positive.” \nA devotee of yoga and mindfulness meditation, Griffin tried to calm down with deep breathing and stretches, and focusing on her good fortune that at least she was alive. \nGriffin either hallucinated or dreamed — she isn’t sure — that Santos was with her through the night. “She was there talking to me,” says Griffin. “She said, ‘It’s OK, you can’t think you are going to die.'” \nAt the crack of dawn, Griffin decided to swim the short distance from the tree to the shore. As soon as she got back in the frigid water, the current whisked her into a patch of vines that caught onto her neck and stomach and pulled her beneath the water. “I thought I was going to die,” she says. \nGriffin, who considers herself a bad swimmer, serendipitously thought she could escape the vines by diving beneath them. “It was crazy for the idea to come,” she says. “It seemed like something divine, like God.” Jenna Santos Courtesy Monica Keyser \nIt worked. Now freed, the current swept her to an embankment in the stream; from there she made it to the nearby shore. \n“I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t move,” Griffin says. “I could barely stand and at one point I fell and said, ‘I can’t do it.'” \nBut she did, crawling up a small hill covered in berry bushes to the roadside. \n“I was so relieved, so happy, it was the happiest day of my life, I was waving my arms and the first truck I saw stopped,” she says. The driver put her in the truck and turned on the heater. “I told him I am so cold,” she says, “the coldest I’ve ever been.” \nThe trucker called 911, and let Griffin use his phone to call her family. An ambulance transported her to a nearby hospital, and Griffin was told her body temperature was 90 degrees. She also had a sprained ankle from the crash. \nBy that night, Griffin was home with her family, elated about her survival. The next day, however, and all the days since, the pain of Santos’ loss has been devastating. “I couldn’t stop crying for the last couple of days,” Griffin says. “This girl, who is like a sister to me, is just gone. It’s overwhelming and very sad.” Jenna Santos \nSantos was an only child, raised by a single mom without much financial means, says Griffin, a sophomore at a junior college. Santos attended Humboldt State and was working on transferring to UC-Berkeley to pursue a career in psychology. \n“She was always positive, she always found the good in people, she always wanted to make someone feel better, one of those people always bubbly,” says Griffin, whose family has set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for Santos’s funeral costs. Says Griffin: “We want to do all we can to help them.” \nThe crash is under investigation, a dispatcher with the California Highway Patrol tells PEOPLE.
