We’re here to tell you that that is A-OKAY! While many of your loved ones are likely out inhaling chicken wings and watching what seems like a never-ending game, you have every right to curl up with a different kind of entertainment (maybe something with fewer head-butts). Also, you have every right to inhale wings while watching a rom-com— skipping the game doesn’t mean skipping out on all the festivities, duh!\nHere’s what’s on Netflix now that’s definitely worth watching:\n1. Superbad \nvia GIPHY \nDitch the Super Bowl and watch Superbad ! What better way to honor a sport that’s centered testosterone-fueled aggression than watching a movie that focuses on the pressures that young guys face to assert their masculinity to the world? Plus, it’s really funny, and if you don’t feel like thinking about the limitations and problems that assigned our culture’s gender roles promote, you can just sit back and laugh at McLovin.\n2. 13th www.youtube.com Ava DuVernay’s documentary explores the U.S.’s history of disproportionately filling prisons with African-American men. It’s intense and thought-provoking, even blood-boiling, but so very important. Also, there’s now a follow-up interview with DuVernay and Oprah that you won’t want to miss, so add that to your queue.\n\nvia GIPHY \n3. Santa Clarita Diet \nDrew Barrymore stars in this brand new Netflix series about a suburban family whose lives take shocking turns when Barrymore’s character has to adhere to a special diet. And by special, we mean zombie. Check it out you can probably get through almost half a season in the time it takes for the Super Bowl to reach its halftime.\n4. Finding Dory \nIn case you haven’t already watched it ten (thousand) times, this Sunday afternoon is the perfect time to watch Finding Dory . You’ll be so glad that you did, because it’s seriously amazing and seriously not football.\n5. The Crown \nThis show offers the perfect escape on this fine Sunday afternoon to a time and place where football doesn’t even exist! Claire Foy won a SAG award for her performance and once you watch, you won’t wonder why.\n6. Ocean’s Twelve \nMissing The Big Game™ doesn’t have to mean missing out on watching a bunch of attractive men working together. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the modern-day Rat Pack (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, and more). Since the all-women’s Ocean’s Eight isn’t out yet, we’ll have to rely on these guys to quell our cravings for heist-flicks for now.\n7. Ali Wong: Baby Cobra \nIf you’re in need of some girl-power and good laughs, Ali Wong’s Netflix special is for you. Wong’s unapologetic delivery will make you feel A-okay that you are skipping the day’s main event for many and doing what makes YOU happy.\n8. American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson \nIt’s not quite football but it is about a famous football player so really you’re still kind of involved. The 10 episodes make up a fascinating look into the murder trial that has had a lasting impact and it’s definitely of great cultural importance.\nHappy Super Bowl Sunday!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:38:19.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
