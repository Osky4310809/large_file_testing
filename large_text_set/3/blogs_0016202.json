Covering the years 1965 to 1969, The Best of the Irish Rovers presents the heyday of a band that could be seen as an Irish analogue to Peter, Paul & Mary. They incorporated country (“Whiskey On A Sunday”), pop (the Herman Hermits-esque “Mrs. Crandall’s Boarding House”), and soft rock (“Years May Come, Years May Go”) into their vision of traditional Irish folk music. Despite its AOR tendencies the band could drum up convincing performances of rousing traditional ballads like “The Orange and the Green” and “Nancy Whiskey.” But its real talent was for producing gentle Irish-tinged story songs, including their definitive Shel Silverstein-penned hit “The Unicorn.” They may not have been the most authentic Irish band of all time (they hailed from Calgary, after all), but their music served as an Irish primer for the boomer generation and their songs are St. Patrick’s Day favorites to this day. Customer Reviews by joesardone Just one of the best collections of Irish drinking songs, and jig's I've ever seen. And for six dollars, just a great buy in general. These guys have a way of recording that just makes the listening experience worth twice the price. You feel a part of the music, which is great for parties or just a few of the guys drinking some whisky/ guinness over a game of cards or the game/ race. Brought back memories of St. Paddy's Day in Boston. by Jtixtlan If you are over 30 and any part Irish, your parents may have played their Irish Rovers album a lot around St. Paddy's Day. This will bring back memories. This CD includes many sing-along standby songs. And the lovliest of all was the Unicorn! I plan to use this downloaded CD to introduce my own kids to some Irish tunes. great", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T03:55:05.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
