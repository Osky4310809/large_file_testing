He is very drunk and we are dropping him home. He does not know what number…he lives on’\nAnd when friends on the group were unsure as to whether the contact was genuine, an officer even posted a selfie of himself to the group to prove who they were.\nCameron’s friend Lawrence Court, 20, a member of the group said he was ‘surprised’ to have received the message from the police.\n(Picture: Lawrence Court) (Picture: Lawrence Court) The human geography student said: ‘Initially I thought it was all a load of rubbish as it’s not something you’d expect a police officer to do.\n‘We called him out and the officer sent a selfie.’\nMan jailed after he swallowed gold necklace to avoid getting caught After being told the correct address, the officers messaged: ‘We will get him home safe now. Don’t forget to thank your friendly neighbourhood officers at Cathays station’\nLawrence added: ‘It made us all laugh out loud and the fact it has gone viral online is unbelievable.\n‘(Ron) actually can’t remember anything, he’s laughing about it now but I have tried to get something out of him but he actually doesn’t know.\n‘I think it’s brilliant, it gives you another side to the police force and you don’t often see them as being a laugh.\n‘Ron is going to get a lot of banter over this, no doubt. It’s one for the grandkids.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T08:45:57.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
