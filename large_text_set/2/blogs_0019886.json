As we've established earlier, Mondays are a bit of a pain. But in our minds, we think that if we look our best on a Monday, we might even end up feeling better not just on the first day of the week, but the whole week itself. So, here are five tips to try out on a Sunday, to ensure you look better every Monday morning. Get more sleep \nWe've always said that getting enough sleep is vital to looking and feeling your best. And sleeping well on a Sunday night sort of sets the tone for the rest of your week, so make sure you get enough zzzzss. Plan your day accordingly, if you can. Take care of your skin \nThis doesn't mean you have to visit a beautician or a salon. You can try a DIY facial, slip on a sheet mask, or even exfoliate to clear out your skin and look flawless on Monday. Get your blood flowing \nWhether you get in a workout, meditation, or a dance sesh, make sure you get your heart pumping on Sunday. This increases blood and oxygen flow in your body, and not only makes you feel better, but also makes your skin glow. Set aside your whole Monday look \nWaking up on a Monday morning is a pain in itself, and add to that the task of choosing your clothes, shoes and make-up can be even more annoying. So, use your Sunday to set aside your Monday outfit, right down to the shoes and make-up you want to wear. That way, you will have more time to get ready, or do something else if you want to, in the morning. Give your hair some TLC \nSet aside some time on Sunday to give your hair some extra loving, either using a mask or applying some oil. And if you're not planning to wash your hair on Monday, spray on some dry shampoo on Sunday night itself, so it absorbs well, and you get that perfect messy hair the next morning.
