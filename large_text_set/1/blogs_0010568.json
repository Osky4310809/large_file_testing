The network says the problem was likely a routing issue, since RT is one of the networks that C-SPAN regularly monitors. \nSpokesman Howard Mortman says C-SPAN’s website was replaced by RT for about 10 minutes. He says the network is “investigating and troubleshooting this occurrence.” \n“This afternoon the online feed for C-SPAN was briefly interrupted by RT programming. We are currently investigating and troubleshooting this occurrence,” the network said in a statement on Twitter. “As RT is one of the networks we regularly monitor, we are operating under the assumption that it was an internal routing issue. If that changes we will certainly let you know.” \n— CSPAN (@cspan) January 12, 2017 \nThe programming glitch came hours after a power outage interrupted a Senate confirmation hearing for Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA. The hearing reconvened in a different room. \nThe Architect of the Capitol’s office says a local power company “de-energized” a system that feeds power to the Hart Senate Office Building. The office says the company, Pepco, quickly restored the lost power. \n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
