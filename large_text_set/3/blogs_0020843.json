Here’s even more, in the guise of Scarlett Johansson’s Major majorly beating down a suspect while camouflaged then not camouflaged because, come in, if you have Scarlett Johansson in your movie you don’t keep her off screen for long.\n\n\nAnd if you’re wondering how they made that suit she’s wearing, Paramount also released a featurette about only that:\n\nThey also debuted a featurette about Section 9, the task force the Major is leading:\n\nAnd a featurette about the art of the film:\n\nAnd now, Scarlett Johansson asks, “How many fingers am I holding up?”\n\n\nAnd finally, Paramount released a promo and poster for Michael Pitt’s villain, Kuze, whom director Rupert Sanders has described as an amalgamation of more than one villain (we’re guessing The Puppeteer and The Laughing Man ).\n\nParamount\nI wonder if fridge magnets stick to him.\n(Via Paramount , CBM , We Got This Covered , and Paramount UK )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:01:15.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
