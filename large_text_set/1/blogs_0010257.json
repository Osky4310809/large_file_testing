We're happy to see that it's still perpetually foggy, the woods are still ominous , and Kyle MacLachlan/FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper hasn't aged a single day. \nThe short trailer for Showtime's Twin Peaks revival, which the company's CEO, David Nevins, has described as \"pure heroin David Lynch,\" is finally here. \n\"I see it as a film,\" Lynch said at TCA this year . \"And a film in parts is what people will experience. It was a joyful experience. This word 'expect' is a magical word. People expect things, and their expectations are hopefully met when they see the thing.\" \nOr, in the words of Log Lady, \"One day my log will have something to say about this.\" \nThe 18-episode revival will have its two-hour premiere on Showtime on May 21. Immediately thereafter, the next two episodes will be available online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T01:05:13.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
