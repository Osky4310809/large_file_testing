Airport security has been increased Monday after four men were taken into custody by the National Bureau of Investigation agents at the parking lot of the NAIA Terminal 3 hours earlier. AP/Bullit Marquez \nMANILA, Philippines —The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Sunday asked netizens to stop sharing or reposting an alleged document purportedly warning of a bombing attempt of a shopping mall. \n”We request that netizens should stop sharing or reposting the document. As of now, there is no evidence or information gathered that would confirm the content of the report,” National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief Director Oscar Albayalde said in an official statement. \nAlbayalde was referring to a picture of a PNP memorandum which circulated online, ordering an intensified intelligence gathering and conduct of risk assessment in response to information claiming that the Abu Sayyaf Group is threatening to bomb SM malls. \nThe memorandum with subject \"Intensification of Intelligence Gathering and Conduct of Risk Assessment\" bore Senior Superintendent Vicente Danao Jr.'s name and signature. It was dated Feb. 3, 2017. \nHowever, Albayalde said, like any other report that they receive, the PNP is not taking the information for granted. \n”We have strengthened our target hardening measures in all fronts down to the police precinct level,” he said.   \nThe NCRPO chief assured that they maintain their full alert status to ensure the accounting and maximum presence of their policemen in the streets and places of convergence, particularly malls. \n”The public has nothing to fear, while we request the public to remain calm we ask them to remain vigilant and observant,” Albayalde said. \nThe PNP official also urged the public to report any suspicious activity to the nearest police station or to any policeman on sight so that they can act immediately and appropriately. — PNA with a report from Philstar.com/Rosette Adel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:42:41.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
