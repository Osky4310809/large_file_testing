The Trump administration has been restricting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) from posting on social media and talking to reporters. Now it seems that at least the USDA has returned some of their outreach capabilities. \nThere was an initial report that the USDA had to stop releasing “news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds, and social media content.” But this is no longer the case as the original order is “hereby rescinded.” \nThis may seem like a minor victory given how dark things appear right now. However, I think it is very good news because not only can USDA scientists continue to share their work with the public, it’s an example that public outcry works under Trump. If we keep fighting and keep resisting, we can survive these four years.
