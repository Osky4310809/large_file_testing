According to some folks who got the Switch Pro Controller early, the peripheral will pretty much just plug-and-play on the PC. Redditor CalKnight was one of the first to discover this, and posted a video of himself trying it out by using the Dolphin GameCube emulator. \n\nThe Pro Controller connects via Bluetooth, so your computer will have to have the capability to detect wireless devices. Additionally, CalKnight says that there's a \"weird way\" to pair the device to the computer. He also mentioned that the controller works with Steam's Big Picture mode, though no footage of that was shown. CalKnight intends to release a followup video that will answer some frequently asked questions and go into detail on how to pair the controller.\nConfirmed: Pro Controller Works Natively With PC!
