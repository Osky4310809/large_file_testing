That it was Garcia who stood between him and the weekend was bittersweet. WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play: Articles, photos and videos \n“I'd rather not play a fellow Spaniard. Obviously, representing Spain, we want as many Spaniards to make it as far as possible,” Rahm said. “We're friends and we know it was going to be a great battle. We knew we were going to have fun.” \nRahm has just three bogeys this week and pulled away from Garcia on Friday with birdies at Nos. 9, 10 and 11 to finish group play undefeated.
