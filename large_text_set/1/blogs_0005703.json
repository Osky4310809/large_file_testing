For the next wave of dirt-cheap smartphones, Google hopes to see that price barrier dropping to $30.\nSEE ALSO: Sundar Pichai recollects college romance during visit to his Alma Mater\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said today that Android OEMs are currently offering smartphones for $100 and $50, but for emerging markets such as that of India’s, they need smartphones that cost $30.\n\"I think two big things, one is from our side — we are committed to making even cheaper smartphones. […] The right price point for smartphones in India is $30, and pursuing high quality smartphones at the price point will unlock it even more,\" Pichai said in a televised interview with NDTV.\n\"Hopefully, we can all push and make $30 smartphones happen,\" Pichai said in a separate interview. India has the largest user base of Android users. India has over 260 million smartphone users with most phones sold costing under $150 .\nBut getting cheaper smartphones, Pichai says, is only part of the puzzle. To get more Indians online, services need to work on \"flaky\" networks.\nGoogle’s YouTube Go app, for instance, offers download option for offline viewing, and works on slower networks as well. Pichai said the company is working on making more of its services adapt to the slower internet.\nIndia-born Pichai is visiting the country currently. On Wednesday, he announced Digital Unlocked initiative through which the company aims to bring all small and medium businesses to the internet. About 68 percent of such businesses don't have any online presence currently.\nBONUS: Cheap Smartphones Will Take a Majority of the Market by 2017", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9T6TrBjz.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9T6TrBjz.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-05T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:11:43.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
