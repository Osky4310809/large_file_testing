Aziz Ansari encourages Trump to make a speech denouncing racism To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nIn his monolog on the January 21 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” Aziz told viewers, \nI’m sure there’s a lot of people that voted for Trump the same way a lot of people listen to the music of Chris Brown, where it’s like, ‘Hey, man! I’m just here for the tunes… I don’t know about that other stuff. I just like the dancing and the music. I don’t condone the extracurriculars. \nIf you think about it, Donald Trump is basically the Chris Brown of politics, and ‘Make America Great Again’ is his ‘these hoes ain’t loyal.’ \nBeautiful. Brilliant. Hilarious. \nIn the spirit of a 3 am Trump Twitter storm , Chris jumped on Instagram with a since-deleted video criticizing Aziz for the comparison. \nHe said, \nI can’t fucking catch a break. This nigga said, ‘Donald Trump is the Chris Brown of politics.’ I swear I’m getting the fuck out of here. Don’t fucking trust what you see. Even salt look like sugar. \nWhen The Shade Room shared a clip of Aziz’s bit on Instagram, Chris reposted it, called the comedian “Aladdin” and told him to “hop off my dick.” \nPrior to the singer’s reaction, the comparisons to Trump lacked that special racist quality The Donald has cultivated as a cornerstone of his persona. \nChris’s choice to drag Aziz based on his heritage (his family is from Tamil Nadu, India) only serves to make the “Master of None” star’s joke hit harder in retrospect. \nTL;DR: Aziz Ansari is still hilarious and Chris Brown is still a bucket of dog barf. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
