The clip opens with Perry dressed in her best 1950s science-fiction outfit, as she enjoys the rollercoaster and apparent joy of the amusement park. However, it quickly becomes clear that things aren’t what they seem, with the video making references to the failing of the American Dream, clean water, bombs, and the nuclear family.\nLater, Perry comes to realize that the utopia of the amusement park is in fact a dystopia, as she becomes “woke” to the monotony that’s causing the end of western civilization as we know it.\nWatch the video for “Chained To The Rhythm” below.\nHeavy stuff, we think you’ll agree.\nMeanwhile, Katy Perry’s “Chained To The Rhythm” recently broke Spotify’s record for the most first-day streams in one day by a female artist notching up a collective 3,062,293 plays.\n“Chained To The Rhythm” is available now, and is taken from Katy Perry’s yet-to-be-titled fourth album, which is expected for release later this year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:10:52.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
