Staff photo by Angela Rowlings comments Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo today defended a move to hike his pay by 50 percent and that of dozens of other legislators as \"long overdue,\" as he and the Legislature prepare to move quickly to push through the package and its $6.5 million price tag.\nDeLeo, speaking after a Democratic caucus where at one point lawmakers could be heard through the door clapping, said that there's never a good time to vote on pay raises, including for himself.\nBut he said he's long heard from other lawmakers and even constitutional officers about a need to raise their salaries, even at a time when Gov. Charlie Baker recently made nearly $100 million in budget cuts.\n\"This is something that has been long overdue,\" said DeLeo, whose pay would increase from roughly $97,500, before expenses, to $142,500 under the bill, which could go to the House for a vote as early as tomorrow -- the same day Baker is expected to release his budget proposal.\nEmerging from the caucus with other Democratic reps, DeLeo said the mood in the first-floor hearing room was \"very good.\"\n\"I think I heard more than a couple of jokes,\" DeLeo said, without elaborating. \"I think the mood was understanding, I think the mood was appreciative.\"\nHe also indicated he wasn't concerned with a wave of blow-back from constituents.\n\"Anytime you make any decision, I think whether it's this, whether it was with the gun legislation which I filed, even with domestic violence (legislation), whether it was transgender (rights), there's always someone out there who is going to disagree. That's part of the job,\" the Winthrop Democrat said.\nState Rep. Brian Dempsey, chair of the House's committee on ways and means, said the package would cost $6.5 million this fiscal year, with about $5 million of that covering a slew of $25,000 raises for the state's judges and clerk magistrates.\nOver the next full fiscal year, the hikes would cost between $12 million and $18 million, he said.\nThe share of the legislative pay hikes -- about $1.4 million this fiscal year, which ends June 30 -- will be covered by money that's already in its budget, Dempsey said.\nDeLeo and Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, who currently get $35,000 on top the lawmakers' base $62,500 salary, would instead earn an $80,000 stipend under the bill. The head of the House and Senate ways and means committees, meanwhile, who currently collect a $25,000 stipend for crafting the state budget, would instead pocket a $65,000 salary additive, pushing their pay to $127,500 a year.\nThe party's majority and minority leaders' salaries would rise to $122,500, thanks to a $60,000 stipend, which is more than double the $22,500 they currently get.\nIt would also give Gov. Charlie Baker, who currently makes $151,000, a raise to $185,000, plus he'd be entitled to $65,000 more in housing allowances. Each of the state's other constitutional officers would also get various pay raises between $165,000 and $175,000.\nBaker has not said whether he'd veto a bill with pay raises, but has said neither he nor Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito would personally take an increase.\nThe 18-page bill would also eliminate the Legislature's controversial per diem system, which awards lawmakers extra cash based on where they live and how often they drive to work in the State House.\nInstead, lawmakers who live within 50 miles would get $15,000 to cover expenses, while those who live 50 or more miles from Beacon Hill would get $20,000, meaning the vast majority of rank-and-file lawmakers and leadership would make more money than they currently do even if they took per diems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:41:26.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
