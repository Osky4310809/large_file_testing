Anyone is welcome to visit, but your only way to be invited to stay is if you prove that you’ll work your absolute hardest, and leave no effort on the table in any workout. People who cut corners and half-ass their workouts are either invited to leave or exit on their own volition. \nWe do this to create a culture that breeds the hardest work humanly possible—when everyone else is pushing themselves, you’ll push yourself, too. And those who do stick around? Each and and every one of them becomes insanely, unhumanly fit. Advertisement \nPrivacy Policy | About Us \nThis culture of holding yourself to a higher standard has attracted everyone from pro athletes and actors, to special forces soldiers and average guys looking to become superhuman. \nOur workouts—and the workouts in my new Men’s Health book Maximus Body —include everything from heavy lifting days, to vicious circuits, to rowing challenges that will bury you. Each of these workouts tends to work your entire body, and our goal is elite fitness, the ability to do everything well—becoming totally ripped is just a consequence of that goal. \nYet, every now and then, one of these men or women slip up. Feeling a bit lazy, one of them will come in and ask, “Can we just do an easy abs day today?” \nDon’t tell me you want to do an “abs workout.” The truth is that when you train doing the exercises we do—functional exercises like front squats, ball slams, rowing, and more—your core is always activated. So, by default, any workout that you do is an abs workout. \nWhen I get that question, I have the person do this brutal abs workout. I call it: “Don’t Ask Me About Your Abs.” It surely isn’t easy, but it works. Your midsection will be sore for days—and you’ll be ripped as a result. \nIf you like this workout, there are 100 more in my book, Maximus Body , which gives you direct access to my black book of fitness knowledge, and training strategies that make you mentally tougher (I use these often with my Special Forces soldiers). If you, too, are after elite, truly life-changing fitness, you’ll find just how to achieve it in the book. \nDirections : Set a timer to go off every 30 seconds. \nDo the following exercises in the order shown for 30 seconds each. Rest 30 seconds between exercises, but do 5 pushups during each “rest” period. \nThat’s 1 round. Do 3 total rounds. \n1. Situp \nLie on your back on the floor. Bend your knees 90 degrees and place your feet flat on the floor. Now perform a classic situp by raising your torso into a sitting position. Lower it back to the start. \n2. Pushup position plank \nAssume a pushup position, your torso completely straight. Hold the position for time. \n3. V-sit kickout \nAssume a V-sit position, your butt on the ground, knees bent at your chest and feet just above the floor. Your arms should be at your side, with your hands just above the floor. Slowly straighten your legs and lower your torso. Pause when your legs are straight, your feet and upper back just a few inches above the floor. Reverse the movement and repeat. \n4. V-sit hold \nAssume a V-sit position, your butt on the ground, knees bent at your chest and feet just above the floor. Your arms should be at your side, with your hands just above the floor. Hold the position for time. \n5. Leg raise \nLie on your back with your hands at your sides. Raise your feet a few inches off the floor. This is the start. Keep your legs straight as you slowly raise them until they’re vertical. Slowly reverse the movement. That’s one rep. \n6. Leg raise hold \nLie on your back, your hands at your sides and body straight. Raise your feet a few inches off the floor. Hold the position for time. \n7. Toes to bar \nHang from a pullup bar with an overhand, shoulder-width grip. Now raise your legs, brining your feet to your hands. Maintain an upright torso (don’t swing forward). Pause, and lower your legs slowly to the starting position. \n8. Pushup position plank \nAssume a pushup position, your torso completely straight. Hold the position for time. \nFor more savage workouts like this, check out my new Men’s Health book Maximus Body !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:21:12.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
