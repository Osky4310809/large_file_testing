Restaurant Brands did not respond immediately to a request for comment, while Popeyes decline to comment.\nPopeyes afce , whose fans include pop singer Beyonc?, began 45 years ago as a Southern-fried “Chicken on the Run” restaurant in a New Orleans suburb. It has since expanded to more than 2,000 restaurants, of which 1,600 are in the United States.\nThe company has benefited from strong customer loyalty, as well as from a restaurant refurbishment program.\nChicken accounts for about 10% of the fast-food industry, according to data service IBISWorld, and Popeyes’ market share is growing. The largest brands in the sector include privately held Chick-fil-A and Yum! Brands’ KFC.\nPrivate equity firm 3G Capital, which is controlled by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, owns about 43% of the voting shares in Restaurant Brands rtbrf . 3G Capital has made a name by acquiring major U.S. consumer companies including Kraft Heinz.\nRestaurant Brands was formed in 2014, when 3G Capital-backed Burger King acquired Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc for $11 billion.\n3G Capital’s long-time partner, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway , committed $3 billion of preferred equity to finance that deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:11:31.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
