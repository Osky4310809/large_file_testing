Media caption Why was North Korea's Kim Jong-nam killed? \nMr Kim's body remains in a mortuary in Kuala Lumpur, amid a dispute over who should be entitled to claim it. \nMalaysia has said it will only hand the body over to immediate relatives who can provide a DNA sample. \nBut North Korea, which reacted furiously to Malaysia conducting a post-mortem examination, says it should be able to claim the body of one of its citizens. \nPyongyang has yet to confirm that the body was that of Mr Kim. He was travelling under a diplomatic passport under a different name at the time. \nMr Zahid said the rules requiring all North Koreans to secure visas to enter Malaysia would be effective from 6 March, the Bernama state news agency reports. \nDiplomatic ties between the two countries were initiated in the 1970s and as trade in resources such as palm oil and steel increased, North Korea eventually established an embassy in Kuala Lumpur in 2003. \nBut Mr Kim's death has converted this relationship into a full-blown diplomatic rift, with Malaysia even recalling its ambassador from Pyongyang.
