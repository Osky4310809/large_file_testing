Which offensive linemen free agents should Rams target in offseason? By Bryan Kalbrosky 5 hours ago 279 shares By: Bryan Kalbrosky | 5 hours ago \nMuch of the attention and money that the Los Angeles Rams need to spend this offseason is fixing their major problems at offensive line. \nThe Rams will have $40.9 million in cap room during the upcoming offseason ( via OverTheCap.com ). \nHere are the players we’ve targeted as the best fits for the Rams in free agency at offensive line. Related: Rams offensive lineman Greg Robinson is most penalized player in NFL Andrew Whitworth, LT \nThe Cincinnati Bengals offensive lineman signed a $9 million contract extension in 2015. While the 35-year-old left tackle is nearing the end of his career, he was the second-highest rated overall tackle in the NFL during the 2016 season. \nWhile he’d be a huge pickup for the Rams and is an unrestricted free agent, he says he wants to return to the Bengals ( via Cincinnati.com ). Andrew Whitworth & Domata Peko are the bedrock of the most successful #Bengals era. Is Sunday their end in stripes? https://t.co/83N4KwZ4m0 pic.twitter.com/KvTLRhyHHa \n— Paul Dehner Jr. (@pauldehnerjr) December 30, 2016 A.Q. Shipley, C \nThe Arizona center makes $785,000 per season but is due for a raise after an impressive year for the Cardinals. He was the No. 15 overall center this year according to Pro Football Focus. \nShipley is an unrestricted free agent and one of the top rush blockers in the NFL at his position after finally earning the starting gig. Arians said Evan Boehm could be the team's right guard next season, but could battle A.Q. Shipley for center job. BA wants Shipley back. \n— Jess Root (@senorjessroot) January 2, 2017 Andrew Norwell, LG \nNorwell was an undrafted free agent from Ohio State for the Carolina Panthers. He makes just $514,000 per season but he is a restricted free agent heading into the offseason. This year, he was one of the top guards in the NFL. \nAccording to Pro Football Focus, he was the fourth-best guard against the rush in 2016. Andrew Norwell is an intriguing RFA. Panthers may want to sign him to a LT deal because I'm betting he gets an offer they have to match. \n— Ben (@bengoodfella) January 2, 2017 Ronald Leary, LG \nThe Dallas Cowboys pay Leary $2.5 million per season and he is an unrestricted free agent heading into the offseason. His backup is former seventh-overall pick Jonathan Cooper, who was recently waived by the Denver Broncos. \nLeary is a top-ten rush blocker according to Pro Football Focus and would provide tremendous help for protecting Todd Gurley. My top '16 Ronald Leary clip. Best trait of Leary's on display; competitive toughness. Intense desire to finish his opponent. #DallasCowboys pic.twitter.com/SUloBOiVep \n— Brandon Thorn (@VeteranScout) January 6, 2017 J.C. Tretter, C \nDespite a gnarly injury that kept him out awhile for the Green Bay Packers this season, Tretter is one of the most valuable offensive linemen available in free agency. The former fourth-round pick makes just $643,000 per season. \nHe can play all positions on the line and can protect the rushing game and the passing game with equal efficiency. Starting to think JC Tretter may leave in free agency. With so many teams needing a good center, he should get some significant offers. \n— Michael Rodney (@PackersNotes) December 31, 2016 Others: \nKevin Zeitler (RG) — The Cincinnati Bengals offensive lineman is the highest-rated offensive guard available via free agency according to Pro Football Focus. \nPatrick Omameh (LG) — The Jaguars left guard is one of the top twenty pass blockers but is relatively inept in the run block, which is not good for Gurley. \nTy Nsekhe (LT) — The 6-foor-8 offensive lineman for Washington makes $550,000 per season and would be a nice addition to the Rams. \nTJ Lang (RG) — Only Baltimore Ravens offensive guard Marshal Yanda protects the pass better than Green Bay’s Lang. \nLarry Warford (RG) — He has started at right guard since he was drafted and seems willing to leave Detroit. But The Rams are solid at right guard. Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:42:49.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
