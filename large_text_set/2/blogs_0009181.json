Cagliari later had Nicolo Barella dismissed for fouling Miralem Pjanic. \nEarlier, Roma made sure to keep the pressure on Juve by beating Crotone 2-0 with goals from Radja Nainggolan and Edin Dzeko. \nThe Bosnian striker could have scored first but missed a 17th-minute penalty, meaning it fell to Nainggolan to give Roma the lead just before half-time.

Juve are seven points clear (Photo: REUTERS) \nIago Falque got the ball rolling with a second-minute opener at the Stadio Olimpico and Pescara looked doomed when Arlind Ajeti and Belotti added further goals before 15 minutes were up. \nAdem Ljajic extended Il Toro's advantage eight minutes after the break but, after Belotti grabbed his second on the hour, Ajeti put through his own net. \nVisiting midfielder Ahmad Benali, formerly of Manchester City, then narrowed the gap to three goals before frightening Torino with another goal for Pescara. \nRoberto Inglese plundered a hat-trick in Chievo's 3-1 win over 10-man Sassuolo in Reggio Emilia.
