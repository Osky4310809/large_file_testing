Located next to the iconic “ Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln ” in the Disneyland Opera House, Disneyana pays homage to the old-fashioned art galleries of Walt Disney’s youth. \nWhile this cosmopolitan shop has called Main Street, U.S.A., home for many years, in 2013 with the expansion of the Market House it relocated down the street to Town Square and into an elegant new space inside the Bank of Main Street building. \n\nFor the Disney memorabilia collector in your party, Disneyana is a must-see. This location offers a unique array of rare Disney collectables including limited-edition fine art, figurines and paintings. Here you’ll also find print-on-demand kiosks, ink and paint cels and artist sketches. Disneyana is often the spot of artist signings and specialty merchandise events .\n\nIn 2012, we stopped by to chat with Disney Sketch Artist David Mitchell at Disneyana’s previous location. Fast forward to 2016, and you can still find these highly-skilled and talented artists inside the current location, creating beautiful hand-drawn sketches of Disney characters. \n\nDid I mention just next door in the lobby of the Disneyland Opera House you’ll also find The Disney Gallery and The Disneyland Story exhibit? Next time you visit Disneyana, stop by and take a look at the seasonal exhibits and the amazing concept art and models created by Imagineers and Disney-inspired artists. \nWhat’s your favorite thing about Disneyana?
