The entire flight took place in the controlled airspace of the Palm Springs Airport. \nAmazon, UPS , Google and others are developing drone delivery technology, in hopes of bringing shipments faster and cheaper to customers. However, these companies still need to answer tough questions about the drones' safety and effectiveness before they can reach the public. \nAmazon's goal has been to ship items within 30 minutes, though for now is mostly testing its technology. Last year, it started a small pilot program for customers in the UK , but it's been limited in bringing autonomous drones to the US because of tight government restrictions.
