One particular item caught the eye of Mary Numair , a Portland, Oregon resident who saw it advertised on the storefront inside the Lloyd Center Shopping Mall: \n“In case anyone still needed a reason to never walk into a Spencer’s again, this is proudly being displayed in the front of their PDX store,” Numair writes. “Way to normalize sexual assault.” \nThe slogan “Grab America by the Pussy” is a reference to the infamous Access Hollywood tape where Trump was caught on a hot mic years ago as he bragged about his sexual conquests . \nNumair’s post was shared thousands of times over the weekend, and she has taken to Twitter to address the online abuse that she says has come her way: I had no idea how many fake right-winged propaganda twitter accounts there were until this Spencer's bull shit blew up. \n— Mary Numair (@MaryNumair) January 16, 2017 How many men get rape threats for calling out a problematic situation? For defending the basic safety of people? \n— Mary Numair (@MaryNumair) January 16, 2017 Should I accept all the recent fb requests from dudes with no mutual friends but they have hella American flags and guns in their photos? \n— Mary Numair (@MaryNumair) January 16, 2017 \nNumair told online commentators to make their disapproval known to Spencer’s management, though she said critics should refrain from berating employees. \nThe Oregonian reports that Lloyd Center general manger Bob Dye has received plenty of outraged messages about the shirt’s display. \n“This is wrong on so many levels,” Dye said. “Regardless of where on the political aisle you stand. We are as incensed at this as you are and we will do everything within the confines of the lease to have it removed.” \n[Image via Facebook]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T01:57:11.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
