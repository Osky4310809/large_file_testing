File photo \nMANILA, Philippines (UPDATED 12:24 p.m.) â€” House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez is set to file a bill that would abolish the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OCGG) and the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). \nThe House leadership is seeking to move the duties of the OCGG and the PCGG under the Office of the Solicitor General. \nAlvarez said that the OCGG, which advises government-owned firms, has no reason to continue its operations as it had never won a single case. \n\"Walang pinapanalong kaso, sa totoo lang. I have to be blunt about it,\" Alvarez said. \nAside from the two agencies, the House leader also wants to abolish the Presidential Legislative Liaison Office as its mandate to coordinate between the executive and the legislative branch is already being done by the Legislative Executive Development Advisory Council. \nREAD: Speaker wants wife, other lawmakers' spouses out of Batasan   \nAlvarez will also remove the office of the spouses of lawmakers or the Congressional Spouses Foundation as it is not covered by the duty of the House and the streamlining of bureaucracy. \nThe OCGG is the \"principal and statutory law office of government-owned-and-controlled corporations, their subsidiaries, government financial institutions, government corporate offspring, government instrumentalities with corporate powers and government acquired asset corporations,\" according to its website. \nOn the other hand, the PCGG was created to recover all ill-gotten wealth accumulated by ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates, cronies and dummies whether in the Philippines or abroad. \nCreating the PCGG was the first executive order that former President Corazon Aquino signed upon taking office in February 1986. \nAbout 30 years since its establishment, the PCGG has recovered a total of P170 billion in cash while working on an annual budget of about P110 million. \n\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect a more accurate PCCG annual budget of about P110 million. It earlier mistakenly cited an annual budget of P2.2 billion.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:55:40.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
