They might have played with creating apps before. But you don’t necessarily have to have that knowledge to enter the competition — you can just have a curiosity,” Cummings said. \nOne of last year’s top national finishers, Abington Junior High School’s Sofiya Lysenko, is running the workshops. \nCummings says there are few female role models as visible as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg for girls interested in computer science. \n“That’s what this whole program is about: bringing girls into the conversation and into the limelight,” she said. \nYou have to register before the 20th at projectcsgirls.com/register and at abingtonfreelibrary.org/teens .
