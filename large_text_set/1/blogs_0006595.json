They couldn’t say how many of the 800 sick calls may be traced to this virus. \nIt typically goes away within 24 to 48 hours; good hygiene is essential to keeping the virus at bay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:37:52.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
