She was not motivated by a desire to expose wrongdoing, for she ignored channels used by generations of whistleblowers and instead sought the wholesale exposure of ­government secrets.\nDiplomats are like journalists, doctors and lawyers: their jobs depend on the trust and confidentiality of those with whom they speak. As the US military engages increasingly in civil affairs, soldiers are not much different.\nManning not only burned the sources of hundreds of diplomats, but she effectively dissuaded foreigners from trusting any future American official.\nThe exposure may also have cost lives: Both al Qaeda and the Taliban combed through documents to identify those cooperating with the United States.\nWikiLeaks — the chief beneficiaries of Manning’s crime — didn’t care.\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange suggested those murdered as a result deserved their fate.\nJulian Assange AP “We are not obligated to protect other people’s sources,” he said, adding that Afghans “should know about” those who have engaged in “genuinely traitorous” acts, such as talking to the US military.\nJust as turning his back on the “no chemical weapons” red line in Syria convinced the Syrian government and other rogue regimes that they could massacre civilians without consequence, Obama’s willingness to free Manning will convince the disgruntled and unstable that they can betray the trust put in them.\nObama entered office promising to preside over the most transparent administration in US history but led its most opaque. Manning’s commutation does not change this legacy. Rather, it rationalizes treason and reflects Obama’s disdain both for the bureaucracy over which he presided and those who abided by its rules and placed meaning in their oaths.\nMichael Rubin, a former Pentagon official, is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:49:32.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
