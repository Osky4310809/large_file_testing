He cites concerns over privacy and conflicting business interests as the two factors that most influenced his decision. Advertisement \nAccording to the AP, Bilden released a statement via the Pentagon explaining that he was unable to fulfill the requirements set by the Office of Ethics without “undue disruption and materially adverse divestment of my family’s private financial interests.” \nAn intelligence officer in the Army Reserve from 1986 to 1996, Bilden brought global private equity firm HarbourVest Partners LLC to Hong Kong. He retired after 25 years. Advertisement \nUntil recently the Pentagon sought to squelch rumors that Bilden would withdraw. Now Defense Secretary Jim Mattis states that he will recommend a replacement to Trump in the next few days. \nVincent Viola, Trump’s selection for Army secretary, also withdrew due to business-related conflicts of interest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:50:35.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
