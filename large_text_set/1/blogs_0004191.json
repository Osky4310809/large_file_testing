Director Taika Waititi has already said that Thor 3 will be the more “out there” than any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films — which is saying quite a bit for a franchise that includes such “out there” stories as Ant-Man , Guardians of the Galaxy , Doctor Strange, and Age Of Ultron . The inclusion of Sakaar’s Imperial Arena and Hulk in his gladiator gear is proof enough that the MCU is still expanding. \nIn 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe started off with little more than billionaires and robotics in Iron Man . Since that time, the MCU has introduced superhuman serums (Captain America, Hulk), sorcerers and magic ( Doctor Strange ), space travel ( Guardians of the Galaxy ), freak-accident superheroes (Matt Murdock/Daredevil), god-like beings from Norse mythology (Thor), deals with the devil (Ghost Rider), talking animals (Rocket Raccoon, Howard the Duck) and a Microverse accessible by technology not unlike that found in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids . With the expansion of the MCU showing no signs of slowing down, doesn’t it seem likely that a race of vampires will eventually show up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? \nIn fact, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. all but confirmed the existence of Hellcow — which implies the existence of at least one vampire, namely, Dracula. In Marvel Comics, the only established character that Dracula ever runs into is The Incredible Hulk — who just happened to be under the influence of an Asgardian hammer, fresh from a battle with Thor. \nThe same story ( Hulk vs. Dracula , 2011) reveals that there’s been an entire race of vampires — several different sects, in fact — who have been living in hiding in Eastern Europe. The mere existence of vampires — especially after an encounter with someone like The Incredible Hulk — could easily make way for an introduction to Blade, Marvel’s most iconic vampire hunter. Hellcow \nBut the whole thing starts with Hellcow. If you use your Netflix subscription to go back and watch Season 2, Episode 5 of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , “A Hen in the Wolf House,” just shy of eight minutes in you’ll see Jemma Simmons reviewing something under a microscope while working undercover at Hydra. \n“What sort of Hellcow produces carmine milk?” \nThe response from Hydra agent Kenneth Turgeon confirms that it is, indeed, the same obscure Hellcow found in Marvel Comics . \n“I don’t know. The file just says ‘Bessie.'” \nThe only time Hellcow exists in Marvel Comics is in an issue of Man-Thing in which she battled Howard the Duck. Viewers who stuck around for the post-credits in Guardians of the Galaxy know that Howard the Duck already exists in the MCU. So, at the very least, the Marvel Cinematic Universe already contains evidence of Hellcow’s existence, and the existence of the character who (spoiler alert!) killed Hellcow in the comics. Hellcow/Bessie, “Super-Sized Man-Thing” #5 [Image by Marvel Comics] Dracula and Vampires \nThe essential biography of Hellcow is that she was turned into a vampire cow by Dracula about 300 years ago. Much like a vampire among humans, Bessie was able to appear as if a normal cow before changing into her vampire form and eating her human prey. Bessie/Hellcow’s only motivation was finding Dracula and exacting her revenge. Unfortunately, she mistook Howard the Duck for Dracula and the ensuing battle resulted in the cow’s death. \nWhile Marvel Comics has done a few different versions of Dracula and his ancestors over the years, only once did Dracula interact with any significantly established Marvel characters: Hulk vs. Dracula . The backstory explaining how Hulk came to meet up with the most famous vampire of all time begins with someone already entrenched in the MCU: Red Skull. As detailed in the preface to Hulk vs. Dracula #1 (2011): \n“Sin, daughter of the deceased Red Skull, has… achieved something her father never could: releasing the… Asgardian known as The Serpent.” \nIt goes on to explain that The Serpent unleashed several Thor-like hammers, one of which was received by The Incredible Hulk. Under the influence of this Hammer, Hulk becomes a possessed super-Hulk known as Nul. As Thor and Nul-Hulk battled in New York City, the alien hit the monster so hard that he landed in Eastern Europe. \nThere, Dracula united all of the vampire sects. When Nul refuses their offer of a truce, it is revealed that these are modern vampires, who take full advantage of the same sort of technology SHIELD and Hydra would have had in 2011. \nThe Nul-Hulk encounters a fleet of charniputra — flying, gargoyle-like vampires — and fends them off with no problem. A group of highly-trained vampires known as the Forgiven are sent in to distract Nul-Hulk while Dracula and the vampire military leaders put together a vampire army to try to save their part of the world from the destruction of the Nul-Hulk. \nWhen Raizo Kodo, leader of the Forgiven, concludes that there is no number of weapons or soldiers at their disposal that can stop Nul-Hulk, Dracula decides to try an Adamantium net with gravity generators — but even that can’t hold him down. Just before Nul-Hulk kills Dracula, one of the vampires uses her power of illusion to make Nul-Hulk believe she is Betty Banner/Red Hulk.

Dracula and the vampires live on in the dark in the mountain villages of Eastern Europe. \nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:05:31.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
