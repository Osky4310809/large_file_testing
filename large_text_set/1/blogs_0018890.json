AT&T is getting it, at minimum. https://t.co/qrJ2DFbwzI \n— Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 20, 2017 \n\nRecent specs rumors regarding the Galaxy J7 (2017) indicate it will house a 5.5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 625 processor, and 3 GB of RAM. A 13 MP rear camera, 5 MP front-facing camera and 3,000 mAh battery are also speculated.\nReportedly , Samsung is aiming to ship 100 million Galaxy J smartphones in 2017, compared to 60 million Galaxy S8 units.\nWould you like to see the Galaxy J7 (2017) hit the US?
