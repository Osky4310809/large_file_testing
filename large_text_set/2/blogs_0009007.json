Some aren’t opaque enough, others are more of a deep purple than a real black , and some can even fade into a weird murky brown.\nMAC is releasing a true black liquid lipstick and the ’90s goth teen ins us can’t wait to get our hands on it.\nTrue MAC junkies know this release is long overdue. As part of MAC’s Liptensity collection , they released a black shade, Stallion. It had a pretty good pigment but still could have been richer and more opaque. MAC’s Black Knight lipstick is a creme sheen and even with multiple layers just doesn’t give a gothy, jet black mouth.\nMAC’s Caviar liquid lipstick looks like the intense blacker than black we’ve been waiting for.\n#BLACK #LiquidLipstick by @maccosmetics #Caviar - pure black #Matte ! #ComingSoon *we will keep u updated What are your thoughts?
