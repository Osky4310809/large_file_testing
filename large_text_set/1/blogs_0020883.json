Christal McGee's Crashed 2005 Mercedes c230 after a collision in Hampton, Georgia on Sept. 10, 2015. Law Office of Michael L. Neff \nMaynard suffered a traumatic brain injury, his lawyer said in a statement, and he spent five weeks recovering in an intensive care unit. \nCiting activity logs, Snapchat has said that McGee was not using the app immediately before the crash. The company also said it \"actively discourage[s]\" people from using the filter while driving by displaying a \"Do NOT Snap and Drive\" warning message. \nA lawyer for Snapchat, Mark Trigg, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that the ruling is precedent-setting. \n\"A loss for Snapchat would have been dangerous, opening a floodgate of lawsuits for everyone from cell phone manufacturers to billboard advertisers to makeup brands — virtually anyone that can potentially cause a distraction from driving,\" he said. \n\"Snapchat's win instead diverts blame from these companies and requires responsible use of these technologies by the driver,\" Trigg said. \nMcGee, who was charged with serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving and other crimes, was also named in the lawsuit, which sought unspecified damages. \nMcGee's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
