As of a recent count, 27 House Republicans have said that they plan to vote against the bill, with four more Republicans indicating that they may oppose it.\nKey to the debate around the health care bill is the ACA's \"essential health benefits\" provision, which mandates that certain insurers cover services such as maternity, mental health, and substance abuse care as well as prescription drugs.\nThe provision has made coverage broader, preventing providers from offering cheap plans that cover fewer service. However, it has also reportedly increased premiums, as well as keeping Americans from choosing to purchase cheaper, more limited coverage, a reason that Republicans have sought to repeal Obamacare.\nThe bill that the house will vote on removes the essential health benefits provision, a decision which has frustrated some lawmakers. The provision's removal is likely to weaken the law's protections for those with pre-existing conditions, as well as allowing insurers to exclude coverage of more expensive services because of fewer requirements.\n\"A lot of people don't realize what the implications of that are,\" said one lawmaker. \"So we're gonna railroad this thing through and there's going to be even more people pissed off -- our constituents, stakeholders.\"\nOklahoma Republican Tom Cole has said that the vote will be a \"test\" for Republicans.\n\"It’s not a test for anyone else,\" Cole said. \"Can you govern? Or are you just an opposition party? We’re a hell of an opposition party but can we be a governing party? I think we can be but tomorrow is a hell of a decisive moment.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:55:24.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
