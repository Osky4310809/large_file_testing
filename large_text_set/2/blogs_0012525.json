They said technical difficulties! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 \nZucker, the channel’s head, however, did not look too dissatisfied with such a poor endorsement. \n“They wear those insults as a badge of honor, because it means they are doing their jobs,” Zucker told Politico. “I would say that morale is incredibly high … They are not being intimidated, they are not backing down, they know they have my full support and it is a very exciting time, frankly, to be a journalist at CNN.” \nZucker went on to say that the only downside to working for CNN at the moment is sheer worker exhaustion from all the overtime journalists and reporters have been putting in to hold the president of their country to account. \n“The pace has been nonstop, and it has not let up.” \nRead more \nZucker says he was concerned that CNN’s popularity may have taken a nosedive, especially as, according to Medialife Magazine, its ratings were worse five months ago than even MSNBC, or sworn enemy Fox News. The CNN head ordered a brand review in January to assess how attacks on it have impacted on its reputation. \nHe tells Politico the network is as strong as ever, and “incredibly trusted. We have seen no impact whatsoever in all those attacks on the CNN brand.” He noted that this year, the 25-54 age demographic put both CNN and Fox up by 50 percent over what ratings were last year in the same period. \nAccording to Zucker, the back-and-forth between Trump and the network actually is one of the main factors generating views and revenue. \nRevenue was up as well, with advertising last year making record dollars, according to Turner network President David Levy, as cited by Politico. \n“These are very good times for us, and the money is following,” Zucker concluded. \nVia RT .
