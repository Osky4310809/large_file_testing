Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net There’s no doubt in James Yap’s mind that Terrence Romeo is the future of the PBA. “With the way Terrence is playing, I think he’s the future. I know that kind of feeling when his confidence is so high.” Yap had a first hand look with how deadly the two-time Scoring Champion is as one of the bevy Elasto Painter defenders who tried and failed to stop Romeo from setting a new career-high 44 points in GlobalPort’s 117-99 win over Rain or Shine on Sunday. ADVERTISEMENT “He’s really good and hard to defend. The confidence is there, and he has a coach who trusts him and lets him do what he wants to do. It’s also the reason why he’s so hard to defend. You feel that the ring is so big when you have a confidence like that,” Yap said. Yap, a two-time PBA Most Valuable Player, also shared he has no problems passing the torch to Romeo. “I’m happy if it’s Terrence who replaces me as the face of the PBA. I just hope he brings his team to the championship. That’s the most important thing there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:31:16.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
