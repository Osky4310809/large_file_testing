It also boasted an expandable 1MB RAM and a double-sided 800 KB floppy drive. A worthy sequel \nThe $2,600 Macintosh Plus (that’s $5,725 in today’s money) shipped two years after the original Macintosh made its debut. \nIn some ways, this is the first true sequel to the Mac, since the intermediate Macintosh 512K model was virtually identical to the original, with the exception of more built-in memory. It was particularly widely used in education, and featured a few nifty innovations which made it the best Mac of its kind at the time. \nA big one was the ability to let users upgrade their Macs, which was a focus of Macintoshes during the late 1980s and early 1990s — but which Steve Jobs would never allow. \nAlthough the computer came with a not-insubstantial 1MB RAM (the first Mac came with just 128K), the Mac Plus went even further by letting users easily expand to 4MB RAM using socketed RAM boards. \nThis was a philosophical change for the Mac product line and — combined with the ability to add up to seven peripherals (hard drives, scanners, etc.) — made the Mac Plus a considerably better machine than its ancestor. \nDepending on when you bought it, the Mac Plus additionally boasted some incredibly useful software including the usual MacPaint and MacWrite, but also the excellent HyperCard and MultiFinder , which let users multitask between several applications at once for the first time. \nIf you were an Apple user at the time, chances are that you also bought Microsoft Excel and PageMaker , which were exclusive programs for a time. (The former, in fact, was exclusive only because of a terrible deal made between Apple and Microsoft .) A workhorse of a Mac \nThe Macintosh Plus was technologically superseded by the Macintosh SE and Macintosh II , which came the following year, but that didn’t slow it down. \nWith the exception of a 1987 case color change from Putty (beige) to Platinum to fit with the new Snow White design language, the Mac Plus continued to be produced as it was until October 1990 — giving it a lengthy 4 year+ lifespan. \nFor a lot of users, this was the first Macintosh which didn’t simply hint at great things to come, but actually delivered them. Historically its status as the first post-Steve Jobs Mac also makes it important. \nDid you own a Macintosh Plus? What are your memories of it? Leave your comments below. \nOh, and beginning Apple’s long string of on-screen appearances in top Hollywood movies, here’s the Mac Plus in 1986’s Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home . (It’s even being used to design a new ultra-thin aluminum, which would no doubt please Jony Ive.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:13:21.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
