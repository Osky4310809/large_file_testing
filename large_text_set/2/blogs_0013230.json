He was also dropped from its premier advertising network, Google Preferred, meaning he’ll lose some of his financial backings.\n“We’ve decided to cancel the release of Scare PewDiePie season 2 and we’re removing the PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement .\nThe move comes after Disney-owned Maker Studios said on Monday that it was also dropping the online celebrity after a report from the Wall Street Journal that he had uploaded nine anti-Semitic videos.\n“Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case, and the resulting videos are inappropriate,” a Maker Studios spokeswoman said in a statement . “Maker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward.”\nThe video above, which depicted two men holding up an anti-Semitic sign, was released back in January and has since been removed. The Indian men, who Kjellberg hired through the freelancer site Fiverr, said in a follow-up video that they didn’t they didn’t know what the message meant when they made it, or even what “Jews” meant.\nIn another video, a man dressed up as Jesus Christ said: “Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong.”\nIn a statement posted on Tumblr Sunday , Kjellberg said the point of the video was to show how you can get people to say anything for five dollars, not to spout anti-Semitic messages or give credibility to the movement.\n“I think it’s important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes,” he wrote. “As laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don’t support these people in any way.”\nIt makes sense that Maker, owned by Disney, would drop the star in response to the controversial statements since it has to maintain its family-friendly brand. YouTube does support a creator’s rights to satire but draws the line when it comes to certain sensitive subjects, like when you say anti-Semitic things.\nThe service prohibits “controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters, and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown.”\nPewDiePie has consistently been one of the most popular people on YouTube. Currently, he has over 53 million subscribers. According to Coed.com , he’s also one of the most financially successful, having earned an estimated $124 million since he started the channel in 2010.\nSo far, PewDiePie hasn’t released a statement about the controversy. His channel seems to be business as usual, with him posting a Valentine’s Day video where he and his partner play Genital Jousting .\nRegardless of whether PewDiePie meant the things he put in his videos, the fact remains he did promote anti-Semitism, which is still a serious problem internationally. Since the US election in November, ThinkProgress has tracked 261 documented hate crimes, with the majority, 26.8 percent, targeting Jewish people. When you post images such as hate speech, you’re normalizing it, making it okay to distribute. This empowers racists and people who think they can get away with it, even when it can endanger the lives of others.\n“Just putting it out there brings it more and more into the mainstream,” Jonathan Vick, an associate director of the Anti-Defamation League, said.", "external_links": ["https://thinkprogress.org/thinkprogress-has-been-tracking-hate-since-trumps-election-here-s-what-we-found-e0288ed69869#.6tp32cdar", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-severs-ties-with-youtube-star-pewdiepie-after-anti-semitic-posts-1487034533", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/pewdiepie-youtube-disney.html", "http://pewdie.tumblr.com/post/157160889655/just-to-clear-some-things-up", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8fucBzAL-0?feature=oembed?wmode=transparent", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAXxAoWAok", "http://coed.com/2016/04/04/pewdiepie-net-worth-how-much-is-pewdiepie-worth-money-youtube-star-felix-arvid-ulf-kjellberg/", "http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/disney-pewdiepie-anti-semitic-videos-1201987380/", "http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/14/14609130/pewdiepie-youtube-red-scare-pewdiepie-cancelled"], "published": "2017-02-14T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:08:24.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
