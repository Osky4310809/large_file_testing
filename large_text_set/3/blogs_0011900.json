It appears to be the same batch of camouflaged mules caught on video in Cyberjaya last week, but the cars are now registered, and have fresh KL ‘V’ plates on them. \nSo far, we know that the 530i will be part of the local launch range, which will initially be CBU fully-imported, before CKD local assembly eventually takes over. The 530i is expected to the the range topper, and it will be offered with an M Sport package and 19-inch M double-spoke style 664M alloys. \nIn Thailand, where the G30 was launched last month, the latest challenger to the W213 Mercedes-Benz E-Class is also available as a 530i M Sport, together with a 520d Luxury. It’s likely that the oil burner will also be deployed in our market in a similar line-up. \nThe 530i is powered by a B48 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbo offering 252 hp at 5,200 rpm and 350 Nm from 1,450 to 4,800 rpm, while the turbodiesel equipping the 520d is the familiar 190 hp and 400 Nm B47 2.0 litre turbodiesel seen in current outings. Both mills will be paired with a ZF eight-speed automatic transmission. \nNo word yet on what the Malaysian-spec cars will have in terms of kit, but the Thai cars should be a good guide. There, the diesel G30 comes standard with 18-inch wheels, adaptive LED headlamps, Comfort Access, a 10.25-inch touchscreen (with iDrive now equipped with gesture control), a digital meter panel and the fancy Display Key first seen with the current 7 Series . \nThe Thai 530i, meanwhile, comes with M Sport exterior and interior appointments as well as a sportier suspension setup. Other bits include a panorama glass roof, Parking Assistant, 360 degree camera view, paddle shifters, a Harman Kardon surround sound system and a wireless phone charger. \nBMW Malaysia has set up a registration of interest website for the new 5 Series a.k.a. the Business Athlete, and you can check it out here .
