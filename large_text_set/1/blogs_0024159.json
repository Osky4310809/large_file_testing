Shutterstock 2/10 Valdobbiadene Prosecco Spumante Superiore DOCG \nAldi has been upping the ante with low-priced luxury for the past year and this impressive bubbly is a fine example. Housed in a stylish bottle, it tastes just as a superior DOCG prosecco should and serves well with panettone. On the palate, dark autumn fruits mingle with delicate floral notes. Its finish was fresh, crisp and refined. Top marks all round. £6.99, Aldi, Buy it now 3/10 Bortolotti Prosecco Extra Dry \nThis fragrant blend offers hints of summer fruits and has a fresh, lingering finish. While classified as extra dry, it has a noticeable sweetness that makes it a good choice for pairing with puddings. It’s a little pricey at just over twenty pounds, but if you’re looking to impress some picky guests then this one should do the trick. £20.95, Harrods, Buy it now 4/10 Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Conegliano Prosecco 2015 \nThis is a soft sparkler that goes down nice and easy, balancing tangy citrus with gentle apricot flavours. It’s not too dry and has a very subtle sweetness, so it’s ideal for those who find most Prosecco too sugary. Great as an Apéritif and best served chilled. £10, Sainsbury’s, Buy it now 5/10 Marks and Spencer Conte Priuli ORO Prosecco 2015 \nThe perfect party Prosecco. Not only is it beautifully balanced with flavours of green apple, but its extravagant gold packaging earns it some major presentation points. It has just the right amount of fizz and a velvety texture with plenty of lasting froth. Pair with nibbles and canapés. £10, Marks and Spencer, Buy it now 6/10 Tesco Finest Prosecco Valdobbiadene DOCG \nA generously fruity blend with aromas of apple, white peach and pear. It’s pretty firm on the palate, but was a tad too citrusy for some. The finish is long, dry and slightly bitter. Best for pairing with cheeses like Gorgonzola. £10, Tesco, Buy it now 7/10 Waitrose NV Glera Italian Prosecco \nHere’s one to bring along to the next dinner party in your calendar. Light and refreshing, it boasts both floral and fruity flavours and has notes of sweet almond on the finish. Its balance of acidity and sweetness makes it great for drinking throughout the evening. £6.50, Asda, Buy it now 8/10 Asda Extra Special Prosecco \nStraight from the vineyards of North-East Italy, this wine offers crisp apple flavours with subtle mineral notes. It had a noticeable lack of fizz and was mildly sweet. Easy to drink, but nothing mind-blowing. Asda recommends blending with peach juice to create a classic Bellini. £4.99, Lidl, Buy it now 9/10 Allini Proseeco Treviso Frizzante \nA pretty average Prosecco for day-to-day drinking. With light pear notes, this one’s more suited to those looking for something soft on flavour for cocktail mixing. It’s bright and creamy, but much drier than our other contestants. £3, Waitrose, Buy it now 10/10 Ombra Di Pantera Prosecco Superiore Brut Millesimato DOCG \nFermented over 60 days, this new brand is the Porsche of proseccos. The fruity boquet is fresh and dry but without the bitterness commonly found, it has a robust sparkle that won’t fizzle out as soon as it’s poured. A great bottle to enjoy leisurely, it goes down extremely easily… some might say too much so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T12:09:40.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
