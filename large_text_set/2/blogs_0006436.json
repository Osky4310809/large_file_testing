Kim snapped at Phillip (Photo: Rex Features) She wasn't happy with him (Photo: Rex Features) \nHolly dished: \"She was fine. She lent across and said 'I do like you Phil, I do like you'. Then she said 'it's all good telly' and I thought, maybe she is just being very clever.\" \nI was a bit scared. I could see her getting bigger and more upset and it was bubbling and growing and she was getting a bit cross. Phil didn't say anything he wouldn't have said to anyone else. \n\"To be honest and I dont really know what happened, I didn't watch Big Brother this series so I hadn't seen any of that happening in the house and hadn't seen she had the potential to go. \" \nBut how about Phil? After all, he was the one who got the grilling from the reality star. The star was different off camera (Photo: Rex Features) Who really is she? 'This Morning' TV show (Photo: Rex Features) \nThanfully, Holly explained that he shrugged it off like nothing had even happened. She said: \"You never have an intention to upset somebody or make them cross or make them have that sort of reaction, you never want to do that. \n\"But he felt, as did I, nobody had said anything we wouldn't have said to anyone else,\" she added.
