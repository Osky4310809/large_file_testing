It's FREE and always will be! \nA man and a bear were minding their own business when they gave each other a big scare. A person was filming a young bear searching for food from their home in Lake Tahoe, unaware that a close encounter was about to occur. \nThe bear is seen crossing the driveway of a home in the area and reaches the corner of the house at the same time as the homeowner. The man is casually drinking from a cup and suddenly appears, leaving the videographer no time to warn him. \nIâ€™m not sure who got the bigger fright here, the man or the bear. But thankfully, both run away unharmed from their surprise meeting. \nShare this video with your family and friends. Subscribe to Reshareworthy! It's FREE and always will be!
