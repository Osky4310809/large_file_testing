Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. A post shared by Jerrod Blandino (@jerrodblandino) on Mar 25, 2017 at 1:09pm PDT \nGlitter is having a moment â€” perhaps even a year! It's no longer a holiday beauty trend, but rather a look you can rock anywhere from running errands to a girl's night out. Too Faced, one of the leaders in festive beauty, is helping you execute your sparkly dreams by launching a Glitter Bombs palette for Summer 2017. \nToo Faced founder Jerrod Blandino revealed the news on Instagram with an image of the palette and the caption: \"Get ready to sparkle! The brightening & deepening bases will revolutionize your Glitterization #June2017 #toofaced #tfglitterbomb #sneakypeek.\" Related: There Is Something Seriously Sexy From Too Faced Coming Soon \nHere's what we know so far: the palette has 10 shades, ranging from pale pink to bright blue. There are larger white (Brightening Base) and black (Intensifying Base). These can be used to lighten or darken the colors. A hot pink called \"Work It\" and iridescent purple dubbed \"Glitter Goals\" already look like standouts to us. \nSo, who else can't wait to swatch this thing when it launches in June?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T04:25:52.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
