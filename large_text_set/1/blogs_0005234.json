It showed four African American attackers beating the tied up man and taunting him with abuse.\n\"F**k Donald Trump! F**k white people!\" one of them said during the video, CNN reported.\nThe victim’s clothing was cut with a knife at one point and part of his scalp was carved.\nPresident Barack Obama described the attack as “despicable.”\nSpeaking on CNN, host Don Lemon refused to describe the attack as “evil.”\n\"I don’t think it’s evil,\" Lemon said, according to the Washington Times. \"I think these are young people, and I think they have bad home training. Who’s raising these young people? I have no idea who’s raising these young people, because no one I know on earth who is 17 years old or 70 years old would ever think of treating another person like that. It is inhumane.\"\nThe four suspects were identified as Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, Brittany Covington and Tanishia Covington.\nThe four alleged attackers have been charged with hate crimes on the basis of the statements made on the video. This means they could face longer prison terms if convicted.\nIn addition, they face charges of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery.\nPolice discovered the victim on a street in the city Jan. 3.\n\"He was bloodied, he was battered,” said  police officer Michael Donnelly, according to CNN. \"He was very discombobulated.\"\nUnsubstantiated social media reports linking the Black Lives Matter movement to the attack circulated.\n\"This is hate. And hate doesn't have a color,\" former police officer Dimitri Roberts said. \"So for folks to talk about this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter is absolutely the wrong way to look at this. ... And we cannot respond to hate with hate. It's just going to perpetuate the cycle.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:56:27.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
