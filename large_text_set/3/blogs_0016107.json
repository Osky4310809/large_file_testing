(Nance, Catherine) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   1:45 PM \nA 61-year-old man was found dead on a train rumbling through Lower Manhattan Tuesday — the fifth person to die on the city’s subway system in two weeks, officials said. \nAll four victims were not hit by trains, they noted. \nCommuters on a Queens-bound J train found the man slumped over on his seat as the train entered the Broad St. station in Lower Manhattan. \nThe man died at the scene, officials said. His name was not immediately disclosed. \nInvestigators believe that the man died of natural causes, possibly a heart attack, police sources said. \nAn autopsy has been slated to determine how he died. \nOn Friday, a 24-year-old man was found unconscious on an A train leaving the Jay St./MetroTech station in Brooklyn Heights. \nFDNY EMTs rushed the man to Brooklyn Hospital, where he died. Again, police found no evidence of foul play. \nOn March 13, maintenance workers found a man dead near the subway tracks just north of the W. 103rd St. station near Central Park West on the Upper West Side, officials said. The man had been dead for a week, cops determined. \nTwo days earlier, on March 11, a homeless man died after being found unconscious on subway tracks in Harlem, officials said. \nThe victim was discovered sprawled on the downtown tracks of the 6 train 125th St. station at about 1:15 a.m. \nFinally, on March 7, a man with no ID was found facedown on the floor of an E train at the World Trade Center, officials said. He later died at New York-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, cops said. \nNone of the deaths have been deemed suspicious, officials said.
