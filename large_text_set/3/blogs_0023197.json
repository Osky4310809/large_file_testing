And that gave 15-year-old freeskiing wunderkind Cody LaPlante an idea: What if he was to travel to the ghost town of Bodie, California, to build a once-in-a-lifetime terrain park. \nThe results, posted by Red Bull on Thursday, are absolutely beautiful: \nIt all went down at the end of February with the help of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Bodie is registered as a historic state park ) and a snowmobile. \nRELATED: Why you need to go visit a ghost town \nLaPlante made the 13-mile jaunt to the abandoned 1850s mining town via snowmobile and — under the supervision of State Parks Peace Officer Joshua Heitzmann — built a series of jumps and features throughout the town. There’s no need to jockey with the crowds at your local terrain park when you can just build your own in a ghost town.

Why go mining when the ground is covered in feet of white gold?
