The names include William Shatner, Patrick Stewart, Scott Bakula, Avery Brooks and Kate Mulgrew. \nThe program was originally set to launch in January 2017, but experienced repeated delays, so much so that “The Good Wife” spinoff, “The Good Fight,” became CBS All Access’ first program (with warm reviews to boot). The newest Starfleet ship in the CBS All Access show, \"Star Trek: Discovery.\" (Courtesy of CBS Television Studios/CBS) \nSources told Variety that much of the difficulty stemmed from Bryan Fuller stepping aside as showrunner. \nCBS Corp. boss Leslie Moonves told investors last week that he is confident in the quality of the series and that the delay is a result of extensive post production work. \nIsaacs will star alongside Sonequa Martin-Green, who currently plays Sasha Williams on the hit AMC series “The Walking Dead.” Martin-Green’s new character is lead lieutenant commander of the Starship. \nMeanwhile, James Frain (“Gotham”) will be playing Sarek, Spock’s father. \nContinuing the casting talk, Variety notes that Anthony Rapp will play a space fungus expert, and Michelle Yeoh is a captain in charge of the Starship Shenzhou. \nOther Starfleet officers will be: high-ranking official Admiral Anderson (Terry Serpico), Chief Medical Officer Dr. Nambue (Maulik Pancholy), and Ensign Connor (Sam Vartholomeos), a junior officer in the Starfleet Academy.
