According to police, Diaz was walking home from the convenience store with food for her children when she was caught in the gunfire. Residents are shocked at the senselessness of the crime. \n“It’s disgusting, that could have been my grandmother, my sister, my mother,” Eugene Eppes said. “We got children, that could have been anybody.” \nAccording to neighbor Lourdes Gomez, Diaz took her children to school, picked them up, and had a heart of gold. \n“I’m in a lot of pain, I feel very bad, very sad,” she said in Spanish through a translator. “She didn’t deserve that to happen to her.” \nDiaz was hit by a bullet in her torso and arm. She was taken to Saint Barnabas Hospital where she was pronounced dead. \nAnother man involved in the altercation was also injured, police say. \nThe father of her four young sons was too emotional to go on camera. Angel Rosario spoke with CBS2’s Raegan Medgie over the phone, and described how Diaz was simply on her way home with dinner for their sons. \nHe added now his main focus is making sure life is normal for their boys, ages 11 to 15. \n“It’s horrible that that lady came out to buy McDonalds for her kids and was shot and killed over something that she didn’t have anything to do,” Bronx resident Charlice Thumpler said. \nPolice are offering a $2,500 reward for any information leading to an arrest in this case. \nThe NYPD is asking anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers by calling (800) 577-TIPS, logging on to their website at http://www.NYPDCrimeStoppers.com or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) and entering TIP577.
