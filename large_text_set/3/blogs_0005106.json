A whole lot of people seemed not to understand how Watson could still call herself a feminist while simultaneously posing for a photo shoot that drapes fabric so as to selectively reveal part of her chest.\nTo which Watson, like the rest of us, responded:\n\nIt’s becoming exhausting, this endless inability to understand that a woman can call out sexual objectification while remaining a sexual being herself, without that making her a hypocrite. That argument is shallow and wholly misinformed, and doesn’t invite any form of rational discussion or debate. It exists simply as yet another attempt to own and police women’s bodies.\nLuckily, in an interview with Reuters , Watson doesn’t pull any punches in shutting down these meaningless, misguided attacks.\nIt just always reveals to me how many misconceptions and what a misunderstanding there is about what feminism is.\nFeminism is about giving women choice. Feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with. It’s about freedom, it’s about liberation, it’s about equality. I really don’t know what my tits have to do with it. It’s very confusing.\nI’m confused. Most people are confused. No, I’m always just kind of quietly stunned.\nDan Stevens hadn’t even heard about the conversation around the shoot, and asked what the big deal was. Watson told him people were saying she “couldn’t be a feminist and…”\n“And have boobs?” he suggested. She replied, “And have boobs.”\nStevens seemed genuinely perplexed. “That’s…not…true.”\nNo, no it’s not .\n \n(via Reuters , image via screengrab)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
