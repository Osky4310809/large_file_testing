By: FE Online | Updated: March 14, 2017 5:31 PM The Congress has gone on to form governments or stop other parties who have won majority seats in an election forming their own. (Reuters) \nCongress Vice President Rahul Gandhi accused the Bhartiya Janata Party of undemocratic behaviour in Goa and Manipur; two states where the latter is all set to form governments after falling short of gaining a majority in the legislative assembly elections. Goa is to have former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar take the oath as Chief Minister in the state, appointed by Governor Mridula Sinha. The Congress had filed a petition in the SC to stay the swearing-in ceremony, but the SC rejected it and ordered a floor test on Thursday. Speaking to the media, Gandhi said that BJP had won only 2 of the 5 states that had gone for elections. But in the two of 3 states that Congres had won, the BJP had undermined democracy using money and other financial resources. \nNow, Rahul Gandhi can cry foul all he wants but this is just another case of sour grapes. The Congress has gone on to form governments or stop other parties who have won majority seats in an election forming their own. Here are a few such incidents from the history of Independent India: \n1) In September 1999, the Congress and NCP had fought against each other in the Maharashtra Assembly Polls. The INC had with 75 seats and the NCP with 58 seats had taken out the Shiv Sena-Sena alliance(125 seats); the parties had been pre-poll partners. \n2) In 2002, in Jammu and Kashmir, the National Conference had won 28 seats but the Governor had invited the PDP & Congress with a combination of 12 and 21 seats to form the government. \nAlso watch: \n3) In 2004, Karnataka, Congress with 65 seats had been voted out and BJP had managed to secure its position as the single largest party in the 224-member house. But the INC formed a coalition government with the JDS, which had brought along 58 MLAs. \n4) In 2005, the BJP had won 30 of 81 seats in Jharkhand. The JMM leader Shri Shibu Soren with a support of 17 MLAs of his Party plus others was invited to form the Government. \n5) Most recently, in 2013 Delhi assembly elections, the BJP had won 31 seats but the AAP with 28 MLAs, with the support of the Congress, had been invited to form the government. \nSo Rahul Gandhi can cry and crib all he wants and so can the Congress. While the process of formation of a coalition government despite not being the single largest party is still debatable, such an argument coming from the Congress is just rich. Dear, Mr Gandhi, are you sure this undemocratic approach by the BJP is just a state of your mind?
