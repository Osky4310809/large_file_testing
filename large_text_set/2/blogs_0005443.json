Lizza followed up on this by arguing that there is no equivalence between Russia and America’s political practices, and the question of moral relativism is a troubling development. \nLizza also noted that Vice President Mike Pence had a hard time defending Trump’s comments during a series of interviews today . When Harlow asked Nance for her take, she began by saying she was “deeply gratified to see liberals talking about moral relativism, that’s a new subject for them…” \nLizza interjected to tell Nance that “you don’t know me,” and he scolded her for making a personal attack on him. Nance responded by calling Lizza “disrespectful” for his interruption, while he argued that it was actually disrespectful to “come on air and accuse me of not caring about moral relativism.” \nThe two continued to fight it out as Harlow stood aside. When Nance asked Harlow to call out Lizza, Harlow noted that he was defending himself from her comment.” \n“Whatever,” Nance said, dryly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:10:49.621+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
