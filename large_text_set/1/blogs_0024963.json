Could   \nWolves hero Richard Stearman revealed his Anfield triumph delivered one of the greatest moments of his life. \nThe centre-half produced a stunning defensive performance to deny Liverpool, but also found time to snatch a first minute Anfield goal at the Kop end, which proved pivotal in this fourth round tie. \nAnd the defender, who is back at Molineux on loan from Fulham just a year after leaving, said: “It’s probably one of the best days I have had in Wolves shirt and one of the best feelings I’ve had. \n“To score in front of the Kop after a minute and to go on and win the game, was just incredible. We say they had a weakened team but they are still a very good side and used to playing in front of an incredible stadium and fans. \n“So they still should be performing a little bit better but we have got a great win and we are through to the next round, and it is something special.” Stearman heads home Wolves' opener (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) Stearman peels away in front of the Kop (Photo: Getty Images) Read More Liverpool 1-2 Wolves: Jurgen Klopp in crisis after second cup exit this week \nStearman, who was born in Wolverhampton and is a hero amongst the support, added to his legend by leading from the back to snuff out Liverpool’s much vaunted strikers Roberto Firmino, Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge. \nAnd he admitted that the Reds team-sheet, with boss Jurgen Klopp making nine changes, gave his side a major boost before kick off. \n“It gave us a lift, a little bit yes, knowing the big hitters were on the bench. We knew that if we got off to a good start with the slump they are in and get the fans turned a little bit, we would be in with a very good chance.

You saw that the manager had to bring on some of their ‘so called’ better players but I thought we defended very well and managed to see the game through. \n“I think we defended really well today as a team - we had two solid banks and worked very hard. We had a game plan. \n\"We knew that Liverpool were technically very good and would try and carve us open with intricate passes and we knew that if we stayed solid and forced them wide we had a chance.” poll loading Will Wolves reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T00:46:06.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
