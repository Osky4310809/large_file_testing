But Klopp was finally back on the front foot on Monday. \nHow was he coping with the toughest spell of his Liverpool career and the scrutiny and doubts that have come with it? \n“We lost the last three games and I don’t want to ignore that but I can’t put it each morning in my backpack and say 'It’s still here.' It has to be gone, it’s over,” he declares. \n“We’ve actually played a very good Premier League season – not the best of all the teams, but it is still a very good season with a lot to go for.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Jurgen Klopp speaks ahead of Chelsea Share this video Watch Next \nKlopp is being disingenuous when he refers to the last three games. This is a deeper rut — a solitary win in eight January fixtures, and that the scruffy victory at lowly Plymouth. \nA collision with a Chelsea team that have become spiky rivals over recent years presents the perfect chance to snap out of it and lift spirits in an instant. \nHe admitted: “We haven’t given the crowd a lot to celebrate over the last few games but now is another chance. And it is the right game, a floodlit game at Anfield. It should be an outstanding atmosphere for a game against the outstanding side in the Premier League at this moment.” \nBut even though he was happy to acknowledge a Liverpool win would open up the title race, it is noticeable Klopp’s clear, short-term ambitions now appear less grand. \nThey are certainly less grand than when he wondered how “annoying” it must have been for Chelsea to win 13 games on the spin and still find Liverpool only six points adrift on New Year’s Day.

At the moment, we are one of a few, which is better than being none of them. So we can go for a real high position at the end of the league season.
