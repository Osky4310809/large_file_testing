Danny Rose and Dele Alli are also wanted by super clubs at home and abroad, while there is no team in Europe that Harry Kane would not improve. \nIn the past, this interest would have worried Tottenham. Teddy Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov, Luka Modric and Gareth Bale would make Spurs' greatest Premier League five-a-side team but their names also read as a reminder of the club's place in the old pecking order. Sheringham, Carrick and Berbatov all joined United, while Modric and Bale forced through transfers to Real Madrid. In every case, it proved the right decision for the player. \nThere is no concern at Tottenham that Dier, Alli, Rose, Kane & Co. will join that list, however. Sources at Spurs are relaxed about admiration from other clubs, regarding it as a positive sign of progress, and believe that unlike the past, any interest is entirely one-sided. There is no expectation that any important players will agitate for a transfer in the summer and only unwanted players will be sold. \nThe club is in the difficult position of trying to build a title-winning squad and an£800 million stadium simultaneously but there is no longer significant pressure to sell. Their latest financial results revealed a £33m profit, while the revenue from the current broadcasting deal is so massive, Spurs could have given away every ticket for free this season and still made more money than a decade ago, when their neighbours Arsenal were left hamstrung by their own new stadium project. \nFar from being a burden, club sources cite the new stadium as a principle reason for the top stars' desire to stay. Tottenham's players are said to be excited by the move to the 61,000-capacity venue, expected to be ready for the 2018-19 season, and they have all done a virtual reality tour of their new home -- Moussa Sissoko had to stop after feeling dizzy -- which is growing every day beside White Hart Lane. \nThe club's financial stability has also been reflected in a spate of new contracts, some of which amount to little more than well-earned pay-rises; Alli and Harry Winks have signed two new deals in the past year. Carrick had two years remaining on his contract when he joined United in July 2006 and an offer of £18.6m was considered too good to reject for a player who wanted to leave and was unlikely to sign a new deal. Eric Dier has been linked with a move to Manchester United. \nBy contrast, every one of Tottenham's current squad is tied to a long-term contract -- with the exception of Erik Lamela, who has two years left to run -- and most importantly of all, so too is Mauricio Pochettino. The manager signed a five-year deal in May, ending speculation linking him with United. \nSpurs' young squad is loyal to Pochettino and some players were only comfortable committing to the club once his future was resolved. Hugo Lloris, Tottenham's captain, has gone as far as to say his future is \" tied to Pochettino ,\" suggesting he will stay at the club as long as the Argentine is manager. \nBerbatov went on strike, refusing to play for the club and prompting then-manager Juande Ramos to tell chairman Daniel Levy he was happy for the Bulgarian to be sold for £30.5m in September 2008. None of Spurs' current squad would betray Pochettino in the same way. \nThere is an acknowledgement at Spurs the club is going places on the pitch, too. Several of the players have described winning a trophy as \"the next step\" and there is a widespread belief the squad does not need much tweaking in order to be capable of winning a maiden Premier League title. \nWhen Sheringham left for champions United in June 1997, Spurs had just finished 10th, level on points with Derby County and below Sheffield Wednesday and Wimbledon. Modric and Bale both left after Spurs missed out on Champions League qualification. With Pochettino at the helm and Spurs currently in second, Dier, Alli and Kane and their representatives believe there is no better club to continue their development, at least for now. \nSpurs cannot be bullied any more. The club holds all the aces and they feel like one of the big boys, another shift demanded by Pochettino away from the \" Lads, it's Tottenham \" reputation. Carrick was presented with a Manchester United shirt by Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney at the 2006 World Cup in Germany shortly before joining them at Old Trafford. It is unlikely that Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford considered pulling a similar stunt on Dier in Dortmund last week. \nTottenham, though, are reluctant to say their players are not for sale at any price because senior figures at the club know they could receive an offer they cannot refuse, and Levy will always run the club as a business first. But it is clear that things are different at Tottenham now. \nDan is ESPN FC's Tottenham correspondent.
