Watch video Sanjay Leela Bhansali has given in to the demands put forward by the protestors against Padmavati. Justified or no? Tell us in the comments! By Pooja Nayak | Updated: January 30, 2017 6:54 pm Umang 2017: Ranveer Singh, Tamannaah, Shahid Kapoor, made the event a starry night \nIt’s really unfortunate but Sanjay Leela Bhansali seems to have given into the demands of the group that attacked him on the sets of Padmavati in Jaipur a couple of days back. Yes, as per reports SLB has assured that the film will not have any romantic or objectionable scenes between Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji ( Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh) in the film. However, having said that the group has also demanded a review of the film before its release and change of the film’s title. Although Bhansali productions is yet to give an official statement on this but they have issued a clarification saying, “We don’t want to hurt any sentiments, would appreciate if all social orgs support us in making this film.” Not to mention, in a tweet, Giriraj Singh of Rajput Sabha said, “They (Bhansali Prod.) have agreed there will be no intimate scene between Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in any form. Demand to form a screening committee before the release of the movie is still to be fulfilled.” \nState President of Karni Sena, Mahipal Singh Makrana addressed the press this afternoon and announced the agreement he’s fixed with Team Padmavati after the protest. He’s reasoned that his sena didn’t manhandle Bhansali out of choice but instead were forced to take an action after SLB’s guards fired at them the moment they landed on the sets. In the video released by Times Now, you can even hear the Karni Sena president arguing the fact they have been demanding a clarification from the filmmaker since the last 5-6 months. But considering Team Padmavati didn’t pay any heed to their demands, the protestors had to deal their way, affirms the president. #WATCH State President of Karni Sena, Mahipal Singh Makrana addresses the press. #FringeVsBollywood pic.twitter.com/8aTa5fTnqe \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) January 30, 2017 \nBhansali Productions’ official Twitter handle has been clarifying through tweets stating: \nहमे खुशी होगी अगर वहां के लोग फिल्म बनाते समय हमारी सहायता करे और पुरी दुनिया मे रानी पद्मावती जानी जाएं उनकी सुंदरता और साहसिकता के लिये.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T16:05:56.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
