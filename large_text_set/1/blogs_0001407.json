He warned that repealing Obamacare \"will create chaos. Because you cannot repeal a plan and put nothing in its place. It doesn't matter if you say the repeal won't take place for year [ sic ] or two years.\"\nDemocrats are launching an all-out effort to salvage Obamacare, with President Obama coming to Capitol Hill Wednesday to rally his party behind the law. At the same time, Vice President-elect Mike Pence is meeting with Republicans about rolling it back.\nContrary to Schumer, Republicans do indeed have plans to replace Obamacare, and here is the one that seems most likely .\nDisplaying his political savvy, the Senate minority leader declared that Democrats don't just care about Obama's health care law. \"Our message is not just on Obamacare. Our message is don't cut health care,\" Shumer said. \"Medicare. Medicaid. Obamacare.\"\nThis is smart messaging, because a great deal of Obamacare focused on expanding Medicaid, a program which suffers from massive fraud . Any plan to dismantle Obama's health care law would likely cost Medicaid in the meantime â€” a benefit for taxpayers but a public relations struggle. Democrats could use this aspect of reform to brand Republicans as evil lovers of the rich who would remove health care from the poor.\nEven though Senate Democrats face a challenging election map in 2018, Schumer was confident that his colleagues would remain steadfast in opposing Republican plans to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nBill Clinton on Obamacare: 'It Doesn't Make Sense'\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/04/schumer-slogan-repealing-obamacare-will-make-america-sick-again/\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/house-gop-obamacare/488168/", "http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/schumer-takes-hard-line-against-republicans-on-obamacare-233166"], "published": "2017-01-04T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T20:44:02.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
