Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nHuckberry\nAfter trying out the brand's 10 Year Hoodie last year , Flint and Tinder quickly became one of our favorite men's clothing brands at Insider Picks.\nWhile still small and growing, the brand's commitment to making a select amount of high-quality products was abundantly clear. The internet agrees — you don’t Kickstart your way to a million dollars without a good amount of public support.\nFlint and Tinder recently came out with its Supima Air Knits , a new line of shirts made from California Supima cotton and knit with a new technique that creates a soft, luxurious fabric. The brand is so confident in the new shirts, they’ve gone as far to market them as the “Cashmere of Cotton,” a bold claim the Insider Picks team was eager to put to the test.\nA few members of the team got the chance to try out the garments from the Supima Air Knits line , including the tee , long sleeve tee , and polo shirt .\nYou can find our thoughts on the new shirts below:\nBreton Fischetti, senior director, commerce: The polo from Flint and Tinder is another win for them. It's really soft; I can see why they call this material the cashmere of cotton. On style, the shirt has a good fit, and its collar design is retro without being out-of-date. It has kind of a Mad Men-style vibe about it, which I normally wouldn't go for, but since I have a couple polos already, it's a great change of pace. I can tell I'm going to wear this a lot during the summer.\nAs for the long sleeve , I'm glad that these shirts come pre-shrunk, because the large, which is my usual size, is a little tight on me. If that's a concern, I'd recommend sizing up. The shirt is a good shape; it's made of the same super-soft material and is a good weight to wear both when it's warm and cool out. It's definitely not something you'd layer over another shirt, though. I really liked the fit of the sleeves, which is tighter than other similar shirts.\nHuckberry\nBrandt Ranj, associate commerce editor: I’m new to the world of long-sleeve tee shirts; I’ve traditionally been a short-sleeved undershirt or regular tee shirt fan, but I think I might be wavering a bit.\nFlint and Tinder’s long-sleeve tee shirt keeps my arms a little extra toasty when I’m out and about in the cold winter months, while being the perfect level of casual to wear around my apartment. It’s thin, but soft and comfortable to wear, and even sleep in.\nIt’s a little annoying to have to roll up two sets of sleeves when I’m typing at my desk, but that’s a small bump while wearing a new style of clothing.\nTyler Lauletta, commerce reporter: I have been a huge fan of Flint and Tinder ever since I started wearing my 10 Year Hoodie last year . The original slub pocket tee is one of the best shirts I own, and I am sure I will tell you more about them once they are back in stock.\nThe Supima Air Knits line did not disappoint. A bit lighter than the slub pocket tee, both the tee and long sleeve were form fitting and comfortable. Their softness can’t really be overstated here. As for the polo , I am never really a fan of them, and while this one was a bit of a change of pace from what you would find from your standard polo shirt, it’s not something I’ll be breaking out of my closet on a regular basis — but I blame that solely on my personal style, rather than the make or quality of the shirt.\nFlint and Tinder's Supima Air Knit Tee retails for $38. The Supima Air Knit LS Tee goes for $48 , and the Supima Air Knit Polo goes for $68.\nYou can check out everything from Flint and Tinder's Supima Air Knit line at Huckberry.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
