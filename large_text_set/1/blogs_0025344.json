The defensive midfielder had completed one year of a three-year deal with Guangzhou R&F, but a recent rule change restricting the number of foreigners per team in the Chinese Super League led to Svensson's move to Seattle. \n“Everything happened very fast, but it turned out really well,” Svensson said in a club release. “When I came to Seattle I fell in love with the city and the club. I had some friends play here before, both in MLS and in Seattle, so I know a lot about it.” \nA 10-year veteran with professional experience in Sweden, Turkey and Ukraine, Svensson is expected to compete for a starting spot in Seattle's central midfield. \n“We’re excited to add Gustav to our roster,” Sounders general manager Garth Lagerwey said. “He brings a wealth of experience, a track record of success and versatility to our team and we’re eager to see how he impacts our squad in 2017.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:32:58.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
