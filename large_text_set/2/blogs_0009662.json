On December 14, the Cardinals cut Floyd because of his arrest on suspicion of DUI. Floyd was charged with one count of obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a police officer, along with two counts of DUI .\nTwo days after being arrested, and one day after being released, the Patriots picked him up off of waivers .\nHe didn’t play in the AFC Championship or the Super Bowl, and earned more than $1.2 million for his time with the team. Floyd tweeted the following after winning the Super Bowl with the Patriots:\nTalk about a 180. #believeinyourself #SuperBowlChampions pic.twitter.com/Z2YVVLlBfJ \n— MichaelFloyd (@MichaelMFloyd) February 6, 2017 In the replies to the tweet, many people criticized Floyd and felt that he shouldn’t have received a ring. He was on the Patriots because of a DUI arrest, and hadn’t done much in their championship run. In the two regular season games that he did play in for New England, Floyd started one, had six targets, and four catches for 42 yard and one score.\nWhen Floyd came to the realization that people weren’t happy for him because of how he arrived in New England, he brushed it off.\nDamn I just realized ppl are really mad that I got a ring. I thought everyone would be happy for me. Oh well. I'm a champion!!\n— MichaelFloyd (@MichaelMFloyd) February 7, 2017 His former teammate in Arizona Antonio Cromartie showed support for him, just as others had when he initially signed with the Patriots :\nI'm happy for you @MichaelMFloyd .\n— ANTONIO CROMARTIE (@CRO31) February 7, 2017 @MichaelMFloyd they for you when it's convenient for them. Can't listen to them. Love you bro.\n— ANTONIO CROMARTIE (@CRO31) February 7, 2017 As SB Nation’s Arizona Cardinals blog Revenge of the Birds indicates , many Cardinals fans are upset not just because of the aforementioned reasons. They want to see Larry Fitzgerald win a Super Bowl ring after putting up Hall of Fame numbers. \nThe fact that Floyd got his on the bench after getting a DUI has left a bad taste in the mouths of Cardinals fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:36:55.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
