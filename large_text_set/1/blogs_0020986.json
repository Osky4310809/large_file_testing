The group targeted high-end homes and used the money from the stolen items mainly on luxury meals, strip clubs and travel.\n“Crime doesn’t have borders,” Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O’Toole said. “Thanks to a collaborative partnership between our law enforcement agencies, the suspects responsible for these numerous burglaries were caught arrested and will be held accountable.”\nHernandez was not the only professional athlete revealed this week to be a target of a burglary ring. The Philadelphia home of Raptors guard Kyle Lowry is one of many the police are investigating as they attempt to recover millions of dollars in jewelry stolen from across the Delaware Valley.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:25:01.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
