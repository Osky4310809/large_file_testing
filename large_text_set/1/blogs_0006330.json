You have to carry around the hate, the anger and the disappointment till you find a way to let go. And it gets messier when you are on the receiving end of someone's wrath. You might understand where the anger is coming from, and are ready to apologise a thousand times, but what can you do when people simply refuse to forgive and forget? Maybe it's hard for them to move on, or that's simply the kind of people they are. Either way, you need to deal with them in a way that doesn't affect you too deeply. If you have a friend, or even a family member who simply refuses to let a grudge go, here's how you can try and make things right again. Listen \nIf you've apologised and explained your side of the story, and the other person still cannot seem to let go, have an open conversation with them. Just listen this time, and instead of explaining your end of the story all over again, just let them vent and let out all the anger, hurt and disappointment. Speaking about their exact feelings, without any filter, will help them heal and move on. Accept your fault ... to a certain degree \nThe person feels a strong sense of being wronged and maybe also feels like he or she was treated like a victim. You need to let go of your ego here, and genuinely ask for forgiveness. Having said that, remember that there is a thin line between honestly asking for forgiveness and grovelling and if you feel that the person is holding on to the anger as a way to get back to you, maybe it's time for a re-think. Which brings us to our next point... Give it a good thought \nWhy are you so affected by this person holding a grudge against you? Do you secretly believe all these things that this person accused you of? Or are you tired of apologising and being blamed? Give it a good, honest thought and mull over whether or not you really need to fix this situation. There's only so much you can do, and sometimes, the person will use the grudge to hold power over you and in that case it's simply not worth it. If the person knows that holding on to this is causing you pain, and if he or she still does it, do you really need this relationship in your life? Let go \nBe realistic in your expectations of forgiveness. You cannot force someone to forgive you just because you need some peace of mind. If he or she is hurt and cannot let go, it's kinder to accept your mistake and simply give them some more time, or just accept the fact that they will never really be able to let go. You also need to deal with it in your own way.
