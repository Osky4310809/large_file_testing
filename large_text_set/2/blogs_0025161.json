'Organised attack' \nMcWhirter, from Edinburgh, will be sentenced on 21 March. \nDundee Sheriff Court was told that McWhirter was caught after returning to the scene of one of his early false birth registrations at Aberdeen registry office where he was recognised by staff. \nAround the same time, an \"organised attack\" on HMRC's computer systems - which showed that about 350 requests had been received for tax credit application forms from an address in Dundee and others in Campbeltown linked to McWhirter - triggered other alarms. \nDepute fiscal Vicki Bell told the court that McWhirter presented letters to registrars at various offices throughout Scotland purporting to be from doctors confirming the births of children at home. \nDuring the meetings he acted as if he was the male named on the marriage certificate while registering the birth, the court was told. False registrations \nMiss Bell said: \"Four of the names used as claimants were traced and they advised they didn't make the claims. \n\"They had all, however, applied for the same job for front-of-house staff at a four-star hotel in Glasgow advertised on Gumtree on March 2015. \n\"The ad required a CV and a national insurance number. \n\"It was then discovered that 14 claims for tax credits had been made by persons residing in Perth Road, Dundee, and in Campbeltown at flats related to the accused's company.\" \nAfter being traced, McWhirter said he considered the registration system in Scotland \"archaic and easy to create false registrations.\" \nMcWhirter admitted a charge of fraud committed between 1 June 2014 and 22 October 22 at addresses across Scotland. \nHis solicitor John McLeod told the court his client was under no illusion that imprisonment was likely to be \"at the top of the list\".
