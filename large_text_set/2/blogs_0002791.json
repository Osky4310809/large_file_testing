But now, the State Department is warning travelers that it could take even longer than that. So why all the warnings? \nIt’s due to an expected increase in passport renewals. \nIn 2007, Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative required American citizens to flash their passport when traveling to either Canada or Mexico. Now those passports are expiring and are being renewed. \nOn top of that, there’s a new act that’s going to be set in motion in January of 2018 called the Real ID Act. The Real ID Act requires residents of some states to have alternative forms of identification. \nThe State Department suggests that if you’re looking to renew your passport, get after it before your current one gets under nine months to expiration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:11:04.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
