Former Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman speaks exclusively to ESPN FC about Liverpool's progress under Jurgen Klopp. \nSupporters used to be more concerned with new signings than what's happening with players already at the club, but nowadays news on contract improvements can be just as significant. \nNew deals for Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana were given big exposure by Liverpool in recent weeks, with the England midfielder the latest to put pen to paper on an extension on Wednesday. \nThe psychology is interesting, with a club saying to its supporters \"the player currently doing so well is being tied up for the future.\" That amuses Liverpool fans, considering their recent experience of Luis Suarez leaving less than a year after similar fanfare for his improved deal. \nRealists are less cynical, recalling how Raheem Sterling was left to stew over his contract while flops like Mario Balotelli came in and immediately earned much more than he did. \nSterling did well enough in the 2013-14 campaign to warrant respect and a new deal. The club were in part saved by Sterling's somewhat mouthy agent, immediately creating a pantomime villain everybody could hide behind -- while Sterling left to ply his trade at a more ambitious club in Manchester City. Adam Lallana is the latest player to put pen to paper on a contract. \nHas a lesson been learned? Coutinho and Lallana have been largely excellent this season. The Brazilian may have returned from injury firing on less than all cylinders but most don't expect that to last too long. \nFor a club like Liverpool, which is not super-rich but not exactly paupers, the needle is a tough one to thread. Fans want the best but they also despise those who under-perform while being over-paid. \nThe manager's judgement should be the determining factor in all this, but at Anfield in recent times it doesn't feel as if that's been the case. \nWhether Brendan Rodgers wanted Balotelli or not, whether he was hampered by incompetence when it was believed Dele Alli would choose Liverpool and not Tottenham, these things remain infuriatingly muddled. Fans only ever get conflicting testimony, if such things are ever discussed at all. \nIt's interesting how Coutinho and Lallana get new contracts but Emre Can doesn't. Again, his demands are not known and it was unfortunate that the reported impasse came to light publically when the player was performing poorly. \nBut with Can's deal expiring at the end of next season, the club are going to have to make a decision one way or the other very soon. \nThings like that happen often in football, and cynics will say such information is often deliberately made public to put the player in an unflattering light. This example may not be so cut and dried, as it's fair to say Jurgen Klopp has a lot of time for his compatriot. \nIn fact, there's been occasions when his selection of Can has caused concern -- the last time being at Hull City when the Reds suffered an embarrassing 2-0 defeat. He was picked ahead of Georginio Wijnaldum, mystifying many, and that was further questioned when the Dutchman gave a star performance in a 2-0 win over Tottenham. \nCan was by no means the worst player at Hull -- ironically, Coutinho was -- but as he watched from the bench for the first 77 minutes as his teammates raised their game against Spurs he was entitled to feel slightly vexed. Emre Can is out of contract at Liverpool in the summer of 2018. \nHe has spoken of how he can sense the crowd's disenchantment with his performances, yet it must also be remembered this is his third season at Anfield. \nYounger players can always blame inexperience during hard times but after 100 games in red, and now at the age of 23, fans are entitled to see a reasonable degree of improvement. \nIt's hard to believe reported links to Juventus, since Can does not look close to that level yet, but this is a Germany international with lots of time left to develop. \nLiverpool's style and formation may be hampering the player and if he can't find his true niche at Anfield perhaps he'd feel moving is the only option. Wages then become a secondary factor. \nThis is tricky as with European football a possibility next season, Klopp will need a stronger squad. He keeps giving Can a chance, yet with only league games left for the rest of the season it's hard to see how he can justify giving him a starting place. \nHerein lies the dilemma for the modern manager; keeping players sweet with promises of future involvement. \nHe could pay him enough money to tolerate extended spells on the bench, but Liverpool isn't that kind of club and ultimately a decent player with ambition won't want that anyway. \nThe solutions aren't always obvious. Klopp can't really select a formation that suits Can, since his best players largely flourish in the formation he chooses now. \nDiversity is key for any manager, however, and just waving goodbye to internationals on the cusp of their prime doesn't usually work out for the best. \nWith the injuries Klopp's squad has suffered already, Can's chance to shine will come sooner rather than later but he does need to improve -- and quickly. \nLiverpool can't keep letting promising young players leave but nor can they indulge underperforming players forever. \nSteven Kelly is one of ESPN FC's Liverpool bloggers.
