adidas argentinia – 1953, football shoe worn at the 1954 FIFA world cup in switzerlandshoe size: 8,5 (uk), 436 gimage © adidas \n\n\nfrom fritz walter’s 1954 football boots, to lionel messi’s 2012 F50 cleats, designboom takes a look at the history of adidas with a selection of classic football boots from the past 50 years. ritz walter wore the shoe both prior to and during the 1954 world cup in switzerland. the shoe was resoled after the world cup. the argentinia was revolutionary. until that point, football boots were primarily designed to protect the foot. the boot, which was developed for the german national team, was the first to fulfil the requirements which still stand for football boots today: it was lightweight and flexible, and provided good contact with the ball and secure contact with the pitch. significant improvements included a narrower last and a lower-cut upper. the hard toe cap was dispensed with, the outsole was flexible and the boot featured easily changeable thread inserts, which were pressed through the insole and outsole from the inside (1952 patent), along with slim 18 mm nylon screw-in studs. \n\nmaterials: the upper is made of box calf, the vamp and back lining of calf leather. the tongue lining and inlay sole are twill. insole and outsole are made of vegetable tanned bottom leather (vache leather). \n\nfritz walter – adidas argentinia, 1953 –

usually signaled the end of an athlete’s career. adi dassler designed a special orthopedic shoe which enabled the athlete to play again as early as august of the same year. it was wearing this shoe that uwe seeler scored the deciding goal at the world cup qualifying match against sweden on 26 september. the heel construction with lacing and built-in cushioning takes the pressure off the rear foot and the achilles tendon and provides additional support. it has been worn by athletes suffering from problems such as bursitis, achilles tendon injuries and heel spurs. due to the integrated heel pad, the shoe had to be worn half a size up. \n\nmaterials: the upper leather and lining are made of black, specially tanned cow hide. the heel seat insert is made of kangaroo leather. the pads are made of 10 mm foam. the insole is made of vegetable tanned bottom leather (vache leather). the pre-fabricated outsole is made of blue polyamide (nylon). the studs and the washers are made of aluminium. \n\nuwe seeler – adidas achilles, 1965 – bottom view \n\nbobby moore – adidas diamant – 1966, football boots worn at the FIFA world cup in england shoe size: 7 (uk), 304 gimage © adidas \n\n\nengland’s robert (bobby) moore became world champion wearing this boot in london in 1966. the athlete himself was responsible for the unconventional choice of studs and the indentations on the ball studs. the boot was modelled on the “diamant” and produced on a special last which was created to replicate bobby moore’s foot. \n\nmaterials: the upper leather and lining are made of black, specially tanned cow hide (water-repellent). the pads are made of 10mm foam. the insole is made of vegetable-tanned bottom leather (vache leather). the pre-fabricated outsole is made of blue polyamide

outer ball of his right foot. the boot was made using a last adapted to match the athlete’s foot. franz beckenbauer has narrow feet and takes between a uk size 7 and 7.5. the crushed patent leather is very light, soft and smooth; it also repels water and dirt. \n\nmaterials: the upper is made of black crushed patent leather, the back lining of calf leather. the facings are made of white cow hide.
