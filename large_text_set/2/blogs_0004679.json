Please don't make up attacks. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 \nShe was of course referring to this morning's Paris attack in which a lone machete-wielding man rushed a group of soldiers outside the famous museum and was shot dead before doing any damage. \nIt's an actual attack that you can look up. Not Kellyanne's brand of fake news. \nRelated: OMG, There's A Bowling Green Massacre Victims Fund Now! \nBut of course professional turd polisher Conway couldn't help but respond directly to Chelsea, tweeting: \nBosnia lie a Great reminder. And 2 @ChelseaClinton & others, you can't \"invent\" quality candidates either. I misspoke; you lost the election https://t.co/7TwnX2b5yA — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 3, 2017 \nInteresting how their go-to defense is always that they won the election, like that somehow makes the horrible things they're saying and doing right. \nWe're guessing Chelsea is washing her hands of this, but MAN we'd love to see an actual live debate between these two. \n[ Image via Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/ WENN / NBC . ] Famous People Who Fist Fight!
