If we were to hazard a guess, we’d say it’s South Korea as Samsung typically releases its flagship smartphones a little earlier in its home country (and, of course, that’s where the publication is based).\nOn the topic of pre-orders, The Investor believes that Korean Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus pre-registrations will exceed the 400,000 figure mark hit by the Galaxy Note 7 in its 13-day pre-order period last year, which seems feasible considering the Galaxy S series has more mainstream appeal.\nAfter the Galaxy S8’s unveiling on March 29, Samsung will reportedly hold a “nationwide hands-on event” (once again, presumably in South Korea) to give potential customers some one-to-one time with the device. If they like what they see, they’ll be able to place an order there and then.\nPulling out all the stops In an effort to recover from the embarrassing Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung is rumored to be pulling out all the stops with the Galaxy S8. Aside from releasing two variants — the 5.8-inch S8 and the 6.2-inch S8 Plus — it will also debut a new artificial intelligence assistant called Bixby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:47:49.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
