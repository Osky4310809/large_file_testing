Industry forecasters suggest the set could debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart next week, with perhaps 120,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Feb. 9. The arrival of I Decided spurs three other gains for Big Sean songs: “Sacrifices,” featuring Migos , debuts at No. 29. “Bounce Back” climbs 35-34 after previously reaching No. 4 and “Halfway off the Balcony” re-enters at No. 36 following its No. 43 debut two weeks ago. \nJust below “No Favors,” Imagine Dragons start at No. 4 with “Believer,” earning their first top 10 hit among nine entries since the chart began in May 2014. The band released the track and its official YouTube audio on Feb. 1, with the clip jumping to 3.4 million global views on Youtube through Feb. 8. \n“Believer” is perhaps the first taste of a third Imagine Dragons studio album. Their most recent set, 2015’s Smoke + Mirrors , debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the group’s first chart-topper there. \nThe new single sparks 41,000 Twitter mentions in the week ending Feb. 5, according to Next Big Sound, a gain of 263 percent. \n[embedded content] \nAlso in the top 10, Mariah Carey scores a No. 9 arrival for “I Don’t,” featuring YG . The diva teased the song in the final episode of her E! docuseries Mariah’s World , five days before its official Feb. 3 release. The same day, Carey premiered the song’s music video, which she directed. The clip, which features her burning her actual wedding dress for her planned marriage to James Packer, has garnered 8.7 million global views on YouTube. \n[embedded content] \nThe new Carey cut helps power the superstar to 51,000 Twitter mentions, up 162 percent. \nLastly, Depeche Mode moves in at No. 13 with its new single “Where’s The Revolution.” The song alludes to the heightened political tension in the United Kingdom and United States, with lyrics such as “You’ve been kept down / You’ve been pushed ‘round / You’ve been lied to / You’ve been fed truths.”“Revolution” previews the group’s fourteenth studio album, Spirit , due out March 17. \n[embedded content]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:16:46.556+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
