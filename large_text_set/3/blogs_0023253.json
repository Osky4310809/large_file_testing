There are many countries where such a situation exists. There is a social security number in America and in India it (Aadhaar) could be the counterpart,\" he said. File Image of Arun Jaitley. PTI \nExplaining the rationale behind making Aadhaar mandatory for filing income tax returns, Jaitley said the move is aimed at curbing tax evasion. \nHe said as many as 98 percent of adults or 108 crore people have Aadhaar number. For filing I-T returns, they can either give the number or mention that they have applied for Aadhaar. \n\"...but the government won't allow them to evade tax,\" he said. \nJaitley said more people were required to be brought into the tax system and that is why the tax slab has been lowered this year. \nAs parties like BJD opposed the move to make Aadhaar mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns and making PAN application, Jaitley said, \"Aadhaar has biometric details, so its chances of misuse become minimal. When the country has so much technology, and when it is being put to use, then why create such a hue and cry about it? It is an anti-evasion measure which will benefit the country. So the government considers it right to implement it,\" he said. \nWhen Mohammed Salim (CPIM) remarked that if Aadhaar was so useful, then why doesn't the government make it an purpose card, Jaitley said, \"A stage may come when unique identity card (Aadhaar) may become the sole card.\" \n  07:02   07:02 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:36:13.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
