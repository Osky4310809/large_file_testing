Advertisement \nThe first season pulled in some very strong ratings but it remains to be seen how the ladies will do with what I assume is a full season as opposed to the abbreviated debut. One thing’s for sure, however: they’re all trying very, very hard. \nFor some reason, women on Potomac come off more as caricatures of Real Housewives than actual Real Housewives which I’ll admit is an extremely stupid sentence but it’s what I feel. Advertisement \nKaren is still ridiculous and is maybe broke. She apparently moved out of her house in the middle of the night into a rental and I won’t lie and say I’m not excited for that storyline. \nGiselle is still mean and a horrific dresser. Robyn is still sad and dealing with her trifling ex-husband. Katie is gone which is truly for her own good. Ashley is begging her daddy/husband not to close her restaurant. I don’t care what Charrisse is doing and there’s a hot young new girl named Monique who is pulling out all the stereotypical first season stops: rich husband, bragging about having sex with her rich husband, showing off a hot body and picking fights with the elders. \nThere’s also an offensive-looking event which I can only describe as an “Indian” party but that’s to be expected from a group of women who don’t fully understand whether someone is or is not black.
