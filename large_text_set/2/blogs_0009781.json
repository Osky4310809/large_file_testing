We are now commencing a sale process, alongside other options. The Bank’s ethical heritage and customer proposition will be a central consideration in this,” said Holt. \nWhen problems at the Co-op bank started to emerge in 2013 it was discovered that the bank – then majority owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes – needed £1.5bn. Paul Flowers, its former chairman, was later fined for possessing cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and was dismissed as a minister by the Methodist church earlier this year . \nThe troubles at the bank, which has 4 million customers, left a cloud over the co-operative sector. The Co-op Group now owns just 20% of the bank, with the rest owned by bondholders, largely the hedge funds that participated in the 2014 rescue. \nLiam Coleman, the chief executive, said the attempts to turnaround the bank had been slowed down by the impact of low interest rates and the “sheer scale” of the transformation, in part required after the bank’s merger with the Britannia Building Society just as the financial crisis was getting under way. \nThe PRA said it welcomed the actions announced by the Co-operative Bank. It added: “We will continue to assess the bank’s progress in building greater financial resilience over the coming months.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:22:50.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
