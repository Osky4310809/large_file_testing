Chance the Rapper winning Best New Artist and Best Rap Album, then proving he deserved both with an emotional medley of \"How Great\" and \"All We Got\" with a full gospel choir. Beyoncé's weirdly mesmerizing fertility-goddess performance of \"Love Drought\" and \"Sand Castles.\" Bruno Mars achieving Peak Purple with a note-perfect re-creation of Prince's \"Let's Go Crazy.\" The distinct, serrated sound of a Roland 303 acid synth line creeping into Daft Punk and The Weeknd's collaborative track \"I Feel It Coming.\" \nThe hands-down highlight of the telecast, even before Busta Rhymes came out and referred to our commander-in-chief as \"President Agent Orange,\" was A Tribe Called Quest. When they launched into a medley of \"Award Tour\" and \"Can I Kick It?\" with L.A.'s own Anderson .Paak on drums and an unoccupied microphone stand commemorating their fallen brother, Phife Dawg, it seemed to wake the entire Staples Center from an Adele-and–Ed Sheeran–induced coma. Tribe's five minutes made most of the rest of the Grammys' interminable 3½ hours — above-mentioned highlights aside — feel like a wake. \nWhich, in a way, it was. The Grammys represent a music industry that has largely, over the last 15 years or so, lost its center and lost the plot. How else to explain that safest of safe superstars, Adele, shutting out Beyoncé and her career-best album Lemonade in all four categories in which they competed head-to-head? How else to explain a bizarrely miscast Bee Gees tribute in a year that could have featured expanded tributes to Prince or George Michael, or any tribute at all to such brilliant, outspoken talents as Leonard Cohen, Merle Haggard, Juan Gabriel or Sharon Jones? How else to explain the godawful act of career desperation (on both parties' parts) that was Lady Gaga rocking out with Metallica?
