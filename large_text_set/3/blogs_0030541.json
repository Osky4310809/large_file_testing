File photo MANILA, Philippines — The rift between the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and the Office of the Cabinet Secretary has been taken to the next level as both parties mull possible legal cases against each other. In an interview, preventively suspended PCA Administrator Avelino Andal said his team is now studying possible legal options against Undersecretary Halmen Valdez and even Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco following the suspension order against him. Andal has been accusing Valdez of influencing Evasco to issue various orders, not just to the PCA but to other agencies including the National Food Authority (NFA) and the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). RELATED: PCA chief defies suspension order \"We will be taking legal options and perhaps going to the court. We are still assessing [cases to be filed] against Valdez herself and possibly against Cabinet Secretary Evasco also since he was the one who signed the order,\" Andal told The STAR. He added that he might file cases this week. \"I am already maligned and was not given the basic due process. They have been prostituting the process,\" Andal said. Andal has been issued a 90-day preventive suspension since last week by Evasco over corruption allegations and is now under pressure to explain the administrator’s recent actions, including the illegal collection of fees. In a separate interview, Valdez said she is still thinking of whether she will file a case or not against Andal following his recent attacks via social media. \"He has been cyberbullying me and has made a lot of libelous remarks against me and such behavior is unbecoming of a public officer,\" Valdez told The STAR. \"With his personal remarks, I’m still [thinking] about it. I’m sincerely worried about his old age and I’m trying my best to stretch my patience,\" she added. For the past week, Andal has been attacking Valdez on Facebook saying she is an ally of former President Benigno Aquino III. \"I believe that Halmen Valdez is a major party to the destabilization campaign and maligning the PCA administrator, and suspending me is part of the grand scheme,\" he said. \"Miss Yellow Worm Valdez, show proof that I am the mastermind of extortion that you alleged. You could be a liar if you can’t show proof. What if I say, in return, that I have info that you are the mastermind of prostitution? I believe you are the mastermind in undermining the anti-corruption efforts of President Duterte,\" Andal added. Valdez, on the other hand, said the Board has already issued a gag order to those involved. \"In Cabinet Secretary’s words, ‘Let Andal do his worst.’ The evidence against him is strong and he knows it,\" Valdez said. \"The board will have to decide collectively if we will file a case after the investigation,\" she added. Andal maintained Valdez is instituting a grand plan similar to what happened to NIA chief Peter Laviña. Laviña was forced to resign on alleged corruption issues, while NFA chief Jason Aquino is also under investigation. Andal also emphasized that the current plot against him is in relation to the nearing release of the P75 billion coconut levy fund. \"I really think that they want to get a hold of PCA and they are looking forward to the time that the coco levy funds will be given to the farmers via the PCA,\" he said. A bill for the release and use of the coconut levy fund is now with Congress and is being fast-tracked for the benefit of the industry.
