Greg Bird has found the power.\nAfter Joe Girardi declared Bird had won the Yankees first-base battle, the lefty slugger went out and bashed two long home runs Wednesday, his fifth and sixth of the spring, in a 7-3 win over the Phillies at Spectrum Field.\nThis Bird is a much better Bird than the Yankees saw in 2015. He has come back from shoulder surgery stronger, mentally and physically, and is batting .439 this spring.\nThere is so much talk in baseball about bat speed, but getting the barrel of the bat to the ball is what this power game is all about.\nThat is what Bird, who also has six doubles, is about and that’s why the baseball booms off his bat like his two blasts against Phillies right-handler Vince Velazquez, good for five RBIs.\n“I’ve really learned, whether I hit it up, down, straight — hit it on the barrel, because the barrel plays,’’ Bird told The Post on his way out of the clubhouse. “So front, back, center, right and left — hit it on the barrel.’’\nThat’s his power philosophy and now that he is stronger following shoulder surgery, specifically he has more upper back strength, the barrel really, really plays.\nYour browser does not support iframes. A man who knows about power is Mr. October. Reggie Jackson, who blasted 563 home runs during his Hall of Fame career, said Bird and Gary Sanchez have what he calls, “Barrel accuracy … They know where the barrel is.’’\nA great term.\n“The barrel plays,’’ Bird said, “so it’s always been important to me.’’\nNoted one scout at the game, “Bird looks so good this spring, and that’s a Yankee Stadium swing.’’\nThe barrel plays at Yankee Stadium.\nBird has more home runs this spring than Yoenis Cespedes. He has the same number as Bryce Harper. Only former Yankees minor leaguer Peter O’Brien (Royals) has more spring training home runs, with seven.\nSEE ALSO \nGreg Bird's swing is heating up Yankees' Chris Carter debate 0:0 BRADENTON, Fla. — Asked to compare Greg Bird’s sweet swing... When Girardi was asked earlier in the day if Bird is going to be his first baseman, the manager responded: “I don’t see anything changing that. He’s been really good, maybe better than what I expected, knowing that he sat out a year and you worry about guy’s timing. It hasn’t seemed to affect him.’’ Chris Carter is hitting .108 with 20 Ks in 37-at-bats.\nThe shoulder-surgery ordeal only made Bird stronger.\n“I’m a better player than I was then,’’ Bird said. “I feel better. I do. Physically and mentally. I think rehab, you can go one or go two ways with it. You can get better or you can sulk, and there were days I sulked. It was tough. If you make something positive out of it, it can help you.’’\nChase Headley said Bird is better, too.\n“He’s a force right now,” said Headley, who also homered.\nBird told The Post in early March that he finally regained the feel to his swing, something that was lost when he hurt his shoulder in May 2015 and something he didn’t have even though he hit 11 home runs in 157 at-bats after being called up.\nBird AP Then came shoulder surgery in February 2016. A year lost, but something precious gained.\n“He looks really good,’’ Girardi said. “Knowing that he sat out a year, you worry about guy’s timing, hasn’t seemed to affect him.’’\nBird celebrated being named the first baseman with the two home runs, but he also made a couple of smooth plays at first. He is moving better, too.\n“It’s fun to be back playing. I feel good when I go home and the next day, so that’s nice,’’ Bird explained. “I didn’t have that for a long time. This offseason was cool because I wasn’t rehabbing.’’\nFollowing the Arizona Fall League, Bird realized he needed to work on getting stronger, not bulking up, adding real strength. He did all that and kept working on putting the barrel of the bat on the baseball.\nBat speed is one thing.\nBarrel accuracy is a beautiful thing.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:25:28.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
