King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted a day ago 6 Guitarist Gary Rossington - the only surviving original member of Lynyrd Skynyrd alongside band's early bassist Larry Junstrom - said he doesn't approve the idea of Skynyrd continuing once he's gone.The 65-year-old musician tells Guitar World : \"We'd have to have a meeting about it, but I don't think so. When there's not any originals left, it's pretty weird to still have band. I don't think nobody would do that but it's up to me, and Ronnie [Van Zant] and Allen [Collins]' estates I guess.\"Gary added: \"When we were growing up, our dream was to have a band that made it big like The Beatles. Nobody could be them, but our own American dream came true. We had a few different bass players and drummers and guitar players and they were great and contributed a lot, but me, Allen and Ronnie were the ones who dreamt it and who kept it going.\"It was a crazy idea and it's even crazier that we are still going. Our dream came true and then the crash ended it, but I'm not going to just walk away.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:28:47.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
