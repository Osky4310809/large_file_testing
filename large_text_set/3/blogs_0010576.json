AFP/Getty Images \nThe Government’s Brexit secretary is urging MPs to reject outright the House of Lords' proposed changes to the Brexit bill. \nDavid Davis has insisted he will ask the Commons to kick out the two amendments to the bill which were voted through by peers in recent weeks. \nThe Lords' two amendments guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in Britain and demand a parliamentary vote on Theresa May’s final exit deal. \nMPs will consider the amendments in the Commons on Monday. PM 'could trigger Article 50 to start Brexit divorce talks on Tuesday' \nAn overwhelming majority of peers backed the amendments and Labour has since made a “direct appeal” to the Prime Minister to let them go ahead. \nBut a defiant Mr Davis said voters want the Prime Minister to be able to get on with the job and said he will call on MPs to leave the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill untouched. \nThe Bill could complete its final stages on Monday and it is possible Article 50 could be triggered by Tuesday , sources told the Standard on Friday. \nMr Davis said: \"However they voted in the referendum, the majority of people now want the Prime Minister to be able to get on with the job. \n\"By a majority of four to one, MPs passed straightforward legislation allowing the Government to move ahead with no strings attached. I will be asking MPs to send the legislation back to the House of Lords in its original form so that we can start building a Global Britain and a strong new partnership with the EU. \n\"Our new position in the world means we can restore national self-determination, build new trading links and become even more global in spirit and action.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:38:39.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
