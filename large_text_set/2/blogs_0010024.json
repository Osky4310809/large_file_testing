The singer paired an all-black leather two-piece outfit, which has to be an ode to her duet with Metallica later tonight, with a super-long voluminous ponytail. She streaked her usual bleached blonde hair with trendiest hair color of the moment: blorange. ICYMI blorange is the hilariously clever name for the hair color combo of blood and orange. It's rose gold , which took over celebs's hair in 2016, with a hint of orange. Sure, you're probably thinking, \"Oh, that's just peach.\" However, if you take a look at Lady Gaga's ponytail, her colorful highlights don't quite resemble the fuzzy fruit that's been taking over our favorite eye shadow palettes lately and not quite pink. Alas, it's blorange. Trust us. And we're so here for it. It's almost like she ditched her pink hat in favor of some in her hair, but with a trendy twist. We love the blorange just as much as when she attended the Grammys in 2010 with yellow hair. But TBH Lady Gaga always slays on the red carpet, and this year is no different.
