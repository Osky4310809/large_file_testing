Here's everything you need to know about the sultry sequel, if you're thinking of seeing it or trying to avoid awkward conversations with your parents. When does it open? \nLike Fifty Shades of Grey , the film hits theaters Valentine's Day weekend, with preview screenings starting Thursday, Feb. 9 in select theaters. The film opens nationwide on Friday, Feb. 10. Hollywood will roll out the red carpet for a premiere of the film on Thursday, Feb. 2. You can see all the action on USA TODAY's Instagram Stories ( @usatoday ) and follow our reporters Carly Mallenbaum ( @thatgirlcarly ) and Andrea Mandell (@andreamandell ) on Twitter for live updates from the red carpet. Who's in it? \nDakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are reprising their roles as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Several supporting characters from the first film are back, including Marcia Gay Harden as Christian's mother and Victor Rasuk as Ana's friend José. \nThere are several new characters that will make an appearance, including Kim Basinger as Christian's ex Elena (who introduced him to BDSM), Bella Heathcote as his more recent ex, Leila, and Eric Johnson as Ana's new boss, Jack Hyde. What's it about? \nBased on the second novel in author E.L. James' trilogy, the movie will pick up where the first ended, with Ana and Christian apart. As they reconcile and try to make their, er, unconventional relationship work, Christian's exes and Anastasia's boss start making things difficult. Same sex, but now with more intrigue! You can see the \"darker\" approach in the trailers and clips released so far (these are all, obviously NSFW ).
