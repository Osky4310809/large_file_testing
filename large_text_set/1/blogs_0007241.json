The sex act is known as a golden shower and, if the reports are true, it means that Trump, who has been married three times to models and is known for rating women based on their looks, has a taste for kinky bedroom antics, something most of the nation probably had little interest in knowing about before this week. \nTrump allegedly has particular tastes in the sheets. He once paid prostitutes to pee on a bed that President Barack Obama and his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, had previously slept in at a luxury Moscow hotel, according to a 35-page document \"prepared for political opponents of Trump by a person who is understood to be a former British intelligence agent,\" Buzzfeed News reported. \nMic debated Tuesday whether just watching could really be considered playing an active role in the sexual fetish: \"Simply watching some people pee on a bed? That would seem to be a form of what could be called piss voyeurism — a cross-over sub-genre of two different fetishes. That, though, isn't the end of this: If the sex workers purportedly hired by Trump were on the bed and peeing on each other while Trump watched, that could indeed be considered a ''golden showers' (urination) show,'\" the site wrote. \nCosmopolitan interviewed men and women who enjoyed the act and they suggested you be more open minded about letting you partner pee on you. Yes, this is a thing. \n\"We both drink lots of water so that our bladders are full. Whether it happens before, during, or after sex depends on how full our bladders are. I also enjoy it when my partner urinates herself as I love seeing her clothing or panties get wet,\" one man told the site.

There was a whole \"Sex in the City\" plot line around golden showers in Season 3. And R&B crooner R. Kelly was once accused of having sex with a teenage girl and urinating in her mouth. \nSex columnist Dan Savage has also suggested that golden showers are not as repugnant as you might think, so, hey, maybe Trump is really just trying to make America great again, after all. \n\"Yes, yes, being into golden showers, or getting off on being pissed on, is pretty kinky, as kinks go. But after a few beers, piss is just so much hot water. I'm not saying you should've gone there for your ex, if pissing on him was something you absolutely, positively couldn't bring yourself to do. All I'm saying is that most people who give piss a chance quickly realize that golden showers aren't nearly as gross and disgusting—or even golden—as they were led to believe by people who lump piss in with shit when discussing and/or freaking out about other people's kinks,\" Savage wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:17:23.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
