The feature was first revealed several months ago and had already launched in some regions , but now the feature is rolling out globally.\nAs Instagram notes in the announcement post :\nTo go live, just swipe right from feed and choose Start Live Video in the camera. When you’re done, your live story will disappear from the app. You may also see Top Live on Explore, connecting you to exciting live stories happening now . \nInstagram Live will be available to all users in the coming days so long as you’re running version 10.0 or newer. As the premiere photo-sharing community on the web, Instagram has some stiff competition in the live streaming space from juggernauts like Snapchat and Facebook, and even Twitter has gotten in the live streaming game of late.\n \nDownload Instagram from Google Play \nRecent updates Hands-free mode and new stickers \nDecember 21: In this holiday-themed update to version 10.3, Instagram introduced several new features including a hands-free recording mode, more stickers and holiday content. The new camera interface lets users record a video by tapping the record button once, rather than pressing and holding it like previously. You can also now add customizable weather, time and location stickers to snaps. Limited-time-only Christmas-themed stickers and plans for New Year’s stickers were also announced.\nBookmarks \nDecember 14: Instagram now lets you save posts that you’d like to revisit later. You should see a new bookmark icon underneath each and every post in your feed. When you find a photo or video that you’d like to save, tap the bookmark icon, and that’s it. The post will be saved to a new, private tab on your profile, where you can see all the posts you’ve saved. The best part? Posts saved in your bookmarks tab are only visible to you.\nLive video streaming \nDecember 12: Instagram is the latest social networking giant to support live video streaming . Users can stream up to one hour of live video at a time, though video clips from the live streaming feature can’t be saved at this time. It’s only live in the US for now, but more regions will gain support for the feature soon.\nBoomerang videos and Story mentions \nNovember 10: Boomerang videos are now baked into the Instagram app . Just swipe right from the main feed page, select Boomerang , then you’ll be able to create short GIF-like clips that you can share directly to your account. In addition, Instagram has added support for mentioning users in Stories.\nSave posts as drafts \nSeptember 20: You can finally save Instagram posts as drafts . We’re not sure why this feature wasn’t available in previous versions, but we’re happy it’s here now.\nSee also: How to delete your Instagram account November 20, 2016 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T13:40:48.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
