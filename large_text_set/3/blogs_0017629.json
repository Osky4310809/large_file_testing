Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. About a half hour from Orlando, Wekiva Island is a low-key refuge from amusement park crowds. Orlando, Florida (CNN) There comes a point during any Orlando vacation when it's high time to ditch the masses and venture away from the theme parks. When that moment comes, there are plenty of side excursions that deliver a change of pace, whether it's signing yourself up for a hammock massage or mastering the trapeze. These activities provide a glimpse of another side of Orlando and the surrounding area -- one that comes with ample elbow room and has nothing to do with Mickey Mouse. Hammock therapy Read More Lounging in a hammock is always a smart idea. Snagging a massage while you're at it? Even better. The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes, offers a 70-minute hammock massage at the rooftop eco garden that will have you smiling and perhaps even snoozing. While the hammock sways back and forth, a therapist loosens up your lucky limbs and gives your feet a rub down. Post-massage, the spa mixologist whips up drinks made with fresh herbs from the garden, and the Vitale Spa Cafe has Mighty Green Smoothies and healthy bites on hand. $230 for 70-minute treatment \nThe Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes, 4012 Central Florida Parkway, Orlando, FL 32837-7662; Cabana refuge Comfy couch? Check. Adirondack chairs? Check. Coffee table? Check. A private cabana at Wekiva Island certainly has the creature comforts covered. About a half hour from Orlando, Wekiva Island is a recreational outpost along the Wekiva River in Longwood. Near the private cabanas, a wine bar serves up charcuterie boards and craft beer, and the cafe serves crowd pleasers like beef brisket and gator tacos. No need to move a muscle, though: service to the cabanas is speedy and frequent. When it's time to venture out, the Wekiva River is perfect for paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing or just taking a dip. The spring-fed water is 72 degrees all year long. And, yes, a gator sighting is nearly guaranteed. Cabanas start at $85/day. \nWekiva Island, 1014 Miami Springs Dr, Longwood, FL 32779-2214; Two-wheeled discovery Bike tours give visitors a taste of the quieter side of Orlando.

From June to late September, SoBe Surf in Merritt Island guides guests through the glowing waters via kayak or paddle board. The underwater fireworks show is all thanks to single-celled organisms called dinoflagellates that leave a swirl of blue as your paddle cuts through the water. Along the way, it's not uncommon for manatees to pop up alongside and say hello with a snort, not to mention the occasional shooting star, Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (which also light up blue) and the always-entertaining jumping mullet. $59/person for guided tours; $35/person for self-guided tours A taste of Broadway On the outside, the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts , which opened in late 2015, is sleek and sophisticated.
