Image copyright EPA Image caption Van Gogh Museum Director Axel Ruger and Culture Minister Jet Bussemaker have welcomed the artworks' return \nHe told a documentary to be aired later that he found it \"trivially easy\" to break in to the museum. \n\"The heist took about three minutes and 40 seconds,\" Durham says in the film, the New York Times reported. \"When I was done, the police were there, and I was passing by with my getaway car. Took my ski mask off, window down, and I was looking at them.\" \nHe said he and his accomplice had wanted to steal Sunflowers but the artwork was too well guarded, Trouw newspaper reported. They then turned their attention to The Potato Eaters, considered the painter's first masterpiece, but decided it was too big to fit through the hole they had entered through. \nDurham told the filmmakers he had selected the seascape because the thick paint convinced him it would be valuable. He was arrested a year later in the Spanish resort of Marbella and convicted in 2005, but had until now maintained he was innocent. \nThe theft was a case of \"art-napping\" by an opportunist burglar, art investigator Arthur Brand told the BBC. Image copyright Van Gogh museum Image caption Van Gogh's father was a minister at the Reformed Church in Nuenen \n\"No art collector will pay for stolen art they can't display,\" he said. But stolen art could be used as leverage by criminals who offer its return in exchange for reduced sentences for their crimes. \nDutch criminal Cor van Hout - who became notorious for kidnapping the beer tycoon Freddy Heineken for an estimated $10m (£8m) ransom in 1983 - wanted to buy them but he was gunned down in a gangland hit before the deal could be done. \nAnother potential buyer met the same fate and the paintings were eventually sold to Raffaele Imperiale, a low-ranking mafioso who was at the time running an Amsterdam coffee shop. \nImperiale paid about €350,000 ($380,000; £305,000) for the paintings and his lawyers told the New York Times he had bought them because he was \"fond of art\" and they were a \"bargain\". Mafia exposed as artful dodgers \nImperiale was among several suspected dealers arrested by Italian police last January. Another suspected dealer arrested at the same time reportedly told investigators the paintings were at Imperiale's house. \nThe BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says mafia members are not known for their understated good taste and raids have often revealed a preference for ostentatious, kitsch decoration, so Imperiale was unlikely to have bought the paintings for display purposes. Image copyright EPA Image caption Italian police recovered the paintings last September \nThey were found wrapped in cloth in a safe in a house in the picturesque seaside town of Castellammare di Stabia, near Pompeii, last September. \nVan Gogh Museum Director Axel Ruger said it was wonderful to have the works back on display. \n\"I think it's one of the most joyous days in my career really,\" he said. \nThe museum has not made any comment on the upcoming documentary, Trouw said. Why are the paintings significant? \nVincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) is widely considered the greatest Dutch artist after Rembrandt. \nSeascape at Scheveningen was one of only two seascapes he painted while he lived in the Netherlands. Image copyright EPA Image caption Van Gogh painted Seascape at Scheveningen on a gusty day and grains of sand were embedded in the wet paint \nIt shows a foaming, stormy sea and thundery sky, and was painted in 1882 while he was staying in The Hague. \nCongregation Leaving the Reformed Church at Nuenen (1884) was painted for Van Gogh's mother, but also partly for his father, who had become a pastor at the church in 1882. When his father died in 1884, Van Gogh added churchgoers, including a few women wearing shawls used for mourning. \nVan Gogh committed suicide in France in 1890.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:00:25.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
