But recently, I watched Good Mythical Morning's Longest Lasting Lipstick Test video instead. In one of their latest YouTube posts, Rhett and Link, the co-hosts of the daily show, took a break from seeing whether fish-sperm dumplings and haggis cookies are edible to channel their inner Manny Gutierrez and James Charles . Yesterday, they uploaded a video of themselves putting two popular lipsticks through a series of tests to see which one is truly longer-wearing. Considering the latest buzz on boy beauty , it's no surprise that Rhett and Link, two men who don't typically wear makeup, would enter the conversation in their own way. One of their viewers actually asked if there are any kissproof lipsticks. To that, Rhett responded in the video, saying, \"You could have asked anyone on the Internet this question, and you chose us—wise choice.\" He's right...ish. A quick search on allure.com would have brought up our story on the apocalypse-proof liquid lipstick , just saying. However, watching the Good Mythical Morning dudes test out a selection of liquid lipsticks is a probably more entertaining way to get an answer.

Rhett, on the other hand, tested out the Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick (an Allure editor favorite worth double the price of Maybelline). As for how they truly tested the lipsticks for long wear, Rhett and Link placed them into real-life date scenarios. The first test was the Dinner Date: Both chowed down on a BBQ sauce-slathered rack of ribs. TBH, that test alone would have sufficed. They did three more tests, though, including dunking their heads in a bucket of water, smooching a mannequin, and rubbing their faces on pillows. You can watch the Good Mythical Morning's Longest Lasting Lipstick Test video below to find out which lipstick withstood Rhett and Link's tests best. We really hope you don't pull anything from laughing too hard.
