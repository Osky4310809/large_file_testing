Edgard Arevalo noted the successful security operations implemented during the Black Nazarene procession and the preparations made by security forces ahead of the religious event. \n“We like to make it as a template. If I may say, we will recommend it to the Philippine National Police (PNP) to make it a template during the ASEAN summit launching and the holding of the Miss Universe pageant,” Arevalo said. \nThe military will be playing, like it did during the Black Nazarene procession, an active support role to the PNP in securing the two international events that will be held in various areas of the country, including Davao City. \nASEAN member-representatives will be converging on Sunday in Davao City for the launch of the country’s hosting of the summit slated in November. \nThe candidates of the Miss Universe pageant are also expected to visit Davao City as part of the activities of the global event.
