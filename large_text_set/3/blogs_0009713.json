(Photo:IE) \nThe three corner contest in Punjab’s Gurdaspur is making it an interesting battle. Former Aam Aadmi Party Punjab convenor Sucha Singh Chhotepur is fighting elections from this constituency. The leader, who is fighting on the ticket of newly formed Apna Punjab Party, is facing tough contest from AAP’s Amarjit Singh Chahal and SAD’s Gurbachan Singh Babehali. After being sacked on corruption charges from Aam Aadmi Party, Chhotepur floated his own party named Aapna Punjab Party with himself as its convener. Whili floating the party, Chotepur said that his regional party was the “need of the hour” after national parties like Congress , BJP , AAP and regional party SAD “failed” to take care of the interest of Punjab. Gurdaspur is constituency No. 4 of Punjab legislative assembly. It is situated in Gurdaspur district and comes under the Lok Sabha constituency that goes by the same name. Gurdaspur is an unreserved assembly constituency. \nWho all are contesting:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:12:11.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
