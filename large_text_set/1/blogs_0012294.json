The smartphone was released last October. The smallest ZenFone 3 (5.2-inch) is available for an official price of $149.00. It’s big brother (the 5.5-inch Deluxe), which is the model that we tested, is priced at $369.00. \nThe ZenFone 3 comes in three other versions: The ZenFone 3 Ultra which has 4GB of RAM, a 6.8-inch IPS screen and a 4,600mAh battery. We don't have word on a US release price yet. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe which has 6GB of RAM, a 5.7-inch Full-HD screen and 128GB of internal memory is $499. The ZenFone 3 Max which has 2/3GB of RAM (depending on the model), a 5.2-inch screen and 16/32GB of internal memory ASUS ZenFone 3 design and build quality \nAsus has raised the bar in terms of build quality with this device. Firstly, the Taiwanese firm opted for more high quality materials as the ZenFone 3 is made from glass and metal. The smartphone is similar to the Galaxy S6 but, of course, it’s impossible to confuse the two as the manufacturers have both placed their logos on the devices. As you can imagine, the phone is prone to getting covered in fingerprints. The ZenFone 3 has a more premium feel than its predecessor. © AndroidPIT \nYes, the design is classic, but great progress has been made with the finish. The feel of the phone is pleasant, the fittings are secure (no grinding or popping) and the screws are well hidden. In short, Asus has done a great job and the device has nothing to fear from its competitors. \nRegarding the ZenFone 2, the smartphone also succeeded in achieving finesse and it’s even better with the new device. However, the handling isn’t exactly easy. The corners aren’t rounded and this can affect the user’s experience with the smartphone. Some thicker and bigger smartphones avoid giving this sensation. The front panel shows up fingerprints. © AndroidPIT \nThe front panel is dominated by the screen but the body-screen ratio doesn’t feature among the best on the market (only 70 percent). This space is quite limited because of the three buttons at the bottom. Regarding these buttons, contrary to Samsung smartphones, Asus had the good idea to use Android logic (return button on the left, multitasking on the right). The volume and power buttons are found on the right side of the device. © AndroidPIT \nA fingerprint reader is featured on the back panel. This button isn’t circular, but rather, rectangular. This sets it apart from its competitors. In practice, it is very efficient and quick. It can also be used to fulfill other actions, like returning calls or taking a photo. Just like the Galaxy S6, the camera lens slightly protrudes from the device. © AndroidPIT \nAbove the fingerprint reader, you’ll find the camera. It slightly protrudes from the device (which obviously makes it similar to the Galaxy S6) and will affect the smartphone’s stability when resting on a flat surface. A two-tone LED flash and an autofocus phase detection are also integrated into the phone. \nIn general, the ZenFone 3 is a seductive smartphone but it’s not original. Its top of the range design will please the public. ASUS ZenFone 3 display \nAs explained previously, the ZenFone 3 is available in two screen sizes: 5.2 and 5.5 inches. I tested the larger version. It has Full-HD (1,080 x 1,920) definition with 401ppi pixel density. Only the VR lovers will notice the lack of QHD definition. If that’s the case for you, I advise you to opt for another model. As for screen protection, the device has 2.5D Gorilla Glass. The ZenFone 3’s screen is extremely bright \nThe display impressed me during my test. It’s very bright. Readability is excellent and the IPS screen offers an excellent contrast. The ZenFone 3 deals very well with outdoor lighting. Reflections are rare and you aren’t bothered by messages popping up on the smartphone. The ZenFone 3’s screen is extremely bright. © AndroidPIT \nFinally, the only criticism that can be made about the device is its color temperature. Naturally, the colors lean towards blue. This is particularly noticeable for white. I advise you to change this in the settings to choose the “Balanced” mode. I advise you to modify the colorimetry on the ZenFone 3 to improve the display. © AndroidPIT \nIn general, the ZenFone 3’s screen was a delight. It was simple enough to manually change the white balance to benefit from its full potential. ASUS ZenFone 3 software \nMoving on to a topic of much debate: the smartphone’s software interface, particularly its ZenUI 3.0 launcher. Asus is part of a group of manufacturers that like to completely modify the Android interface. On the ZenFone 3, I found this to be its weakest point. I think that ZenUI still has a long road ahead. Asus still provides their application for “optimizing resources”. © AndroidPIT \nAlthough the smartphone uses Android Marshmallow 6.0.1, there are few differences with ZenUI running with Lollipop. Although Asus decreased the number of pre-installed applications (even though 64GB of internal memory is enough to store all the Asus and Google applications), the majority of them can only be deactivated and not deleted. As a user, I would like to be able to use my system freely and to delete anything that I don’t want on my device. The ZenFone 3 has a lot of bloatware. © AndroidPIT \nBut what annoyed me the most is the large amount of functions and applications made by Asus that aren’t useful. Particularly certain applications for clean-up and optimization, which uses up storage space and spams us with daily notifications. You have to go to settings and deactivate them so you’re not continually bothered by them. Asus still provides their application for “optimizing resources”. © AndroidPIT ASUS ZenFone 3 performance \nThe ZenFone 3 has a mid-range processor: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625. Actually, it’s not correct to consider it as a mid-range processor because Qualcomm does all they can to offer more RAM and connectivity. \nThe ZenFone 3 is available in two versions: one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory, the other with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory. Our test model was the version with 4GB of RAM. \nThe difference with the ZenFone 2 is obvious, as it used an Intel Z3580/Z3560 chip with 2GB of RAM and less internal memory. The performance is good and I didn’t notice many bugs or slowing down. It’s far from the performance of a Galaxy S7 but the phone handles multitasking well. The ZenFone 3 perfectly meets the expectations of the average user. \nHere’s the average benchmark results obtained by the ZenFone 3 in our benchmark tests: Geekbench 4.0 single-core", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T00:12:25.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
