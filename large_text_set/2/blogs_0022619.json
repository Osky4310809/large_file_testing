Sources told ET Now, “Size of Infosys buyback likely to be over $2.5 billion and the official buyback announcement will be likely in April”. Sources alos revealed that Infosys founders have agreed on share buyback and they will not oppose it. “The board has given nod to adopt new Articles of Association to incorporate buyback,” they told the business news channel. Infosys – India’s second largest information technology services company – has cash worth Rs 38,000 crore on its books, which it may find difficult to deploy in an acquisition. \nHailing TCS buyback earlier this month, TV Mohandas Pai on Thursday said “I hope that Infosys follows suit and announces share buyback.” “If Cognizant and TCS can buyback shares, why not Infosys?” he added. Earlier last month, Infosys reported its consolidated net profit for the third quarter of the current financial year 2016-17 rose 2.3% on-quarter to Rs 37.08 billion, beating most analyst estimates and sending shares soaring. Its consolidated revenue for the Oct-Dec quarter was almost flat at Rs 172.73 billion, down 0.2% from the previous quarter.
