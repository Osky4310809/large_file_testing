Spicer covered a lot of ground . He talked ISIS and trade agreements. He told the press “our intention is never to lie to you,” but he also said sometimes we can disagree with facts; and he attempted to shame the press for hurting the president’s feelings.\nOne thing he didn’t touch on, though, was a strange, long-running one-sided Twitter feud with Dippin’ Dots. Yes, that Dippin’ Dots—the “ice cream of the future.”\nwe may not have inauguration attendance data yet, but one set of record turnout numbers are in:\nSean spicer’s angry dippin dots twetes pic.twitter.com/KSXlXLLEeB \n— ಠ_ಠ (@MikeIsaac) January 22, 2017 \n\nThose are jut a few of Spicer’s many tweets aimed at insulting the company. We may never know exactly why Spicer hated the tiny ice cream balls so vehemently, but those five years of tweets did not go unnoticed by the company itself. And Dippin’ Dots CEO chose Monday, the same day as the press conference, to publish an open letter to Spicer on their website .\nGrab some Dippin’ Dots and join me in this fantastic shade.\nDear Sean,\nWe understand that ice cream is a serious matter. And running out of your favorite flavor can feel like a national emergency! We’ve seen your tweets and would like to be friends rather than foes. After all, we believe in connecting the dots.\nIt’s got to be embarrassing when an ice cream company is calling you out over your Twitter tantrums. But not only did they take the high road when it comes to civil communication, they schooled him on what their company actually provides.\nAs you may or may not know, Dippin’ Dots are made in Kentucky by hundreds of hard working Americans in the heartland of our great country. As a company, we’re doing great. We’ve enjoyed double-digit growth in sales for the past three years. That means we’re creating jobs and opportunities. We hear that’s on your agenda too.\nOh wow, never mind that first paragraph. This is embarrassing—having an ice cream company shame the White House Press Secretary for focusing more on ice cream than on American industry and human jobs.\nNow, some of you might be trying to cut Spicer some slack, since he wasn’t working in the White House when he was sending those angry tweets. He started this weird feud nearly seven years ago. Sure, maybe he’s changed, and grown as a person!\nBut he only stopped sending these tweets less than a year and a half ago. So let’s ask ourselves: do we really want the primary liason between our president and the press to be less than a year and a half out from dedicating his time to complaining publicly about vanilla ice cream?\nAt least we have Dippin’ Dots to look to for maturity in these situations. The CEO, “Scott,” offered to treat the White House and press corps to an ice cream social. He says they can “afford to.” You know, because the company is doing so well, despite one certain Press Secretary’s half-decade spent trying to take them down.\nAs far as dessert-based burns go, that one’s pretty solid.\n \n(image via Facebook)\nWant more stories like this?
