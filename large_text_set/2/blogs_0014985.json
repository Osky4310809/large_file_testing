What the manager is asking particular players to do is the difference and that's why Stones needs a Vincent Kompany next to him because the centre-halves he is playing with are not experienced enough in this country. \n\"He hasn't set the world alight, nor has Nicolas Otamendi, but if Kompany had been fit enough to play alongside him, it would have helped him and guided him because he is still a young player coming into a new team.\" \nParallels have been drawn between Ferdinand and Stones – both gifted, ball-playing defenders who attracted early career criticism for playing their way into tricky situations. \nFerdinand smoothed out the rough edges of his game at United to become one of the world's premier centre-backs but he wonders whether Guardiola's expansive style at City will allow Stones to make similar adjustments. \n\"When you go to a big club for big money, it isn't easy,\" he said, having become the most expensive footballer in Britain when he moved from Leeds United to Old Trafford in 2002. \n\"At United, I went into a team where everyone knew their roles, but it was still a challenge for me. The problem is that I went there thinking about how many skills I could do on a pitch rather than clean sheets. \nGuardiola: Bravo was brilliant \n\"I think Stones is still having more concerns about the football side of the game rather than defensively. They have more of the ball than teams they play against too, so there is a lot of information to take in if you are a Pep Guardiola centre-half - things like splitting to get the ball and then, 'What is the next phase after that?' \n\"At United, I toned my game down rather than being on the front foot. It was more about my first thought being 'clean sheet, where are we defensively, concentration, etc.,' then the football stuff came naturally. \n\"But I think Pep asks more of his centre-halves on the ball than in the teams I played in, so it is a big ask and it is harder because of that. My position when I didn't have the ball was to be in a position to stop the counterattack, whereas it seems Pep Guardiola says and wants differently.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T12:29:04.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
