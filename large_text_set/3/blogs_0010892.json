I bet most of people are Angelina fans who are just upset to see Brad and Jennifers picture. They were a lovely Hollywood couple, theyare not together anymore but their relationships we be always remebered/ msshellokitty 5 years I agree..Please get rid of the anon post.I have not posted in a very long time because the site is just not the same anymore.I bet a lot of loyal people are gone.I enjoyed getting points,playing the games,etc.I don't get why there are so many hostile anon post now.
