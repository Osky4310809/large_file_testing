No specific financial details have been disclosed at this point, and the deal officially closed on Friday, January 27, 2017.\nYou’re probably wondering what this all means for the Nextbit Robin and for the future of the company. Tom Moss, CEO and co-founder of Nextbit, explained in a blog post that the company has indeed stopped selling the Robin smartphone and all accessories through its official channels, and that they’ll continue to fulfill warranties for 6 more months. Nextbit Robin devices will also continue to receive software updates and security patches through February 2018.\n“[Razer are] rebels like us, they speak from the heart, and they share our need to push boundaries,” says Moss. “Nextbit will operate as an independent division inside Razer, focused on unique mobile design and experiences. To put it simply, we’ll be doing exactly what we’ve been doing all along, only bigger and better.”\nMoss has yet to comment on any new products that are coming down the pipeline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:42:00.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
