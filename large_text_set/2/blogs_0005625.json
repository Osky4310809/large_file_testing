She was born into a farming family in Nuwakot, a district north west of Kathmandu, Nepal, the fifth child of seven siblings. \n“My father always wanted a daughter because he had four sons before that. I was also born as a boy,” Ms. Lama, who was named as Nabin Wabia, said. \n“But as I kept growing, my behavior started changing. I started behaving like a girl. I was dressed like a boy. So everyone in the family and in the village started teasing me. I felt mentally tortured. I used to wonder, ‘Why am I like this?’” she said.

That people like me are called transgenders,” she said. Then in 2009, she was featured on the front of the Voice of Women, a Nepalese magazine and her modeling career began. \n“As I kept modelling, I came to be known as Nepal’s first transgender model,” she said. \nThings still weren’t easy. Ms. Lama found herself being rejected by casting agents. ENLARGE A makeup artist appliedeye-shadow on Anjali Lama at Lakme Fashion week in Mumbai, India, Feb. 1, 2017.

But I kept trying,” she said. \nIt was during Ms. Lama’s third try that she was successful in securing a place on the catwalk. Last week in Mumbai, she walked on runways for Indian designers including Tarun Tahiliani and Anita Dongre. \n“I think the acceptance hasn’t been full. It is just the beginning,” she said. “I think some transgender people are feeling more empowered than before.” \nFor breaking news, features and analysis from India, follow WSJ India on Facebook .
