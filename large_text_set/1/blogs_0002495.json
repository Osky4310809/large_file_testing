All these years, celebrities have brought their A-games to KWK creating episodes that have been gloriously sharp and witty. Through the course of the show, as time has passed, people have changed, relationship statuses have changed and so has the colour of the coffee cup in the show (it is not red any more.) So let's have a look at some of the moments on that infamous couch that'll never be repeated again! \n1. Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta were really good friends and had done several films together. The two appeared together on the first season of Koffee With Karan . In that episode, Preity Zinta had expressed her displeasure about Kareena Kapoor, and how she was spreading the word that she refused Kal Ho Na Ho and hence Preity was signed for the film. Well, now that Saif is very much married to Kareena, we bet Preity's never going to say that around him ever again! \n2. In Season 2, Shahid Kapoor came on with his now ex-girlfriend Kareena Kapoor, and later Bebo's sister Karisma Kapoor joined in. Coming back to the present, we know the Shahid and Kareena aren't together and are happy in their respective married life. \n3. Hrithik Roshan and Suzzane Khan were one of the most loved couples in Bollywood. In the past seasons, they came together on the show. Now that the couple called it quits in 2016, we don't think we will (EVER) see them again together on Koffee With Karan. \n4. In first season, Bollywood hit couples, Shah Rukh Khan came on with wife Gauri Khan and Hrithik Roshan had Suzzane. They were known to be best friends and a squad, who would regularly hangout together. That was in 2004. In 2016, the two superstars don't mingle well. And now that Kaabil and Raees are competing at the box-office... \n5. In Season 2, Bipasha Basu and John Abraham had come together on the show. After dating for almost a decade, the couple broke up in 2011. We don't think we will see this couple on that couch again. \n6. Actress Priyanka Chopra featured with Deepika Padukone as the two were working together on the film Bajirao Mastani . The two were like a house on fire in that Season 4 episode. After the release of Bajirao Mastani and now that the two are pursuing their Hollywood career, many smell competition between them. Rumours say that the two are not friends anymore and don't like to cross each other's paths. \n7. Shahid Kapoor has appeared on Koffee With Karan with almost all his alleged girlfriends. After breaking up with Kareena Kapoor, Shahid came on with his rumoured girl Priyanka Chopra on Season 3. \nLater, there were rumours that Sasha broke up with PeeCee and was dating Sonakshi Sinha. And then those two appeared together on Season 4. \nIn 2016, Shahid Kapoor who is married to Mira Rajput, came with his wife on KWK season five. We smell a pattern?
