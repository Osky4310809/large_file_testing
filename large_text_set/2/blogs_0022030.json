LA Galaxy II will host tryouts in England Kelvin Kuo 0 Feb 22, 2017 21:35:32 The USL side is hoping to find hidden talent in the UK by giving players an opportunity to showcase their skills in front of their technical staff \nIn an effort to expand their recruiting pool and discover players for the 2017 USL season, LA Galaxy II will host an open tryout this summer in England. \nWatch: Giovinco hits a stunner \nThe Los Angeles-based second-division club is offering footballers a chance to play professionally by signing a contract with Los Dos. At least five players will be selected at the end of each session, with 10 hopefuls having an opportunity to train at the StubHub Center for a week-long trial. \n\"We are looking forward to seeing new players in England and have organized this event to expand our efforts to identify talents,\" said LA Galaxy II head coach Mike Munoz. \n\"We hope to find young, talented players that can enter our organization through Galaxy II and work their way up to the first team. Scouting for Galaxy II will give us a chance to evaluate numerous players, including hidden gems that may not have agents, players without a fair chance in the past, first time pros, or young pros who are not under contract. \n\"We want to make sure that everyone has a fair opportunity to be evaluated and earn a professional contract on our 2017 LA Galaxy II roster.\" \nTryouts will be held in London at The Hive on May 31 and June 1, and again in Manchester at University of Manchester Armitage Sports Centre on June 3 and 4. To participate players must be between the ages of 18 and 26, and willing to pay $185 to give it a shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:02:47.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
