Despite recent bomb blasts, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) remained firm on their decision to host the summit clash in Lahore. That bold step led the likes of Kevin Pietersen, Rilee Roussow, Luke Wright, Tymal Mills and Nathan McCullum pulling out and refusing to travel to Pakistan on security grounds. \nPlaying their second final in as many years, the Gladiators will take field with a revamped side, having roped in Anamul Haque of Bangladesh, South Africa's Morne van Wyk, Elton Chigumbura and Sean Ervine from Zimbabwe, and West Indies' Rayad Emrit as replacements. \nHowever, four of them - Haque, van Wyk, Chigumbura and Erive - are slated to join the team only on the morning of the final on Sunday (March 5), while the work is in progress to ensure that allrounder Emrit too joins the squad before the finale that starts at 8PM local time. Team's mentor Viv Richards and fielding coach Julien Fountain too are expected to arrive in the city early on Sunday morning. \n\"KP, Luke, Rilee, Mills would have been great but we respect their decision,\" Gladiators said in a statement. \"We are still confident of winning the PSL final despite missing the big stars. For our local players, playing at home is a huge opportunity. The experience of playing in front of the home crowd is massive, and all of them are excited about it.\" \nApart from the five new and forced acquisitions, Gladiators have also added Aizaz Cheema to the squad as the replacement for injured Umar Gul. The local players of the team are already in Lahore, sweating it out at the National Cricket Academy ahead of the title clash, \nMeanwhile the other finalists, Peshawar Zalmi, are still unsure of which of their foreign players will fly in for the contest. Captain Darren Sammy is expected to travel, despite sidestepping questions regarding the same after his team's win over Karachi Kings on Friday. While the participation of Marlon Samuels and Dawid Malan is all but confirmed, question marks remain over whether the ECB will give Chris Jordan the green signal to make the trip. Nottinghamshire have already declined Samit Patel's request for NOC. \nThe final is expected to be played out in front of a packed house, with an estimate of 18,000 tickets being sold ahead of the game. PCB has also ensured extra security, reportedly covering as far as a two-kilometer stretch around the venue. The governing body upheld its decision to stage the final in Lahore to showcase that Pakistan is safe to welcome back international cricket on its soil. Since the militant attack on Sri Lanka's team bus outside the Gaddafi Stadium in 2009, only Zimbabwe and Afghanistan have visited the country. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T15:54:50.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
