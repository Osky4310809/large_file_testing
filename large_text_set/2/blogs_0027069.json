After winning the award for Best Actress (and getting a smooch from Leonardo DiCaprio , which might be even more legendary), Stone was caught on video just trying to figure out where the heck she had to go. Then she ran into Brie Larson, who had miraculously found her friend in the gaggle of reporters and flashing lights.\nYou can see Stone’s face totally relax when she realizes who it was tapping her arm — just like when you catch your friend’s eye at a party you’re getting sick of and see that she has an empty seat next to her. Larson congratulated her friend, and then they hug it out for a solid minute or two. Something clicked, because Stone just starts bawling. “Now I cry,” she joked as the two were whisked away to some other backstage engagement.\nStone had gotten through her speech onstage and the statement she gave to reporters backstage (as one does) without any waterworks, but friends have a way of getting right to you. See? Don’t you want to talk to your best friend now? Tag ’em in a meme, send a text message, tell them that you love them like Brie Larson and Emma Stone love each other.\nBrie Larson congratulates Emma Stone backstage and Emma starts crying #Oscars pic.twitter.com/AEI12xbK8F \n— dalila (@HeytheredaIiIah) February 27, 2017 Stone had been dying for a hug as soon as her name was called, she even said so in her acceptance speech . She thanked co-star Ryan Gosling for “making her laugh” and then addressed the crew and friends saying,\n“I’m going to hug the hell out of you when the feeling reenters my body.” She’s kept her word. Stone also said in her speech, “I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do and this [Oscar statuette] is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey and I’m so grateful for that. So thank you so much, thank you.” Gracious as ever. \nThe night got even more intense for Stone and her La La Land crew after the insane mix up with Moonlight actually winning Best Picture. Although you can tell from the GIFs and videos that Gosling and Stone were bummed not to have won the honor, Stone kept her cool with reporters about the whole debacle. She told reporters backstage that she “f-cking loves Moonlight .” Stone added, “I think we all would have loved to win Best Picture, but we are so excited for Moonlight. I think it is one of the best films of all time, so I was pretty beside myself.”\nShe managed to keep her cool about Moonlight (because of course it was worthy of the award), but if she had to get a little petty in private at the after party with Larson, we won’t judge her.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:00:03.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
