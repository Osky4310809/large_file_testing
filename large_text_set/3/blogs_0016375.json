In England and Wales the decline has been dramatic: since the mid-1990s the number of offences has fallen by half. Vehicle theft has dropped by 86% since 1995 and burglaries by 71%. The most reliable measure of lawbreaking, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, is based on the experiences of victims, rather than perpetrators. But evidence from elsewhere suggests that within the broader decline in lawbreaking is another even more striking one: crime committed by young people.\nThe number of youngsters aged between ten (the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales) and 17 entering the criminal-justice system for the first time has tumbled, down by 84% since 2006. By contrast, the numbers of adults has declined by just 46%. Those numbers partly reflect the fact that the police have abandoned performance targets that had encouraged them to pick up misbehaving youngsters; catching spray-painting teenagers is easier than nabbing burglars. But the decrease has been so dramatic that it almost certainly points to children being more law-abiding today than they used to be. Other measures support this thesis. According to the victims of violence interviewed for the crime survey, between 2006 and 2016 the proportion who thought their attacker was aged 16 or under fell by almost half, from 14% to 8%. And between 2012 and 2015 the proportion of pupils at secondary schools were who temporarily suspended fell from 8.3% to 7.5%. Declines in the numbers of youngsters arrested have been seen in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and America.\nLatest updates Podcast: What are the economics of art? International an hour ago Why   See all updates Youngsters have become more law-abiding for similar reasons as their elders. Items that they used to steal, such as televisions and car radios, have fallen in value so nicking them is no longer worthwhile. Security measures such as burglar alarms have made it harder to break into houses. Central locking makes stealing cars trickier. Better and smarter policing has helped too. But some factors may have helped to drive down crime among young people specifically. In particular, they are living more abstemiously. The proportion of children who said that they had ever experimented with drugs fell by half between 2001 and 2014. Among adults, the figure barely shifted. In 2014 just 38% of 11-15 year-olds admitting to having tried alcohol. In 1988 over 60% said that they had tried drinking.\nThis more sober lifestyle affects crime rates in three ways, argues Tim Bateman of the University of Bedfordshire. Less drug-taking means less law-breaking to fund purchases. Crimes related to the possession and acquisition of drugs decline. And children are less likely to commit crimes when they are not drunk or high. Technology may also be helping to make the world less crime-ridden. Hours spent on computers and smartphones mean fewer opportunities to get up to no good. According to a study in 2012 by researchers from the London School of Economics, British children spend more time online and start going online at an earlier age than the European average. These trends bode well for the future: research shows that law-abiding children are more likely turn into law-abiding adults.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:04:33.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
