Image caption Owen Smith said rebelling over Article 50 was a \"big deal\" for him \nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales, Pontypridd MP Owen Smith said: \"I haven't changed my view that this [Brexit] is going to make us worse off in this country, going to make people in Pontypridd poorer, to make our politics meaner.\" \nThe former Labour leadership challenger said his decision was a \"big deal\" for him as he had never voted against the whip before. \n\"I think we are in the wrong place on this vote, and I think history will show that we are in the wrong place on it,\" he said. \nWhen it was pointed out that a majority of voters in Rhondda Cynon Taf voted against remaining in the EU, Mr Smith said there were not specific numbers for how his Pontypridd constituency voted. \nHe said one academic study from the University of East Anglia suggested that Pontypridd voted 55% to stay. Image caption Albert Owen said he had to respect the vote to leave the European Union \nHis Labour colleague Albert Owen said he would be voting to trigger Article 50. \nHe said it was a \"very difficult decision\" but added: \"At the end of the day the people of Ynys Mon and the people of Wales, and the UK, voted to leave the European Union. \n\"Seventeen million people voted to leave. It's not what I wanted, but its what I have to respect and accept\", he said.
