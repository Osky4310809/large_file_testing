Robart considers a legal challenge filed by the attorney general, Ferguson's office said. \n\"The state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,\" Robart said in issuing the restraining order Friday. \n\n\"Judge Robart's decision, effective immediately, effective now, puts a halt to President Trump's unconstitutional and unlawful executive order,\" Ferguson said. \n\n\"It puts a stop to it immediately, nationwide.\" \nHowever, while this appears a major victory for anti-Trump-ers, a Department of Homeland Security official told NBC News that the judge's order will have no immediate practical effect. \nAll previously issued visas from the seven affected countries were canceled by last week's executive order, the official said, meaning people would have to reapply. \nFurthermore, the Trump administration could seek a stay of the Seattle judge's order. \nThe decision came on a day that attorneys from four states were in courts challenging Trump's executive order. Trump's administration justified the action on national security grounds, but opponents labeled it an unconstitutional order targeting people based on religious beliefs - which the Boston judge has since ruled invalid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:25:57.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
