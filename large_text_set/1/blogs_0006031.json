Huwag mag-panic, kasi 'yun ang nakadagdag ng mga hindi magandang nagyayari sa atin during the activities,\" Conde said. \n(If an untoward incident happens, follow the orders of authorities deployed to the area. Don't panic because it worsens the situation.) \nAccording to the NDRRMC, response assets and personnel have been prepositioned to respond to any emergency that might occur particularly during the Traslacion. \nThe deployment includes an air ambulance, a search and rescue helicopter, two water search and rescue teams, two collapsed structure search and rescue teams, two urban search and rescue teams, 8 ambulances, 3 fire trucks with fire suppression teams, 40 motorcycle riders, and a communication van. \nMore than 5,700 law enforcers have been deployed to secure devotees. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
