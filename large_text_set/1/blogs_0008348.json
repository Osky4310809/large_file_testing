This is a video of him and my mate Al trying to get it off!” \nRELATED: How to do winter on two wheels \nAs seen in the clip, Al and Paul’s efforts to extricate the bike from the charged fence took more then three minutes, involved the use of a large stick, elicited a bunch of swearing and resulted in the camera man nearly dying from laughter right at the 1:15-mark. \nEnjoy laughing at their misfortune, and remember, stay safe out on the trails.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:19:55.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
