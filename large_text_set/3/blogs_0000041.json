Handle currently tops out at around 9MPH.\nWhile Handle might look a little awkward, it’s actually incredibly nimble. Changes in terrain, uneven surfaces, inclines, and even small jumps are no problem at all. Oh, and it can jump, too… so don’t go thinking that your minimal parkour skills will help you evade Handle.\n\nHandle’s front legs can carry a 50kg load, or, in all likelihood, stomp down on you with the force of Thor’s hammer as a reminder that you shouldn’t have been running away from it in the first place.\nThat’s not what Handle is built for, thankfully. Given its ability to stand upright and carry heavy loads, Handle would be an excellent warehouse or factory worker or even a horrifying stand-in for the UPS guy. It could even recharge in the back of the truck after running a parcel to the door.\nHere’s how you know that Handle is a truly creepy creation. Company founder Marc Raibert himself called Handle a “nightmare-inducing robot” during a presentation earlier this month. When that’s how the company founder feels about one of their creations, it’s hard not to agree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T15:01:59.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
