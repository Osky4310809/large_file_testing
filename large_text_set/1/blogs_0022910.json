(Gregg Vigliotti/For New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, January 28, 2017, 7:42 PM \nWhen a pair of would-be bank robbers walked into a Chase branch in Queens, gun in hand — they thought they had the heist under control. \nThat’s because they didn’t bank on a crew of johnny-on-the-spot cops. \n\"It was something you’d see in a movie and I was like, ‘Oh my god this is real,’” Police Officer Keith Gordon, 27, said about the heart-pounding arrest at the Chase bank on Union Turnpike near Utopia Parkway in Fresh Meadows. \n“It was definitely the first bank robbery that I stopped,” he said. \nCops search for Queens thief responsible for multiple bank heists \nIt was a high-stakes holdup from the start, officials said. \nThe two thieves, ages 36 and 40, entered the bank — part of the Utopia Center — about 9:15 a.m., just after the branch had opened, and immediately pulled a .45-caliber pistol on the four employees inside, police said. \nAs the two thieves went behind the counter and started packing up the loot, someone called 911, sending Gordon and Officers Adam Acre, 23, Harris Correa, 42, Jeesoo Pak, 28, Christopher Ward, 29, and Paramveer Sing, 24, to the scene, authorities said. \nA standoff quickly ensued, with the robbers surrendering within moments.

(Jeff Bachner/for New York Daily News) \nNo injuries were reported as the pair was taken into custody, cops said. \n\"We were instructing them, ‘You drop the gun!’... that was the only comment,” Correa said. “It took possibly two minutes, but it felt a little bit longer.” \n“It was very surreal,” said Correa, who said that, despite the tense scene, everyone appeared calm. \nCops were on hand in less than a minute, he said. \nSuspect in custody, 11 hostages safe in Jacksonville, Fla. \nGordon was only thinking about one thing — getting the victims out safely. \n\"When we got there we just did what we had to do,” Gordon said. \"There were people in there that needed help and we went there and helped them.\" \nThe two suspects were being questioned Saturday. Police are investigating the scene after armed would-be robbers held up a Chase bank in Queens. (Jeff Bachner/for New York Daily News) \nCharges were pending. Their names were not immediately released. \nPolice sources said the two men chose to hit the bank branch so early in the morning because they didn’t want to deal with any customers. \nThe plan was a far cry from the typical bank robbery, when someone walks up to the teller’s station and hands over a threatening note, never showing any weapons, officials said. \nIn those cases, success is usually based on whether or not a teller falls for the bluff, cops said. \nFive of the six hero cops are still rookies, with less than two years on the job. The only officer with more time is Correa, who is celebrating his 16th year with the department. \n“They did an outstanding job today in a volatile situation, a very dangerous situation,” their supervisor Lt. Starvos Spanos said. “They used very sound judgement and tactics, no one was injured, not a single shot was fired.” Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:15:03.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
