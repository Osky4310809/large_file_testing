Sayani Gupta , who’s been a part of Fan, Jolly LLB2 and Baar Baar Dekho , will next be seen in Anurag Basu ‘s Jagga Jasoos where she plays Ranbir Kapoor ‘s friend. And for this film, her character is a 14-year-old. Sayani says: \nIt’s the best casting of my life. I love dada (Anurag Basu) to have had the imagination to see me as a little girl who is all of 14 years. I loved his audition process as well, it was so simple. He is quite a genius and this character will always be very close to my heart. People who have seen me in the look can’t believe that I am not a teen. Haha… I remember I had cut my hair and went for the audition and dada was quite surprised because actors don’t do these things before they have gotten the part. And once I went on set on the first day of shoot, and we were deciding the look for the character, I insisted that I should cut my hair in this little bob. Ajay, Ranbir’s hair stylist was all excited to chop my locks, but Dada wasn’t convinced at first but I had the look so vivid in my mind, that after a while with Ranbir’s help, I finally managed to convince dada. He was super happy with the look. And then I just got stuck in this short hair look for over two years now. And I love it. \nI love Sayani’s hair, but had no idea she’d initially cut it for Jagga Jasoos . Can’t wit to see what she looks like in the film! 18", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T16:09:58.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
