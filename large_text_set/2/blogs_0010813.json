It’s a way for you to bond with each other.” \nCBS Dallas-Fort Worth reported that couples have been signing up for the unorthodox Valentine’s Day Date Night for weeks. \n“You’re always looking for something you can do together on Valentine’s Day that isn’t so overrated, isn’t so cheesy,” explained Lowery. \n“I would do anything other than a typical night out,” said Naomi Garcia. “It’s definitely not a cliché.” \n“You learn so much about the other person doing something totally out of the box,” says Hannah who goes shooting with her boyfriend every Valentine’s Day. “We’ve given each other ammo and stuff like that.” \n“If you don’t want to get her roses, get her a rifle,” Lowery concluded. \nThe Valentine’s Day Date Night at the Defenders Shooting Center costs $45 per person and includes a gun rental, ammunition, hors d’oeuvres, and cocktails (after all the shooting is over).
