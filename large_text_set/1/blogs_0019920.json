The offer comes from third-party sellers but is ‘Fulfilled by Amazon,’ meaning you’re covered by Amazon should you have any problems or wish to return it.\nThe Samsung Gear VR was built in partnership with Oculus and is used in conjunction with a Samsung phone to deliver 360-degree gaming and entertainment. It’s compatible with the following handsets:\nGalaxy S7 Galaxy S7 Edge Galaxy Note 5 Galaxy S6 Galaxy S6 Edge Galaxy S6 Edge+ The Gear VR on sale is the ‘International’ version, which in this case means that the packaging/manuals may not be in English. However, there are no functional/compatibility differences between the US and International models.\nIf you want to pick one up, visit the Samsung Gear VR Amazon page , tap on the ‘Used & new’ purchase options, and scroll down until you see the $52.51 fulfilled by Amazon units.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T12:20:28.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
