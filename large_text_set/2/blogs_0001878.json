The title is already available in some regions, including Australia and Europe, but it doesn’t appear to be live in the US quite yet (but it could be by the time you read this).\nFire Emblem Heroes is only Nintendo’s second game to hit Android, following Miitomo last year ( Pokemon Go was published by Nintendo, but it was developed by Niantic) and arrives before Super Mario Run, which will be ported to Android from iOS in March.\nFire Emblem Heroes is a turn-based fantasy title which features tactical, grid-based battles. You are tasked with preventing the destruction of the land of Askr, using new and past heroes from the Fire Emblem series to support your fight. The series is noted for its deep strategy and the permanent death of characters, meaning you shouldn’t get too attached to your allies.\nSee also: Inside Google Play: These were the top trending apps and games in January 2017 12 hours ago Nintendo recently revealed its financial earning for 2016 and discussed that Super Mario Run had been downloaded 78 million times. The title has made a reported $53 million in revenue for the company, though it features a slightly different free-to-play model than Fire Emblem Heroes. Unlike Run, Heroes doesn’t have a paid unlock for the full game but instead has a stamina system which limits how long you can play the game for. One way to replenish the stamina bar quickly is to pay for Orbs, the in-game currency.\nSuper Mario is the more well-known franchise but Fire Emblem’s unlimited in-app purchases means it could prove to be the more lucrative title in the long term.\nDownload Fire Emblem Heroes via the link below and let us know in the comments what you think of it.\nDownload Fire Emblem Heroes at Google Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T13:29:30.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
