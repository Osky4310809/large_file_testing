At around 16.00 on Tuesday, Shaw resigned. \nRelive Shaw's crazy 24 hours below: 16.00 - Shaw hoovers Sutton's dugout in preparation for the big game (Photo: GETTY) 19.00 - Teamsheets released, Shaw confirmed as substitute (Photo: REUTERS) 19.55 - Takes place on Sutton United bench (Photo: REUTERS) 20.45 - Spotted in the bar at half-time 21.05 - Applauds Arsenal fans singing \"Fatty, give us a wave\" (Photo: REUTERS) 21.30 - Eats pie on subs bench (Photo: BBC) 21.50 - Watches his side lose 2-0 to Arsenal (Photo: Rex Features) 07.00 - Makes appearance on Good Morning Britain (Photo: Rex Features) 09.30 - Sutton boss Paul Doswell slams Shaw over pie-eating stunt (Photo: PA) 12.30 - Shaw approached by Morrisons to become official 'pie-taster' (Photo: PA) 13.30 - Shaw subject of FA investigation over breaking betting rules (Photo: BBC) 15.55 - Sutton United request resignation from Shaw (Photo: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images) 16.00 - Shaw resigns from position (Photo: BBC Sport)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:39:30.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
