NHS chief warns frontline staff are worn out after relentless winter \nIt found that they felt \"less committed\" to working in the UK and felt less appreciated by the Government following the referendum. \nThe BMA said that recruiting from Europe had been vital in dealing with staff shortages in the health service. \nDr Mark Porter, chairman of council at the BMA, said: \"While thousands of overseas and EU doctors work across the UK to provide the best possible care for patients, many from the EU are left feeling unwelcome and uncertain about whether they and their families will have the right to live and work in the UK after Brexit. \n\"These are the people who staff our hospitals and GP surgeries, look after vulnerable patients in the community and conduct vital medical research to help save lives. \n\"Many have dedicated years of service to healthcare in the UK, so it's extremely concerning that so many are considering leaving. \n\"At a time when the NHS is already at breaking point and facing crippling staff shortages, this would be a disaster and threaten the delivery of high-quality patient care.‚Äù \nHe urged the Government to act to ensure long-term stability across the healthcare system.
