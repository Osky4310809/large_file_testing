He and his staff were all welcoming, polite, professional, and on time (all things I look for in a Dentist). I had to changed Dentists since my insurance changed, and I was dreading finding a new one. I went to Dr. Sawaqed's office after reviewing a number of Dentists. I knew the moment I called and talked to Linda that she was on top of her job (she's the office manager). I felt confident that my records and insurance claims will be handled professionally by her. When I arrived to my appointment Linda was so welcoming, and they saw me right on time. Tiffany started my appointment with me and did the xrays. She was also very friendly and welcoming. Dr. Sawaqed immediately came in after the xrays and introduced himself and did the exam - this is not something I have ever experienced with a Dentist. Often I would meet 2-3 of his staff and the dentist would come in at the very end after I had to wait forever...but not here! My interactions with Dr. Sawaqed were cordial and made the appointment go quickly without pain or anxiety for me. Overall, the office is clean and comfortable. They use new technology including digital xrays and files. Obviously, I had a very good experience. I hope you do too!
