(Photo: Let's Move) \nBack in 2014, after the Miami Heat won back-to-back championships, the team went to the White House to celebrate, and they starred in a hilarious video to support then-First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign. \nIn the video, as Erik Spoelstra interviews Dwyane Wade and Ray Allen, LeBron James and Michelle do goofy things in the background. It was fantastic. \nD-Wade brought the moment back up again on Instagram on Saturday, the day after the Obamas officially left the White House for the last time . He captioned it: \nIt will Never… Be another…. #TheObamas A video posted by dwyanewade (@dwyanewade) on Jan 21, 2017 at 2:38pm PST \nSince then, everything has changed, and not just who's living in the White House. Ray Allen retired , LeBron went back to Cleveland and won a title, and D-Wade is with the Chicago Bulls. It's crazy how time flies.  //ftw.usatoday.com/2017/01/dwyane-wade-michelle-obama-dunk-video-throwback-heat/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T01:47:25.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
