Yes, both teams had already punched their ticket to the postseason, but the victor would be the season’s NFC North division champ. \nAnd both teams treated the game with the earnestness it merited ... hey who’s that kid behind Michele Tafoya?\nExcellent dance moves, little guy. And great job getting that tee after the kickoff. Where can we get a cool shirt like yours?\nThanks for also not endlessly dabbing while you were on camera, kid! Hope you had fun at the game!
