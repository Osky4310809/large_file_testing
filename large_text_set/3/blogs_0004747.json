I went backstage and confronted him. I told him 'I've got a problem with what you said'. Ohara Davies \n\"Some of the guys Floyd was with, like Ashley Theophane, I know. Ashley told Floyd 'this is the WBC silver champion'. \n\"Floyd said 'I've got Gervonta Davis who fights at 130lbs, let's get it on'. He was saying a few things about Gervonta. I didn't want to disrespect him, so I went back to my seat. \n\"While I was sat down, I thought 'he's just disrespected me'. So afterwards I went backstage and confronted him. I told him 'I've got a problem with what you said'. Just because he's Floyd it doesn't mean I won't tell him if I've got an issue. Mayweather's promotion of Gervonta Davis sparked the row with Davies \n\"He can't compare me to a 130lbs fighter. I felt disrespected by being compared to someone 10lbs below me. We went back and forth. He said Gervonta is the youngest world champion, I told him that doesn't matter. \n\"He went to the car. I saw him again on the way out. He said 'what champion are you?' I'm the WBC silver champion. He said 'the WBC only comes in gold'. \n\"I told him that boxing is now in the UK. Maybe in his time, five or six years ago, it wasn't - Floyd doesn't like that, so he tried to discredit me. Ohara Davies \n\"I've beaten everyone put in front of me, so just because he's Floyd, that doesn't mean he can discredit what I've achieved. That's not on. \n\"He got really offended, like 'why is this peasant talking to me?' It got heated, we were both angry. We're fighters and we've got egos. He got really offended, like 'why is this peasant talking to me?' It got heated, we were both angry. We're fighters and we've got egos. Ohara Davis \n\"The third argument, outside by the car, went on for quite a while. He can't speak to me however he wants.\" \nDavies shone last weekend in a stoppage victory over 51-fight veteran Derry Mathews but his run-in with Mayweather has turned his attention to facing a representative from the American's promotion. \nTheophane, a challenger for the world super-lightweight title in Davies' weight division, is top of his wish list.
