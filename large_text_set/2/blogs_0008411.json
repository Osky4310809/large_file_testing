No, that's not a typo. Palace lost 4-0 to Sunderland. At home. Here’s an equally curious image taken from the Sunderland game. Photo by Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images Upcoming fixtures: Stoke (A, February 11) Tammy Abraham , for the first time in a long while, was subbed off in the 58th minute alongside two of his other teammates, as Lee Johnson rang the changes of Bristol City’s must-win clash against Rotherham. Luckily for the Robins, Tammy’s replacement on the day, Milan Djuric scored the only goal of the game and kept them three points above the relegation zone. In midweek, Tammy grabbed the equalising goal against Sheffield Wednesday, although he might not have known much about it. \nIn less positive Tammy news, the 19-year-old crashed his car outside of Bristol City's training ground while driving without a licence or insurance . Fortunately no one was hurt. It's unclear what punishment he may face from the authorities or either one of his clubs, but this was a very stupid thing to do. Upcoming fixtures: Derby (A, February 11) Izzy Brown ’s month got off to an auspicious note, with him being named Huddersfield’s player of the month for January - the very month he got there! He started against Championship leaders Brighton and was named man of the match in an inspired 3-1 victory despite not scoring or assisting directly. He picked up a little knock in the same game and was presumably rested on Sunday in a huge derby game against Leeds United, which saw Kasey Palmer ’s first involvement for Huddersfield in a month. Palmer was named in the starting line-up in place of Brown but his hamstring injury flared up only 27 minutes into the game and he was replaced by his fellow Chelsea loanee. Soon after, Brown found the back of the net and turned in another positive display in what was an emphatic, last-gasp victory to keep Huddersfield well in contention for cementing a play-off spot with perhaps even a look-in at an automatic promotion spot. David Wagner later confirmed that Palmer would miss a further eight weeks because of his latest injury setback. It’s been an extremely unfortunate turn of events for the attacking midfielder since the new year but hopefully he’ll return in time to help them to promotion. Upcoming fixtures: QPR (A, February 11) Lucas Piazon and Tomas Kalas , both picked up 90 minutes and a clean sheet in a 0-2 win against Burton Albion before losing to Gianfranco Zola’s Birmingham City, with Piazon playing only 60 minutes in that one. It was, in fact, Zola’s first win with his new club. The Cottagers remain six points from the final play-off spot, in 10th. Upcoming fixtures: Wigan (H, February 11) Fikayo Tomori was an unused substitute for Brighton, despite the suspension to first-choice center-back Lewis Dunk. Upcoming fixtures: Burton (H, February 11) Christian Atsu should be able to make his return to the Newcastle side this weekend after finishing fourth at the Africa Cup of Nations and getting named to the Team of the Tournament. Upcoming fixtures: Wolverhampton Wanderers (A, February 11) Jay Dasilva once again, went as an unused substitute as Charlton drew 1-1 against Fleetwood Town. Fankaty Dabo and Charlie Colkett have cemented their places as starters in the Swindon side; both were in the XI against Oxford United, a game which saw Dabo find the back of the net for the first time as a senior professional, and in some style! Unfortunately, Swindon let in two goals in quick succession in the 70th and 73rd minutes, going on to lose 1-2. There was no place for Islam Feruz in the matchday squad, but he did find the back of the net playing for Swindon’s Development Squad earlier this week. Jordan Houghton played all but the last one or two minutes of Doncaster’s 1-1 draw against Morecambe. Despite the draw, Doncaster sit pretty atop the League Two table, five points (and an extra game) ahead of Plymouth Argyle. Alex Kiwomya played 67 minutes of Crewe’s 4-0 loss to Exeter City. Jamal Blackman ’s Wycombe finally saw their lengthy unbeaten run come to an end at the hands of Exeter City, losing 4-2, but they picked up 3 points on Saturday, against Portsmouth with Blackman keeping another clean sheet in the 1-0 victory. Wycombe are now 6th, which is the final promotion play-off place, although with Portsmouth and Mansfield Town hot on their trail. \nNathan Baxter played in Solihull Moors' 1-0 loss to Lincoln City. Baxter's team must be as good as Leeds United, by the transitivity property. GERMANY: Andreas Christensen and Borussia Monchengladbach picked up where they left off last weekend, comfortably seeing off Freiburg 3-0. He also played the whole of their cup match against Greuther Furth, which saw them through to the quarter-finals. Their opponents in the upcoming round will be Hamburger SV. Upcoming fixtures: Werder Bremen (A, February 11) Michael Hector played 90 minutes in Eintracht Frankfurt’s DFB Pokal game against Hannover. Eintracht won 2-1, progressing to the quarter finals where they will face second division side, Arminia Bielefeld. Hector was uninvolved in their league victory against Darmstadt though. Frankfurt now sit in 3rd (!) place, although there are only three points separating sides placed 3rd and 7th. Upcoming fixtures: Leverkusen (A, February 11) THE NETHERLANDS: A quickfire double from Adnane Tighadouini and Ricky van Wolfswinkel was enough for Vitesse to see off ADO Den Haag last weekend, extending their unbeaten streak to five in all competitions. Lewis Baker played the whole 90 and Nathan played 87 minutes; Matt Miazga was the one to come on for Nathan, in what is looking like a standard substitution employed by Henk Fraser to help Vitesse keep their lead in tact at the death, which they spectacularly failed to do on multiple occasions previously, this season. Mukhtar Ali was an unused substitute. Upcoming fixtures: Willem II (H, February 11) Bertrand Traore will presumably look to be involved with Ajax once again this weekend, following his exploits with Burkina Faso at the African Cup of Nations. Upcoming fixtures: Sparta Rotterdam (H, February 12) Feyenoord look like they’re going to be very hard to beat to the title this season, although Ajax and PSV will look to do their best to stay in the race; PSV picked up a fourth consecutive win, beating AZ Alkmaar 2-4. Marco van Ginkel played 84 minutes and assisted Luuk de Jong’s goal in the 80th minute. Upcoming fixtures: FC Utrecht (H, February 12) Danilo Pantic was an unused substitute for Excelsior. BELGIUM: Cristian Cuevas was an unused substitute for STVV, while Matej Delac and Mouscron lost 1-0 to Genk. OTHERS: Jeremie Boga played half an hour as Granada won 1-0 against Las Palmas via a strike from Manchester United loanee Andreas Pereira in the 17th minute. With the win, Granada moved off bottom place but still remain five points from 17th-placed Leganes. Victorien Angban was not involved. Upcoming fixtures: Eibar (A, February 13) Mario Pasalic played 72 minutes against Sampdoria and the whole 90 against Bologna, against he scored a last-minute winner, converting Gerard Deulofeu’s cross from close range despite Milan being down to nine men! Photo by Mario Carlini / Iguana Press/Getty Images Upcoming fixtures: Lazio (A, February 13) Miro Muheim became the latest addition to the Loan Army, heading to Swiss second division leaders, FC Zurich, on loan for the rest of the season. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Muheim, he’s an 18-year-old attacking midfielder who signed for Chelsea as a 16-year-old in the summer of 2014 from FC Zurich itself. Der 18-jährige Schweizer Nachwuchsinternationale Miro Muheim wechselt per sofort leihweise vom @ChelseaFC zum #FCZ : https://t.co/hjvsc7YmsW pic.twitter.com/DmIAPaUQfQ — FC Zürich (@fc_zuerich) February 2, 2017 He was an unused substitute in Zurich’s recent 2-1 loss to Servette.
