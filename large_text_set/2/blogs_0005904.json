Earlier today, a Houston area man was caught flying a drone over the Atlanta Falcons practice facility. \nVia Atlanta Journal Constitution \nhe Atlanta Falcons have been practicing\nat Rice University in the days leading up to the Super Bowl, and an eager fan apparently got crafty in trying to sneak a peek.\n“With the field situated next to a residential area abutting the Rice campus, there was extra SECURITY between the edge of the field (with a fence and high hedges) and the neighborhood, so the Falcons could feel secure running a practice as though they were at their home facility,” today’s pool report issued by the NFL said.\nThe drone operator was described only as an area resident, and it wasn’t clear if he or she would face any charges. But the device was grounded, the report said.\nIt’s obvious that the Patriots have nothing to do with this but the jokes are still going to fly. \nI'm not calling Belichick a cheater, but WHY does something sketchy ALWAYS happen before big games? Playbook stolen, drones, etc. Come on… https://t.co/V26QgGGG7e \n— Connor Grott (@Connor_Grott) February 4, 2017 \nHaha the Patriots up to their usual shady business https://t.co/6U33xCFgUo \n— Jonathan Farmer (@BRaider1416) February 4, 2017 \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:06:17.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
