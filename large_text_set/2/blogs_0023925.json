They were not supposed to do this . In fact, if the capabilities of the SSC-8 \"intermediate missile\" are accurately reported, it should not exist at all. Essentially, if the report is true, Putin issued a massive \"fuck you\" to Trump, who he's been playing for a sucker who knows nothing about military issues. The report was only published last week, but the actions required to move an entire missile unit had to have been planned weeks ago. With any sort of military competence, it would likely take a month or two.   Hm, what happened roughly two months ago? But something about that Times article rubbed me wrong. Although a host of other outlets echoed the story, no other news outlet had independent reporting on the missile, and the story was suspiciously vague on details. Specifically, the Times reported that this Russian missile battalion had left its base in the east, but it did not say where it went. Getty Most Popular So I called the Pentagon. This is what I got back: \"I will not comment on intelligence matters. The Russian Federation remains in violation of its INF Treaty obligations. The Department of Defense has made very clear our concerns about Russia's violation, the risks it poses to European and Asian security, and our strong interest in Russia returning to compliance with the Treaty. We support a review of Russia's ongoing INF Treaty violation in order to assess the potential security implications for the United States and its allies and partners. I refer you to the Department of State for more information.\" In other words, nada. Simply stated, there are four types of data that can be collected, which, once analyzed, can become \"intelligence.\" Intel is not just raw information, it is raw information assessed by professionals, cross-checked or verified to make it a usable commodity. There are four types: Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), and \"Open Source.\" Each has strengths and weaknesses, and optimally you want several types of intel data to develop a stronger idea about what you think has happened or will happen. Since each type of data is unique, you want to do your best not to reveal exactly how you obtained some intelligence. This is known as protecting your \"sources and methods.\" (The Director of National Intelligence's office itself offers a more comprehensive list of how intelligence is collected.) Getty   SIGINT This means intercepting electronic or other transmissions—phone conversations, text messages, or radio commands— and decoding them. Straightforward in concept, this is the term used for everything from \"Low-Level Voice Intercepts\" (listening to the Taliban's radio calls in Afghanistan) to the global email and phone eavesdropping that the National Security Agency (NSA) specializes in. A significant subset of this is Electronics Intelligence, or ELINT, which is more specifically a military tool. This is the collection of data about electronics emissions. Think \"radars\" and \"surface to air missiles,\" just to scratch the surface. HUMINT The most delicate kind of intelligence, HUMINT could be a U.S. Embassy worker who overhears a local loudmouth in a bar, an actual CIA spy (though this is quite rare), or a team of Green Berets that parachutes behind the lines to keep eyes on a specific target. But more often, it is pretty mundane: reports sent by various military attachés at each embassy, for example. It is not spying, after all, if the host government has invited you to observe the latest military maneuver or weapons test. IMINT This used to mean just high-flying spy-planes like the U2 and the SR-71, plus satellites. Now it includes a host of different unmanned vehicles. The old saying that a \"picture is worth a thousand words\" sort of falls flat in this field. A lot of the time you need some really smart and particularly experienced analysts to tell you what is in those pictures. \"Open Source\" Pretty self-explanatory, and in many ways perhaps the most useful, this involves the collection of information in publicly available documents. That could include corporate briefing materials, industry analysis reports published commercially, newspapers, or public statements and speeches given by people of interest. Getty The intelligence community strongly prefers an intel package that combines several of these different types of sources, because each one of their sources is less likely to be compromised. Which brings us back to that Times story. Read it again and reconsider the denial from the Pentagon. Why would they do that? This is either a sign that the intelligence is less reliable, or that it comes from only one type of intel and the IC would really rather not expose themselves by revealing the actual location of the Russian missile unit. Or perhaps the State Department has gone rogue and put out information that was squirrelly in the first place. After all it is not often that the Department of Defense defers to the State Department on issues of missiles and potential nuclear weapon deployments.
