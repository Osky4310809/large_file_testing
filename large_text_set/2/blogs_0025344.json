But now, with the release of Logan , Jackman is finally putting Wolverine (and the Wolverine diet) to bed. Jimmy Fallon , always the considerate soul, wanted to celebrate the end of Jackman’s X-Men fasting during the actor’s Tonight Show appearance last Friday. And so, toward the end of their segment, the late-night host summoned his buddy Mario Batali from backstage, who surprised Jackman with a gigantic bowl of pasta and a hearty pour of wine. This clip captures the pure joy of kicking your diet to the curb and diving head-first into a pile of delicious carbohydrates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:49:55.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
