From 6 PM to 12 AM every night Monday through Friday, we would always get together and write. \n\"We just kept doing it. Four years into it, our first album came out, ' When Day and Dream Unite ' on Mechanic Records. That didn't do all too much. \n\"Then four years later, things started happening with ' Images and Words '. All throughout that period, we maintained our work ethic. It was what we did. We didn't know what was happening until it was happening.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T14:02:58.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
