Reuters, AP | Published: 29.03.17 , 14:07 \nJordan's King Abdullah accused Israel on Wednesday of wrecking the chances of peace by accelerating settlement building in disputed territory in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. \nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n\n\"Israel is continuing to expand settlements and wreck chances of peace ... There is no peace or stability in the region without a just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian cause through a two-state solution,\" the king said in a speech at the start of an Arab summit held beside the Dead Sea. \n\nDivided Arab leaders who are attending the one day summit will be seeking common ground to reaffirm their commitment to a Palestinian state, a longstanding goal that US President Donald Trump last month put into doubt. \nKing Abdullah of Jordan at the Arab League summit (Photo: AFP) \nAt a White House news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, Trump indicated he was open to a one-state solution to the conflict. \n\nKing Abdullah, whose dynasty has custodianship over Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, said any \"unilateral\" Israeli move to change the \"status quo\" in the Dome of the Rock and the Aqsa mosque would have \"catastrophic\" consequences on the future of the region, inflaming Muslim sentiment. \n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also spoke at the summit, saying that efforts to end conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya must \"not distract us from seeking to heal the longest open wound in the region, the plight of the Palestinian people.\" \n\nGuterres said establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel is the only solution to the conflict. He reiterated international position that Israeli settlements on war-won land are illegal, and called on Israel to halt construction. \n\nAhead of the summit, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he expected the Arab League to give full backing to the Palestinian positions and to deliver a \"clear message to the world about Palestinian rights.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:03:22.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
