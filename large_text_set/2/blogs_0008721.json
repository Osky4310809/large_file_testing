He won an NBA Championship, signed a nice deal with the Milwuakee Bucks and got his own shoe. Dellavedova signed with Chinese shoe company Peak in the offseason giving him his own shoe the Delly 1. His colorways include “Down Under”, “College”, “Team Green”, and everyone’s favorite ... “Hustle”. The Hustle is just a black shoe if we’re being honest. The rest have a slight color variation.\nThis shoe really reminds me of the Kobe 11. Which look here ... Dellavedova used to wear. \nMark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports And you know, it’s fine that Delly modeled his shoes after Kobe Bryant’s. The Kobe’s are my favorite signature shoe out there and I can’t blame him for doing that. But why are these shoes $159.99? That is far too expensive. Update: I’ve been told they’re only $122.00 in USD and the $159.99 is in Australian Dollars. It’s still too much.\nYou can see all the colorways here and purchase them if you’d like. Again, for $159.99, I mean $122.00\nYou can also watch the full and slightly awkward commercial here on Delly’s shoes.\nPeak has several other NBA stars on their roster and honestly this was just an excuse for me to drop the picture of the legendary Blonde George Hill in this post. So here you go. They’re still using blonde George Hill on Peak.com and I love it. Long live blonde George Hill, the best George Hill there ever was.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:17:19.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
