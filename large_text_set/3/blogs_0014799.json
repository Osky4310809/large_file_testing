The engines required constant fine-tuning. Leaks were a regular nuisance. A fuel or oil line would break or a gasket would give away. The piping of two of the fuel tanks cracked, which required engineers to weld them back together.

The mission was under Operation Deep Freeze 2017 , the U.S. military’s component of the National Science Foundation managed by the U.S. Antarctic Program. \nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\nAlready operating ten years past her expected operational date, the Polar Star cut a channel from Beaufort Island to McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The 150-member crew widened the channel so that it could escort a cargo ship and a fuel ship to deliver a year’s worth of cargo and fuel to the McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole research stations.\nCapt. Michael Davanzo , who assumed command of Polar Star last July, told Foxtrot Alpha that the boat held up remarkably well, considering her age and ongoing mechanical issues. There was an unusual amount of ice this year that forced the crew’s engineers to work 24 hours per day to keep the boat from breaking down.\n\n“The engineers worked really long hours to keep the boat running and making repairs as they came up,” Davanzo said. “If you could imagine living in an earthquake—that’s the only way I can associate it with 24 hours a day and everything rattling and vibrating. Sometimes we would get screws that would fall out from the overhead. Occasionally, a bracket or something would break and damage control men would weld things and make repairs as we’d go.”\n\n\nThe Polar Star moored at McMurdo Ice Pier in 2014.

During icebreaking, the challenge was to keep the load balances even between its three shafts so that one didn’t get overworked. The ice pilots had to survey the amount of power and speed exerted while breaking ice and the engineers kept a careful eye on the megawatt output.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:18:11.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
