The decisions to bring Moff Tarkin back from the dead and reproduce a young Leia were divisive, to say the least, among Star Wars fans. \nBut for all the times you notice the VFX, the reel Industrial Light & Magic compiled below will show you just how many times you may have missed it. \nIt's clear that there was only so much that Gareth Edwards could do with practical effects for his epic war story. That's where ILM comes in. What's most impressive about their work is not the massive explosions or stalking imperial marchers, but the subtle details they used to create the environments of the planets Jedha and Scarif. \nWorld-building is, for many sci-fi enthusiasts, the most exciting part of the Star Wars entries. And as the video above shows, animators spared no expense when creating the two planets. They used layer upon layer of renders to put together worlds that look like they could actually exist. From the palm trees dotting the islands on Scarif to the dust hovering above the city of Jedha, the details imagined by the VFX artist are brought to life in exquisite fashion. \nDo you think ILM will walk away with yet another Oscar?
