How boring is it to see every website shower the same stale AAA games with praise at the end of each holiday season? So at Geek.com, we’re doing what we can to put a stop to this in Game of the Year , a new column celebrating worthy alternative picks for the year’s greatest game regardless of genre, platform, year of release, or even quality. Here, any game can be Game of the Year! \nOne of the cool perks of being a games journalist in New York is stumbling into the plethora of indie game events that seem to pop up all the time. If you pay attention to Twitter on some random night you can wander into an art museum or whatever and play some cool new game you’ve never heard of that may never be seen again. For example, last year I went to the annual No Quarter exhibit presented by NYU and played this week’s Game of the Year: Breakup Squad by Brooklyn Gamery .\n\nBreakup Squad’s look at relationships filtered through retro video games might scratch your Scott Pilgrim itch. Each of the five players controls a friend at a party. Two players are former lovers, and the end of their last toxic relationship was bad news for everyone involved. However, for some reason, they are determined to get back together at this party. The other three friends, looking to prevent another catastrophe, decide to do whatever it takes to prevent this reunion.\nWhat follows is an asymmetric multiplayer game where two players try to reach each other on the map while the other three try to keep them apart. All players also have to deal with navigating an accurately crowded New York party with bystanders more reminiscent of Luke Sidewalke r than Assassin’s Creed . If the lovers get together, they win. If the friends keep them apart for long enough, they win. Then it’s onto the next round, and players change roles.\n\nPremise aside, Breakup Squad is just a neat little multiplayer game. The changing goals remind me of the better Nintendo Land minigames. But the premise itself is also worth praising. It’s not super preachy, but it doesn’t shy away from what it’s trying to say. It gets across its social message through social gameplay, you know, the thing that makes games unique as an art form. Plus the diverse little retro character sprites are really cute.\nIf you can wrangle five controllers for your PC, pay just a buck for Breakup Squad (currently in Early Access) and have a great time with this game of the year.\nCheck back next week to read about the next Game of the Year !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:54:41.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
