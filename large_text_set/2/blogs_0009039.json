Mike Huckabee is putting his money on President Donald Trump over the federal government. \nDuring an appearance on Fox News’ Outnumbered last week, Huckabee scoffed at a Department of Homeland Security memo that said Trump’s border wall with Mexico would cost $21.6 billion and take about three years to build. \nThe estimate was also derided by Trump himself.   \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017 …design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017 \nHuckabee said government “always overestimates because they’re gonna slow-walk everything.”   \n“I would put my money on Donald Trump getting that wall built for a whole lot less than the government says it’s gonna cost and doing it much quicker,” said Huckabee. \nTrump’s history has been to be on time and stay “under budget,” Huckabee added. \n“We finally have someone in the White House who’s actually built something in his life, other than a political machine ,” Huckabee noted on Facebook.   Building The Wall Becomes High-Stakes Project For Hosts Of ‘The Five’ \nHuckabee offered a vintage Trump anecdote to remind America how ingrained it is in Trump get the job done instead of talking about the job. \nHuckabee noted that in that 1980s, an ice rink at New York City’s Central Park was deteriorating. Trump got involved because he was “disgusted with watching the liberals who ran New York City in the ‘80s waste years and millions of dollars ‘studying’ the problems …” Huckabee wrote. \n“Trump stepped up and offered to take over the job himself. Of course, critics sneered that he would soon learn how impossible the job was. Instead, he had the rink restored and open for business ahead of schedule and below budget, and it’s still open today,” Huckabee said. \nHuckabee said when it comes to getting things done, Trump has a far better track record than does government. \n“Trump takes a lot of flak for not being a political insider and knowing how the levers of government work. But as someone who actually has built things and stuck to budgets, he knows something far more valuable: that government has become an inefficient, obsolete machine whose levers haven’t been working for a long, long time, and someone needs either to fix them or scrap them,” Huckabee wrote.
