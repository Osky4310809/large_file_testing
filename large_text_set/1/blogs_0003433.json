Comment Matthew d'Ancona: Jeremy Corbyn is too proud to stand down and help a Labour revival \nDespite alarming opinion polls showing the party leaking votes its leader still believes his policies can win him power Wednesday 4 January 2017 12:14 BST Unassailable: Jeremy Corbyn acknowledges his re-election as party leader at last year’s conference Getty Images \nIt takes a talent approaching genius to pull off the dismal combination that characterises Jeremy Corbyn ’s leadership of Labour: to be both impregnable and irrelevant. In September he saw off a coup backed by 172 of his own MPs, defeating the challenger, Owen Smith , with a higher percentage of the vote than he had won in the leadership contest of 2015. Corbyn now heads a movement of more than half a million members — the largest party in the European Union. He is more or less unassailable. \nYet to what purpose? Yesterday the Fabian Society — one of the most venerable organisations affiliated to Labour — published an analysis concluding that the party has next to no chance of winning the next election outright, and might win fewer than 150 seats . Not surprisingly, this report has strengthened the conviction of many within the movement that Labour must build a “progressive alliance” with other Left-of-centre parties if the Conservatives are to be defeated in the foreseeable future. \nThe opinion polls fluctuate, but not much. In the latest YouGov/Times survey, the Tories are 15 points ahead of the Opposition — compared with 17 points last month. In Scotland, Labour has been eclipsed by the SNP, and faces a serious challenge from Ukip in its northern heartlands. Meanwhile, a knife-edge by-election, forced by the resignation of Jamie Reed just before Christmas, looms in Copeland, Cumbria. \nIt is now self-evident that the principal party of the Left is flirting with electoral catastrophe. In the past month I have spoken to two prominent figures from the New Labour years, both of whom expressed the fear that the party was finished. This you might expect (though their concerned were not voiced with relish). Less predictable — and more significant — are the publicly expressed doubts of those who supported Corbyn most vociferously in 2015. \nLast month Ken Livingstone told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: “If it’s as bad as this in a year’s time, we would all be worried.” In the Mirror this week Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, asked, “What happens if we get to 2019 and opinion polls are still awful? The truth is everybody would examine that situation, including Jeremy Corbyn and [shadow chancellor] John McDonnell.” Union boss 'fully supports' Corbyn despite saying he could step down \nBoth Livingstone and McCluskey are unambiguously men of the Left. Their respective interventions were not Blairite pleas for Labour to make an ideological shift to the centre but the survival reflexes of an organism facing extinction. \nAccordingly, a new yearning is gaining strength in Labour’s upper echelons: namely that Corbyn will accept that he is never going to be Prime Minister and go voluntarily — that honour might accomplish what an attempted coup could not. According to this narrative his replacement would restore credibility and stability to the party, as Michael Howard did for the Tories in 2003, preventing an electoral meltdown in 2020 and paving the way for a Labour revival during the next Parliament. \nThe catch is that Corbyn is — as we have seen — a proud and stubborn man. He also genuinely and sincerely believes that his brand of socialism is an idea whose time has come. Confronted with the far-Right populist revolution sweeping the West, he resorts to the old Marxist notion of “false consciousness”: the voters may think they want the demotic solutions of mean-spirited nativism but what they really crave, subconsciously, is the politics of the Left, long-denied to them by technocratic centrists. Why would a man who believes this, who has won two thumping victories in hard-fought leadership contests, forego the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to test his thesis in a general election? \nIn any case, Corbyn is the prime symptom of Labour’s predicament rather than its fundamental cause. The very fact that he is leader — and was re-elected to that post — shows that the party has advanced not a jot since the New Labour era. \nWhich is ironic, given the broader political context and the opportunities waiting to be seized by a Left-of-centre movement that has imagination as well as intellectual courage. Automation, outsourcing, the changing face of work: the party ought to be thinking deeply about the very nature of citizenship and the extent to which rampant consumerism is threatening to crowd out the dignity of labour. What jobs, if any, will there be for the children of today’s Amazon depot workers, Starbucks baristas and Uber drivers? Labour 'on course to win just 150 seats in a general election' \nSuccessful politics depends upon the mapping of timeless values on to contemporary circumstances. But this is precisely what Labour is not doing. Instead of grappling with the challenges of the 21st century it has reverted to type, reviving its belief in the magical money tree that always bears fruit, confusing the voters with its pronouncements on (for instance) the EU and the nuclear deterrent, and embracing a spectacularly old-fashioned liberation politics. \nWhen Tony Blair delivered his eulogy to the People’s Princess in 1997 he captured the spirit of a year. When Corbyn paid tribute to Fidel Castro he did the same. The trouble is that the year in question was 1959. \nPolitical parties are not intrinsically important. Their core purpose is not to campaign righteously at the fringes of public life but to acquire and retain power, and to use it to improve the wellbeing of the nation. Labour’s growth as a club may indeed be prodigious but it is also a matter of supreme irrelevance to those whom the party was founded to represent and protect. \nDoubtless the moral high ground is a pleasant place to be. But the only location that should matter to a Labour leader who really cares about the vulnerable, the struggling and the left-behind is No 10. In Theses on Feuerbach, Karl Marx posed the great challenge of politics thus: “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.” Right now, Labour shows no sign of doing either.
