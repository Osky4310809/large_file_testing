We celebrate our diversity and take pride in our tolerance.\" \nMr Khan insisted: \"London, like Scotland, is dedicated to fighting for a better world, based on our values of equality, fairness and justice\". \nBut he said the \"rise of populist and narrow nationalist parties around the world\" were evidence that \"we're living through extraordinary times\". \nThe London mayor, who was elected in 2016, subsequently changed the speech when he delivered it, telling his audience:\"Now of course I'm not saying that nationalists are somehow racist or bigoted. But now, more than ever, what we don't need is more division and separation. GETTY Sadiq Khan said he was not calling Scottish nationalists 'racist or bigoted' \nHe went on: \"With the world becoming an increasingly divided place, Brexit, President (Donald) Trump, and the rise of populist and narrow nationalist parties around the world, now's not the time to fuel that division. Or to seek separation or isolation.\" \nâ€œNow's not the time to play on people's fears. Or to pit one part of our country, or one section of our society, against each other. \"In that respect there's no difference between those who try to divide us on the basis of whether we're English or Scottish, and those who try to divide us on the basis of our background, race or religion. \n\"Conference, now's the time to build unity. To build a more United Kingdom.\" GETTY Nicola Sturgeon is desperately trying to pull Scotland out of the UK \nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale thanked Mr Khan for giving \"such a powerful speech\", hailing him as \"the pride of Labour\". \nThe mayor also used his conference address to give his backing to Ms Dugdale's plans for a more federal UK, saying he \"fully supports\" her call for a new Act of Union in the aftermath of Brexit to \"tackle the uneven spread of power between regions, nations and cities across Britain\". \nWith Labour having been out of power for a decade in Scotland, he told her: \"We ended eight years of Tory rule in London last May, so I'm telling you it can be done.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:10:13.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
