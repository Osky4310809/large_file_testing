We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” \nAs AT&T and Verizon’s decision to join the boycott demonstrates, however, advertisers aren’t satisfied yet with Google’s efforts–and that has the potential to hurt the company’s ad revenue. According to Kantar Media data cited by Bloomberg , Verizon and AT&T are the third- and fourth-largest advertisers in the United States, respectively, with AT&T alone spending $941.96 million on advertising last year. \nThe diverse group of companies and organizations already boycotting Google ads include the U.K. government, advertising and marketing agency Havas SA, Sainbury’s, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, GlaxoSmithKline, the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Guardian newspaper. \nIn a media statement, AT&T said “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure that this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” \nIn its own release, Verizon stated “We take careful measure to ensure our brand is not impacted negatively. Once we were notified that our ads were appearing on non-sanctioned websites, we took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation. We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future.” \nDisclosure: TechCrunch is a property of AOL, a Verizon company.
