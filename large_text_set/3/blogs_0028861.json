If it depends on me, he will stay in Madrid forever, but that is not something we are discussing right now, but again, if it depends on me, he will stay here.” \nMeanwhile, the president was tight-lipped on his side’s attempts to sign Kylian Mbappe from Monaco – a young man who made his France debut off the bench in Friday’s 3-1 win over Luxembourg. \n“Anything is possible, but we will not talk about players who don't belong to Real Madrid. He's a great player but we're only thinking about La Liga and the Champions League right now,” Perez said.
