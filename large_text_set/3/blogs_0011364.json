Footage from RT’s Ruptly agency captures the violent scenes that happened next. \nTurkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu’s plane was on Saturday barred from landing in the Netherlands following an exchange of warnings and threats between the two countries. Separately, Family Affairs Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya attempted to meet with supporters at the Turkish Consulate in Rotterdam, but was prevented from doing so by police and eventually expelled from the country. \nREAD MORE: Turkish FM threatens Dutch with sanctions if they cancel his landing permit – and they do \nBoth officials were planning to rally Turkish expatriates in support of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of the April referendum on boosting presidential powers. A large crowd of pro-Erdogan demonstrators took to Turkey’s Consulate in Rotterdam, despite Turkish officials allegedly telling the Dutch there had been no rally planned. \nWhile the Netherlands said “security reasons” were behind the decision to ban the public gathering, calling Ankara’s threat of sanctions the last straw, Turkey took the move as political, accusing the Dutch of trampling on democratic rights and freedoms, and of attempting to meddle in Turkish affairs. \nREAD MORE: Dutch police deport Turkish minister to Germany after barring her from consulate in Rotterdam \nErdogan, Cavusoglu and Kaya used strong words such as “fascist,” “racist” and “Nazis” to describe Dutch politicians opposing the visits, most notably the Dutch Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders who openly spoke against them. \nHundreds of ethnic Turkish demonstrators remained in central Rotterdam after Kaya was escorted by police to the German border, with tensions running high. Some rocks, bottles and flares flew at riot police cordons.The Dutch were, however, prepared, dispatching dozens of officers and a special police unit as the minister’s expulsion was being negotiated. Eventually, a water cannon was deployed to the consulate to break up the remains of the Turkish rally, with footage showing protesters dispersing as the water cannon showering the street. \nRuptly’s footage also showed mounted police clearing up the streets and barriers erected to fend off the crowd. Media reports said that batons and police dogs were also used to break up the rally in Rotterdam. Several protesters were subdued.Meanwhile, in Turkey, Dutch diplomatic premises were all reportedly shut and then blocked off by large crowds of demonstrators waving Turkish flags and nationalist symbols. Riot police could be seen guarding at the Dutch Consulate in Istanbul, but did not interfere as the crowd with loudspeakers blasted speeches and Turkish music at the compound’s gates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T07:28:08.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
