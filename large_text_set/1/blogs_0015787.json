Former Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg, who was third with 18.7 percent, endorsed Hamon saying that the primary shows that Socialist voters want more leftist policies. \n\nThe voters “have massively and seriously condemned” the government’s policies, Montebourg said. They “want the left to return to the path of the left.” \nBenoît Hamon’s Platform \nBenoît Hamon is a 49-year-old former education minister. Here is his platform. Universal basic income. National conference on “environmental democracy”. 50% renewable energy by 2025. Differentiated VAT for the “most virtuous products”. Ban on pesticides. Better repayments for dental care. A “Sixth Republic”. Transformation of the Senate into “college of territories”. The right of foreigners to vote in local elections. “Humanitarian visa” and redo of France a land of asylum. Consideration of the white vote. If the white vote is a majority vote, the election must be postponed. Media antitrust law. Labor law repeal to provide additional protection to employees. Help facilitate the takeover of SCOP companies by employees. Recognize burn-out as an occupational disease. \nThat reads like it came from The Onion. However, it’s translated from Benoît Hamon, favorite of the primary: his very left program . \nAccording to the Financial Times , “Mr Hamon’s proposals have been criticized as unrealistic and costly by rivals including Arnaud Montebourg”. \nNow, Montebourg backs Hamon because voters “want the left to return to the path of the left.” \nAmazing Twitter Performance \nIn a field of seven candidates, that platform got Hamon 35% of the vote. Amazing. \nHow did he get there? The new-fashioned way. Hamon has a huge following on Twitter. \nLooking Ahead \nDon’t rule out le Pen. \nShould Hamon square off against Marine le Pen, I believe le Pen would win. Le Pen might also win in the widely-expected final match-up against François Fillon, the Republican winner and former Prime Minister of France. \nRecent political events are such that anything could happen. \n#8 really makes one question how delusional they are. France runs on nuclear power. They went hog wild with adopting it. \n\nThese socialists seriously want everyone to live a pseudo life through the internet and VR instead of in the real world. Congrats to the socialist clown. It’s kind of hard to F up France more than it is now. It might take a Marine to fix it. \npiliage NidStyles Jan 23, 2017 2:21 AM \nFor a real laugh riot (literally) check out #16 \n\"Consideration of the white vote. If the white vote is a majority vote, the election must be postponed.\" \nWhat could possibly go wrong? Consideration of the white vote. If the white vote is a majority vote, the election must be postponed. \nnationstates nationstates Jan 23, 2017 2:22 AM \nI just realized at the moment the true French are still the majority, so as White are the majority, there will never be elections in France ever again. \nAs of 2004, French conservative think-tank Institut Montaigne estimated that there were 60 million (85%) white people of European origin, 6 million (10%) North African people, 2 million (3.5%) Black people and 1 million (1.5%) people of Asian origin in Metropolitan France, including all generations of immigrant descendants.

FRENCH. \nAgain we see the masochistic faux morality of the Far Left - France belongs to immigrants more then the native French... and this isn't about protecting minority rights but about denying any rights to the majority, ie denying democracy itself to give a political heckler's veto to the minority because they are NOT French. \nRecently watched on youtube a video called 'Sweden is dying don't let this happen to your country' which is a very good, and I think moderate (its not racist or racialist - it's intelligent and thoughtful - and it basically made me realize that the Multiculturalist Left has become psychologically masochistic. \nSwedes would rather their country and culture and yes, ethnic nation be destroyed - than be thought of as 'racist' - So they will even tolerate Barbara Specter in their midst, and literally pay for her to help destroy their country, even though Specter is, as a Jewish Supremacist and Zionist... quite obviously racist and full of hate for whites. \nWe need to stop thinking if it as a political viewpoint because it is irrational and self destructive... they think that retaining their own culture and nationhood and thinking of themselves as a 'people' who have a homeland is 'hate'... but ONLY because they're white \nWhile the Jews and Muslims in their midst are somehow not racist for supporting sharia, or a jewish ethnostate etc. \nIts psychopathy. Its like a teenager cutting herself. \nits the mindset of someone in a lifeboat who will keep demanding more people be let on board, even as the boat begins to take on water, and everyone begins to sink together into the abyss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T10:05:27.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
