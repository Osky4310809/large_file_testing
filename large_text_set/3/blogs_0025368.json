Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nStrictly’s Darcey Bussell doesn’t reckon Craig Revel Horwood will be new head judge – and she’s ­got the jitters about who will. \nShe thinks Craig is too involved in ­helping produce the hit show to replace Len Goodman in the top job, she said to the Sunday People . \nAnd the former ballerina says the BBC dance contest will miss “bossy” Len, 72, who quit after the last series. \nDarcey , 47, said: “We don’t have any idea what will happen and I know they’re not going to tell us until the last minute. \n“It’s gone very quiet all of a sudden on the rumoured names front. I’m nervous – it’s a good nervous, not bad nerves – but, yeah, I’m getting excited. \n“Everyone is asking when it will be announced and I should think it will happen when they ­announce the celebrities.” \nShe added: “Don’t you think I should have a say in this?” \nTalking about Len, who quit after a decade to focus on his family, she continued: “Strictly is going to really miss him. \n“He is incredibly clever, ­brilliant at what he does. He’s an institution. He has his own Len Goodman academy, totally ­successful at everything he does. It was a real pleasure to be with him.” Read More Former Ballerina thinks Craig Revel Horwood is too busy producing the show to take over as head judge (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nShe played down 52-year-old Craig’s chances of replacing him. \n“I suppose maybe it would be Craig – but he’s a bit of a producer now. He produces a lot behind the scenes,” she says. \n“Bossiest judge was Len, but it was his job to be bossy and so he should have been – but I don’t know who would come in next. \n“I’ve known Craig the longest so I’m probably naturally closest to him. He’s choreographed a lot of work over the years and I have seen him doing that.” \nDarcey herself has even been tipped to take on the head judge role. \nAnd she says she’s getting fitter so she can wear some glamorous gowns when the show starts in September.
