If you asked her, “Why whipped cream boobs?” She’d respond, “Why not?” \nWe are so intrigued by that. \nApparently, so is actress Amanda Seyfried , as she sent out this tweet last night: Corinne fits perfectly in this strange new world we're living in pic.twitter.com/h7kfeNhvo4 \n— Amanda Seyfried (@AmandaSeyfried) February 14, 2017 \nLike, Corinne, the door was opened for you? \nIs this your taking a stand against the machines? Like, when certain women are like, “I don’t need a MAN to open my door?” You don’t need a MACHINE to open yours? \nMore likely, you just didn’t see it and you chose the harder/farther away exit just because you missed it completely. \nI however like to think you have a deep mistrust for automatic doors that stems from a childhood trauma of getting stuck in one at your local grocery store. (If so, you and I have far more in common than I once assumed — besides just “my heart is gold, but my vagina is platinum.”) \nI feel like Corinne and Seyfried’s “Mean Girls” character would get along swimmingly. \nRegardless, you have to admire Corinne dancing to the beat of her own drummer and choosing the road less traveled. (The road she chose is the one with doors she has to open herself.) \nBut wait… I have just found evidence Corinne does in fact use automatic doors . \nW W. \nSo, which is it, Corinne? Pro- or anti-automatic doors? When will your web of lies and deceit end? \nAs of yesterday, the remaining contestants are Corinne, Rachel, Raven and Vanessa. \nRachel is set to appear as the next “Bachelorette.” I Hired A Nanny To Be Like Corrine From The Bachelor To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
