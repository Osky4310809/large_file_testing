They can sell online for anything between £15 and £25. ‘Typo’ Guy Fawkes coin \nThe Royal Mint released a commemorative 50p in 2005 on the 400th anniversary of the Gunpowder plot but some of those had a slightly embarrassing typo and read ‘Pemember, pemember the Fifth of November’. They sell online for between £5 and £7, typically. Charles Dickens £2 \nThese were released in 2012 to commemorate the 200th birthday of the famous author, with the reverse of the coin featuring the titles of his better known books. These can now sell online for around £4, sometimes more if in particularly good condition. Coppers \nIt was recently suggested that the UK might simply stop using pennies in the future, as they are effectively worthless. However, there are a few coppers that are far from worthless. Silver 2p (Photo: PA) \nPoppy collectors were given a 2p coin that they assumed was fake because it was silver. However, it turned out to be an incredibly rare and valuable ‘minting error’, where a blank 10p was accidentally cast as a 2p. \nThe Legion auctioned it for more than £1,400 – but the donor probably didn’t even notice. ‘New pence’ two pence The 1983 'new pence' 2p coin (Photo: BPM) \nAll 2p coins minted before 1982 say ‘new pence’, while those stamped after that date should say ‘two pence’. \nHowever, an early error means that a number of 2p coins from 1983 still show 'new pence', meaning coins with that year stamped on can sell for several hundreds of pounds. Read More The undated 20p (Photo: PA) \nBack in 2008 the Royal Mint printed around 250,000 20 pence pieces with no date on them. \nThe coins are legal tender and so they can be used to buy a Freddo (assuming you have another 5p). However, you’d be better off not selling them as they are still fetching as much as £100 online. The valuable 50ps Olympic Swimmer 50p \nAs mentioned by Philip, the original Olympic aquatic coin with the wavy lines across the swimmer’s face has become very collectible as only 600 were released before the design was changed. \n600 is a tiny, tiny amount in the world of coin collecting and so these coins are changing hands for upwards of £800. Kew Garden 50p \nThe 50 pence coin stamped with the Kew Gardens Pagoda is relatively rare, with just 210,000 minted compared to a standard minting of around 5 million. That means they can sell for £30-£50 if you can find a collector. At their peak demand they were selling online for as much as £120. Peter Rabbit 50p \nThese charming Beatrix Potter coins were released only to a limited number of attractions and National Trust properties and the Royal Mint has not revealed precisely how many it has minted. \nSome are retailing online for between £5 and £15, although some sellers are cheekily trying to sell them for a few hundred. Special editions featuring a range of Beatrix Potter animals in colour are still available via the Royal Mint for £55. The Euro 50p The EC commemorative 50p coin - £20 \nA 1992 50p piece featuring 12 stars and representing the EC Single Market can sell for around £50-£55 online. These are the old-fashioned chunky 50 pences so you are unlikely to turn one up in your change, but it could be worth checking any long-term penny jars for. WWF 50p \nThis commemorative coin is selling for more than £10, even if it has been in circulation a while and is no longer in (literal) mint condition. \nBe careful when buying as some of these standard coins are being advertised at massively inflated prices. However, a few of the rarer editions are selling for hundreds of pounds – so look carefully when comparing. Are you out of your mind, I can’t remember these Rare Coins Slider \nIf you’re not willing to print out and carry this article around in your wallet then there is another option.
