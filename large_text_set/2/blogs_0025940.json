Originally called Skype Access and launched back in 2009, the idea was always to apply to wireless internet access the same principle that Skype applied to the world of calls and texts: offer the same service that the carriers offer, but for free or at a much cheaper price and with a smoother payment system. The service currently covers some 2 million hotspots globally . \nBut in more recent years, it feels like the Skype WiFi service had more or less gone to seed, running with little fanfare, and no word on just how many people used it. It probably also didn’t help that in September last year, Microsoft closed Skype’s London office , its HQ and primary engineering site prior to the Microsoft acquisition, affecting 400 jobs. After a downsizing like that, you should expect some service closures and consolidation. \nAfter Microsoft acquired Skype in May 2011 for $8.5 billion in cash, the software giant mostly said that it would be business as usual with its new, and very popular, internet phone service. And early on, it even put some development attention into the WiFi product. The service was rebranded to Skype WiFi from Skype Access a few months after the Microsoft acquisition, and then iterated here and there, with some free access services added in at select locations. \nCuriously, in 2015, it appeared that Microsoft was planning to launch its own cross-platform WiFi service — but if you visit the page where it is allegedly supposed to be, all that you get is a “coming soon” notice. Meanwhile, Microsoft does appear to have a Microsoft WiFi app to search for and use paid public hotspots under one data plan, although it appears to be just for PCs running Windows. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:21:26.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
