The 15 second-clips were then shown to 57 men and 143 women – all heterosexual and over the age of 18 – in an online study. The participants were then asked to rate the dancing on a scale of 1-7. \nThe results, say Neave, suggest that certain dance moves impressed both men and women. “They were in very strong agreement as to who made a better dancer,” he said. That, he adds, fits in with the idea that dancing is sending signals to both sexes. “Yes, [the women] are dancing to attract men but they are all dancing to show off to other women how good they are,” he said. \nThe preference for certain dance moves in women, says Neave, might offer clues to these potential mates, or competitors. “The way that you move is very crucially linked to your health, your hormonal status and your personality and also possibly things like intelligence and creativity,” he said. “You are seeing someone move and you are able to interpret an awful lot about that person from the way that they move.” \nWhile the team have yet to decode the signals within female dance moves, the authors suggest the preference for hip-swing and arm movements might be down to them being perceived as distinctly feminine traits, while the throwing of asymmetric shapes could offer health clues. “We think what that is showing is that people have then got very good motor control,” he said. But don’t overdo it. While asymmetric thigh moves, arm gestures and hip swing were all given higher ratings, dancers attempting either a lot, or very few, thigh moves or asymmetrical arm gestures were deemed less accomplished that those who used them in moderation.

Credit: Northumbria University \nAlthough Neave admits that dance moves were different in the past – Jane Austen is unlikely to have thrown an impromptu thunder clap move during a country reel – he says the underlying conclusions of the research are widely applicable to music from many different cultures and eras. “We weren’t getting people dancing to music that they hated or that they really liked. We just wanted to see how they moved in time to the rhythm,” he said. “Whatever the music is, it doesn’t matter, if someone is keeping to a rhythm then that signifies a decent dancer.” Rhythm without the blues: how dance crazes make us feel a step closer Read more \nNot everyone is so convinced. “The dancers and people rating the dancing in this study were limited to one – Western – culture, and in other human societies men perform courtship dances – for example the Wodaabe people of Niger,” said Bronwyn Tarr, a dancer and researcher on dance and human evolution from the University of Oxford. “So what counts as attractive dancing will inevitably differ to some degree depending on cultural context.” \nBut, she added, the study ties into wider research delving into the role of dance in snagging a mate. “Studies like this help us build a more complete picture of how we, like many birds and other animals, can use dance to attract attention from the other sex,” she said. “Based on this Western study, those of us looking to up our dancing-game should remember: the hips don’t lie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:40:12.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
