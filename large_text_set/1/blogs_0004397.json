The kid who learned under his father, who watched Elway become the most successful player in Broncos history, who got his first gig as a coordinator under Kubiak, showed all of what he learned, and much more. \nOn Monday, Kubiak stepped down as head coach. And now Kyle Shanahan is among three candidates (so far) who could potentially take over. He is scheduled to interview Saturday. The Broncos will interview Kansas City Chiefs special-teams coordinator Dave Toub on Friday and next week will talk to Vance Joseph, the Miami Dolphins ’ defensive coordinator. \nPlan A for Elway probably will never change; a Super Bowl is the goal every season. But over the years, the path to get there has been refined. \n“I think in today’s world when dealing with players, it’s a different game now than it used to be,” Elway said Monday. “There’s a lot more to that as far as dealing with the different personalities and kids today. So much of it is because everybody is so close. … Obviously there are a lot of young guys out there that have a lot of potential and very bright young guys, so hopefully we can get one of those.” Win McNamee, Getty Images Kyle, left, was Mike’s offensive coordinator in Washington from 2010-13. \nBut there’s a shadow trailing Kyle Shanahan, one that arrived with him to the Broncos’ headquarters as a toddler in the early 1980s and has followed him as he has risen through the NFL coaching ranks. \n“I studied every potential X’s and O’s play and issue possible,” Kyle Shanahan told The Denver Post a decade ago. “I spent my whole life working on that. My goal was that any question a player could have about anything on the field, I’d be able to answer it. There’s more to it. I’m learning that now. You have to communicate with your guys. The guys have to feel comfortable with you. They have to trust you, or they’ll tune you out.” \nAs the son of a two-time Super Bowl-winning Broncos coach, Kyle enters his candidacy with a history and skepticism that neither he nor anyone else may be able to shake. Not completely, anyway. He was by his father’s side when the Broncos won back-to-back Super Bowls. He was at his side again when he was hired as his dad’s offensive coordinator in Washington, from 2010-13. \n“I didn’t really know whether he just got the job because he was Mike’s son or whether he was legit,” admitted former Broncos and Redskins offensive tackle Tyler Polumbus, who played at Cherry Creek High School a few years after Kyle Shanahan did. “I played for a lot of offensive coordinators. Kyle is hands down my favorite. He is an offensive lineman’s best friend, because he builds everything off the run, including the passing game. I was honestly blown away by how smart he is and how well our offense worked, because everything in the passing game for him comes off huge chunk plays. It’s just an extremely effective offense.” \nKyle Shanahan’s offense in Atlanta is built off the West Coast zone blocking system his father and Kubiak ran. \n“But the way he teaches the concepts is different,” Polumbus explained. “Especially in the running game, the landmarks for the offensive linemen are much wider. Everything stretches much farther. Running backs will keep the ball to the play side, whereas with Gary, almost everything falls back to the backside. It’s the same offense, same terminology, but Kyle has evolved it into a different beat.” \nFor the Broncos’ quarterbacks, Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch , a Shanahan hire would offer a smooth transition. \nFor the Broncos’ offense as a whole, he would offer hope of improvement. \nLast year, his first as the Falcons’ coordinator, Atlanta averaged 374.1 yards overall, and 273.7 passing yards, ranking seventh and sixth, respectively, in the NFL. This season, Shanahan has turned the Falcons into one of the most explosive offenses in the league. Atlanta finished 11-5 and ranked No. 1 in the NFL in both yards per play (6.7) and scoring (33.8 points per game). \nSuch numbers were pipe dreams for the Broncos this season. But Elway is searching for more than gaudy numbers in his next head coach. \n“If you know how to motivate a football team and to be able to be on the same page with a football team, I think is as important,” Elway said. “Obviously you want a guy that can manage people and understand what he wants to do on the offensive side as well as the defensive side, but also can manage coaches and manage players, which I think is the biggest part of that job. \n“This is a great place to work, but the expectations are high.” Shanahan2.0 Alex Goodlett, Getty Images Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan looks on during a game against the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium on September 20, 2015 in East Rutherford, N.J. \nKyle Shanahan, 37 \n• Son of former Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan. \n• Played at Duke before transferring to Texas in 2000. \n• Started his NFL coaching career as an offensive quality control coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2004-05). \n• Hired to Gary Kubiak’s staff in Houston, rising from receivers coach (2006) to quarterbacks coach (2007) and then offensive coordinator (2008-09).
