I have no problem with that,\" Clement told Swansea's official website. \n\"What I see in Gylfi is someone who is very motivated to play well here and to keep us in the league. \n\"Every day in training he does the best he can and it is no coincidence that he is a very good player. The top players have talent, but they also have an unbelievable work ethic. Gylfi has that. \n\"We have not had one conversation about him playing anywhere else and that's not a worry for me. Our focus is on Middlesbrough.\" \nSwansea, currently 17th in the Premier League table, entertain fellow strugglers Middlesbrough - managed by caretaker boss Steve Agnew after Aitor Karanka's departure - on Sunday, hoping to avoid a third consecutive Premier League defeat and increase their three-point lead over 18th-placed Hull City. \n\"Steve has had one game in charge and I have watched that game closely to see if there have been any significant changes,\" said Clement. \n\"I thought they played well against Manchester United â€“ 3-1 flattered United a little bit. They will be organised and they will be looking to come here and win.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T03:13:14.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
