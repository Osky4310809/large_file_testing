You’re not going to die alone. \nYou just haven’t met someone who meets your standards, and as a Capricorn , those can be very high. \nCapricorns choose partners who are ambitious. In fact, they love to date “up,” meaning you like someone who has access to VIPs or who will at least impress the VIPs in your own life. \nAdding to your high standards as a Capricorn, you’re a Taurus Rising. This makes you incredibly (how do I put this?) stubborn AF. \nYou’re set in your ways, and you want a partner you can show off. You also want someone you can really call your own because people with Taurus Rising are incredibly possessive. \nBut here’s where it gets tough for you. \nYour Moon is in Aquarius , meaning inwardly, you are desperately attached to your personal independence and thrilled by the freedom to pick up and do your own damn thing whenever you damn please. \nIt can be difficult to find a partner when you want complete ownership of them , but you also want to remain a free agent. \nIt might benefit you to balance these opposing desires and to take stock of what areas you’d be willing to compromise. \nThe first step toward loving someone else is gaining a greater awareness of yourself, Capricorn. \nOnce you do find your special someone, your chart suggests that you will make a fantastic partner. You’ll be protective, yet lovingly detached when your partner needs you to give them space. \nPretty much anyone would be lucky to have you. You just might have to gain a little more self-awareness first. \nAnd to answer the last part of your question, no, the stars are not telling you anything. \nBut, your life might be reflecting something you’ve been telling yourself: For now, perhaps you really are better off alone. Otherwise, you’d be with someone already! \nYou are the one who designs your own life. \nIt should be of comfort to you that you cannot possibly die alone, unless, of course, that’s what you want. \nAnd if that’s what you really, truly want deep down, then there’s nothing to worry about! \nXO, \nRosebud \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
