A photo posted by New York Knicks �� (@nyknicks) on Jan 27, 2017 at 3:47pm PST \nHenry's goalscoring prowess was well-documented throughout his career, but Knick fans might be wondering if the 39-year-old can hit a jumpshot. New York are losers of 15 of their last 20 games and are outside of the playoff picture in the Eastern Conference. \nSo what do you think Thierry? The Knicks could use a hand if you want to lace up the high tops and bring some of that magic back to the hardwood. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:38:49.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
