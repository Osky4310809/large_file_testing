The two so-called “stateless refugees” — so identified because they arrived in Sweden without identification papers and consequently can’t be deported — have been jailed for the rape which took place in Malmo, Sweden in March 2016. While the Swedish court has not identified the criminals, Sweden’s Fria Tider (Free Times) has named the jailed men as 28-year-old Khaled Azez Hegrs and 23-year-old Tareq Bakkar, both of no fixed address. It is reported the men are from Kuwait and Syria respectively, and neither speak Swedish without a translator. The court heard how the 23-year-old female victim was kidnapped at Gunpoint in Helsingborg, reports Swedish daily newspaper Expressen, before being driven 60 kilometres south to Malmo. The men covered the security cameras covering the basement of a Shisha-coffee shop in the city before taking the woman below — where she told officers other migrant men were waiting. The men were described as having “exhibited particular ruthlessness and brutality”. While the victim told police the men took turns in raping her either singly or in pairs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T04:02:19.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
