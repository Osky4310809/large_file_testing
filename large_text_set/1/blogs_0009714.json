Photo: Adobe Research/YouTube \nGreat photographers often employee great assistants. Ansel Adams hired master darkroom technicians who printed to his exact specifications and the lush lighting in an Annie Leibovitz portrait come from trusted assistants who understand her vision. \nAdobe is working to bring photographers of all levels a valued assistant – and the voice of that assistant may sound familiar. \nA video produced by Adobe Research shows a man giving voice commands to an iPad to crop a photo and prepare it to post on Facebook. The voice coming from the iPad sounds like Siri as it repeats the commands of the photographer. \nIt is a 40-second video, showing just a few voice-commanded steps to work what appear to be the basic editing tools featured with the device’s native camera. But the video offers a glimpse into a post-production future that needs no mouse, trackpad or keystrokes. The video was posted to YouTube by Adobe Research on Tuesday and is making the rounds on photography websites, like iso1200 and PetaPixel , which were among the first to break the story.\nAdobe Research “is exploring what an intelligent digital assistant photo editing might look like,” the research team wrote in the introduction to the video on YouTube. “To envision this, we combined the emerging science of voice interaction with deep understanding of both creative workflows and the creative aspirations of our customers. \n“Our speech recognition system is able to directly accept natural user voice instructions for image editing either local through on-device computer or through a cloud-based Natural Language understanding service. This is the first step towards a robust multimodal voice-based interface which allows our creative customers to search and edit images in an easy and engaging way.” \nWhile the voice interface is cool, I am intrigued by this phrase: deep understanding of both creative workflows and creative aspirations. \nToning a photo in Photoshop can be a very nuanced, precise and time-consuming step-by-step process. The end results are subjective and based on the tastes of the individual photographer. How casual a user can be with language is not clear but it is likely that should voice command be available for a sophisticated program, like Photoshop, a user will have to apply certain words for tools, their settings and actions. \nBut could voice commands be used to skip the technical steps all together? \nIn 2014, Adobe and MIT made public its research on building complex algorithms based on the signature styles of different acclaimed photographers . You might not be able to afford to hire Martin Schoeller to shoot your LinkedIn mug, but you could take a selfie and hit a pre-set to bring his look to your otherwise drab photo. \nImagine a single voice command for that photo you made at Yosemite over the summer that goes something like, “Make it look like an Ansel Adams print.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T00:57:01.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
