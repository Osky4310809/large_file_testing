There is no denying that on his birthday, today, mile-long pieces will be written to glorify his resolve as an always-relevant artist. However, abnormally less is spoken about his courage to tear through Indian masculinities, and tear up over sensitive matters, judgement notwithstanding. We love ourselves a man who doesn’t fear letting his emotions run wild and free. Aamir, since it’s yo birthday, here’s looking at your 400-crore-worthy salty pearls of modern masculinity and haila! expression. 1. It all began with Satyamev Jayate, where we saw how the actor just couldn’t keep it together. 2. It became increasingly difficult for the actor to contain himself from endless grief. 3. The pain was too real. 4. And then it was everywhere, the Aamir-Khan crying face. 5. There were waterworks at movie screenings… 6. And, press conferences. 7. Hell, the man even cried after watching the Salman Khan-starrer, Sultan . 8. Somebody has got to stop peeling onions around him ALL THE TIME. 9. We need a man who looks at our naked bodies the way Aamir Khan looks at reporters who question his nationality. 10. Oh Aamir, just continue with them tears!
