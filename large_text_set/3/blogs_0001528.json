They later reportedly confronted some other policemen found in area and engaged them in a free for all. \nOur correspondent learnt that the development created panic in the area as other banks – Fidelity, Skye, Zenith and Diamond – on the street immediately shut down operations, while traders on the road closed shops. \nIt took the combined efforts of senior police officers and men of the Military Police officers to restore peace, as the injured air force officer was rushed to a hospital. \nThe First Bank branch, where the incident occurred, was forced to close for the day, as armed policemen cordoned off the facility and denied customers access to the premises. \nThe state Commissioner of Police, Taiwo Lakanu, said he had yet to be briefed about the incident. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:09:21.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
