Plus Adelaide’s earpieces explained and the Pie girls showing the Pie boys up. \nSome key takings from the first three games of Round 2 of AFLW. \nTHE BLUE BOYS’ BEAUTIFUL GESTURE \nIT WAS a busy afternoon for the Carlton Football Club on Saturday. \nNot only did the Blues host two AFLW games at Ikon Park — one game featured their own side — they also held their family day on the northern lawn of Princes Park, which saw the majority of the men’s team in attendance. \nAnd the Blue boys won plenty of fans as their female counterparts entered the arena ahead of the Carlton-GWS clash. \nAlmost the entire Blues’ male playing list formed a guard of honour for the club’s AFLW side as skipper Lauren Arnell led her teammates through the banner. media_camera Carlton’s men’s team formed a guard of honour for Lauren Arnell and her AFLW teammates. Picture: Wayne Ludbey \nStar on-baller Bryce Gibbs was at the front of the cue, applauding and encouraging the girls as they stepped onto the Ikon Park turf. \nIt was a touching moment for the club, which has made giant strides over recent years in trying to rid itself of a ‘boys club’ tag. media_camera Bryce Gibbs leads the applause for Carlton’s AFLW team. \nThe Blues would go on to register an impressive comeback victory over the Giants, ensuring they remained undefeated across the early stages of the competition. \n“I think we’ve proven to ourselves that if we have the momentum we can get something out of the game, like last week, and if we’re challenged we can still get there as well,” Carlton coach Damien Keeping said. \n“It goes back to the character of the group and their preparedness and readiness to meet any challenge that’s put in front of them. \n“The playing group is committed to the program and we’ve been getting the benefits of that commitment right from the word go.” The @CarltonFC blokes lining up as the @CarltonFC women's team runs through the banner! #AFLW #AFLWBluesGiants pic.twitter.com/lUPOBoWaX2 — Andrew Donnison (@Donno79) February 11, 2017 \nTHE STRANGE LOOKING EARPIECES EXPLAINED \nTHE ear accessories worn by Adelaide’s AFLW players on Friday night had some on-lookers scratching their heads. \nBut the girls are wearing them for a very good and productive reason. \nCrows female players are wearing earpieces throughout the entire AFLW season as part of AFL-endorsed concussion testing. \nThe sensors, which are taped behind the left ear of each player, pick up data throughout games, such as force of hits and the speed of head jolts in a collision. \nIt’s all part of a project surrounding the long-term effects and concerns of concussion. \nAll eight AFLW teams have been invited to wear the sensors, with only the Crows and Melbourne taking up the offer to date. \nThe AFL also confirmed on Sunday that the earpieces would also be worn by some men’s teams during the upcoming JLT Community Series. media_camera Adelaide’s Chelsea Randall is seen wearing the earpiece. \nTHE EXPLOSIVE ON-BALLERS CLEARING CONGESTION \nEVEN with the 16-a-side structure, congestion has been consistent feature throughout the early stages of the AFLW competition. \nBut a handful of exciting, explosive midfielders are doing their best to not only clear the ball from stoppages, but also set up score opportunities for their teammates. \nMelbourne is blessed to have two of those types of players in on-ballers Elise O’Dea and Karen Paxman, who both showed great energy and pace when clearing congestion at Ikon Park. \nO’Dea was particularly impressive against Collingwood on Saturday night, finishing with 15 disposals — six of which came in the final term — five clearances, nine tackles and a whopping 309m gained. Paxman was just as influential, racking up 15 touches and 213m gained. \nThe competition’s leading ball-winner is Bulldog Emma Kearney, whose acceleration stood out despite her side’s loss to the Crows. Kearney backed up her 23 touches in Round 1 with another 23 in Round 2, but her four clearances, five inside 50s and game-high 746m gained proved she’s arguably the most explosive player in the competition. \nFor Adelaide, Ebony Marinoff, 19, is quickly establishing herself as the favourite to take out the Rising Star award, standing out with her pace and class with the ball. She racked up a team-high 18 disposals to go with six clearances and 515m gained. \nThese are the girls who hold the key to breaking AFLW games open. Perkins' huge roost 0:29 \nAFLW: Sarah Perkins continues to live up to her new cult figure status, with two first-half goals against the Bulldogs.
