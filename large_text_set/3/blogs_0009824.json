Of all the names associated with the Steelers recently, Adam Schefter of ESPN had news of a very unexpected free agent heading to Pittsburgh.\nAfter visiting the NY Jets, Patriots free-agent LB Dont'a Hightower is scheduled to visit the Steelers, per source.\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 13, 2017 \nBefore fans got too excited about the report, it should be understood there is a very good chance Dont’a Hightower never gets out of New York without a deal. There is also no guarantee Pittsburgh is the next team Hightower is set to visit or that another one will not present itself as a more attractive option to visit before hand.\nSelected by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft from the Universtiy of Alabama, Hightower was a team captain last season. Over his career, he has recorded 17 sacks, with just two and half coming last year. The Patriots are also apparently keen to retain him if they can.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:33:17.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
