She couldn’t.\nShe cannot walk, talk or move most of her body.\nBut that has not stopped her, and thousands of others with disabilities, from making their thoughts and fears about a Donald Trump presidency heard. Organizers with the Women’s March estimate that among their remarkable attendance numbers were tens of thousands of people with disabilities, marking possibly the largest organized gathering for this group. But for all those who attended, there were others who wanted to be there but remained homebound, unable to stand for too long, or navigate the trip in a wheelchair or handle the crowds. They, too, found a way to be vocal, if not visible.\nWhen Sonya Huber launched the website Disability March as a way to give people like herself, who wouldn’t be able to physically attend a demonstration, a place to express themselves online, she envisioned maybe 50 people would participate. Instead, she and other volunteers heard from several thousand individuals who didn’t just share their perspective for the weekend event, but have kept talking through social media, questioning how they can continue to remain involved.\nThis group of unexpected activists speak to how Trump — who before the election mocked a reporter’s disability and who in recent days has taken steps toward dismantling the Affordable Care Act — is mobilizing even those who aren’t easily mobile.\n“The clear question we’re hearing now from folks is ‘What’s next?’” said Huber, a professor in Connecticut who suffers from chronic pain as a result of autoimmune diseases. “It makes you just think about how no matter what condition a person is in they are part of the body politics and they want a voice.”\nSome of those who joined the Disability March live in the Washington region, so close to Saturday’s gathering that, if they had been able to, they could have taken an Uber. Others hail from places where no marches were being held. Some have physical disabilities; others mental.\nSome, like Smith, can’t talk, even if they have much to say.\nThe 44-year-old has locked-in syndrome and can move only one eye. She looks up for yes, and down for no. She also spells using eye movement and the assistance of her mother, Priscilla Smith. Together, they wrote the short essay that appeared on the Disability March site.\n“I worry about the health of America,” it reads. In it, Phoebe Smith, who was in college studying to be a teacher when she developed a blood clot in her brainstem, expressed concern that Trump picked Betsy DeVos for education secretary. She also wrote that she “shudders” at the idea of being in the same room as the 45th president. “He, and other Republicans, now plan to lessen medical, Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid coverage for the elderly, poor and disabled. They claim to represent Christians, but do not follow Christ’s lead.”\nShe ended the essay ends with a famous Quote: : “You measure the degree of civilization of a society by how it treats its weakest members.”\nHuber said she and 20 volunteers continue to work to post all the responses they received, about 3,000 from people ages five to 92. Many, she said, expressed fears about health care instability and the loss of Medicaid benefits. Others told of concerns about what will happen under Trump’s administration to children with disabilities in schools.\nAlmost all of them, Huber said, expressed gratitude to be able to participate in the protests.\n“It almost brings me to tears,” Huber said. “For many people it’s the first time they have been really visible in a public way. That was something I hadn’t thought about when I started it.”\nHuber, 45, said the idea for the site came to her as she looked for a way to attend a march and knew that if she tried to go, it would leave her physically exhausted.\nAndrea Scarpino, who knew Huber from graduate school and helped her get the site started, said she was surprised by the number of responses but not with the fears expressed in them. Scarpino, who suffers from chronic pain, said people with disabilities already feel on the margins and Trump has not done much to put their worries at ease. The day after the inauguration, the new White House’s website had removed a page that under the Obama administration was dedicated to the rights of people with disabilities.\n“We feel vulnerable with this administration, more vulnerable than we have in a very long time,” Scarpino said. The task now, she said, is how to make sure that people who now feel involved in the conversation stay a part of it moving forward. “I think we all have a sense of wanting to continue this movement and wanting to continue to make our voices heard.”\nMia Ives-Rublee, who headed the disabilities caucus for the Women’s march, said that an estimated 45,000 individuals with disabilities attended the Women’s March in Washington, a number organizers are basing on how many people expressed a need for a special accommodation. The March had an ADA tent, and provided handicap- accessible portable toilets and ASL interpretation, among other services. It also dedicated 200 volunteers to helping people with disabilities.\n“I think we are extremely pumped to be included in this march and it is a starting point for other social movements to really see how we can start to integrate accessibility needs and disability rights,” said Ives-Rublee who has brittle bone syndrome and uses a wheelchair. She said women with disabilities should be at the table for discussions on women’s rights because they have much at stake: They are more likely to be victims of sexual violence and get paid 39 cents to ever dollar a man without a disability earns.\nIves-Rublee said she was also encouraged to see the online representation of people who couldn’t make it to the march.\n“I want to create more of a collaboration with them and really ensure that all voices are heard,” she said. “I think it is important that we realize that there are people who aren’t able to get to these marches.”\nRead more:\nShe inspired those with Down syndrome as unstoppable — until she wasn’t\nWoman with Down syndrome prevails over parents in guardianship case\nMan with Down syndrome who died in police custody loved law enforcement\nQuestions haunt the family of man with Down syndrome who died in custody", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@TheresaVargas1"], "published": "2017-01-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T07:35:07.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
