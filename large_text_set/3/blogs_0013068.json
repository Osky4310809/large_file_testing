The Tech Insider team's reaction upon laying eyes on the Retro iPhone 7 Plus was quick and positively conclusive, with proclamations like \"I'd buy,\" and \" like.\" \nWho's responsible for such a marvel? The same company that's been coloring Apple's Airpods: Colorware . \nBut I digress, because this is all about the Retro iPhone 7 Plus. \nThe Retro iPhone 7 Plus starts its life as a regular unlocked 256GB black iPhone 7 Plus, which costs $969. Then, Colorware adds its Retro paint job on top for an additional $930 for a total of $1,899. The first 25 of the Retro iPhones will come with a \"number of authenticity\" for a boost of exclusivity. \nNote the \"1 of 25\" towards the bottom. \nCommon sense and restraint set in when the team realized its insanely high price tag. \nWith that said, however, the retr0 80's style beige is a truly becoming color on the iPhone, and it looks good on other gadgets, too, like this retro Apple Watch charging stand : \nNot that it matters for most people on a budget, but it's only available for a limited time. Perhaps someone will come up with an 80's electronics beige iPhone case that's a little more affordable, like the case made by Schreer Delights for the iPhone 4 and 4s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:08:22.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
