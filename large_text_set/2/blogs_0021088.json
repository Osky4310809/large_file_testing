Noel was dealt to the Dallas Mavericks for Justin Anderson , Andrew Bogut and what will likely be two second round picks.\nSixers fans aren’t pleased.\nColangelo trading Nerlens and keeping Okafor would be a great way to ensure that Philly never ever ever forgives him\n— Andrew Sharp (@andrewsharp) February 23, 2017 Two points of clarity:\n\n1. Jahlil Okafor is not Joel Embiid insurance in any way.\n\n2. Jahlil Okafor should not play next to Joel Embiid.\n— Kyle Neubeck (@KyleNeubeck) February 23, 2017 Not only can Okafor not play next to Embiid, but he’s been a complete disaster when he plays at all this year. Okafor isn’t a passer, doesn’t space the floor, and lineups with him are outscored by nearly 16 points per 100 possessions this season, the worst in Philadelphia.\nIt appeared that Okafor was nearly traded to New Orleans about two weeks ago, which would have likely ruined any chance for the DeMarcus Cousins trade. Other deals were rumored, and Okafor didn’t even travel with the team during one road trip before joining them a game later.\nAfter all that, Okafor remains with Philadelphia while Noel is the one who was shipped out. That’s the most baffling part of all this.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:57:35.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
