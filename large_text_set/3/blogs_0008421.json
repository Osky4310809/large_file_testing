Crystal earned up to $30,000 a month during her adult career (Photo: Barcroft Media) Crystal used to live a lavish lifestyle in Hollywood (Photo: Barcroft Media) \nShe spent a few years modelling and pole dancing before an adult film agent told her she could make $30,000 (£25,000) a month by starring in porn films. \nRemembering her first scene at a house in Malibu, she said: \"I sat in the shower for about two hours crying. Then I stopped after that shoot and didn't go back for about one month. \n\"I ended up going back to it again and that's when I was numbing myself through taking pain medicine and drinking alcohol to get through the scene. She spent the cash on a mansion and sports cars (Photo: Barcroft Media) But she also fell into a cycle of alcohol abuse (Photo: Barcroft Media) \n\"It just became like this daily routine for me where I would drop my son off to school in the morning, go do a shoot and come home. It was like a regular 9 to 5 job.\" \nCrystal said she became sucked in by her materialistic lifestyle as she splashed the cash on a mansion, night club and sports cars while her alcohol abuse worsened.

She worked in the adult industry for 10 years (Photo: Barcroft Media) But she quit the industry three years ago to devote herself to God (Photo: Barcroft Media) \n\"I started to become an object. I wouldn't walk outside my house without showing cleavage, having a belly shirt on and high heels. It was like had to constantly look like the sex symbol.\" \nCrystal decided to quit porn three years ago after choosing to devote herself to God. \nSoon afterwards she met David, a church minister. The pair married in December 2014 and shortly afterwards welcomed their son Carter. \nShe added: \"He'd known about my past for years because my sister was going to his church. David is the kind of guy that thinks your past is your past. You can't keep looking back at it. It's done with. Crystal now works as a church minister in New York (Photo: Barcroft Media) She married David, a church minister, and the couple welcomed a son (Photo: Barcroft Media) \n\"It is definitely the ultimate change. It's going from one extreme to the next. I had to get away from this whole life.\" \nDavid, 26, said: \"What I would like people to take away from us is that God can forgive you no matter what past you come from. \n\"I would like people to come to Christ through our relationship and our experiences. I hope it encourages everybody else to do the same, to realise that money and fame isn't what it's about.\" Read More \nThe pair have set up the New Beginnings Christian Life in Fulton, New York and said they hope to inspire others to turn to religion.

I probably would be completely different. \n\"My past made me who I am today and God has changed my life completely.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T14:25:28.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
