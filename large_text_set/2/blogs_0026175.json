(Photo: Getty Images) Spurs will have 17,000 seats in a single stand at their new stadium (Photo: Tottenham Hotspur) \nSpeaking in the above video, the Tottenham chairman says: \"The first challenge we gave our architects was 'how can we try and retain the atmosphere that currently exists in our stadium here, because it is a very tight bowl?' \n\"So we are in fact five metres closer to the pitch than a comparable stadium in north London...\" \nAfter his cheeky comment, which apparently goes completely unnoticed, Levy continues to discuss the stadium and says he hopes it will have a stand comparable to Dortmund's Yellow Wall. \n\"We are the only stadium in the UK that will have 17,000 seats in the single stand,\" explained the Spurs chairman. \nAnd we have to admit, that does sound pretty impressive. poll loading Will Tottenham finish in the top four? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:19:00.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
