South films are terrific when it comes to stories and execution. Some films are so good that many hit Bollywood films are inspired from them, or are their remake. We also cannot ignore the hotties that work in the southern film industry. Come on, didn't your heart skip-a-beat when Rana Daggubati made a cameo in the film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani ? These actors are made to live life on edge in their films, and are made to look God-like on-screen. Here are some actors we love from the southern industry. Ajith Kumar \nPopularly known as Thala by his fans, this 57-year-old actor gives tough competition to actors half his age. He will soon be seen in an upcoming action film, Vivegam . The actor had to go through extreme physical transformation to get his look right. Prabhas \nHe nailed it in the amazing action-drama film, Baahubali -also one of the highest grossing films of 2015. Prabhas could effortlessly portray the lead character of Baahubali , and we just cannot wait to see him again in the sequel of the movie. Rana Daggubati \nRana made his Hindi movie debut with the film, Dum Maaro Dum , and became the talk of the town. His tall body and muscular physique made him popular among the masses. Although, he played an antagonist in Baahubali , he gave tough competition to the lead actor, Prabhas. We wish to see more of this hottie in Bollywood as well. Ram Charan \nThis south star made his Hindi film debut with the remake of Amitabh Bachchan's blockbuster, Zanjeer . Although the film didn't do well at the box-office, Ram Charan was appreciated for his acting and his tough looks. He is well-known for films like Chirutha and Magadheera . We think he should try his luck in Bollywood, again.
