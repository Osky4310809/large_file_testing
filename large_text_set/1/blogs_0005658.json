Coming in third was another word employed by the political left: \"Normalize,\" meaning \"to render normal that which was previously deemed beyond acceptable bounds.\" \nIn the category of \"Political Word of the Year,\" top honors went to \"post-truth\" — defined as \"belonging to a time in which facts matter less than beliefs or emotions.\" \nOther nominees in the category included \"deplorables\" (the infamous moniker Hillary Clinton gave to some Donald Trump supporters), \"nasty woman\" (what Trump called Clinton during the third presidential debate), \"Pantsuit Nation\" (the popular Facebook group and hashtag used by Clinton supporters), and \"unpresidented\" (the erroneous spelling of \"unprecedented\" Trump used in a post-election tweet. \nBut politically-charged words creeped into other categories as well. \"Gaslight,\" a verb meaning to manipulate someone psychologically by causing them to question their own sanity, won the superlative \"Most Useful.\" The word spiked in usage during the presidential campaign to describe the actions of Republican lawmakers and Trump surrogates, who often contradicted Trump in TV interviews. \nMeanwhile, \"locker-room banter\" took home the dubious honor of \"Euphemism of the Year.\" The Trump campaign made use of the phrase to dismiss the nominee's lewd language following the leak of an Access Hollywood tape in October. Coming up short in that category was \"alt-right,\" a catch-all descriptor for a faction of ultra-conservatives with white nationalist or anti-Semitic ideologies. \nIn the category of \"Digital Word of the Year\" the symbol @ — used as a verb, as in \"Don't @ me\" — barely edged out \"tweetstorm.\" \nThe American Dialect Society has voted on the Word of the Year annually since 1990. Previous winners include \"Y2K\" in 1999, \"metrosexual\" in 2003, and the hashtag \"occupy\" in 2011. Last year's winner was \"they,\" which gained traction as a gender-neutral, singular pronoun in 2015. View all the nominees and winners below (winners in bold): \nHillary Clinton.
