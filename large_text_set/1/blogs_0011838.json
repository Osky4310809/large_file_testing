Toyota Yaris hot hatch – Geneva debut, over 210 hp! / 7 comments \nToyota has released the first official photos of the performance-oriented Toyota Yaris variant that it promised late last year. The B-segment hot hatch, widely-tipped to be called the Yaris Gazoo (in honour of the works Toyota Gazoo Racing team), will mark the first proper small hot hatch from the brand since the turbocharged Starlet models in the 1990s. \nSaid to be inspired by the Yaris WRC , the new car gets few unique cues that differentiate it from the standard facelifted Yaris that was also just introduced. There’s a rear spoiler, a rear diffuser with a large, centrally-mounted exhaust tip and larger 17-inch alloy wheels. The aggressive front bumper and side skirts of the Yaris TGR concept due to be shown at the 2017 Tokyo Auto Salon are nowhere to be found, unfortunately. \nNo technical details have been revealed just yet, but Toyota says that the hot Yaris will pump out over 210 hp from an unspecified engine. That engine is most probably a 1.5 litre turbocharged mill from the C-HR Racing , which was raced at the Nürburgring 24 Hours last year – although Auto Express reports that an uprated version of the standard Yaris Hybrid ‘s powertrain is just as likely. \nThe rest of the Yaris lineup gets a more aggressive front end, a sportier rear bumper, wider two-piece tail lights and optional LED headlights. Inside, there are minor trim changes, while driving dynamics have been improved with increased spot welds, a thicker instrument panel brace and new dampers. The Hybrid model has also finally been introduced in Japan, a few years after Europe. \nWhat do you think, guys – this, the Ford Fiesta ST or the Peugeot 208 GTi ? Sound off in the comments section after the jump. \nGALLERY: Toyota Yaris facelift", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:21:14.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
