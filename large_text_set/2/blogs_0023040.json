As soon as we stopped saying that at Team Penske we had a lot more success. I think it’s a lot more about culture than anything else.” \nKeselowski said having fast cars helps, too. \n“It’s about more than me,” he said. “You have to have the right car to do it and the cars right now are really lending themselves to drivers being able to make moves and establish position to dominate a race and I think we’ve capitalized well on that with Team Penske.” \nSunday, we’ll see if one of the Penske Fords can win the Great American Race again. It should be quite a battle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:04:49.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
