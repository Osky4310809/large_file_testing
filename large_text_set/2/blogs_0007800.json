Now a new report claims that same phone will be sold in some countries under a different name – the Huawei Nova Lite.\nSee also: Huawei CEO Richard Yu talks new partnerships, growth in interview at CES 2017 January 6, 2017 This report is based on a Twitter post by noted gadget leaker Evan “@evleaks” Blass, where he shows what looks a sales banner for both the P8 Lite (2017) and the Nova Lite. Both show the same phone and even the same slogan, “Power Without Pause”.\n\nBlass’ Twitter post did not indicate where the phone would be sold under the Nova Lite brand. It’s possible that Huawei wants to market this phone with the new name in places where the P8 Lite was not previously sold.\nThe Huawei P8 Lite (2017)/Huawei Nova Lite includes a 5.2-inch Full HD display, the Kirin 655 processor, 3GB of RAM and 16GB of on-board storage. It also comes with a 12MP rear camera and an 8MP front-facing selfie camera. Finally it has a 3,000mAh battery, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, and Android 7.0 Nougat with Huawei’s latest EMUI 5.0 user interface.\nThe phone has already gone on sale in the UK and parts of Europe , under the P8 Lite (2017) branding. UK residents can get the phone for £185 without a contract, while other parts of Europe can buy it for €240. The phone will be sold in black, white and gold versions under both the P8 Lite (2017) and the Nova Lite branding. There’s no word when or even if the phone will make an official debut in the US, and if it is coming to our neck of the woods, there’s no telling which brand name will be chosen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:25:49.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
