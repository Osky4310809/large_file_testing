And unlike most taxes, the debate isn’t necessarily a partisan one. \nRed states such as Utah, Georgia and Wyoming all have increased gas taxes in recent years, and conservative Indiana is among those considering a gas tax hike in 2017. \nSo why not Colorado? \n“It’s not just the matter of gas taxes. It’s a matter of taxes, period,” says John Straayer, a political science professor at Colorado State University who specializes in legislative politics. \n“I’d characterize it as the fifth book in the New Testament,” Straayer added. “Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and TABOR.” \nSince the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights was adopted in 1992, voters in Colorado have authorized only one tax hike put on the ballot by lawmakers: the 2013 measure taxing recreational marijuana . Four citizen-led initiatives to increases taxes — including one for tobacco products in 2016 — failed in recent years. \nSo the politics involved in putting a measure on the ballot in the first place — coupled with the likelihood that it could fail, given voters’ typically anti-tax disposition — have made lawmakers and advocacy groups cautious about what they put forward. \nMeanwhile, small government groups and many Republicans question the need for new revenue at all. If transportation’s a priority, they argue, it can be funded with the money the state already brings in. \n“At this point, we have enough revenue to deal with this,” said Michael Fields, the state director for Americans for Prosperity. \nTo be clear, not everyone is ruling out gas taxes. Democrats, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, are quick to point to the state’s Republican-led neighbor, Utah, as a model. In 2015, Utah lawmakers voted to bump their 24.5-cent-per-gallon gas tax up by 5 cents. That’s 33 percent higher than what Colorado charges. \nBut the comparison is imperfect: The Utah legislature didn’t need the approval of voters. \nRep. Diane Mitsch Busch, the Democrat in charge of the House transportation committee, acknowledges that no one has ever successfully raised the gas tax at the ballot box. But, she adds, “nobody’s ever tried it,” either. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:32:55.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
