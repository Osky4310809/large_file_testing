Play Library originally opened as a popup in the Globe Gallery across from Findlay Market. It's celebrating its grand opening at 1517 Elm St. in OTR on March 15. The Play Library, seen here in its popup form, is opening a permanent location in… more Provided The library is the brainchild of former toy design manager Julia Fischer . \"The popup was so successful, we decided to keep the idea going,\" she told me. \"Our goal is to get families to play together and connect, so we have stuff that appeals to all ages, not just little kid things.\" All of the library's games are free to play in its physical location, which is housed in 1,065 square feet. The library has new and classic board and card games but also classic video game systems to allow parents (or nostalgic millennials like myself) to play systems from their youth with their kids. The Play Library will also continue a tradition started with the popup of having late-night game events for adults. Those were sponsored by Rhinegeist in the past, but Fischer said she'll be reaching out to other breweries as well. Members of the library will be able to take the games home. Rentals last two weeks, but there are no late fees. Fischer compares it to Netflix, saying people will be allowed to take out a new game once they return what they already have. She's still setting up the fee structure, but fees will be based on the number of games people want to be able to take out at a time. The library also allows companies or families to sponsor memberships for low-income families. \"I'm trying to get the cost down as low as possible,\" Fischer said. \"I don't want anyone to feel that they can't access our space.\" Hours: 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. Brownfield covers retail and restaurants, technology, manufacturing and courts.
