This has surprised various figures in political and media circles since Trump allegedly told Bharara back in November that he wanted the attorney to keep his job. \nDuring his analysis, Toobin noted that Bharara’s position made him privy to numerous political developments and investigations pertaining to Trump, including the president’s connection to Russia. Toobin also noted that Bharara no longer has access to new information about Trump that he might’ve disclosed if he were not newly cut off from the Justice Department. \n“The question arises,” Toobin said, “Is there something either that the Trump administration doesn’t want Preet Bharara to pursue, or are there things he knows that he might disclose later that could be troublesome for the Trump administration.” \nToobin also echoed Don Lemon ‘s sentiments from Friday night, saying that the Trump administration’s decision might’ve been their way of taking advice from Fox’s Sean Hannity about expelling bureaucratic “saboteurs” from the government. \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:36:27.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
