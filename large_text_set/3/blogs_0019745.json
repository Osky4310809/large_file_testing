Michelle talks to Sharon (Photo: BBC) \nWhile another shared: \"That was not Sharon's voice on the phone. Dennis has a secret mother.\" \nA third wrote: \"What DEMON did they get to do Sharon's voiceover?\" \nAfter catching wind of the comments, the soap's director Kate Saxon took to Twitter to clear up any confusion. \n\"It is Sharon Mitchell/ Letitia Dean on the phone,\" she wrote before adding, \"I directed the episode - including her recording.\" \nKate then explained why she decided to include Sharon actress Letitia Dean's voice. \n\"I prefer doing so, as when I'm in a room with someone else on their mobile, I can generally hear the other end of the call.\" \nAnd Letitia was included in the episode's credits as was Kellie Bright who was also heard but not seen during a phone call.
