King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 0 \nGuitar instructor Darrell Brown presented a concise video lesson on how to play the infamously tricky F chord in 5 different, significantly easier ways. \nThe musician explained: \"When I was learning the F chord, I was taught these two ways: \n\"Both are quite difficult for a new player, especially when you have to bring them up to speed and change between other chords. So today we're gonna look at five easier ways to play the F chord to help you guys out.\" \nYou can check out the stuff below, make sure to watch the video for musical demonstration. 1) F/A \n\"Instead of having the F note as the base of your chord, we'll have the A as the base of your chord.\" 2) Fadd9 \n\"You still have your F, A, and C, and then you use your pinky to play the high G.\" 3) Fmaj7 \"You just need F, A, and C, and the first string can ring open.\" 4) Fmaj7sus2 \n\"You only need two fingers.\" 5) F/C \n\"This is a great one when you need a little extra low end. Instead of having F as the basis of your chord, you're gonna have C as the basis of your chord.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:42:10.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
