Live television cameras were rolling, but Shaw seemingly decided the 2-0 match was out of reach and decided to chow down next to his team’s bench.

Maybe he was getting an energy boost in case he needed to sub in. \nIt’s not all that surprising. This is the team that had a coach vaping in the sideline during a match. But, in a plot twist, the fun quickly turned into a conspiracy as some incredulous fans wondered if the second-half snack was pre-planned: Name a more iconic duo, we'll wait...Wayne Shaw To Eat A Pie Live On Air = 8/1 https://t.co/RbjPZpZ6NK #FACup #SUTARS pic.twitter.com/0YbfWbsHJh — Sun Bets (@SunBets) February 20, 2017 \nSutton, an underdog in this FA Cup, signed a deal with The Sun newspaper’s betting outfit and a tweet earlier on Monday from Sun Bets seemed to foretell the meat pie feast on live TV. \nAfter the match, they followed up with the announcement that the live pie-eating moment earned some betters a handsome payout.

It’s all a little too perfect, no? \nPre-planned or not, Shaw certainly looked like he enjoyed his FA Cup pie. And the fact that he was willing to do that makes him the Man of the Match anyway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:29:37.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
