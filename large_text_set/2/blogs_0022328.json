So this smells like an entire stockyard full of bulls: \nThe annual Conservative Political Action Conference began Thursday morning outside Washington, DC, with a strange denunciation of the movement by the executive director of the organization behind the event. In a speech titled \"The Alt Right Ain't Right at All,\" American Conservative Union executive director Dan Schneider said that the alt-right isn't really a conservative movement at all. Instead, he said, \"a hate-filled, left-wing fascist group hijacked the very term 'alt-right.'\" Schneider called the alt-right anti-Semitic, racist, and sexist. \nThat CPAC would take the trouble of trying to distance itself from the alt-right shows that the brand has become toxic—people noticed that “alt-right” translates to “white supremacist.” But saying “that’s not us” while featuring Bannon and seven current Breitbart staffers on your program is really not even trying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:28:15.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
