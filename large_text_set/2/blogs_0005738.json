While trying to grab some freshly popped popcorn she stepped on something hiding under her disaster of a room. \n“So, I was laying in my bed watching Netflix and I heard my microwave go off. I was cooking popcorn. I got so excited that I literally jumped off of my bed. I landed right on the charger,” Pechar said. 2 \nPecher quickly snapped a photo and tweeted it before her mom could take it out. The tweet currently has over 14,000 retweets. 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:15:17.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
