The short clips show the automatic machine spitting the president’s update out word for word on paper, lighting it aflame with a standard cigarette lighter, and finally, dropping it in an ashtray.\n“The goal with this robot was the same as with a lot of my robots: finding small, but not necessarily simple, ways of making life better,” Neevel told NBC New York .\nNeevel, feels that the stone cold robot performs a vital function for people who find the president’s updates stressful. “Burning each tweet allows people to acknowledge the tweet’s existence and perform a small ritual of dismissal of it,” he said.\nA day after its debut, the account has racked up roughly 15,700 followers with the stunt.\n. @RealDonaldTrump I burned your tweet. pic.twitter.com/X5WL9dMIGK \n— Burned Your Tweet (@burnedyourtweet) March 29, 2017 \n. @RealDonaldTrump I burned your tweet. pic.twitter.com/B0f1v0FkEb \n— Burned Your Tweet (@burnedyourtweet) March 28, 2017 \n. @RealDonaldTrump I burned your tweet. pic.twitter.com/Adn0qHUrKX \n— Burned Your Tweet (@burnedyourtweet) March 28, 2017 \n. @RealDonaldTrump I burned your tweet. pic.twitter.com/XESBxMncNv \n— Burned Your Tweet (@burnedyourtweet) March 28, 2017 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:11:03.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
