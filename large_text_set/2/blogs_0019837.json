He should listen to the people around him especially in the areas where he is weak,” he told NBC. \n“Trump cannot come to a meeting with Putin as a loser — he must sort out his domestic problems first.” \nWhile world leaders usually get briefed on a new president, those briefings generally don’t include psychological profiles. \nThe Kremlin has watched Trump’s behavior with alarm, according to Fedorov and Sergei Markov, a former Russian lawmaker who remains well-connected with Putin’s government. \nRussia worries that Trump won’t be able to follow through on his pledge to forge a stronger bond with Russia because of political opposition at home. \nTeam Trump has come under scrutiny over what some critics say is a too-rosy relationship with Russia. \nHe fired national security adviser Mike Flynn after Flynn talked with Russia’s ambassador about sanctions imposed in December by President Obama over Russian meddling in the US election. \nRussia “is now a kind of banana skin for Trump — that’s why we should avoid any kind of step that could damage Trump,” Fedorov said. \nHe added that Trump’s “constant battle with the mass media” — whom he has called “the enemy of the American people” — was “worrying us.” \nAnd a former prime minister under Putin told the network the Kremlin was not amused by Trump’s foibles during the first month of his presidency. \n“Absolutely not — not laughing,” Mikhail Kasyanov said. “The situation is very serious and the whole of [Putin’s] team, they are nervous.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:33:48.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
