Only five years ago Ranger was playing in Europe for Newcastle against Bordeaux (Photo: Getty) \nRequesting a pre-sentence report for Ranger, Angus Bunyan, defending, told the court: \"He is 25 years old and although he has some previous convictions, the only serious one was 10 years ago or more.\" \nAddressing Morgan and Duncan, Judge Peter Ader warned them about the consequences of not appearing in court for the trial at Wood Green Crown Court. \nHe said: \"(It is a) bit like the other team do not turn up for the match. They are going to lose. Do you follow? \n\"It is not a threat, I'm just telling you how it is.\" \nHe later asked them if they could remember the provisional date for their trial. The court heard that Nile Ranger has \"some previous convictions\" (Photo: Andy Commins) \nWhen they did not respond, he said: \"It may be the most important thing in your lives. It could be the difference between going to prison or being free.\" \nMorgan replied: \"April 24?\" \nJudge Ader said: \"Yes, well done.\" \nRanger will be sentenced after the trial. \nConspiracy to defraud can be heard only at the Crown Court. It is an offence at Common Law which means it is an offence created by previous decided cases. \nIt is punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine or both, although sentences of the maximum length are quite rare, and are usually only given in the most serious cases.
