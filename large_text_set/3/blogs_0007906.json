He creates penalties, he’s aggressive without the ball, presses and many other things. \n“It is the same case as Leroy. He’s a guy who still needs to improve. I would not like him to believe or think that it’s already done, that he’s good enough. \n“He can be better — especially in the simple things. Still he makes mistakes in the simple and easy things. When he improves that, wow! \n“You have to start with the simple things and then work on dribbling the ball, scoring goals, these kind of things. But he has the talent.” \nSterling and Sane are similar in age and the England star encouraged the German during his difficult start to his City career before he netted his first goal against Arsenal in December.

From the moment he was involved, on and off the pitch, the English players, like Raz and John Stones, helped him a lot. \n“The quality was there in the beginning. He’s playing good, but also we’re showing him a lot of clips - how many not good things he is doing and what he can improve. You cannot expect at 20 or 21 everyone is done. He has a lot of time to be a better player - a lot.” \nSane and Sterling have become a real double act in the dressing room too, even having the temerity to tease 34-year-old midfielder Yaya Toure by calling him \"Uncle\".

That’s a most precious and beautiful thing. The team spirit is better than ever since I’ve been here. That’s what I like the most.” poll loading Where will Manchester City finish this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T00:48:44.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
