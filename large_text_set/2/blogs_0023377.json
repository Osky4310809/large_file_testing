I can’t share the reasons why some of those didn’t come to fruition. It’s not an issue with the club, with the value or anything like that. It’s just, sometimes these things don’t happen for one reason or another. No hard feelings. You move on ’til you get the right partner.”\nCaption Orlando City unveils new home jerseys Orlando City unveiled new home jerseys, adopting a new look for its first season playing in a new stadium.\nOrlando City unveiled new home jerseys, adopting a new look for its first season playing in a new stadium.\nCaption Orlando City unveils new home jerseys Orlando City unveiled new home jerseys, adopting a new look for its first season playing in a new stadium.\nOrlando City unveiled new home jerseys, adopting a new look for its first season playing in a new stadium.\nCaption Orlando City players say Montverde Academy provides competitive scrimmage Orlando City forward Hadji Barry and midfielder Richie Laryea talk about the talent of Montverde Academy soccer players after facing the private area boarding and high school in a training scrimmage Saturday.\nOrlando City forward Hadji Barry and midfielder Richie Laryea talk about the talent of Montverde Academy soccer players after facing the private area boarding and high school in a training scrimmage Saturday.\nCaption Jason Kreis pleased with Orlando City's scrimmage vs Philadelphia Orlando City coach Jason Kreis said he saw some progress during the team's preseason scrimmage against the Philadelphia Union, which the Lions won 3-2.\nOrlando City coach Jason Kreis said he saw some progress during the team's preseason scrimmage against the Philadelphia Union, which the Lions won 3-2.\nCaption Orlando City goalkeeper coach Tim Mulqueen adjusting well to new job Orlando City goalkeeper coach Tim Mulqueen, who was hired in January to replace Stewart Kerr, says he is enjoying his new job and fits in well with the rest of the coaching staff.\nOrlando City goalkeeper coach Tim Mulqueen, who was hired in January to replace Stewart Kerr, says he is enjoying his new job and fits in well with the rest of the coaching staff.\nCaption Brek Shea ready and eager to prove himself with Orlando City in 2017 Orlando City midfielder Brek Shea says he feels better than he has in a long time a team the start of the 2017 MLS season.

He is ready to put last year's shortcomings behind him.\nParker said he cannot reveal which organizations are in the mix due to non-disclosure agreements, but they include local, national and global companies. He did not have a timeline for when the naming rights may be finalized. \n“The timeline remains the same: whenever it’s right,” Parker said. “These are long-term partnerships, minimum 10-15 years. Could be done tomorrow, could be done in a few weeks. This is not something we’re going to rush into.\n“We continue to be in discussion with people and on the phone every day with brands looking at us...value is there for right partner.”\nThe perfect partner for the club is a company that wants to invest in the community, has a vision for downtown Orlando, recognizes the growing soccer fan base and wants to support growth of the sport in the United States, according to Parker. \nThe eventual partner’s name will grace five areas in the new stadium, based on master signage plans submitted to the city, including the upper left corner of a 1,935-square-foot image of the Lions’ logo painted on architectural metal panels.\n\"For us, it’s about finding the right strategic partner for the next 10-15 years,” he said. “And we’re willing to put the time and work into doing that.”\nardelgallo@orlandosentinel.com \nCopyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Orlando City Lions", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:43:03.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
