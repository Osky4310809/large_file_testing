The suit is still pending against a local blogger who wrote a similar story.\nMrs. Trump also sued the Daily Mail newspaper, in U.K., over a version of the article which ran in print.

The Aug. 19, 2016 article , “Naked photoshoots, and troubling questions about visas that won’t go away: The VERY racy past of Donald Trump’s Slovenian wife” was read by millions of people, the Manhattan suit says.\nThe article was retracted.\nIt claimed that the future First Lady masqueraded as a model in New York in the 1990s, when she really worked for an escort agency that catered to wealthy men.\nThe story said the women carried two “composite cards”– one with measurements and agency details and another that “stated whether they prefer the older men and described their abilities in the bedroom.”\nThe claims are “completely false” and Mrs. Trump never worked in the “sex business,” the suit says.\n“As a result of defendant’s publication of defamatory statements about plaintiff, plaintiff’s brand has lost significant value, and major business opportunities that were otherwise available to her have been lost and/or significantly impacted,” the suit says.\nShe is represented by Charles Harder, the same attorney who won Hulk Hogan a $140 million verdict against Gawker in a Florida case financed by billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:29:37.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
