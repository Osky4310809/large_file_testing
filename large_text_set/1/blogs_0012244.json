When a dog is frightened or feels threatened he can become defensive or aggressive. This can happen in an instant and you might not have time to retreat. \n\"Do not put your face close to the dog and definitely do not try to hug or kiss him. Dogs do not understand this type of affection and a strange dog might perceive it as a threat.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T06:08:29.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
