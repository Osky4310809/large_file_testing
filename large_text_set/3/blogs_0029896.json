Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA three-year-old boy died after drowning in a bubbling jacuzzi at a hotel kids club, an inquest heard. \nThe little boy drowned as people walked close by, and was said to be invisible in the churning water for a number of minutes. \nA grandfather eventually spotted the boy floating, who appeared at first to be swimming, and raised the alarm. \nCCTV footage revealed the final movements of Ronan Kennedy, aged three years and ten months, from Templederry in Co Tipperary at the Quality Hotel in Youghal, Co Cork. \nThe footage showed the child exit the changing room and walk straight to the jacuzzi, Dublin Coroner's Court heard. \nThe child's parents, Bridget and John Kennedy, called on the government to introduce regulations for swimming pools immediately, the Irish Mirror reports. \nThe inquest heard that pools in Ireland are currently unregulated with regard to safety. \nIn a statement released after the inquest, the Kennedy family said: \"Ronan was a magical little boy. \n\"He loved to play outside, go farming and he adored his food. \n\"He was full of life, love and was extremely affectionate. \n\"This cannot happen to any other child. \n\"We ask that proper protocols be put in place regarding child safety within swimming pools,\" Read More \nGarda James Heffernan of Youghal Garda Station reviewed CCTV footage taken at the hotel pool on July 13 2015. The Quality Hotel, Redbarn, Youghal, Co Cork (Photo: Google Streetview) \nHe said Ronan walked out of the changing room directly to the water's edge. \nGda Heffernan said: \"He walked straight ahead from the door to the lip of the jacuzzi. \n\"He stepped into the seat of the jacuzzi and then he stepped directly into the middle of the jacuzzi. \n\"Unfortunately he is not visible for a number of minutes until he drifts out into the pool where he is found.\" \nKids club staff were placing armbands on children next to the pool near the reception area at the time, the court heard. \n\"Persons were walking very close and he is just not visible unfortunately,\" Gda Heffernan said. \nLiam Moloney was at the pool with his son and grandson when he found the child floating underwater. \n\"I saw this little lad, I thought he was swimming underwater at first,\" he told. \nHe noticed the child was not moving. \"I touched his head and lifted him out of the pool,\" Mr Moloney, who raised the alarm, added. \nThe inquest heard from Irish Water Safety (IWS) CEO John Leech who said there are no formal regulations for swimming pools, either public or private, in Ireland. \nThe pool at the Quality Hotel is privately owned by the hotel. \nMr Leech said pools are currently self-regulated, that there is no official register of swimming pools in Ireland and there is no obligation to follow IWS guidelines. \nHe recommended that an inspectorate be established to formulate and implement regulation in relation to safety in order to minimise future drownings. \nMr Leech said IWS guidelines for children of Ronan's age recommend a staff ratio of one to four. \nA day after arriving at the hotel for a short break, the Kennedy family rushed to Cork University Hospital and later to Temple Street Children's Hospital in Dublin, where Ronan was pronounced dead the following day. \nThe cause of death was hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to drowning according to Pathologist Dr Deirdre Devanney. \nThe verdict was death by drowning.
