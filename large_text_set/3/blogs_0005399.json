We know that. He pays as little in taxes as he can. We know that. \nThe American people made it clear they don’t care about Trump’s taxes. Time to move on guys. \nThis is just another sign that the left is desperate. \nSince the inauguration, they haven’t fought back with ideas or better policies. \nThey’ve lied, smeared, and basically encouraged lawlessness to get results. \nSad and intellectually bankrupt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T06:17:15.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
