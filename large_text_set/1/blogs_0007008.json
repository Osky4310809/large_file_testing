Kansas won 90 to 88.

Svi coast to coast for the win! pic.twitter.com/ItwAX60l3f — Rob Dauster (@RobDauster) January 4, 2017 \nIf you're wondering how the heck that wasn't called when the play was reviewed, ESPN's Andy Katz has the answers. This will probably only make Wildcats fans more furious, but here's what Katz's \"officiating source\" within the Big 12 says : \nSaid the source, \"That is a judgment call that in fast motion it is very hard to tell if he ended dribble with a foot on floor and went step step or if both feet were in air when ended dribble so it is legal to go step step. Tough play to call either way.\" \nAdditionally, Katz added: They were looking at the clock to make sure he got the shot off on time. They don't go to the monitor for judgment calls. https://t.co/6EblO9amwz — Andy Katz (@ESPNAndyKatz) January 4, 2017 \nSo yep, Kansas got away with that one. Here is where Svi Mykhailiuk started his final dribble. He's in the backcourt. Only 50 feet away from the bucket. pic.twitter.com/ylItDdZWsN — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) January 4, 2017 \nKansas State loses, while Kansas makes the SportsCenter Top 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:22:46.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
