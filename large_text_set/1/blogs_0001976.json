It's a better story than any that Doyle (Or Paris. Or Rory, for that matter.) ever wrote for the Yale Daily News on Gilmore Girls .Danny Strong, the actor who played Doyle on both the original Gilmore Girls and Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life , is now engaged to fellow actor Caitlin Mehner. He shared the good news, and the good story, on Instagram. He posted a picture of Mehner and her new engagement ring.

She gave him her number, but it was a digit short. He tracked her down, anyway, and the rest is now history. \"Last night I got up the nerve to ask her to marry me and she said yes!\" the Empire co-creator (along with Lee Daniels) and former Buffy star wrote.The happy couple is vacationing and celebrating in Hawaii. Mehner posted a photo with an even clearer shot of her new ring and an even better caption: \"Can I still be team Paris and Doyle forever?\" A photo posted by Caitlin Mehner (@mehns) on Dec 30, 2016 at 3:34pm PST Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:21:05.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
