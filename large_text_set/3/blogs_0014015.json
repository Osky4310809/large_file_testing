Portuguese paper A Bola say Ronaldo has put in a good word with Bernabeu's hierachy. \nAt just 21-years-old, Silva still has a lot of developing to do but could be the perfect antidote to Real's ageing forward line. \nBut what other transfer stories are there in Wednesday's paper? Here's our round-up of the latest news and gossip...

Optimism has been high at Goodison that the 23-year-old Belgian would commit himself to a lucrative new five-year contract worth £140,000-a-week, keeping him from the champions-elect's clutches. But despite his agent Mino Raiola claiming in December and again last month to be “99.9999 per cent\" sure he'd sign, Lukaku is now understood to be unwilling to do so — unless a release clause of no more than £70million is included. \nMarseille teenager Maxime Lopez says Liverpool approached him last year, telling him he could be Philippe Coutinho's successor. \nAitor Karanka faces a make-or-break clash with Manchester United at the Riverside on Sunday. The Middlesbrough boss is fighting for his future after his side plunged deep into relegation trouble, and his tenure is likely to come under review during next week’s international break if his side flops again.

And the 28-year-old West Ham striker could be joined in the Three Lions squad for this month's double header against Germany and Lithuania by fellow Hammers forward Michail Antonio. The pair are in the frame because Southgate has been hit by a rash of injuries up front, with Harry Kane, skipper Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge all out. He could also call up 34-year-old Jermain Defoe. \nSlaven Bilic's future will be decided at the end of the season. Despite claims last week that a new deal was close for the popular West Ham boss, club chiefs will look at his performance in one of the annual reviews that follow every campaign. \nJose Mourinho and his Manchester United players were left raging at their club’s shambolic organisation at Heathrow Airport on Monday night. A jet chartered by United officials to fly the team and technical staff back to Manchester straight after their controversial FA Cup loss to Chelsea was still overseas upon their arrival at Heathrow. The squad nded up making a four-hour bus journey and didn't get back to Manchester until 4am — far from ideal when they face Rostov in the second leg of a Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday.
