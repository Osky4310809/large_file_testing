Steve Watkin fires in Wrexham's winner against Arsenal \nAnd on 4 January, 1992 things were going to plan when an Arsenal team including winger Paul Merson, Tony Adams and David Seaman took the lead through Alan Smith just before half-time. \nBut Mickey Thomas' stunning free-kick brought Wrexham level and two minutes later Watkin pounced on some slack defending to fire the winner past England goalkeeper Seaman. \n\"It's got to be the highlight of my career,\" said Watkin, now 45. \n\"I played lower leagues all my career and it can be tough at times and you get plenty of disappointments along the way, but playing in games like that makes it all worthwhile. \n\"Obviously Mickey's goal set us off. \n\"Up until then I don't think we'd looked like scoring so that was the catalyst if you like and a few minutes later I managed to get the winner which was great for me, obviously, being born in Wrexham as well.\" \nSteve Watkin is a guest on BBC Radio Wales Sport, 19:00 GMT on Wednesday, 4 January Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T13:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T09:45:43.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
