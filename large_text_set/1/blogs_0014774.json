A new report claims that the first such phone is scheduled to be launched in mid-2017 and will be priced between $200 and $300.\nSee also: Nougat arrives for Android One September 12, 2016 The story comes from The Information , citing unnamed sources. While the maker of the US-based Android One handset has yet to be revealed, the story claims that LG could be the first out of the gate. Google will offer regular software updates for the phone up to two years after it goes on sale, much like it does for its own Nexus and Pixel devices. The story adds that Google plans to fund a major ad campaign for this Android One phone when it launches. After it arrives Google will consider adding more Android One phones from other companies on a case-by-case basis.\nThe story says one of the reasons why Google wants to bring Android One to the US is to help promote the Android brand itself. Most consumers are more aware of Samsung’s Galaxy devices rather than Android itself, and Google wants to change that.\nGoogle first announced the Android One platform in 2014 , with the company’s idea of bringing affordable Android phones, with a stock version of the OS, to developing countries. The first such phones from third-party companies launched in Asia and Africa and later they were sold in parts of Europe and Japan. So far the sales results have been mixed, but it looks like Google is sticking with its plan and expanding into one of the biggest markets for phones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T04:28:51.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
