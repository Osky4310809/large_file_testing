People often use a word in place of one that sounds similar. \nThese malapropisms often have the unfortunate effect of making the speaker seem ignorant. \nRead below to see 11 examples of words and phrases that often come out incorrectly. 1. For all 'intents and purposes' — not for all 'intensive purposes' \nIf you say \"for all intensive purposes,\" you mean \"for all these very thorough purposes,\" which doesn't make any sense. \nOn the other hand, \"for all intents and purposes\" means \"for all the reasons I did this and all the outcomes.\" It's a much stronger cliche. 2. You've got another 'think' coming — not you've got another 'thing' coming \nThe phrase was originally, \"If that's what you think, you've got another think coming.\" We just dropped the first clause. Still, this may be a case where the misuse of the phrase now seems to be more popular that the original. Even former US President Barack Obama has used \"thing\" instead of \"think.\" 3. One 'and' the same — not one 'in' the same \n\"One in the same\" refers to one thing in a group of other things that look the same — meaningless. \"One and the same\" means that two things are alike. 4. 'Deep-seated' — not 'deep-seeded' \nThis phrase means something is firmly fixed in place, not that it is planted deeply, as the latter implies. 5. Case 'in' point — not case 'and' point \n\"Case in point\" means, \"Here's an example of this point I'm trying to make.\" The version with \"and\" makes them two different things, which isn't helpful to your argument at all. \nFor the record, the plural is \"cases in point.\" 6. Should/could/would 'have' — not should/could/would 'of' \nUsing \"of\" here is just wrong. You need to pair a verb with another verb. Otherwise, people will think \"of\" what? 11 grammatical mistakes that instantly reveal people's ignorance 7. Nip it in the 'bud' — not nip it in the 'butt' \nThis phrase should imply you cut a new bud (off a plant), not bit someone in the backside. 8. 'Wreak' havoc — not 'wreck' havoc \nTo \"wreck\" havoc means to destroy havoc, which is the exact opposite of this phrase's meaning. When you \"wreak havoc,\" you're spreading chaos, anarchy, and destruction everywhere, which is really fun. 9. I 'couldn't' care less — not I 'could' care less 11 grammatical mistakes that instantly reveal people's ignorance \nIf you \"could\" care less, you're admitting there are other, less important things in world, which takes away the sting of your comment. By saying you \"couldn't\" care less, that means nothing else exists on the planet that matters less you. Major burn. 10. Please 'proceed' — not please 'precede' \nTo proceed means to move forward, while to precede means to come before. 11. 'Supposedly' — not 'supposably' \n\"Supposably\" isn't even a word. It's a slight but important distinction. \nRead more from Business Insider UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:41:32.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
