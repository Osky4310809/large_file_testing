The Amazing Spider-Man #25 Marvel is just so happy to let you know they’re in control of the Spider-Man movies now. After debuting Tom Holland’s take on the MCU wall-crawler in this summer’s Captain America: Civil War , the studio is now puppeteering the corpse of Sony Weekend at Bernie’s -style to make a new standalone Spider-Man flick: Spider-Man Homecoming . Last night, we got our first look of what they’ve come up with. Check it out!\n \nCheck out the new poster, too!\n\nWow! Wise-cracks, web wings , 80s teen angst comedy, and a copious amount of Avengers references anchored by Tony Stark himself. If we must have a third live-action version of this character in only a decade, at least we’re getting some stuff we haven’t seen before. Meanwhile, the stuff we have seen before is stuff worth revisiting. Spider-Man straining to web the bridge and subway train together in a Christ pose were two of the best parts of Sam Raimi’s original Spider-Man movies. And since those movies are just about perfect, Homecoming is smart to crib from them for its boat disaster setpiece.\nBut wait, there’s more! The trailer above is the American version of the trailer. Last night Marvel also released an international trailer that’s fairly different. See for yourself!\nSo what’s changed? Well for one thing the tone has shifted slightly from “superhero-themed American high school romantic dramedy” to a more standard Marvel superhero film, presumably to cater to differing cultural tastes. The international trailer includes footage of Spider-Man’s Civil War footage, but the American version has Peter watching himself fighting Giant-Man on his laptop distracted in class. What’s more exciting is the extra footage of famous Batman Michael Keaton’s Vulture, a winged bad guy in a robot fur coat leading a crew of New York mooks armed with high-tech (Chitauri?) weaponry.\nAnd if you’re demanding even more moving pictures of Spider-Man, the tease for yesterday’s trailer has its own original footage. Tony Stark’s manservant Happy Hogan gifts Peter his web wing suit upgrade filmed in a first-person, GoPro-style. None of the other footage is presented this way, but perhaps sequences in the final film will be.\nSpider-Man Homecoming makes its brave attempt to be the third- or fourth-best Spider-Man movie July 7, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:19:16.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
