DeMerit’s latest effort includes the creation of “Rockit Logs,” audiophile speakers crafted from acoustic quality soft-tone woods for a luxury aesthetic.\nAs each Rockit Log has been retrieved from an entirely unique place, whether it be part of a fallen tree or pole yard, the creation of each log means that no two are exactly alike. Additionally, standing at around 12 inches in diameter, each log is made to be easily handled and entirely portable. Each speaker features exclusively customizability.\nProceeds from each log will be donated to Jay DeMerit’s Rise and Shine Foundation, to help kids dream big and find unique experiences and mentorship. Check out the Kickstarter page here .\nFor more from Kickstarter, check out the MOON Lunar Globe. \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T11:04:36.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
