(Barbara Haddock Taylor & Kenneth K. Lam, Baltimore Sun video) (Sarah Meehan) \nThe idea isn't new, but it's growing. It's a model that allows entrepreneurs to pull from different revenue streams and a wider customer base, rather than relying on one niche. \nAnnika Stensson, director of research communications for the National Restaurant Association, said it's part of an evolving trend of restaurants finding a foothold in nontraditional spaces and setting themselves apart from competitors, especially as they look to attract younger consumers looking for more than food. \n\"The restaurant industry is very competitive — always has been, always will be. So sort of adding that extra draw can always be a good idea,\" she said. \"Consumers are not just looking for a meal to fill their stomachs these days. They're also looking for an experience.\" \nHandlebar opened quietly the last week of December serving coffee and gradually ramped up its restaurant offerings before opening its bike shop Friday. \nThe cafe offers craft coffee and beer, wood-fired pizzas, burritos and other hearty fare with Latin American influences in an industrial space where guests park their bikes inside or outdoors while they eat. \n\"We're a restaurant, so we're supplementing the slow periods,\" said Streb, a world champion mountain biker. \"Bike season is definitely slow in the winter, so we're supplementing. They complement each other.\" \nThe thought was the same at Baby's on Fire. Owners Shirlé Hale-Koslowski and David Koslowski have journals dating 15 years with lists and sketches tracing the roots of their plans for the record store-cafe. It opened in June, combining the passions of the husband-wife duo. \nHis wife, Shirlé Hale-Koslowski, was a willing partner. She has run a personal-chef business, Four Corners Cuisine, for 15 years. ... ... (Suzanne Loudermilk) \nKoslowski, who spent 15 years in marketing and web design, was looking for a change of speed from the corporate world, and Hale-Koslowski, a personal chef, needed a commercial kitchen to grow her business. Both enjoyed listening to vinyl records and played in a band together. When they saw a void in Mount Vernon for a record store, Baby's on Fire was born. \n\"We've always wanted to combine the things that we love,\" Koslowski said. \"She's a chef, so we love really good food. We love coffee and drink and people and community and also music — we're both musicians.\" \nRents aren't getting any cheaper, so it makes sense that restaurants are looking to capitalize on their retail space by offering more than food, said Darren Tristano, president of Technomic Inc., a Chicago research and consulting firm that tracks the food industry. \nThe trend applies in reverse, too. He's seen banks serving coffee, for example. \n\"If you think about Cracker Barrel, 20 percent of their sales are coming out of the front of the store,\" Tristano said. \"It's becoming more and more common, but what we're starting to see is a lot of non-restaurants from a retail environment offering food items.\" \nKoslowski said he was surprised from the start how many records the shop was selling. The food, coffee and vinyls each account for about a third of the sales. Weekends and holidays see heavier record sales, while the cafe is filled with more diners during the week. \nNamed for a Brian Eno song, the cafe carries 2,500 to 3,000 records — mostly used, and some new. The cafe serves Stumptown Coffee alongside casual breakfast and lunch fare such as mac and cheese, paninis, soups, pastries and bagels. \nThe records are set in central bins, with two-top tables lining the walls. \nBird in Hand, the bookstore-cafe collaboration from Spike Gjerde and Ivy Bookstore owners Ann and Ed Berlin, will open to the public Nov. 7. \nThe cafe is located at 11 E. 33rd St. in the Nine East 33rd building, the new student housing development at St. Paul and 33rd streets. \nThe Bird in Hand is... \nBird in Hand, the bookstore-cafe collaboration from Spike Gjerde and Ivy Bookstore owners Ann and Ed Berlin, will open to the public Nov. 7. \nThe cafe is located at 11 E. 33rd St. in the Nine East 33rd building, the new student housing development at St. Paul and 33rd streets. \nThe Bird in Hand is... (Sarah Meehan) \nAt Bird in Hand, it's the opposite set-up. About 2,500 books line the walls, and tables and couches sit between them, immersing customers who are sipping coffee and studying. \n\"We never want it to feel separate,\" said Lauren Pavin, Bird in Hand's general manager. \"So even sitting here in the cafe, the colors of the books mix with all the colors of the tiles and it kind of just feels all as one. You don't feel like this is a separate entity.\" \nThe concepts that merged to inspire Bird in Hand — Artifact Coffee and the Ivy Bookshop — exist on their own successfully. But Bird in Hand attracts different clientele, who have in turn shaped the menu and retail offerings. \nPavin is also general manager at Artifact, where she sees more customers ordering basic drip brews and pour-over coffees. At Bird in Hand, the customers skew younger — including many students — and they tend to order more specialty drinks. \n\"It's a learning process, from the second you come up with the idea, until you open those doors, until its first two months that you're running,\" Pavin said. \"You're adapting to your environment.\" \nThe shop is also tweaking its book selection to meet customers' needs: adding more textbooks, for example. And in a couple weeks, the shop will add a section of coffee and cocktail books alongside cookbooks handpicked by chef Spike Gjerde , one of the shop's proprietors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:26:43.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
