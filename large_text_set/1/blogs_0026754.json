The filmmaker and writer has been quite successful in his partnerships with the Oprah Winfrey Network, and they have yet another series in the works. <img src=\"http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tyler-Perry-shows.jpeg\" alt=\"Tyler Perry shows\" width=\"1068\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784186\" /> <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2017/01/own-the-paynes-house-of-payne-spinoff-tyler-perry-more-the-haves-and-have-nots-if-loving-you-is-wrong-love-thy-neighbor-cnaceled-for-better-or-worse-1201897435/\" target=\"_blank\">According to <em>Deadline</em></a>, the network announced a 38-episode order of a new comedy series called <em>The Paynes</em>, which is a spinoff of his TBS comedy <em>House of Payne</em>, which ended in 2012. The series, which as always is directed, written and produced by Perry, will reunite us with Curtis (LaVan Davis) and Ella Payne (Cassi Davis). The pair are trying to enjoy retirement in Florida, but find themselves caught up in a bad real estate deal. Production for the series has already begun, and it will premiere in 2018 on OWN. As for the network's other hits, 44 additional episodes of the hit drama series <em>The Haves and the Have Nots</em> were ordered, as well as 18 new episodes of <em>If Love You Is Wrong. </em> However, to make room for <em>The Paynes </em>and the added episodes of the aforementioned dramas<em>, </em>OWN also announced that they are ending both <em>Love Thy Neighbor </em>and <em>For Better or Worse</em>. The two comedies will be moved to Saturday nights and will go into their final seasons. It will be the fourth season for <em>Love Thy Neighbor</em>, which will premiere on March 4 with back-to-back episodes at 9 p.m. The final season will have 22 episodes. For<em> Better or Worse </em>will premiere with its sixth season this summer, June 10, at 9 p.m. The final season will have 20 episodes. In a statement, Erik Logan, president of OWN said that \"Tyler has been an incredible collaborator, a great partner and has an unprecedented track record of success with his hit scripted series. Tyler’s shows are must see TV for his loyal audience and we are excited to offer up a brand-new comedy and more episodes of their favorite Tyler dramas on OWN. We also would like to thank the entire casts of both ‘Love Thy Neighbor’ and ‘For Better or Worse’ who have given us loads of laughs over the years. Both series have had great runs and we appreciate everyone’s hard work and dedication.\" <em>Love Thy Neighbor </em>is a half-hour sitcom about Love Train Diner owner Hattie Mae Love and both the funny highs as well as the lows faced by the matriarch, her family and friends. As for <em>For Better or Worse</em>, that is, of course, the show starring Tasha Smith and Michael Jai White. It's about three couples, led by Marcus and Angela, who are handling the different stages of marriage they're in, and the issues that come with them. The series initially premiered on TBS in 2011, and, ironically, was announced when that channel announced the end of <em>House of Payne</em>.
