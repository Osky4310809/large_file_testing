He walks around dancing all day, just being goofy. 3. Family Is Boyer’s Priority (Getty) \nBoyer and Bryan have two sons together – Thomas Boyer Bryan and Tatum Christopher Bryan. Boyer told Country Weekly : \nWith three boys in my house, I’m constantly on the go and cleaning … Luke being the messiest one. I have no aspirations for anything else in the industry. My main focus are my kids and seeing Luke as much as possible. Also, I really have no talent anyway. \nBoyer is a hard-working mother and her husband does not fail to notice all her efforts, telling Taste of Country : \nCaroline busts her butt to be the perfect wife, lets me have this career and lets me shake my ass on stage every night. 4.

If we have a beef, we always talk it out instead of letting it snowball … We have coffee in the morning, just Caroline and me. It’s my favorite time of the day; anytime we can have 30 minutes to talk, it’s just great … We do little nights out together. One Valentine’s Day, we got each other’s initials tattooed on our ring fingers … Every night before bed, I rub my wife’s feet. She says they’re the best foot rubs on Earth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:32:53.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
