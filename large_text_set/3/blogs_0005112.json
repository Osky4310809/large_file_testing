But police in Ibadan, who discovered that the kidnappers were heading to Lagos with the victim’s Toyota Highlander, communicated with the Lagos Command for assistance. \nAccording to the RRS Commander, Assistant Commissioner Tunji Disu, RRS officials, on receiving the radio signal, tracked the vehicle to Ikeja, from where the alleged suspects further moved the vehicle to a compound somewhere around Abule Egba, Lagos. The suspects \nThe officers later arrested a suspect and recovered the Toyota Highlander, number plates LND 954 EE. \nDisu stated that the first suspect assisted the police in the arrest of another suspect, who was later apprehended in Ikeja, while another suspect simply identified as Theophilus, is still at large. \nAccording to one of the suspects, Funsho, a fashion designer around Felele area of Ibadan, where it was believed the kidnapping took place, “Theophilus handed over the car to me in Ibadan and told me to look for a buyer. \n“I brought the car to Lagos because I know that I will easily get a buyer for it. The instruction from Theophilus was that I should sell the Highlander at N800,000. \n“I got a buyer in Ondo State. He has bought a car from me before— a fairly clean Toyota Corolla. He bought it for N550,000. I took the car to him on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, where he paid me before moving the car away. \n“Charles is my friend of over five years. We met at a church in Ogba, where I was a chorister. I gave him the car to keep in a warehouse, while I look for a buyer. He took the car from me at Ikeja to his house in Abule Egba. \nAn RRS source said: “The case has been taken up by Oyo State Anti-kidnapping team for further investigations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T06:53:04.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
