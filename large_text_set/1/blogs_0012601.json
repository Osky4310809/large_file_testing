The show beat out Black-ish and Veep , among others, to win Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, while Glover took home the award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy. \nDuring his acceptance speech at this past Sunday’s awards ceremony, Gambino gave a gracious thank you to Migos for nothing more than giving the world “Bad and Boujee,” which is currently #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . \nAlthough the next installment of Atlanta won’t air until 2018, Migos’ Quavo is already eyeing a role in the show’s second season: “ I hope [Childish Gambino] hit my phone, I hope we can do season two,” the ATL rapper said during a recent interview with The Progress Report.
