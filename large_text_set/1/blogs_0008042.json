While Edward is fighting Victoria, Seth hurls Riley's dismembered arm at her, knocking her out of the air as she lunges for Bella and giving Edward the chance to finish her. Seth then seizes Riley from behind and drags him behind a patch of trees where he tears him apart (in the film, he drags Riley behind a snow-covered hill). \nAfter the battle, Seth develops a genuine friendship with Edward and returns to La Push as a hero. In the film, he is last seen waiting outside of Jake's house while Jake is given much-needed medical treatment.

Bella calls him regularly for updates on Jacob, who has fled the reservation after discovering that Edward and Bella are engaged and refuses to transform back into his human form, instead living in the wilderness in Canada as a wolf. Bella also genuinely enjoys talking to Seth, though doesn't dare to talk to Leah for whom \"the phrase 'bite my head off' was not entirely a figure of speech\". \nSeth attends Bella and Edward's wedding with his mother and Billy Black , and tells Edward that \"It's good to see things work out for you, man. I'm happy for you\".

He discovers that she is in reality pregnant, and returns to the pack.

Jared comes to try and convince the renegade pack to return to La Push , claiming that Sue feels betrayed by her children's abandonment, so soon after their father's death. Though it pains Seth, he refuses, and stays loyal to Jacob and the Cullens'. \nIn Breaking Dawn - Part 1 , Seth first appears at the wedding, then on the beach sitting alongside Jacob, Leah, and Embry . He wonders whether Jacob would be able to kill Bella if she becomes a vampire. He is present during the pack's meeting to discuss killing an unborn Renesmee. He, along with Jacob, are forced to bow down to Sam after they protest about killing Bella.

Physical appearance Edit Seth's wolf form. \nAs a human, Bella describes Seth as having a \"tall, gangly build\", with a youthful face and a \"huge, happy grin\" with brown eyes and around 6 feet tall. His skin is russet colored and his hair is black, worn short like the other boys in the pack. Bella notes that he reminds her of a younger Jacob. Wolf form \nAs a wolf, Seth remains tall and gangly, and has sandy colored fur and oversized paws. In the movies, his build takes on the appearance of a Mexican wolf , smaller and rangier than those of the older shapeshifters. Personality and traits Edit \nSeth is slightly immature and childish, but cheerful, optimistic and exceptionally kind, much like Angela Weber . He idolizes both Jacob and Edward. Edward comments that he has one of the purest, kindest, sincerest minds he'd ever heard. He can also be depicted as forceful and independent when he wants to do something important. \nAlthough he repels vampires' smell just like all the other shapeshifters, he doesn't mind it, and even praises Edward on his cooking abilities. He is also the first of his pack to truly like the Cullens', due to their diet on animal blood, which allows him to think of them as people rather than actual vampires. \nHe also has an energetic and self-assured attitude, which is shown when he departs from Sam's pack to join Jacob. Whenever Jacob gives him an order, he would obey without question or hesitation. He sees his powers as a gift instead of a curse, and enjoys them more than most of his pack members. \nSeth has a sharp mind and is quick at thinking as he was the first to oppose the assault towards the Cullens because the pack refused to consult with the Elders (which they were supposed to do and initially aborted the mission due to lack of offensive force) and he was the first to recognize that Jacob isn't thinking properly when he wanted to attack the Cullens after Bella's return from Brazil due to the treaty without proper investigation. Wolf abilities Edit Seth attacking Riley. \nSeth is noted to have the best hearing among his pack mates. He demonstrates this skill in Breaking Dawn when he listens to decipher the number of wolves coming their way. \nAlthough physically smaller than most wolves in his pack, he can still take down a lone vampire by himself. For instance, when he fights Riley Biers in Eclipse without help. However, his pack members and sister still view him more as a kid who needs protection. \nAccording to The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide , Seth and his sister Leah are the only pack members who have inherited shape-shifter genes from all three families. Relationships \nSeth Clearwater is the son of Sue and Harry Clearwater , the younger brother of Leah Clearwater , and second cousin of Emily Young .
