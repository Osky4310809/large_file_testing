The following is a transcript of the above video: \nLoren Landow of Landow Performance: “I think for the guys it’s to get a dress rehearsal. I think it’s one thing to practice day-in and day-out, all these drills, all these tests, but at the end of the day, the combine, the pro day, it’s more like a track and field event. And it’s different when you have 10 other guys lining up with you on the football field to maybe have a technical mistake or have a flaw, but when it’s just you and you’re being evaluated based on hundredths of seconds, one there has to be a high amount of scrutiny on what’s being done, and two, you have to have a lot of good eyes on you to help you kind of find out what those flaws are. \nLandow: “For me it was a dress rehearsal for these guys to get a little bit of nerves having you guys here and just competing and putting it on the line with the peers who they’ve been training with. That’s the biggest thing we wanted, because at pro day they have a three-hour window to shine.” \nAlex Kelley, Colorado Buffaloes center: “We’re football players and we take a lot of reps and stuff to perfect it and that’s kind of what Loren is doing here. We practiced these drills every day and this is the first day we’ve really put all the drills together to see how we’ve performed.” \nLandow: “It’s all new to them, really, right? They’ve been playing football for the last eight years at least, and now this whole combine thing, it’s a different animal. So there’s a lot of newness that’s being learned. But at the same time all the guys are trusting the process and they know the process will deliver the outcomes.” \nKevin Davis, Colorado State Rams linebacker: “That’s something that we do every single day in every workout that we do is push each other. There’s competition, things like that. There’s a real good environment.” Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T03:21:14.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
