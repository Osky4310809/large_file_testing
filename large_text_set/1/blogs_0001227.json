All these would change with the effect of the ban. \n“The Federal Government generates enough revenue on vehicle importation as the Seme Customs Area Command alone generates N600 million monthly on vehicle duties. \n“However, all that will change with the ban placed on the border importation of vehicles. The government should consider all these factors, including the fact that the country is going through recession and this policy is going to worsen the hardship on Nigerians.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:37:44.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
