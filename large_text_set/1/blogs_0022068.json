Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 Dakota Johnson's Road From Hollywood Offspring to Fifty Shades of Fabulous \nMuch like Drew Barrymore , Kate Hudson , and Jane Fonda before her, Dakota Johnson comes from an impressive (and talented) Hollywood lineage . Her grandparents are Tippi Hedren, Hitchcock muse and star of The Birds , and Peter Griffith, a Broadway actor. Her parents, of course, are actors Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and her former stepfather is Antonio Banderas . Dakota made her big-screen debut alongside her mother in 1999's Crazy in Alabama , but her big break came when she was cast as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele in the movie adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey (she's currently filming the second film adaptation of the series with Jamie Dornan ). She's also starred in Black Mass and the romantic comedy How to Be Single with Leslie Mann and Rebel Wilson . \nAside from showing off her acting chops, Dakota has also blossomed into a breakout style star and made us laugh with her off-the-cuff remarks and appearances on talk shows and in award ceremonies . As we gear up for the release of Fifty Shades Darker , we're taking a look back at Dakota's evolution from Hollywood offspring to standalone starlet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:17:19.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
