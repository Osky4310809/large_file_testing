Share on Facebook Share   \nFormer National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has offered to testify to the FBI about President Donald Trump’s ties with Russia in exchange for immunity. \nFlynn has informed both the FBI and members of Congress investigating the relationship between Russia and the president that “he is willing to be interviewed in exchange for a grant of immunity from prosecution, according to officials with knowledge of the matter,” The Wall Street Journal reported. \nThe president responded with a tweet, repeating his claims that the three ongoing investigations are no more than “witch hunts.”   Trump Targets The Freedom Caucus: ‘We Must Fight Them’ \n“Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss),” Trump tweeted, “by media & Dems, of historic proportion!” Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017 \nThe news broke on Thursday night when Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, issued a statement saying that his client was ready to talk.   \n“General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” stated Kelner in the statement. \nFlynn resigned last month from his post as National Security Advisor after news surfaced that he had spoken over the phone with Russian officials, discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions. \nFlynn’s attorney cited the political climate as a reason to seek assurance that his client could speak freely without legal consequences. \n“No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch-hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution,” the statement continued.
