King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 11 Mark Tremonti recently shared his take on how guitar solos should be tackled, stressing the importance of solo pieces standing out on their own.He tells Total Guitar : \"I always try to have a vocal approach when if you took every solo out of its song and played it by itself, it would stand alone as a composition.\"I love it when you can reintroduce the vocal melodies in parts of the solos and build off of that here and there. I love hitting the chord changes and for there to be a beginning, middle and end to every solo just like there is in every song.\"I don't like it to be just a collection of repetitive riffs that are there for the sake of being there.\"The guitarist added: \"I like to have as much emotion as possible. And when I can't find that emotion in the solo, a lot of times I'll say, 'Hey Myles how do you feel about this solo section? Do you want to do it?' And he'll jump right on it. Like the ' Crows on a Wire ' solo [off the latest Alter Bridge album ' The Last Hero '], I wasn't feeling that at all. And he did a great job.\"Mark further noted: \"It will probably take me on average 3 days to put together a solo. But that's with the kids going to bed at 9 o'clock and me up until 4 in the morning every day. That's with me playing over it maybe 150 times, recording it every time and seeing if thereâ€™s a piece I want to make work.\"The hardest part for me is how does it begin. Once I have that beginning down it flows much easier for me because then when I improvise over it I'll start the same way then see where it takes me.\"If I come up with something cool then I've got the first couple of parts. A lot of times I'll have the beginning and the ending first, or the beginning and where it repeats the chord progression now. Then I've got to fill in the other parts. In the studio sometimes I'll fall off the rails into something else that's cooler and improvised that works. Because sometimes improvised solos have a certain magic that you can't repeat.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:35:38.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
