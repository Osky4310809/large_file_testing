Kennedy Jr. , who falsely claims there’s a link between vaccines and autism. He invited Kennedy to “chair a commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity,” a position he apparently accepted . \nThe reaction among the scientific community — the people who understand the danger this appointment would pose to public health — are appalled by the decision. \nBy the way, Kennedy’s beliefs are so unscientific that Salon pulled one of his pieces from their site. When you can’t meet Salon ‘s editorial standards, you know there’s a problem. \n(Top screenshot via YouTube )", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:48:05.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
