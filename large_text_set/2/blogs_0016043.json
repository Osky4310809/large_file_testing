I want it. I need it.\" FlotSamX also asked: \"At what point does the Overwatch team decides that a character 'needs work', i.e. buffs/nerfs/adjustments?\"And _ComixInk queried: \"What was your inspiration for the Overwatch universe?\" \nFrom the editors' batch of inquiries, questions included: D.Va has undergone a lot of changes—are you happy with her?
