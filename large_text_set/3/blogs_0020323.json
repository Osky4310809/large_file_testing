By Jeffrey Matulef Published 21/03/2017 \nDark Souls 3 is getting a new patch on 24th March that will add an improved framerate for PS4 Pro users. \nThis 1.11 update will also add two new PvP arenas for the game's Undead Match modes. These include Dragon Ruins and Grand Roof. \nThe patch also adds the ability to stay on the same team as your friends when playing in PvP. Following the update, you can have one password for friends joining one team, then another for those joining another team. Prior to this patch, players could only go to the same match as their friends, but had no say in assigning teams. \nYou'll get the new PvP maps so long as you have either DLC add-on.
