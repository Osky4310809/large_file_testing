They are vacuumed on a 21 day rotation during a longer clean, when train poles and floors also get a going over.\nThe Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines: \nSeats are vacuumed every night. Floors are given a general mopping every night and get a proper polish every 17 to 23 days.\nLitter will be removed every night on all lines.\n\nFloors across the network are swept every night, and are mopped every two to three days.\nMan hammered nail into dog's skull before burying it alive You can put down your hand sanitisers for now as poles on the network are spot cleaned nightly and are wiped down every two to three days.\nWhile it’s not advisable to hang off the outside of a train James Bond style, those who do will be pleased to know that train exteriors are cleaned every three days, provided it isn’t too cold outside.
