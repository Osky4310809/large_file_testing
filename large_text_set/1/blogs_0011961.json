Individually pick up everything that you own. Hold it. Look at it. Ask yourself: Does this thing bring me joy? \nThinking happy thoughts? Keeper. Lukewarm? Toss. Opt for Multipurpose Products \nStay away from bulky furniture, which instantly cramps a room—they also take up more space then they offer. In a small area, you have to get creative. Get an ottoman that doubles as storage ($53, amazon.com ) , a dresser that doubles as an entertainment center ($100, ikea.com ) , and a desk that doubles as a coffee table ($180, amazon.com ) . \nIf your living room doubles as an eating space, invest in a kitchen cart that stores two stools, gives you extra counter space, and unfolds into a table ($120, amazon.com ) . \nNeed help organizing your closet, too? Here’s the smartest way to do it . Look Under Your Bed \nThe area under your bed might be the most underutilized spaces in a home. Maximizing it can have a huge impact on the clutter—we like it best for storing out-of-season clothes and luggage. \nInvest in two main organization tools here: vacuum-sealed storage bags and rolling storage containers. Get a jumbo pack of bags to use for clothes, sheets, and towels ($21, amazon.com ) . One you put your clothes in the bags, seal them up, and toss them in the rolling storage containers. The wheels are a small but significant detail—it makes it so much easier to grab things like those extra sheets and towels when guests come by. Make the Most of Your Walls \nA big piece of art makes a room appear much larger than a bunch of smaller pieces; it brings focus to the wall without cluttering it. You can also be functional here—install wall mounts to put your bike on display when you’re not riding. \nBe conscious of your TV, too. A big, bulky TV is distracting, and exposed wires make a room instantly cluttered. Try keeping it in an armoire, and concealing the wires. (That TV might be hurting your sperm. Here’s why .) Think About The Lighting \nLight colors open up a space, while dark colors close it. Lighter walls and furniture will reflect natural, opening up the area—that’s especially important around the floor and ceiling. \nWindows can especially create the illusion of space. During the day, make sure you’re getting as much natural light as you can. At night, stay away from harsh overhead lighting. Softer lights—like table and standing lamps—will give the small space a cozy look.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:06:15.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
