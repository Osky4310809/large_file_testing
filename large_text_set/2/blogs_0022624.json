While the drone--apparently operated by a human--was safely out of the tigers’ reach for a while, one of the tigers eventually had enough and snatched it out of the sky. The tigers then pounced on the drone, and promptly started to tear it apart in hopes of having a nice meal.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter \nThe video, which was earlier discovered by Gizmodo, is the latest animal-versus-drone video to have surfaced online.\nFrench media outlets recently published details on an experimental program within French special forces aimed at taking out drones. The special army unit has for months been training four golden eagles charged with seeking out drones and taking them down mid-air. The eagles use their talons, which can expert pressure up to 500 pounds per square inch, to snatch the eagles out of the air.\nThe tigers in the latest video seem to be lounging around when a drone operator mistakenly flew the device too close. Then they took it down.\nBut let’s hope the operators don’t do it again: Siberian tigers are endangered and countries around the world are trying to grow the species’ numbers. After the tigers started tearing apart the drone, its battery malfunctioned and started to smoke.\nWhile it thankfully didn’t explode, such battery malfunctions can catch fire and in some cases, explode. It’s yet another reminder to remember animal safety when using electronics around them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:26:11.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
