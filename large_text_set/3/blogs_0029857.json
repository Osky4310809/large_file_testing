BBC Rio Ferdinand \nThe documentary explored how to cope with grief and how Rio explained Rebecca’s death to the couple’s three young children, Lorenz, 10, Tate, eight and Tia, five. \nEventually, after speaking to other widowers and health care professionals, the 38-year-old sportsman says he managed to “switch it from dark to bright”. He started a memory jar that acts as a conduit for the kids and himself to talk about Rebecca. \nHe said: “It kind of opened everything up and it was a beautiful moment just seeing them talk happily and being joyful about their mum rather than it being sad and negative moments. \nHe also spoke honestly about understanding how people consider suicide after the death of a spouse. But also said that his children helped him to find the will to live. \nRio left viewers touched by his bravery as he opened up about his grief...
