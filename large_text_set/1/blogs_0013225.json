Last week, Married to the Mob clothing line boss Leah McSweeney called SNL ’s Michael Che “so arrogant and so rude and disrespectful” on her Improper Etiquette podcast while recounting a text exchange she had with the comedian, who she met on the elite dating app Raya.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nIn turn, screenshots of their exchange were leaked to Page Six , which appear to counter McSweeney’s description of their texts. To an outsider with no horse in this race—and from the perspective of someone who’s experienced plenty of arrogant, rude, and disrespectful behavior from strangers on apps—they seem to have been leaked to refute her characterization of their exchange. McSweeney, with whom I spoke this afternoon, contends that Che “planted” the story after listening to the podcast and leaked their text-based conversation (over the course of which McSweeney texted Che a few times to no response, and also confessed, “We have a lot of friends in common and if any of them saw this I would b so ashamed”). McSweeney says what ran on Page Six is the entirety of their communication via text.\nOn the podcast, McSweeney said, “Why are you on a dating app if you hate women? Literally, you’ve never met me and you’re texting me like I’m a stupid bitch … texting me and being mad rude. He kept just texting me, going, ‘I’m fat. Does that turn you on?’ And I’m like, ‘You’re fat? I think I’ve seen you and you’re not fat, OK.’”\nAdvertisement \n\nVia text, this is how that conversation took place:\n\n\nMcSweeney told me that she called Che “rude” because of the way he “came at [her]” in his explanation of why he didn’t want to meet up with her. This is how that went down over text:\n\nThe conversation continued from there with Che thanking McSweeney at one point for saying nice things about his work:\n\nText screenshots via Page Six . McSweeney told me she does not regret or retract her description of their interaction. I offered to her that one might surmise after reading this exchange that she felt rejected and lashed out on her podcast as a result. “That’s a very one-dimensional way of looking at it,” she said. “Yeah, it seems like the obvious but it wasn’t about the rejection at all. The way he went about it is crazy. You can say, ‘I’m not interested.’ Why are you even texting me back then? Why did you even give me your phone number? You told me to hit you up. I didn’t give you my phone number.”\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:39:40.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
