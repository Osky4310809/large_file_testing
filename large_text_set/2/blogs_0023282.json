All 5 directors nominated for Best Foreign Language Film just issued a remarkable joint statement. pic.twitter.com/3AAmpGDXfm — Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) February 24, 2017 \nThe first place viewers will likely see a statement is on the red carpet in support of the American Civil Liberties Union. The nonprofit organization, which led the lawsuits that have challenged many of Trump's policies, handed out blue ribbons to those attending the Oscars. \nExpect to see them pinned to America's favorite stars, as many shared their support for the organization in the days leading up to the Oscars. \nOn Friday, United Talent Agency and its top clients held a rally that aimed to combat what they called Trump's policies of \"exclusion and division.\" UTA also donated $250,000 to the International Rescue Committee and the ACLU. \nRelated: 2017 Oscar Nominations: Five Things to Know About 89th Academy Awards Contenders \nAt the event, actors like Jodie Foster, Michael J. Fox, Wilmer Valderrama and Keegan-Michael Key shared the aspects of America they admired, which didn't quite jibe with the president's. But it was the voice recording of a relatively unknown Iranian filmmaker — who signed the letter of concern — that was particularly poignant. Don Emmert / AFP - Getty Images \nAsghar Farhadi's film \"The Salesman\" is nominated for best foreign-language film. After Trump signed an executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, including Iran, Farhadi announced that he would not be attending the awards ceremony. \nIn the recording, he encouraged artists to \"break stereotypes\" by \"turning their cameras to capture shared human qualities.\" \nRelated: Trump Attacks New York Times Oscars Ad Before It Airs \nFarhadi isn't the only Iranian skipping the ceremonies. The film's star won't be in attendance, either. \nTaraneh Alidoosti announced that she was boycotting the ceremony on social media because \"Trump's visa ban for Iranians and others is a racist move and unacceptable.\" \nThose two Iranian stars aren't alone, as award ceremonies have grown increasingly heated when it comes to politics ever since Meryl Streep took the stage at the Golden Globes and dressed down Trump for mocking a disabled reporter and, she said, lacking empathy. \nThe trend of stars stating their dislike for the new administration didn't stop there, as the Emmys, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Film Independent Spirit Awards all had their own star-studded political intrigue. But the Academy Awards are the biggest stage of the season, and they has a history of bringing out political opinions.
