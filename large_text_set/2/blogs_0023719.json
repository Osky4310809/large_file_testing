Malaysia has refused to release the body “under the absurd pretext” that it requires a confirmatory DNA sample from Jang Nam’s family, the state-run agency said.\n“This proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicize the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality and thus attain a sinister purpose,” KCNA added.\nKCNA also characterized Malaysia’s investigation as being full of “holes and contradictions” and blasted South Korea for “kicking up a fuss” while blaming North Korea for Jong Nam’s slaying, Bloomberg News reported .\n“The biggest responsibility for his death rests with the government of Malaysia as the citizen of the DPRK died in its land,” the agency said, tiptoeing around identifying Jong Nam by name.\nThe official statement, issued in both English and Korean, repeated the North’s demand for a dual investigation with Malaysia , stressing it was ready to dispatch a delegation.\n“The unfriendly attitude of the Malaysian side found a more striking manifestation in the matter of transferring his body to the DPRK side. The DPRK … will watch the future attitude of the Malaysian side.”\nWith Post wires", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:05:20.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
