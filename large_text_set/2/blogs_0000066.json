He said the two are believed to have known each other. \n“There was some exchanging of words. At that point, one of the individuals went into his backpack, pulled out a large semiautomatic handgun. A struggle ensued, where in that struggle, one shot was fired,” said Commissioner Evans. \nEvans said the gun, a .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol, fortunately jammed after one shot was fired into the floor, and no other shots were fired. He said three building employees then pounced on the 15-year-old, holding him down and kicking the gun away.

But at the same time, I’ve seen the size of the gun. It’s unfortunate, like the Mayor said, that we have young kids running around this neighborhood with such firepower in their backpack.” \nThat young boy is due in court later Wednesday. \nNobody was injured in the incident.

Trauma teams have been sent to work with the staff. \n“Nobody was aware of this at first but within a minute of the incident we were all of a sudden being moved to a secure spot,” said employee Darren Copeland. \nWitnesses told WBZ-TV’s Christina Hager they were stunned to hear a shot fired in the busy office building, and then see police streaming in. \n“The police were telling me, ‘move out of the way, I’m chasing somebody, move out of the way,’ so I moved out of the way, and they went inside there and they caught both of them,” said witness Earnest Aponte. \nWBZ-TV’s Christina Hager reports \nMelvyn Walker captured the suspect’s arrest on cell phone video. \n“I heard screaming, too,” Walker said. “And I heard a struggle as well.” \nOne neighbor said he hoped the school department would follow the advice of the police in making the building more secure. \n“Every time we have a shooting in the City of Boston, it comes right back to the fact that young people have access to too many handguns,” said Walsh. “And we’re going to continue to work with our police department, with our partners in the community, with the neighborhoods, to try and continue to take these guns off the street.” The Bruce C. Bolling Municipal Building (File image; Boston Public Schools) \nThe Bruce C. Bolling Municipal Building, where the shooting took place, houses the Boston Public Schools District Headquarters along with the Department of Neighborhood Development. \nIt also houses retail stores and restaurants. It had been open for about an hour at the time of the shooting. \nSeveral police cruisers were present at the scene Wednesday.
