John Kasich. It takes effect in 90 days. \nIt’s a boon for a practice known as clear boarding, which has been catching on around the country. \nFannie Mae, the federal government-sponsored mortgage association, has been using the clear polycarbonate windows and doors for several years and, in November, declared plywood unacceptable for securing vacant properties. A zoning committee in Chicago debated the issue this spring. \nRobert Klein, founder of Cleveland-based clear board maker SecureView, said the Ohio law makes a bold statement against urban decay. \n“This is a significant advancement for those engaged in the battle against neighborhood blight in Ohio,” Klein said. “Plywood is an outdated solution to a growing modern-day problem.” \nPlywood has been an industry standard for securing vacated housing for so many decades that the very act of doing so is called “boarding up” the property. It’s widely available, easy to use and inexpensive. \nHowever, supporters of using a different material say plywood is susceptible to break-ins and vandalism, obstructs the visibility for first responders and sends a visual signal that depreciates surrounding property values. \nMarilyn Thompson, of APA-Engineered Wood Association, said the trade organization representing North American plywood makers views the debate as primarily aesthetic. \n“Plywood has very good structural properties, so we wouldn’t see any significant difference in terms of security,” she said. “In terms of aesthetics, if building owners want to have the option to use that, that’s fine. But to ban the use of plywood and to make it mandatory to use the clear boarding really removes options for property owners and puts an additional burden on them by removing lower cost options.” \nThompson said a 4-foot by 8-foot 15/32-inch sheet of plywood costs between $17 and $20, while a similar-sized sheet of clear polycarbonate costs about $115. \nIn Ohio, the plywood ban comes close on the heels of another new law that sped up foreclosures on vacant and abandoned properties, sometimes called zombie properties because they languish like the living dead. It establishes a fast-track system trimming Ohio’s foreclosure process from two years or more to as little as six months. \n  \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
