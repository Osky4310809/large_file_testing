Men popping the question on jumbotrons are a favorite of the genre: the public humiliation of some clueless guy rejected in front of thousands, and the resulting “o ” from the crowd, is pure candy for those seeking their schadenfreude fix. \nIn the not-so-distant past, when I saw videos like this, I had little sympathy for the men involved (yes, it is usually men doing the proposing). What an ass, I would think, to be so utterly caught up in one’s own grandiosity! You have no clue what your partner wants! How inconsiderate to put someone in that situation. \nA woman who awkwardly walks, then runs off the basketball court after telling her boyfriend “no” during the half-time show is not enjoying that moment either, and it was the dude who put her there. \nScrew that dude. \nMy judgment is less harsh these days. I have recently learned that the gap between what someone actually thinks and what you think they think can grow to be alarmingly large, even with someone you’ve been spending a lot of time with romantically. Essentially, I became “that dude”. I did something profoundly stupid for love, and it didn’t go well. \nBefore I tell you my story of woe, consider for a moment whether you, too, have done something similar. If so, there is no better time to share it than today, Valentine’s Day, when so many could benefit from hearing stories of failed romance. \nTell your story in the comments, and I’ll tell you just how, this New Year’s Eve, I found myself lying half naked on the frozen Mississippi river in a Minneapolis dog park. \n• • • \nI met “Valerie” – not her real name, though she did give me permission to write this piece – the same way I have met many others: Tinder. Yet the exchange seemed different from the start. \nValerie works in a field that allows her to ponder big, metaphysical questions of life, science, faith and philosophy. I’m a journalist, glued to current events. On our first date conversation meandered in the best way, from Rebecca Solnit to Courtney Barnett to whether a Minnesota lake beach is actually a beach or not (I said yes, she said no). She had a cracking wit and wasn’t shy about rolling her eyes if I told a bad joke. When I walked her to her bike a few hours later, it started to rain. I almost tried to kiss her there, but she had already put on her orange helmet. That would happen after the next date, at a sushi place. Sparks flew. \nWe hit a snag three months in. Which is to say, she ended things. We got along great, but certain tendencies of mine, which she correctly attributed to ADHD, made her anxious. “You mean, like, incompatible pathologies?” I suggested as she tried to explain. This was a story I’d heard before, and I couldn’t blame her. \nAbout two weeks later, we exchanged emails. That morphed into texts, and those texts soon became sexts. Then I was coming over, but why have one night when you can have two, and why not get doughnuts in the morning while you’re at it? This dragged on for another four months, with a few “breaks” thrown in between. A lot of it was wonderful, but looking back on it, I was too persistent, focused on the ways in which she would keep the door open a crack rather than how she kept trying to close it. \nShe was traveling home to see family for Christmas and wanted to take that time to consider whether we could go forward. She initially asked for no communication, but I asked if we could wish each other merry Christmas and a happy new year, and she agreed. \n“Great, something to work with,” I thought. \nFor my Christmas message, I went with what I knew might go over well: a holiday-themed sext, funny but raunchy enough not to be repeated here. She had said holiday messages were allowed, and this did technically qualify, I thought. There was a time difference to consider, so I waited anxiously for a reply, which came the next day in hashtag form. “#cheating, #definitelycheating, #Thisisgoingtobehardtogetoutofmyhead,” she said. \nShe liked it! \nWhat happened next is difficult to explain. I felt encouraged by her reply. I also felt like I had one shot left. One last chance to present myself before judge and jury before the verdict was handed down. \nI would misfire. \n• • • \nI was trying to think of how I could top my Christmas sext success when I heard the song Better Man by the soul singer Leon Bridges on the radio one afternoon. It’s about a guy who wants to get a girl back, and it resonated with me. \nWhat can I do? What can I do? \nTo get back to your heart \nI’d swim the Mississippi river \nIf you would give me another start, girl \nThe Mississippi river runs right through the Twin Cities, where I live, and I daydreamed as the song played, imagining myself jumping into the river and swimming along while Leon Bridges’ soulful voice and guitar provided the soundtrack. \n“What if I actually did it?” I thought, half-joking to myself. \nThen my eyes widened. \nI filmed the video with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. The general idea was to edit myself into the music video for Better Man, so that whenever the camera cut away from Leon Bridges and to the chorus or band members, it would instead cut to me acting out a narrative. The sequence followed the lyrics of the song and was as follows: me in a cafe, sad, pondering what to do. \nAs Bridges sings “I’d swim the Mississippi river” an idea occurs to me, and I stand up from my table, ready to embark on this new plan. Since the original music video was in black and white, my scenes were, too. \nIn the scenes that follow, I’m driving and then I’m walking up to the Mississippi river as the chorus again plays in the background. \nI had gone on a few scouting expeditions and came to the conclusion that actually jumping into near-freezing, moving water would be too dangerous. Plus, I didn’t want this to come off as too sincere or overly romantic. \nMy half-baked solution was just to pretend to swim on the ice . \nI added a few more details in an attempt to make it more over-the-top: I kept my fingerless gloves on and wore goggles. I also danced during the song break, wearing my seven-year-old daughter’s blue worm pool floatie around my waist. \nI sent the video on New Year’s Eve, with the hashtags #Notabigdeal, #itwasfun, #justathingImade, #happynewyears. \nShe replied saying Happy New Year’s and that she would watch it when she had wifi. \nThe next day, silence. \nThe day after that, more silence. \nFor a moment, I thought maybe she was taking so long to reply because she wanted to do something just as epic. \nMaybe, I thought, she’s going to reply with her own video. \nDay three: silence. \n• • • \nValerie did eventually reply, saying she had been angry but had since calmed down. When she returned, we met up and she ended things. The video had been too much. \nIn retrospect, what was really going on as I lay on that ice was really more complicated than Valerie and our convoluted situation. A few years earlier I had been through a divorce, and ultimately I had blamed myself for that relationship falling apart the way that it did. There were a few key junctures where I hadn’t tried hard enough. I was afraid of making that mistake again, and the New Year’s video was, in my mind, my last chance to prove myself to Valerie. I was like a general fighting the last war, listening to my own baggage more than I was to her, overcompensating in the present for the mistakes of the past. \nI think the same thing happened to a lot of the guys in those failed proposal videos. They got lost in their own narratives. \nIn a sense, making the video was cathartic for me. I proved to myself that I could keep trying, even when it was getting tough. It was unfair for me to burden Valerie with all that, though. She just wanted space. \nShe did forgive me, I think, and there were, thankfully, other ways in which I had been good for her. Later, we had one of those friendly sorting-it-out conversations that can occur at the end of relationships. \n“How far up my own ass did my head have to be for me to make that video?” I asked her. “Pretty fucking far,” she replied. “You might still be having vision problems.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:26:20.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
