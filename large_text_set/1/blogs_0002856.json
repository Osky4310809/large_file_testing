Police believe he was shot by an intruder.\n“Right now, we’re classifying it as a suspicious death,” said Lt. Eric Hermick with the Pennsylvania State Police. “There’s a lot of suspicious circumstances involved.”\nAuthorities say Martin was a retired sheriff’s deputy from Ohio.\nLast month, someone burglarized his home and stole a number of weapons.\n“We actually did that investigation and filed charges relevant to that investigation,” Hermick said. “He was burglarized, and there is some evidence from that that we’re looking at as well.”\n“A neighbor told me that they robbed him, stole his guns,” neighbor Neil Reddig said. “I’m thinking, I don’t know, hopefully not the intruder came back and used it on him. I don’t know.”\nPolice say the house was ransacked when they found Martin on Saturday, and there were no signs of forcible entry.\nNeighbors say they heard four to six shots around 10:30 p.m. Friday. They’re hoping to get more evidence from video surveillance cameras around the home.\n“Very scary,” Reddig said. “They said, hell, I could have been robbed or something, shot or whatever. Now, I’ll probably protect myself. I have a gun, but I think I might start carrying it.”\nReddig can’t understand why anyone would harm his neighbor.\n“Nice guy. Kept to himself,” he said. “Do anything for anybody.”\nJoin The Conversation On The KDKA Facebook Page \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T01:11:32.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
