I found it hard to reaccelerate and match them,\" Bennett said at the finish. \n\"It was a really messy sprint because everyone was so fresh but we timed it well. We came into the last corner in the lead. I wanted to wait until the final 150 meters to go because of the headwind but I should have gone with 200. You live and learn.\" \nEarlier in the morning a nervous Bennett had explained to Cyclingnews that he had never led out a rider since turning professional and that his task was to shepherd his teammate, and the World Champion, to the line. \n\"Today we were meant to go for Peter,\" he told Cyclingnews as he sheltered from the blistering heat at the finish. \n\"He came up to me in the race and gave me another chance. He just came up and asked if I was okay. I said no and that I wanted to stick to the plan. I wanted to do my job as he led me out the first day. He's the road captain and he said 'okay we go for you'. I wanted to give back for the other night but he was so willing to give a leadout.\" \nStage 2 looks set to be decided by the GC contenders and although Bennett is a sprinter he will have the chance to work for his teammates in the coming days. The next bunch sprint is likely to be on stage 3 of the race with Sagan and Bennett having another chance. \n\"Maybe I'm a bit to self critical at times and I need to relax,\" he told Cyclingnews.
