Picture: ABC Central Coast. \nThe woman went on to say the boy’s mother was “extremely anxious” that “this piece of dangerous art is still there totally out in the open to claim its next unsuspecting victim”. \nThe boy was treated at the scene by St John’s First Aid volunteers and firefighters present at the Australia Day Eve celebrations before being taken to Gosford Hospital. \nCentral Coast Council erected temporary fencing around the sculpture the following day before it was removed earlier today. \n“In relation to the reported incident at Kibble Park on Australia Day Eve, Council will be providing no comment at this time,” a spokesman said. \n“Council has temporarily removed the sculpture from the park, while it undertakes an investigation into the incident.’ media_camera A Facebook photo of the sculpture reportedly how it looked on Australia Day Eve. Picture: Facebook. \nThe prompt response by council drew mixed responses on social media with some condemning the sculpture’s placement in the first place, while others defended it. \n“About time, I always said it’s such a dangerous thing, why would u put that there!!!,” posted Natasha Jones. \nOthers, such as Stephen O’Brien, suggested there were other dangers including the nearby road but the council was not expected to be held accountable for the risk it posed. \n“Guess we better all wrap ourselves in bubble wrap since the world is such a dangerous place ...,” he wrote. \n“Hopefully we can get the council to remove all the rocks and concrete as well since anybody could trip over and smack their head on the ground, causing serious injury as well?!” \nA Gosford Hospital spokeswoman said the boy was discharged on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T07:15:08.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
