Blac Chyna on Instagram (Photo: Instagram/Blacchyna) \nAccording to a police affidavit obtained by PEOPLE at the time, officers discovered two white pills inside a sunglasses case (she said she didn't know what they were) and after testing they were revealed to be methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, known as ecstasy. \nPolice said she was \"going from extremely angry, cursing at everyone then to crying\" during the incident. Dream Kardashian (Photo: snapchat/blacchyna) \nAccording to TMZ, prosecuters dropped the charge because she had been on her best behaviour since the arrest and she completed a \"sufficient amount\" of classes. \nThe website also reports that because it was a non-violent offence, they also dismissed it. \nAfter her release, Rob Kardashian, drove 1,377 miles from Los Angeles to Austin to pick her up.
