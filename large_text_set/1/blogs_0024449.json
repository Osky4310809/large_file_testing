By CLAYX I love this movie because how Alice's story is unfold so therefore I wouldn't mind to see Alice on the Big Screen again in the future. Thanks Milla for your commitment to this franchise.... Amazing! By Rolemodel35 Slow start, but picks up shortly after. Overall very good, and a must see for Resident Evil fans!... It's Resident Evil! By racerx8 If you keep it in perspective, this was a great Resident Evil. Action was awesome! Graphics amazing! Of course, if the people had common sense, this would have been too short a movie. So look past... By tavaethegreat It was ok By jorgesando47 Not the best movie but at least they showed where Alice come from and all that... Can we get a reboot now?
