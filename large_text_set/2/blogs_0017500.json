He was very good. \n\"I am happy because the gulf in the match was very large. But we did not have the luck to capitalise. \n\"But playing this way, if we do not concede in England then we will qualify. We must not disregard what was a good performance [by Sevilla]. \n\"The unique approach of the opponent [playing on the counter] ended in a goal. These teams live off this. We live embittered by the narrow result. \n\"We were superior. We could have scored more and made more of a margin with the chances we created.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:02:18.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
