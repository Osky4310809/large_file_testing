Cuomo warned Wednesday of potential state income tax hikes of 10 to 26 percent to cover the costs of a massive Medicaid bill in the new GOP health care plan .\nFor the second day in a row, Cuomo slammed an amendment to the proposed plan to overhaul ObamaCare that would force the state to pick up $2.3 billion in Medicaid costs in 2020 that are now paid by New York’s counties outside New York City.\nThe amendment is being pushed by upstate Reps. Chris Collins of Buffalo and John Faso of Kinderhook.\n“Either, we could pass on the devastating cuts to our hospitals, nursing homes and the 40% of New Yorkers who currently receive Medicaid and health benefits. Or, we would be forced to raise state income taxes – either by increasing taxes on all New Yorkers by 10 percent, or if Collins and Faso have their way in protecting only the wealthy, on the middle class by 26 percent,” Cuomo said.\nIt’s an open question whether the state Legislature would agreed to boost income taxes.\nIn an effort to ramp up the pressure to scuttle the controversial Medicaid amendment that targets only New York and the overall House GOP health plan, Cuomo’s office released the potential impact reductions could have on hospitals in the districts of New York’s Republican congressional representatives.\nIn Rep. Dan Donovan’s district that covers Staten Island and south Brooklyn, Coney Island Hospital would lose $19.57 million, Beth Israel Hospital system, $9.3 million, SI University Hospital, $5.6 million, and Richmond U. Medical Center, $2.8 million.\nCollins defended the amendment and accused Cuomo of scare mongering.\n“Governor Cuomo and his sidekick [Lt Gov. Kathy Hochul) are using doomsday predictions to scare everyday New Yorkers into allowing Albany to continue taxing them to death. It’s absolutely disgusting the governor would threaten the middle class with a tax increase, while holding a $14 billion taxpayer funded slush fund in his back pocket,” Collins said.\n“As I have said before, if this Governor can’t find 1.5% to save in his budget, I am more than willing to find it for him.”\nThe fight over local Medicaid costs has raged for decades.\nFormer Gov. Mario Cuomo — the father of the current governor, Andrew — proposed a gradual state takeover of growing Medicaid costs from New York City and other localities in 1991.\n“In one bold step, we can dramatically improve affordable, quality public health care and relieve local government and property taxpayers of the most significant burden imposed upon them by the state of New York,” Mario said in 1991.\nAs part of deal, New York City would gradually transfer income tax revenue to Albany to help the state pay for the takeover.\nOther counties outside the city would have turned the lion’s share of sales tax revenue to help finance the takeover.\nSEE ALSO \nVoters are losing faith in new Republican health care plan 0:0 Support among American voters for the Republican health care plan... The Collins amendment, by comparison, does not require a swap of local income tax revenues and provides $2.3 billion in savings to county governments. Mario Cuomo’s plan never came to fruition,.\nIn recent years, the state has assumed more of the costs of Medicaid.\nLocalities now pay 13 percent, down from a high of 25 percent.\nAndrew Cuomo capped the Medicaid costs to localities and the state now pays for spending growth in the program.\nGov. Cuomo said his position of a state Medicaid takeover is consisted with his dad’s.\n“Of course if the localities pay the state, the state will pick up the cost. Both Governor Cuomos support that,” said the current governor’s spokeswoman, Dani Lever.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:34:22.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
