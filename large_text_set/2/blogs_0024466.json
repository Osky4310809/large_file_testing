Samsung has been leading the way with wireless charging since the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge in 2015, and the company’s new fast wireless charging standard, implemented initially in the Galaxy Note 5 two years ago, made its way to the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge last year. Now, we see the fast wireless charging pad/stand model number leak for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ . \nThe Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ model numbers are SM-G950 and SM-G955 , respectively, and the S8′s fast wireless charger has a model number to match: EP-PG950 for the upcoming Qi wireless charger base. The current fast wireless charging stand has a model number of EP-NG930, with no “940″ because of Korean tetraphobia and cultural fear of the number “4.” \nQuandt also gives the power capabilities, 5V-9V, which isn’t any different from the current Galaxy S7 wireless charging stand. What will be different is that, whereas the old wireless charging supported only micro-USB adapters, the new Galaxy S8 Qi wireless charging base will utilize USB Type-C. \nThat’s all we’re given for the new Qi wireless charging accessory or accessories (plural). Other accessories for the next Galaxy include official Samsung cases and we’re still waiting to see the external S Pen despite the constant echoes of the digital pen’s existence. \nThe Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be announced on March 29th (pending Samsung’s statement at MWC 2017 ) and launch worldwide on April 21st.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:41:24.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
