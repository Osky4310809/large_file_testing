Larry Hogan .\nSen. Bobby Zirkin , chairman of the Senate 's Judicial Proceedings Committee, said his committee is still learning details of the bill, but he expects it to advance out of his committee to the full Senate. \nAs introduced, the Maryland Law Enforcement and Trust Act would prohibit state and local governments from expending resources on immigration enforcement. \nThe version of the act passed by the House of Delegates on Monday was watered down and allows a program for screening inmates and arrestees for immigration enforcement in local jails to continue. Frederick County has a jail screening program, one is about to begin in Harford County and Anne Arundel County has applied for approval to start a program. \nUnder the revised bill, patrol officers and other government employees could not seek information or collect data solely for immigration purposes. \nHogan, a Republican, called the bill \"outrageously irresponsible\" and would \"interfere with our state and local law enforcement's ability to cooperate with federal law enforcement.\" He promised to veto the legislation if it passes. \nThe House of Delegates watered down a bill aimed at curtailing how much Maryland law enforcement officials can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\nThe bill, introduced as the Maryland Law Enforcement and Trust Act, would have halted programs in which local jails screen arrestees for... \nThe House of Delegates watered down a bill aimed at curtailing how much Maryland law enforcement officials can cooperate with federal immigration authorities. \nThe bill, introduced as the Maryland Law Enforcement and Trust Act, would have halted programs in which local jails screen arrestees for... (Pamela Wood) \nZirkin said his committee has held preliminary discussions on the bill but needs to learn more before voting. He said he looks forward to examining the House's changes to the bill. \n\"It's not an issue we know a lot about,\" said Zirkin, a Baltimore County Democrat. He said the committee needs to \"understand the ramifications\" of any bill they pass. \nSenate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said the governor overreacted. Miller called the bill \"reasonable\" and said he believes Marylanders support the idea of making it clear that people can't be questioned about their immigration or citizenship status.
