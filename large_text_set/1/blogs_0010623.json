I’ve learned so much and this is just the beginning,” she captioned her snap on Instagram. \nDuring her stay, she met empowered and determined women including 17-year-old Mary, a teen mother. “This is 17-year-old Mary who is holding her two months old child after fleeing from South Sudan to Uganda.
