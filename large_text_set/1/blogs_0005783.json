Whoever does best in the second half of the season will win it.” \nPep Guardiola’s side are also through to the last 16 of the Champions League and the fourth round of the FA Cup, with Silva shining in a 5-0 demolition of West Ham on Friday. \nMan City: From crisis to cruise control \nHe said: “We are excited about the competition and aim to win it.” \nCity last lifted the trophy in 2011, with Wigan Athletic denying Silva a second winners’ medal when they stunned Roberto Mancini’s side in 2013.
