The ruling clears the way for the pop star to finally purchase the property she’s been battling for two years to buy, reports LAist .\nPerry’s adversary in the legal battle was a group of elderly nuns of the order the Sisters of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The nuns, who had been given the residence in 1972, wanted to sell the house to local restauranteur Dana Hollister (she’s the woman behind Cliff's Edge, Brite Spot, and OSSO). \nBut the Archdiocese of Los Angeles claimed it had the power to sell the contested convent, and it wanted to sell to Perry. \nIn her ruling on Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephanie Bowick wrote, \"The court finds that the sisters did not have the authority to sell the property to Hollister. The Pope did not consent to the sale of the property to Hollister and there was no written approval from the Holy See or the archbishop.” \nMichael Locke / Curbed LA Flickr Pool This is the second time that the courts have ruled in Perry’s favor in this high-profile case. In April 2016, the courts ruled the the nuns’ sale of the convent to Hollister was invalid , opening the possibility of a sale to Perry, but that decision was overturned by an appeals court. \nPerry planned to pay the Archdiocese $14.5 million to purchase the 1927 residence, designed by architect Bernard Maybeck. The singer has expressed her desire to move into the estate \"with her mother and grandmother, sit in the meditation garden, sip green tea and find herself.\"\nJudge Gives Katy Perry The OK (Again) To Buy That Los Feliz Convent [LAist] Nuns strike back in battle with Katy Perry over beautiful convent [Curbed LA] Katy Perry May Have Defeated Nuns For Beautiful LA Convent [Curbed LA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:30:58.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
