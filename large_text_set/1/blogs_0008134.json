The house they’re at is one their father designed. Rota asks about his time undergoing Terrigenesis. He just remembers it being dark and lonely.

Fitz tells Radcliffe that Aida seems actually real, but Radcliffe says she can only mimic human emotions. Fitz thinks the Darkhold may have changed that and went mad from the flood of emotions. Radcliffe regrets creating Aida. He never envisioned her becoming an actual human. He’s not sure if killing her wouldn’t make them murderers. \nEllen argues about Vijay with Terrance Shockley, the leader of the band of Watchdogs.
