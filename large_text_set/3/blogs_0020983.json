The fifth, a 10-year-old boy, fought for his life before succumbing to his injuries Monday afternoon at Shands Hospital in Gainesville.\n“Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,” a family member later posted on Facebook.\nFlorida Highway Patrol offered few details in its official news release about the accident Tuesday. Nathan Russell, 37, whose license said he lived in Hollywood but whose family said he lived in Coral Springs, was behind the wheel of a white 2016 Chrysler 200, driving south on Interstate 75 Sunday morning.\nBeside him was his wife, Lynda Russell, 35, a nurse he married 11 years ago. In the backseat were the three children — La’Nyah Russell, 15, and the twins, Natayah and Nathan Jr., both 10.\nOf the five, only Natayah was wearing a safety belt, according to FHP. But it didn’t help her.\nNathan Russell was traveling south on Interstate 75. In a brief telephone interview Tuesday, his father-in-law, Alfred Henry, said they had been visiting a relative in Georgia and were on their way home.\nBut Russell lost control of his vehicle and drifted onto the right shoulder of the highway, smashing into the back of a stalled 18-wheeler near mile marker 397.\nNathan Jr. was in critical condition when he was taken to the hospital, according to the FHP. The details of his injuries were not included in the news release. He lasted until 12:45 p.m. Monday.\nFamily members reached by phone Tuesday were reluctant to talk.\nNicole Narae, who identified herself as Nathan Russell’s cousin, posted about the family tragedy on her Facebook page Monday afternoon, including several family pictures. “Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,” she wrote. “This one hurts. From the Bahamas to Haiti to South Florida … our hearts are broken.”\nFamily members set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for expenses. Approximately $17,000 had been raised as of Tuesday evening.\n“To lose one person is unbearable imagine losing five all at once,” wrote Caroline Petitdor, who created the page on behalf of Alfred Henry, Lynda Russell’s father.\nSome parents whose children were classmates with the Russell children were also commenting on the tragedy on Facebook.\n“We need your prayers! This one hits very close to home,” posted Francis Reyes, who said her two daughters went to school with La’Nyah and Natayah. “We are so saddened by this tragic event. The kids are shocked.”\nJasmine Rose Alexandre, who said her son knew La’Nyah from school, commented on Facebook: “[My son] is very sad. La’Nyah was known for be the sunshine in her classmates day.”\nStaff writers Rebeca Piccardo, Linda Trischitta, Mike Clary and staff researcher Barbara Hijek contributed to this report. \nrolmeda@sunsentinel.com , 954-356-4457, Twitter @rolmeda \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T15:09:40.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
