He has been in Paris for five years and now he needs to consider whether he wants to earn a lot without winning or earn and become a champion. \n\"It is not about the money. Whoever wants to buy him is going to have to pay a lot, because one thing is for certain -- if he leaves PSG, it will be to join a top European club. \n\"We have not yet seen the true Verratti. He is only 24 and he is hardly playing in the perfect surroundings.\" \nPSG surrendered a 4-0 first leg lead over Barcelona to lose 6-1 in the return leg at the Camp Nou and crash out 6-5 on aggregate. \nL'Equipe alleged that Verratti and teammate Blaise Matuidi were partying hours before heading to Barcelona, and Verratti is now taking legal action over the claim. \nHe has been linked with clubs including Barcelona, Juventus, Chelsea and Manchester United. \nDe Campli has not ruled out any option but said he doubted that Verratti would choose to move to Italy if he left the Parc des Princes. \nJonathan Johnson covers PSG and the French national team for ESPN FC.
