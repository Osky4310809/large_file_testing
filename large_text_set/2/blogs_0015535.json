Good news? Advertisement \n“It was a downer,” Anthony told reporters. “I had to cancel my trip. No refunds.” \nHe had planned on “evaluating” his situation with the Knicks over a weekend trip to Cuba and Puerto Rico, according to the New York Post . Now, he’ll have to do that evaluation as the team’s lone representative in New Orleans instead—scrolling through the vacation pictures of non-All-Star players, which makes him “jealous” to the point of already telling reporters, “I had to shut my phone off.” Advertisement \nAnthony assured the media that he was joking—“It’s a good thing, I don’t want to seem like I’m not happy about it”—but the Knicks have certainly not given him any reason to joke about needing a good vacation this winter.
