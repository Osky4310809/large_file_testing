But what if we say that this is NOT his look for the film? Well, apparently, Shahid himself confessed that his heavy beard and moustache isn’t for Padmavati. Last night at the xXx: The Return of Xander Cage premiere, Shahid was present to laud his friend and colleague Deepika Padukone on her first ever Hollywood venture. In a media interaction there Shahid said, “First of all this is not the look for Raja Rawal Ratan.. you will only know the look next year when it comes out.. we are hiding it, how that you can guess! But this is not the look for Padmavati, this is half the look for Padmavati and the other half you will see when the movie comes out.” Well, that means we are not completely wrong. This is one of his looks for the film because he himself said that this is half the look. Whatever it is, we just know one thing for sure, and that is Shahid looks really HOT in his new avatar.

Umm.. we shot for about 25 days.. a lot more still to do. Its a privilege to be with Mr Bhansali and when you get on the sets, he puts things together, the way he makes the set, the way he makes his movies.. it’s really really a privilege to be an artist working in that atmosphere.” \nTalking about Padmavati, it is directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and is a period drama. This is his first collaboration with Sasha but with Ranveer and Deepika he have already done two films together (Bajirao Mastani and Ram Leela) and they were both super hit at the box office. So with Padmavati too, we are expecting that it will be a masterpiece by the visionary director.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T13:34:55.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
