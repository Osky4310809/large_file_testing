Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams , fresh off opening a Lincoln Park location, are coming to the West Loop’s Randolph Row. Not to be outdone, Graeter’s Ice Cream , has also announced an opening date for their second suburban shop. Jeni’s, which has three Chicago locations, including Lakeview and Wicker Park, should open in late 2017, according to Crain’s . They’re coming to 911-915 W. Randolph St. and will take up about 1,500 square feet. Jeni’s officials weren’t immediately reached. Graeter’s, which has yet to find a suitable space in the city, opened a Northbrook location in May 2015 . Their second location, 940 Green Bay Road in Winnetka, should open on March 10, according to a news release. Oh, and if Buckeye ice cream doesn’t float your boat, Beverly’s own Original Rainbow Cone has announced a March 4 opening date for the 2017 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:17:17.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
