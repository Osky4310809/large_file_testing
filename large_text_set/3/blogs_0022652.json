We named him after a singer named Romeo Santos that my husband and I both love.’\nJuliet’s mother said: ‘We had picked the name out months ago. We wanted a J name to go with our son’s name, Jonas. We picked Juliet because we were watching the TV show ‘Psych’ and the characters’s name is Jules.’\nCassie, who took the picture, said: ‘Both babies have full heads of hair and already make the cutest couple.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:40:38.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
