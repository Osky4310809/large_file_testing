Mine are to only drink light beer on days that end in “Day” and stop going to the pizzeria at 3am just because my fridge is empty and hummus + carrots is a garbage hippie snack. But of course Taco Bell is here to screw up all my New Years Resolutions about livin’ my best life when it comes to trying to like a rabbit.\nTaco Bell is introducing chips made from fried chicken. You dip them in Lava Sauce, which is THE BOMB for anyone who remembers when they debuted it in 2008.\nvia Brand Eating :\nThe “chips” are crispy-fried, marinated white chicken meat in the shape of a tortilla chip. A cup of lava sauce is included with every six-piece order. If you prefer to forgo some of the heat (the chips are also spicy), you can opt for nacho cheese or spicy ranch sauce instead.\nThe Volcano Crispy Chicken Chips are priced at $1.99 for an order of six and $3.99 for an order of 12 (which includes two dips). Additionally, there’s the $5 Volcano Crispy Chicken Chips Big Box, which includes a six-piece order of the “chips,” Crunchy Taco, Burrito Supreme, Cinnamon Twists, and medium fountain drink.\nMunchie heaven. You’re doing the Lord’s work, Taco Bell.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:31:46.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
