Shortly after the attack, India conducted an alleged 'surgical strike' in Pakistan ─ a claim Pakistan has strongly rejected. \nIntermittent ceasefire violations across the Line of Control and Working Boundary have become commonplace as tensions simmer between both countries. \nAlthough PM Modi paid a 'surprise' visit to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on his birthday at the end of 2015 ─ a move that appeared to promise better relations between the neighbouring countries in the coming year ─ Pak-India ties in 2016 started off on a shaky note after the Pathankot siege which India blamed on Jaish-i-Mohammad.\nFollowing Indian accusations of Jaish involvement in the attack, Pakistani authorities cracked down on the group, sealing a Jaish-run seminary in Sialkot and taking group leader Masood Azhar into protective custody.\nThe UN banned Jaish in 2001 but India’s efforts to get restrictions imposed on Azhar after the Mumbai attacks did not bear fruit because China did not allow them to be imposed.\nOn February 18, a list of 11 individuals and one organisation \"linked to terrorism in India\", was submitted to the 1267/1989/2253 ISIL (the militant Islamic State group) and Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee.\nChina has, since then, blocked India's proposal twice and extended its hold on India's bid to ban the Jaish chief at the UN once. \nZakaria today alleged, \"India has in fact deployed terrorism as an instrument of state policy, and has itself been involved in perpetrating, sponsoring, supporting, and financing terrorism\" while claiming to denounce terrorism. \n\"It is clear that India’s unfounded allegations against Pakistan are in fact aimed at masking its own terrorist activities in Pakistan,\" the FO spokesperson said.\nHe added that Pakistan had been a direct victim of India's \"state-sponsored terrorism\", referring to the arrest of suspected Research and Analysis Wing agent Kulbhushan Yadhav, which he termed as \"yet another proof of Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan.\" \n\"With such duplicitous behaviour and blood on its hands, India has little credibility on counter-terrorism,\" he said, adding that Pakistan will share dossiers of alleged Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan with the UN and members of the international community soon. \nExplore: Insufficient evidence delays Jadhav dossier: Aziz \nZakaria claimed that India's statements are an attempt at \"diverting the attention of the international community from the grave violations of human rights and state sponsored terrorism perpetrated by the Indian occupying forces in the Indian-held Kashmir as well as diverting the attention of the international community from the grave violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism perpetrated by Indian occupying forces in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\"\nThe FO said that Pakistan has made significant contributions and rendered enormous sacrifices in the success of the international community’s counter-terrorism efforts.\n\"We are deeply committed to this common cause and look forward to continuing close cooperation with the international community in this collective endeavour,\" he said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T11:19:30.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
