But it looks like that's not the case this time around. \n\"He's discussed his ideas so I could understand the character, but other than that I'm not involved, creatively, at all,\" del Toro told IGN of his role in Death Stranding. \n\"This is entirely Kojima-san's game. I think it's gonna be a fantastic game, 100 per cent. But this is him and his ideas. I'm just a puppet in his hands,\" the Pacific Rim director added in a metaphor a little on the nose given the marionette-like soldiers on cables emanating from Mads Mikkelsen's character in the trailer. \n\"My contribution is limited to being a cheerleader for his ideas and being scanned for long hours at a time. That's about it,\" del Toro reaffirmed. \nLittle is known about Death Stranding's gameplay or plot other than it will be a third-person sci-fi action game featuring an open-world. The title will be exclusive to PS4 and is expected to launch before the 2020 summer olympics.
