Aside from the fact that she was a big fan favourite when she participated in the British reality T.V. show, Big Brother , she even conducted fitness sessions during the IIFA awards the last couple of years, in Spain and Dubai. She even held a session at the Google headquarters in California, on her recent trip to America. \nRegarding the tour, Shilpa has said, \"The organisers heard about the tour I did in the US recently, and approached me with this concept. I loved the idea of doing a fitness world tour since it allows me to meet and share my fitness mantra with people of different cultures and nationalities, also facilitating a healthy exchange of ideas. Fitness and wellness today are priority, and almost everyone wants to adopt a healthy lifestyle. We are working on the dates and discussing ways to make this tour interactive and interesting.\" The tour will cover four countries, the USA, Canada, UK and Australia, and will begin in October. According to a source, the sessions will also be customised to each of the target participants, and will feature aerobics, yoga, and Bollywood-style Zumba.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:55:18.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
