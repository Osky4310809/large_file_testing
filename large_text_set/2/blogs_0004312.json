Cruz, Zambales Mayor Luisito Marty allegedly issued a memorandum in 2009 directing the municipal treasurer not to accept occupation fees from holders of Mineral Production-Sharing Agreement without securing first a mayor's permit from his office. According to the ombudsman, the rule “encroaches upon the lawmaking power of Congress.” File MANILA, Philippines — Mayor Luisito “Chito” Marty of Sta. Cruz, Zambales was charged before the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan for allegedly abusing his authority to stop the operations of two mining firms found to have been compliant with environmental safety and standards. The cases, filed recently by the Office of the Ombudsman, involve two counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act 3019 (RA 3019) or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and one count of usurpation of legislative powers under Article 239 of the Revised Penal Code. Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 prohibits a public official from giving unwarranted benefit, advantage of preference to any party or from causing any party, including the government, undue injury. Deputy Special Prosecutor Manuel Soriano Jr. from the ombudsman's Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) said Marty “acted with evident bad faith” when it refused in 2011 to grant business permits to Zambales Diversified Metals Corporation (ZDMC) and Zambales Chromite Mining Company Inc. (ZCMC) “despite their compliance with all the requirements prescribed by law and applicable rules and regulations.” Marty also allegedly issued a memorandum dated Dec. 2, 2009 directing the municipal treasurer not to accept occupation fees from holders of Mineral Production-Sharing Agreement or MPSA without securing first a mayor's permit from his office. The ombudsman said such rule imposed by Marty “encroaches upon the lawmaking power of Congress” since a mayor's permit is not a prerequisite prescribed by Congress for the acceptance of occupation fees under Republic Act 7942 or the Philippine Mining Act of 1995. The ombudsman said because of Marty's directive in his memorandum, the municipal treasurer refused to receive occupation fees from ZDMC, which at that time had a duly registered MPSA with the government. The ombudsman said Marty's action not only caused undue injury to ZDMC which was prevented from operating in Sta. Cruz but also to the provincial and the municipal governments which were deprived of incomes or revenues from occupation fees that should have been collected from an MPSA holder as provided under RA 7942. The ombudsman set Marty's bail at P70,000.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:42:45.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
