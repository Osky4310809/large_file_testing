Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and Mr. Trudeau, accompanied by his wife, Sophie, watched an artistic tribute to the virtues of embracing foreigners, President Trump was proposing to eliminate federal funding of the arts and to ban travel from parts of the Muslim world.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Although the musical has been in development for years, it arrives on Broadway at a complex moment for Canada’s relationship with its southern neighbor. The Trump administration is demanding to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement — a pact strongly supported by Mr. Trudeau; the United States ban on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries, blocked on Wednesday by a federal judge , has set off a surge in asylum seekers fleeing from the United States to Canada , where they have largely been welcomed; and Mr. Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate a federal program aimed at cleaning up the Great Lakes, which over 10 million Canadians rely on for their drinking water. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In remarks to the audience before the show, and to reporters afterward, Mr. Trudeau chose his words carefully. He described “Come From Away” as a testament to the deep friendship between the United States and Canada, and said disagreements were to be expected between allies.

Then, pressed by Tom Brokaw of NBC on differences about refugees, he said, “I know — and I’ve always felt, for Canada — that we recognize that diversity is a great source of strength, and that’s something we’re open to in the world.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Canadians in the audience were more explicit in seeing the show as a moment to highlight how Canada’s welcoming of refugees contrasts with America’s harsher policy. “Canada understands these people are just looking for security and a safe place for their families,’’ said Sophie de Caen, 57, who moved to New York from Montreal, where she works for the United Nations Development Program, which helps Syrian refugees, among others. “As we can see in this show, Canadians have a generosity of spirit. We accept diversity.” \nAdvertisement Renee Beaumont, 48, who moved to New York from Vancouver years ago, showed up at the musical wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words, “I am an immigrant.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
