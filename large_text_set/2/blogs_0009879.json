You’ll be seeing that sometime next week,” he said.\nThe president didn't mention what the measure would entail and White House aides would not elaborate further, The Hill reported.\nHis remarks came after reports indicated the White House is considering drafting a new executive order that could clear legal hurdles.\nThe initial order blocked people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days and placed four-month hold on resettling refugees, while blocking refugees from Syria indefinitely.\nTrump also said that the White House would continue the court battle over his existing travel order following the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to keep it on hold. \"We will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately I have no doubt that we will win that particular case,” he said.\nIn answer to another reporter's question, Trump said that he would stick to his goal of implementing “extreme vetting” for refugees and people entering the U.S. from terrorist hotbeds.\nHe said that in the short period of time that he's been president, he's learned \"tremendous things\" -- meaning intelligence information -- not available to him before he was president.\n\"There are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that, right now,\" Trump said. \"We will not allow that to happen. We’ll be going forward and we'll be doing things to continue to make our country safe. It will happen rapidly and we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.”\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/10/president-trump-says-new-national-security-measures-are-coming-next-week/", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCCyxNPMO84", "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/318961-trump-hints-at-new-travel-order-coming-next-week", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmCuABOTrzI"], "published": "2017-02-10T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:19:28.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
