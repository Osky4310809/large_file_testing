Getty Nicholas Kamm By Charles P. Pierce Feb 3, 2017 This is not how this works. This is not how any of this works. From The Washington Post : \nThe number came out during a hearing in a lawsuit filed by attorneys for two Yemeni brothers who arrived at Dulles International Airport last Saturday. They were coerced into giving up their legal resident visas, they argue, and quickly put on a return flight to Ethiopia. \"The number 100,000 sucked the air out of my lungs,\" said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center, who represents the brothers. The government attorney, Erez Reuveni from the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation, could not say how many people with visas were sent back to their home countries from Dulles in response to the travel ban. However, he did say that all people with green cards who came through the airport have been let into the United States.   100,000 visas.
