Benaud tribute: Fans dress up like legendary commentator \nHandscomb, playing in his fourth Test, had resumed on 40 with Australia 365-3 and brought up his second Test century with a single off his 194th ball. \nBut the 25-year-old was out in bizarre circumstances when a television review showed his bat had dislodged a bail while playing a cut shot, resulting in a rare hit-wicket dismissal. \n\"Any time you can make a Test hundred is always going to feel amazing. It's just been incredible,\" said Handscomb, who will play for Yorkshire this season.
