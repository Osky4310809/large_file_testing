(AP Photo/Brandon Dill) \nVince Carter rolled back the years to score 24 points as the Memphis Grizzlies outgunned the Milwaukee Bucks 113-93 on Monday. \nCarter, 40, making his first start of the season, scored 24 points as Memphis ended a five-game losing streak against the Bucks at FedExForum. \nCarter — who came in for injured forward Chandler Parsons — produced a flawless shooting display which included six three-pointers. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe 18-year veteran also added five rebounds, three steals and two assists. \n“Better late than never,” Carter said of his performance. “I just tried to go in and do my job. I didn’t realize (the perfect shooting performance) until Chandler said something to me. I’d rather have not heard it.” \nCarter’s points haul made him the first 40-year-old in NBA history to make at least five three-pointers in a game. \n“He never ceases to amaze me,” Grizzlies coach David Fizdale said. “I challenge the veterans to give more, to invest more and the guy just keeps coming. I don’t know how you can ever write him off. He is such a pro.” \nCarter’s tally made him the oldest player to score at least 24 points in a game since Michael Jordan hit 25 points as a 40-year-old in 2003. \nTeam-mate Marc Gasol said Carter had been an invaluable presence in the Grizzlies locker room throughout the season despite limited game time. \n“I don’t think I’ll be playing when I’m 40,” Gasol said. “I’ll be done. Maybe I’ll be (playing) at the YMCA or something, but not in the NBA.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T12:36:48.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
