Crew’s ongoing collaboration with New Balance continues this Spring 2017, as the duo introduces their latest take on the 997 silhouette.\nInspired from a popular espresso drink – cortado – it’s essentially a beverage that consists of espresso coffee mixed with an equal amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity.\nEmploying the drink’s distinct colors across the runner’s entire profile — a blend of cream, white and brown are prominent throughout the sneaker’s premium mixed material construction of suede panels, mesh underlays and leather accents. Subtle hits of grey along its quarter and laces further provide a complementing finish to its tasty-looking design altogether.\nExtremely limited in quantities, availability at New Balance retailers is scheduled for this Saturday, March 25 . \nRetail price is set at $210.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:00:37.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
