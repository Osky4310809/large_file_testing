As with the recently-launched coupe , the cabriolet is expected to adopt most of the sedan’s powertrain line-up comprising petrol and diesel variants, as well as a full-blooded AMG model – a first for a two-door E-Class . \nThe E-Class Cabriolet’s fabric top is said to take just 20 seconds to fully open or close, and as in Mercedes’ alfresco fashion, will come equipped with the automaker’s own Airscarf neck-heating and Aircap wind deflector systems.

This temporary ruling ended last December, which means Airscarf business now proceeds as usual. \nSPYSHOTS: Mercedes-Benz E-Class Cabriolet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:51:56.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
