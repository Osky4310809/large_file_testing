The report notes Apple is not planning to dump Intel, which makes the processors for Macs, anytime in the near future, but that a new Apple-made chip might show up in the new version of the MacBook Pro that may release later this year, according to the report. \nInstead, the new Apple chip, codenamed T310, will be based on the embedded processor currently used in the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which is used for the computer's eponymous Touch Bar technology as well as Touch ID. In the new MacBook Pro coming later this year, the new Apple chip could run the laptop's low-power mode to fetch emails and other data while the computer is asleep, leading to lower power consumption and better battery life. \nApple leadership has implied some of the reason for complaints about Apple's latest laptops have been related to Intel chip limitations. Apple is also suing its primary mobile silicon partner, Qualcomm, for $1 billion .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:02:14.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
