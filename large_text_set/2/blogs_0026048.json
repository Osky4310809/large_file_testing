Amal, who is pregnant with twins, and husband George Clooney were spotted leaving a Paris hotel, where they’ve been staying in France. Wearing a floral-embellished dress paired with fashionable knee-high boots, a patterned wool trench coat and oversized sunglasses, Amal gave her baby bump a pop of style. The look follows similar fashion statements made by the 39-year-old attorney as she’s made her baby-bump debut in Paris over the weekend. Previously, the Clooneys were spotted taking selfies with fans on Saturday night, following their attendance at the 42nd César Awards on Friday. Photo: Splash News At the “French Oscars,” Amal wowed in a stunning custom-made Atelier Versace gown, which featured white-to-black ombré feathers and highlighted her growing pregnancy. She completed her ultra-glam look with a white shrug, statement earrings, big, bouncy curls and her signature red pout. Friday night’s event marked Amal’s first official red carpet appearance since news broke of her pregnancy earlier this month. \"Beyoncé is not the only superstar expecting twins . Congratulations are in order for George and Amal Clooney,\" Chen announced on the CBS daytime program. \" The Talk has confirmed that the 55-year-old superstar and his highly accomplished 39-year-old attorney wife are expecting twins. Give her the armrest, by the way, she's pregnant!\" George and Amal Clooney Hit Their First Red Carpet Since Pregnancy Announcement Since then, there’s been a flurry of excitement as Amal gets closer to her expected June birthdate. \"We are really happy and really excited,\" Clooney told French film journalist Laurent Weil on his program Rencontres de Cinema on French TV's Canal+ ahead of the César Awards. \"It's going to be an adventure.” In another interview with French outlet Paris Match , the 55-year-old actor admitted that he and Amal have been considerably more cautious in anticipation of their arrival. \"How can we not be anxious when faced with this immense responsibility? To give birth to a child in this world -- nevermind two! We are very happy, very excited, but also a bit nervous, it's normal,\" he shared. Something not quite normal about the couple, however, is Amal's line of work as an international human rights lawyer, which means frequently traveling to dangerous destinations. The lawyer has even recently taken on ISIS on behalf of her client, Nadia Murad, a human trafficking survivor. \"We decided to be much more responsible, to avoid the danger. I will not go to South Sudan anymore and or the Congo [and] Amal will no longer go to Iraq and she will avoid places where she knows she is not welcome,\" George explained . \"Before, I did not care. I would even say that there was a pretty exciting side to going where no reporter had ever been.\" RELATED SLIDESHOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:55:57.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
