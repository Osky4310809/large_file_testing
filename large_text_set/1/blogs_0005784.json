My choice would be Mike Smith with Norv Turner as OC. realfootballfan says: Jan 7, 2017 8:57 PM \nYeah, turn your rutterless franchise over to a nondescript 30-year-old in the 2nd largest market in the country with a budding bust QB on hand. What could go wrong? And some of you are beefing with Anthony Lynn who actually has had some buzz in the past getting all of these interviews and interest. MichaelEdits says: Jan 7, 2017 8:58 PM \nThe biggest challenge for the Rams will be finding someone willing to take the job. They’re an even bigger dumpster fire than Cleveland. Or San Francisco. Or my underwear drawer. jsbrasha says: Jan 7, 2017 8:58 PM \nEven as an active Skins fan I have no idea if this kid is any good. Jay Gruden runs the offense and called 3/4 of the plays, so it’s really tough to assess what McVay added. I would be amazed if a team actually hired him as an HC. In fact, it is such a stretch given the far more proven people available that I wonder if it’s a favor to his influential grandfather? arctantheta says: Jan 7, 2017 9:01 PM \nSounds like a great way to transition from a “player’s coach” and a lack of discipline on the field… Jan 7, 2017 9:06 PM \nSo the other nine names listed are just window dressing? abninf says: Jan 7, 2017 9:09 PM \nYou gots to be joking. scoreatwill says: Jan 7, 2017 9:25 PM \nWell LA fans are you happy with this potential hire? Welcome to the Kroenke sports franchise world of champions. thevauntedchris says: Jan 7, 2017 9:28 PM \njsbrasha says: Jan 7, 2017 8:58 PM Even as an active Skins fan I have no idea if this kid is any good.

McVay is THE play caller. It’s what he’s known for and players have called him a genius. What that means? No idea, but he calls the plays and i’d bet he’ll be a head coach within 3 years. All these teams aren’t stupid. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
