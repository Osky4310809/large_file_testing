He says, “I think art is inherently political,” and he supports any artists who speak out about politics at the awards show.\nAnthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU told Page Six in a statement, “The support of the entertainment community for the ACLU’s work protecting our civil liberties has been nothing short of spectacular, and tonight is no exception. Their voices are crucial in our fight to defend the Constitution and its promise of equality and justice for everyone in our country — no matter who they are and where they come from.”\nBest actor nominee Casey Affleck also wore the ribbon at Saturday’s Independent Spirit Awards, where he won the award for best male lead.\n  WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:50:52.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
