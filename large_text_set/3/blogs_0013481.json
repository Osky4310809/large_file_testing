Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA brave female police officer has told the inquest into two deaths at a Welsh hostel how she tackled a man covered in blood who was 'growling like a demon'. \nPC Kelda Griffiths also said that she wasn't sure she would survive the incident as soon as she walked into the room and to be confronted by horrifying scenes - and thought 'I love you mum and dad'. \nShe was one of four officers who tried to restrain ex-convict Matthew Williams, 34, after he killed shopworker Cerys Yemm, 22, in his hostel room. \nPC Griffiths also said she feared he would bite her leg as he lashed around on the floor. \nShe told an inquest that Willliams - who later died after being Tasered by police - \"didn’t seem human\" when she walked in to find him lying over the body of his young female victim whose face was disfigured. \nPC Griffiths said: \"The shouting and growling were demonic. \n\"It was like something you see on TV, not in reality.” Cerys Yemm was attacked by Matthew Williams in the hostel (Photo: Social Media) \nAsked how she felt as she went into the room to confront terrifying scenes, PC Kelda Griffiths said: “As I stood there, I just remember thinking I love you mum and dad - I didn’t know if I’d survive the incident.” \nPC Griffiths, 39, told the inquest that she remembered seeing Cerys' face which was \"horrific\". \nShe said: \"I was shouting: 'Calm down Matthew, calm down Matthew or I'll have to Taser you again.' \n\"But there was no calming him. I did not want to take my eyes off Matthew. My leg was close to his mouth and I was worried he'd bite me. \n\"He was lashing around, his head was banging on the floor. \n\"As much as we were shouting 'calm down', there was no stopping him. He had unbelievable strength.\" Matthew Williams was staying in the hostel after being released from prison (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nThe plucky policewoman then used a training tactic to apply a pressure point behind Williams' ear four times to try to subdue him but without success. \nShe was struggling with Williams as three other officers tried to fasten footstraps on him between his ankles and his knee. \nPC Griffiths also told day four of the inquest in Newport, South Wales, that Williams was uncontrollable even after the third time he was Tasered. \nWhen PC Alan Cottrell said he was going to have to Taser Williams again she said: \"Go on then, I thought it was the correct thing to do.\" \nShe told the hearing: \"He was still lashing around and he needed to be brought under control for his own safety. Cerys Yemm was found dead in the hostel room with her face disfigured (Photo: Social Media) \nPC Griffiths said she put her arm over Williams' mouth and she could still feel him breathing as he was taken away. \nShe also said that a brown envelope was found on Williams' when he was arrested at the Sirhowy Arms hotel - a \"halfway house\" at Argoed, near Caerphilly, South Wales - in November 2014. \nIt was opened and PC Griffiths says that she can remember seeing a \"clear packet with a large quantity of white powder\" inside. \nShe added that she stayed with Mandy Miles, the owner of the hotel, and other residents, who were in shock.

I was concerned about Mandy Miles and the other residents. \n\"The residents were crying. One female resident was particularly shocked. Mandy also was.\" \nPC Griffiths says that she later learned about Williams' death after she had collected a pair of gloves. \nThe inquest in Newport continues.
