It is a big challenge for me,\" Pogba told SFR Sport . \n\"I could also have joined Real Madrid or Barcelona, who were interested in signing me. But I chose to return to United because I followed my heart. \n\"I want to win trophies with Manchester United, I never won anything here. I always told myself that I would one day return to United. It is a club I love a lot and I had unfinished business here. I left because I wanted to play more, but I felt that I was not done here yet. \n\"I am not even thinking about the transfer fee. I came here to play football.\" \nPogba has developed into a key figure at United after a difficult start to his second spell at Old Trafford, but he struggled in the 1-1 draw with Liverpool and conceded the penalty that led to James Milner's opener by handling in the area.
