I had to defend myself so that’s what happened.\n“You never know, things happen. I was just ready to protect myself. He threw the first punch. I had to do something.”\nDuring a dead ball in the third quarter of the Raptors’ 122-120 overtime win over the Bulls, Ibaka elbowed Lopez in the back. Lopez then swiped at Ibaka’s arm while he held the ball. \nThe two then got into a shoving match, with multiple players and officials coming to restrain them from each other. Lopez then threw a punch at Ibaka before the Raptors big man retaliated with a lanky jab of his own.\nBoth Lopez and Ibaka were ejected immediately.\n“What happened was we were playing physical basketball and he got frustrated,” Ibaka told reporters after the game. “He kind of bumped me, I kind of bumped him a little bit. Then he got mad and slapped the ball out of my hands. Then we started talking [trash] and then he punched me.”\nLopez and Ibaka throwing punches pic.twitter.com/CMe51Fe8Bq \n— Stephen Noh (@StephNoh) March 22, 2017 Ibaka, who the Raptors acquired near the trade deadline , said it was frustrating to have to watch the remainder of the game from the locker room. Toronto trailed by double digits at the time of the fight but rallied back to force overtime and win by two.\nThe Raptors forward, who said he did not start the fight, said he hopes the NBA can help diffuse those altercations before they get physical.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:16:38.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
