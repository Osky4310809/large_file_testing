Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. \nHe alleged that the project would not achieve its objective of increasing the water holding capacity of the lake, as the silt would only be moved from one part of the lake to another.   \nBDZ filed a P6-billion lawsuit for breach of contract against the Philippines after the scrapping of the deal. \nFinance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III also said they will review the ruling. \n“We just got the documents a few days ago so we’ll go over it carefully and we’ll see what legal remedies there are. If we have to pay, we will pay,” Dominguez was quoted as saying. The Belgian embassy in the Philippines has yet to comment on the matter.
