Guests will be among the first to explore Tony Stark’s latest innovations up close and fly in a gravity-defying Iron Wing flight vehicle in Iron Man Experience. He has also made Hong Kong the Asia headquarters of Stark Industries hereafter.\nGuests will make their way to the Hong Kong Stark Tower powered by the arc reactor and whizz alongside Iron Man through streets that resemble those in West Kowloon and downtown, and fly over iconic Hong Kong landmarks like Tsing Ma Bridge, Victoria Harbour and the city’s pristine mountain ranges.\nThe attraction also features the Iron Man Tech Showcase, which gives guests a personal encounter with Iron Man himself, and the Become Iron Man interactive game. Guests can also choose from a variety of Iron Man-themed food and beverage experiences and merchandise offerings.\nThe opening of Iron Man Experience continues a period of growth at Hong Kong Disneyland with more on the way in the months ahead. A third resort hotel, Disney Explorers Lodge, will open later in the first half of the year.\nKeep checking the Disney Parks Blog for more updates from Hong Kong Disneyland.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:33:12.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
