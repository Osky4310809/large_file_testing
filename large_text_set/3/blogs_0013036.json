It included oil paintings on un-primed and weathered board; sumi ink drawings; photogenic drawings of the light and atmospheric conditions of the four major epochs up to the current Anthropocene ; a layered sun combining basalt, calfskin, bone an silver wire; and plant pressings from the 1825 Franklin Arctic expedition, on public display for the first time. \nThe exhibition has prompted a number of reviews in English-language and French media, including the Apollo art magazine and the French weekly Télérama, which said the show was “beautiful and intelligent: two adjectives rare(ly strung) together.” Apollo’s Tom Jeffreys added “McDonald commemorates the vast diversity of the environment we inhabit and explores our equally diverse responses to it. She does so deftly and with an aesthetic that is at once coherent, understated and quietly powerful”.

Photograph: Pierre Rateau \nAlthough her work is driven mainly by her fascination with the corrosion, compression and expansion of materials, McDonald is resolutely a visual artist, and says the climate change theme gravitated to her rather than the other way round. “My work is about the spirit of discovery of what is still unknown to science, going beyond the edge of the universe and exploring the layers that go back to our origins.” \nHer fascination with nature and materials began early. “As a young child, I was always looking under rocks, and I remember the first time I held a meteorite – it was startling to hold something that came from somewhere else in our solar system.” Although fundamentally a painter, McDonald’s works also spans installation, sculpture, and sound.

Although created to mark the launch of the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Solar Orbiter mission in 2018, one visitor said it reminded her of a music score. \nShe found that less disconcerting than the music that accompanied a four-minute film, At the Edge of Visibility, and echoed the sound of dying glaciers in the Arctic Circle. “It made me feel as though I were the sole survivor on Earth, and contrasted strongly with the optimism I felt in the paintings.” \nAnother visitor to the work, Marilyn Smith, executive director of the Energy Action (EnAct) multimedia project, which aims to remind us that energy underpins everything we do, did not feel the same optimism. For her, the exhibition gave a sense of what CO2 emissions really mean. “It makes the invisible visible, and seems to ask whether we have reached the tipping point [of no return] in climate change.” \nMcDonald’s work is “provocative, complex and profoundly moving,” says Terry McMahon, an Irish film director, writer and actor. “Her interrogation of humankind’s fragile position in the universe is a daring assault on the senses that plunges the viewer into a river of history that goes right to the core of our existence. Yet, rather than these waters being dark, her show somehow reveals what a miracle our species is.” Crystalline: art from the Arctic, space and beyond - in pictures Read more \nPace is a constant preoccupation for McDonald. “Looking back at our past gives us an understanding of time and our role in nature,” she says. “The vast diversity of the environment we inhabit has always percolated my projects, particularly the pace of human time with the slow disclosure of organic growth and change.” For her, pace is also at the core of a painting itself, for both the artist and the viewer. “There is something interesting about the act of painting in such a fast and image-saturated world. I think it has something to do with the slowing down of the process of painting, both in the making and viewing.” \nMcDonald is now working on a series of larger paintings. These pieces were inspired by a collection of photographs of the tragic 19th century Northwest Passage expeditions , which she found at the National Library of Oslo. “I was transfixed by the composition and shadows of a time gone by, which seemed to be erased in places,” she says. “The plates themselves seemed apocalyptic.” With this new work, she further develops her research and enquiry into the properties of materials and the relationship between humans and the natural world. “The narrative appeals to me as a metaphor for the process of painting,” she adds. \nBefore the end of the year, McDonald hopes Crystalline will be shown in Ireland, the UK and by the European Space Agency. New work for international art fairs with Gibbons & Nicholas , an exhibition at Paris Photo in November and a solo show at the Catherine Hammond Gallery, Ireland, are also under way.
