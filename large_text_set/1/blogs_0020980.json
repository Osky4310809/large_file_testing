Image copyright AFP Image caption The blast at the weekend killed dozens of people \n\"Altaf couldn't return to find Zain immediately because there was a commotion and people were running helter-skelter all over the place,\" says Sabil Hussain, whose poultry shop is 10 minute's walk from the site of the blast. \n\"Half an hour later I went home to find Altaf in a state of shock. He was pale. He said he couldn't find Zain but was able to find his shoes, a pair of worn-out trainers, which he brought home.\" \nZain was proclaimed dead at a hospital where local transporters had rushed all the dead and injured. \nTwenty-five people were killed on the spot. \nThe attack is the eighth major bombing in Parachinar since 2007. More than 500 people have died in these attacks. Many more have been killed in smaller attacks. \n\"By this count, Parachinar is the second most frequently targeted city by the militants after Peshawar,\" says Haji Faqir Hussain, the head of a council of elders of local tribes. War with Taliban \nSaturday's blast came weeks after the head of a Pakistan Army brigade stationed in the region directed local tribes to hand over heavy weapons to the government by early February. \nThe semi-autonomous tribal areas of Pakistan turned into large privately owned dumps of heavy weapons which proliferated because of the Afghan war in the 1980s. Image copyright AFP Image caption Parachinar's market lay in disarray after the bombing - its eighth in 10 years \nThe two tribes of Kurram - the Turi and the Bangash - own scores of light and heavy machine-guns, rocket-propelled grenades and even a few anti-aircraft guns, held in community-managed stockpiles in several locations along the border of Kurram Agency, where Parachinar is the main town. \nThe tribes are reluctant to part with their weapons for two reasons. \nFirst, Kurram is the only one among Pakistan's seven semi-autonomous tribal districts which is inhabited by Shia Muslims. \nThe district is surrounded on three sides by Afghan territory where elements linked to the Pakistani Taliban and the so-called Islamic State group have carved sanctuaries. These elements adhere to a hard-line Sunni version of Islam which is fiercely anti-Shia. \nThey see Shias as heretics and consider it their sacred duty to eliminate them from the face of the Earth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T04:33:19.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
