And while his predecessors may have thought twice about instigating personal vendettas with celebrities, Trump has no such qualms. Look no further than his latest Twitter spat, one that has seen the commander of the world’s largest military lash out at Snoop Dogg. \nCan you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg , failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2017 \n\nThe situation that President Trump is referring to is a new music video for “ Lavender ,” a track by BADBADNOTGOOD and Kaytranada which was given a lush visual makeover this week by Snoop Dogg. The clip sees Snoop pointing a gun at a clown made to look strikingly similar to our orange-tinted protector of the Constitution, and our Commander-in-Chief is having none of it. \nAside from insinuating that Snoop’s career is “failing,” Trump points out that had the rapper made a similar piece of art that depicted former President Obama, he would be facing “jail time!” There is also the distinct possibility that the leader of the world’s largest economy may be harboring a grudge against Snoop for taunts he had to endure at his recent roast on Comedy Central. To jog your memory:\n\nHere’s hoping Mr. President will regain some cool and not abuse his power in punishing the rapper for his latest comments. Revisit the video for “Lavender” below:\n\nIn other music news, Kodak Black has shared a new music video addressing his numerous run-ins with the law.
