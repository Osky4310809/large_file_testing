Those runner-up finishes put Larson No. 1 in the points standings and it also made him one of only 16 drivers in NASCAR Premier Series history to finish second in at least three consecutive races. \nHere are all 16: RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 16 Herb Thomas, 1952, 1955 \nThomas immortalized The Fabulous Hudson Hornet, winning two championships. In 1952, he posted three straight runner-up finishes at Detroit, Niagara Falls, and Oswego, N.Y. Three years later, he did it at Montgomery, Ala.; Langhorne, Pa.; and Raleigh, N.C. 15 Dick Rathman, 1953 \nIn addition to winning five races in 1953, Rathmann finished second 12 times in 35 races. Three of those came consecutively at High Point, N.C.; Wilson, N.C.; and Rochester, N.Y. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 14 Bob Welborn, 1958 \nWelborn’s second-place streak began at Columbia, S.C., then continued in Nashville and North Carolina’s Asheville-Weaverville Speedway. 13 Richard Petty, 1963, '64, '66, '75 \nPetty won more races than anyone in NASCAR and he had three consecutive runner-up finishes three times in his career. And in 1964, he finished second in four races in a row: Charlotte, Greenville-Pickens Speedway in South Carolina, North Carolina’s Asheville-Weaverville Speedway and Atlanta. Petty then won the next two races after that before finishing second again in the next two. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 12 Dick Hutcherso, 1965, '67 \nHow’s this for obscure? In 1965, Hutcherson drove his Holman-Moody Ford to consecutive runner-up finishes at Manassas, Va.; Old Bridge, N.J.; and Islip, N.Y. Two years later, Hutcherson did it again while driving for Bondy Long, finishing second at Greenville-Pickens Speedway in South Carolina, Daytona and Bristol. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 11 David Pearson, 1969, '77 \nPearson’s first runner-up trifecta in 1969 included Macon, Ga., Maryville, Tenn., and Michigan in a Holman-Moody Ford.

But Stewart took the title on the basis of a tiebreaker for most race victories. 1 Kyle Larson, 2017 \nSo far, it’s been a fabulous season for the Chip Ganassi Racing driver, who in the last three weeks has finished second at Atlanta, Las Vegas and Phoenix.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:22:25.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
