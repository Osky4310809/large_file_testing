Read More T2 Trainspotting stars Danny Boyle and Ewan McGregor admit they feel 'ashamed' about their 10-year-long rift Is this the actor you're looking for? The Star Wars actor is unrecognisable \nUnrecognisable Ewan plays Ray Stussy, a balding and overweight parole officer with a huge chip on his shoulder. \nFans of the handsome star will not be disappointed, as he also portrays Emmit Stussy, Ray's attractive, self-made brother who is described as 'the Parking Lot King of Minnesota'. \nThe sibling rivalry is set to build as jealous Ray blames his older brother for his misfortunes, which will surely culminate in classic Fargo violence. Read More Ewan McGregor silent over Piers Morgan row as Good Morning Britain host boasts ratings high Ray looks shifty as he watches the police chief walk passed \nThe trailer at a diner also features Mary Elizabeth Winstead as drifter Nikki Swango and Carrie Coon as Gloria Burgle, the town's police chief. \nNoah Hawley's series, inspired by the 1996 film of the same name, will be connected to the previous seasons but like always features a new principal cast. \nMcGregor is the latest British actor to join the all-star cast of the show, with Martin Freeman playing calamitous Lester Nygaard in season 1 and Harry Potter star David Thewlis on the bill for the third season as V.M. Vargas. Ewan plays two brothers in the new series, but luckily one in better looking \nSeason 3, which began filming in early 2017 in Calgary, Alberta, where the previous two seasons were also filmed, is set in 2010. \nThis brings the action the closest to the present day, with previous series being set in 2006 and 1979. \nFargo's third season airs in the US on April 19 with a UK air date on Channel 4 to follow.
