Every day you hear of yet another Indian who’s been attacked by some whitey.\n2nd NRI: Yeah, it’s very scary indeed. Who’d have thought it would come to this when we voted for that Trump fellow.\n1st NRI: Too right. We voted for him because we thought he and his followers would go only for Ms: Mexicans and Muslims, neither of which we particularly cared about. Particularly not the latter.\n2nd NRI: Right. But now all these Trump bhakts are attacking us Indians, for no rhyme or reason.\n1st NRI: Yeah, can’t they see we’re not Mexies, and that we most certainly aren’t the other lot of Ms, being shudh shakahari Vaishnavas?\n2nd NRI: Well, you know that these gore log can be pretty dumb at times. In their eyes anyone who’s even slightly darker than them, or in any other way different from them, must be a potential terrorist, or criminal, or some such shady character. To them, we’re all blacks.\n1st NRI: Blacks? Arrey, what are you saying? We Indians aren’t black – we’re Aryans . At least we north Indians are, unlike those people from the south, all of whom we call Madrasis, some of who are so dark they might as well be from Africa. You know? Real kalluas, whom everyone back home makes fun of.\n2nd NRI: Yeah, just as back home we make fun of all those people from the Northeast, calling them ‘Chinky’, and asking them if they eat dogs, and beating them up if they don’t like our jokes about them.\n1st NRI: Yeah, some of those guys can be really thin-skinned. No sense of humour.\n2nd NRI: All this talk about back home is making me homesick. Maybe it’s time we went back to good old Hindustan, which more and more is for us Hindus only.\n1st NRI: Maybe you’re right. Maybe we should go back home. People here are just too darned racist …", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:05:52.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
