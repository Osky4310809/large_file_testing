Before now we were spending N5 billion a day importing rice from Thailand. Now that money is in the hands and pocket of farmers in Kano, Jigawa, Kebbi and other parts of the country. \n“That is why farmers are getting richer; before now, the money was going to some other places and the poverty was coming here, that era is gone,” he noted. \nHe said the figure represents the money being spent on the importation of these farm produce before the ban on food importation and tariff increase by the government. \nChief Ogbe commended Kano State government and the farmers for the rice, wheat and other food programme saying it has expelled recession from the state and supplied food to needy states across the federation. \n“I’m proud of you and thank you for all your effort. I know if we give you the right support as we are trying to do, you can feed the whole nation and there will be no hunger in Nigeria,” he added. \nHe said further production is being encouraged through reduction of price of fertiliser to as low as less than N6,000 per bag by the Federal Government via an arrangenment with the Moroccan government. \nOn herdsmen/farmer clashes and cattle rustling, the minister said grazing reserves are being created across the federation fitted with accommodation, human and veterinary clinics, water, schools among others to stop herdsmen from roaming about, \n“Similarly, the good news is that 3,000 Civil Defense operatives are being trained by the Nigeria army to combat issues of cattle rustling perpetrated on those rearing cattle by hoodlums,” he noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:44:52.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
