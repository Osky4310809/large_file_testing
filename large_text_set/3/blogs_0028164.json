Zach worked with his lyrics; BReal works with His lyrics... The cross over does not work for me... Any more than having Bruce Dickinson sing for Slipknot, or Eric Clapton play for Pantera... 4 How could we forget Chester singing for Stone Temple Pilots? hahaha 0 Put Sambora back to Bon Jovi and do some real rock again! 7 How bout all of Vektor back in Vektor. 6 Its a shame only 1 member is left . Terminal Redux got me interested in thrash metal after years of not investing any time on new thrash records. 0 That 1 member is the sole writer of Terminal Redux. It changes absolutely nothing. Tons of insanely good bands are like this. 0 Sebastian Bach in skid row 3 Peter Criss? He can't even play the drums well. 2 Roger Waters- Pink Floyd. Dead horse officially beaten... 2 But the band doesn't exist anymore. Gilmour and Mason decided to end it, David said 0 I was hoping for Scott Weiland to eventually rejoin STP before he died. 2 I'm a massive Deep Purple fan, and I am very glad that Ritchie left the band. They found new, better life with Steve Morse. Purpendicular is their best album since the 70's, in my opinion. 2 vsdornelas 1,100 · 9 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Not only that, but I also think everyone in DP would feel awkward and unhappy if Blackmore was brought back. I really don't get fans at times. This band found, as you said, new life with Morse, and everyone is enjoying himself on stage. But fans would rather have them be miserable as their favorite line-up. 2 Who the hell wants a guy who can't sing or play guitar properly back in Sepultura? Also I'm pretty sure every one here would sell their mother to see Friedman back in Megadeth. Love Kiko though! 1 Nah, Megadeth is so lame to me. I don't think I care less about another band. Maybe SOAD. 1 Eifler121 160 · 9 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Good list, now I'll list my not-so-famous band members I would like to rejoin their bands: Jukka Nevalainen in Nightwish, Mario García in Dark Moor, Michael Kiske in Helloween, José Andrea in Mägo de Oz, Marty Friedman in Megadeth, and would like to have back The White Strippes and White Zombie 1 Ñoñokiller 336 · 10 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Max and Igor rejoining Sepultura would be a step down for Sepultura at this point. Igor can barely drum these days and Max's already lackluster guitar playing and vocals have degraded to such a level as to be downright embarrassing. Also, Bostaph is and always has been a better drummer than Dave Lombardo and Slayer sound tighter with him behind the kit. 0 As a huge slipknot fan I don't miss joey at all. I think Jay has done a brilliant job, he is a fantastic drummer and hopefully will be there for a long time. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T04:55:54.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
