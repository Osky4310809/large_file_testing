Bournemouth 3-3 Arsenal \n\"What is surprising? We want to win the games, if you don't you're not happy. That is normal,\" he said. \n\"Without passion you do not come back when you are at 70 minutes and 3-0 down. It is exceptional and you need a special response. \n\"We are all frustrated. Of course [Sanchez] is fine.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:26:12.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
