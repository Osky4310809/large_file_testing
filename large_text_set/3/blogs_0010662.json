BJP also wishes that this community should not exist in the country but after the win, BJP speaks on communal harmony and caste feeling all over in the state,” Congress spokesperson Brijesh Kalappa told ANI. \nAccepting his party’s defeat, he said that one must always introspect into the reason for his victory or loss, adding that the Congress is happy with its victory in Punjab. “Congress and Samajwadi Party joined hands for the development of Uttar Pradesh. But the people didn’t accept it and we accept this defeat. We are happy with our victory in other states. \n  \nSometimes even defeat teaches us a lot,” he said. Breaking all previous records, the BJP bagged two-third majority in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The BJP won with a clear majority in Uttarakhand with 57 seats in a 70-member assembly, ousting the Congress led by chief minister Harish Rawat and in Uttar Pradesh, the saffron party saw an unprecedented victory with 321 seats, while the Congress-Samajwadi party alliance bagged 54, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) got 19 and others 18.
