In any case, penises are often of different sizes when limp, but when erect, become a similar size. “Am I good enough in bed?” Why not ask your partner? One woman may find one man brilliant in bed; another woman may find that same man not satisfying at all. Communication is the answer to find out what your partner likes. \nMen: “If I don’t want sex, will she think less of me?” Not if you don’t think less of her when she doesn’t feel like having sex. Contrary to popular belief, men aren’t always ready for sex at any time. Like women, they have to be in the mood. That doesn’t mean to say that, sometimes, it is not kind to have sex with your partner if he or she desperately wants it, even if you are not that keen. \n“My partner never has an orgasm, so, I know I’m bad in bed. What can I do about it?” If she doesn’t seem to mind and says she enjoys sex with you, then don’t worry, it is her problem not yours. And since a lot of women never have an orgasm during sex, it may well not be a problem at all. For heaven’s sake, if she says sex is fine for her, don’t nag her about her lack of orgasm, it will just put pressure on her. \nWomen: “I’ve read that I should never fake an orgasm, but I do sometimes. Is it wrong?” If you fake orgasms constantly and feel frustrated, then it is not wrong. Simply silly. Tell your man what you want and you might get more enjoyment. \n“I only feel like having sex in the middle of the month. Am I odd?” Most women, if they keep a diary, find that they feel sexier at certain times of the month. Some find they feel sexiest at the time just between periods, when they are most fertile; some prefer sex just after a period when they feel relaxed, and others fancy sex just before or even during a period. Work out when you feel sexiest and make sure your partner knows.
