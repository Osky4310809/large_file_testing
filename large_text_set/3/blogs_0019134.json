Although Messi is adored by those in Catalonia for the joy and success he has brought to the Camp Nou down the years, he’s not universally appreciated in Argentina, having failed to steer the team to a major honour. Zamorano, speaking to Super Deportivo (h/t Sacha Pisani of Goal), feels the forward should be cherished by his country: \nIf Messi were Chilean, he would have monuments all over the country and he would be tired of getting tributes. In Chile he is valued. \nArgentinians take into account the differences between Barcelona's Messi and the national team's Messi. In Spain he looks to one side and he has Neymar, looks to the other and he has [Luis] Suarez, looks back and has [Andres] Iniesta and [Sergio] Busquets. \nThat's why, you must look the whole picture. I think the best in the world is valued. We must value the effort Messi makes, because he plays between 70 and 80 games per year and, despite that, he comes to play for the national team. Pier Marco Tacca/Getty Images While the trophies have continued to flow with Barcelona, on the international stage Messi and Argentina have endured a string of heartbreaks. Indeed, for the last three summers the team has fallen to defeat in major finals. In 2014 they lost out to Germany in the FIFA World Cup final, while in 2015 and 2016, they were defeated in back-to-back Copa America finals by Chile in a penalty shootouts. Heartbroken after the loss in the summer, Messi announced he was to retire from the international game, although he has since reversed his decision. Sports journalist Rafael Hernandez believes Argentina haven’t been let down by the Barcelona man in that time but other illustrious names: Rafael Hernández @RafaelH117 Di Maria, Agüero, Higuaín, good were the days of “Messi has a world class squad at Argentina”, penny finally dropped for most people. 3/15/2017, 9:10:42 PM While Messi missed a penalty in last summer’s shootout, he was sensational in helping Argentina secure their spot in the final. In 2015 it was a similar story, while at the 2014 World Cup, the Albiceleste No. 10 was named as the Player of the Tournament. Nevertheless, he has still been criticised by some Argentina supporters who hold him to the highest possible standards. Ole ’s Marcelo Sottile told Jeff Himmelman of the New York Times that there is \"less room for forgiveness\" for Messi in Argentina given he left his homeland at 13 to join up with the Barcelona academy. Messi's Argentina came up just short again in the 2016 Copa America. Mike Stobe/Getty Images It’s a decision that worked out rather well for Messi, though, who has won 28 honours with the Blaugrana and been crowned as the best player on the planet five times. As noted by OptaJose, his consistency in front of goal is ludicrous: OptaJose @OptaJose 40 - Lionel Messi is the only La Liga player to reach 40 goals in each of the last eight seasons in all competitions. Extra-terrestrial. https://t.co/rp8nmC83XV 3/19/2017, 8:34:14 PM Having come so close on so many occasions with Argentina, there’s a sense that Messi may never get that crowning moment on the international stage. The Albiceleste have struggled to devise a setup that not only brings the best out of their star man, but the rest of the excellent attacking players that Edgardo Bauza has to call upon. The 2018 FIFA World Cup will likely be the next opportunity for Messi to seize glory in his country’s colours. Argentina will need to get a move in on qualifying, though, with the team down in fifth position in the CONMEBOL standings; they will take on Chile in a repeat of the summer’s Copa America final on Thursday.
