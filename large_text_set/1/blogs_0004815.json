The public sector insurer is involved in determining whether workers are freelance or not as a provider of compulsory on-the-job accident insurance which is required for certain high risk professions. \nAt the time of writing Uber had not responded to a request for comment but the company’s general manager in the market, Rasoul Jalali, told SRF it intends to appeal. “In Switzerland, courts still have to decide the ultimate verdict,” he said. \nUber’s appeal process might be superseded by the country’s Federal Council which, according to the SRF, is due to submit a report on digital services soon that’s set to make it clear whether new rules will be created for technology service providers. \nUber is also appealing the UK tribunal ruling — despite the latter dubbing its characterization of the relationship between it and its drivers as “a pure fiction”. That ruling sets a precedent for other Uber drivers in the UK to bring employment classification challenges against the ride-hailing platform giant. \nAs well as various challenges at the national level , Uber is also defending its business model in front of Europe’s top court, the ECJ, which is also set to rule this year on whether the tech giant is a transportation service or a digital platform. The case was referred to the court after a legal challenge in Spain. \nAny ruling by the ECJ which deems Uber a transportation provider would have huge ramifications for its business across the region as it would be required to comply with national regulations of the 28 EU Member States. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:06:20.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
