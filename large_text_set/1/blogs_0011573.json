The company has announced it is the first airliner with free WiFi Internet support installed in all of its planes.\nSee also: Best WiFi hotspot devices May 3, 2016 JetBlue says its service, which it runs under the name Fly-Fi, offers peak download speeds of between 12 to 15Mbps, which is much faster than the current Gogo service that’s available on a number of other major US airlines that also usually costs close to $20 per flight. The Fly-Fi service is available on JetBlue flights over the continental US, but is not available with flights that go outside that area.\nIf you are on a domestic JetBlue flight, you can access a curated number of streaming videos from Amazon’s service. If you are a member of Amazon Prime, you can get full access to the service’s selection of classic TV shows and movies, along with its original content, while on the JetBlue flight. You can even order items off off Amazon’s retail site and have it count towards the airline’s own TrueBlue rewards service, where you get three TrueBlue points for every dollar that is spent.\nFinally, JetBlue says it is also the first US airliner to offer its WiFi service “gate-to-gate”. That means you can begin using the service from the time you sit down in your chair until your flight reaches its final gate, without having to wait until the plane reaches its cruising speed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:39:48.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
