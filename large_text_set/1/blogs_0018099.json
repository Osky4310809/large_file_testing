But I don't believe this was suicide,\" he added. Andros Georgiou has decided to speak out (Photo: BBC) \n\"I think his heart just stopped beating.\" \nThe ex-music producer, who fell out with the star in 1998, said he wanted \"to get to the truth of what happened, exactly what was in his blood at the time, who gave it [the drugs] to him, why did he have it again.\" George Michael and 'cousin' Andros during the 1990s (Photo: ALPHA PHOTO PRESS AGENCY LTD.)

Something which remains unexplained. \nIt comes shortly after Georgiou made a public statement in social media, criticising George's boyfriend Fadi Fawaz. \n“I have been trying to hold back on this tweet I saw nearly 10 days ago but the more I am reading and the more I am finding out about Fadi I just can’t keep my mouth shut any longer,” he wrote.

And why did he sleep in the car? Too many questions have come up.” \nFadi has claimed he found George dead in bed at his Oxfordshire home after spending the night sleeping in his car. \nHe later told The Mirror: \"I never saw him that night. The police know everything. That’s the most important thing.” Fans and family alike have been mourning in public (Photo: REUTERS) \nFadi has been questioned by police investigating George's death but there is no suggestion he's done anything wrong. \nHe said recently the police had been very supportive and kind towards him, claiming: \"They have done what normally happens when someone dies. \n\"They have not been accusing me, never; they have been very supportive.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T02:51:05.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
