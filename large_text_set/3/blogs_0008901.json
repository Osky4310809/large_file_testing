Jenna Anderson Back to Article Image of \nSpoilers for tonight's episode of The Flash. \nTonight's episode of The Flash gave the team another lengthy exchange with the season's Big Bad, Savitar. While speaking through Julian Albert (Tom Felton), the god of speed revealed some details about where exactly he is currently being held. And while those details were relatively vague, they were enough to get our team theorizing. \nSavitar explained that he is currently imprisoned in the future, in such a way that caused him to 'lose his mind several times over.' While its unclear what exactly Savitar's identity is, that piece of information does link him to another iconic Flash villain - Abra Kadabra ( Ant-Man and The Dark Knight 's David Dastmalchian). \nKadabra, who was officially cast on the show just yesterday, is described by The CW as \"a criminal from a distant future whose advanced technological powers seem like magic.\" According to the official press release, the time traveler \"holds a secret the Flash will stop at nothing to uncover.\" \nThis leads to the question - could Abra Kadabra be Savitar himself? Given bits and pieces of his comic backstory, that could possibly be where this season is heading. \nIn his initial debut in 1962's The Flash #133 , Kadabra - known as Citizen Abra - was a resident of the 64th century, who was thrown in jail after an altercation with Flash. While Kadabra's main motivation was to become a popular stage magician, his ultimate goal was to be adored by people - something the 'godly' Savitar appears to share. The metahuman grew to have a nature of turning people into his 'puppets' - a skill Savitar has shown throughout this season. \nAnd Kadabra's most recent comic book appearance - in DC Rebirth's version of Titans , is particularly telling as well. As was recently revealed, Kadabra has quite a grudge with Wally West, causing him to disappear into the speed force (all of which was shown between Wally and Savitar in tonight's episode). In addition, Kadabra has connections to the universe-shattering events of the DC Universe: Rebirth special. \nWhile, at this point, any indication of Kadabra being Savitar is just speculation, there are certainly enough similarities in place for the theory to be on our radar. \nCould Kadabra really be the God of Speed? Or do you have a different theory? Let us know in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:10:30.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
