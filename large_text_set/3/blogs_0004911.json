Why go up in the first place?” Hayden added. Shaun Marsh LBW call should have been reviewed 1:23 \nCricket: Shaun Marsh LBW call should have been reviewed. March 7th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Cricket/Australian Internationals/ Shaun Marsh LBW call should have been reviewed \nAustralia’s anger was compounded when Shaun Marsh was given out lbw shortly after, despite the ball hitting well outside off stump when not playing a shot. \nWith one review burned by Warner, Marsh opted not to review and potentially leave Australia with no reviews for the remainder of Australia’s innings. \nBut replays showed that the ball would’ve missed off stump quite comfortably.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T11:06:37.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
