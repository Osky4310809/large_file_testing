Not the police department in Kyoto, Japan, that’s for sure.\nThey’ve started utilizing what they call the Yosokugata Hanzai Bogyo (Predictive Crime Defense) System. Unlike Philip K. Dick’s sci-fi creation, this system is 100% real and far less fantastical in terms of how it works.\nThe System isn’t actually telling police who’s going to commit a crime and where or when they’ll do it a la Minority Report . It’s sort of like how Major League Baseball teams analyze spray charts for hitters to set up their defensive alignments on the diamond.\nThe System is basically a powerful computer that runs calculations based on historical crime data for the area. It looks for trends in that data, issues a report, and police can then adjust their patrols so that officers are in the right places at the right times.\nAccording to Rocket News 24 , the System is currently tuned for a limited number of offenses such as assaults and vehicle thefts. The next step in its deployment is to expand the coverage area. They want to take it nationwide as soon as possible.\nThere are concerns that the System may lead to a rise in false arrests, but that’ll but up to Japan’s men and women in blue. They’ll need to remind themselves that the Predictive Crime Defense System isn’t really predicting crimes. It’s just helping make sure that patrols are set up for maximum crime fighting efficiency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T10:24:05.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
