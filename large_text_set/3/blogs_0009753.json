He recently said Merkel was “by far the most important European leader,” but called her decision to open the door to a million migrants in 2015 a “catastrophic mistake.” \n“I think she made one very catastrophic mistake, and that was taking all of these illegals,” Trump said in a January interview with The Sunday Times and German tabloid Bild. “And nobody even knows where they come from. So I think she made a catastrophic mistake, very bad mistake.” \nMerkel was one of former President Barack Obama’s closest allies. She has dodged questions on Trump in the past but said she wants to “exchange ideas with respect” after Trump’s inauguration in January.
