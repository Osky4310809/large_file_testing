Aisha Gani / Via BuzzFeed News ID: 10757842 Iwona described the woman he lived with there as being in her thirties and said she wore “Islamic clothing”. The neighbour said she hadn’t seen Masood for a few months and that he just “took a van and went”. Then, 10 days ago, the woman and child followed. “The family moved quickly and took their things out of the garage,” Iwona said.\nAnother neighbour, who gave her name as Sam, said: “He moved out in December and I never really spoke to him. I didn’t know his name before.\n“He had a little boy who was 5 years old. There was a woman – I didn’t know if it was his wife or daughter. We’d just say hello in the street.”\nIt is assumed by police that he was acting on extreme Islamist ideology. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday.\nView this image ›\nThe block of flats where Masood lived most recently, in Quayside, a cul-de-sac in Birmingham. Aisha Gani / Via BuzzFeed News\nID: 10757866 Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday morning, prime minister Theresa May confirmed that Masood was known to the security services but said “he was not part of the current intelligence picture” and that “there was no prior intelligence of his intent to attack the capital”.\nA former intelligence official told BuzzFeed News: “The service had him as an SOI [subject of interest] a few years ago but think he didn’t meet the threshold for investigation so was not investigated further.”\nThey added: “My sense is this was pre-ISIL but the increased sophistication online and in messaging has awakened or re-radicalised him and then he’s acted as a lone wolf or perhaps as part of a small circle of extremists but with a very small, neat invisible footprint.”\nThe Metropolitan police initially held back from confirming his identity while the investigation was underway. Eight arrests have been made following raids on six properties in Birmingham and London.\nMasood began Wednesday’s attack by driving a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing two people and injuring dozens, before crashing into parliament. He was shot and killed shortly after fatally stabbing police officer Keith Palmer, who was on duty at the gate.\nView this image ›\nStefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images\nID: 10755702", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:06:16.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
