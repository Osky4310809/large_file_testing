(Photo: Copyright unknown) Share Get   Thank you for subscribing!   \nGigi Hadid has posted a sweet message to her other half Zayn Malik as he celebrates his 24th birthday. \nThe Victoria's Secret beauty shared a brooding black and white snap of the former One Direction star overlooking a cloudy skyline. \n\"Happy birthday my handsome,\" she wrote, \"So lucky to know and love a soul like yours wishing you the best year ever!!!\" https://www.instagram.com/p/BPLFcIhj70N/?taken-by=gigihadid&hl=en/embed \nGigi's post came a few hours after Liam Payne also took to social media to wish Zayn happy birthday. \nTaking to Twitter on Thursday evening, Liam sent Directioners into a frenzy as he wrote: \"@zaynmalik Happy birthday bro! Hope all is well and you have a good day celebrating it (sic)\" \nNot surprisingly, fans immediately responded with a wave of love for the gesture, with many hinting they were crying tears of joy. \nZayn previously insisted he had rarely spoken to the rest of One Direction - which includes Liam, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan - since he quit the group in March 2015, so perhaps it is no surprise his other ex-bandmates haven't reached out to him on Twitter on his special day. Gigi Hadid Zayn Malik (Photo: Copyright unknown) \nHe previously said: \"The truth is I haven't spoken to any of the boys at all really, I spoke to Liam a bit and that's just the way it is. \n\"I did try to reach out to a couple of people and they didn't get back to me, but then publicly, when they were asked questions about it, said that they'd spoken to me and that we were friends. \n\"But that's not the case, I tried to reach out and be their friend but they haven't even replied to any of my calls or texts.\" Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid attend the Givenchy show as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2017 on October 2, 2016 in Paris, France (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Recording artists Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik of One Direction (Photo: Getty Images) \nHowever, the It's You star recently reached out to Louis following the tragic death of his beloved mother Johannah Deakin, who died of cancer last month. \nHe tweeted: \"@Louis_Tomlinson love you bro! All of your family is in my prayers. proud of your strength and know your mum is too x (sic).\" \nAnd a source later added: \"Zayn has been in touch with Louis privately, and will continue to offer his support that way.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T01:17:59.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
