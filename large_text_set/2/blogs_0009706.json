That’s the case for most of the country’s biggest players, who begin their Test series against India less than 24 hours after the final T20I on Thursday. \nThe schedule clash also means the side will be coached by Justin Langer and assistant coaches Ricky Ponting and Jason Gillespie, with Darren Lehmann and his support staff already in India. \n“You ever heard of the ‘Who Cares Cup?’ This is the ‘Who Cares Cup’,” Clark, who played all three formats for Australia, said on Fox Sports News 500’s Bill and Boz show. “We’re not even playing our best team. They’re all in India, having a game of Test cricket.” Stuart Clark: Ever heard of the ‘Who Cares Cup?’ Source: Getty Images \nClark believes that aside from World Twenty20 tournaments, T20 cricket should only be played at the domestic level. \n“I’d get rid of them for good; there’d be no more T20 internationals other than a World Cup every four years. \n“No one cares (about T20Is) because everyone always rests their players. We do it every year.” \nThe schedule clash has also left players frustrated. \nLast month David Warner told foxsports.com.au he was unimpressed by the cluttered international calendar, which has robbed him of a chance to prepare for the next World T20, scheduled to take place in Australia in 2020 – although there is a strong push to squeeze another edition of the tournament in 2018. \n“It is very, very poor scheduling,” Warner said. “To have your Test team going away to play a Test match and one-dayers overseas, it doesn’t make any sense to us. \n“Those of us who are part of the T20 team have a bigger goal and bigger picture, and that is to win a World Cup. You want to be putting your best team on the park all the time. \n“At the end of the day, you’ve got Big Bash and IPL. If me, Smithy (Steve Smith), Starcy (Mitchell Starc), Uzzie (Usman Khawaja), Shaun Marsh — all these guys that are in the Australian T20 team from the previous World Cup — if we are not playing any T20 cricket in Australia where the next World Cup is meant to be, it becomes quite a tough thing for selectors to work around.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:16:45.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
