Yes, some of us may still dream of a happy, fairytale ending (and there's nothing wrong with that), but as we've grown up, we've come to some pretty harsh realisations about our favourite female â€˜role models'. And while a part of our hearts was broken by these new truths, it also made us realise just how stupid, and anti-feminist some of these stories were. There are still a few Disney princesses we can stand to learn a few things from, and here they are. Breakthrough the shackles of gender roles and societal pressures, like Mulan \nMulan proves that women can do everything that men can, without any help, and, most times, even better. The woman saves the whole of China, all on her own, and essentially kicks a lot of butt for all the right reasons. Passion, a love for adventure, and fearlessness from Moana \nMoana was one of the few Disney films that focused on no love interest (YES!), and has a teenage protagonist who voyages across the ocean to save her people. As you can imagine, that's a LOT of pressure, but Moana fearlessly takes up the mission, finds herself and her strength along the way, doesn't let failure get to her, and basically just does what she loves. Embrace who you are, like Elsa, and be brave like Anna \nWhile, unfortunately, Elsa was forced to leave her home because nobody understood or accepted her, she made the extremely brave decision to be on her own and live while being true to herself. And when she did come back, she was stronger than ever, and could openly be herself without having to hide anything. \nHer sister, Anna, on the other hand, braved everything that came in her way, for her one true love - her sister. While there was a romantic angle in her story, it happened while she was on the mission to reunite with her sister. Courage, strength, and heroism from Merida \nMerida breaks through gender stereotypes, refuses to give in to the concept of an arranged marriage, fights for her freedom, and her most important relationship is that with her parents. She broke through the stereotypical mould of a Disney princess, and we love it. Determination, a strong will, and independence from Tiana \nAlthough her love interest was a frog, Tiana was one of the most independent, strong-willed princesses ever. She worked hard, and used her resourcefulness and talent to achieve her dream of opening her own restaurant at the end of the film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T08:40:16.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
