Well, Leicester City remind me of him. \nNot individually. In that respect, they’re ­hard-working pros who have earned their corn. \nAnd, as far as I know, none of them have blown their wad on racetracks in their back gardens. \nBut, collectively, the similarity is very much there, in that they look as if they have been dropped into a situation, a life, that is completely alien to them. \nJust as Carroll didn’t know how to handle his fortune, Leicester don’t seem to know how to handle being champions. 'Lotto Lout' Mickey Carroll blew all his cash and has been jailed twice since 2002 (Photo: The People) \nI’ll bet they went away in the summer not knowing what to do with their achievement and wondering, ‘Are we really champions of England? Is it a blip? Is it a miracle? Or are we really actually that good?’ \nThe truth is, their triumph last season was an anomaly. \nBut new contracts, book projects and movies were all added to the mix on the back of the title-winning campaign and no wonder it has caused most, if not all, of them to take their eyes off the ball. \nThe interesting thing about Leicester’s struggles this season is that they are giving us a potted football psychology lesson in 12 months. Claudio Ranieri looks dejected during Leicester's defeat by Manchester United (Photo: REUTERS) \nThis time last year, we kept hearing interviews in which Foxes stars said, “We’re a band of brothers, the dressing-room spirit is almost super-human”. \nAnd the season culminated at Jamie Vardy’s house, where they were all there together, celebrating what they had done. I wonder how many times they have all been round to Vardy’s house this season. \nOr how many times he has sat down with the group and said, “You know what, fellas, I need to stop being involved in this film, this book. \nLeicester 3-1 Derby: best pictures from FA Cup fourth round replay View gallery \n“I need to just get my head down and score some goals because that’s my job, that’s what this team needs from me and I’m on a massive contract here now.” \nHow many times have Robert Huth and Wes Morgan, who defended like lions last season, said to each other, “We put our bodies on the line last season and we’re just not doing it as much – that has to change”? \nAnd I could be as scathing of Riyad Mahrez as I like, but he is only replicating this worrying trend of having a big season, then being awful the next season and not really caring because he’s been there and done that. Wes Morgan and Robert Huth look like different players this season (Photo: Reuters) Riyad Mahrez has also gone off the boil (Photo: REUTERS) \nIt looks like Leicester’s player have all got a little bit fat, a little bit giddy on becoming the latest Miracle Men. \nFrom a player’s perspective, I can understand there might have been a little tail-off, but top six, top eight should have been easy. \nHowever, to find themselves in a relegation scrap is incredible and the one thing with the Premier League is that it grinds you down, week in, week out, if you’re not careful. \nIt will sniff blood and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Swansea didn’t win comfortably on Sunday to heap even more misery on Claudio Ranieri and his men. Ranieri has taken much of the blame for his side's demise (Photo: Gareth Copley) \nNo doubt that would lead to more stories of dressing-room unrest, of players questioning their manager, yet I bet he is saying nothing he didn’t say last season. \nHe is being made a scapegoat for what’s happening and, sadly, people rely on perceptions. \nLast season, he was the Roman emperor, planting his sword in the ground after being the nearly man. \nThis season, he is almost being parodied again, The Tinkerman nickname raising its head, with people whispering, “Oh, here he is again, the idiot we thought was coming to Leicester in the first place”. His players should have the experience to stay up comfortably (Photo: Plumb Images) \nNo. It’s the players who are the problem. \nThey need to say, “Gaffer, let’s get back to 4-4-2, to Schmeichel, Simpson, Huth, Morgan, Fuchs, Mahrez, Mendy, Drinkwater, Albrighton, Okazaki and Vardy and, as players, let’s say the next 14 games are even more important than the last 14 games last season’. \nThey have players who know how to win League One, the Championship, the Premier League and how to stay up in the Premier League, so they are very experienced in ­high-pressure situations. \nAnd if they can get their mindset right, they will stay up – with ease. poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:25:04.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
