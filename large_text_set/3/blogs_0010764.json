Bono and the former president entered first and Michelle followed behind.\nExcited guests were “hooting and howling” as they exited the restaurant, and we’re told Barack Obama “flashed his million-dollar smile” as he waved to the crowd.\nBarack Obama has ventured to New York a few times since leaving office. In February, he and daughter Malia saw “The Price” on Broadway while she’s interning for movie-business bigwig Harvey Weinstein.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:17:23.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
