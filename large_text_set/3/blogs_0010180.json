Former contestants from the ABC franchise, including Viall‚Äôs sometime rival Josh Murray , reacted to the news that he proposed to Vanessa Grimaldi during the season 21 finale on Monday, March 13. Bachelor Us Weekly Covers Josh Murray and Chris Soules Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage; Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images; \n‚ÄúI wish them luck,‚Äù Murray, 32, exclusively told Us Weekly at the Bachelor Season Finale Viewing Party at Hollywood Park Casino. ‚ÄúHopefully they stay away and try to focus on themselves and not the outside world, because the outside world can really ruin people's relationships if you focus on it too much. Focus on each other. Don't focus on all the other mess and all the negativity that happens and then things could work out.‚Äù \nMurray and Viall haven‚Äôt always seen eye-to-eye. Both men competed for Andi Dorfman‚Äôs affections on season 10 of The Bachelorette in 2014; Viall was the runner-up while the former baseball player proposed to Dorfman. The pair called off their five-month engagement in January 2015. Murray and Viall butted heads again in season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise. Nick and Vanessa on the Bachelor ABC/Terhi Tuovinen Best Celebrity Proposal Stories Ever! \n‚ÄúIf people have two different agendas at the end of the day too, which may be the case, then there's no way that it can work out anyway,‚Äù Murray added to Us. ‚ÄúI don't know what his agenda is. I think people will see. I mean, what is his next gig? Dancing With the Stars ? So I mean, I'm sure there will be a lot after that as well.‚Äù (Viall, 36, is partnered with Peta Murgatroyd on the upcoming season 24 of DWTS .) Season 19 Bachelor Chris Soules , for his part, was elated to hear that Viall chose Grimaldi, 29. ‚ÄúI just got little goosebumps,‚Äù he said at the event. ‚ÄúVanessa was my pick‚Ä¶ He had some hesitation there the last couple of weeks [over] whether he was gonna pick anybody, but I was pretty confident [that] he decided to go through with picking somebody or getting engaged. I knew that was gonna be his pick.‚Äù Andi Dorfman's Yearbook Photos \nRobby Hayes , however, was rooting for Viall‚Äôs runner-up, Raven Gates . Hayes, 28, who just scored a modeling contract, placed second in JoJo Fletcher‚Äôs season 12 of The Bachelorette last year. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big Raven fan. I'm from Georgia and the accent kinda gets me ‚Äî pulls at my strings,‚Äù he told Us . ‚ÄúBut I wish him the best. Nick needs to find that love. He's 36. He's been on a few seasons. Find that love and settle down and get off the show and start a family.‚Äù A post shared by Jen Saviano (@jensav11) on Mar 13, 2017 at 4:34pm PDT \nJen Saviano , meanwhile, took to Instagram on Monday night with some vague words of wisdom. She and Viall hooked up on season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise and split before he was announced as the next Bachelor. Though she didn‚Äôt specifically allude to Viall or his new fiancee, she posted a message that read: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always one decision away from a totally different life.‚Äù She added in her caption, ‚ÄúTrue that. Stay positive, choose wisely.‚Äù \nOther Bachelor Nation folks who gave their two cents included former Bachelorette and newly married Ali Fedotowsky , former Bachelor Sean Lowe , season 1 Bachelorette Trista Sutter and more. \nRead more reactions below: ‚Äî Ali Fedotowsky-Manno (@AliFedotowsky) March 14, 2017 #bachelorinparadise just got better!
