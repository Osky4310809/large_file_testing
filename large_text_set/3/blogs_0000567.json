The live audience, predictably, went a little nuts at the mere mention of Winfrey’s name in connection (even hypothetically) to the White House. For her part, Winfrey, who has been in the TV business for nearly 40 years, paused for dramatic effect.\n“I never considered the question even a possibility,” she said, before adding, “I just thought, ‘Oh … oh?'”\nWithout mentioning President Donald Trump’s name, Rubenstein then pointed out that “it’s clear you don’t need government experience to be elected president of the United States.”\n“That’s what I thought,” Winfrey said. “I thought, ‘Oh gee, I don’t have the experience, I don’t know enough.’ And now I’m thinking, ‘Oh.'”\nCarolyn Kaster / Associated Press Oprah Winfrey speaks at the Let Freedom Ring ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2013 Could that be a possible campaign slogan in 2020? “Oh!” Stranger things have happened.\nIn the last presidential election Winfrey threw her considerable muscle behind former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, after initially planning to stay out of politics for a while.\n“Regardless of your politics, it’s a seminal moment for women. What this says is, there is no ceiling, that ceiling just went boom! It says anything is possible when you can be leader of the free world,” Winfrey told “Entertainment Tonight” in a June 2016 interview. But as Rubenstein pointed out, that ceiling, though cracked, is still intact when it comes to the highest political office in the country.\nreliable-source\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:59:30.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
