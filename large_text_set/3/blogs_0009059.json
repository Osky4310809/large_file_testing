Right from the stay in the hospital to medical tests to delivery costs and medicines, a well-constructed plan with maternity option can help ease off the rising costs so that one can enjoy the happiest moment of one’s life without taking any stress of heavy financial burden. \n“We are at increasing risk of becoming victim to lifestyle diseases primarily due to late working hours, bad eating habits, no exercise and high levels of stress. As women nowadays substantially contribute in managing the financial liabilities, it is equally important to have a safeguard for their medical emergencies,” says Dhruv Sarin- Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com. \nHere are some reasons why women should go for health insurance: \nMaternity Benefit Women should opt for a plan which is covering maternity benefit. Under this benefit, it includes expenses for hospitalization and the cost of delivery of the baby irrespective of a normal or a caesarean delivery. The cover also includes the pre and post hospitalization care. Other things included are free ambulance charges, medicines, post hospitalization baby care service, etc. \n“If you are planning to have a child in a few years, then you should consider buying a plan with maternity benefit or a maternity add-on benefit. Maternity benefit covers expenses related to normal and caesarean delivery after certain waiting periods which may vary according to a plan from 9 months – 4 years,” says Sarin. \nYou may also watch: \nNo hospitalization charges While taking a health insurance you can avail cashless services from the listed hospital in your insurance policy. It simply means that you do not have to pay the medical expenses while visiting these hospitals. In case of an emergency even tough you are falling short of cash, your health insurance policy will not let you get out of your pocket. \n“Women take a heavy toll to balance between personal and professional life. Typically, after the age of 40 women are more vulnerable to health issues and have a greater probability of falling prey to critical illness such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes etc. The treatment can cost in lakhs, leaving a huge burden on your pocket,” says Sarin. \nTax benefit Working women can easily avail the tax benefit under section 80D of the Income Tax Act. A maximum deduction of Rs 25000 can be availed against paying health insurance premiums every year. \nTop-up’ s available Suppose you got married, you got dependents or whatsoever the case may be, an easy top up to your health insurance can provide you a larger cover. \nDespite taking a new health insurance you should go for a top-up plan because it enhances your health insurance cover by paying a lesser amount when compared to buying a new policy. The best part is that opting for a top up plan does not require medical screening tests. \nOther benefits Some of the allied benefits which can be availed through a health insurance policy are free OPD services, free health check-ups, free consultation with doctors, and other healthcare services. \n“It is necessary for women to have a health insurance plan in place as much as men do, basically to have a financial backup and to cover the expenses of any unexpected medical emergency,” says Sarin. \nYou may also watch: \nThe five best maternity coverage plans are mentioned below: \n(Source Policybazaar.com)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:19:35.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
