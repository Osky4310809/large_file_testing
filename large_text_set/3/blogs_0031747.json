We reach out to our mom and our friends, we pick up magazines and read blogs. And then there's always good ol' Reddit . But sometimes you need to ask advice on beauty products or skin-care that doesn't feel like speaking into an echo chamber. Enter: Beauty Talk, Sephora's online community of people from all over the world that come together and help each other find the product that's worth their hard-earned money. Racked discovered Beauty Talk, and found that it's home to more than a million posts and replies, which makes it even more wild that it's stayed a relative secret — until now. As Racked points out, it's not easy to find Beauty Talk. I had trouble myself. Unless you know the actual website, you have to click through what feels like a million web pages to find it. Once I did find it, it was sort of like stumbling onto Reddit, but with less trolls. Like Reddit, there are different threads on a variety of topics. I was most interested in digging into Adult Acne , where I found solace in the fact that even women in their 30s get period pimples . There's also The Highlight Challenge thread, where I marveled at all the gorgeous photos of all different users showing off their best glow. In short, I've been a beauty editor for seven years and I still learned a thing or two in just a few minutes. Beauty Talk users take the community seriously, as evident by the thoughtful advice they give their virtual friends. This is probably because they know that said friend will pick up the product recommended. A 24-year-old woman going by the pseudonym Olivia , told Racked that she does \"take the reviews very seriously.\" She adds: \"I just bought blush online without trying it because the Ladies of Sephora told me it was good. It actually wasn't a good blush for me, but I don't blame them for that.\" Olivia describes herself as a \"feminine, mostly straight young woman at the State Department\" working in a \"conservative, male-dominated institution.\" It makes total sense Beauty Talk would be her space to do what one does best with the Internet — find her own community and place where she can be herself.
