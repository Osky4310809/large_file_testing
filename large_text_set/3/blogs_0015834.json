Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTwo parents were traumatised when an electric blanket caught fire as their seven-year-old girl lay reading in bed. \nLittle Bethany Anderson shouted that she could \"hear and smell party poppers\" when her terrified mum and dad ran in and found \"smoke and sparks flying everywhere\". \nBut the couple, who had the 'fright of their life' are disappointed by the reaction from manufacturer Morphy Richards, who had given them no resolution four months down the line, \nQuick-thinking mum Lynsey Anderson grabbed the seven-year-old and got her to safety while husband Mark stopped the fire from spreading. \nMark, 35, told the Sunday Mail's The Judge column : “I’m appalled and angry at the way we’re being treated. There was a plume of smoke and sparks flying everywhere. The seven-year-old was under a Morphy Richards blanket \n“And this from a blanket which is advertised as having an overheat system and cut-off switch. \n“If we hadn’t been there, the whole room could have gone up.” \nMark, an assistant manager with a glazing firm, had switched on the blanket as Bethany lay on his bed with her iPad on November 10.

Then the smell became more intense so I pulled back the duvet and saw electrical sparks. \n“The bed was smouldering and burning and I could hear frazzling noises.” \nMark, of Larkhall, Lanarkshire, pulled the plug from the wall and managed to extinguish the fire. \nBut the bed was ruined as the blanket had burned two holes in the mattress. \nLynsey, 35, also mum to 18-month-old Harry, contacted Morphy Richards the next day.
