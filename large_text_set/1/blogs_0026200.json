Baylor officials said 17 women reported rapes committed by 19 players, including four gang rapes, since 2011.\nThe woman, who is suing Baylor for Title IX violations, claims she was gang raped by football players Tre’Von Armstead and Shamycheal Chatman following a campus party in 2013. She says Chatman was previously accused of rape by a student athletic trainer, but instead of punishing him the university offered to reassign the victim to a female athletic team if she would keep the incident under wraps.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Baylor football promoted a “show ’em a good time” culture and “used sex to sell” the school to recruits.\nFormer assistant coach Kendall Briles allegedly asked a high school recruit, “Do you like white women? Because we have a lot of them at Baylor and they love football players.” Briles is the son of head coach Art Briles — who was fired by Baylor last year amid mounting evidence of a rape culure around the football team — and recently was hired as offensive coordinator by Lane Kiffin at Florida Atlantic.\nThe most recent allegations come after former university president Ken Starr, also deposed in the fallout from the scandal, told the Wall Street Journal in December he personally “doubts that there were gang rapes.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:12:44.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
