Former AG Patrick Connolly \nMacarthur had brutally murdered nurse Bridie Gargan when stealing her car in the Phoenix Park, then lured Donal Dunne to his death some days later on the pretext of buying a shotgun from him, which he then used to kill the Co Offaly farmer. \nAccording to Mr Connolly's will, which was filed in the Probate Office in Dublin last week, Macarthur's former partner, Brenda Little, has been left €100,000 in cash and Mr Connolly's interest in an apartment on Sallymount Ave, Ranelagh, Dublin. Two-bed apartments in that area command prices of more than €300,000. \nMs Little's son with Macarthur, Colin Little, who became a close friend of Mr Connolly, was left €75,000 in cash and Mr Connolly's \"collection of cigarette trade cards and pictures\". \nPatrick Connolly, of Carnsore, Pilot View, Dalkey, Co Dublin, who died on January 7, 2016, left estate valued at €3,318,897. Killer Malcolm Macarthur pictured during his trial \nDespite returning to practise at the Bar, Mr Connolly was always remembered for the events surrounding the capture of Macarthur on August 13, 1982, after a nine-day manhunt. \nDuring that time, he had brought the killer to the All-Ireland final as his guest and the fugitive had shaken hands with then Garda Commissioner Patrick McLaughlin during the half-time interval. \nThe trial of Macarthur in January 1983 was extremely short and equally controversial, as he pleaded guilty to the murder of Ms Gargan, but charges of murdering Mr Dunne were dropped. \nWhen the prosecution offered to outline the facts of the case, the trial judge said this was not necessary and the entire proceedings were over in an estimated seven minutes. A closeup of Macarthur \nMr Connolly was called to the Bar in 1949 and built up a lucrative commercial practice. He never married but was very close to his extended family. \nHe never spoke about the dramatic events of 1982, but his funeral Mass in Dalkey was told that he kept a meticulous diary throughout his life. \nMacarthur was released from prison in September 2012 and lives in south Co Dublin. \nAccording to his will, Mr Connolly left bequests of €10,000 to the Bar Benevolent Council, Concern, and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. He also left €2,000 to the priest in Dalkey for Masses to be said for his soul. Connolly’s funeral.
