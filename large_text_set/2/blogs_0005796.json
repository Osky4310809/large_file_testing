For now, at least, two once-overlooked pieces of West Dallas' estimable history will not be vaporized. They've been given a reprieve — two years, and the clock has begun ticking. Still, better than nothing. \n\"Relieved,\" said Albert Gonzalez, the co-founder, eight years ago, of the Dallas Mexican American Historical League. Which is as far as he'd take it. Not thrilled; not ecstatic. For now, only relieved. The battle is won; the war, far from over. A rush to landmark Bonnie Parker's old school, lest the remains of Cement City turn to dust \nOn Monday afternoon Dallas' Landmark Commission voted to begin the process of turning two primordial West Dallas structures into official landmarks: a 127-year-old Victorian farmhouse that once belonged to saloon owner and German immigrant Heinrich Struck; and the nearly century-old Eagle Ford School, which once educated the kids, most of them Mexican, whose parents had come to Dallas to work for the Trinity Portland Cement Co. The votes, taken separately, were unanimous — despite the opposition from the properties' owners and potential buyers who are vehemently against designation. \nLet's be clear about this, though, so there is no confusion: The house and school are not landmarks. Far from. The old Eagle Ford School on Chalk Hill Road. (Robert Wilonsky/Staff writer) \nThe vote to initiate designation is merely a two-year time-out while members of the Landmark Commission and the property owners work to figure out a way to save the structures. They will develop preservation criteria; they will assemble a plan; they will determine if the structures are even viable enough to spare. Initiation does not always lead to designation, which would act as a force field keeping the wrecking balls and excavators at bay. \nBut what happened Monday was significant nonetheless, yet another signal that the once reactive Landmark Commission will no longer stand for the vanishing of Dallas' history without putting up a fight. Landmark used to be loathe to initiate designation over the objections of owners. How times have changed: Its chair Katherine Seale brought the Struck farmhouse to the commission; commissioner Michael Amonett put the Eagle Ford School on the agenda. In West Dallas, the struggle to save a neighborhood — and one of city's oldest homes \n\"We've lost a lot of gems,\" said commissioner Mattia Flabiano, appointed by North Dallas' Lee Kleinman. \"I am glad to be part of a commission that helps saves them for our kids and grandkids.\" \nIf the commission hadn't acted Monday, the Struck house and Eagle Ford School could have been vanished without warning and without penalty. And both are imperiled: David Weekley Homes wants to vanish the Struck manse on North Edgefield Avenue and Stafford Street to build town homes, over the objections of neighbors loathe to see their rustic neighborhood near the city's auto pound drowned by developers. And the owner of a cell tower behind the Eagle Ford School wants to raze the structure to plant more towers. A 127-year-old West Dallas house needs to be moved, or it will be destroyed \nSpeakers lined up to make their cases for both buildings — preservationists, folks who grew up in the Western Heights neighborhood, where the Struck house is, men and women who'd attended Eagle Ford School. They noted how few landmarks there are in West Dallas, and how poorly the the city has acknowledged the Hispanics who, according to census records unearthed by the Dallas Mexican American Historical League, settled the city as early as 1850. \n\"We cannot bring history back,\" said Eladio Martinez, speaking on behalf of Eagle Ford. \"If we can save it from being demolished, we have accomplished something.\" \nAnd so they have — for two years, at least. Which isn't forever. Not yet. But a relief, at least.
