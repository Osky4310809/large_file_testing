She not only carried their baby, but let Jimi and Antoine stay with her family just ahead of Nathaniel’s birth. \nNathaniel arrived on New Year’s Day, at 7 pounds and 9 ounces. He was the first baby of 2017 born at Delnor Hospital in Geneva. \nHis birth came much faster than the Goninans had expected. \nJimi said he and Antoine left the delivery room while doctors gave Tara an epidural, but Nathaniel arrived before they had a chance to administer it. \nJimi said they plan to stay in touch with Tara and their egg donor, a woman from California; and have already been sharing pictures. \nIf all goes well, down the road Jimi and Antoine would like Tara to carry another embryo they had created – this time using Antoine’s sperm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:37:58.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
