He has a bright future, and Green and Gold runs through his veins. We are in good hands in the future, we are also extremely fortunate. goldrush36 says: Jan 19, 2017 12:36 PM \nSmart move by Green Bay. niners816 says: Jan 19, 2017 12:37 PM \nHe was never going to San Fran. He was never going anywhere. He did this so he could put the Packers on the hot seat and give him the money and job that he wants. He is taking over for Thompson. Great move by Wolf. Green Bay will have a GM that will spend money on free agents and won’t be tight with money. jonwill57 says: Jan 19, 2017 12:38 PM \nWhat the heck…I’ll do it. I will be happy to work with Kyle, as long as his dad doesn’t come around. codytha035 says: Jan 19, 2017 12:38 PM \nof course he’d rather stay with the greatest organization in pro sports and not a dumpster fire like SF. tho SF proly has more upside than MN binkystevens says: Jan 19, 2017 12:39 PM \nSounds like he dropped out because Packers gave him a new deal, not because he wasn’t going to get the other one. He’s hanging around the hoop for the most coveted GM role out there: the Packers. Even if Green Bay is not a bustling metropolis, just think of the luxury of having full control of football operations without a meddlesome owner and a die hard fan base. a1b24312 says: Jan 19, 2017 12:41 PM \nHe wasn’t able to pick the coach in SF. Smart move by him. He stays in a very stable NFL organization. streetyson says: Jan 19, 2017 12:46 PM \nHey Darin, if he didn’t stand a real chance @49ers then why did the Pack tempt him with a raise? Simple fact is most guys would rather not work for the mess that Jed made if they can. Jan 19, 2017 12:49 PM \nGood news for 49ers fans. \nAnyone named “Eliot Wolf” is bound to be a total hack. factschecker says: Jan 19, 2017 12:50 PM \nPay attention Atlanta. Now that you got your new stadium, you might be next? SF was awesome, top to bottom until they got their stadium built. joetoronto says: Jan 19, 2017 12:56 PM \nLeft at the alter like an unwanted bride, the Santa Clara 49ers. afreshperspective2017 says: Jan 19, 2017 1:02 PM \nThe 9ers should just punt and hire Shanahan’s dad as GM. If it works, it’s great. If not, what’s new? At least you know they come from the same football philosophies. cheeseisfattening says: Jan 19, 2017 1:05 PM \nIs it even possible to pull out of something that you have just been turned down? \nWhatever, I am just so glad his nepotistic incompetence is returning to Green Bay. And knowing anywhere else he interviews will see right through that. Jan 19, 2017 1:06 PM \nMight as well ride Rodgers coat tails for a few more years. Easy money. harrisonhits2 says: Jan 19, 2017 1:13 PM \nThere’s a real stench coming from the 9ers facility. Jan 19, 2017 1:13 PM \n@joesaskatchewan \nYou would be the most qualified person to know that feeling here since your team moves cities every 20yrs 4sacroc says: Jan 19, 2017 1:14 PM \nNo one commenting here knows anything about what will become of Eliot Wolf. \nAll we know is he is Ron Wolf’s son. PFTknowit says: Jan 19, 2017 1:15 PM \nThe timing could be brutal for Wolf when he takes over for Thompson. Thompson will hang on until Rodgers is done, then Wolf will be stuck with the QB who follows the legend that followed the legend. Or maybe that QB will be better than both Rodgers and Favre…lol. Jan 19, 2017 1:33 PM \nSmart move by Eliot. Usually the GM picks the HC, not the other way around. jimmysee says: Jan 19, 2017 1:42 PM \nToo much monkey business going on with the ‘Niners. \nEliot is too smart to accept that job without control over the roster and hiring the coach. realfootballfan says: Jan 19, 2017 1:43 PM \nThe Packers’ roster isn’t exactly helping his cause. Just because his father was good means nothing. See Chris Polian. skyflyer63 says: Jan 19, 2017 1:49 PM \nCalled it when the owner hired the head coach on his own… Eliot is smart enough to see the smoke of the 9er dumpster fire all the way in Green Bay… I really think behind the scenes he has been told he is the heir to Teds empire. Jan 19, 2017 1:53 PM \nSF shoulda thrown in a lifetime supply of crab cioppino. Sweeten the deal. immafubared says: Jan 19, 2017 2:11 PM \nTime for Teddy boy to step down. This guy aint sitting on the sideline much longer. maybe he knows something? whenwilliteverend says: Jan 19, 2017 2:17 PM \nFrom everything I have read so far, the GM job in SF is not going to be that great of a deal since they are supposedly going to give Shanahan final say in personnel matters. If that’s the case, why bother with a GM. I’m surprised Mr. Silverspoon (Jed Clampett York) doesn’t just forget about the GM so he can save money. Jan 19, 2017 2:54 PM \nNo one commenting here knows anything about what will become of Eliot Wolf. === \nWrong. \nAny Packer fan worth his salt knows The Young Wolf is a virtual lock to become GM in Green Bay once Ted Thompson decides to step away. thegreatgabbert says: Jan 19, 2017 2:56 PM \nCasting call continues for the part of Gomer Pyle’s sidekick straight man for the upcoming season.
