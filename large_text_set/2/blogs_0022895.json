The great thing for Makers, though, is that many of the devices from one’s childhood (or before) can now be driven with inexpensive tools such as Arduinos . Some of them, like the 1982-vintage MicroVox model that Elkins got his hands on, even include a manual with schematics and components listed. \nAfter going over his new find and the enclosed manual, the video really hits a highlight around 13:45, when he powers it on to hear it burp out “ready” in a deep monotonous tone that may bring back memories of the robotic future you remember fondly. He finally hooks up the Uno just after that, and gets it to spit out an “interesting” catch phrase just after 16:30. \nYou can read more about the project on Hackaday and see other projects by Elkins on his YouTube channel here!
