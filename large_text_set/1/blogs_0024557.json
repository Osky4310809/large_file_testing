Like, a crap ton of abs. Whatever is the most amount of abs you can have, Maryniak has more. Second, the New York-based personal trainer has a killer back story: After he placed first in a CrossFit competition, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes—but that didn’t stop him from pursuing his love for fitness. Maryniak regularly mixes things up on Instagram with kickboxing, gymnastics, strength training, cardio, and especially ab work, which brings us to the last thing. In this video, Maryniak hangs from a pullup bar and doesn’t just smoke his abs while performing a variety of tough medicine ball moves—he incinerates them, blows them to smithereens, and leaves no witnesses. Wait until the end when he kicks the med-ball over the pullup bar, and spins around to catch it in his feet on the other side. Most humans cannot do this.
