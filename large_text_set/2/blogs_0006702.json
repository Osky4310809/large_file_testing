We are very much aware of the saying that everyone in the world has a doppelgänger, but this woman looks so much like T. Swift it’s eerie. Meet April Gloria, a cosplayer from Kansas who may or may not be a clone of the blonde pop sensation. (We want some scientific proof before we say that this is merely a coincidence.)\nGloria’s expertise about costumes and makeup should explain how she pulls off a perfect Taylor Swift. But the photos below show Gloria out of costume. Prepare to be amazed.\nIs this 911? We’d like to report possible identity theft. I got a ring light so I, too, can have white rings around my pupils I'm slowly collecting things to make an amateurish photo studio in my house \nA photo posted by April (@april_gloria) on Jan 19, 2017 at 2:15pm PST \nThe hair, the signature red lip and cat-eye liner combo, and even Gloria’s facial features have an uncanny resemblance to Swift’s. What is this MADNESS?\nRed lips and rosy cheeks Since I went all out makeup wise (considering it was a shoot and all), here's what I put on my face. They are all among my holy grail products: - @smashboxcosmetics primer water and pore filling primer - @katvondbeauty high voltage eye primer - @revlon colorstay foundation applied w beauty blender. Shade 180 - @itcosmetics brightening concealer in medium under eyes and on spots - @urbandecaycosmetics naked skin concealer under eyes - @anastasiabeverlyhills brow wiz in taupe - @wetnwildbeauty contour palette - @espionage_cosmetics shadow in Sakura as blush - @beccacosmetics highlight in moonstone - @espionage_cosmetics shadows on eyes in Karei, Sudden But Inevitable, and Vault Hunter - @katvondbeauty tattoo liner pen - @eyelure_lashes number 126 lashes cut in half - @maccosmetics lip liner in cherry - @urbandecaycosmetics lipstick in Bad Blood #aprilgloriacosplay #april #makeup #redlips #redlipclassic #badblood #taylorswift #taylorswiftlookalike #doppelganger #christmas #fairylights #christmaslights #christmastree #espionagecosmetics #nerdmakeupambassador #nerdmakeupec #fornerdsbynerds \nA photo posted by April (@april_gloria) on Dec 12, 2016 at 6:05pm PST \nOne theory we have is that April Gloria is in fact Taylor Swift. Via Instagram, the singer is pulling a huge prank on the world by making us think that she has an unrelated twin sister. Clever, Swift. Very clever.\nLip-urban decay Troublemaker, the Christmas limited shade Eyes- @espionage_cosmetics shadows in Karei, Sudden But Inevitable and Vault Hunter Cheeks- @espionage_cosmetics shadow in Sakura #espionagecosmetics #nerdmakeupec #awesomeisacolor #fall #autumn #fallmakeup #berrylip #nerdmakeupambassador #berry #lipstick #urbandecay #vicelipstick \nA photo posted by April (@april_gloria) on Nov 30, 2016 at 2:09pm PST \nOr perhaps this is proof that aliens exist. Perhaps one alien, upon touchdown to Earth, made the egregious error of taking the form of world-famous Taylor Swift rather than the form of a nobody off the street!\nLove this little guy ❤️ Loki is the baby of the family and is always down for a nap #cats #catsofinstagram #siamesemix #lynxpoint \nA photo posted by April (@april_gloria) on Oct 17, 2016 at 8:18pm PDT \nOur minds are spinning trying to figure how, when, why, where. I've been playing around with some of @espionage_cosmetics eye shadow pigments and I have to say the black shade Vault Hunter is awesome. Very pigmented and blends nicely. I love a smoky cat eye so this shade was perfect for the outer corners. I'm a messy person though so there was a little bit of cleanup on the counter top LOL I'm also wearing Epic on the lid and Quest Reward on the crease. I'm excited to try some of the crazy bright colors! #espionagecosmetics #nerdmakeupambassador #nerdmakeupEC #fornerdsbynerds #awesomeisacolor \nA photo posted by April (@april_gloria) on Aug 22, 2016 at 1:26pm PDT \nAnd clearly, we are not alone. Instagram / april_gloria Instagram / april_gloria Instagram / april_gloria Just like the answer to the age-old question, “How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?” the world may never know the truth about this doppelgänger mystery. Kudos to April Gloria for not only throwing Instagram into a tailspin, but also for being blessed with the beauty of Taylor Swift.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:29:11.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
