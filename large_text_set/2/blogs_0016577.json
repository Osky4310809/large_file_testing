When I took her to Gentle Healer they did the x-ray and told me she needed surgery right away or she would die me being scared I said ok to save my best friend they took her back a gave me a bill I had told them I don't have that much on my care credit card so they then started to deducting things on the list to do the procedure right off the list so at this time it was over the $1,100 on my card I then owed $54 my total bill was printed out, when I got back to pick up Sugar up my bill had jump to $194. They then told me and my husband that they fond nothing wrong with her and that they was sorry they did the procedure, I then went in the next day for her fallow up and her legs was crisscrossing and she looked to be coming paralyzed they told me it would take up to 2 weeks for her to walk that it was normal she then said no I would give it a month at this time she the doctor apologized that they did this again. The very next day Sugar was paralyzed I then took her back to WVRC to see why Sugar was not walking I was so so sad they then told me that it could be something on her spin and it would cost me another $3,000 for a MAR and another $5,000 for another surgery not guaranteed she would walk after that they told me it would be best to put her down the hardest thing ever for me. This is my store of my best friend Sugar I had a Biopsy done it was been since the 28th of January it is now the 21st of February and still ne results to the Biopsy sent to me it cost me another $500 to find the true reason for my dogs death.
