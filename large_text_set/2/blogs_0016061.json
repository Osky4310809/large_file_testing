Now who’s ready for recess?” \nThe eighth grade drama teacher came under fire when one 13-year-old student came home and asked his mother if she had anything he could use to make a tourniquet (“Reee-lax Mom, it’s for school!”). The teacher also told the students to “act scared” when making the crystal meth and “happy” when injecting it. 3 \nThe mother was not impressed by the teacher’s ambitious theatrical production. \n“I’m reading this thing and my eyes are just swelling as I’m reading it and I think my blood pressure went up by about 50 points because it is detailed, step-by-step, blueprint instructions on what you need to make crystal meth, how to prepare the crystal meth and then how to inject yourself with crystal meth.” \nSome people just don’t appreciate the arts. \nI, for one, would love to see my kid act this out. I don’t have any kids, but I can imagine that after a decade of watching little Billy sit there as Rock #2 in Hamlet , it would be a nice change of pace to see him go full-on Requiem for a Dream , flopping around on the ground like a fish out of water while that crazy drama teacher shouts “ROLL THOSE EYES BACK, BILLY! MORE THRASHING!” from offstage. But like I said, I’m more artistically inclined than most people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:36:13.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
