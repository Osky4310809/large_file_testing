Mums and dads grabbed their frightened children and hid after the jungle big cat went on the run at Port Lympne wildlife park. \nKent Live reports that visitors were shut in shops for their own safety at the attraction - which hit the headlines when Peter Andre took his family out there last year. The savage five foot long slavering beast was on the loose for nearly half an hour before it was tempted back into its pen by lumps of meat tossed into its enclosure. Visitors were escorted to 'safe areas' and no-one had been in danger - a park spokesman later insisted. Cheetah's are the world's fastest animal, and can spring at 75mph - almost three times as quick as Usain Bolt. \nOne mum, 38-year-old Maggie Jones, of Maidstone, who was visiting the park with husband Gary, 39, and their children Danielle, 11, and Harry, 13, said \"It was pretty scary. \n\"Word quickly spread that a big cat was on the loose and parents were shooing their children into the shops and even into the toilets. \"Everyone was looking round nervously in case it was about to jump out on us. \"They reassured us it was harmless but none of the mums and dads were taking any chances. \"Apparently it got out of its enclosure and was on the loose where they take safari buses full of people.\" The safari park says the cheetah was keen to get back in its enclosure (Photo: Google) \nPort Lympne animal director Adrian Harland said \"This particular cheetah was no real threat to our guests. \"He only climbed out to get back with his mother after having been separated to stop him eating all her dinner. \"The cheetah was calm and pacing the enclosure fence looking to get back in. \"Some food was thrown into the enclosure and the cheetah walked back in to get it. No vet intervention was needed. \"The full escape procedure was run because the safari lorries travel past the enclosure. \n\"We have secured the enclosures perimeter fencing to ensure that the cheetah cannot climb out again.\" The cheetah was tempted back in with lumps of meat (file pic) (Photo: Moment RF) \nAnother visitor, Alice Snape, took to Twitter to say her group had hid in a toilet during the incident. She tweeted 'Alice Snape @MoreWhiteQueen Locked in the loos as a cheetah on the loose OMG @portlympnepark #cheetahontheloose.' \nThere were also other reports on social media that visitors were placed in the tapir enclosure and the park's gift shop. Port Lympne, spread over 600 acres near Hythe, Kent, says it is 'home to the UK's most authentic safari experience, The African Experience - 100 acres alive with African animals. \n\"Join our safari vehicles to see animals including zebras and giraffes wandering freely then head off on foot around the rest of the park to see the big cats and primates.
