Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2016\nIn the suit, Jacobus claims the tweets prompted online hate from Trump's followers, which included \"demeaning, sometimes sexually charged, comments and graphics, including insults aimed at her professional conduct\" and her experience and qualifications. Another tweet was an image of a “grossly disfigured face, and a depiction of (Jacobus) in a gas chamber with Trump standing nearby ready to push a button marked 'Gas.'\"\nTrump's tweets came after Jacobus said she was asked to interview for a campaign communications director position in May 2015 before Trump announced his candidacy.
