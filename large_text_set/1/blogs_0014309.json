Advertisement - story continues below \nHow would today’s New York Times have described the attack on Pearl Harbor? \nThe Gray Lady has been solidly in the Democrat column for generations, and openly despises President-elect Donald Trump, but a Times editorial board account of the Chicago Facebook torture case stretched the bounds of “journalism” even in the BuzzFeed age. \nIt was propaganda aimed at the future — a future where news and views, facts and feelings — comingle with little regard for the distinction.

Four black hoodlums, two men and two women, allegedly abducted a mentally disabled young white man and tortured him in a savage session they streamed live on Facebook. \nIn the process, the attackers shouted “F*** Donald Trump” and “F*** white people,” just to make it clear who was being tortured and why. Besides felonies like aggravated kidnapping and aggravated battery, they face charges of committing a hate crime, meaning the motivation behind the barbarism was at least partly the victim’s white skin. \nYou’d never know that from reading The Times ’ abbreviated description, though. Advertisement - story continues below \nIn an editorial this week titled “This Week in Hate” (part of a continuing series), The Times described the attack like this: \n“Four people have been charged with a hate crime, among other charges, in the beating in Chicago of a teenager with mental disabilities, which was broadcast on Facebook Live on January 3. The video shows one of the suspects shouting about Donald Trump and ‘white people.’” \nTechnically, the description is true, but some crucial nouns and adjectives are missing that would make the circumstances a lot clearer. \nChanging “Four people” to “four black people” would be a start – if the suspects had been white, it’s a rock-solid bet that would have been noted. Instead of the ambiguous “shouting about Donald Trump and white people,” slipping the word “obscenity” in there would have given the reader a good idea exactly what happened.

(Note: In other “This Week in Hate” entries, victims who were Muslims or Jews were clearly identified as such.) \nThere’s no way of knowing exactly what was going on in the great minds of Manhattan, of course, but it’s hard to believe deliberate deception was not the intent, the only question is, who was intended to be deceived? \nThis isn’t the first instance of misleading or ambiguous wording in a report by a major news organization about the horrific Chicago torture crime. As Mediaite pointed out in a Jan. 7 article about a CBS Radio News report, the network “…falsely implied that the victim was black and his attackers were white, when in fact the opposite was true.” \nAnyone with a radio, television, newspaper, or internet access in January 2017 knows full well that the Chicago savages (suspects) are black and that the victim in the case was white. But what will an internet search turn up in 2022 or ’32 turn up? \nThat early in the Trump administration, four people shouting something about the president elect and Caucasians in general attacked a special needs teenager for reasons unknown? \nClearly, the future reader will infer that it was the Trump campaign and presidency that provided the context for the attack, and from there, a leap to blaming Trump and his supporters isn’t crossing a bridge too far. \nThe Times news coverage of the story has been clear about the race of the suspects and the victim so it’s not like the entire story is being twisted beyond recognition. But just enough doubt, just enough ambiguity is being sown now to bear fruit in the future – painting the current racial tensions racking the country as emanating from a man who’s not even in the White House yet (as opposed to the president who’s been there for eight years). \nIn the telling of The Times editors today, the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor might have been as “violence broke out between the naval forces of the United States and the Empire of Japan.” \nAbraham Lincoln would have “gotten himself shot” at Ford’s Theater in 1865. A mob shouting something about “taxes” would have attacked a British ship carrying tea in Boston Harbor in 1773, for reasons unexplained. \nContext means everything, and The Times editors know it.
