PUBLISHED: 22:30, Thu, Jan 5, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:35, Thu, Jan 5, 2017 \nBut last night the Black Cats told West Ham that their key player was not for sale at any price. The Hammers had a £6m offer for the 34 year old striker rejected on Wednesday but went back in immediately with a new bid. \nSunderland , whose owner Elliot Short is ready to sell the club, do not want to sell their best player, who has scored 11 goals this season and 33 in 74 games overall. \nBut Hammers manager Slaven Bilic, whose side face Manchester City in the FA Cup third round tonight but who desperately need more firepower, has made Defoe his No1 striking target. GETTY West Ham are upping their efforts to bring Jermain Defoe back GETTY Jermain Defoe began his professional career at West Ham \nBilic has also made enquiries about Celtic’s former Fulham striker Moussa Dembele – but the Scottish club value him at £40m, despite only signing him for a £500,000 compensation fee in the summer. \nWest Ham also had a £10m bid for Brentford hit man Scott Hogan turned down on Wednesday. On Defoe, Bilic said: “He has the most important thing in the game: goals. He converts most of chances to goals. \n“The whole club is trying really hard to get some players in positions that we need. Last season Defoe was probably the main reason Sunderland stayed up and he has continued to play the same way this season. Each game he is not only scoring goals but creating chances and most of the chances he’s converting into goals. He is an excellent player.” GETTY West Ham also had an offer for Scott Hogan rebuffed Best free agents still available for the January transfer window Sun, December 25, 2016 Click through the gallery to reveal some of the best ex-Premier League free agents available in the January transfer window GETTY 1 of 15 Click through the gallery for the best free agents still available ahead of the January transfer window \nDefoe joined Sunderland in an £8m deal from MLS club Toronto in 2014 but West Ham have been told that the player is keen to return to the club. \nHe was picked up as a 16 year old from Charlton’s academy by West Ham and went on to a score 41 goals for the club in 105 appearances before controversially leaving for Tottenham in 2004.
