Interesting word choice, given Nancy Kerrigan’s history, but it’s all good.

Telling Nancy Kerrigan to “break a leg” when she was clubbed in the goddamned leg by a man named Shane Stant at the behest of one Jeff Gilooly before the 1994 Olympics seems in poor taste at the minimum. But, Kristi’s reps say that she meant no harm. \nThey’ve been friends since they were 15, per Kristi’s people, and they even hopped on the phone to share a giggle about the controversy which turned out to be nothing at all. \nAdvertisement \n\n[ TMZ ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:17:36.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
