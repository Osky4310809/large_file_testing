In addition, the 48-year-old is also being charged with aggravated identity theft, which carries a minimum sentence of two years behind bars. \n\"From half a world away, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly targeted multinational internet companies and tricked their agents and employees into wiring over $100 million to overseas bank accounts under his control,\" Acting US Attorney Joon H. Kim said. \"This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies -- even the most sophisticated -- that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals.\" \n\"We thank the companies and their banks for acting quickly, coming forward promptly, and cooperating with law enforcement; it led not only to the charges announced today, but also the recovery of much of the stolen funds,\" Kim added. \nThe prosecution comes from the DoJ's Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:01:33.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
