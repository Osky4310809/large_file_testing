I’ll never forget a panel I shared with Michael Cunningham a decade ago, a weekend that was very influential for me in realizing New Orleans is home. I’m equally honored to be talking with Justin Torres and Matthew Griffin this year, both writers who share staggering talent.” \nThe Saints and Sinner LGBT Literary Festival goes from March 24 to March 26.
