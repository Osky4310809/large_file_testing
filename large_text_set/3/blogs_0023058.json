It’s not good enough.” \nMarshall, who was thrown a $100,000 lifeline by the Broncos after departing the Dragons, was a regular panellist on the television program last year.

Source: News Corp Australia \nHis link to the show only fuelled speculation he leaked in-house information to a journalist about Milford. \nWhile Bennett didn’t refer to Marshall by name, he revealed there was a confrontation prior to training today. \n“I confronted the player this morning who allegedly made a comment (about Milford), and he never made that comment and he never made the comment. The journalist made it up,” Bennett said. \nBen Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover examine Jason Taylor’s sacking at the Wests Tigers and how it impacts the club and its roster going forward. \nYou can also subscribe via iTunes or for Android users, listen on the iPP Podcast Player app. \n“To be quite candid with you, I’m kind of over a lot of things and a lot of issues that are happening right now in our game. \n“On the Anthony Milford issue this morning, I needed to talk to that player. I had to make sure that comment hadn’t been made or why it was made. \n“But the player assured me, and I believe that player, that he never spoke to the journalist and he never gave him that information.” \nBacking Milford’s work ethic, the coach stressed there is no issue with the 22-year-old. Milf, Broncos close to deal 0:51 \nHaving claimed Kent’s comments were nothing but farcical, Bennett then took aim at the media as a whole. \n“Anthony has a good work ethic,” Bennett said. \n“We don’t have a problem with Anthony Milford in any form, shape or manner. \n“We’ve lost the change room, I’ve lost my aura ... it’s just all rubbish you guys are making up and it’s getting ridiculous. It’s offensive actually in the end. \n“There are things that happen in a workplace, there is in-house stuff that should stay in there and we are no different at the Broncos. We have that right to have that. \n“Anthony doesn’t have a poor work ethic. He trains. You guys are here, you see him out here with everybody, he doesn’t take shortcuts, he doesn’t miss anything. \n“I’m quick to jump on this because I’m over where we are going with all this stuff.” \nThis is the latest in a string of dramas out of Red Hill regarding leaked information. \nOnly last year Josh McGuire was accused of leaking team information to the media which resulted in a picture of a rat stuck to his locker. \nLive stream the NRL premiership on FOX SPORTS.
