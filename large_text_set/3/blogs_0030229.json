Larry Nassar during a recent court appearance. NBC News \nProsecutors took no position on the defense motion, which was granted with some modifications by Ingham County Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina. \n\"I do not want opinions to be cemented in people's minds before there's evidence,\" Aquilina said. \"We need a fair and impartial jury and I'm not sure how we're going to get one if this continues.\" \nThe order — which bars parties from talking about material not already in the court record — technically applies to a single case against Nassar in which he's charged with molesting a family friend. But since it applies to all potential witnesses, its impact is broader. \nAmong the restrictions: Nassar must be publicly referred to by his name or as \"the defendant\" — a clear reaction to a press conference in which state Attorney General Bill Schuette called the doctor \"a monster.\" \nAquilina's crackdown comes a day after Congressional testimony by two elite gymnasts who say they were abused by Nassar, who was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and had a practice at Michigan State University before being fired by both institutions.
