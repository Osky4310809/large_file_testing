Zane Lowe (left) and Elton John Courtesy Beats 1 \n“[Having children] makes all the difference because it’s about them not you,” said the musician. “And it’s the greatest thing you’ll ever know.” \nHe continued, “People say, ‘Well, I disagree I don’t want children’ and that’s fine, I would have said the same thing, until I had them. Then it was like ‘Wow this is it? Are you kidding me?’ If I was 15 years younger, I’d have two or three more. Without question.” A post shared by David Furnish (@davidfurnish) on Oct 26, 2016 at 2:28pm PDT \nFROM COINAGE: What Is The Grammy Bounce? (No, It’s Not A Dance Move) \nOn Saturday, John will celebrate his birthday – and he’s honestly looking forward to it. “Some people don’t like birthdays, they don’t like celebrating, they don’t want to know about them, and I’ve always enjoyed mine birthday,” he said. \n“Seventy sounds so archaic doesn’t it,” John told Lowe. “When I was growing up, 70 sounded like the end of the world. But things have changed, you’re only as old as you feel inside.” \nThough John admitted that sometimes, his physical strength is down, he said, “My inner self I feel great.” \nAnd John’s certain to be in good spirits this weekend: he’s celebrating in style, with a bash that’s been mostly kept “secret” from the star. \n“I just know that it’s a celebration of my 70th and the 50 years of partnership with [collaborator Bernie Taupin] and myself,” he told Lowe. “It’s a great year this year, it’s the 25th anniversary of the AIDS foundation, 50 years of Bernie and me, and 70 years of me. It’s nice to celebrate things. Life is fabulous.” \nAll proceeds from the bash will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and the Hammond Museum, John said.
