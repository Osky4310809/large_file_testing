As a teenager in the ’80s, he left a Muslim household in Massachusetts and sought refuge in the Funkadelic sounds of Oakland, California. He quickly taught himself to play guitar and even landed a multi-million dollar deal with Interscope, but left the label when he felt his identity was “lost” in the process. \nHis trials wouldn’t end there. After a car crash, Dphrepaulezz was in a coma for three weeks and lost the ability to play guitar. It was a time for him to find peace. He moved back to Oakland, bought a farm and raised a family. Now, he’s regained some usage of his hand and is making bluesy music again as Fantastic Negrito . Last year, he released his self-titled debut EP under the moniker; on July 24th, it’s being reissued as a deluxe edition with a handful of bonus material via Blackball Universe. \nOne of the additional tracks, “Lost in a Crowd”, may sound familiar to fans. Earlier this year, the song was dubbed the first-ever NPR Tiny Desk Concert contest winner . This final studio version packs even more venom than the Tiny Desk performance, with the guitar a resounding force and the drums pounding with crushing weight. Dphrepaulezz’s voice is impassioned, somewhere between a croon and a scream. It’s a commanding song, making the listener feel every massive beat. \nListen in below. \nPre-orders for the deluxe reissue are ongoing. In support, Fantastic Negrito will be hitting the road this summer. \nFantastic Negrito 2015 Tour Dates: 06/25 – North Adams, MA @ DownStreet Art Festival 07/23 – Washington, DC @ Rock & Roll Hotel 07/25 – New York, NY @ SummerStage, Central Park 07/27 – Allston, MA @ Brighton Music Hall 07/29 – Louisville, KY @ WFPK Waterfront Wednesdays 07/31 – Chattanooga, TN @ Nightfall Concert Series, Miller Plaza 08/01 – Nashville, TN @ The High Watt 08/06 – San Francisco, CA @ The Chapel 08/08 – San Francisco, CA @ Outside Lands \nAlso, revisit his performance of “Lost in a Crowd” at this year’s SXSW Utopia Sessions: Artists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T09:37:17.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
