The veteran actress won the Best Supporting Actress prize for her magnificent performance in Fences . The skill of her performance in the August Wilson adaptation, for which she also won a Best Actress in a Play Tony Award in 2010, is hard to deny. Davis’ win has been more or less locked up for months at this point, and few would argue with this win. It’s a well-deserved award that is more than deserved, despite some slight category fraud required for her to win the trophy with ease.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:49:48.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
