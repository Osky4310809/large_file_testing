Words such as “chairman” and “mankind” are discouraged , and students are asked to say “chair” and “humanity” in their place. \nStudents are asked to refrain from using other “derogatory” or “ offensive ” words about those with disabilities, women, people of color and almost every group of people imaginable.   \nFor example, students should say “historically underrepresented groups” or “people of color” instead of “minorities.” The reason, according to the guideline? “People of color are actually the majority in many large U.S. cities.” \n“Community members should avoid using language that is insensitive to cultural differences or that excludes or offends any group of people (based on their ability/disability, age, ethnicity and race, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation, etc.),” the statement read. \nStudents must determine “whether it is appropriate to (their) communication to share a particular fact about a person (pertaining to social identity, e.g., age, ethnicity).” \nHow many more words in the English language will be deemed offensive before people realize it’s gone too far? While Americans should respect their neighbors and treat others who are different with the same courtesy they would want for themselves, this guideline seems to drive more of a wedge between people than to unify them.
