In fact, one of Drew Barrymore’s daughters had meltdowns in two Disney parks , and it’s basically all of us after a hard work week.\nOn Thursday, Barrymore visited the Late Night With Seth Meyers show and talked all about her daughters and their adventures to Disney World/Disneyland…and their disasters.\nOkay, they weren’t full-on disasters, but her oldest daughter, Olive did have tantrums and we feel for her.\nWhile discussing her recent trip to Disney World in Florida, Barrymore revealed that her youngest daughter , Frankie, who is two-years-old, can’t wait to go back.\n#people I love these are the loves of my life. #myolive #myfrankie all I wanted to do this week was reflect. Think about people and moments that make life make sense to me. That make life amazing. That motivate me to be my best self. I feel so lucky. And after just living the last few days in all things positive, it was good for me to reflect on things that truly make me happy. \nA photo posted by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Nov 20, 2016 at 4:48pm PST \nWhile Frankie had a blast, her older sister had a few issues at the park and we feel SO connected to her.\n“If you’ve ever taken your kid to Disneyland or Disney World, it all ends at some point in mayhem,” Barrymore told the show’s host , Seth Meyers.\nThe Santa Clarita Diet actress then pulled up a photo of Olive, her oldest, throwing a fit to prove her point.\n“That is a legitimate picture of my daughter just losing it on the floor,” she said. “In this case, she wanted to chase a duck or an egret — it was Florida, so some interesting bird. Maybe a Disney employee, maybe not — maybe wild. But Olive was determined to catch it.”\nYouTube Disney World wasn’t the only place the actress’s five-year-old daughter lost it, she also threw a tantrum in Disneyland.\n“This is her losing it at Disneyland — because it all ends up there,” Barrymore said about the second photo. “You push it enough, because you’re like, ‘I’m here! Let’s skip the nap! Let’s go, go, go!’ You want to maximize it. This is how it always ends for me.” Both of these photos are clearly what we feel like after too many meetings and no sleep. Plus, who hasn’t wound up exhausted after a day at Disneyland? There’s so much to do in so little time.\nBarrymore also pointed out that children’s tantrums “come at the most interesting times.”\nYes! This happened. Thank you @waltdisneyworld for making dreams come true. My daughters were on a cloud. A big puffy princess cloud. #heaven #proudtobeagirl \nA photo posted by Drew Barrymore (@drewbarrymore) on Jan 17, 2017 at 2:31pm PST \n“You cannot predict [when they will be]. I think you should have 10 consistent tools in your arsenal,” she explained. “It’s either the tender loving approach or the ‘I’m very serious’ approach.”\nMeyers joked, “I like your approach which is, ‘A photo op.'” LOL.\nWe’ll take a Disneyland trip with the 41-year-old actress any day…even if it ends up with us on the floor.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:05:04.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
