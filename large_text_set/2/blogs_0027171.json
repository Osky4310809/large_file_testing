Ferne McCann finds her dream date on Celebs Go Dating (Photo: E4) \nBut things quickly turned sour when the Essex babe learnt he had another occupation – as a stripper. \n“Are you f g joking?” she said. \nThen speaking to the camera, she insisted: “I don’t want to go out with a stripper.” But things didn't go to plan (Photo: E4) \nWill then proceeded to describe in detail how he stripped completely naked to entertain punters. \nHe admitted: “I handcuff, I blindfold and gag girls and hang them off the stage.” \nBut while Ferne looked completely horrified – she did decide to give him a chance. \n“He was my man, he excited me,” she told Nadia Essex. “I’m buzzing about my date with Will.” Will was a stripper (Photo: E4) \nThe pair met for cocktails but they didn’t completely see eye to eye. \nAnd then Will dropped the real bombshell – he’d already gone on a date with Jorgie Porter. \n“I can’t believe I’m getting Jorgie’s sloppy seconds,” Ferne complained. \nAnd she left the date early – so she’s still looking for love. \n* Celebs Go Dating continues weeknights at 10pm on E4.
