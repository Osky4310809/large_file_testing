I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.” \nSen. Patrick J. Leahy also asked about Russia during Sessions’s confirmation hearings, the Post reports. \nAdvertisement \n\n“Several of the President-elect’s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?” Leahy wrote.\nSessions responded with one word: “No.”\nNow it seem that Sessions did indeed have communications with the Russians, despite what he said under oath. The Post reports that Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak had a quiet chat in his office in September, “at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U.S. presidential race.” \nWorrisome to say the least, as this is the same sort of funny business that led to Micheal Flynn’s resignation and many in Washington have been asking for Sessions to recuse himself from any further investigations into Russian involvement in the election. Sessions has repeatedly refused to do so up until a few days ago, when he told reporters “I would recuse myself on anything that I should recuse myself on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T05:53:52.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
