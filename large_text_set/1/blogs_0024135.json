But much more than the previous adaptation of Handler’s books—a film version from 2004, starring Jim Carrey, which lightened the tone of the books almost beyond recognition—the series embraces its source material’s dark, more violent fictional world. The story is, on the one hand, as Sonnenfeld has put it, about how “all children are capable and all adults are horrible.” But, more than that, it’s about resisting the impulse to reassure young viewers that everything will be O.K. In an era of “fake news”—of the proliferation of stories we should know better than to believe—“A Series” provides a welcome, if unsettling, indictment of those who are programmed to shield themselves from difficult truths and fall back, instead, on comforting lies.\nSee the rest of the story at newyorker.com \nRelated:\nEverything I Learned from Mary Tyler Moore \nPostscript: Mary Tyler Moore \nThe N.F.L.’s Year of Ratings Politics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:32:36.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
