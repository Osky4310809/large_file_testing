These latest pics show the SUV’s side profile under a drape and zooms in on the car’s headlamps. They come after a single image from last week previewing the front end. \nThe XC60 has been around in current form since 2008. It has been popular, but a replacement is needed. Volvo has said that it will reveal the second-gen XC60 and all-new XC40 SUVs this year , to join the handsome new XC90 . \nFrom what we can see so far, the new XC60 will follow the design template set by its bigger brother, which is no bad thing. All the signature cues are present, including the ‘Thor hammer’ LED daytime running lights, a large rectangular grille and rear vertical LED lamps that trace the angle of the tailgate, which is very Volvo. Click to enlarge \nExpect a larger footprint and a longer wheelbase from Volvo’s midsize SUV, which like the XC90, will sit on the firm’s new Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform. \nShould the cabin of the new XC60 also follow the style of the XC90 – large central screen with AC vents as wings, high centre console – it will bring fresh style into a segment that includes the new Audi Q5 , Mercedes-Benz GLC and the soon to be replaced BMW X3 . \nVolvo’s downsizing push mean that the largest petrol and diesel engines will be 2.0 litre turbos. There could be a T5 three-cylinder hybrid system, too. Stay tuned.
