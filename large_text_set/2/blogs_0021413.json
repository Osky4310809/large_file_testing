Maybe your first introduction to the online art community was a particularly tasteful nude drawing of a cartoon character, or maybe it was… Well, actually, that was probably it. \nAnyway, DeviantArt just sold for $36 million. \nThe site was sold to Wix, a Tel Aviv-based website creation tool, Reuters reported . $36 million is a fair amount of money—not big kid money at a time when startups easily nab hundreds of millions of dollars from investors, but still a shocking amount to anybody who is familiar with DeviantArt as a home for anime fanart and pregnant Sonic the Hedgehog porn fantasies. (In the site's defense, it also hosts a diverse array of art spanning many genres and mediums.) \nThe move makes some sense when you consider how long DeviantArt has been around and how consistently popular it's been for a particular subculture of artists. The site was founded in Los Angeles in 2000, and nearly two decades later boasts 38 million members . Quantcast traffic numbers show that while it's just shy of being in the top 100 most-visited US sites, DeviantArt is still pretty damn popular. \nAs for what the value proposition of horny cartoon nudes might be for Wix, according to Bloomberg , the company hopes that the acquisition will improve its 2017 revenue by $8 million. DeviantArt runs ads on its site, and it seems like it's got a fair amount of eyeballs on them. \nYou know, when those eyeballs aren't staring at a pink pony's ass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:02:28.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
