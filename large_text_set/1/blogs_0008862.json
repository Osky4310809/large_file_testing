Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 \n“FAKE NEWS – A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT,” the president-elect wrote. Though he didn’t say what story he was referring to, the timing — and the fact that the story dominated social media late Tuesday — left little doubt. Also Read: Here's Why 'Golden Showers' Is Trending (Yes, It Involves Trump) \nBuzzFeed reported Tuesday that a dossier “making explosive — but unverified” allegations has been circulating for weeks among elected officials, intelligence agents and reporters. It alleges that the Russian government has been “cultivating, supporting and assisting” Trump for years. \nCNN reported Tuesday both President Barack Obama and Trump were given a two-page synopsis of the report, which includes what BuzzFeed calls “specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations of contact between Trump aides and Russian operatives, and graphic claims of sexual acts documented by the Russians.” \nThose include this one: \n“According to Source D, where s/he had been present, TRUMP’s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) in front of him.” \nThe report went on to say that Trump’s behavior in Russia over the years had provided authorities there with enough “embarrassing material” on the president-elect to “blackmail him if they so wished.” \nA representative for the Trump campaign has not yet responded to TheWrap’s request for comment. 8 Times Donald Trump Was the President of Fake News (Photos) \nThis country has a problem with fake news, and unfortunately, the most prominent person sharing it is our president-elect, Donald Trump. Here are eight times he has shared unquestionably fake news stories. Getty Images \nIn 2009, Trump helped create fake news when the USA Network and WWE falsely reported that Trump was planning to buy \"Monday Night RAW.\" It turned out that it was all part of a wrestling storyline. \nTrump spent years demanding that President Obama produce his birth certificate and other papers in response to false e-mails that Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim . He finally admitted Obama was born in this country in September, then accused Hillary Clinton of starting the lies about Obama. \nTrump said last year that \" thousands and thousands of people were cheering \" in Jersey City, N.J. when the World Trade Center fell on Sept. 11, 2011. Although some radio stations and websites reported celebrations in nearby Paterson, N.J., the city denied the reports. \nIn February, Trump entertained conspiracy theories that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered when he said he was found with \"a pillow on his face.\" Alex Jones' InfoWars had earlier reported on suggestions Scalia was killed. But the owner of the ranch where Scalia died later clarified that he did not have a pillow over his face. \nIn June, Trump tweeted a photo that purported to show a family of African-Americans who supported him. But they told BuzzFeed they definitely did not. Twitter \nIn another case of Trump creating the fake news, he scored 22,000 retweets by posting, \"Just out according to @CNN: 'Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country.'\" But it was just one county . No R. \nOn Nov. 10, Trump tweeted that post-Election Day protestors were “professional,” but a professional fake-news writer, Paul Horner, admitted that he had invented a story about protesters being paid. \nGetty Images \nAfter saying for months before election day that the vote would be rigged, Trump won. Over the weekend he said “million of people” voted illegally. A guy on Twitter who had tweeted that 3 million voted illegally declined to provide any source. YouTube \nLet's give credit where its due: On Dec. 6, Trump fired one of his transition team staffers for tweeting a fake news story that led to an armed confrontation in a Washington, DC pizza restaurant. The issue became known as \"pizzagate.\" \nFeel free to bookmark this gallery. We have a feeling we'll be updating it.
