On our way to the (Brooklyn Nets) game!\" Bouchard tweeted from New York. \nThe Sports Illustrated swimsuit model later shared a video of the pair from their front row seats at the Barclays Center. \nThe Nets lost 129-125 to the visiting Milwaukee Bucks but that didn't spoil lucky John's night. Eugenie posted a cheeky video on Twitter (Photo: Twitter/geniebouchard) John was caught on camera looking less than enthralled (Photo: Twitter/geniebouchard) \nBouchard earlier said she was looking forward to heading out with the 20-year-old student from Missouri. \nShe told Sports Illustrated: “I want to honor my word and stay true to it, so I’m going on that date and that’s actually tonight. \n\"We’re going to go to the Brooklyn Nets game. He’s flying in this afternoon, so I look forward to meeting him tonight and I hope he enjoys it. And I hope it’s not too awkward.\" \nIt seems it clearly wasn't as the 22-year-old shared a cosy selfie with her date from the back of a cab. \nShe admitted: “After all the media attention it got, it was something I could, first of all, not back out of. There was no chance.. \n“I was worried, however, when I looked at his Twitter profile as soon as I lost the bet and his profile picture was a picture of Tiger Woods. I was like, ‘It’s one of those Twitter fans. I don’t even know what he looks like. What is going to happen?’ \n\"But it turns out he seems to be a very nice boy. Patriots fan John Goehrke blagged his way into a date with Bouchard (Photo: Splash News) \nHow it all came about will go down in history. \nAs Atlanta led 21-3, Bouchard was keen to tell her followers on social media that she knew the Falcons would win . \nNo team had ever overcome such a deficit in Super Bowl history, so it seemed like a long-shot when marketing student John replied to her tweet with the message: \"If patriots win we go on a date?\" \nLittle did he expect to get a reply from the 2014 Wimbledon finalist, let alone a date, until when, at the end of overtime and with the Patriots completing an historic 34-28 overtime win, Bouchard replied: \"So... where do you live?\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:02:39.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
