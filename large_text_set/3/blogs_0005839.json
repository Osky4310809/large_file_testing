It’s a funny and lighthearted way to poke fun at her and shows that she doesn’t take herself too seriously!\nJaclyn Hill / YouTube It helps that she used her Jaclyn Hill and Morphe palette in the video because we want every chance we can get to sneak a peek at that beauty!\nAnother #SneakPeek ✨This beautiful shimmery Champgane shade is from the upcoming @jaclynhill x @morphebrushes #MorpheXJaclynHill #EyeshadowPalette + Another look at this nude lipstick, which JH created for her upcoming makeup line ❤️ The palette will be launching ➡ around MARCH / Her makeup line will launch end of the year *we will keep u updated Can't wait to see the inside!
