I continue to be amazed by the variety of things you can buy on Amazon, but long ago, in the pages of the Sears Catalog, Amazon's predecessor, you could even buy a house. Between the years of 1908 and 1942, the Sears Roebuck company sold more than 70,000 of these Sears Catalog homes, which were built in locations all over the country. \nThe houses, which were shipped on railroad boxcars, came as giant kits, a concept you will be familiar with if you've ever tried to build a dollhouse. Everything was included: lumber, siding, windows and doors, shingles, flooring, even the kitchen sink. The only thing that wasn't included was plaster and brick for finishing the walls. (Plumbing, electrical fixtures and heating systems were not included in the base price but could be added on for an additional fee.) The Elsmore, a modest bungalow with two bedrooms.

Other innovations included drywall in place of plaster on lath and asphalt shingles, which were cheaper and easier to install than wood ones â€” and also fireproof. \nSince Sears was able to buy building materials in bulk, and because the pre-cut parts saved so much construction time, building a house from a kit could represent a significant savings over other construction methods. While Sears stopped selling kit homes in 1942, one of their competitors, Aladdin, was still selling pre-cut house kits until 1982 .
