BOY SANTOS \nMANILA, Philippines - Philippine police, “acting on instructions from the very top of government,” gunned down and enlisted others to kill thousands of alleged drug offenders in a wave of extrajudicial executions that may amount to crimes against humanity, Amnesty International (AI) said in a report released yesterday. \nAI’s investigation – “If you are poor you are killed”: Extrajudicial Executions in the Philippines’ “War on Drugs” – details how police “have systematically targeted mostly poor and defenseless people” across the country while planting “evidence,” recruiting paid killers, stealing from the people they kill and fabricating official incident reports. \nQuoting a police officer involved in the war on drugs, AI reported that police received from P8,000 to P15,000 as incentive for every drug personality they killed. \nThis was denied by officials of the Philippine National Police (PNP). President Duterte and other government officials have also consistently denied condoning extrajudicial killings, insisting that all the drug suspects killed in legitimate law enforcement operations had resisted arrest or fought it out – nanlaban. \nAI Philippines called on the Senate to reopen its investigation into extrajudicial killings following the group’s findings. \nThe Senate committees that conducted the investigation last year said there was no evidence to prove that extrajudicial killings in the course of the drug war were state-sponsored.   \nFor its part, the Archdiocese of Manila said it was pursuing its campaign against extrajudicial killings in the country despite the suspension of the PNP’s anti-drug campaign. \nFr. Atiliano Fajardo, head of the archdiocese’s public affairs ministry, revealed that they would hold the “Huwag Kang Magnakaw ng Buhay” (Do Not Steal Life) movement as part of the Church’s stance against killings of drug suspects and the proposed restoration of the death penalty. \nIn a press conference in Quezon City yesterday, AI Philippines trustee Sister Maria Vida Cordero and AI Philippines campaigner Wilnor Papa presented to the media the AI’s 66-page report, stating that “this is not a war on drugs, but a war on the poor.” \n“Often on the flimsiest of evidence, people accused of using or selling drugs are being killed for cash in an economy of murder,” said Tirana Hassan, AI’s Crisis Response director. \nWhat is happening in the Philippines is a crisis the entire world should be alarmed about, Hassan said, as AI called on government officials, from Duterte down, to order an immediate halt to all extrajudicial executions. \n“We are also calling on the… Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute anyone involved in these killings, regardless of their rank or status in the police or government,” Hassan said. \n“The Philippines should move away from lawlessness and lethal violence and reorient its drug policies towards a model based on the protection of health and human rights,” she added. \nThe AI said its team of researchers interviewed 110 people across the country, including some policemen, and documented 33 cases of drug-related killings, of which 20 occurred in police operations and 13 involved unknown armed men. A total of 59 people were killed in these operations, the report said. \n“We want the Senate to reopen its investigation (on EJKs), instead of prioritizing the death penalty bill. Unless we end this culture of impunity, these senseless killings, these crimes against humanity will continue,” Papa said. \nAI said the Philippines is a state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and must abide by international rules. \n“We want the Philippine authorities to deal with this human rights crisis on their own. But if decisive action is not taken soon, the international community should turn to the prosecutor of the (ICC) to carry out a preliminary examination into these killings, including the involvement of officials at the very top of government,” AI said. \n“Amnesty International is deeply concerned that the deliberate, widespread and systematic killings of alleged drug offenders, which appear to be planned and organized by the authorities, may constitute crimes against humanity under international law,” it added. In cash \nOne of those interviewed by the AI team for the report was a police officer with the rank of senior police officer 1 (SPO1) who has been in service for almost a decade. \nThe police officer, who claimed to have been part of an anti-drug unit in Metro Manila, said policemen usually receive financial incentives for every drug suspect or personality killed during the “encounter.” \n“We always get paid by the encounter... The amount ranges from P8,000 to P15,000... That amount is per head. So if the operation is against four people, that’s P32,000,” the police officer was quoted as saying in the report. \nThe police officer said the source of the money was never revealed to them, but the cash was usually given at their headquarters. \n“We’re paid in cash, secretly, by headquarters... There (are) no incentives for arresting. We’re not paid anything,” the police officer said, as quoted in the report. “It never happens that there’s a shootout and no one is killed.” \nThe police officer told the AI team that some of his colleagues also established a racket with funeral homes, which reward them for each dead body sent their way. \nThe AI said witnesses told the researchers that several policemen also stole from victims’ homes. \nThe AI report said two hired killers confessed to the team that they took orders from a police officer who supposedly paid them P5,000 for each drug user and P10,000 to P15,000 for each drug pusher killed, respectively. \n“The targets often come from unverified lists of people suspected to use or sell drugs drawn up by local government officials. Regardless of how long ago someone may have taken drugs, or how little they used or sold, they can find their name irrevocably added to the lists,” the report read. \n“In other cases, their names could be added arbitrarily, because of a vendetta or because there are incentives to kill greater numbers of people deemed drug users or sellers,” it added. \nThe AI said several residents as well as family members of the victims also narrated how policemen planted evidence against their slain targets. \n“Fabricating their subsequent incident reports, the police have routinely claimed that they had been fired upon first. Directly contradicting the police’s claims, witnesses told Amnesty International how the police conducted late night raids, did not attempt an arrest and opened fire on unarmed persons,” the AI said. \n“In some cases, witnesses said, the police planted drugs and weapons they later claimed as evidence,” it added. \nPapa said these findings call for the reopening of the investigation on EJKs to show the administration’s sincerity in cleansing the police ranks. \nAI said these extrajudicial killings were incited by the rhetoric of Duterte, who vowed to protect the police officers who would get to kill drug suspects in the course of the operations against the illegal drug trade. \nSince Duterte came to office seven months ago, there have been more than 7,000 drug-related killings, with the police directly killing at least 2,500 alleged drug offenders, AI noted. \nThe AI cited cases wherein suspects pleaded for mercy and surrendered but were still killed. Their bodies were also dragged and dumped or dehumanized, AI said. \nFajardo, meanwhile, said their new movement would like to emphasize that “life is sacred and only God can take it away.” \nIn an interview over Church-run Radio Veritas , the priest revealed that the campaign is a follow-up to their earlier advocacy campaigns “Huwag Kang Magnakaw” (Do Not Steal) and “Huwag Kang Pumatay” (Do Not Kill). \n“We saw in the past few months how lives have been stolen. This happened without sanction of law because there’s no due process,” he lamented. \n“We will ask the Church and the schools to show that they believe in the sacredness of life and that it cannot be stolen,” he stressed.
