Rwanda photographs that reunited families \n\"Today, genocide denial and trivialisation continue to flourish in certain groups within the Church and genocide suspects have been shielded from justice within Catholic institutions,\" a government statement said earlier on Monday. \nThe Pope's statement, which he said he hoped would help Rwanda heal, followed a meeting in Rome with Rwandan President Paul Kagame. \nMr Kagame described the comments on Monday as a great moment and a new chapter in relations between his country and the Vatican. \nMr Kagame, Tutsi, led a rebel force to halt the slaughter in 1994 as accusations surfaced that some priests and nuns had taken part in the killings. What happened in 1994? Media caption BBC News reports show how the story of the genocide emerged \nOn 6 April 1994, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana - a Hutu - was shot down, killing everyone on board. \nHutu extremists blamed the Tutsi rebel group the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), and immediately started a well-organised campaign of slaughter. \nThe RPF said the plane had been shot down by Hutus to provide an excuse for the genocide. \nBetween April and June, an estimated 800,000 people - mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus - died at the hands of Hutu extremists.
