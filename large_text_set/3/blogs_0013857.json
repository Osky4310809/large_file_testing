He always has a great impact because he is technically very good, and can put the ball where he wants. \n“He’s a great player. Often he’s decisive with the pass, with the assist, and also to score a goal. \n“For sure, Cesc gives you great quality, great fantasy and assists. \n“Cesc, this season, is showing to be a great professional but, above all, a great player. I’m very pleased to see that in him, his commitment and work-rate. This season he faced a new situation. \n“Cesc, in the past, has always played every single game. It’s not easy to change.
