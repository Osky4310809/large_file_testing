He added that the victim’s family was not amenable to the giving of blood money. \nFollowing Islamic rules, Jose said the Filipino worker’s body might be buried in Kuwait. \nPawa was accused of stabbing her employer’s 22-year-old daughter while asleep in May 2007 and sentenced to death by Kuwait’s Court of First Instance. The verdict was upheld by the Court of Cassation in 2013. \nBut Pawa’s camp had repeatedly denied the allegations, saying one of the victim’s relatives could have perpetrated the killing due to a love affair with a neighbor. \nOn Wednesday, Pawa’s brother Air Force Lt. Col. Angaris “Gary” Pawa said his sister informed him of the execution and bid goodbye to the family through a phone call.
