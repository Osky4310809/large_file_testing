For a more attainable off-road-ready look, Australians can now turn to the Toyota Racing Development (TRD) appearance package for the Hilux , incorporating 15 new components – seven of which are from the in-house tuning company. The kit is available only with the top-spec SR5 trim level, and comes with either black or white paint. \nMost of the new bits are at the front, where you’ll find a honeycomb grille, a protective bumper cover and a red skid plate. Matte black fender flares provide a more muscular appearance, while black plastic side mouldings, a black sports bar and 18-inch six-spoke alloy wheels complete the look. \nOn top of that are additional accessories such as a towing kit (including a tow hook and wiring harness), bedliner, soft tonneau cover, tail light covers and TRD mudflaps. Inside, there are TRD-branded floor mats and a TRD gearknob for models with an automatic transmission. 2017 Toyota HiLux with TRD accessories 2017 Toyota HiLux with TRD accessories \nThese go on top of the standard specification of the SR5 model, including self-levelling LED headlights, keyless entry, push-button start, climate control, cruise control, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a multifunction steering wheel and a touchscreen navigation system with DAB digital radio, Bluetooth, Toyota Link connectivity and a reverse camera. \nSafety-wise, the Hilux SR5 comes with seven airbags, stability control, trailer sway control, hill start assist and hill descent control. Also equipped is a rear locking differential and an electronic transfer case. Power comes from a 2.8 litre 1GD-FTV turbodiesel engine producing 177 PS and 450 Nm of torque with a six-speed automatic transmission, or 420 Nm with a six-speed manual. \nPricing for the Hilux with TRD accessories starts at A$58,990 (RM199,400) for white paint and A$59,540 (RM201,300) in black. Automatic models cost A$2,000 (RM6,800) more. 2017 Toyota HiLux with TRD accessories 2017 Toyota HiLux with TRD accessories 2017 Toyota HiLux with TRD accessories 2017 Toyota HiLux with TRD accessories 2017 Toyota HiLux with TRD accessories Research Toyota Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:25:08.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
