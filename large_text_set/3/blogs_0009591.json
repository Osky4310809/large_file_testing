IndiaToday.in , March 11, 2017 7:34:21 IST \nThe India Today-Axis Exit Poll for Goa predict a convincing victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the state with 18-22 seats, but the party facing the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, might not get a clear majority. \nThe incumbent government, led by BJP's Laxmikant Parsekar is fighting the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party and the Shiv Sena-MGP-GSM alliance in the election. \nWhile the BJP's aggressive campaign saw former CM of the state and current Defence Minister of India Manohar Parrikar on the field, the Aam Aadmi Party, making its debut this year, launched a massive campaign announcing former bureaucrat Evlis Gomes as its chief ministerail candidate. \n\nThe BJP had won 21 seats in the last Assembly Elections, and the Exit Poll predicts similar numbers. The Aam Aadmi Party, on the other hand, is seen winning only 2 seats as per the Exit Polls. \nThe Exit Polls predicted only a 9-13 seat win for the Congress, a number similar to what they had won in the previous Assembly Elections. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T04:04:55.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
