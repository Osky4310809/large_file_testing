And by “near future,” we mean “before this decade is up.”\nSrsly, “ Can’t Stop the Feeling ” is still an extremely catchy jam, and Timberlake’s tear-jerking “Trolls” song had us knee-deep in feels, but c’mon, JT! We’re starting to get more antsy by the minute. There’s only so many body rolls we can do 2013’s The 20/20 Experience , so the the progression of our dance moves depends on the arrival of your highly-anticipated new music.\n\nvia GIPHY \nAlso, we cannot forget the fact that Timberlake agreed to do a Britney Spears collaboration (even though it might’ve been just a case of former flames being friendly). We have no evidence to support that potential musical reunion has gone any further than the two singers being all, “Yeah, we’re totally down to bring the 2000s back,” for the sake of riling up their fans, BUT this pic of Timberlake and Timbaland hard at work in the studio is concrete evidence of musical magic in the making.\nThe masters at work. @jtimberlake #timbaland #justintimberlake pic.twitter.com/hkSQozf7KP \n— Timbaland (@Timbaland) March 18, 2017 Since Timbaland and Timberlake have a history of producing hit songs together, we’re beyond positive that this new music will be worth the wait. But for the sake of our sanity, we hope it’s sooner rather than later.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T03:02:56.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
