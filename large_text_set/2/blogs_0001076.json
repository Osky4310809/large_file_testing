Image copyright Twitter \nHe said: \"We don't see the need for a referendum - this is a diversion. \n\"What the Scottish government should be focusing on is what it was elected to do, which is to improve schools standards, get to grips with the problems in Scottish hospitals and reverse the serious rise in unemployment.\" \nThe minister urged the SNP to focus on the their \"day job\" and \"not get into the theology of whether or not a second referendum should be held\". \nThe Herald newspaper said it had asked Sir Michael whether the UK government would facilitate a referendum during the lifetime of this parliament. 'Disastrous move' \nIt quoted the Conservative politician as replying: \"No, forget it. The respect agenda is two way. \n\"She [Ms Sturgeon] is constantly asking us to respect the SNP government, but she has to respect the decision of the Scotland to stay inside the UK in 2014 and the decision of the UK to leave the EU. \n\"Respect works both ways.\" \nSir Michael was speaking ahead of a visit to Midlothian engineering firm MacTaggart Scott designs, at which he said the Treasury had approved the initial business case for a training school for naval crews working on the UK's nuclear submarines. \nThe submarine school would be built at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde, which will be home to all 11 Royal Navy submarines from 2020, a move which will see the number of people employed there rise from 6,800 to 8,200.

Must have realised what a disastrous move it would be for Tories.\" \nA spokesman for the first minister added: \"Any Tory bid to block a referendum would be a democratic outrage, but would only succeed in boosting support for both a referendum and for independence itself - something which the prime minister has previously indicated she understands all too well. \n\"Our mandate is unequivocal, with a manifesto commitment which makes explicitly clear that the Scottish Parliament should have the right to decide on an independence referendum if Scotland faces being taken out of the EU against our will. \n\"Michael Fallon's comments betray how rattled the Tories are about Scotland - but his frantic backpedalling when pressed on the issue this morning shows that he understands what a disastrous strategy it would be for them to try and deny Scotland's democratic right.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T13:18:34.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
