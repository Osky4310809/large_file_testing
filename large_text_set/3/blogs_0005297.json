Xiaobo said the store’s employees seemed both confused and skeptical about the double charge, even after he provided them with the case number. Eventually, they told him they could not authorize a refund.\n“They said ‘How do we know it’s a genuine number you got?’” he said. “It seemed like they looked at me like I was looking for trouble.” \nWhen contacted about the refund, the Zara store employees directed BuzzFeed News to Zara headquarters, where a rep refused to comment.\nID: 10657212 4.

Xiaobo said he’s in the process of filing assault charges against the security officers involved. He added that there are several witnesses to the incident, some of whom followed him out of the Zara store as he was being escorted.\n“I want to make it clear that this is not about the money anymore. It’s the experience I was going through,” he said. “Nobody should have to be going through this.”\nThe local police did not immediately return a request for comment from BuzzFeed News.\nID: 10657547 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! \nTanya Chen is a social news reporter for BuzzFeed and is based in New York.
