Nokia 3 vs Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime vs Lenovo K6 Power: can Nokia be the budget favourite again? By - February 27, 2017 “Comparing the recently-launched Nokia 3 to the Xiaomi Redmi 3S prime and the Lenovo K6 Power” \nNokia has officially made a comeback. The iconic brand has jumped ship to Android and everyone is glad to see one of the most reputed smartphone names back in the business. However, a lot has changed since Nokia was around last. The budget segment in which Nokia launched all three of its new smartphones is currently being reigned by Chinese tech giants such as Lenovo and Xiaomi. Nokia clearly has an uphill battle to win if it wants to establish itself as the very best once again therefore, we decided to compare the recently launched Nokia 3 ( first impressions ) with the current budget favourites – Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime ( review ) and the Lenovo K6 Power ( first impressions ) to see if it has a chance. Read on to find more. Design and Display \nDesign-wise, both the Lenovo K6 Power and the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime come sporting unibody metal designs. This gives both the aforementioned smartphones a slight edge over the Nokia 3, which is constructed primarily out of polycarbonate with an aluminium frame on the sides (pictured above). All the three smartphones come equipped with fingerprint sensors too. The Lenovo K6 Power (as seen above) comes with a 5-inch full HD display panel. On the contrary, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime and the Nokia 3 have opted for a 5-inch HD panels making the Lenovo K6 Power a much better smartphone for media consumption. Performance, Software and Storage \nFor performance, the Lenovo K6 Power and the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime (pictured above) employ Snapdragon 430 processors along with 3GB of RAM for multitasking. The Nokia 3 is left playing catchup once again with its MediaTek MT6737 chip which works in tandem with two gigs of RAM. While Nokia’s offering does look a tad weaker in comparison as far as the number crunching is concerned, you’ll have to wait for our full review until we give our final verdict on the smartphone’s performance. \nSoftware is where the Nokia 3 (pictured above) truly shines. Unlike its competitors, the Nokia 3 offers its buyers the latest Android Nougat in the purest form – free from unnecessary clutter and gimmicks. This on its own will be reason enough for a large number of people to go with the Nokia 3 over the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime which runs MIUI 8 with Android Marshmallow as base, or the Lenovo K6 Power, which runs a near-stock version of Android Marshmallow. For storage, both the Redmi 3S Prime and the Lenovo K6 Power ship with 32GB of onboard memory which can be further expanded up to 128GB via a microSD card. The Nokia 3 comes with 16GB of internal storage instead, and gives its users an option to bump it up up to 128GB via a microSD card. Camera, Battery and Connectivity \nThe Nokia 3 comes with a pair of 8MP sensors on the back and the front respectively. On the other hand, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime comes with a 13MP primary sensor and a 5MP secondary sensor. Lastly, the Lenovo K6 Power comes with a 13MP main camera and an 8MP selfie shooter. While the Nokia 3 is clearly outmatched when it comes to the pixel count on the primary camera, we’d like to emphasise on the fact that the number of megapixels isn’t the only parameter for gauging a smartphone’s camera performance. In the battery department, both the Lenovo K6 Power and the Xiaomi Redmi 3S prime feature massive battery units with the former equipped with a 4,000mAh cell and the latter with a 4,100mAh pack. The Nokia 3 on the other hand, comes with a smaller 2,650mAh battery. However, seeing how Nokia made a name for itself by offering outstanding battery life with its previous smartphones and feature phones, we aren’t too concerned about the battery life of the Nokia 3. All the three smartphones come with standard connectivity options along with support for 4G LTE. So if you happen to be in the market for a budget smartphone, should you buy the Nokia 3 over its competition? Well, if you are a spec-heavy consumer, then the Nokia 3 may not excite you. However, if you don’t care much about what a smartphone packs underneath and are only interested in its everyday performance, then the Nokia 3 just might surprise you with its sturdy build quality, vanilla software and optimised hardware. We’ll just have to wait and watch… Facebook Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:23:32.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
