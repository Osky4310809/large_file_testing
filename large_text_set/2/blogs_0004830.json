Watch video Shahid Kapoor wants to hurl his shoe at Harshvardhan Kapoor. But why? This video will answer it. By moumita bhattacharjee | Published: February 7, 2017 7:40 pm Shahid Kapoor, Jacqueline Fernandez, Shah Rukh Khan rock the February magazine covers \nShahid Kapoor went for the Dangal success party with his beautiful wife Mira Rajput. They were having a great time, when suddenly Shahid said something which left everyone a bit zapped. While speaking to the media on the red carpet, the Rangoon actor suddenly bellowed, “Joota maaru utha ke?” and the person at the receiving end was Sonam Kapoor’s brother Harshvardhan Kapoor. Now before you go all what is this way of talking to each other on Shahid, let us tell you everything happened in jest. Yes, these two Kapoors didn’t get into any kind of a fight. They were just pulling each other’s leg.

So Shahid and Mira walked the red carpet and stood in front of the podium to speak to the press. They were answering questions when Harsh walked past them greeting Mira and tapping on Shahid’s shoulder. The latter then hugged the Mirzya actor and they had a brief conversation. When Shahid realised that Harsh is leaving, he told Mira, “We made a very late entry. All these young boys are leaving.” That’s when Harsh says something about making way for the seniors, which isn’t clearly audible. That makes Shahid say jokingly, “Joota maru utar ke, senior bol raha hai.” We are sure Harsh too must have had a laugh. Check out the video right here and go to 2:34 to see the entire conversation. \nShahid has worked with Sonam in Mausam and we are pretty sure both the Kapoor lads are good friends. Work-wise, Harshvardhan is working on Bhavesh Joshi whereas Shahid will be seen next in Rangoon. He is also working on Padmavati where he plays a Maharaja. We can’t wait to see his look. \n\nPublished: February 7, 2017 7:40 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:19:56.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
