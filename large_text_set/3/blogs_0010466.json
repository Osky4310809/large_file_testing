There has been speculation about Poe’s back injuries, something Ballard would have intimate knowledge of. Also a factor could be Poe's projected asking price, rumored to be north of $10 million per season. Teams generally assign a price range to a particular player and, if disciplined, stay within it during negotiations. \nIf the Colts don’t land Poe but remain interested in acquiring an interior defensive lineman, some attractive options are still available. Among them is New York Giants free agent Jonathan Hankins, just 24 and coming off a 43-tackle season. Bennie Logan of the Philadelphia Eagles is also out there. \nThe Colts could also redirect resources elsewhere. \nOne position where there seems to be significant depth remaining is inside linebacker. Free agents like Dont’a Hightower (Patriots), Zach Brown (Bills) and Kevin Minter (Cardinals) are all still available in what looks like a slow-moving inside linebacker market. That might create the opportunity for some bargain signings in the days to come. 120 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T02:32:26.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
