Idea and Vodafone launch offers with free data and unlimited calling to counter Jio [updated] By March 3, 2017 “Idea and Vodafone are offering up to 1GB data and unlimited calling to select users” \n[Update: March 3rd, 2017] : We have received a statement from Vodafone on the new offer, which reads, “Vodafone customers are diverse as are their wants. To satisfy these diverse needs and wants, Vodafone offers various segmented propositions. This is one such segmented offering and the offer is valid only till 15 March ”. The teleco said that it runs various offers, this is one of these offers, which is valid till March 15th. To compete against the fast-growing telecom operator Reliance Jio’s Prime membership plans , India’s leading telcos are launching special plans as countermeasures. As part of a promotional offer, India’s leading telco Airtel recently started offering some users 14GB of data and unlimited calls within its own network. Now Idea Cellular and Vodafone have also launched similar offers for their subscribers. \nIdea Cellular’s new plan is priced at Rs 348 per month, and comes with perks like unlimited voice calls on any network and 500MB of 4G data every day. The new pack comes with a validity of 28 days. Unfortunately, Idea’s new plan is not available to all subscribers. The brand said the new pack is being offered to those Idea users who don’t consume much data. The company wants these users to increase their mobile data consumption by opting for this plan.
