Leigh tells Curbed that the home’s previous owner hoped to tear it down and build condos on the quarter-acre lot, but a prolonged battle with the Garvanza HPOZ Board prevented that from happening.\nNow, the couple has given the hundred-year-old home a major makeover, with the assistance of preservation architect Louisa Van Leer. Featuring new hardwood floors, appliances, cabinetry, and just about everything else, the main house is light, airy, and open. On the exterior, it’s sporting a new paint job and a drought-tolerant garden.\nThe couple also restored a smaller house next door and a garage behind the main residence—now converted into an in-law unit. Together, the two additional structures contain three more bedrooms and two-and-a-half bathrooms. They’ll come in handy for buyers looking for extra space or rental income.\nThe before and after pictures below detail the dramatic transformation over the past year. After paying $1.1 million in 2016, online records show, Leigh and Hernandez have listed the refreshed property for $2.199 million.\nBefore photos by Louisa Van Leer \n405 North Avenue 66 [Dana Coronado | Keller Williams Studio City] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T06:55:35.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
