There are many other ways to test valuable Bakelite pieces that are much safer and several of them only require your senses to accomplish. It's good to employ more than one of these tests until you get very comfortable identifying Bakelite. \nIt's true that some folks well-versed in Bakelite identification recommend the hot water test as the standard when it comes to accurately identifying this form of plastic. While this has proven to be an effective method of testing to release the formaldehyde-like scent of Bakelite, most collectors don't have access to hot water while in the middle of a flea market field where they are making buying decisions. Given this fact, it's wise to learn various methods to identify Bakelite rather than learning after the fact that you've made a mistake. \nAgain , you may need to employ more than one test to rule out a false result. Use all your senses in concert to help you determine whether or not the object you are holding is Bakelite. Nick Young/Moment Open/Getty Images 1. Testing by Sound \nOne way to start is listening for the \"clunk\" when two pieces you know to be Bakelite are tapped together. This very distinctive sound is often heard when two or more Bakelite bangles are worn at the same time. Try gently tapping two pieces of another type of plastic together, and compare the sound to two pieces of true Bakelite the next time you're out shopping where this type of plastic is on display. You'll need to do other tests, of course, to confirm. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Places to Sell Your Crafts Carved Bakelite Bangle. Photo by Jay B. Siegel for ChicAntiques.com 2. Testing by Feel \nConsider the weight of a piece of plastic jewelry. Bakelite feels heavier when compared to other types of plastics like celluloid. Hold another type of plastic in one hand, and a piece you know to be Bakelite of approximately the same size in the other. You'll often notice the heavier feel of Bakelite. Again, more testing will be required to confirm, but this is another good point of departure when out shopping. Carved Wood Turtle Dress Clip with Bakelite Back. Photo by Jay B. Siegel for ChicAntiques.com 3. Testing by Smell \nRub the item in question vigorously with your thumb until you feel the plastic heat up. Then, before it cools, take a whiff. A distinct chemical odor similar to formaldehyde will linger with most genuine Bakelite. This often takes a bit of practice, but it works well for many people while out shopping. \nSome noses find better results when the piece of plastic is placed under very hot running tap water before sniffing it. This test works well with bangle bracelets that are made entirely of Bakelite, and is a very good way to confirm a piece once you get it home. \nWith pieces like the clip shown here, the wood may be damaged if it gets wet. If wood is present, it's best to stick to other methods of testing only the Bakelite portion of the piece that don't involve immersing it in water. Bakelite Figural Candleholders. Photo by Jay B.

You can also use it to test Bakelite for authenticity, and this is the preferred method for many plastics lovers (although others prefer the hot water test mentioned above). \nTo test with Simichrome, sparingly apply to a soft cloth and gently rub a small spot on the inside or back of the item being tested. If it's Bakelite, the cloth should turn yellow with ease (although the color may vary from light to dark). If a piece is laquered, it may test negative. Black Bakelite pieces often fail this test as well. Use the other tests above, especially the hot water test, to confirm authenticity if a piece you suspect to be Bakelite fails with Simichrome. \nBakelite testing pads are also an alternative to carrying a tube of Simichrome polish with you when you shop. These pads provide a similar result to Simichrome or the 409 method mentioned below and have proven to be quite reliable. Following up with the hot water test when you get home is also an option.

Testing by Sight - Using Formula 409 Cleaner \nScrubbing Bubbles was once the standard cleaner to use for Bakelite testing, but Formula 409 is now recommended instead. To use, dampen a cotton swab with 409 and rub it gently on the inside of the item being tested. If it's Bakelite, the swab will turn yellow. \nIf a piece is laquered, it may test negative with 409. Black Bakelite pieces often fail this test as well. Use the other tests above, especially the hot water test, to confirm authenticity if a piece you suspect to be Bakelite fails with 409.

Testing by Sight - Inspect the Piece Closely \nLook for wear scratches and patina that very new pieces of plastic don't normally exhibit. Also look for tiny chips on the edges of carving. Examine the piece with a jeweler's loupe or another type of magnifier, if needed. Generally, an old piece of Bakelite will exhibit some minor scratching and wear, even though it is in excellent condition by a collector's standards. \nAlso keep in mind that Bakelite will not have mold seams that can be present in other types of plastic jewelry. With some practice, you'll learn to use all your senses to correctly identify Bakelite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T13:19:24.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
