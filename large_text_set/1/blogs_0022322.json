After months of waiting, the Giuseppe x Jennifer shoe collection is finally here. Last summer, we first got word that the superchic Jennifer Lopez was teaming up with one of her favorite shoe designers, Giuseppe Zanotti. The end result? Six shoe styles so pretty they each deserve their own glass case. While, Zanotti has created custom shoes for Lopez in the past, this is the first time the two have launched a line together. It is also Lopez's first high-end designer collaboration (she currently has an affordable fashion line with Kohl's). As you take a closer look at the collection, you'll find that each shoe maintains the elegant Zanotti style, but with a glam J.Lo twist . The Giuseppe x Jennifer collection includes cut-out suede booties (surely inspired by her plethora of cut-out dresses ), snake-skin leather sandals, crystal-enrobed booties, and a cute pair of wedge sneakers. Each shoe comes in a bunch of color options, mostly ice-blue, navy, and gray. A few also come in rose gold, which Lopez told WWD is her favorite color. Two of the shoes have a gladiator-inspired design, so clearly one of our favorite summer trends will be back in 2017.
