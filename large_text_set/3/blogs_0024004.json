Sometimes this resistance takes the form of sweeping displays, such as protests and rallies, but often it’s the quiet, steadfast work of a few that can bring the most dramatic results. \nHere are six such people, whose contributions have become increasingly crucial in the months following Trump’s inauguration. Mark Rosenbaum helped free an Afghan family caught in Trump's travel ban at LAX. Courtesy Public Counsel \nMark Rosenbaum, director of Public Counsel's Opportunity Under Law project \nAfter working with the American Civil Liberties Union for 40 years, Rosenbaum joined Public Counsel a little more than two years ago. He and his network of attorneys have spent the last few months on the front lines of Trump’s anti-immigration policies, defending DACA recipients and challenging travel bans in court. \n“It’s just been a nonstop violation of the constitutional rights of individuals who were promised that they would be treated with respect and dignity, and who have made major contributions to the national security of this country,” Rosenbaum says. \nOn March 2, an Afghan family of five arrived at LAX with special immigration visas but were detained at the airport. The father, in his work as an on-the-ground interpreter for the U.S. government in Kabul, was repeatedly threatened while protecting American citizens, yet when he tried to touch down on American soil he and his family were not welcomed, according to Rosenbaum. \nThe attorney and his team sprung into action, securing a restraining order against the immigration agents attempting to hold the family and, ultimately, freeing them. \n“Our second home is LAX since the travel ban,” Rosenbaum says. Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia is pushing a \"tampon tax\" bill that would make menstrual products and diapers tax-free. Courtesy Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia \nCristina Garcia, assemblywoman for the 58th District \nIn her fifth year as a state assemblywoman and her first as the chair of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus, Garcia has advocated for enhanced clean air standards, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of women’s rights. \nShe has introduced another “tampon tax” bill (after a failed first attempt) that would eliminate taxes on menstrual products and diapers. And she’s involved in complementary legislation that would offset the loss of tax income loss for the state with a higher excise tax on hard alcohol. \n“Why I am being taxed for being born with a uterus?” Garcia says. “Periods don’t discriminate based on your income.” Related Stories 10 Ways to Fight a Trump Presidency in Liberal California \nGarcia also has introduced legislation that would provide free menstrual products in schools, universities and homeless shelters. \nTrump has perpetuated the idea that women don’t have any self-agency, according to Garcia. She says that while she'd like to spend her time pushing for progress, she is forced instead to defend the gains made by women before her as they're constantly threatened by the Trump administration. \nAurora Garcia-Barrera, Southern California regional organizer for Health Access \nPrior to Trump’s election, much of Garcia-Barrera’s work revolved around trying to expand the coverage and care provided under the Affordable Care Act. Now she’s trying to keep access to health care from plummeting. \n“My day-to-day looked very different before November,” Garcia-Barrera says. \nHealth Access is a California consumer advocacy coalition that works to improve public health programs, advocate for patient coverage and secure protection and funding for programs such as Medi-Cal and Medicare. \nGarcia-Barrera, who operates out of Health Access’ Glendale office, says that since January the coalition has hosted events every week, from rallies to town halls to candlelight vigils targeting certain members of Congress. “A slow week means we had two to three events throughout the state,” she says. \nGarcia-Barrera also has helped spread Health Access’ #Fight4OurHealth campaign, which educates Californians about the importance of affordable and accessible health care and shares the stories of those who would be most affected by repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. And she leads many of Health Access’ Regional Response teams, which are responsible for quickly assembling emergency actions when a new proposal related to the Affordable Care Act is released or scheduled to be voted on.
