This fall/winter season, they’re returning to their classic approach with a brand new set of colorful menswear essentials.\nUtilizing a highly diverse color palette of browns, blues, green and burgundy, the entirety of the set screams “sharp” while the range of colors allows for more than enough options in variety. You’ll also notice within the denim section that classy cuts have made their way into the lineup, which will serve as a welcome departure from the modern influx of joggers and sports-inspired silhouettes.\nTake a look at the gallery above for the full collection and for more from Band of Outsiders, check out their earlier fall/winter collection here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:10:18.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
