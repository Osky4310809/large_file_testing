Rand Paul (R-KY) has come under fire as of late for being a little too agreeable with President Donald Trump. \nRecently New York Magazine wrote an article titled “Fox News Congratulates Rand Paul For Being Loyal Trump Stooge,” in which author Jonathan Chait writes “the Republican Party has largely decided to cover for Donald Trump’s massive corruption, grotesque lies, and manifest unfitness for office. But few of them have gone quite so far, or quite so cravenly, as Rand Paul.” \nPaul recently appeared on Fox and Friends with Steve Doocey to respond to this accusation directly. \n“So, New York Magazine says you’re Trump’s most loyal stooge because, while other members of your party have some opposition to Mr. Trump, you seem to want to actually advance his agenda,” said Doocey. \n“The haters are gonna hate, what are you gonna do?” joked Paul. “But what I would say is that the evidence is quite to the contrary. I’m probably one of the most independent senators on the hill. I work with Democrats. I work with Republicans. If I like what the president is doing – and I think a lot of what he’s doing is good – I’m happy to support it.” \n“I was the only Republican that voted against a budget that would have added $9 trillion in new debt. So I’m hardly someone who’s afraid to tout the party line,” added Paul. \nIndeed, Paul has been on the front lines of opposing the Republican budget that would add over $9 million to the national debt, resisting it even though Republicans touted it as a “vehicle to repeal Obamacare.” This includes giving a 20 minute presentation on the Senate Floor , and even walking out of one budgetary meeting in frustration after Republicans began discussing keeping parts of Obamacare that they were voted in to get rid of. \nHowever, the gripe that New York Magazine has with Paul is that he dismissed the need for an investigation into former White House security adviser Michael Flynn, saying that it would be a waste of time to have Republicans investigating Republicans as the President has already handled it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:21:48.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
