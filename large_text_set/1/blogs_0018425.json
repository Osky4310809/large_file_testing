It's 2017 and this is the year that J. K. Rowling was referring to. We saw Harry Potter, Ginny Weasley, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley at Platform 9 ¾ sending their kids off to Hogwarts and \"All was well\". James Sirius Potter is starting his third year and Albus Severus Potter is all set to step foot in Hogwarts for the first time. \nLast year, with the release of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , we got to know that Albus gets sorted into Slytherin (he feared this very thing on the platform that day) and his closest friend is Scorpius Malfoy, who is Malfoy's son. We did get a peek into Harry's life from that play, however we weren't too satisfied. For one, it certainly lacked the H.P magic. So we've decided to revisit the family, nineteen years later, in 2017. Let's just say we've rewritten their stories a tad ... As per tradition, the Minister of Magic has to go meet the Muggle minister. We sure pity Kingsley Shacklebolt (Hermione became Minister for Magic in 2019) for having to go and meet Donald Trump. Apart from serving in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement we bet Hermione is busy fighting for equal rights for witches and Muggles alike. We can so see her being best friends with Emma Watson whom she met at a UN conference. Luna Lovegood must have figured out a way to use the internet, by now. We bet she has an Instagram account dedicated to all the nice, not so believable things in her life. She would have also managed to start a Quibbler website for all us no-maj people. Ted Lupin and Victoire Weasley are the newest IT couple this year! We bet the magical community has upgraded the Knight Bus to a taxi service by now. Courtesy Muggle Uber. Mr. Weasley must have managed to find that one Muggle friend who FaceTimes him each time he uses the washing machine. Gone are the days of using a Protean Charm to communicate ... we bet there is a Whatsapp group right now by the name of Weasley- Potter-Granger-Lupin-Longbottom-Lovegood. Neville Longbottom, apart from being a teacher, would also be all over Snapchat. He's also become hot. Hagrid's newest obsession would be inviting the first years over for tea and showing them Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movie.
