As the golfer was making his way up the fairway, he noticed a large gator hanging out near a water hazard at   on Thursday. Now, anybody who is familiar with gators probably knows that alligators are apex predators and probably shouldn't be startled. Cody Gribble, a brave man #APinv pic.twitter.com/hKkryY6nsT â€” Birdie 18 (@Birdie18th) March 16, 2017 \nGribble did not care. He walked straight to the gator and gave the creature a push on the tail, which sent it right into the water hazard. \nWho does that? Hasn't he seen Happy Gilmore ? Chubbs Peterson lost his hand doing that very act. \nDespite his bravery, Gribble was 4-over par through 16 holes.
