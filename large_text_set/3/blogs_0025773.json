Families who get coverage through their employer are paying, on average, thousands of dollars less per year than if costs kept rising as fast as they were before the law. And reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a 'death spiral,' because while it's true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all. And so long as the law is properly administered, this market will remain stable.\"\nObama argued that the law \"is no 'job-killer,' because America’s businesses went on a record-breaking streak of job growth in the seven years since I signed it.\"\nHe said everyone should welcome changes to the law if \"Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they’re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals.\"\n\"The Affordable Care Act is law only because millions of Americans mobilized, and organized, and decided that this fight was about more than health care – it was about the character of our country. It was about whether the wealthiest nation on Earth would make sure that neither illness nor twist of fate would rob us of everything we’ve worked so hard to build. It was about whether we look out for one another, as neighbors, and fellow citizens, who care about each other’s success,\" he continued. \"This fight is still about all that today. And Americans who love their country still have the power to change it.\"\nAfter Republican leaders made overnight changes to the bill in an effort to secure enough votes for passage, President Trump added an 11:30 a.m. meeting with the conservative House Freedom Caucus to his schedule. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who had been scheduled to give his weekly press conference at 11:30 a.m., bumped that to 3:30 p.m.\nThere were reports this morning that the Freedom Caucus and Trump had reached an agreement of sorts -- former chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told CNN \"there's progress being made but we'll see if we can get an agreement that's going to do what we've always had as the goal \" -- but Republicans are hemorrhaging votes elsewhere, too.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2017/03/23/obama-appears-on-morning-of-obamacare-replacement-vote-to-insist-aca-not-a-job-killer/\nload more", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:59:39.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
