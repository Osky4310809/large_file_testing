However, they are all very bulky and very expensive. Today, E-Ink has announced a new competitor to those kinds of products. It has developed a 42-inch display that can offer similar features for a lower cost.\nSee also: E Ink breakthrough brings full color displays that can stay on indefinitely May 26, 2016 This new 4:3 display will give products that use it “an ultra-wide viewing angle that can be viewed in both landscape and portrait modes”. It includes support for a display resolution of 2160×2880 and 85dpi, which should offer supporting products higher clarity for both text and images.\nIn fact, one such device has already announced its use of the new larger E-Ink display. QuirkLogic will use it for its Quilla digital ink solution. QuirkLogic and E-Ink have been working together for the past three years on the new 42-inch display. The 22-pound Quilla can easily be mounted or unmounted to move to any room or location. Several of the devices can also be linked together to form one very, very large digital whiteboard.\nThe Quilla will support logins from a smartphone for users to get quick access to their library of notes and images. Content created on the display is also automatically saved and can be shared with others. The device is scheduled to go on sale sometime late in the second quarter of 2017. Pricing has not yet been announced, but interested businesses can apply to be accepted into its Early Adopter program, which will start in February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T16:20:12.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
