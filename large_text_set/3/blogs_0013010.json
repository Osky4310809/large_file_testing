(JOSH EDELSON/AFP/Getty Images) \nSAN JOSE (KCBS) – A federal judge is giving Donald Trump supporters the green light to pursue their lawsuit against the city of San Jose. The plaintiffs accuse the city for not protecting them during a campaign rally last year. \nThe Trump supporters in this case claim that San Jose police officers intentionally steered them into an angry mob of protesters, following a Trump campaign rally last June. \n“We’ve seen video appearing on international local and national media that shows the police standing by as people were getting gruesomely attacked,” said Charles Moran is with the California Log Cabin Republicans. \nOn Wednesday, federal judge Lucy Koh allowed the lawsuit against the city and individual police officers to go forward, however she dismissed claims against Police Chief Eddie Garcia. \nLast year, Mayor Sam Liccardo said the lawsuit was baseless. \n“The notion that there was some stand down order is ridiculous,” Liccardo said. \nCity Attorney Rick Doyle is confident the city will prevail. Doyle said Wednesday that police officers didn’t do anything wrong and were trying to maintain some kind of crowd control in a chaotic situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T08:21:47.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
