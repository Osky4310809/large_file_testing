It assessed the most recent version of the bill and concluded that it will still take coverage away from 24 million people, just like the original version of the bill, but will cost an additional $186 billion to do so. \nLet me say that again: The revised bill spends $186 billion more to not cover the same number of people. What a win!\nKeep that in mind as the House proceeds to vote on an even newer version of the bill Friday, that still hasn't been released, and that the CBO will not be given time to score in advance.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:49:55.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
