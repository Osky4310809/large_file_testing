We have been blessed two times over.' Published 7:23 AM, February 02, 2017 Updated 8:13 AM, February 02, 2017 BLESSED WITH TWINS. Beyonce pictured in the announcement post on Instagram. Photo courtesy Instagram/Beyonce \nNEW YORK CITY, USA – Beyoncé is pregnant – and this time, she's expecting twins with her husband, rap mogul Jay Z. \nThe pop superstar – who already has a 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, with Jay Z – announced the news to her more than 92 million followers on Instagram on Wednesday, February 1. \nClad in panties and a bra under a flowing veil, Beyoncé posted a picture of herself kneeling beside a human-size floral arrangement, her hands cradling her rounded belly. \n\"We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over,\" the 35-year-old singer wrote. \n\"We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for all your well wishes,\" she added, signing with Jay Z. A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nIn a timeline sure to trigger intrigue, Beyoncé announced the pregnancy a little more than 9 months after her last album \"Lemonade\" – in which she strongly hinted that Jay Z was unfaithful. \nBeyoncé released \"Lemonade,\" an album intertwined with a film, on April 23. One lyric warns an unfaithful man of a \"final warning\" that he's \"gonna lose your wife\" if his behavior doesn't change. \nA sullen Jay Z appears at the end of the film to embrace her, suggesting reconciliation. \n\"Lemonade\" is in the running for album of the year at the Grammy Awards on February 12, where Beyoncé leads the nominations. \nHer baby bump will presumably be even more evident two months later, when she is set for the first time to headline Coachella, the two-weekend festival in southern California that is among the world's premier live music events. \nPrevious miscarriage \nTypically reserved, Beyoncé has openly spoken about the pain of a miscarriage before she gave birth to Blue Ivy, saying the heartbeat she had heard during her first pregnancy was \"the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life.\" \nNews of the twins prompted an avalanche of postings on social media – which included a guessing game on the children's names. \nTwitter reported half a million tweets on Beyoncé within the first 45 minutes as she became the world's top trending item. \n\"When Beyoncé is pregnant I am pregnant,\" the popular YouTube comedian Tre Melvin tweeted, calling the news a \"marvelous start\" to February, marked in the United States as Black History Month. \nSeveral of Beyoncé's fans – presumably critics of new US President Donald Trump – declared the announcement the happiest development so far of 2017. \nSome fans imagined the prospect of a new Jackson-style musical family, with Blue Ivy as the big sister and guide to the twins. \nBeyoncé was a music prodigy herself when she was growing up in Houston. Then known as Beyoncé Knowles, she started her career as the teenage lead singer of Destiny's Child. \nShe and Jay Z are among the most commercially successful figures in music, with a combined net worth estimated at $1 billion. \nWhile enjoying a wide following, Beyoncé has increasingly felt comfortable showing her political side. She and Jay Z hit the trail for Hillary Clinton in her unsuccessful campaign against Trump last year. \nThe first single on \"Lemonade,\" the bouncy New Orleans-inspired track \"Formation,\" was accompanied by a video that throws support behind the Black Lives Matter campaign against police brutality. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
