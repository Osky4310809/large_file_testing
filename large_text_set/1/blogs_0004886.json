Johnson’s name appears to be redacted in the 22-page affidavit, made public by a judge.\n“Brooke Higgins wrote she had wished she had done Columbine with Eric and Dylan, they were incredibly smart and everything in Eric’s journal made sense to her,” the affidavit says, relaying information from the teen’s journal. “Brooke Higgins wrote she had very similar thoughts to Eric and wanted to be in charge, destroy and be impossible to kill.”\nThe 1999 Columbine High School attack, which left 12 students and a teacher dead, was committed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Authorities have also said Johnson referenced the movie “Natural Born Killers” — an obsession of the Columbine High gunmen — in her journal.\nThe affidavit added, from the journal: “Brooke Higgins indicated she wanted to die, advised she died long ago and she was an empty shell.”\nHiggins and Sienna Johnson were charged as adults with conspiracy to commit murder last year in the alleged plan to attack students and staff at Mountain Vista. Last month, Higgins — now 17 — pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree and murder solicitation in the first degree, agreeing to a stipulated sentence of three years in the Division of Youth Corrections.\nJohnson, who appeared in court Friday morning, is still going through the legal system. The affidavit for Higgins was released by District Judge Paul A. King following her plea ahead of a formal February sentencing.\nThe document says the attack was planned for either just before or just after winter break because, according to one of the girls, that “would be the most ‘traumatic’ for everyone.”\n“There was a pact between the two girls to carry out the shooting no matter if one side was unavailable to participate,” the affidavit said.\nThe affidavit also indicates the teens were waiting to carry out the attack until they had trained. One of the girls, whose name is redacted, had apparently searched online how to make a bomb while Higgins had tried to get a gun from a friend of a friend’s parents.\nAt one point, Higgins — who had been using cocaine — had even gone to a gun shop, the affidavit shows. It appears, however, that neither girl ever obtained any weapons.\nAuthorities also have said that Johnson and Higgins made detailed maps of Mountain Vista in Highlands Ranch that included locations of specific community members, including deputies assigned to protect the campus.\nJohnson’s friends raised concerns to a school counselor about her behavior several months before her arrest in December 2015, The Denver Post found . She was vetted and no prosecution was pursued after the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office says it found no criminal wrongdoing.\nAbout a month later, authorities were alerted to the plot by a text-message tip to the state’s anonymous warning system called “Text-A-Tip,” the affidavit shows. The program was a response to the Columbine attack.\nA subsequent warning from the mother of one of the teen’s, who found writings about the planned attack, led investigators to uncover what they said was an imminent threat to Mountain Vista. “I think the text message and the information we obtained through our investigation saved lives, for sure, given the severity of the situation,” Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said shortly after the girls’ arrest.\nStaff writer Kieran Nicholson contributed to this report. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T02:39:37.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
