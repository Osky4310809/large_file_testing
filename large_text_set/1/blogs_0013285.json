Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA \nThe announcement was made ahead of fresh talks between the two sides aimed at resolving a dispute over driver-only trains. \nAngie Doll, Southern’s passenger services director, said: “Whilst inevitably there will be disruption next Monday, the good news is that due to the changes we’ve now fully rolled out, we’re now able to run more services on more routes serving more passengers and ultimately we’ll have fewer cancellations and delays. \n“Next Monday, some 200 extra trains will be running and several routes will have their first service on an RMT strike day. \n“The RMT should now recognise that their industrial action is wholly futile. They should stop the strikes, get back round the table with us and move forward together with us, delivering a better railway for our passengers.” \nSouthern said it will run more than 70% of its trains next Monday – 10% more than it operated on previous conductor strike days. \n“This follows the completion by Southern … of its programme to put drivers in sole control of the operation of the train, including closing the doors, on nearly 80% of routes and the transfer of many conductors to the new onboard supervisor role focused exclusively on customer service,” said a statement. \nThe following routes – previously suspended on an RMT conductor strike day – will now operate on Monday: \nSouthern advised passengers to check its website for the latest information before they travel. Eastbourne – Hastings. Chichester – Portsmouth and Southampton. Lewes – Haywards Heath. Coastway stations (including Bognor, Littlehampton, Eastbourne, Worthing and Hastings) will regain a direct service to London. Routes which previously finished early in the evening will also now run later, and from Tuesday Southern plans to operate the normal full timetable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T12:38:19.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
