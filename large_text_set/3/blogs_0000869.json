There was thought the Jets may ask him to take a paycut.\nRevis, 31, was due a $2 million roster bonus March 10, so a decision had to be made before that cutoff.\n“I can’t thank Woody Johnson and the entire Jets organization enough for taking a chance on me back in 2007,” Revis, a seven-time Pro Bowler, said in a statement . “I played some of my greatest football in green and white. Jet nation has always been behind me and teammates. Without all of you there would be no Revis Island. I love you New York ”\nRevis, whom the Jets brought back in 2015 after they traded him in 2013, had suggested he could switch to safety, which would be easier for a slowing player.
