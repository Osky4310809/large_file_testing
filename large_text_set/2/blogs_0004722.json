Steve Bannon profile \nM r Trump has become increasingly frustrated over reports suggesting Mr Bannon is the power behind the throne, with the New York Times bearing the brunt of many of his attacks. \nOn Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted: \"The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!\" The failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2017 \nH e continued the attack on Monday, saying : \"The failing @nytimes was forced to apologise to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!\" \nHours earlier, he said: \"I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\" I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \nT hat early morning tweet came shortly after Joe Scarborough, whose MSNBC morning show the president is known to watch, suggested “maybe Bannon’s calling all the shots”. \nThe former head of the right-wing Breitbart News website, Mr Bannon's profile has been rising steadily since he became involved in Mr Trump's presidential campaign in August. \nHe recently appeared on the cover of Time magazine, catching the eye of Mr Trump, \"who takes pride in his own cover appearances and inquired about Bannon’s Time debut with aides,\" the Washington Post reported.
