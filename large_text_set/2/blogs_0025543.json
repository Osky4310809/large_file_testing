These boys have got a new boss (Photo: Valerio Pennicino) Diego Lopez will forever be remembered as the coach who outlasted Zamparini (Photo: Claudio Villa) \nBecause amazingly, Zamparini has made ELEVEN coaching changes in the last two seasons alone. \nWhen he took over the club back in 2002 they were in Serie B, but after promotion in the 2003/04 season he became renowned for hiring and firing more so than anything else. \nAnd after his most recent appointment of Diego Lopez last month, he's decided to call it a day and make way for a new Anglo-American fund to take over. Zamparini (right) used won't be shaking the hands of any more new arrivals soon (Photo: Tullio M. Puglia) \n\"The objective of the investors is to return the club to the position the city deserves, and European football within a three to five year program,\" read a club statement. \nAnd presumably sack less managers.
