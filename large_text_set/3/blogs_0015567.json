At the time, Jennifer Herrema and Neil Haggerty didn’t have any plans to continue working together beyond that, but a few other gigs later, Consequence Of Sound is now reporting that the band will actually be putting out a new, full-length album later this year called Platinum Tips And Ice Cream . It was apparently recorded over the course of two days and features “live and unrehearsed” version of older Royal Trux songs, including “Blue Is The Frequency,” “Sewers Of Mars,” and “The Banana Question.” \nPlatinum Tips And Ice Cream will be the group’s first new album since Pound For Pound in 2000, and it will be available on June 16. You can see the full track list at that Consequence Of Sound link up above, and the album art is below.
