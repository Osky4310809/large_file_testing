Gerrard and Lampard never truly clicked for England (Photo: The FA via Getty) \n“I’d pick them both,” said Redknapp, who turned 70 this month. “Why shouldn’t Barkley play in the same team as Alli? He’s 6ft tall, incredible build, and Dele Alli’s 6ft-plus, so we’re not talking about tiny little kids with no strength who can’t tackle and can’t defend. \n“Play your best players, find a way to include them in the England team, don’t fish for excuses to leave them out. \n“The pair of them can run all day, they can pass the ball, they can head it, they can shoot, they are box-to-box midfield players – they have got everything. Alli is a key man for England already (Photo: Reuters) \n“A few years ago we had Gerrard and Lampard, and it was only that people weren’t clever enough to get the best out of them. \n“OK, if you want a bit of insurance, you sit someone in between those two, you let them go higher up the pitch, arriving in the box – bang! What a fantastic pair. \n“Frank was getting 20 goals from midfield every year – if you get a striker who scores 20 in a season now it’s a miracle, isn’t it? Barkley is finding form again this term (Photo: Getty) \n“The other week I watched Manchester City play Tottenham, and when I looked at City’s team I thought, ‘Hang on, what are they doing? They are all fantastic footballers, but they haven’t got a ‘dog’ in midfield – who’s going to hold?’ \n“But they murdered Tottenham that day, they were absolutely fantastic – because they had people who can play. Too often we get blinded by the idea that you’ve got to have a holding midfielder, you’ve got to have a defensive anchor. \n“OK, so Chelsea have got the boy (N’Golo Kante) who sits in – but why can’t England play Barkley and Alli together?” \nRedknapp insists he is not bitter about missing the boat with England. But he would surely have gone further at major tournaments than Hodgson and lasted more than Sam Allardyce’s 67-day reign.
