Ecstatic. Exhausted. \nDonnellan’s face after the match told two tales. The first was of jubilation. After all, this was Fremantle’s first AFLW win. \nBut belying that joy was a sense of relief. Fremantle had entered the season as favourites. And in that respect they had failed dismally. \nFremantle coach Michelle Cowan shared the same emotions, and singled out Donnellan for her inspirational performance. \nThe Fremantle skipper — affectionately known as “Juddy”— kicked the sealer and put the game beyond doubt with only minutes remaining in the final term. It was the icing on top of a mouth-watering performance. \n“It’s reward for all of the effort the girls have put in right from the start of the preseason in November,” Cowan told Fox Footy . \n“They’ve had a draw, they’ve had a one-point (loss). And now, to get the taste of victory, I reckon they’ll want to taste that a lot more as well. \n“It was really lead from the front by the captain. A sensational effort by her today. \n“She had close to 10 tackles, 14 contested possessions. She’s a fabulous leader and certainly sets the benchmark for the competition.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T16:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T11:28:37.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
