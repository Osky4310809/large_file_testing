We suggest booking your trip for March, when you can catch Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone In Concert —live screenings of the movie accompanied by a live orchestra in Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow, Leeds, and Manchester.\nBut Harry Potter isn’t the only novel getting a special celebration this year. In fact, Visit England has declared 2017 the “Year of Literary Heroes,” partly in recognition or the 200th anniversary of Jane Austen’s death. There are plenty of Austen-related events taking place beginning in March 2017, including special tours, concerts, and a downloadable sculpture trail bringing visitors around Basingstoke (the birthplace of the author) to check out 25 BookBenches designed by different artists.\n\nAlso being celebrated during this year-long literary celebration: the 75th anniversary of “The Famous Five” by Enid Blyton, the 100th anniversary of poet Edward Thomas’ death, the 125th anniversary of the first Sherlock Holmes publication, and the 125th anniversary of the death of Lord Tennyson.\nFor a full list of those being honored and the year’s events, head to the Visit Britain’s website .\nThis article originally appeared in Travel & Leisure .\nRelated Links \nThe 17 best books to bring on vacation, based on where you’re traveling \nYou can now write in Mark Twain’s personal library \nBook lovers: Add this 100-year-old theater to your bucket list \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T20:07:14.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
