She ain’t throw you some bad thots?” \nOf course, the Instagrammable moment feels too good to be true — because it isn’t true. \nThe actual video was taken sometime last fall when Meek was listening to The Notorious B.I.G.’s “My Downfall,” an ominous record from his final album, Life After Death, which detailed haters going to extreme measures to knock him off his spot in the rap game — and worse. \nAs for Remy Ma’s accusations, both Trey Songz and Old Man Ebro have publicly denied involvement with Nicki’s “box,” so the validity of the record is already being called into question just 24 hours into its existence. \nAs of press time, Meek has yet to respond or react to the “SHETHER” record but his social media (via Snapchat) has been very active. Over the weekend, he got into a verbal altercation with a host of female fans after he refused to take a picture with them and received backlash on Twitter for having a homeless man do push-ups before he could receive a donation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:08:56.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
