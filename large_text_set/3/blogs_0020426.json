It’s independence. That will always come first and always has,” she said. \nIn last June’s Brexit referendum, about 62 percent of Scottish voters backed the UK remaining in the EU. \nThe SNP manifesto said they would hold another ballot on independence if there was a “material change in circumstances” after the first referendum in 2014. They now say Scotland is being removed from the EU against its wishes. \nHowever, Scottish voters’ support for staying in the UK is the highest it’s been in two and a half years, a poll has revealed. \nAccording to a YouGov survey published by The Times last week, first minister Nicola Sturgeon would have to close a 14-point gap to win an independence referendum. \nThe poll found that, after “don’t knows” and those who won’t vote were excluded, 57 percent of voters want to remain part of the UK and 43 percent want independence. \nYouGov recorded a 14-point lead for Scotland staying in the UK in August of 2014, a month before the first independence referendum was held.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:00:43.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
