He arrived with an ankle problem before encountering a shoulder injury in 2015. \nConsequently, Thomas has been judged negatively due to the contract and the expectations that accompanied it. \n“I just don’t think his football is what it has been and when you get comments about how good he was in 2011, you realised that’s actually six years ago and a lot of things have changed since then,” Dal Santo said. \n“He’s not playing great footy — simple as that. Whether you like him or not, it’s just not up to the standard of what we’ve come to expect.” \nLIVE stream every game of every round of the 2017 Toyota AFL Premiership Season on FOX SPORTS.
