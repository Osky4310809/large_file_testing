Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJamie Vardy has been branded a “cheat” by Samir Nasri, who admits he tried to confront the striker after Leicester ’s dramatic Champions League victory. \nNasri, on loan at Sevilla from Manchester City, was furious following his red-card for a head-butt aimed at striker Vardy during the second half of Tuesday night’s thriller. \nThe Foxes went on to beat the 10-men 2-0 — enough to secure their place in the quarter-final draw on Friday morning. \nNasri said of the England international: “For me, he is a cheat. The two players go nose to nose... (Photo: Sportimage) ...Vardy reels backwards, though Nasri denies making contact...

He was the one who came to my face, and then went on the floor. He played it well. \n“I didn’t touch him. I didn’t do anything with my head. \n“I would love to speak to him but, you know, too many cameras, too many security — and I have to think about next year and not getting a big suspension.” \nThe pair tangled with just under 20 minutes left in the game. \nNasri, already on a booking, leaned his head into Vardy’s and was shown a second yellow after the striker recoiled on contact. The incident rumbled on after Nasri's dismissal...

You are not better than us but you are winning 2-0, you will qualify, just play the game. You have quality, you are an international player, you don’t need to do that. \n“I think it started with a foul or something. Then he pushed me and I said, ‘What are you doing?’ Then he came in my face. That’s what happened. \n“I was surprised but, like I said, I should have thought about it and not reacted.
