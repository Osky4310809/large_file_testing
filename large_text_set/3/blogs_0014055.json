By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 14, 2017 12:42 PM A petition has been filed to make Shashi Tharoor UPA’s PM candidate for 2019 Lok Sabha elections. (Source: PTI) \nWhen the counting of votes for 5 state assemblies ended on Saturday evening, Congress was wiped out by BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Despite forming an alliance with Samajwadi Party, Congress managed to win just 7 seats in the state which was even less than Apna Dal’s 9 seats. However, the top leaders took some motivation from an overwhelming performance in Punjab and also looked at Manipur and Goa as it finished as the single largest party in both the states. \nComes 14th March and the things are looking all gloomy for the party as BJP has claimed to form the government in both the states. One of the major reasons behind this is believed to be Rahul Gandhi ’s failure to emerge as a leader of masses and compete against Narendra Modi . Today, Congress MLA Vishwajit Rane said party’s decision-making was slow in Goa. He said it was a failure on part of Congress leadership which shows that voices have started raising within the party. \nYou may also want to watch: \nEven though the party is still backing RaGa to come good, supporters have started to look for other options. A petition filed by a Thiruvananthapuram-based user is asking Shashi Tharoor to be named as UPA’s Prime Ministerial candidate for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The petition described him as, “Tharoor is a man well qualified with deep knowledge of international and national issues, who can connect with the people of India and with world leaders.” \n“We nominate Dr Shashi Tharoor to be the Prime Ministerial candidate of UPA in the run up to 2019. In the best interest of the World’s Largest Democracy and to rejuvenate the opposition,” the user said in his petition and has got over 8,000 signatures so far. He has been one of the most vocal Congress leaders in the recent past and was India’s most followed politician on Twitter until 2013 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi surpassed him. \nYou may also want to watch: \nHowever, the 61-year-old former diplomat has had his fair share of controversies. In 2009, he was accused of staying in luxurious 5-star hotels on government money, he then publicly criticised the new visa guidelines adopted by the Indian government, attacked Nehru for his vision on Indian foreign policy by the Indian media and last year, he made news by comparing JNU’s Kanhaiya, a student charged with sedition, with Bhagat Singh. So, while Congress supporters may feel that he could be the man to defeat Modi, the road isn’t going to be easy and certainly shows the lack of leaders in the party.
