Apps meant that developers could create their own iPhone-accessible software and put it out there for people to use, and users could download extra functionality and games for their phones. \nNow apps allow us to do… well, pretty much anything: book a taxi, order a pizza, edit a photo, download music, stream TV, and catch virtual Pokemon.

The iPhone 4 brought the front-facing camera to smartphones in 2010, accounting for the majority of the photos currently clogging up your Instagram. \n3) Emojis \nEmoticons were always a thing, but Emoji took the art of sending smiley faces to another level. The ever-expanding set of Unicode chracters was named in 2015 as the fast growing language in the world, allowing us to communicate in ways that words sometimes can't. (emojipedia) \n4) Full internet access \nRemember WAP? Waiting five minutes for a low-res version of MySpace or Google to load? The iPhone saw an end to that with a full mobile version of Apple’s Safari browser that meant you could do nearly everything you wanted to on the internet. \nIt also changed the way the web was built – now most websites are designed in mobile-responsive code to fit the size of your screen, and Adobe Flash (famously not supported by Apple) has hugely decreased in prevalence. \n5) GPS maps \nThe arrival of GPS technology crossed with the arrival of apps meant never getting lost again. The Google Maps app, and later Apple’s own Maps and Citymapper mean we always know where we’re meant to be going and exactly how to get there. iPhone marks 10th anniversary \n6) Autocorrect \nBack in the pre-iPhone days, you had to press the #1 key three times to type a ‘C’. Nowadays we jab vaguely on a digital QWERTY keyboard, and autocorrect takes care of the rest – 90% of the time typing exactly what we intended, and 10% of the time giving us embarrassing gaffes sure to go viral online. \n7) Finger-accurate touch screens \nTouch screens were around back when the iPhone was first announced, but they often required a stylus to be used effectively and accurately. Steve Jobs was keen to stress the quality of the finger-activated multi-touch screen at the iPhone launch. Now the stylus in Apple’s tablet range is an artist’s design implement to be used on the tooled-up iPad Pro. Five things to know about the new iPhone 7 \n8) Instant music access \nThe arrival of iTunes on PC and Mac was a huge moment in music downloads – and the iPhone only increased the ability to instantly hear the latest songs. The iTunes Store app meant that iPhone users could download songs straight to their phone without the need to plug it into their computer first, while the Spotify app and Apple Music mean subscribers can listen to any song, anywhere. \n9) Apple Pay \nIt’s not been around for long, but the Apple Pay system is already looking like it could be a catalyst to the world becoming cash-free. iPhone owners who connect their bank card to their mobile can pay for TfL travel and shopping by waving their handset in front of a contactless pay point.
