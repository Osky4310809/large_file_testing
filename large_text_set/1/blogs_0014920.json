Unreal. So embarrassing. It's 30 seconds.\n— Sam Blum (@SamBlum3) January 18, 2017 \nThe two teams played a back-and-forth first half before Siena went on a 15-0 run in the opening minutes after halftime to seize a 63-49 advantage they would never relinquish.\nThings got testy with 2:03 to play when a fight broke out involving Siena's Marquis Wright and Rider's Anthony Durham. Siena coach Jimmy Patsos and Rider coach Kevin Baggett then got into it, with Baggett ultimately attempting to walk into the Saints' huddle and having to be forcibly restrained by his assistants.\n\nICYMI: here's video of Anthony Durham of Rider punching Siena's Marquise Wright in the face. Wow. What a sequence to end the game tonight. pic.twitter.com/jJuyZASliU \n— Zach Bye (@byesline) January 18, 2017 Here's Rider head coach Kevin Bagget going face to face with Siena coach Jimmy Patsos. pic.twitter.com/bwIg1ye0xs \n— Sam Blum (@SamBlum3) January 18, 2017 \nThe two players were ejected from the game and the two coaches were each dealt technical fouls.\nWith 10 seconds remaining in the game, Baggett called a timeout where it seems as though he instructed his players to walk off the court at the end of the game without shaking hands. The Bronco players followed their orders after the horn sounded, signifying a 78-68 Siena win.\nSiena wins 78-68. Rider walks off, no handhakes. Jimmy Patsos does the handshakes on his own, anyway. pic.twitter.com/iV4Ko2zmWo \n— Michael Kelly (@ByMichaelKelly) January 18, 2017 \nThe home crowd was not too pleased.\nAll hell has broken loose in Albany. Siena fans throwing stuff at Rider who refused to shake hands.\n— SienaSoup (@sienasoup) January 18, 2017 \nNone of this stopped Patsos from sticking to his own postgame handshake protocol.\nClassic video of Siena coach Jimmy Patsos shaking hands with air as Rider walks off without showing sportsmanship. pic.twitter.com/WHtmc9WTEq \n— Zach Bye (@byesline) January 18, 2017 \nThe MAAC is no stranger to conference beef, as this skirmish comes almost one year to the day that  Iona and Monmouth got into it at the end of a nationally televised Friday night game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:10:11.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
