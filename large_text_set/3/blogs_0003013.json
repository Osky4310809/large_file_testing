Resort home. \nOn Thursday, officials at Sea Island, which hosts the PGA Tour ’s RSM Classic each fall, organized a team match that included Tour winners, up-and-coming players and those working to make it to the big leagues. \nThe field included Harris English, Hudson Swafford, Brian Harman , Patton Kizzire, Bobby Wyatt, Corey Whitsett and J.T. Poston, who posted the day’s best round (64) and was a perfect 3-0 paired with English. \nThe event, which was organized to keep players competitive during an off week, featured front- and back-nine matches between four teams for a total of 12 points. \nThe team that included English, Swafford and Whitsett – which was led by their manager Jeremy Elliott with Lagardere Sports – won the competition, 9-3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T06:44:48.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
