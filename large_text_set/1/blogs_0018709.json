Trump reeinstates Mexico City policy \nUnder the rule, no US government funding for family planning services can be given to clinics or groups that offer abortion services or counselling in other countries even if the funds for those activities come from non-US government sources. \nIt has been called the Mexico City Policy because it was unveiled at a UN conference there in 1984 and became one of the centrepiece social policies of the conservative administration of President Ronald Reagan. \nCritics call it the \"gag rule\" because it also cuts funds to groups which advocate or lobby for the lifting of abortion restrictions, so they say it infringes on free speech. Barack Obama moves to protect funding for abortion clinics from attack by Donald Trump's Republicans \nWhat happened in the past? \nThe policy has become a partisan \"tit for tat\" depending on which party occupies the White House. Support for abortion rights is a central plank of the Democratic Party while abortion rights opponents, many of whom are conservative Christians, comprise a key Republican base. \nFormer President Bill Clinton rescinded the rule when he took office in January 1993. \nGeorge W. Bush reinstated it on Jan 22, 2001, in one of his first policy moves as president, saying: \"It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad.\" Barack Obama then lifted it again on 23 January 2009.
