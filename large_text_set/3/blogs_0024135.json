Stare at boobs \nIt may seem like an inconvenience, or an invasion of privacy, to many women but staring at boobs creates a positive mindset in men.\nThe same effect occurs when they look at cute animals.\nA 2012 study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, looked at the effects positive thinking had on men’s health.\nAfter a year, positive thinking had a powerful effect on health choices.\nMore than half of the patients with coronary artery disease increased their physical activity versus 37 percent in the control group, who were not asked to write down positive thoughts in the morning.\nThe same happened in men with high blood pressure.\nMore than 40 percent of those with high blood pressure followed their medication plan compared to 36 percent in the non-positive thinking group.\n2. Have lots of sex \nWhat every man wants to hear, but there is a good reason for it.\nA study in the BMJ found sex could decrease a man’s mortality rate by as much as 50 percent.\nIt is all down to sex promoting physical well-being, as well as being a stress reliever – which can help reduce the likeliness of illness.\nNot to mention sex releases serotonin, the happy hormone, which makes us feel better overall.\nIn the study, life expectancy increased by three to eight years in the group who reported more orgasms.\n3. Get married \nNot something everyone would have thought – especially those who refer to their wife as their “ball and chain”, but married men do live longer.\nBut it also depends on the age they get married.\nA survey or more than 127,000 Americans found men who got married after they were 25 were likely to live longer than those who married young.\nResearchers have questioned whether healthy men are more likely to marry than men with health problems, but unhealthy men actually marry earlier, are less likely to divorce, and more likely to remarry after divorce or being widowed than healthy men.\nOthers have wondered whether living with another person has health benefits.\nBut it seems to be both.\n4. Have kids \nIt seems like a natural progression, really.\nMen who marry and have kids live longer than those who don’t.\nA study in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health found that when parents reached age 60, the difference in life expectancy was two years for men and 1.5 years for women.\nBy the age of 80, men with kids were expected to live eight months longer than those without kids.\nResearchers pondered whether those without kids lived an unhealthier lifestyle than those with kids.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:42:53.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
