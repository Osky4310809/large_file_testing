Unfortunately, death is guaranteed in this lovely thing called life. \nThe only way to correctly send off the beautiful souls who have left us is to give them the funeral, or celebration of life, they would have wanted. Giphy \nThat’s precisely why, when one Taiwanese politician died, his brilliant son decided to hire a gang of strippers to dance around on top of bright-colored Jeeps during the funeral procession. \nI’m sure he would have arranged the Jeeps to circle the actual burial ceremony if he could. \nHere’s a glimpse from the video clip above. YouTube \nTung Hsiang, the 76-year-old Taiwanese official, apparently received the funeral procession to match his vibrant personality. \nLet’s see… So, he had a total of 50 strippers dancing on top of colorful Jeeps equipped with stripper poles. Damn, his personality must have been raunchy as fuck, huh? \nThe deceased politician’s brother Tung Mao-hsiung spoke to local reporters, saying, \nHe told us he wanted this through a dream two days before the funeral. \nWait, so, the man never actually stated he wanted 50 strippers dancing on top of Jeeps during his funeral procession? Instead, someone in his family had “a dream” he wanted this? Amazing. I am speechless. Giphy \nWhile it seem might seem pretty odd and highly inappropriate to have strippers dance at a funeral, this type of tradition is actually quite common in some parts of Asia. \nAs a matter of fact, Chinese officials put together a campaign back in 2015 to put an end to these flamboyant stripper shows at funerals while citing the tradition has “severely polluted the local cultural life.” Giphy \nI can see that… \nHiring strippers to dance at funerals is a tactic typically used to bring more attention to the funeral service. That also makes sense. \nRegardless of how you feel about funeral strippers, this man’s thoughtful son did what he had to do for his dad. Rest in peace, Mr. Tung Hsiang. \nCheck out the video above! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
