This comes a week after announcing a self-serve platform that should make these emoji campaigns accessible to a broader range of businesses. \nCEO Michael Africk said that over the past few years, he‚Äôs seen a ‚Äúgold rush‚Äù of other companies moving into branded emojis. (In fact, the social media platforms have started to do something similar themselves .) \nThe difference, he said, is that Inmoji is actually collaborating with marketers to figure out what they‚Äôre trying to accomplish and how to achieve those goals through interactive emojis. So a movie studio could run a campaign where potential moviegoers could tap on an emoji, revealing a trailer and local showtimes. Or a coffee chain‚Äôs emoji could open up into a map of nearby stores. \n‚ÄúThese are really media units,‚Äù said COO Perry Tell (who co-founded Inmoji with Africk). ‚ÄúThis is not just a piece of licensed content ‚Äî these are new forms of advertising media.‚Äù \nTell and Africk noted that this interactivity also allows Inmoji to track whether the campaign is actually leading to the desired user behavior. In fact, the company says its campaigns have an engagement rate of 100 percent (which seems impossible until you realize that a user can interact with an emoji more than once). \nInmoji comes embedded with some messaging services, including Oovoo and Badoo, and it can also be added to Apple‚Äôs iMessage through a user download. Advertisers that have run Inmoji campaigns include Starbucks, Interscope and Disney. \nUntil now, those advertisers have worked directly with the Inmoji team to create those campaigns. Now businesses can use the platform themselves through a self-serve model ‚Äî Tell said this should help Inmoji reach ‚Äúa lot of small businesses that don‚Äôt have seven-figure, six-figure advertising budgets,‚Äù but as well as larger brands that already have a clear strategy and don‚Äôt need any handholding. \nAs for the new funding, it comes from John Wigneswaran (who previously invested ) and a group from MIT‚Äôs Sloan business school. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:14:20.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
