ADVERTISEMENT \nAsked if all or only some of the House leaders would be replaced, Alvarez said: “I already entrusted the matter to Majority Leader [Rodolfo] Fariñas.” \nOn Thursday, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, a leader of an opposition bloc, reproached the House leadership for apparently softening its threat of reprisal against lawmakers who voted against the administration measure restoring the death penalty. \n“The threat of Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez to oust those who would vote against the death penalty bill from their key leadership positions has turned out to be a mere scheming braggadocio,” he said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:49:09.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
