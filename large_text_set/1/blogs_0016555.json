Romelu Lukaku celebrates after he puts Everton ahead at Goodison Park \nMore pertinently for City fans, the result sees them sit an imposing 10 points behind leaders Chelsea in fifth place, while Everton remain in seventh, but have opened up a four-point cushion over West Brom in eighth. \nNew signing Morgan Schneiderlin had to make do with a place on the bench, but Everton didn’t need him early on as they had the better of the opening exchanges.

Ronald Koeman called his side's performance 'outstanding' as they saw off Manchester City 4-0 in the Premier League \nRaheem Sterling was incredulous two minutes later as he felt he was brought down in the box by Joel Robles as the City forward tried to take the ball round Everton’s ‘keeper, but referee Mark Clattenburg waved away his appeals. \nDavid Silva then went clean through in the 27th minute, but took too long to get his shot away, allowing Robles to force him away from goal, before plenty of defenders got back to snuff out the danger. Claudio Bravo fails to prevent Lukaku giving Everton a 1-0 lead \nThen, as Everton grew into the game again, a wonderful pass from Davies opened up the City backline to allow Lukaku to break the deadlock. Claudio Bravo was signed for his passing - but his shot-stopping is becoming a concern for City \nThe Toffees youngster’s pass into the path of Mirallas was inch perfect, Mirallas picked out his fellow countryman Lukaku, who rifled past Claudio Bravo from the edge of the box. \nCity almost responded in perfect fashion, as Sergio Aguero almost made contact with a low cross, before Sterling skimmed the top of the crossbar from the edge of the box moments later. Pep Guardiola appears dejected on the touchline with his team 2-0 down \nHowever, City were caught ball watching just after the break, and their static defending was punished as Mirallas doubled Everton’s advantage. \nYaya Toure’s loose pass was picked up by Lukaku, who fed Ross Barkley, who in turn squeezed the ball through for Mirallas, allowing the Belgium international time to drill the ball past Bravo and into the bottom corner. \nSchneiderlin came on to make his Everton debut just after the hour mark to shore things up for the hosts, but City rarely offered a great deal of threat in attack. Mirallas doubles Everton's lead with a low drive \nAnd, as City committed more bodies forward, 18-year-old Davies capped a fine performance with a well-taken third , which Lukaku did he best to steal on the line. \nAguero did force Robles into a fine stop minutes later, but City didn’t deserve anything for their lack of endeavour, and the result was made all the emphatic in stoppage time, as Lookman sent Goodison Park into raptures with a dream goal on his Everton bow, firing through Bravo's legs after poor defending from John Stones, to pile the pressure on Guardiola. \nPlayer ratings Mirallas and Lukaku speak with Ronald Koeman during a break in play \nEverton: Robles (7), Holgate (7), Williams (7), Funes Mori (7), Coleman (7), Davies (9), Barry (8), Baines (7), Barkley (6), Mirallas (7), Lukaku (8). \nSubs: Schneiderlin (7), McCarthy (6), Lookman (7).
