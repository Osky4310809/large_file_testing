Since the winter break, he has featured for only 29 minutes.

That is leading to repetitive muscle injuries, which have unfortunately been regular occurrence during his career. \nDortmund and Gotze will now be working extensively working with doctors and nutritionists, in a bid to get him fit and available for action again. \nSporting director Michael Zorc said: “We’re happy to have now uncovered the reasons for Mario’s difficulties and are convinced that his extraordinary abilities will give us additional quality once he has completely recovered from this. \n\"Mario has the full backing and maximum support of everyone at BVB during his recovery.\" poll loading Will Mario Gotze be a success back at Borussia Dortmund? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:00:13.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
