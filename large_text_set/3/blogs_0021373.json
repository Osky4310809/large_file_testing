Pubs and Bars Londoners campaign Fuller's to rebuild stage at live music pub the Half Moon \nThe Half Moon built its reputation on its live music – with gigs from the likes of U2, The Police and La Roux Tuesday 21 March 2017 10:45 GMT Click to followES Going Out It's back: Well-loved Herne Hill pub Half Moon reopens after flooding three years ago Fuller's \nCampaigners today vowed to fight for the return of live music to a historic venue where stars including U2 , Frank Sinatra and La Roux performed after its conversion into a gastropub and boutique hotel. \nThe Half Moon in Herne Hill reopened this week, three and a half years after it closed when it was badly flooded by a burst water main. \nLandlord Fuller’s, which took over the pub 15 months ago, has restored it but without keeping the performance space — which also hosted Eric Clapton , The Police, Paloma Faith , and Gavin Rossdale in the pub’s more than 40 years as a music venue. \nThe Save the Half Moon Campaign fought to retain the site as a pub, and today said it would continue to push for live music to be staged there. “It’s very sad what has happened considering the history, and it will never be the same again, but we definitely think it can still be a pub with live music,” said the group’s spokesman Peter Blair. The Half Moon pub is to open again after three years shut \n“We are in a dialogue with Fuller’s to see if an 80-capacity function room it has put in the pub can regularly host music. It would be criminal not to look to put something in place to restore the real music culture that the pub had.” \nCampaigners had amassed a 7,000-signature petition to save the Half Moon , which dates back to 1760. It has a rich history in the south London music scene and was where Island Records founder Chris Blackwell first met U2 and saw them perform. Transformed: the Half Moon in Herne Hill during the 2013 flood (John Nguyen/JNVisuals) \nGrammy award-winner La Roux, real name Elly Jackson, called it “an important place to many young musicians”, adding: “It will never be the Half Moon without live music. I certainly won’t be going there.” \nBush frontman Rossdale, a judge on TV show The Voice, said he played his first gig there, and Frank Sinatra reportedly did an impromptu performance while visiting his chauffeur. Singer Rumer not only performed but worked there. Plans to redevelop the pub were approved in April last year by Southwark council. A dining area and kitchen has opened in what was the live music space. The venue has been returned to a former use as a hotel, with 12 bedrooms — named after 12 people who walked on the moon — upstairs. Victorian features have been restored. The best craft beer pubs in London The best craft beer pubs in London 1/20 The Old Red Cow \nSmithfield A hefty range of interesting beers spans two bars at this Long Lane pub, with significantly more keg than cask on offer. Should the 10-15 on tap not suffice, there are countless more available in bottle. Decent pub grub also features, while the wine list is notably excellent by craft beer pub standards. 2/20 The Queen’s Head \nKing’s Cross Tucked away around the corner from the station, just off Gray’s Inn Road, this charming old pub does more than just good beer. On top of three rotating, interestingly stocked hand pumps and more taps it also offers more than 12 whiskies, several ciders, serves platters of cheeses and cured meats, and has board games galore. 3/20 The Earl of Essex \nIslington Around 18 beers feature at this pub near the Regent’s Canal, including many from local London breweries such as Beavertown and Redemption. The pub food menu, which comes with recommended beer pairings, is also decent. There’s a small but sweet beer garden to boot. 4/20 Crown and Anchor \nBrixton Set almost equal distance between Stockwell, Brixton and Oval, this pub offers 20-odd beers on keg and cask. The beers are eclectic, but south London brews feature particularly prominently. It’s fairly bustling of an evening, and you’ll also find a decent roast dinner. 5/20 The Understudy \nSouth Bank This relative newcomer from the National Theatre is the South Bank’s best pub bar none. Its package includes in excess of 10 beers on tap, a tank of ‘brewery fresh’ Meantime lager, a decent spirit, wine and cocktail offering, and some pretty sweet views over the Thames to boot. 6/20 Cock Tavern \nHackney Central Originally the home of Howling Hops brewery (before they outgrew the space and launched their own tank bar), this Hackney Central boozer is now home to Maregade Brew Co. . As well as serving their brews, it also specialises in great beer generally. More than 20 lines of it in fact, including a fair bit of Howling Hops stuff. Be aware that it’s cash only. 7/20 Old Fountain \nOld Street There’s usually upwards of 15 craft beers on the taps at this comfy (unless it’s rammed) Old Street boozer, and it has the added bonus of a rather nice terrace. A decent number of the beers available tend to be London brews, with Five Points, Hammerton and Kernel among the regulars. Looking for another point of difference? It has a fish tank. 8/20 The Southampton Arms \nKentish Town This pub set about equal distance between Gospel Oak, Tufnell Park and Kentish Town stations has resisted going too ‘craft’ despite stocking around 20 varieties just that — it still feels like a local boozer. There’s a particular prevalence of brews from London’s smaller breweries as well as those from around the UK, while fans of craft cider are also well catered for with five or six on tap at all times. 9/20 The Harp \nCovent Garden This characterful but cramped old pub a stone’s throw from Charing Cross station offers a rotating selection of 20 or so brews, main focusing on real ales. And as a regular CAMRA award winner, you can rest assured they’re in good condition. Only problem? It gets absolutely rammed. 10/20 Mother Kelly’s \nBethnal Green This Paradise Row beer bar from the team behind The Queen’s Head in King’s Cross has over 23 numbered taps which correspond to a changing selection of brews — like a Chinese restaurant for beer. It’s inspired by a New York taproom, so don’t expect a cosy pub — but if the weather’s nice, you can count on an outdoor barbecue and plenty of atmosphere on the terrace. 11/20 The Lyric \nSoho The best thing about this characterful pub near Piccadilly Circus is the way it merges the music, fun and frivolity you’d expect from a Soho boozer with a surprisingly stunning selection of beers — there’s never far off 20 on tap. Oh, and there are open fires. 12/20 Hack and Hop \nCity The latest pub from the team behind The Dean Swift and The Old Red Cow (also in this list), this decent-sized venue just off Fleet Street has more than a decent beer list — more than 20 split between cask and keg. There’s also a gastropub-style food menu, though that’s not what brings most people in. 13/20 The White Horse \nParson’s Green This west London institution — affectionately(ish) known as The Sloaney Pony due to its location and clientele — serves a lot of great British beer, but really comes into its own when it comes to foreign imports — particularly from Belgium, Germany and the USA. Options include Pilsner Urquell tank beer alongside eight hand pumps and around 10 taps, plus more than 130 bottles. The gastropub food is good quality and it boasts a particularly sizeable beer garden along with a calendar packed with beer festivals. 14/20 Euston Tap \nEuston Housed in a teeny stone building just in front of Euston station which was built in 1870 as a form of passenger information kiosk, the Euston Tap is not blessed when it comes to space. Neither is it in any way comfy. However, it does stock an impressive range of beers — 20 keg, 8 cask and 150 by bottle, to be exact. Those with an affection for apples should also check out sister site Cider Tap across the road. 15/20 Dean Swift \nBermondsey A rotating selection of more than 15 cask and keg beers are almost always available at The Dean Swift. What makes the place particularly great is that despite this great beer selection, and some very good Sunday roasts served upstairs, it maintains a real ‘local boozer’ vibe. 16/20 The Fox \nHaggerston This east London longtimer offers a regularly-changing selection of between 15 and 20 beers on tap at all times, plus some very decent booze-absorbing pizzas. Brews from London makers such as Kernel, Beavertown and Pressure Drop tend to get top billing alongside plenty of international offers. There’s a beer garden out back, too. 17/20 Cask Pub & Kitchen \nPimlico There’s a constantly changing selection of 25 beers on tap at this tucked-away Pimlico pub, not to mention multiple fridges full of interesting bottles. It’s the original from the group behind the Craft Beer Co chain, and we reckon it’s still the best. 18/20 Craft Beer Co \nVarious locations The original Clerkenwell branch of this mini-chain was one of the first proponents of craft beer in London. It’s still going strong, while there are now also sites in Brixton, Islington, Clapham, Covent Garden and the City. The Islington branch, which comes with a large beer garden and comfier seating, is a favourite. 19/20 BrewDog \nVarious locations You’ll no these guys. They do beer for punks, apparently. Whatever you make of BrewDog’s marketing gimmicks, they make some bloody good beer. Find it at their bars in Camden, Clapham Junction, Clerkenwell, Angel, Shepherd’s Bush, Shoreditch and Soho, along with plenty of guest beers from other brewers. The Shepherd’s Bush branch usually has the biggest selection of beers, totalling more than 30. 20/20 Draft House \nVarious locations The Draft House group is far removed from the kind of minimalist, vaguely uncomfortable craft beer pub where it’s all about beer. Expect quirky design, good music and burgers, hot dogs and pub staples served throughout the day. Find sites in Battersea, Fitzrovia, Hammersmith, Tower Bridge, the City and Bethnal Green. drafthouse.co.uk \nAn outbuilding called The Workshop, which has its own bar, is the area campaigners hope can host live music. \nJonathon Swaine, managing director of Fuller’s Inns, said: “The Half Moon has set a new standard, not just in Fuller’s but for the wider industry, in how to sympathetically refurbish a historic pub. It has a history and heritage that deserves to be recognised and res-pected and I truly believe we have succeeded in doing that.\" More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:57:17.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
