Because, honestly, what's not to love in a musical - you've got a thrilling story, you've got music, and you've got magic... it's beautiful. If you are as big a fan as we are, here are seven musicals that you can put on your binge watch list. 1. Beauty and the Beast \nReleasing in March this year, the Emma Watson remake of the iconic Disney cartoon, this version of Beauty and the Beast is a feminist , modern spin of the old tale, and honesty we cannot wait to watch it. 2. La La Land \nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone... you don't really need any more reasons to catch this film. Making a mark at the Oscars , this film is a perfect watch for a Saturday night with the girls. 3. The Sound of Music \nOne of the most epic musicals, the 1965 film is known for its peppy characters, engaging plotline and, not to forget, the unforgettable \"My Favourite Things\". It's a perfect pick-me up movie on a Hump Day. 4. My Fair Lady \nOur list would be incomplete without My Fair Lady . One of Audrey Hepburn's classic, based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion , the story of Eliza Doolittle and Professor Henry Higgins is a complete entertainer. 5. Chicago \nIf you are looking for some drama, Chicago is the perfect crime musical (and a dark comedy) exploring the hidden side of celebrities, scandals, and corruption in Chicago during the Jazz Age (the 1920s). Plus, it combines the charms of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renée Zellweger, and Richard Gere. 6. Moulin-Rouge \nThe 2001 Australian-American musical is the story of a young English poet who falls in love with Moulin Rouge's cabaret actress. If you haven't watched this already, stop everything and get your hands on it, NOW! 7. Mary Poppins \nWe've kept the best for the last. Over five decades old, the musical still manages to entertain us. It follows the story of Julie Andrews, aka Mary Poppins, who visits a dysfunctional family in London in order to help improve their lives. Total delight!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T10:44:13.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
