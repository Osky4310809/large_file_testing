This study assessed stigma and discrimination against MMT patients in the mountainous and rural areas in Vietnam and explored their associated factors to inform implementation strategies. Methods We interviewed 241 MMT patients in two clinics: one in Tuyen Quang Province’s inner city and the other in Son Duong District, to assess stigma and discrimination that patients perceived and experienced. Socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health status, and history of drug abuse were examined. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to explore factors associated with stigma and discrimination. Results The majority of respondents reported experiencing stigma and discrimination including blame/judgment (95.1%), shame (95.1%), disclosure (71.4%), and the fear of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission by others (74.1%). Unemployed patients were more likely to experience discrimination (Coef = −1.18, 95% CI = −1.87; −0.89). Those who were taking an antiretroviral were more likely to disclose their health status (Coef = 2.27, 95% CI = 0.6; 3.94). In addition, a higher likelihood of being blamed/judged and shamed was associated with those who suffered from anxiety/depression (Coef = 1.59, 95% CI = 0.24; 2.93 and Coef = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.36; 1.79, respectively). Conclusions MMT patients in these mountainous areas perceived high levels of stigma and discrimination which were associated with mental health disorders, unemployment, and HIV infection. These findings highlighted the importance of reducing drug use and HIV-related stigma against high-risk populations. Besides, psychosocial and familial supports, as well as job referrals, also play crucial roles in terms of promoting quality of life among MMT patients. Keywords Stigma Discrimination Methadone maintenance treatment Mountainous area Vietnam Background Illicit drug misuse is a major global public health issue. People who inject drugs (PWID) are more vulnerable to various factors including the transmission of infectious diseases [ 1 ]. In 2015, approximately 65% of all people living with HIV were PWID [ 2 ]. A study carried out in northern Vietnam also revealed significantly high prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among PWID (42.4, 80.9, and 74.1%, respectively) [ 3 ]. In response, Vietnam has shown vigorous efforts to reduce the number of drug users as well as the incidence of drug injection-related blood-borne diseases at both national and international levels. The methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program was first introduced in Vietnam in 1996–1997, and by 2012, 61 MMT clinics were available, providing treatment for 20 cities and provinces across the country [ 4 ]. In 2006, harm reduction programs were implemented in 21 provinces with various interventions including providing sterile syringes and condoms, changing behavior, and counseling [ 5 ]. Vietnam has committed that, by 2020, 90% HIV-positive people know their status, 90% of those diagnosed with HIV engage in antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of ART patients have durable viral suppression (“90-90-90” targets) [ 6 ]. Harm reduction services have shown promising results. For instance, the previous literature revealed that MMT could promote the quality of life, reduce the frequency of illicit drug use [ 7 ], and minimize HIV-related risk behaviors among illicit drug users [ 7 – 10 ]. Moreover, a needle exchange program (NEP) was effective in reducing blood-borne diseases [ 11 ]. However, these programs face formidable challenges partly due to high levels of stigma associated with drug use [ 12 ]. These hamper the effectiveness of drug treatment [ 13 ], limit the access to drug and HIV/AIDS treatment [ 14 ], negatively affect health status, and reduce treatment adherence [ 15 , 16 ]. Therefore, to maximize the effectiveness of harm reduction services, attention should be drawn to the prevalence of stigma and discrimination experience by drug users. Stigma and discrimination against most-at-risk populations have been studied in different health care settings in Vietnam [ 17 – 19 ]; very few studies, however, have drawn much attention to rural and mountainous areas where HIV has been increasingly prevalent [ 20 ]. This study, therefore, aims to examine stigma among MMT patients in mountainous areas in northern Vietnam. Methods Study setting and sampling method We conducted a cross-sectional study from May to August 2016 in Tuyen Quang Province. Two MMT clinics were involved in the study: one in Tuyen Quang City, a third-grade urban area, and the other in Son Duong District, a rural area. In fact, there are three MMT centers in Tuyen Quang Province; however, we excluded one, Yen Son District, because only nine patients have been treated in this clinic due to its new establishment. Methadone treatment in the two clinics is free of charge and funded by the Australian government and the Royal Dutch government. Apart from daily methadone treatment, patients also receive health counseling from health staffs working at these sites. The sample included patients taking MMT in the selected sites. The eligibility criteria included (1) taking or initiating MMT in the selected sites, (2) presenting at the clinics during the study period, (3) being 18 years old or above, (4) having the capacity to answer the questionnaire, and (5) agreeing to participate. We approached all patients who were at the clinics and introduced the study. Those who met the eligibility criteria were invited to enroll and gave written informed consent if they agreed to participate upon the understanding of the study’s purposes. Interviews were administered in a private room. The patients did not receive any compensation given that the medication was provided free of charge. A convenient sample of 241 patients was recruited in the study. The response rate was 80–90% across the two sites. Measurements and instruments Face-to-face interviews were conducted by well-trained interviewers including health staffs working at the Center for Preventive Medicine, Tuyen Quang Province, and master’s students of public health at Hanoi Medical University. Socioeconomic characteristics Socioeconomic characteristics included age, gender, education level, marital status, employment status, ethnicity, religion, and household monthly income. Household monthly spending was measured with two elements: recurring/regular expenditure (namely food, clothes, rent, utility, education) in the last 30 days and non-recurring/irregular expenditure (e.g., health care, furniture, occasions, travel, construction) in the last 12 months [ 21 , 22 ]. Health status Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured by using the EuroQol-five dimensions-five levels (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. The instrument comprises five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, with five levels of response: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. To compute those indexes, we employed the interim scoring for EQ-5D-5L from the cross-walk value set of Thailand due to the unavailability of the Vietnamese population’s preference [ 23 , 24 ]. The Vietnamese version of EQ-5D-5L was translated and adopted as well as validated elsewhere [ 24 , 25 ]. Furthermore, we also asked the patients about HIV status and acute and chronic illness. Illicit drug use and rehabilitation We collected the following information on the history of drug abuse and current drug abuse. Stigma/discrimination We referred to the Substance Abuse Self-Stigma Scale by Luoma et al. and measures of HIV-related stigma [ 26 ]. In addition, we adapted the conceptual framework by Parker and Aggleton to construct the measure of drug addiction-related stigma among MMT patients [ 27 ]. We then piloted the measures in drug users and people living with HIV/AIDS. The final measure of stigma included five dimensions: (1) blame/judgment, (2) shame, (3) discrimination in various settings (workplace, health care services, family, and community), (4) disclosure of addiction or health status (including HIV-positive if seropositive), and (5) others’ fear of HIV transmission among those patients who self-reported being HIV-positive [ 28 ]. The respondents were asked if they had experienced any of the above types of stigma within the last month with the response options ranging from 0 to 10 points, indicating “never experience” and “always experience,” respectively. We divided the score into three levels: 0 indicates “never experience,” 1 to 9 suggests “experience,” and 10 indicates “always experience.” The following are examples of the items included: 1. Have you recently been blamed or criticized because of your health status and drug use behaviors? Do you currently feel shame because of your health status and drug use behaviors? 3. Have you felt discriminated against or treated badly by others? In which circumstances (workplace/all health facilities/family/community/others)? 4. Have you ever disclosed your health status and drug use behaviors with others? With whom did you share? (For HIV positives) Has anyone expressed fear of contracting HIV from casual contacts with you? Statistical analysis Data was analyzed by using STATA software version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests were employed to measure the difference in levels of discrimination/stigma between the two study sites. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. In this study, a stepwise backward selection strategy was applied along with multivariate Tobit regression to have reduced models. This strategy uses a threshold with the log-likelihood ratio test to have predictors with p values <0.2 included. Results Table 1 provides the demographic information of the respondents. In total, 241 patients participated in this study; 167 patients were receiving MMT in Tuyen Quang, and 74 patients were receiving MMT in Son Duong. The most common ethnic group was Kinh (92.2%). The mean age was 40.4 years (SD = 7.49). The majority lived with a spouse or partner (62.3%). The percentage of patients who were self-employed was 47.5% and only 6.4% was unemployed.
