Houston came ready to play, and its defensive front – namely Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus – did a great job getting into the backfield and getting after the Patriots’ signal caller.\nAs is usually the case during games like this, Brady seemed a bit frustrated on the sidelines. So much so that he forgot his sense of decorum when his nose was a bit clogged and unleashed this hellacious snot rocket before heading into the locker room for halftime.\nThe more disgusting of the two involved clearing out his left nostril. Someone decided to put that in slow motion. Obviously, if you are grossed out by this sort of thing, you should not watch this, because it’s nasty.\nhttps://twitter.com/bterris/status/820461306734116864 \nSomeone get that man a tissue the next time he looks like he has a stuffy nose.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T05:25:29.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
