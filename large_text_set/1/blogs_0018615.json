I am a fan,however, to casseroles. When I saw this I had to give it a try. I loved it, as well as my husband and kids! The cheese and peppers and onions definitely make this recipe.\" MY REVIEW Melongal User ID: 1562774 242380 Reviewed Jan. 23, 2016 \n\"I took the advice of other posts, and every one asked for 2nds!! I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup , used 2/3 cup red pepper and left out the green pepper. I also added 4 oz of sour cream and 1/2 Cup of skim milk. Used 3/4 Cup of Colby Jack and 3/4 Cup of Sharp cheddar inside the casserole , and used about 1/3 of Cup each cheese on top. I also used wide egg noodles. I was asked for the recipe with my tweaks--definitely a \" comfort \" food!\" MY REVIEW myrakk User ID: 6683340 242002 Reviewed Jan. 18, 2016 \n\"I used turkey and it was a delicious casserole my husband loved it\" MY REVIEW dzickuhr User ID: 8680782 241602 Reviewed Jan. 12, 2016 \n\"I do not like red and green peppers so I used a bit less than recipe. Other than that followed the recipe and it was good! Not sure how it lacks flavor with peppers in it? I found it flavorful.\" MY REVIEW 56Teebird User ID: 7552813 240985 Reviewed Jan. 3, 2016 \n\"This looked so easy & good. I didn't have cream of chicken soup , so I used cream of mushroom-2 cans! I used rotisserie chicken . Had no green pepper, used all red. Had no monterey Jack, so I used Colby Jack and Chedder. i added a little extra mayo too. Was great!\" MY REVIEW cyber_2th_tigress@yahoo.com User ID: 1883306 240935 Reviewed Jan. 3, 2016 \n\"Made this recipe exactly how it is written, and when my husband took his first bite he looked at me dismayed and said \"you don't ever have to make this again!\" Lacks flavor. This recipe was a total waste of ingredients.\" MY REVIEW KathyCooks1943 User ID: 8651526 240921 Reviewed Jan. 3, 2016 \n\"Can't anyone make a wonderful casserole without CHEESE!!!! Seems like each and every casserole has a ton of cheese. I have nothing against cheese but every dish seems to taste the same.\" MY REVIEW Ozarkagirl User ID: 5881259 240914 Reviewed Jan. 3, 2016 \n\"This is a wonderful, comforting casserole dish to have on a cold evening. After the first time I made it I began adding 1/2 cup milk to the soup mixture so it wouldn't be as dry and a chopped celery rib because we like celery. My husband and kids love it. To cindihartline: if you want diet food, go to another site, It's obvious you haven't made this recipe and that's what a review is all about. You make it, then tell us your experience with it and what you think about it.\" MY REVIEW cindihartline User ID: 6608007 240894 Reviewed Jan. 2, 2016 \n\"Calories and fat, you crazy?\" MY REVIEW bbw1399 User ID: 8175280 240886 Reviewed Jan. 2, 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T08:13:38.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
