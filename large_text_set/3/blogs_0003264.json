(AP) By A.J. Cassavell / MLB.com | + 0 COMMENTS \nPEORIA, Ariz. -- With one sweet swing, Wil Myers offered a reminder as to why the Padres committed six years and $83 million to him this offseason. Myers' first home run of Spring Training came in the form of a fourth-inning no-doubter, propelling the Friars to a 5-0 win over the A's on Wednesday. \nChristian Bethancourt -- who is being converted into a catcher/reliever hybrid -- made his debut on the mound this spring and pitched a 1-2-3 eighth. He was one of seven Padres pitchers who combined to limit Oakland to two hits. Full Game Coverage \nA's ace Sonny Gray had a smooth first outing, striking out four over two innings. He allowed a leadoff double to Travis Jankowski , but retired the next six men he faced. Jankowski finished 2-for-3 with an RBI. \n\"It's been a long process,\" said Gray, who missed much of 2016 because of injuries, \"but I'm excited to feel good and excited to be out there.\" \nPadres debutant Trevor Cahill matched Gray with two scoreless innings of his own. Facing the team that drafted him, Cahill allowed only one walk and struck out three -- all looking at breaking balls. \nAlejandro De Aza and Khris Davis had hits for Oakland. Jabari Blash , meanwhile, walked and homered for the Friars -- his second blast in two days. \nAthletics Up Next: Right-hander Jesse Hahn , in competition for the fifth-starter spot, is set to make his second Cactus League start Thursday in a 12:05 p.m. PT matchup with the Rangers at Hohokam Stadium. In relief, several pitchers are scheduled to make their spring debuts, including prospect Frankie Montas and veterans Ryan Madson and John Axford . \nPadres Up Next: Christian Friedrich is sitting on the fringe of the Padres' rotation this spring. He gets his first chance to make a case for a starting spot when the Friars head to Scottsdale to face the D-backs at 12:10 p.m. PT. Kevin Quackenbush , Jon Edwards and Miguel Diaz -- who are competing for spots in the bullpen -- will also pitch. \nWatch every out-of-market regular-season game live on MLB.TV . covers the Padres for MLB.com.
