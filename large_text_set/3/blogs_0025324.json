Read More People flying to UK from these six countries will be BANNED from carrying laptops, iPads and Kindles in hand luggage \nThat’s going to have a pretty big impact on business travellers and holidaymakers who have planned their summer trip to Turkey, Egypt or Tunisia this year. \nBut it’s not just the risk that you’ll be forced to make small talk with the enthusiastic over-sharer in the seat next to you. There are hefty financial implications too. \nMost travel insurance policies demand that valuables such as jewellery and gadgets remain on your person while you fly – meaning in your hand luggage rather than your checked-in suitcase. \nSo if you have to leave them in your suitcase then you may not be protected in case of loss, damage or theft. But some insurers have agreed to relax their rules… as long as you take extra care of your case. Read More Will my insurer pay out if the gadget gets broken? Great on holiday - if it arrives unbroken (Photo: Apple) \nWe’ve all had that sinking feeling caused by sitting on a plane and watching a baggage handler throw your case into the hold like it’s a live shark he’s trying to stun. \nThat’s bad enough when it’s your souvenir snow globe but it’s even worse when it’s your iPad or phone or the laptop you’ve stuffed with film downloads. \nSadly, not all travel insurance policies cover gadgets and valuables in the hold and it’s really important you find out your insurer’s position before you wave your case goodbye. \n“Wherever possible travellers should keep valuables, including tablets and laptops, with them on flights and, if travelling from destinations affected by the new regulations, it may be sensible to leave valuables at home,” said Mark Shepherd from the Association of British Insurers. \n“If devices are damaged during a flight, there’s also the potential to seek compensation through the airline.” Switch on, damn you! (Photo: Getty) \nHowever, he urges travellers to give their insurer a ring before they go to see if they have cover, and make alternative arrangements if not. \n“Some travellers may find they also have additional cover under a household contents policy for gadgets outside of the home. We do know some insurers already take a flexible approach to claims if a passenger has been forced to put items in the hold by circumstances out of their control.” \nCertainly some of the larger insurers have already said they will cover some claims, although potentially only for travel plans that had been made before the ban was announced. \nAnd the extension of cover will only count for valuables checked into the hold on returning flights from the affected countries – not travel to the places in question, or to or from anywhere else. \n“Ordinarily, customers are not covered for carrying these items in the hold, as they fall within the definition of ‘valuables’,” said a spokesperson for Direct Line Travel Insurance. \n“However, we will consider claims whilst this advice remains in place for inbound flights from the six affected countries.” Check it out before you check it in What not to pack (Photo: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nDon’t assume the safest thing to do is pack all your gadgets and devices in your suitcase. \nMany insurers have issued rules for travellers who want to keep their items protected while they travel, and those rules could leave cautious travellers out of pocket. \nFor example, devices that are not restricted by the new ruling, such as smaller smartphones and cameras, will not be protected while in the hold. \nSo don’t put everything in your case ‘for safety’s sake’ because you could be risking a much more expensive bill to replace them. When a lock can save you £1,000 \nEven the insurers who are happy for customers to check their valuables into the hold will need to know there’s some protection in place – even if it’s just a lock. \n“Saga Travel Insurance customers travelling back from the countries in question will be covered for a maximum of £600 per item and an overall total of £1,000 as long as any item is placed in a locked suitcase,” said Kevin McMullan, head of Saga Travel Insurance. \n“Customers should ensure that items are adequately protected from damage and the airline should be notified of any loss or damage as soon as possible.\" \nIf you’re relying on your insurer for this cover then you need to check with them what counts as ‘adequately protected’. Some insurers may accept claims for damage if the suitcase itself was lockable, but reject claims when there was nothing but a small travel padlock securing the case – it’s better to find out in advance rather than wait until you need to claim. What if I don’t have luggage? 'I can definitely live out of this for a week' (Photo: Getty) \nLet’s face it, we Brits are masters of the cheap flight and many of us have perfected carrying everything we need for a 2-week break in our hand-luggage or stuffed into a coat far too big to be worn in the summer. \nBut this rule will mean many more of us have to pay to check a bag into the hold. Thomas Cook has already confirmed that they won’t be waiving the fee for checking a bag in and warned that passengers will need adequate insurance because the airline won’t cover any damage. \nSome airlines have increased the paid-for luggage allowance to reflect the fact that passengers will have no choice but to check in their electronics. Monarch, for example, has increased the hold luggage allowance by 3kg for its flights from Turkey. \nJet 2, Easyjet and British Airways have all warned customers flying from the countries in question that there are likely to be extra security checks as a result of these new rules, so it’s important to allow plenty of time before the flight. Don’t forget to charge smaller gadgets! Is it charged? (Photo: Getty) \nWith all this fuss about laptops and tablets it’s easy to forget the extra checks you may need to go through to get mobile phones and smaller gadgets on board. \nElectronic items should be fully charged as you go through security as you may be asked to turn them on to demonstrate they are working devices. The uninsurable risk \nOf course, a ban on tablets, e-readers and other larger gadgets means there are going to be a lot more bored children on affected flights this summer. \nAnd, sadly, there’s no insurance policy that can protect you (or their parents!) from that.
