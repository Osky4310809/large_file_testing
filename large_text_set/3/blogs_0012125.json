Bernstein/Reuters     03.57 GMT First published on   03.55 GMT \nTheir healthcare overhaul imperiled from all sides, the White House and top House Republicans acknowledged on Wednesday that they would make changes to the legislation in hopes of nailing down votes needed to pass the the party’s showpiece legislation soon. \nHouse speaker Paul Ryan declined to commit to bringing the measure to the House floor next week, a fresh indication of uncertainty. Republican leaders have repeatedly said that was their schedule, but opposition mushroomed after a congressional report concluded this week that the measure would strip 24 million people of coverage in a decade. \nRyan told reporters that he and the other Republican leaders could now make “some necessary improvements and refinements” to the legislation, reflecting an urgency to buttress support. Republican healthcare plan: 24 million people could lose coverage, CBO reports Read more \nThe measure would strike down much of former President Obama’s 2010 overhaul and reduce the federal role, including financing, for healthcare consumers and is opposed uniformly by Democrats. \nOn Wednesday night, Donald Trump told a rally in Nashville, Tennessee: “It’s going to be great”. \nHe added: “The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare [the Affordable Care Act], based on the principles I outlined in my joint address. Let me tell you, we’re going to arbitrate, we’re going to get together, we’re going to get something done. \n“Remember this. If we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we need 60 votes, so we’d have to get the Democrats involved. They won’t vote, no matter what we do, they’re not going to vote. So we’re doing it a different way, a complex way, it’s fine. The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three, it’s going to be great. And then we get on to tax reduction, which I like.” \nAt an all-hands meeting of House Republicans, vice-president Mike Pence and party leaders urged their rank-and-file to unite behind the legislation. \n“It’s our job to get it out of here and get it to the Senate,” Pence told the Republicans, according to congressman Dennis Ross of Florida. That would let Trump pressure “Democrats in these red states to come on board”, Ross said, referring to Republican-leaning states where Democratic senators face re-election next year. \nHealth secretary Tom Price was using phone calls to lobby Republican governors, some of whom oppose the bill’s phasing out of Obama’s expansion of Medicaid to 11 million lower-income Americans. \nAmid the maneuvering, a government report said that more than 12 million people have signed up for coverage this year under the very statute that Donald Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal. That figure underscored the potential political impact of the party’s next move. \nPence met repeatedly with House Republicans but rebels still abounded. Conservatives were unhappy the measure doesn’t erase enough of Obama’s law while at the other end of the party’s spectrum, moderates were upset the bill would strip millions of health coverage. \nConservatives want to end Obama’s expansion of Medicaid next year, not in 2020 as the bill proposes. They also say a tax credit to help people pay medical costs is too generous, and they want to terminate all of Obama’s insurance requirements, including mandatory coverage of specified services like drug counseling. healthcare \nMeanwhile, moderates in the same party feel the tax credits are too stingy, especially for low earners and older people. They oppose accelerating the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion and are unhappy with long-term cuts the measure would inflict on the entire program. \nTerminating the Medicaid expansion in 2020 and not 2018 “is sacrosanct to me,” said congressman Tom MacArthur of New Jersey. \nIn a new complication, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, said the measure lacked the votes to pass in the Senate, where Republicans hold a precarious 52-48 majority. That left House members angry over being asked to take a politically risky vote for legislation likely to be altered. \nModerates “don’t like the idea of taking a vote in the House that may go nowhere in the Senate”, said congressman Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. \nThe bill would enfeeble Obama’s individual mandate, the requirement that Americans buy coverage, by abolishing the tax fine on violators. It would end subsidies that help low-income people with high insurance premiums the most and replace them with tax credits that are bigger for older people. It would cut Medicaid, repeal the law’s tax increases on higher earning Americans and require 30% higher premiums for consumers who let coverage lapse. \nGOP support became scarcer when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the legislation would push 24 million Americans off coverage in a decade and shift out-of-pocket costs toward lower income, older people. That surpasses the 20 million who’ve gained Medicaid or insurance coverage under Obama’s law. \nHundreds of conservative activists rallied outside the Capitol in sub-freezing weather to call on congressional leaders and Trump to abandon the GOP bill and fully repeal Obama’s law. The rally was organized by FreedomWorks, a conservative group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. \nThe 2017 government sign-up numbers missed Obama’s target of 13.8 million people. Experts said the figures undercut Republican claims that the health law’s insurance markets are teetering toward collapse.
