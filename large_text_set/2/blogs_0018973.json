Valencia climb to 14th. 2 - El Real Madrid have conceded two goals in the first 10 minutes of a La Liga game for the first time since 2003 vs Sevilla. Siesta. â€” OptaJose (@OptaJose) February 22, 2017 \nZaza , who also scored in Sunday's 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, put Valencia ahead with only four minutes played, collecting Munir El Haddadi's cross with his back to goal before blasting an unstoppable shot on the turn into the top corner, with the recalled Keylor Navas only able to stand and watch. \nFive minutes later, a shell-shocked Madrid found themselves two behind. Raphael Varane was dispossessed in the Valencia half and the home side raced through on the break, with Nani sending Orellana into the box to slot through the legs of Navas. \nMunir saw an effort deflect over the crossbar, before James Rodriguez - who had kept his place in the starting line-up - almost squeezed Ronaldo's low cross over the line at the far post in a breathless opening 20 minutes. \nDiego Alves reacted brilliantly to keep Karim Benzema's dipping effort from creeping beneath the crossbar but he could do nothing to stop Ronaldo halving the deficit before the break as Madrid made their mounting pressure count. \nMarcelo was given time down the left to float a superb cross towards the penalty spot, where Ronaldo rose highest to power a header beyond Alves' right hand. 3 - Most headed goals in Europe's top 5 leagues in the last 10 seasons: CRISTIANO RONALDO 51", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:06:26.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
