WHAT ANTI-DOPING RULES ARE CITY ALLEGED TO HAVE BROKEN? \nIt is alleged by the FA that City contravened regulation 14(d) of their anti-doping rules. \nRegulation 14 stipulates that clubs under the FA's jurisdiction must maintain up-to-date records of training sessions, including start and end times and locations, as well as the current home or hotel address of its players. \nThis information should be regularly uploaded to a database which is accessed by anti-doping agents, who then visit training grounds to conduct tests. \nSection 14(d) of the governing body's code, which City have allegedly contravened, is explained thus: \n\"It shall also be a breach of this Regulation 14 by the Club if the information contained in such reports is either initially inaccurate or has not been updated by the Club as necessary to ensure it remains accurate.\" \nIt is understood, therefore, that City failed to properly maintain their records and any punishment forthcoming would be relating to an administrative error. WHAT WOULD THE PUNISHMENT BE IF FOUND GUILTY? \nThe FA operates on a \"three strikes and you're out\" basis regarding its anti-doping policies and it is believed this is where City have fallen foul. \nLeague One side Fleetwood were also hit with the same charge as City at the same time. As suggested by rules that are said to be broken, City wouldn't face a huge penalty if they are found guilty. Admin errors, basically https://t.co/Ice8EZKeYA — Sam Lee (@Sammy_Goal) January 11, 2017 \nCity have not commented on the charge but it is expected the club would receive a fine if found guilty, even though the alleged failure to maintain their records may have resulted in players missing a doping test. WHY HAVE CITY BEEN CHARGED AND NOT ANY PLAYERS? \nManchester United defender Rio Ferdinand was banned from playing for nine months and fined £50,000 in 2003 for missing a drugs test, with the FA acting on the basis that a missed test was as serious as a failed test. \nThe difference in this case, however, is that the FA adjudged Ferdinand to have missed the test despite being told he must provide a sample. \nChina’s message to Premier League 'hypocrites' \nRegarding City, it is understood any players who may have been absent when testers were at the training ground - as a result of any administration error - would not have been aware of their obligations. \nAs a result, it is the club that have been charged, rather than any individual players, and it is City's record keeping which is under the spotlight.
