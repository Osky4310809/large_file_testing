(Photo: Dan Powers, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — Adam Vinatieri booted his way into the Guinness World Records on Friday, connecting on 28 field goals in one minute. \nThe Indianapolis Colts kicker needed to kick 20 field goals to break the record. After he did so, Barclaycard presented a $15,000 check to the Pat Tillman Foundation, which goes to fund scholarships for military veterans and their spouses. \n“This is pretty great, isn’t it?” Vinatieri told USA TODAY Sports after setting the record. “Growing up, you would always hear about all these records, and people getting their name in there. But the most important thing is what we can do for the foundation. I have the utmost respect for who Pat was and what he stood for. Obviously he put his NFL career on hold to help defend our country. His family and friends starting the Tillman Foundation, it’s great working with them, to be able to help in a little, tiny way.” \nMORE COVERAGE Super Bowl LI coverage hub: Catch up on Patriots, Falcons stories \nTillman, the former Arizona Cardinals safety, left the team after the 2001 season to become an Army Ranger and was killed while serving in 2004. The foundation that carries on his legacy has given scholars like John Van Horn, who served active duty from 2002-08 as a flying crew chief in the Air Force, funding and community support to advance their careers. \n“The Tillman Foundation is an amazing organization,” Van Horn said. “I will say, it goes well beyond the actual schooling. Because I graduated in 2014, and I’m still getting benefits from them. They’re really supporting me with the business I started, Veteran Unmanned Solutions, offering personal drone services. It’s an extension of what I did in grad school, and now I’m using that to try to make an impact on society.” \nSeveral of the Tillman Foundation scholars were on hand to watch Vinatieri’s try at the record. Recently retired Colts punter Pat McAfee served as Vinatieri's holder one final time. \n“This has been overwhelming,” said Angela Durko, who earned her Ph.D. in tourism marketing at Texas A&M and currently teaches tourism classes to undergraduate students. She spent a year and a half in Iraq, working for the United Service Organizations. \n“Seeing the amount of people here has been amazing,\" she added. \"Everyone is happy and doing activities. This is the other side of the Super Bowl that you don’t get to see.” \nAn adjudicator from Guinness World Records in New York, Michael Empric, flew in to Houston and oversaw Vinatieri's performance. \nVinatieri’s father, Paul, was in the armed services, and his younger brother, Beau, is currently serving, with three tours overseas. \n“For what Pat did for our country, what he stood for and who he was as a man, and now what the foundation does, giving scholarships to military family members and stuff, it’s such an easy thing to get behind and support,” Vinatieri said. \n“It’s just an honor and a privilege to be a part of it right now.” \n*** \nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes \nPHOTOS: Super Bowl rings Posted!
