Welcome to The Morning Shift , your roundup of the auto news you crave, all in one place every weekday morning. Here are the important stories you need to know.\nAdvertisement \n\n1st Gear: Ghosn Gone, But Not Far \nPeople in the business often wonder how Carlos Ghosn—chairman and CEO of Nissan, chairman and CEO of Renault, leader of the Renault-Nissan Alliance and now chairman of Mitsubishi—has time to do everything. Can the modern man have it all? And by have it all, I mean three car companies?\nAdvertisement \n\nEvidently something had to give, because after 16 years Ghosn is stepping down as CEO of Nissan, the Japanese automaker his leadership more than likely saved from oblivion in the late 1990s and early 2000s. \nBut Ghosn isn’t settling into a quiet retired life of fishing, woodworking and turning his personal 350Z into a drift car. While he’s handing the Nissan CEO reins over to current co-CEO Hiroto Saikawa, Ghosn is keeping several other key roles, including CEO ones. Via Automotive News :\nGhosn, who joined Nissan in 1999 from France’s Renault SA and became Nissan’s CEO two years later, will retain his position as chairman of the Japan’s second-biggest automaker, the company said in a statement Thursday in Tokyo. Hiroto Saikawa, who currently serves as co-CEO and is a year older than the 62-year-old Ghosn, will become sole chief executive.\nThe changes are effective April 1.\nGhosn will also retain his roles as chairman and CEO of Renault and of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, spokesman Jonathan Adashek said.\n“There are still lots of things to be done inside the company (Renault) in order to make its growth sustainable and lasting and solid,” Ghosn told Reuters in an interview.\nAnd he will also stay on as chairman of Mitsubishi, a company brought into the Alliance last October through Nissan’s purchase of a controlling stake.\nSo he’s still chairman of Nissan, chairman and CEO of Renault and the group alliance, and chairman of Mitsubishi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:39:43.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
