International Women's Day \nTwo complain to TV regulator over Piers Morgan's rude interview style Wednesday 8 March 2017 10:26 GMT Click to follow \nA morning TV show is being criticised for giving a notoriously misogynistic MEP a platform on International Women’s Day . \nPiers Morgan interviewed Polish politician Janusz Korwin-Mikke on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. \nMr Korwin-Mikke is already facing disciplinary action after saying women should be paid less because they are “less intelligent” during a gender pay gap debate in the European Parliament. MEP says women are ‘smaller, weaker' and 'less intelligent’ \n“I only said that because they are shorter, they are weaker and less intelligent they are less aggressive, they earn less,” he told the TV show, while speaking from Warsaw. \n“By the way, a shorter man earns less than a tall man. The blonde earns more than a brunette. They are different, and it should not be equalised. \n“Of course they are less intelligent by several points on the IQ scale. There is no doubt on that.” \nEx-Daily Mirror editor Mr Morgan, whose own views on feminism have been critiqued in the past , responded by attacking the MEP over his three marriages and eight children by four women. Jim Jefferies slams Piers Morgan's defence of Donald Trump on live TV \nMr Morgan branded him a “horrendous sexist pig” and added: “How can you say that women are less intelligent than men when you yourself sound so unbelievably stupid.” \nSusanna Reid, perched next to Mr Morgan, said she felt like she “sat on the sidelines” during the interview. \nLondon Labour Party MEP Seb Dance, who last month held up a sign accusing Nigel Farage of lying , told The Independent : “It might make good TV to set up an interview so you can shout down the misogynist, but ultimately you’re giving him relevance when he should be dismissed out of hand. \n“Today of all days.” \nMr Dance had previously said Mr Korwin-Mikke’s comments in the European Parliament “crossed a line”. @londonnewsnow A non story reporting on the ramblings of a Polish MEP no one is interested in #Nonsense — Margot Parker MEP (@MargotLJParker) March 8, 2017 International Women's Day & GMB interview a Polish MEP who thinks women should earn less money because they're shorter & less intelligent.. — Jack Lebeau (@JackLebeau66) March 8, 2017 \nEast Midlands Ukip MEP Margot Parker said on Twitter: “Non story reporting on the ramblings of a Polish MEP no one is interested in #nonsense.” \nThe vast majority of comments surrounding the interview however are complimentary of Mr Morgan’s combative style.

I knew that during the written examination even if I got the same results with a male candidate, he would have been chosen. That¿ïs why I worked hard to pass the exam with a very good result ahead of the male candidates. In my opinion, gender inequality starts in our minds saying it¿ïs a male profession or it¿ïs a men job,\" said Cigdem.

In general, people think being a Shinto priest is a man's profession. If you're a woman, they think you're a shrine maiden, or a supplementary priestess. People don't know women Shinto priests exist, so they think we can't perform rituals. Once, after I finished performing jiichinsai (ground-breaking ceremony), I was asked, 'So, when is the priest coming?',\" Ichino said. \"When I first began working as a Shinto priest, because I was young and female, some people felt the blessing was different. They thought: 'I would have preferred your grandfather.' At first, I wore my grandfather's light green garment because I thought it's better to look like a man. But after a while I decided to be proud of the fact that I am a female priest and I began wearing a pink robe, like today. I thought I can be more confident if I stop thinking too much (about my gender).\" Reuters \nAn online petition meanwhile, signed by more than 54,000 people, is asking people to “kick out” Mr Korwin-Mikke. \nTwo people, as of 9.40am, had complained about the interview via TV regulator Ofcom.
