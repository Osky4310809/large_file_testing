Is in the midst of his Boy Meets World tour, Drake has had the opportunity to perform for his European fans not only the songs they know and love, but some unreleased material as well. He debuted a new song over the weekend in Amsterdam to accusations that he was ripping off XXXTENTACION's flow . Last night, he debuted yet another track at party in London. A video posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapipl) on Jan 31, 2017 at 9:07pm PST Drake shouts out the West End, which is probably why he chose to tease the song while in London. Will it appear on More Life ? He has hinted strongly that the project will be out before the end of February. He likely would not be performing these songs if he didn't plan on releasing the project soon.
