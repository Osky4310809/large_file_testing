By: FE Online | Bahraich | Updated: February 22, 2017 2:29 PM Just want to do ‘kaam ki baat’, he says. (ANI) \nThe debate on donkeys between Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and BJP doesn’t seem to be over. In response to a comment by his Gujarat counterpart Vijay Rupani, Akhilesh Yadav today said that he was not interested in knowing about donkeys of the state. Earlier Rupani had said that Uttar Pradesh chief minister, it seems, does not know about donkeys. “Gujarat CM is saying that I don’t know about donkeys of Gujarat. I didn’t want to talk about it further. But on Gujarat CM’s comment, I want to say openly, ‘I don’t want to know about donkeys of Gujarat. I just want to do ‘kaam ki baat”, he said at an election rally in Bahraich today. \nAkhilesh Yadav also targetted the BJP’-led Government at the Centre’s demonetisation step and said that the later had claimed that after the step, the menace of black money , corruption and and terrorism will stop, but where are the figures to show it. Reacting to Samajwadi Party recent alliance with the Congress , the chief minister also said that if friendship is done with a big heart ,it stays but if you befriend a miser bond is unlikely to last. Yesterday, the BJP leaders in Gujarat hit out at Akhilesh over his tussle for power with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and said that unlike him, donkeys are loyal and he should learn from them. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nOn Sunday, Akhilesh had targeted PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah and “appealed” to Bachchan not to “campaign for the donkeys of Gujarat”.

BJP leaders had also commented that Akhilesh does not know the difference between wild asses, which are found in Gujarat, and donkeys. \n(With inputs from PTI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:04:03.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
