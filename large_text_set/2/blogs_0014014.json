Anambra State indigene and father of five, 49-year-old Tochukwu Nwafor, has been nabbed by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for ingesting 73 wraps of cocaine weighing 1.699kg. \nAccording to the agency’s spokesperson, Mr. Mitchell Ofoyeju, the suspect was on his way to Dubai, when he was nabbed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja during a routine check on the passengers of an Ethiopian Airline flight. \nNDLEA commander at the airport, Mr. Hamisu Lawan, said that when the suspect was discovered to have ingested drugs, he was put on observation. \n“While under observation, he excreted 73 wraps of cocaine that weighed 1.699kgs” Hamisu stated. \nNwafor said he was offered N1.5m to smuggle the drugs to Dubai. \nAccording to his statement, he lives in Lagos with his wife and five children and got involved in the drug smuggling business because of economic hardship. \n“I thought it would be easy to go undetected,” Nwafor said. \nChairman of the NDLEA, Col. Muhammad Abdallah (retd.), called on members of the public to avoid falling into the trap of drug cartels who deceive them into thinking drug smuggling is very easy. \n“They offer them money to smuggle drugs but will not tell them they will be caught in the process. Unfortunately, most drug couriers only understand that they are being used when they have been caught,” he said. \nThe NDLEA said Nwafor would soon be charged to court. \nCopyright PUNCH.

SBBify \nLet’s see if he wouldn’t be on seat for the rest of the year. People Deceiving People. 9ja Eye \nDo not be deceived! with inept political crooks as Saraki, Atiku and many other PDP political devils running to APC, the party could be worst than Boko Haram terrorism. Now you can see APC does not represent the change she claims or the change Nigerian desired. As such and between two evils, PDP will be the lesser evil. Nigerians are not fools anymore to these politicians and GEJ/PDP will be re-elected. Hooded Ninja \nThe desired change is to throw Dumbo Jo and his dumb PDP out of Aso Rock: that’s the agenda of the glorious APC. And by God’s grace, it’s already a ‘mission accomplished’ shugaban muntari \nin your wicked and wild imagination. Kokori \nIn ur wildst deam Hundu Desmond Kungwa \nyou have the full knowledge of what these DEVILS defecting PDP to APC however we pray that they do not succeed.@9ja Eye Kalitaaruku \nI dont think Saraki deserves that name “crook” from my observation he is a very astute man Bobmanuel Dimabo \nDavid Mark is not hiding,he said when he comes back from his official trip he his going to meet the aggreived senators.this is diplomacy. SHOLA EUROPA \nDavid Mark may ran away from the Senate,but he can’t hide himself from the realities on ground nontheless. ST \nGo and study your English language before you comment here SHOLA EUROPA \nYou are not doing better either,try and work hard on your punctuation marks next time so as to give your comment more meaning. Hammed Famuyide n.y. \nThis is not the issue of a grammatical blunders my African brother, but the issues of doing the right thing for the progress of our mother land and that is where we should focus our attention right now. Americans do not need your grammatical perfection it is your brilliant ideas that matters, Stop fooling your self and be real,perfect your own language first and emncipate yourself from the english mental slavery .“BE AFRICAN”. . Hastel Idowu. \nAbbey, let the senators wait.Mark will appear if they have to sit on the budget,it is a very lucrative topic.Politics in Nigeria is very dirty. Alh Ameachi Rochas \nHe is only trying to save the seat of those senators that want to defect cos very soon those that have already defected,their seat would soon be declared vacant.. Hooded Ninja \n…Dumb post, characteristic of the jonathanians! stan Emelogu \nConsidering what is happening in the lower chamber by the time the Senate president returns he will not be reading the Saraki letter they would have changed their minds. That is why Saraki is crying for the letter to be read immediately. Last week he said there would be over 20 defecting senators. Earlier this week that number was called a solid 17 ( seventeen). Today it is eleven. David Mark should wait for the madness to pass before reading any letters otherwise that would be the only thing the senate would do this year. Just like toddlers in kindergarten the APC senators are crying to the headmaster, “please read my letter”, Can Saraki actually call himself a senator of the federal republic? Talk about impunity. unpeter2000 \nstan, if you want to talk about impunity, go tell your president about impunity in rivers state… tundemash \nNo need telling your blind man the market is over, when you stop hearing noises u will realise the beat has stopped ! kontryman \nabeg they are all the same. dem go eventually settle. PDP,PDM,APC..all corrupt looters. they are all fooling us to make us fight ourselves. after all they loot, drink beer ,smoke cigar and carry women together jman \nMaybe David Mark will run for the rest of his tenure hahahaha pdp is dead Alexander Dokubo \nIn 1999, 2003, 2007 & 2011, it was P D P….power to the people! Power to the people…P D P! Let’s see who will have it in 2015! tundemash \nYou can’t fool all the people all the time. Nice you listed the years of waste. Is your lot better off than you were in 1999 ? Alh Ameachi Rochas \nIs it only the FG that will construct roads,Health care and other basic amenities in your locality?what happen to the money allocated to your state governor and local government chairman..why not direct your grievances to them too.they are also part of the goverment.. Demi David \nYou meant ” Power Deserted the People ” for those years. chiboy \nDavid mark U̶̲̥̅̊ can only run run but ℓ̊Ƒ U̶̲̥̅̊ try to run pass terry G and Saraki u must run mad ctopher4xt \nFor how long will he absent himself. I think there should be another method to decamp. Imagine if a public servant does that, what do you think the government of the same would do? And this is a man that is paid in several millions yet absconding from duty post. But they are laying the precedence now not knowing that someone is observing them. Always be a good example to your followers. Never do government work as if its something you can do with anyhow mindset.. tundemash \nThey can only run, they can’t hide. PDP must go ! Hastel Idowu. \nThey MUST go or change for better. Sola \nCould it be that Mark has gone to Babalawo to make these senators change their minds? Lol Prince T \nThey shoukd let them go. Apc should let d senators be i dependent minded in their decisions. Suraki will go no matter wa. Afterall we heard dat one senator changed his mind. greatbiodun \nlet him keep hiding from his responsibility. He must have been persuading them Hastel Idowu. \nIf they are sitting on the budget he will be available. isabella ugo \nSaraki governed kwara state he never bettered the lives of the people. This people are shameless and selfish Hastel Idowu. \nAll PDP members are good if they maintain PDP membership.They become evil when leaving PDP, Amaechi and co are evil today because the left PDP. David Mark is a saint today but if he choose to leave PDP tomorrow then he becomes evil. \nFor me, none of our politicians of today is a saint.They are absolutely selfish and heartless. Hooded Ninja \nIsn’t your drunken jonathan worse? Johnl Obabueki \nthis is why we say punch is partisan. did punch not hear of an apc house of rep member decamping. he is Hon. David Ombugadu msugh \nMark cannot run away from the chambers for ever. Infact, even in his home state of Benue, the PDP is dead. Burial date, may 27th next year. Omo Olokoaroti \nHe may continue to abscond for the rest of his tenure as senate presido, but am sure the letter will definitely be read on the same floor before the expiration of his tenure. Simple logic! buying time to stop their actions, which has been uncovered. Baba Abbey \nSaraki and co should adopt the theory of necessity by read their notification letter to the press . Which means wherever Mark is on the earth it presume he has read and heard the notification of their letter. And that end the case . Man_Enough \nTHEY SHOULD MAKE COPIES OF THE LETTER AND SUBMIT TO EKWERENMADU. Dada Paulo \nSenator saraki,i want to tell u that u just full of ur self. Goni Perry \nSaraki has not been sent to prison for corruption, that is why he is threatening our democracy. change 2014-2015 \nWHAT HAS HE DONE, WHY SHOULD HE BE SENT TO PRISON JUST BECAUSE IS FIGHTING FOR HIS RIGHT IN THE HOUSE. Goni Perry \nEven Goje AnthonyIloegbunam \nThe stobbun Fly has been in history for always going down into the grave with the dead. So also was the case of Nebuchadnezza, he refuse all that was told him about touching God’s elect till he saw the writting on the wall. Will Olubukola and his cohorts say they dont know that they will not be properly welcomed into APC and no matter the way they go, Sen David Mark and Ik Ekwerenmadu has agreed on what to do andv nothing weill come out of it as matured men of the Red chambers. They dont just want to overheat the already heated Polity again by declaring the Seats of the Rebel Senators Vacant. This ploy is another way to say go back to ur party or else. AL Amin Usman \nEvery man has the right to decide his own destiny,so in the judgement there will be no partiality.David let the senators go. Alex Dennison \nPDP has made history, d only party to loose 5 govs in 1 day and they are still loosing members to an opposition party APC. It’s Game on, lets c how all d drama will unfold. shugaban muntari \nDefect and loose seats…. don’t let Lai to deceive you genuinely \nMy only question to these defecting law makers is ” what will become their fate if the court declares their seats vacant?” I thought these guys were law makers but they don’t seem to understand the law which is very clear. Biola Bello \n….and next time, he wont have time because he is in the toilet, or having a beer…..and having a nap.. and… $24840263 \nSenator David Mark is a VIRUS to our democracy. He is wasting his time and cannot stop the 11 senators from exercising their rights of association as enshrined in our constitution. last month, 37 lawmakers in the house of reps defected from the PDP to the APC. They presented their letter to the speaker and he promptly read it on the floor of the house. Why is David Mark acting differently? Or does David mark has his own brand of the constitution which is different from the one Hon. Tambuwal used to bless the defecting 37 members of the House? The supreme court has already interpreted that an elected public office holder can defect to a different political party and still retain his/her seat as in the case of Atiku Vs the state. Moreover, these defecting senators had gone to court on this issue last November and the court ruled that they can defect to another party and still retain their seats. So on what basis is David mark trying to stop them from defecting? David mark has literally killed the Nigerian senate and turned it into a deadwood and an outpost of the executive. The House of reps is alive under Tanbuwal while the senate is Dead under David mark. NOTHING GOOD WILL EVER COME OUT OF THE NIGERIAN SENATE UNTIL DAVID MARK IS REMOVED AS THE SENATE PRESIDENT,. dpfrank \nmy ibo people says dat one does nt leave a place of celebration,success and progress to a place of moaning. the trend is clear these senators has seen that the PDP has failed nigerians and APC is the way forward. the senate president cannot hide forever Peterson biafra \n9ija and APC must be prepare for this war they are causing . Titus Ojo \nAPC is a Ship on the journey for a mishap and total wreck; everyone doing business with Tinubu and Buhari will be sorry at the end. i am so sorry for our elderstatemen, who do not understand the basis of the present politics especially when Baba Iyabo has appeared on the scene along same coast with the self annointed leader of BokoAram. i am so sorry it is finish ,only a fool need an interpreter to know that by 2015 many of the politicians would only wake up to see themselves and their families in the graves they dug for the poor masses of our dear country. The fools says in his heart there is no God… Eturhobo Matthews \nMark please don’t bring shame to yourself the whole world is waiting for you,the whole world is waiting for the CHANGE. ALANI \nDavid Mark, please let these people commit theIr political suicide, The Nation is whatching and without prooning these poeple out PDP will remain unfocused. What should happen next is the relaunching and rebranding of the PDP for GEJ’s secound term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:34:36.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
