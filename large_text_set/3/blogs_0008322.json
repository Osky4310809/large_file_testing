According to research, some infections are transmitted through saliva or blood, and any family member with compromised immune systems is particularly vulnerable. \nSometime ago, there was a story about a house help that was infected with HIV but this was unknown to the family. According to the report, the children became very sick and after series of test, it was discovered that all the children were HIV positive too. After much investigation, it was discovered that the house help was positive and she confessed she was always using the children’s toothbrushes. \nAs homemakers, you must be careful especially when you share the bathroom with other family members or visitors. Some people don’t care sharing anybody’s toothbrush so it is your duty to keep your family toothbrushes safe. \nAside from the danger of sharing toothbrushes, a dirty toothbrush harbours germs that may be harmful. It is not clear whether bacterial growth on toothbrushes can lead to oral or bodily health problems, it makes sense to take precautions, especially when it comes to bacteria and viruses passing from one toothbrush to another. Germ problems have a lot to do with how and where we store our toothbrushes. It is not helpful that most toothbrushes sit next to the toilet. Always store your brush away from the toilet, and close the lid before flushing to avoid contamination from airborne germs. \nCare for your toothbrush \nRinse your toothbrush after brushing and stand it upright to air dry. Many bacteria can’t survive on dry bristles. \nAlways cover the lid after drying it to avoid insects especially cockroaches from crawling on it. \nDo not share brushes and avoid storing toothbrushes together. \nRinse your toothbrush thoroughly after every brush with hot water. For a more effective rinse, submerge your brush in hydrogen peroxide or alcohol-based mouthwash. \nWhen going on vacation, allow time for your toothbrush to dry before packing it, or buy a new one for your trip. \nBuy two toothbrushes at a time so you can swap out the old one when it’s time, without delay. \nNever put your toothbrush in a dishwasher or microwave. The damage that can result may make the toothbrush less effective at cleaning.
