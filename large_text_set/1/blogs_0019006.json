The attempt consequently had her digging herself further into a hole when she tweeted #RIPHalleBerry. \nConfused and shocked fans thought she was talking about the Academy Award-winning actress, prompting Cari to correct herself. RIP Halle the dog. \nFor the Outkast rapper, his third solo album is reportedly finished and it’s slated to feature Gucci Mane .
