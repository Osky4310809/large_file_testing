Your looks will fade, Cara. You can't cash in on your eyebrows forever.\n— BradTheLadLong (@BradTheLadLong) January 7, 2017\nDelevingne, being the classy individual she is, responded by giving Long a book suggestion.\n@BradTheLadLong Grow up and look at the bigger picture. Maybe try read a book or do something actually worthwhile pic.twitter.com/nlGySqQMcl\n— Cara Delevingne (@Caradelevingne) January 7, 2017\nLong, however, claimed the model was \"being rude\" and how he was only trying to help when he insulted her.\n@Caradelevingne Stop being rude, Cara. I am just giving you career advice to help you succeed. Maybe listen to it. Might get you somewhere\n— BradTheLadLong (@BradTheLadLong) January 7, 2017\nHe then seemed offended that Delevingne didn't know who he was. You know, because he's \"very famous.\"\n@Caradelevingne Do you not know who I am? I've had a very successful career I think I know what I'm talking about\n— BradTheLadLong (@BradTheLadLong) January 7, 2017\n@Caradelevingne Well I am very famous so maybe you should update yourself on celeb culture. Anyway, I tried to help. Whatever.\n— BradTheLadLong (@BradTheLadLong) January 7, 2017\nLong then ended the argument to avid helping Delevigne, who has over 7 million Twitter followers to his 11,000, get publicity.\n@Caradelevingne Honestly, I am not going to involve myself in an attempt for publicity. Try someone else.\n— BradTheLadLong (@BradTheLadLong) January 7, 2017\nThe next day, Delevingne revealed her secret project. She flew to Uganda to team up with Girls Up, a United Nations program that advocates for the health, safety and education of girls in developing countries.\nWe're in Uganda with @GirlUp Champion @Caradelevingne and UNHCR! Follow our trip all week at #WithRefugees to go inside refugee settlements. pic.twitter.com/9xE4gFjsne\n— Girl Up (@GirlUp) January 8, 2017\nIf you're wondering why Long has not responded to this new development it's because he's suffering from a case of foot-in-mouth syndrome.\nBONUS: The Suicide Squad on Their &quot;Scrappy&quot; Crew at CinemaCon", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Caradelevingne/status/817801194965827585", "https://twitter.com/Caradelevingne/status/817799116675612672", "https://twitter.com/BradTheLadLong", "https://twitter.com/GirlUp/status/818142619809251328", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/nSQjHdzL.jpg", "https://t.co/9xE4gFjsne", "https://twitter.com/BradTheLadLong/status/817806361606160384", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WithRefugees?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BradTheLadLong/status/817799302990925824", "https://twitter.com/BradTheLadLong/status/817804826314686465", "https://twitter.com/BradTheLadLong/status/817803655038533632", "https://t.co/nlGySqQMcl", "https://twitter.com/Caradelevingne", "https://twitter.com/BradTheLadLong/status/817801724903702528", "https://twitter.com/GirlUp", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/nSQjHdzL.m3u8"], "published": "2017-01-10T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:52:19.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
