Martin's ‘A Song of Ice and Fire’ novels. \nShowrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss last year announced a shortened run of episodes for the final two seasons after HBO had already confirmed season seven would return in summer, a departure from the usual April premieres. \nThe show has been teasing winter's arrival since its pilot episode, and with the season six finale entitled ‘The Winds of Winter,’ the camera crew has been forced to wait for colder weather. \nBenioff told fans at San Diego Comic-Con in July last year shooting would not finish until February and that \"there's no way to get the show out there until summer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:53:19.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
