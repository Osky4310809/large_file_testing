The addition of Eddie Lacy at running back is a major move – otherwise, they’re largely the same team we’ve seen for the past few years.

Their stacked roster under-performed last season, and unless they can shore up the holes left by the departure of studs like Calais Campbell and Tony Jefferson, the Cards are likely to continue their backslide. \nThat leaves the Rams and the San Francisco 49ers. The Niners won just two games last season and have the almost insurmountable task of overhauling their entire team, so Bleacher Report’s Brad Gagnon says that it’s the Rams who have made the more significant changes. \nVia BleacherReport.com : “The Los Angeles Rams didn’t necessarily make huge waves in free agency, and they didn’t sign as many outside free agents as the divisional-rival San Francisco 49ers. But a young L.A. team should be improving with time anyway, and the Rams at least gave some extra support to their young franchise quarterback, Jared Goff. Gagnon also believes that San Francisco’s ongoing failure to nab a franchise quarterback will continue to haunt them, while he sees serious potential for Jared Goff in his second season. Related: \nVia BleacherReport.com : “…the Rams provided Goff with an experienced new left tackle in Andrew Whitworth (pictured), who’s coming off back-to-back Pro Bowl seasons in Cincinnati. They also replaced top receiver Kenny Britt with the younger Robert Woods, who at least gives them more ceiling space at that position. While both the Niners and Rams improved their ailing rosters, the Rams have the benefit of a very solid defensive line, a young former first overall pick with the potential to develop further at QB and a revamped coaching staff that could be quite formidable in a division that’s clearly in flux.
