But when dressing for work, I’m definitely worried about looking professional more than anything else, and do my best to wear a collar on most days. Outside of the office, if you see me in a collar, I am probably working undercover.\nOver the summer, my \"home from work\" routine consisted of me immediately throwing on a pair of gym shorts and replacing my collar with an oversized tee. But now that the season has changed and we’re shifting toward six straight months of cooler weather, I’ve got a new addition to my after-work uniform: the All Day Every Day Pant from Public Rec.\nPublic Rec is a startup that specializes in technical leisure apparel for men; their focus is comfort first, with the belief that if you feel good, you’ll look good — not the other way around.\nFounder Zach Goldstein, an investment banker who formerly worked at JP Morgan and a private equity firm in Chicago, was frustrated with the quality of other lounge clothes on the market that he didn't feel comfortable wearing it outside the house. He quit his job in private equity with the goal of solving this problem.\nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015 based around the ADED Pant , Public Rec is now a full-fledged apparel brand ready to bring its product to a much wider audience.\nPublic Rec\nThe All Day Every Day Pant is best described as the comfort of sweatpants packaged in a look you can feel confident leaving your house in. And while they’re one of the most comfortable things I own, I think the real value in them is their look and cut. Because the pants are sized like jeans rather than sweats, your pair comes to you fitting like a glove (or, a good pair of pants), as opposed to a catch-all \"large.\"\nWhile I wouldn’t wear them out on a date or anything crazy, I’ve worn my ADED pants out to my favorite bar a few times with full confidence. They’re perfectly acceptable for running errands, stopping by a friends house, or picking up something from the store, and they’ve been great for biking on cool nights.\nAt $95, it’s clearly a high price point if you’re thinking \"this is just another pair of sweatpants.\" And if you’re looking for just another pair of sweatpants, there’s plenty of other, more affordable options out there . But the All Day Every Day Pant provides a ton of comfort with a look that won’t force you to keep changing after you’ve already decided to dress down after work.\nWhile I still wear my MeUndies lounge pants to bed , once I’m home from work, my first move is to put on my pants from Public Rec. If you’re looking for reliable comfort that you can wear every day while still being presentable to the outside world, these might be the pants for you.\nPublic Rec's All Day Every Day Pants are currently retailing for $95\nYou can buy your own pair here.\nThis article was originally published on 10/6/2016.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
