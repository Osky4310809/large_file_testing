CERN does not normally encourage visitors to hit its historic objects and these trained percussionists were fully briefed beforehand to avoid fragile components. \nBut honestly, I’d be more worried about summoning spirits from banging on all of those accelerator corpses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:46:34.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
