Rand Paul is absolutely right with his criticisms. \nThis smells like Obamacare lite. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-0'); }); \nHowever, Paul Ryan makes a good argument that this thing needs to be done in a layered three-phased way. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); }); \nThe problem is that’s not what the Republicans promised for years and years. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); }); \nThey promised full repeal. Full replace. \nYou can also understand why conservatives are skeptical of Paul Ryan. \nRegardless, some big news just broke. \nIt looks like the House Freedom Caucus may have sunk this bill. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nBut according to a new report in POLITICO , the House Freedom Caucus has 25 members who plan to vote against the bill. Because Republicans can only afford to lose 21 votes, if that number holds the bill is sunk. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nMore than 25 members of the House Freedom Caucus are opposed to the Republican Obamacare replacement, a spokeswoman for the group said Wednesday. With all Democrats expected to vote against the plan, it would take 22 Republican “no” votes to block it. The announcement came despite direct appeals from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and House Republican leaders. This story will be updated. \nHuge development. \nIt’s a POLITICO report so obviously we have to take it with a grain of salt but it looks legit. \nWhat would be great here is if everyone slowed down a little bit and went back to the drawing board. \nInvolve the conservatives. Sit Rand, Ryan, Trump, Jordan, Lee, Cruz, and all the major players down and iron this out. \nDemocrats are the ones who push through bad bills without thinking. \nLet’s not be like them… googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:22:45.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
