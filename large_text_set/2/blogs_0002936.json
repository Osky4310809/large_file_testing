This app can tell you if that olive oil, cheese, or clothing item was actually made in Italy. \nThe app, developed by the Reliability nonprofit organization, is designed to promote and protect true “Made in Italy” products. All you have to do is scan the barcode on an item—like a bottle of olive oil or some Parmesan cheese—that claims to be made in Italy, and the app will tell you if it’s true. The Reliability association verifies the products and production processes themselves, so you’ll know you’re getting quality Italian goods. The organization and app are still new, however, so not every product made in Italy is in their database. But that should grow over time. You can download the app on your smartphone in the iOS App Store or Google Play Store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:07:07.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
