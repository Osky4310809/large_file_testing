But in the biggest deal of his young presidency, the American Health Care Act, he came up short. But he's been plenty vocal about the need for a great negotiator-in-chief on Twitter before. Here are 13 Trump tweets that Trump probably wishes he could delete. \nRepublicans coming together \nApparently Trump was a bit too optimistic about the cooperation he was helping put together. \nA better negotiator \nTrump knows what kind of president we need. When it came to the health care bill, every time he tried to negotiate, things got worse. And it was never in line with his campaign promises. \nMaybe he forgot the leverage \nTrump tried to force Republicans to play ball with an ultimatum. Apparently he didn't have the kind of leverage he mentioned in his book. \nSometimes you have all the cards ... \nThis one is pretty delightful when applied to the current situation. Republicans have the presidency, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. Even with the deck stacked, he and Paul Ryan couldn't put the bill over. \nMaybe he needed more gold \nBusiness is one thing, but trying to get your party to back a bill nobody likes operates under a different set of rules. \n\"FAKE NEWS!\" \nTrump tried to spin the stories of failing negotiations with his usual disdain for the media. Hard to blame the \"fake news\" when Republicans aren't even willing to vote on the bill, though. \nThe goods \nThen again, he knows you need to deliver the goods. The American Health Care Act is not it. \nThe Great Negotiator \nTrump puts a lot of stock in his negotiation skills, but walking away with a big check in the loss column makes this a pretty rough self-own. \nThe only one who can do it \nTrump's constant assertion that nobody else could possibly make the deals necessary to repeal and replace Obamacare didn't turn out to be accurate. Turned out he wasn't the right person to make the deals, either. \nIt's your chance \nTrump insisted this was the chance for a better health care plan. Nobody bought it -- including Republicans. \nDon't be desperate \nWith advice like this in his book \"The Art of the Deal,\" it might have been a good idea for him to re-read his own material before trying to force the vote on the bill. \nBe flexible \nStories of the health care bill negotiations suggested Trump was anything but flexible. Reportedly, he gave Republicans an ultimatum to push the vote. It didn't quite work out. \nOr maybe it's all a ruse? \nThere are plenty of Trump supporters who think failing to \"repeal and replace\" is actually a long-term secret plan. Maybe he's playing the long game? \nBonus: Sean Spicer own \nSpicer has a few choice tweets from back during the Obama administration that he probably wouldn't want anyone to bring up again. Here's one.
