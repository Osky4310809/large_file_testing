The family writes that Peanut alerted her owner that she wanted to go outside Friday and took him to a field behind the house on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The owner found the little girl, brought her inside and called 911.\nThe Delta County Sheriff’s Office confirms the story and says the girl is OK.\nAuthorities say they found the parents nearby in a residence with “unsafe and unsanitary living conditions.”\nThe girl and another young girl were removed from the home. Prosecutors are reviewing the case.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:04:27.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
