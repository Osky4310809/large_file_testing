This is the largest amount the Republican Party has ever filed in a post-presidential election month. \nThe RNC now has $36.8 million in total cash on hand, $8.3 million in total disbursements, and zero debt. \n“I am encouraged by the historic support shown by Americans across this country as our Party unites under President Trump,” said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. “It is clear our message of bringing change to all people is resonating, and I am committed to harnessing this momentum as we continue to build on the successes we earned in 2016. The RNC has never been better equipped to champion the Republican agenda and use these resources to grow our majorities in 2018.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:42:26.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
