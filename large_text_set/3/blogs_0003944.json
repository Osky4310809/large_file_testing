Before Nougat, the Galaxy S7 received a minor update on March 17, starting with T-Mobile customers. The update was one of Android's monthly security patches, which should help keep your device secure. \nOn T-Mobile, the software version is now UVS2APB8, and Verizon is beginning to issue the same update, under version number VRS2APB4. These will likely change with the arrival of Nougat. \nDevices in various regions also saw a minor update on April 11 2016, bringing improvements to touch features on the screen (this is mostly aimed at the S7 Edge) and an additional settings in the camera settings menu that corrects for skewed images. The build number is XXU1APD1 and weighs 157 MB. \nA security patch and firmware update for European devices was spotted on a Dutch blog by GSMArena. The update brought the firmware version to XXS1BPJ1. \nTo check if your device is ready to download the patches, head to Settings > About device > Software update. \nSamsung Galaxy S7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:52:26.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
