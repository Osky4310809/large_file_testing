And I think that’s unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack \nSpicer’s boss also dismissed the article as “total fiction” in a tweet on Monday.\nThe failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me.
