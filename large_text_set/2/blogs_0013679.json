King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted an hour ago 2 \nLast night in Melbourne, Australia, Guns N' Roses had a bit of a Spinal Tap moment as their longtime guitar tech and announcer addressed the crowd as \"Sydney.\" \nThe band was quick to apologize via social networks, and the crowd didn't really mind that much as soon as the boys started rockin'. \nThe group tweeted: \"Melbourne! Accidentally after 30 years McBob made an error, we're truly sorry. Thank you for coming out tonight!\" \nSlash added: \"Melbourne, thank you for an awesome fucking evening! Apologies for the Spinal Tap intro! But, we had a great fucking time tonight! Cheers!\" \nAdditionally, Duff chimed in: \"Melbourne! WOW!! 70k strong 2nite. Don't b2 hard on McBob 4saying 'Sydney' in the intro... his wife and fam r fom here. Hell catch it plenty!\" \nYou can check out the announcement below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:41:31.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
