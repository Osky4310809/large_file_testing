Working under manager Aitor Karanka at Middlesbrough on a loan deal, he helped the team reach the finals of the promotion playoffs after scoring 17 goals in 40 games in the league. While Boro needed another year to actually make it to the Premier League, Bamford has spent the past 18 months at three top tier teams, struggling to find playing at each of Crystal Palace, Norwich City, and Burnley. Bamford’s recall was made official this weekend, which has prompted Karanka to reiterate his long-running theme of welcoming back young Bamfordinho should the opportunity arise. \"With Patrick it’s always the same, when he left the club I told him that the doors of our club will be open always for him. He made a great impact at the club. Everyone remembers what he did.\" -Aitor Karanka; Source: Northern Echo Although Bamford has not made a good impression in the Premier League just yet, moving to his former club, which is begging for offensive production would be a great fit for all involved.
