Add 3 tablespoons tahini to a measuring cup. On top of the tahini add broth or water until it reaches the 1 1/4 cup mark. Mix together. Combine wet and dry ingredients/ Add more water to your dough if it feels too stiff. Knead dough for a minute. Divide dough in half. Pull one-half into small balls and the other half into wing shapes. These will double in size so make them small. Cover with water or broth. Boil for an hour. Once cooked lay them on a paper towel-lined cookie sheet to cool. Make vegan eggs as directed. Make sure the egg batter is on the thinner side. Add more water if needed. In a bowl, mix 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Dip nuggets and wings into flour then vegan egg batter then back into flour mixture. Fry on high/medium-high until golden brown. Fry in small batches. Once cooked mix each piece with Buffalo sauce.
