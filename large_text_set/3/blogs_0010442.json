Stefan Savic He look quite fearsome, though (Photo: Johannes Simon) \nHe's a decent defender for Atletico Madrid these days, but 11 error-strewn appearances for Manchester City earned the Serbian a Premier League medal in 2012. Stuart Taylor Taylor points at the bench, where he usually sat (Photo: Getty) \nHas never been a first choice goalkeeper anywhere, but came off Arsenal’s bench for the last six minutes of the final match of the 2001/02 season against Everton to claim his 10th appearance and qualify for a medal. \nHe promptly conceded a goal to Steve Watson, too. Ronnie Wallwork Not a common sight \nIn his seven years at Manchester United, Wallwork only made 19 league appearances, but played enough times in 2000/01 season to earn a medal. \nThat’s far from the most interesting part of his life, though. \nDuring a loan spell at Royal Antwerp he was banned from football for life for attacking a Belgian referee, although the ban was later substantially reduced. \nA spell at Barnsley was cut short when he was stabbed in a nightclub and in December 2011 he was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of receiving stolen goods. Oleg Luzhny His face was always like this (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nThe permanently confused looking member of the Arsenal defence was supposed to be the long-term replacement for Tony Adams, Steve Bould and the like when he arrived at Arsenal in 1999. \nHe wasn't, but he did play enough to earn a medal in the 2001/02 season. Pascal Cygan Probably falling over (Photo: Getty) \n“He’s bald, he’s sh*t, he plays when no one’s fit,” was not a chant hollered by the Highbury faithful, but it sums up the dreadful defender’s form in 2003/04. \nHis displays underline just how good the rest of the Invincibles were. Luke Chadwick For every David Beckham there was a Luke Chadwick (Photo: Getty Images) \nThat so many Manchester United players feature in this list is testament to Alex Ferguson’s ability to polish terrible footballers. \nChadwick was another, in 2000/01, but he did enjoy an enduring career at MK Dons. Jérémie Alliadiere This was almost definitely in the League Cup \nAfter 12 years in football Alliadiere finally topped his personal best of five goals in a season, when he fired Lorient to eighth place in France’s Ligue One. \nBut in 2003/04 season he made enough appearances for Arsenal to qualify for a Premier League medal. \nHe did score four goals - but none of them in the league. \nSo... yeah, saying \"I won the league\" doesn't really mean much, Danny. poll loading Whose side are you on? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T13:59:24.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
