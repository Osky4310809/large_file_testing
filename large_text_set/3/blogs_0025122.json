But when Allison Kimmey's daughter asked this well-meaning question, this mom handled it like a champion.\nWhen the mother-daughter duo were at the pool, the little girl noticed her mom's stretch marks and was curious what they were from. Allison remained neutral and explained that she got them when she \"grew really fast\" as a kid and when her little one was \"growing in her tummy.\" When the child continued to inquisitively look at the lines on her mom's stomach, Allison realized that in this moment, she had the opportunity to teach her girl that it's OK to love your body and talk about it without shame.\n\"They are shiny and sparkly, aren't they pretty?\" she said to her daughter about the stretch marks. \"Yes, I like this one the best, it's so glittery. When can I get some?\" the child asked. Her mom sweetly responded that she might get her \"glitter stripes\" when she gets older, and her girl was left in awe of her mom's body.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fallisonkimmeybiz%2Fposts%2F1208730352578959%3A0&width=500"], "published": "2017-03-22T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:53:30.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
