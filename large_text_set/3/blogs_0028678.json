Let’s face it, this India v Australia series has been every middling cricketer’s unbridled fantasy. \nEvery second wicket brings a send-off, the opposition captain looks increasingly unhinged, there’s ridiculous flouting of the rules for minor gain; it’s all been very ‘grade cricket’. \nAnd so we now move to an appropriate decider in the most inappropriate location: Dharamsala, home to the Dalai Lama, with a ground that sits in the spiritual centre of Tibetan Buddhism. Has a setting of such tranquillity ever been so unsuitable to the tone of a sporting event? How are we meant to salivate at another of Matt Wade’s cutting jibes through the stump microphone with the spectre of the setting sun over the Himalayas thrown in our faces? \nLIVE stream the India v Australia Test Series LIVE on FOX SPORTS.

I’m asking quite seriously, because I do not have any idea what it will do, and neither do you. And you never have. Of course, that won’t stop us from making sweeping assertions about how it will play, sometimes 72 hours before play itself commences. There we’ll be on match day, grown adults, striding out to inspect the wicket on the morning of play, ready to examine the pitch like archaeologists on a historic dig. \nWe have a national fight-or-flight reflex to opposition wickets, and we flee at pace. Whether it’s club cricket or Test cricket, for Australians there’s only one conclusion to be drawn when away from home: it’s unfair. You don’t know the wicket, you’re not familiar with the wicket, it doesn’t suit you, so therefore it’s wrong. But at least you arrive to the conclusion scientifically. There is bound to be someone in your team who kneels down solemnly at the site of the monstrosity, pressing the tips of their unwashed, cigarette stained fingers into the wicket, milking the silence as the rest await his verdict. \n“It’s a sh*t tip”, he’ll declare as he rises to his feet, looking at no one in particular, before mumbling something about ‘top soil’ and ‘couch grass’ (pronounced coo-ch, of course) and striding off, irritated at another injustice he’ll have to endure. \nCASUALTY WARD: India fly in cover for injured Kohli Ranchi’s “sh*t tip*” saw 25 wickets fall across five days. Source: Supplied \nI sometimes marvel at how much Indians love the game of cricket. It’s a love that’s so passionate it verges on scary. If cricket was a woman, she’d definitely take out an AVO against India. Yes, Australians love cricket too, but despite forking out approximately $AUD1000 a season, one of the best feelings is when the game is over and I can go and drain the sorrow that accompanies an 18-ball duck. Unlike the Australian cricket team, I’ve never fielded for 210 overs across two-and-a-half days, but I’ve seen my fair share of opposition batsmen double-hundreds to know the relief one feels when the opposition captain nonchalantly waves his hand to signal the declaration. We traipse off the field with heads bowed, a public display of humility, even though we’re privately elated to get off the field and back to our iPhones to check our notifications. Fans out in droves for Kohli 0:42 \nSpeaking of captains, it’s true that some leaders transcend the very team that they represent; such is the power of their persona, their legend. The Egyptians didn’t fight the French, they were battling Napoleon. In 1943, the allies defeated Mussolini, not Italy. The Cleveland Cavaliers didn’t win the NBA championship: LeBron James beat Steph Curry. Now, I’m not saying that Virat Kohli is Napoleon Bonaparte, but if he loses to Steve Smith’s Australia, there is a good chance he’ll be exiled to a remote island in the Mediterranean. \nBut back to India as a social construct. People – particularly privately educated women in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s – talk longingly about the life-changing experiences they’ve had in India; how it gave them the opportunity to “find one’s self” and achieve a “spiritual awakening.” The book ‘Eat Pray Love’ really has a lot to answer for. My long-term girlfriend once tried to convince me to come on a three-month backpacking adventure through the subcontinent. She was determined to have a “meaningful travel experience;” to immerse ourselves in traditional meditation practices and discover our “inner zen.” Three weeks in, she had fallen in love with a free spirited, sexually fluid 64-year-old yoga instructor named Yogananda, and I’d hopped on a plane to Phuket, where I spent the next six months participating in illegal Muay Thai fights and drinking myself to oblivion. I managed to get a business class upgrade from Delhi to Phuket though, so it wasn’t all bad. Sharma forgets how to walk 0:56 \nWhat I’m saying here, is that for cricketers – and Australian men in general, with their inherent conservatism and deep-seated fear of change – a tour to India can be culturally, physically, and environmentally challenging. And that’s why Australia’s performance in this series has taken us all by surprise. Now, despite the Delhi belly, bizarre pitches, oppressive weather conditions and hostile parochial crowds, the Australian Test team somehow sits at the precipice of something historic. \nGood luck, lads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T05:22:51.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
