Yet even as we set goals, it’s important to be aware of any self-judging. Are the merciless standards of perfectionism just waiting to clamp down? Or can we combine commitment to practice with kindness toward ourselves?” — Sharon Salzberg, author of “Real Happiness: The Power of Meditation”\nBegin the day by taking a few minutes to just breathe, before checking emails, social media and news.\nSet aside short periods , between five and 15 minutes each day , where your intention is simply to be more mindful.\nPay attention to the present moment in a gentle, accepting way. It can be while you are walking, sitting or lying down.\nHave fun with your mindfulness practice. Pick one quick activity you do each day — drinking a cup of tea, washing a few dishes, brushing your teeth.\nAs you do each activity, pay close attention to the sensations in your body. Instead of simply going through the motions, n otice what thoughts and emotions come up. And if your mind wanders, just note that and return to the present moment.\nSee if you can make the activity a mindfulness exercise for a week. Feel what’s happening in your body and simply enjoy the activity.\nHow to Meditate Meditation is a simple practice available to all, which can reduce stress, increase calmness and clarity and promote happiness. Learning how to meditate is straightforward, and the benefits can come quickly.", "external_links": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/03/well/mind/well_MFRL_newyears/well_MFRL_newyears-superJumbo-v2.gif", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/07/health/well_meditation_guide_promo/well_meditation_guide_promo-master495.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-04T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:49:36.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
