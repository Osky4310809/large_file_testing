Daniel Schisel says the boy apparently got the hooded sweatshirt he was wearing caught on a hanger attached to a wall. Emergency responders took the boy to a hospital, where he was declared dead.\nSchisel tells the Minneapolis Star Tribune family members, who live in nearby St. James, were in the store at the time. He calls the death “a tragic accident” and says no charges are being pursued.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T00:51:34.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
