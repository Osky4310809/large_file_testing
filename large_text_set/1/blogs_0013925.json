They’ll sell. It may well go to the end of the window but West Ham will wash their hands of a playmaker cloaked in genius but tinged by trouble. \nIt says much for Dimitri Payet that he has gone on strike to force a move not to Real Madrid or Barcelona. Not even to PSG, Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea or Liverpool - but to Marseille. The side not even close to being the best team in the French League. \nThe side with big ambitions but currently sixth, 14 points behind leaders Nice. \nHe wants, again, to be a big fish in a small point. And, of course, to be weighed in with a pay packet bigger than the record £125,000-a-week deal he is on with the Hammers. Payet in action this term (Photo: Ian Walton) Slaven Bilic during his press conference (Photo: West Ham United via Getty) Read More \nLet’s not kid ourselves, he is a wonderful player who has given the Premier League some scintillating moments. \nBut he is not bigger than West Ham. No chance. \nHe is not bigger than a club for whom less gifted players have given far more over a longer period of time. Payet in action for Marseille The French side are currently sixth in Ligue 1 (Photo: AFP) \nA point of order here. In general terms there is no sentiment in football. When clubs want to get rid of a player they waste no time in doing so, in some cases quite ruthlessly. \nAll the same, Payet's conduct is breathtaking. He isn't even prepared to wait until the summer. He wants to go now. He isn't interested in playing, training or the club's results. He simply wants out now. No trial separation, no counselling - divorce. \nBilic has defended him in press conferences. Played down the interviews in which Payet touted himself for a move to Marseille, Man United or practically anywhere that would have him. \nFinally this week the Hammers boss showed he'd had enough. He outed him. Quite right too. The club had begged Payet to stay during showdown talks on Tuesday. Pleaded with him to give them just six more months.
