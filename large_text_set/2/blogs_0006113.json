JOE’S SHOCK APPROACH COULD FIX YIPS \nRoughead, who missed the entire 2016 season as he recovered from cancer treatment, was officially unveiled as the Hawks’ skipper in January, taking over the reins from three-time premiership captain Luke Hodge. \nHeppell, who also missed all of last year but due to a doping ban, was only announced as the Bombers’ 2017 captain on Wednesday , with the 24-year-old hoping to inspire an Essendon catapult up the ladder. media_camera Jarryd Roughead was announced as Hawthorn’s new captain. Picture: Michael Klein \nIt’s a long way from Roughead Street. But come Round 1, the two ‘Gatha boys will be deciding which team kicks which way in the first term ahead of arguably the most highly-anticipated game of the season. \nAnd Heppell can’t wait for it. \n“I had a bit of a yak with Rough the other day,” Heppell said on Wednesday, \n“Two AFL captains from Leongatha, just a small country town — it’s pretty enormous. It’ll be a great moment for the two of us. \n“We can’t wait for that occasion. It’s going to be a massive game for both clubs.” \nJust after Heppell was announced the Bombers’ skipper, the Parrots took to Facebook to voice how proud they were of both Leongatha juniors. \n“To have two young men raised in rural Leongatha town captaining their AFL clubs is not only a credit to themselves, but also to their families, friends, schools, sporting clubs and previous coaches — emphasising LFNC and the local basketball associations — and the community as a whole,” the Parrots statement read. \nHeppell and Roughead’s laid-back, easygoing nature — an attitude synonymous with country folk, especially footballers — have been well documented. \nIt’s not an attitude necessarily synonymous with AFL captains, but Heppell believes it’s an approach that can work for him. \n“The way I go about my leadership and my footy is probably not so much slamming blokes,” Heppell said. media_camera Dyson Heppell was all smiles after being named the new captain of Essendon. Picture: Wayne Ludbey \n“Happy to give it if need be, but … I’m quite understanding in regards to picking up players and giving feedback. Also making sure I follow up with real care — and I do really care for my teammates. \n“That is my sort of authenticity in my leadership.” \nHeppell said he wanted to be a captain that pushed standards and lived by Essendon’s values. \n“I really want to empower everyone in this playing group to be leaders themselves, because I’m going to need the support of every single player in this playing group,” Heppell said. \n“I feel I’ve made some real developments in my game over this pre-season. It’s probably been the strongest one I’ve had.” \nDon’t miss your Footy team’s youngsters on show! FOX FOOTY will show every game 2017 JLT Community Series live.
