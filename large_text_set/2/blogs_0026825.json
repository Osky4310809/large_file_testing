Buttermilk & Bourbon is the latest restaurant from chef Jason Santos, also of Abby Lane and Back Bay Harryâ€™s, and it draws inspiration from New Orleans . Buttermilk & Bourbon takes over the space formerly occupied by BarLola, and Santos told Boston Magazine he thought that the 160 Commonwealth Ave. spot called for Southern cuisine. The menu features just that: In addition to a raw bar with oysters and peel and eat shrimp, there are honey-glazed biscuits, buttermilk fried chicken, crawfish and crab soup, and a whole host of other New Orleans-inspired dishes like steamed mussels, fried pickles, short rib croquettes, and barbecue shrimp. The bar at Buttermilk & Bourbon is open from 4 p.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday, with the kitchen open from 5 to 10 p.m., and the Friday and Saturday hours will extend one hour, with the bar open until 1 a.m. and the kitchen until 11 p.m. Fried chicken Courtesy of Maria DeNapoli Boiled peanut hummus Courtesy of Maria DeNapoli", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:52:55.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
