Children under 12 are free. \nYou can buy tickets for both weekends here . \nThe market will return to its regular free entry for all on May 6. \nVendors can still apply to sell at this year's market, but there are already a number of vendors signed up, selling goodies such as Romanian chimney cakes, Burmese palatas and Middle Eastern stews. \nNew cuisines represented this year include Indonesian, Nigerian, Puerto Rican, Ecuadorian and Macedonian. \n“Just as much as New York City is a global financial center, it is also a city of small businesses and immigrants,\" John Wang, the market's founder, said in a statement last week. \n\"The neighborhoods and the cultural landscape here are inextricably shaped and driven by small enterprises and the unparalleled diversity,\" Wang said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:04:49.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
