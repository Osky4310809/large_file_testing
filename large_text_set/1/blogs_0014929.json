With equal parts admiration and exhaustion, chef Julia Sullivan surveys the scene unfolding at the intimate preview of Henrietta Red , her restaurant and oyster bar debuting in February just down the road in Nashville's trendy Germantown neighborhood. Under strands of twinkling lights, friends and family are piling their plates with raw and roasted oysters before settling in at long communal tables—all on full display for neighbors out for an evening stroll. Robby Klein   \"An event like this is a great representation of what I want Henrietta Red to feel like: communal, convivial, a place where people can come in and relax,\" Sullivan says of the Low Country supper, which tonight is being staged in the front yard of the 12th Table, a local event company. More than two years in the making, her Southern space will fill an oyster-shaped void in Nashville's exploding culinary scene. It will also serve as the Nashville native's first solo restaurant, the payoff of eight years of intense training and working in New York City. After stints at Per Se, Blue Hill at Stone Barns, and Haven's Kitchen—where she met her new venture's co-owner and general manager, Allie Poindexter—Sullivan returned to the Music City in 2013 and reconnected with a grade-school friend, Max Goldberg of restaurant group Strategic Hospitality. At the time, Nashville was in its \"It City\" infancy, with such in- demand spots as Husk and the Catbird Seat having opened relatively recently. Goldberg tapped Sullivan for the opening team of his sprawling foodie playground Pinewood Social; 10 months later, she left to focus on fundraising for Henrietta Red—a process that led her right back to Goldberg & Co. Most Popular Robby Klein \"We approached [Strategic Hospitality] and said, 'Could you give us some advice and introduce us to some people?'\" Sullivan says. \"They came back and said, 'Let's see if there's a way we can make this work [together].'\" With Strategic on board as a partner, Sullivan moved ahead. She'd developed the concept of Henrietta Red while in New York, but her vision evolved upon resettling in Nashville, she says. \"It became more refined. A little more personal, feminine, and special.\" The coastal-chic space seats about 100, plus 20 on the patio. Come spring, Sullivan hopes it will be a go-to spot for baseball fans—First Tennessee Park, home of the Nashville Sounds triple-A baseball team and often more social scene than sports venue, sits two blocks away. In addition to the oyster bar, Sullivan notes the menu's focus on seasonal, locally sourced proteins and vegetables (e.g., chicken liver and wood-roasted sweet potatoes) whenever possible.   Robby Klein \"We're really pushing the oyster bar aspect, but we hope people are pleasantly surprised by how good the rest of the food is,\" she says. Named after the chef's late paternal grandparents, Henrietta and Edgar \"Red\" Sullivan, the restaurant is also influenced by the romance of New Orleans, which Sullivan absorbed while studying finance at Tulane University. The space isn't fussy, she emphasizes, \"but so much of the restaurant design in Nashville is concrete floors and exposed ceilings. We wanted it to feel softer.\" That translates to a color scheme with blues and greens complemented by luxe marble. When it opens, Henrietta Red will anchor one of the tastiest blocks in the city, with James Beard–winning chefs on both sides: Tandy Wilson's City House and Donald Link's Cochon Butcher. \"Not every night at the restaurant will be [like this],\" Sullivan says as she looks over at her guests, \"but this is the kind of stuff we'd love to be able to do in the future. It happened very organically, in the best way possible.\" Robby Klein OYSTERS 101 Chef April Bloomfield, owner of the John Dory Oyster Bar in New York, and Charlene Santiago, the shellfish hot spot's executive chef, share their tips. Reporting by Kelsey Murdoch. Start Fresh Only buy oysters with uncracked, closed shells and a \"fresh, ocean smell,\" Santiago says. \"If it's open, this is an indication that it's old or dead. You can try tapping the oyster to see if it closes up, in which case it's fine.\" Gear Up \"You need to get yourself a good oyster knife,\" Bloomfield says. \"I prefer one with a short blade and an upward-curled tip; this gives you leverage when opening up the oyster.\" Shuck It Using a kitchen towel to protect your hand from any slips, hold the oyster level on a table with the rounded side down. Work the tip of your knife into the nook near the hinge, then twist to pop open.
