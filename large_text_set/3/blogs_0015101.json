Now, Spike wants to reopen that wound by airing a documentary about Heath Ledger . It will be part of Spike’s I Am documentary series that has covered the deceased icons Bruce Lee, Chris Farley, and John F. Kennedy Jr. before. And just like those previous documentaries, I Am Heath Ledger will be a must-watch for fans of the late actor.\nAlthough it feels like just yesterday, Ledger died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Beyond his tragic death at the age of 28, this documentary will follow the Australian actor’s life up until then.\nThat means that I Am Heath Ledger should show his early acting roles, his breakout in 10 Things I Hate About You , his performance in the critically-acclaimed Brokeback Mountain , and his Oscar-winning turn as the Joker in The Dark Knight . The Ledger documentary will also go into his personal life. Beyond his struggle with addiction, his romantic relationships with famous actresses will undoubtedly be covered.\nFans should expect Ledger’s relationship with Michelle Williams — and their daughter Matilda — to be a heartbreaking main topic.

But considering what a success Ledger was at such a young age, there are sure to be people in Hollywood who want to speak about their co-star and friend.\nFILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images If you need a moment to emotionally prepare upon hearing the news of this Heath Ledger documentary , we’re sorry to report that you won’t have much time. That’s because I Am Heath Ledger is scheduled to premiere on Spike in May 2017.
