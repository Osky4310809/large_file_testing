By Anonymous Published: February 20, 2017 Comments Print Email PHOTO: STOCK IMAGE \nThe Indus Academy, a private school in Karachi , has recently been subjected to a controversial scandal that left many appalled in its wake. This past Wednesday, some students filled a bottle with urine and threw it next to a teacher which resulted in some of the contents splashing onto the said teacher. Before we delve further, it is important to note that these students had been left unattended for several classes. \nThe next morning, as the students were lining up for assembly, the principal entered and scolded them for taking too long to line up before she went on to discuss the said incident. Once she said whatever she needed to regarding the incident, she left the assembly area along with the vice principal, to discuss the matter further in their office. She left one of the teachers in charge to monitor the students. \nThe teacher left in charge soon began yelling at the students before picking out individual students at random and asking them if they were the ones responsible for the act. Furthermore, her way of ‘questioning’ was astonishing as she eventually resorted to dragging the children by their collars and poking them. Apart from her physical behaviour, the language she was using was extremely distressing as well. \n“I was leaning against the wall when she said ‘ tumharay baap ki shadi hai kya?’ (Is it your father’s wedding ?)”, said Ali*, one of the students. \n“She said ‘I don’t like your face’”, said Ahmed*. \n“‘Should I say that you did it?’ She threatened. ‘Do you want me to?’” stated another student. \nThe entire senior section was made to stand outside in the sun from 7:40am to 10:45am. During this time, the students were not allowed to eat anything or drink water. Eventually, students of grades nine, 10 and 11 were sent back to their classes while students of grades seven and eight were held back. \nSeveral students from the said grades, aged 12 – 15, were then taken by the principal, vice principal and teacher to the bathroom where the principal forced soap into their mouths while the rest of the students stood under the blaring sun. \nThis incident was brought to light on Facebook , and many parents and students were left completely horrified. While many students voiced their opinions online, the teachers involved also took to social media to comment on the situation.

Instead of acknowledging the situation, these teachers resorted to cyber bullying .

However, the principal, vice principal, and teacher involved could have avoided this entire issue if they had simply checked their security camera footage instead of punishing an entire section for the misdemeanour of a few students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:02:06.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
