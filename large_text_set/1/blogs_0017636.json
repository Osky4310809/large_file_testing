Atlassian and Trello are among the most popular software companies pushing for better project management, so it only makes sense for them to team up; and this is exactly what’s happening.\nAtlassian has reached an agreement to acquire Trello for $425 million, of which $360 million dollars are paid in cash. The rest will be reimbursed in shares.\nWith the deal closing by the end of March, users are obviously wondering what will be happening with Trello. Atlassian plans to keep the Trello services and brand operating independently. The only difference is Atlassian will be handing more resources and support to the Trello team in order to “accelerate development efforts”.\nThis means it’s business as usual with Trello. Your teams can continue to use Trello to stay organized and keep projects running smoothly (at least until further notice).\n\nThose who haven’t used Trello yet should check it out. I have experience with it and can tell you it makes work much fluid and organized. Not to mention the fact that it is super simple and intuitive. You can just drag projects around to keep track of a job’s progression. Once finished, drop it on the “done” section and you are ready to take on the next task.\nHow many of you have used Trello before? How about Atlassian’s services? Some of these include Hipchat, JIRA Service Desk, JIRA Core and Confluence.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T06:01:19.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
