He’s even said he plans to stick around D.C. and keep an eye on soon-to-be-President Trump, speaking out if he feels it necessary to protect his administration’s “progress.” \n“This really is a matter of — ‘narcissism’ is probably overstating it — but he says his own reputation is at stake,” Krauthammer said, comparing Obama’s exit to George W. Bush’s. “I don’t think W. cared as much. I think he thought history will decide how he did, and he didn’t have to meddle in that.” \n“As a matter of sort of decency, you let your successor operate — see how he does — and don’t heckle him from the sidelines. I’m not sure Obama plays on the same playbook.” \nNot the same playbook at all. Bush, like his father before him, had class. Eisenhower had it, and to spare. \nIf Obama an ounce of it, he’d know how to say goodbye. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
