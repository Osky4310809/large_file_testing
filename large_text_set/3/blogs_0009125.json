File photo \n  Stricter border and immigration policies adopted by US President Donald Trump could cut remittance flows to the Philippines, according to investment banking giant Credit Suisse. \nIn a report titled “Asia: US Immigration – Tighter border, lower remittances,” Credit Suisse said the Philippines would experience the second biggest reduction in remittance flows next to Vietnam as the new US administration takes steps to tighten border and immigration policies. \nAs a result, the investment bank said the tighter border controls in the US could cut remittance flows to the Philippines equivalent to 0.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next to Vietnam’s 0.4 percent of GDP but higher than India’s 0.1 percent of GDP. \nThe main economic impact of tighter border controls in the US on Asia would likely come from weaker remittance inflows due a decline in the number of Asian workers in the US. \n“The remittance shocks could also prove permanent, resulting in slower remittance growth in the future. Other Asian economies are much less exposed due to their low share of remittance in GDP,” Credit Suisse said. \nIt warned the shock could add to existing downside risks to current account positions in these economies, exposing them to shocks that generate capital outflows.   \n“We see this risk particularly pronounced in the Philippines and Vietnam – the former could see its current account surplus disappear. In addition, while the overall impact on the economy may be manageable, segments such as private consumption and property are likely to be affected by the decline in remittance more than others,” it added. \nThe Philippines and Vietnam would see current account balances swing from surplus to deficits. \n“Shocks to remittance could therefore leave these currencies more exposed to capital flow fluctuations,” Credit Suisse said. \nThe investment bank sees the country’s current account surplus declining further to $2.7 billion this year from $4 billion last year after hitting $7.7 billion in 2015. \nFurthermore, the decline in incomes remitted to family members back home could result in weaker consumption and property purchases thus weakening the GDP growth. \nThe investment bank said weaker remittances pose material risk to GDP growth as money sent home from the US to the Philippines account for three percent of GDP. \nHowever, Credit Suisse is confident the Philippines would remain resilient despite the shock as a result of the tighter border and immigration policies in the US just like what happened during the recent oil price downturn that affected several countries in the Middle East. \n“One caveat is that we have not taken into account a potential shift in Filipino overseas workers from the US to other countries in our analysis. We note the Philippines’ remittances have been historically very resilient to negative shocks,” the investment bank said. \nLatest data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed cash remittances went up five percent to a record high of $26.9 billion last year from $25.61 billion in 2015 due to the steady demand for skilled Filipino workers abroad. \nCash remittances from about 12 million overseas Filipinos account for about 10 percent of the country’s GDP.
