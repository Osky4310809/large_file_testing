Both Donald Trump and John Lewis have taken heat over their comments, with members of their own respective parties criticizing the two men. \nIn relation to this whole event, Nobel Prize winning economist and liberal commentator Paul Krugman used his New York Times column space to not only defend Lewis, but to also make the case that Lewis questioning Trump’s legitimacy was patriotic. \nBut let’s not talk about Mr. Trump’s ravings. Instead, let’s ask whether Mr. Lewis was right to say what he said. Is it O.K., morally and politically, to declare the man about to move into the White House illegitimate? \nYes, it is. In fact, it’s an act of patriotism. \nKrugman went on highlighting the FBI Director James Comey’s release of a letter just before the election indicating there were new developments in the Hillary Clinton email investigation along with questions surrounding Russia’s influence on the election. Asking why we should’t question Trump’s legitimacy due to these issues, Krugman also explained that by doing so, it may “also help limit” the power Trump’s gained with the office. \nRegarding accusations of being unpatriotic by questioning Trump legitimacy, the NYT columnist stated that “patriotism means standing up for your country’s values.” \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T17:37:30.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
