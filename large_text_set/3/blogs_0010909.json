GETTY Mr Davis also promised the Government would give Parliament a vote on the final deal \nThe Commons defeated that change by 335 votes to 287, Government majority 48, with two Tory rebels joining Labour and other parties, after Brexit Secretary David Davis pledged to seek to resolve the issue as soon as possible in formal talks. \nBut the UK should not offer the guarantee until the around one million Britons on the Continent got similar protection and the EU had refused to consider the matter until Mrs May invoked Article 50, he said. \nMPs then voted down, by 331 votes to 286, Government majority 45 – with no Tory MPs voting against the Government - the Lords amendment to put into law both Mrs May's promise to give Parliament a vote on her final EU deal - and a guarantee of a vote for Parliament if she does not strike a deal and plans to take Britain out without one. \nMrs May has said that no deal is better than a bad deal. GETTY Mr Davis pledged to seek to resolve the issue as soon as possible in formal talks LIVE images from the House of Commons Mon, March 13, 2017 MPs tonight voted to scrap both House of Lords' amendments to the Article 50 Bill. ALSO The House of Lords has voted down an attempt to reinsert the amendment on EU nationals by 274 votes to 135. PA 1 of 18 The result of a vote on the Brexit Bill in the House of Lords, London, after MPs overturned House of Lords amendments to a Bill authorising Theresa May to commence Brexit negotiations \nOpening a two-hour Commons debate, Mr Davis said he was \"disappointed\" the Lords had amended a simple Bill with changes that were unnecessary and would damage Britain's negotiating position. \nMost voters, regardless of how they voted in last June's referendum, now wanted Mrs May to \"get on with the job in hand and to do so with no strings attached\", Mr Davis told the House. \nMr Davis also promised the Government would give Parliament a vote on the final deal. \nBut demanding one if she failed to get a deal could stop her taking Britain out of the EU without a deal if she deemed that the best option. \nMr Davis also said the amendment would encourage European negotiators to offer bad terms in hopes Parliament would overturn last June's Brexit vote. NC Sir Keir accused Mrs May of being “obsessed” with getting the Bill through unchanged \nAlthough its backers said it was just a call for a \"meaningful vote, the reality is that there are some who would seek to use this to overturn the result of the referendum. \n\"Any prospect that we might actually decide to remain in the EU would only serve to encourage those on the other side to give us the worst possible deal in the hope we will do exactly that.\" \nUrging MPs to reject the Lords' proposals, he told the Commons: \"These amendments will undermine the Government's position in the negotiations to get the best possible deal for Britain and that can't be in the national interest.\" \nFor Labour - as leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed a rally outside Parliament called by hard left allies Momentum in defence of EU citizens - Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused Mrs May of being “obsessed” with getting the Bill through unchanged and of using migrants as a \" bargaining chip\". \nLib Dem former leader Nick Clegg said his Dutch mother had lived here for over 50 years, and his wife Miriam is Spanish. Both women had raised families, worked and paid taxes in Britain. Who voted for Brexit? UK regions which voted leave revealed Mon, February 27, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain. Getty Images 1 of 8 GREAT YARMOUTH: The town of Great Yarmouth on the East Coast of England voted by 72% to leave the European Union. \n\"It beggars belief that people like that have had a question mark raised over their status, their peace of mind, their wellbeing here because of the shameful inaction of this government,\" said Mr Clegg. \nPro-Remain Tory former minister Anna Soubry insisted she was not trying to stop Brexit but Parliament must have a vote on all the options if Mrs May came back without a deal and proposed plunging Britain into the \"worst possible outcome\" of \"falling off the cliff edge\" into World Trade Organisation rules. \nTory former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the Government was \"deranged\" to propose denying MPs a vote if no Brexit deal was reached. \nEarlier, as the Commons debate began, activist Gina Miller whose court case forced the Government to introduce the Article 50 Bill, complained to the BBC \"that a number of MPs seem to think that their role is to be a rubber stamp ... they haven't asked enough questions, they haven't pushed for these amendments\". \nShe confirmed she was ready to return to court if Parliament was not guaranteed a meaningful vote. \nEarlier Downing Street said Mrs May had made clear in talks with her Maltese counterpart Joseph Muscat \"that a strong EU is in all our interests. She said we are committed to a smooth and orderly exit and to maintaining close ties with our European partners in the years ahead\".
