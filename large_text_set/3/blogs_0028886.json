Jared Polis.\nHutton called the vandalism “unacceptable,” and he urged anyone with information on the crime to come forward. Polis said “it’s time for us to stand in unity. These acts must end.”\nUnacceptable! I urge anyone who has information about this incident to come forward and help us solve this crime. @FCPolice @FCCrimeStopper \n— John Hutto (@FCPSChief) March 26, 2017 \n\nThe vandalism that occurred at the Islamic Center in Ft. Collins is unacceptable. It’s time for us to stand in unity. These acts must end.\n— Rep. Jared Polis (@RepJaredPolis) March 26, 2017 \n\nThe center said on Facebook that the vandal, a young man, broke the building’s back door at about 4 a.m. and inflicted “quite a bit of damage.” No injuries were reported.\n“I think the perpetrator is a young man, probably in his late 20s or early 30s, very strong,” said Tawfik Aboellail, president of the center. “He tried to break in using a screwdriver, kicking at the door. Finally he broke two back doors with five-pound rocks.”\nAboellail said, “Thank God no one was here.”\n“The Bible being thrown into the prayer hall is a message in itself,” Aboellail said. “We are peaceful people. We love our Christian and Jewish brothers. We don’t have any problems with anyone.”\nPresident of the Islamic Center of Fort Collins Tawfik AboEllail on the extent of the damage.

It could happen to anybody.”\nA Fort Collins police representative did not return a message seeking comment Sunday. A rally, organized by Fort Collins religious leaders, was scheduled for 5 p.m. Sunday to show support for the center.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T01:15:22.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
