They showed times where she grabbed from Reuters, World Net Daily, the New York Times , Commentary (something she also did in the late 90s in a column for the Wall Street Journal ) and the Associated Press, among other outlets. \nOut of the 50 columns CNN reviewed, seven showed plagiarism. In a couple of instances, she copied her older work for the columns. The Washington Times editor-in-chief told KFILE they were looking over her columns. \nEarlier today, it was reported that the publisher of her book had “taken down” the book while it investigated the plagiarism claims. So far, the Trump transition team has stuck by Crowley, calling the accusations politically motivated. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:31:22.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
