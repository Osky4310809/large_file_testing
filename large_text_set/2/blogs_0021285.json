It doesn't matter if a child came from your womb or if you found that person at age two, 10 or 20. If the love is real, the caring is pure and it comes from a good space, it works.\" \nWinfrey says being a mentor for 172 students at the girls-only boarding school Johannesburg was the equivalent of having her own children.
