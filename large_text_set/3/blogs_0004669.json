The Swede had his success in the clinch and matched Vannata's stand-up prowess with counters of his own. The UFC posted some of the damage Teymur was able to afflict in the clinch: #UFC209 @ufc 3/5/2017, 4:54:47 AM This was supposed to be a chance for Vannata to show his promise as the next big thing in the lightweight division. Instead, Teymur proved he's been sold short as a promising prospect in his own right. The 27-year-old now moves to a perfect 3-0 in the Octagon and could be in line for a ranked opponent next time out. This fight certainly wasn't Nurmagomedov-Ferguson, but it was a fun fight that fans wouldn't mind seeing again down the road when both of these guys are likely bigger names. Rashad Evans vs. Daniel Kelly Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images What was set up to be the glorious debut of Rashad Evans at middleweight turned out to be the finest moment of Daniel Kelly's career. The former Olympic judoka brought the pressure to the former UFC champion. The bout was close, but it was almost always fought in close quarters, where Kelly turned the fight into a bit of an ugly slugfest. The UFC captured the typical exchange in the bout: #UFC209 @ufc .@SugaRashadEvans lands the nice body kick, but @DanKellyJudo gets in the clinch, then lands the right hook! #UFC209 https://t.co/jSS1DeYE0o 3/5/2017, 4:17:23 AM There were moments where Evans appeared to be a new man at his new weight class, but they were few and far between. Kelly's suffocating pressure gave Evans few opportunities, and Suga's boxing appeared to be a shadow of itself. While this win will launch Kelly into new heights, it casts doubt on where Evans will go from here. At 37 years old, the former champion is getting long in the tooth and just didn't generate the kind of performance one would expect from a man who had another run in him. This could be the end of the road for someone who was once one of the best fighters in the sport. Cynthia Calvillo vs. Amanda Cooper Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Chances are you had never heard of Cynthia Calvillo before her UFC debut on Saturday. After all, until the day before the event, she was scheduled to make her first appearance for the promotion on the Fight Pass Prelims. Instead, she was given the opportunity to fight Amanda Cooper on the main card of a pay-per-view event and responded with a first-round submission victory. Calvillo showcased some serious moves, including a slick transition from an anaconda choke to back control. Josh Gross gave the newcomer props for the impressive performance: Josh Gross @yay_yee Cynthia Calvillo with all sorts of grappling fun against Amanda Cooper. Finishes in R1 with an RNC. That anaconda-to-back move was sweet. 3/5/2017, 3:52:38 AM The 29-year-old debuted as a professional just seven months ago. Now she has a win on a UFC pay-per-view card on her record. Taking a fight on short notice and then having it promoted to the main card is about as fortunate as it gets in this sport, but credit has to go to Calvillo for maximizing the opportunity. It wouldn't be surprising to see her fast-tracked for a promotional push and much bigger things on the horizon for the Team Alpha Male product. Mark Hunt vs. Alistair Overeem Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images In terms of fights with the most impact on their division, the heavyweight scrap between Alistair Overeem and Mark Hunt was only second to the title fight between Thompson and Woodley. Overeem looked like a man who will be fighting for the title again sooner rather than later. He lost his last fight against Stipe Miocic for the title, but showed that he's still one of the best fighters in the division with an outstanding performance against Hunt. The Reem showcased his newfound technical, methodical approach to the striking game throughout the fight. In the first round, he went to work picking apart the shorter Hunt from the outside with leg kicks, but he became more aggressive as the fight went on, taking the battle to the cage. From there, Overeem was able to land a vicious elbow-knee combination that dropped Hunt like a big-game trophy.
