Virat Kohli during a press conference. PTI \n\"No, it has changed for sure. I thought that was the case but it has changed for sure. As I said in the heat of the battle, you want to be competitive but yeah I have been proven wrong. The thing I said before the first Test, I have certainly been proven wrong and you won't hear me say that ever again,\" Kohli had said . \nHowever, the young captain, in a series of tweets, clarified that his comment was not meant for the entire Australian team. \n\"My answer at the post match conference has been blown way out of proportion.

Cricket Australia also jumped into the controversy when its CEO James Sutherland said Kohli perhaps does not know how to spell the word sorry. \nThe fireworks continued till the final Test, in which Ravindra Jadeja and Matthew Wade were involved in a verbal duel and Smith was heard using a cuss word against Murali Vijay for claiming a catch that was deemed not clean. \n 49  49 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T08:31:56.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
