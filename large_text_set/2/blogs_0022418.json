UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 0 \nAn interesting rundown has surfaced via Loudwire, presenting 10 most intimidating dudes in the world of rock and metal music. \nYou can check out the list below, watch the video for the whole thing. Top 10 Most Intimidating Rock & Metal Musicians According to Loudwire \n10. Orion (Behemoth) 2. Greg Puciato (The Dillinger Escape Plan) 1. Phil Anselmo 17 hours ago in Music news , 25 comments 4 17 hours ago in New releases , 22 comments 13 What about Peter Steele? Even though he's no longer with us. 31 He was the first person I thought of when I saw this poll. 2 In what universe is Tom Araya more intimidating than Kerry King?! 15 True. Except for being the frontman of Slayer, Araya seems like one of the nicest, most likeable guys in the world 7 This guy is a mountain! I wouldn't mess with him! 2 A rather short one too 1 Isn't that the same video where he got his ass ko'd with one punch? 2 Loads of videos of him fighting and not exactly 'winning' though, so he's slightly less threatening through that. Still would have punched you for looking at him wrong in a concert crowd, that's intimidating enough. 6 'Intimidating' in that people are scared to be near him in case they get flung with shit or punched. 2 Nick Cave. While he's no Hulk he's a scary motherfucker 10 How about mick Thomson from slipknot? The guy is a man tank! 20 this. also, not for his size but Sid Wilson's movements and shit are pretty terrifying 1 I was expecting him and zakk wylde for size alone....but craziness def plays into this list. 0 Clearly they havn't seen any of Varg's vlogs :> 11 Peres.T.Peanut 210 · 10 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply It's kinda funny to see Greg Puciato ranked n.2 on this list. I met the guy in person and he's one of the most polite people I've ever met! But the guy's a monster on stage, gotta give him that, hahaha! 5 I'm the only musician that makes myself intimidated, not because I'm scary, but because the sounds my guitar makes when I play. 4 Surprised Mustain isn't on the list 4 Uncle Devy when he was in Strapping Young Lad, that skullet was pretty intimidating 3 How's Lemmy not in this list? by the meaning of intimidating he kicks each and everyone of these asses, and that's without even picking up the bass 3 Cause ghosts are spooky, not intimidating. 20 Eifler121 160 · 7 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply How is Tom Araya on this list? I love Slayer but what's intimidating about him?!? He's basically a laid-back hippie who's always smiling in every interview EVER. I guess when he's on stage? But it's obviously just part of the show because of how different he is off stage. 2 Abacus11 360 · 5 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Axl should be on the list. He's not that impressive physically but I wouldn't stay around when he's pissed off and he seems to be a tough son of a bitch when it comes to a fight. Otherwise he's a very gentle and nice dude, friendly and even a bit shy. But he can easily go out of control. Not knowing how to handle him is an intimidating thing. Like a bomb ready to explode. 1 I agree. I feel like he's that unpredictable lightning quick guy that possesses way more strength than his body would suggest. 0 As far as black metal frontmen go I would consider Mortuus way more intimidating than Gaahl 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:52:10.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
