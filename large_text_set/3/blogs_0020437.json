She joins chief meteorologist Dave Fraser, Greg Dutra, Matt Makens and Chris Tomer on the Pinpoint Weather team. \nTribune Broadcasting, which owns Denver’s local Fox and CW affiliates, is also touting Lebel following news that Fraser and the Pinpoint Weather team were certified as “Colorado’s most accurate forecast by Weatherate, Inc.,” according to the station . \nHowever, Lebel was so new to the job that she hadn’t even gotten her station-approved headshots taken when she talked to The Denver Post.
