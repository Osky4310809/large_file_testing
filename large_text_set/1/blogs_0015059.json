Like many other brands, Samsung has started listing the stock apps for its smartphones on the Play Store. This way, Galaxy devices owners can keep their stock apps updated easily through the Play Store. \nThe Samsung Email app has all the features that you would expect from an email client, including POP3, IMAP, and ActiveSync support. It supports push notifications, combined inboxes, and threaded messages too. The app can now be updated without a need for a full firmware or operating system upgrade. \nAs you would already know, the app is compatible only with Galaxy devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T09:16:19.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
