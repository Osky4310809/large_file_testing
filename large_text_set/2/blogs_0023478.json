Apple’s pick for “Invaluable Utilities”. ***Every time you move a content from one app to the other, compare data side by side or multitask in any other way, you need all the windows arranged accordingly. Magnet makes this process clean and simple.In one drag to the edge, you size a window into half of your screen. And by dragging windows to the corners, you snap them into quarters. Slide them to the bottom edge of your display to create thirds. Taking advantage of such arrangements eliminates app switching and greatly enhances workspace efficiency.Magnet supports keyboard shortcuts as well, for every command it has to offer. There is that little icon sitting in the Menu Bar where you can find a predefined set or create yours.Features:・Left/Right/Top/Bottom Halves of the screen supported・Left/Center/Right Thirds of the screen supported・Left Two Thirds & Right Two Thirds of the screen supported・Fullscreen & all four Quarters of the screen supported・Activated by dragging (optional)・Activated by keyboard shortcuts (customizable)・Operated via Menu Bar icon ・Runs both on Retina and regular displays・Up to six external displays supported・Built to run on all macOS versions since 10.9 Mavericks・macOS 10.12 Sierra optimized CrowdCafé Web Site Magnet Support   2.1.0 \n・Left/Center/Right Thirds of the screen are now supported – Drag a window to the bottom edge of your screen to create third.

Screenshots The best at what it does by The Charlie Brown There are a lot of software apps out there that do the exact same thing, but you will encounter the occasional bug. Or maybe window-resizing used to be snappy and is no longer. I feel that this app does what it says it does, does it well, and is consistently bug-free.- Resizing windows is always snappy (so far)- The developers seem to be updating the app quite often, so I’m not worried about the app becoming unusable after a few software updates Ok but Moom is better by ungeziefer Seems to work fine with a few small idiosyncrasies…One example: as far as I can tell there is no way to stack 2 windows on top of one another by dragging, you have to use the menu bar options or keyboard shortcuts. Dragging a window to the top maximizes it, and dragging it to the bottom puts it in the middle 3rd (or left 2/3 or right 2/3, depending on where your cursor is…). Kind of odd and inconsistent...“Moom” (move + zoom) does the same thing as this app, but is slightly more intuitive and customizable. Recommend trying Moom instead. More useful then I thought by PhoneItIn Been using Mac since the original Mac 128 days. Over that time I’ve have occassionally used a window arrangement tool, but it would usually be for a short phase, as there would either be a system conflict, too unweildy to use, or worked out to be not any faster then resizing a window or two manually.Magnet hits the sweet spot of easy and fast to use, and is quickly becoming a normal process within my workflow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:14:24.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
