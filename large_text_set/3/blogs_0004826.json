Floyd Mayweather: The fight can happen if McGregor really wants it to “This guy says that I’m a [expletive], I’m scared, I’m a chicken. I said well, all 49 said the same thing, and all the results was the same. ... If Conor McGregor really wanted to fight, we could make it happen. But the thing is this, is he blowing smoke up everybody’s [expletive]? We need to know, is he blowing smoke?” Richard Mackson Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports Floyd Mayweather: McGregor would make a lot of money by losing to me Shannon: If Conor fights in UFC and loses, a Mayweather superfight loses its luster “Conor has looked so good in his last two fights. He’s been phenomenal. Now, some of that shine — a lot of that shine, almost 90 percent of that shine — if he were to fight again and lose, a lot of that shine would be gone. The people won’t be clamoring for this fight like they are now. So go ahead and let’s have a five million pay-per-view buy, let Floyd go ahead and make his $400 million, Conor you get your $125. But see the difference between Floyd and Conor: Floyd is his own business man. He doesn’t have to negotiate with a company to fight. The UFC basically, and I don’t want to take this the wrong way, but they basically own Conor McGregor . Anything as far as [fighting goes], he has to get clearance from them.” Adam Hunger Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: Dana White is the key to this fight happening “This is not Muhammad Ali vs. ... Skip, you remember when Muhammad Ali and Gorilla Monsoon fought in the exhibition? But this, you have two apex fighters in their respective sports, they’re gonna fight for real. Now, glove size, all that can be negotiated. But for Conor, he has to get this from Dana White. Dana says, 'Look, Conor, we made you somebody. We put you out there and put money in your pockets when you were no one. So we need to get a piece of this.’ Floyd’s going to want it on Showtime pay-per-view. I’m sure UFC’s going to want it on their pay-per-view station. So how do we get there? And Conor can’t do anything. Conor can do all this yapping all he wants to, but all he’s doing right now is bumping his gums, because unless Dana White gives him his blessing this fight is not going to happen . And if Dana White can’t line his pocket with at least $25, 50 million dollars, it’s not going to happen.” Joe Camporeale Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports Skip: Floyd Mayweather is not the main draw in this fight “I think all the yapping, all the bumping of gums is being done by one Floyd May-or-may-not-weather Jr. What’s highly amusing to me right now is that Floyd is so self-absorbed, so egomaniacal because he is so wealthy — more power to him — that he has convinced himself that he is the draw here when he is no longer the draw here . I’m going to remind Floyd if he’s watching, Floyd Mayweather Jr. is starting to look more and more to me like Floyd Sr., because he has turned 40 years of age. And I hate to bring this up, but his last real fight was Marcos Maidana, and that was September of 2014. Two-and-a-half years ago. I’m talking about a real fight, because Pacquiao tore his rotator cuff three weeks before that fight, or Floyd would have been in big trouble in that fight …. Then he comes back and he fights Berto, and it was just an embarrassment to the sport of boxing. It was kind of a death knell for the sport of boxing.” Greg M. Cooper Greg M. Cooper-USA TODAY Sports Skip: Floyd is lucky Conor is even considering this fight “ Floyd is bordering on becoming a has-been and a once-was . And he’s talking like he’s the big draw when, globally, the far bigger draw is Conor McGregor — the baddest man on the planet. Floyd is lucky that Conor would even consider fighting him. And Floyd is a smart enough businessman, very shrewd operator as a businessman, that he knows that there’s going to be an issue with Conor breaking away from UFC through Dana as you just brought up. And remember, UFC’s still pretty young, so it started up … it sort of gave Conor the stage on which to become the baddest man on the planet. He doesn’t have much bargaining power, nobody does in UFC at this point.” Shannon: “Here’s the thing though, Skip. Yeah, the UFC gave him that platform, but there’s a lot of guys they’ve given platforms — but they couldn’t fight, and they just get washed away. Conor McGregor, yeah he got the platform, but what did he do? He rose up. You opened the door for him, but he walked in . You didn’t carry him in.” Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Skip: You can't run and hide from opponents in MMA “To your point about ‘He better fight Floyd before he loses in UFC,’ what I love about UFC from the start — the best have to fight the best. You can’t fight tomato cans. You can’t run from this opponent or that opponent, or wait until they’re too old to really stand up against you in the ring. So it’s just head-to-head, head-to-head, head-to-head, at your best, at your best, at your best. And people are going to lose, because it’s hard! Obviously in MMA and UFC fighting, you can’t run and hide. You’re going to get rocked if you don’t stand and fight. If you’re not the superior fighter, you can’t just run from it.” Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Shannon: There's too much money to be made for this fight to not happen “And Conor knows that, and Conor says, ‘Why am I going to potentially lose for $3 million when I could lose and make $100 million? ’ If it makes dollars, it makes sense. So Conor’s saying, ‘Hold on, we can do … if Pacquiao-Mayweather did 4.4 million buys, we can do at least 5 million buys. At 100 bucks a buy that’s 500 million, plus the live gate, plus the sponsorship.’ Skip, you’re potentially looking at a $600 million fight. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument, Floyd Mayweather takes $350. Conor gets another $100 to 150. Let the UFC have $100 million.\" Skip: “OK, answer me this. Is $350 more million dollars worth 49-1 to Floyd Mayweather? Losing to some MMA fighter? Is it worth it?” Mark J. Rebilas Mark J.
