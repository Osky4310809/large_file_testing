Which is why rabbit/great dane owner Meylin Hadad freaked out when she saw her bunny escape from her hutch into the backyard. \nHadad and her daughter raced to catch the rabbit before the Missy the great dane could, but before they could get to her the dog had already chased the escapee down. \nLuckily Missy is a giant (as in massive) ball of love. \n“I’m like, OK, that’s it,” Hadad said. “But when I got there, nothing had happened. She had grabbed the rabbit, but she was just holding her on the ground with her mouth. Her teeth weren’t even touching her. And when I picked up the rabbit, she started licking her. After that, I’m like, OK— this dog will never hurt anything.” 2 \nHadad wasn’t always lucky enough to be the owner of the adorable Missy. She used to be the dog of one of Hadad’s friends, but when she grew to be too large they didn’t want her anymore. “They got Missy when she was a newborn,” Hadad explains. “They weren’t too familiar with the breed. They didn’t realize how big she was getting, so at 6 months, they didn’t have the space for her, and they didn’t want to take care of her.” 3 \nMissy instantly became part of Hadad’s (already large) family. The Florida native has a small animal sanctuary including dogs, cats, horses, goats, chickens, birds…and a porcupine. Hadad says that Missy treats each and every rescue-mate as one of her own children (yes, even the one with spikes). \n“She just immediately wants to play with everybody,” Hadad says. “Any new animal that I’ve brought in, she wants to nurture and take on the mommy role.” 4 \nThen, Gordo came along. The little piglet was found running down a Miami sidewalk, so of course Hadad added him to the roster. \nApparently the obsession began the moment Gordo met Missy. 5 \n“That pig went directly to the dog,” Hadad says. “Obviously the first time they met, I held Missy on a rope, just being cautious. But nope — they’ve been playing ever since. Gordo hops on top of her. It’s adorable.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:51:48.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
