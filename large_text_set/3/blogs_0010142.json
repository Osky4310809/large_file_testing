This Black color OnePlus 3T is a limited edition device sold under the branding of ‘OnePlus 3T colette edition.’\nOnePlus has partnered with the French concept store ‘colette’ to create this limited edition variant of the OnePlus 3T. To celebrate the fashion boutique’s 20th anniversary, OnePlus has produced only 250 of these specially engraved units of the exclusive all-back OnePlus 3T which feature the famous ‘colette’ logo on the back. Apart from that, the device is identical to the standard OnePlus 3T model.\n\nAs limited edition devices go, the OnePlus 3T colette edition is available exclusively at colette’s store in Paris. Sales of the device begin on 21st March at 11am from the physical shop, and since only 250 of these exist, the phone is expected to be sold out very quickly. OnePlus also says that this is the one and only chance to acquire this limited-edition device.\nThe OnePlus 3T (128GB) collette edition will cost €479 (~$510), and early birds will also receive a pair of OnePlus Bullets free with the device.\nIf you really like your phone to be black in color, have the expendable cash, live in Paris, and want colette’s branding on your phone as a symbol of status, then the OnePlus 3T colette edition is worth considering. For the rest of us in the world, the regular OnePlus 3T should suffice.\nSource: OnePlus Forums ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T18:50:49.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
