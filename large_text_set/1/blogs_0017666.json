St. Louis police seek help in solving murder of 'good, hardworking student' From staff reports ( … ) \nToni Stevenson in an image provided by the group Young Voices with Action Inc. \nST. LOUIS • Police asked Friday for the public's help in solving the murder of a 15-year-old girl as she returned home from a high-school basketball game Tuesday. \n\"We know people in the community know something,\" Capt. Mary Warnecke said Friday at police headquarters. \"We are pleading with them to come forward. We don't want more loss of life or retaliation.\" \nWarnecke said the victim, Toni Stevenson, \"was a good, hard-working student who was well-liked\" and has not been linked to any trouble. But Warneke said investigators were confident that she was the target of the two killers. \nToni was shot about 7 p.m. outside her home in the 6000 block of Thekla Avenue, in the city's Walnut Park neighborhood. Police said she had just driven herself home when two men armed with semi-automatic rifles ran up, opened fire and fled. \nToni was a sophomore at Northwest Academy of Law, a magnet school in the former Northwest High School, where she was on the basketball, volleyball and soccer teams. She lived with her brother, 28. She had a learner's permit; a solo driver must be 16 to get a license. \nWarneke, commander of the investigative division, said police were reviewing video from a camera on the residence on Thekla. \nAnyone with information is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 866-371-8477.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:41:30.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
