WINFREY: A h bbiitttt! CLINTON: Everyone stop speaking, please. You're upsetting the ancient owls who bear the souls of our foremothers. And also you're giving me a headache. GIF WINFREY: I'm just calling to report in on Pudzer. CLINTON: Explain this mission to me again. YATES: Oprah had Pudzer's ex-wife on her show years ago. The government asked for the footage, which only Oprah had. She obliged. CLINTON: I love it. Sounds very simple. No strings. No trace. WINFREY: EXAAAACTLY! I'm just an American citizen doing my duty. Never mind that I could literally bring about the downfall of every person in Washington if I wanted. CLINTON: Amazing that the entire time your television show was running you were slowly building a cache of information on enemies of the United States. WINFREY: It's a hobby. CLINTON: So you were saying hobby? WINFREY: Now I garden, though. I'm out of the political game. Oprah pauses. Another sly smile escapes the shadow of Yates' hat.
