When August fourth shall fall on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be held and considered the holiday.” \nThe only thing surprising about the bill is that its sponsor—state Rep. Sonya Harper, a Democrat from Chicago—didn’t mandate Sunday church services be moved to make room for the “illustrious” Obama’s birthday. \nThe bill, which was later rejected by everyone in the Illinois House of Representatives with even a shred of common sense (a little more than half), would have cost taxpayers an estimated $20 million. \nHowever, one good thing did come from the foolish attempt: Conservatives across the country had a good laugh at the former president’s expense. \nReplying to a story about the proposed holiday in the Washington Examiner, one reader wrote on Twitter, “It’s a little early for April Fool’s Day, no?” @dcexaminer @KatMcKinley It’s a little early for April Fool’s Day, no? \nAnother person wrote, “Wow, this is NOT from The Onion.
