But President Trump will probably fill the rest of his first 24 hours in office beginning to demolish his predecessor's legacy, which he has promised to reverse almost completely once he is sworn in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. \nTrump has already signaled that Day One of his presidency will be activistic in its agenda and energetic in its execution. The president-elect has cut short the time he will spend watching the customary parade and pared down the number of inaugural balls he will attend with his wife, Melania, who will then be first lady. \nHis transition team says that while Trump is happy to observe many of the historic traditions surrounding presidential inaugurations, he also wants a rapid start on his promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" \n\"Traditionally, there's a lot of celebratory action on Day One,\" Sean Spicer, incoming White House press secretary, told the Washington Examiner . \"I think there's going to be plenty of that.\" \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts   news desk and delivered to your inbox.

Each is intended to create new obstacles for Trump either to overcome or resign himself to as his presidency begins. Many of Obama's eleventh-hour maneuvers, such as increasing sanctions against Russia and designating large swaths of western land as federal parks, could tempt Trump into dedicating part of his first day to rolling back what was put in place only after he won his election campaign. \n\"Most of the literature on presidential transitions asserts that the real effective political power of the outgoing administration declines the closer you get to Inauguration Day and therefore the more necessary it is for the outgoing administration to consult with the incoming administration and try to arrive at a shared policy,\" said David Clinton, an expert in presidential transitions at Baylor University. \n\" President Obama seems to be leaning on the side of less in the way of consultation and more on the side of insisting that the power and the responsibility and the right to make decisions all continues to reside with him right up until the last minutes,\" Clinton added.
