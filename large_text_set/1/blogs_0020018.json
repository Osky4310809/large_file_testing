Has he ever really felt that he’s worthy enough to be cared about? \n“What is his struggle and what is his angst and what does he feel? Has anybody done anything except bark at him about what he should be versus understanding who it is that he is? \n“Those simple human engagements create a dynamic where you either earn respect or you don’t. \n“I can honestly say from a distance if Nick Kyrgios doesn’t respect you, it’s because you haven’t earned it or it’s because he doesn’t respect himself.” \nAgassi, tennis’s original rebel without a cause, said the timing wasn’t right for him to coach Kyrgios. \nBut the eight-time Grand Slam winner suggested his own life mentor, strength and conditioning guru Gil Reyes, may be willing to lend a sympathetic ear to Kyrgios.

Life can strip us, it can humble us and it’s only at those points that we search for something deeper, of more value. \n“When you’re in that place, of course I think a person like Gil can be an incredible asset. Gil set the platform for me to hear (my coach) Brad Gilbert. \n“I don’t know if I would have responded to Brad if I didn’t go through a period of time of believing that life can be and should be different.” Nick Kyrgios.
