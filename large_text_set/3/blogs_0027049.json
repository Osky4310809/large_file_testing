She allegedly told churchgoers that she had been kidnapped and gang-raped in the woods behind the church.\nTalbott told investigators that she was raped by two black men in ski masks while a third pinned her down. She claimed that the suspects had kidnapped near her car in an apartment parking lot, news station KXII reported .\nPolice found her car with a door open and her phone, keys and shoes scattered on the ground.\nTalbott was brought to a nearby hospital for examination, where physicians were unable to corroborate her claims that she had been sexually assaulted, according to police.\nThe 18-year-old admitted to police on Tuesday that the allegations were false.\n“It’s unfortunate a person can falsely report such a major incident in our community that wastes the time of law enforcement and needlessly puts some people in fear,” Denison Police Chief Jay Burch said in a statement .\nIt is unclear what prompted Talbott to report the hoax.\n“Breana Harmon Talbott’s hoax was also insulting to our community and especially offensive to the African-American community due to her description of the so-called suspects in her hoax. The anger and hurts caused from such a hoax are difficult and so unnecessary” Burch said.\n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T03:41:34.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
