Credit Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters SEOUL, South Korea — There was no hesitation, no ambiguity. On Friday, all eight judges on South Korea’s Constitutional Court voted to remove Park Geun-hye from the presidency. The historic vote sent shivers down the spines of many South Koreans. Three months ago, the National Assembly impeached Ms. Park on charges of corruption , breach of trust and dereliction of duty. Ms. Park has denied the charges, but the justices disagreed, saying she abused her authority. Ms. Park is now an ordinary citizen. Without presidential immunity, she will most likely face criminal charges. It is a rapid fall from grace for a woman who became the first female president of South Korea, and now the first president to be stripped legally of her position. And she should be. Ms. Park has indeed been corrupt and incompetent, letting her friend Choi Soon-sil use the government to extort $69 million from businesses for personal gains, but she also did so much more than that. She ran this country aground in pursuit of her conservative agenda and actively undermined South Korea’s hard-won democracy and international standing. One more year in power, and the damage she inflicted would have been irreversible. Continue reading the main story Ms. Park’s ascent to power was ominous. Just days before the 2012 presidential election that she won, claims surfaced that the National Intelligence Service, South Korea’s main spy agency, was trying to influence the outcome. People working for the opposition party found an intelligence agent holed up in a studio apartment in Seoul, from where she had been spreading conservative propaganda on the internet. Law enforcement officers covered up the crime, and Ms. Park coasted to victory. Only later was it revealed that the National Intelligence Service had sent out more than 1.2 million tweets to support her and her Saenuri Party. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Once in power, Ms. Park mounted fierce attacks on the labor movement, long a thorn in the conservatives’ side. In October 2013, the government began an effort to deregister the left-wing Korean Teachers and Educational Workers’ Union. Two months later, the police ransacked the offices of the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions under the pretext of finding railway union leaders who had been protesting privatization. The Justice Ministry eventually succeeded in sending a leader of the union, Han Sang-gyun , to prison for staging what it called an illegal antigovernment demonstration. In April 2014, the nation witnessed the Sewol ferry sinking , which claimed more than 300 victims, 250 of them high school students. When families of the victims called for an independent inquiry into the disaster, the presidential office and the ruling party agreed to their demands, but rendered the special commission toothless . Conservatives, including lawmakers from her party, took to demonizing the families as “pro-North Korea commies,” as they often do to smear critics. Ms. Park was determined to unite the country not through reason or dialogue but by brainwashing young minds. In 2015, her officials announced that middle school and high school history textbooks produced by private publishers would be replaced with government-issued ones by 2017. Many scholars condemned the plan, and international media reported the news with incredulity. When the Education Ministry finally revealed the new books this year, they were riddled with errors and right-wing bias. At least they will not be compulsory any longer .
