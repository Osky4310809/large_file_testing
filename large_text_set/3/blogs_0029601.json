But, like, charge them for it, obviously.\nArcher said she wanted to give the idea to more women to \"share the wealth,\" and a lot of replies to her tweet seem to indicate the idea might catch onâ€” until men catch on, that is.\n@maggiearch3r I hope this doesn't go viral too quick I'm tryna scam my way into a car\nâ€” Chelsea (@chelswds) March 25, 2017 \nOne girl even tried it, and it worked! \n@maggiearch3r you are my new hero ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/H1kOAdKK39 \nâ€” BrÃ¸Ã¸ke RÃ¸gers â„¢ (@Brooke_R13) March 26, 2017 \nHow long can this scam go on before either everyone knows about it or people drown in their own guilt? \nWATCH: Behold the newest food trend is a sushi donut", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T18:30:33.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
