It thought that since the Galaxy S6 edge was more expensive than the Galaxy S6, customers were going to prefer the latter more. That didn’t turn out to be the case. It became evident soon after launch that customers preferred the more expensive but arguably more stylish Galaxy S6 edge with its dual-edge curved display. Samsung missed out on a lot of potential sales because it just didn’t have enough supply of the Galaxy S6 edge to meet demand . \nThe company knew what it had to do the following year. It produced more units of the Galaxy S7 edge than the Galaxy S7 and the results speak for themselves. According to several estimates, almost 70 percent of all Galaxy S7 sales are accounted for by the dual-edge curved variant . As Samsung gears up to launch its next-generation flagship smartphone in about a month or so, many expect the Galaxy S8 Plus to outperform the Galaxy S8. \nHowever, it’s not going to be that simple this year because both the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus are going to feature a dual-edge curved display . Their size is what will set them apart. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are believed to feature a 5.7-inch and 6.2-inch display respectively. Samsung is reportedly placing its bets on the Galaxy S8 Plus to be the clear winner but since both models are likely to have similar specs, it will be consumer preference that decides which variant takes the cake. \nAn industry official cited in a recent report claims that Samsung has set the production rate in favor of the Galaxy S8 Plus, it’s prioritizing production of the larger model because it believes that consumers will opt for it in far greater numbers than the smaller Galaxy S8. \nThe cost will obviously be a factor as well. Will customers be willing to pay at least $100 more for a device that just has a bigger display when you can get the exact same look and feel at a lower cost? Moreover, it’s not like 5.7-inch is a small display by any means, that’s what the Galaxy Note 7 was touting last year so the Galaxy S8 will firmly be inside phablet territory anyway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:12:54.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
