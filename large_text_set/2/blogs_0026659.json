Emma plays Mia in the movie , and though she partakes in plenty of dancing acts, the one set in front of a lit-up Los Angeles seems especially romantic. Costume designer Mary Zophres spoke to Fashionista about her wardrobe choice for the scene , explaining that she was inspired by an Atelier Versace gown Emma wore to promote The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in 2014: \n\"It's stunning on Emma and I pitched [that color] to [director Damien Chazelle] for that sequence. We had our first fitting and Emma started spinning around in this dress. She loved it. I loved it. She and I thought at the same time, 'Why don't we just use this fabric?'\" \nAfter hiring Rob Phillips to hand-paint florals onto the fit-and-flare, the look was just as flattering as Zophres imagined it. Read on to see the La La Land costume once more, then check out the red carpet number that inspired it, along with more of Emma's recent appearances in yellow. One thing's for sure: regardless of the silhouette or occasion, Emma looks downright gorgeous in the shade — the same goes for her new character, Mia.
