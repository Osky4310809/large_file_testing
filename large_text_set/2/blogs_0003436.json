achievement: Her Majesty the Queen Bethany Clarke/Getty Images \nThe Queen makes history on Monday by becoming the first British monarch to reach their Sapphire Jubilee. \nFebruary 6 marks 65 years since Elizabeth II's accession to the throne, but there are no grand festivities planned to mark Her Majesty's milestone. \nThe Queen is not due to be out and about on official engagements on the landmark day. \nAs is usual on Accession Day, she will be spending it privately at her Sandringham Estate in Norfolk . \nShe was in good spirits on Sunday as she greeted well-wishers after attending a church service at St Peter and St Paul in West Newton, Norfolk.

Those present included foreign royalty, UK Lords, heads of state, and MPs from the Queen's various legislatures ITV/Rex 5/17 Route from the Palace \nThe Queen proceeded through London from Buckingham Palace, through Trafalgar Square, and towards Westminster Abbey in the 'Gold State Coach' ITV/Rex \nThe Queen seen during her Coronation tour in October 1953 Daily Mail 7/17 Head of State \nThe Queen inspects guard of Highland Light Infantrymen at Hampden Park, Glasgow, during her Coronation visit to Scotland in 1953 8/17 Party time \nChildren with party hats and blowing trumpets at a street party in Morpeth Street, in London's East End, to celebrate the coronation Getty Images 9/17 Royal couple \nThe Queen wears the Imperial State Crown as she and the Duke of Edinburgh - dressed in the uniform of Admiral of the Fleet - wave from the balcony of Buckingham Palace to the crowds 10/17 Coronation fever \nChildren in the East End of London reading a poster announcing a forthcoming party to celebrate the coronation Hulton Deutsch Collection/Corbis 11/17 Long May She Reign \nAs the Queen drove down the Old Kent Road she was presented with a bouquet by Mary Milledge aged 5 Daily Mail \nThe Queen seen smiling from the carriage after her coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey 13/17 Display of power \nThe Queen made her Coronation Review of the greatest display of Britain's air power ever assembled, at Oldiham Airfield, Hampshire. Nearly 1.000 planes and 4,000 officers, airmen and airwomen took part, including representatives of the Commonwealth. The programme included a fly past of 639 aircraft which had taken off from 42 different airfields. Among the planes were many of the latest jets 14/17 Procession \nThe royal carriage passes along Victoria Embankment on its way to Westminster Abbey AFP/Getty Images \nUndated official portrait of the Queen shortly after her coronation AFP/Getty Images 16/17 Meeting the stars \nThe Queen shakes hands with Brian Donlevy, Valentina Cortesa, Peter Finch, Mona Freeman and Stewart Granger at the 'Beau Brummell' film premiere at the Empire Theatre, London, on November 15, 1954 Harry Myers/Rex 17/17 Coronation tour \nThe State Banquet in Canberra, Australia, in February 1954.

William, Kate and Harry join London Marathon training session \nThe Queen, who missed church over Christmas due to a heavy cold, will undoubtedly be matter of fact about the historic occasion. \nIn 2015, when she thanked the nation for the kind messages after overtaking Queen Victoria to become the longest-reigning monarch in British history, she admitted bluntly that the royal record was \"not one to which I have ever aspired\". \nShe added: \"Inevitably, a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception.\" \nThe Queen celebrated her 90th birthday last year and had a busy schedule commemorating the occasion, with a walkabout, beacon lighting and a black tie dinner for family and friends in Windsor on her actual birthday. \nA weekend of national celebrations, including a party on The Mall, was held for her official birthday in June. \nIt is likely that any large-scale jubilee celebrations will be reserved for the Platinum Jubilee in 2022 - although any events will take into account the fact that Queen is due to turn 96 that year. \nThe Duke of Cambridge is about to become a full-time royal this summer and will increase his official duties on behalf of the Queen.
