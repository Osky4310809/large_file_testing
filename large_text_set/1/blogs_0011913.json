So sad 2 hear of the untimely death of @barnetbugle Dan Hope. An honest highly intelligent politician & journalist who I will miss. RIP — Cllr Dr Devra Kay (@LaBloggeuse) January 12, 2017 \nClose friend and Barnet councillor Mark Shooter told the Standard: “He was a quiet man, a very deep thinker, very firm in his views on politics and which direction the council should be going in. \n“He was a die-hard Conservative, spent his whole life promoting transparency in the council. \n“Barnet Council was his life. He came to every council meeting to film and upload them on his website. \n“He had a brilliant mind. I never met anyone so clued up not only on local politics but on the bigger picture.” Rest in peace Daniel. Will miss you.

Shocked, devastated to hear of death of Daniel Hope, former Barnet cllr and man behind @barnetbugle . A mensch who was always fair and honest — Marcus Dysch (@MarcusDysch) January 12, 2017 \n“But over the years, we ended up collaborating, and he would often use my council films when he couldn't make the meetings. \n“Dan was always very sociable, always had an opinion, and would happily spend the time after meetings chatting with councillors of all parties, often at the Greyhound pub in Hendon. \n“I will miss him, his sense of humour, and his insightful political knowledge.” So sad about death of Dan Hope @barnetbugle . We were in different political parties but worked together on anti-racism since mid 1990's — Jeremy Newmark (@Jeremy_Newmark) January 12, 2017 \nOther Barnet bloggers also paid tribute. \nNot the Barnet Times, posted: “Daniel was the father of Barnet’s bloggers. \n“His legacy will be that he stood up for what he believed in, and would not be bullied into silence or submission, as were so many councillors seeking to climb the greasy pole of higher allowances.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T05:40:25.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
