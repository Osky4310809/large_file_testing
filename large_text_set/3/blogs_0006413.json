The most popular are CH family drones, which have been sold to 10 countries’ armed forces. \nCASIC’s drones are different to other Chinese UAVs, resembling cruise missiles instead of fixed-wing planes. Its drones are launched from a vehicle and retrieved after descending by parachute. \nThe development plans are part of CASIC's goal of becoming a world-class provider of drones and related services, according to Wei. If it is successful, it could take market share from the US and Israel through cheaper technology and a willingness to sell to countries that Western states are hesitant to deal with. \nThe company is aiming to reach its targets within the current five-year plan which ends in 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T14:58:39.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
