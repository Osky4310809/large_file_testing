Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017 \n\nThe article noted Tillerson’s business acumen , and his ability to run “operations in some of the most inhospitable parts of the world, from ice-encrusted Sakhalin in the Russian Far East, to poverty-stricken Chad.”\nMusk, who runs Tesla Motors, had a similar rational for saying Tillerson had the potential to be an excellent Secretary of State. In a follow-up tweet, Musk explained that “Rex is an exceptionally competent executive.”\n@danahull Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017 \n\nLike Tillerson, Musk also has the president’s ear . Musk was added to his business advisory forum known as Trump’s Strategic and Policy forum.
