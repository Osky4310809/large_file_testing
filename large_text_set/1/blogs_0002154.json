But the expected conservative pick “would not fundamentally shift the court’s balance of power,” Politico noted. \n“You’re basically dealing with a situation where, no matter what conservative you put on the court, you’re establishing the same parity that existed,” a transition official involved in the selection process told the website. \n“That is first and foremost in everybody’s minds.” \nNow, the Trump team is already discussing candidates for future vacancies, Politico reported, which points out liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83 and swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy is 80. \nAs noted above, there’s a decent chance Trump won’t only be replacing Antonin Scalia. \nJust remember these three words, Mr. President-elect… \nKeep.
