Not only for dominatrixes , scorned lovers , and governments , but also, sadly, racists. \nBecause of Islam’s dietary restrictions on pork, it doesn’t take much creativity for a racist asshole to buy an affordable piece of meat and use it to desecrate a place of Muslim worship. \nFor instance, last year, a hooded man in London threw “rotten” pork meat at a mosque at 4 AM, presumably as a way to protest a growing Muslim population in Britain. Well, it seems that an equally unoriginal and racist woman has used bacon to desecrate an Islamic center in Yolo County, California.

Kirk-Coehlo is also looking at a maximum of six years in prison, if convicted. Both state and federal prosecutors are calling it a hate crime. In other words, do not fuck with Islamic centers in Yolo County, where authorities were tipped off by the public after surveillance footage was released. \nBut her alleged crimes go beyond wrapping bacon around the handle of the entrance to the Davis Islamic Center. She has also been charged with doing more than $7,000 in damage, smashing six window panes, and destroying two bicycles. \nThe pork-on-the-mosque bit is also used outside of Europe and the US. In January, a pig’s head was found at a Quebec City Islamic center, the same mosque that ended up being the target of a lone wolf terrorist attack weeks later, where six members were shot and killed. \nClearly, these acts of hatred are about way more than food.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:13:55.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
