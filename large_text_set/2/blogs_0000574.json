Hermione from Harry Potter.\nDimensions' The Goonies pack adds both a fresh level and adventure world to the sprawling toys-to-life game. You also get a minifigure of Chunk, plus a pirate ship and skeleton organ to build.\nNext up, the Lego City pack gives you a Lego City Undercover-themed adventure world, which seems a little superfluous if you're also interested in the main game's upcoming HD re-release , but still.\nThe pack also gives you a Chase McCain minifig, which I'm on board with, and a dinky Lego helicopter.\nFinally, there's Hermione from Harry Potter. There's nothing wrong with her character, but she only unlocks the Harry Potter adventure world, which fans will likely already have access to via the Harry/Voldemort set.\nStill, every set, including Hermione's, has its own local multiplayer arena if you're into that side of things.\nBefore the above, Lego Dimensions is just days away from getting its Lego Batman Movie Story Pack and Knight Rider additions.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/14wXXsOU55k"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:21:17.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
