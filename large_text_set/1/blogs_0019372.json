Fucking. DELUSIONAL! \nOn Monday, Donald Trump hosted a reception for House and Senate leaders where some of the attendees included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , House Speaker Paul Ryan , and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy . \nRelated: Here Are Donald Trump's First Three Executive Orders! \nHowever, instead of talking about issues that could positively affect America's future, the businessman spent a good chunk of time complaining about how he lost the popular vote in the election to Hillary Clinton ! \nAccording to sources, Melania Trump 's husband blamed his loss due to 3-5 MILLION illegal votes! However, there is no evidence of voter fraud, especially on the scale that Trump is suggesting. \nIn case you forgot, Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million ballots. \nWhen asked about the meeting, Kevin McCarthy confirmed to press that Donald kept yapping on and on about the election. \n\"We talked about different electoral college, popular vote going through the different ones… Well, we talked about going back through past elections. Everyone in there goes through elections and stuff so everybody's giving their different histories of different parts.\" \nIn the words of Idina Menzel … LET IT GO, dude !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:21:48.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
