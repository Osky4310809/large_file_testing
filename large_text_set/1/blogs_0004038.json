Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMake no mistake, Fifth Harmony are going nowhere as they've released their first official photo after Camila Cabello quit the band last year. \nWhile it's more like Fourth Harmony, without their fifth member, the girls look sassy as ever for the festive shoot. \nTweeting the sultry pic with just: “Twenty seventeen”, it seems the girls are ready to tackle the new year and new start. \nFollowing Camila's not-so-shocking exit, the band said that they were “so excited for what the new year brings”. And so are we. (Photo: Twitter/Fifth Harmony) \nHer decision to quit Fifth Harmony stunned music fans in December but there had been signs beforehand that Camila may have preferred to work solo. \nThe popstar left fans heartbroken when she walked away from the group that made her famous four years ago. \nBut now an interview published a few months before her dramatic exit hints that Camila was happier working solo on her own songwriting, away from the chaos of life on the road. https://www.instagram.com/p/BOitpkEAk27/embed \nShe told V Magazine in August 2016: “I think songwriting was the biggest way that I found my identity.\" \nCamilla added: “It’s hard to know who you are when you start doing that stuff, and songwriting has helped me stay sane throughout this whole thing.” \nThe 19-year-old told the mag a particular highlight of the year had been releasing the track ‘I Know What You Did Last A Summer’, duet with popstar Shawn Mendes. \n“I felt like that was the first time I got to show people who I am and the music that I was writing while we were doing the mall tours - all the sh***y demos on my laptop that nobody knew I was doing,” she said.

We wish her well,” read the post. \nThat kicked off a war of words between Camila and the group: she insisted they’d known for a while she wanted to leave, while the band suggested that wasn’t the case.

Saying that they were just informed through my representatives that I was ‘leaving the group’ is simply not true.” \n\"Just like the other girls said in their statement about their plans, I had also planned to continue with my own solo endeavours in the New Year, but I did not intend to end things with Fifth Harmony this way,” she added. \nThe group, however, hit back with a statement of their own disagreeing with Camila’s take on the situation. \n“Over the past several months we have consistently made every effort to sit down and discuss the future of Fifth Harmony with Camila,” they said. \n“We have spent the past year and a half (since her initial solo endeavor) trying to communicate to her and her team all of the reasons why we felt Fifth Harmony deserved at least one more album of her time, given the success of this past year that we’d all worked so hard for.\" https://www.instagram.com/p/BOObdQXgIPU/embed \n\"We called for group meetings which she refused, we asked L.A. Reid and the label to step in and try to set meetings, which again, she refused. We even went as far as group counseling which she did not show up to. So no, after months of rejection from her and her team, these supposed lengthy conversations in fact never happened, although we pleased. \n\"We have tried with exhausted efforts and hearts to keep this group alive as the five of us, and we want it to be very clear that unfortunately those efforts were not mutual.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T01:44:52.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
