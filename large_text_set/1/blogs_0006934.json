The singer is actually ‘trying hard not to fall head over heels’ with Drake, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned. Here’s the scoop! \nMaybe it’s better not to put all your eggs in one basket. “ Jennifer [ Lopez ] is trying hard not to fall head over heels for Drake ,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “ She has NOT been gushing about her new romance to friends or family, and instead has been trying to play it all cool. She wants to keep things between them easy, light and fun.” Hey, no harm in that! There’s no need to rush to put a label on things if both people in the relationship are happy! \nAnd when we say happy, that’s actually an understatement. The new couple are clearly OVER THE MOON for each other, as they were spotted giggling like teenagers over a romantic dinner at Nobu in Malibu.

They started out coy, but now it’s full steam ahead. Jennifer Lopez & Ex-BF Casper Smart — Cute Pics \nIt’s all rainbows and butterflies right now, but for how long?
