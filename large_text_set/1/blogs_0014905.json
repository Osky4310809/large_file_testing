So, what would have happened if Barton had joined The Gunners? Share This could have actually happened… apparently (Photo: MirrorSport)   \nBefore you ask… no, we're not making this up. Joey Barton really has suggested that there was once a chance of him joining Arsenal. \nYes, REALLY. \nAccording to the Burnley midfielder, Arsene Wenger had pencilled in a meeting with the then Newcastle midfielder in 2011 - but Barton blew the audition after a clash with Gervinho saw the Arsenal man sent off. \n\"There was definitely some low-level interest,\" Barton told Four Four Two and before I got sent off against Arsenal, when the thing with Gervinho happened, I was due to hold some form of discussions with them. But then it never came to be.\" The Gervinho scuffle that (apparently) scuppered Joey Barton's Arsenal discussions \n\"Would I have liked to have played for Arsenal? Of course. Who wouldn’t?\" \nNo kidding, Joey. But, aside from making football fans everywhere believe anything is possible, what else would have happened if this seemingly bizarre move had happened. \nWe have some thoughts… 1. Arsenal fans would have been torn. On the one hand, they would have had the tough tackling midfielder they always wanted... (Photo: Arsenal FC via Getty) 2. On the other hand, they would have had Joey Barton in their side. So… 3. Santi Cazorla - who signed for The Gunners in 2012 - might never have joined the club. (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane / Getty) \nBecause when you have Joey Barton in your midfield, why would you need this adorable little guy? 4. In fact, if you believe everything Harry Redknapp says (ahem), a Barton signing might have seen Cazorla end up at TOTTENHAM (Photo: David Price) \n\"Santi Cazorla was very nearly a Tottenham player well before he joined Arsenal,\" claimed 'Arry. \"Santi wanted to come. He was happy to join Spurs but there was a breakdown in talks over the fee. The deal was almost done but it got lost somewhere in the negotiations between Tottenham and Villarreal. \n\"It was a transfer that could and should have been done. He ended up being another one who got away.\" \nIt's OK, Gooners. It never happened. Santi doesn't play for Spurs. Relax. 5. A few years into his Arsenal career, Barton would have advised his manager against splashing the cash on a potential big signing \nHmm… 6. England's Euro 2012 midfield would almost certainly have been built around Joey Barton (Photo: Getty Images) \nFact: if you are an Englishman playing for Arsenal (rather than Newcastle or QPR), you are are far more likely get into the England team. \nIn Barton's case, that would have meant the world watching him chase after Andrea Pirlo during the England vs Italy Euro 2012 quarter-final… which would have been entertaining if nothing else. 7. We would have been robbed of one of the Premier League's great meltdowns (Photo: Getty) \nIf Barton had joined Arsenal, he wouldn't have signed for QPR, which meant he wouldn't have been playing in the \"AGUE \" title decider, when he completely, totally, absolutely lost it. \nFor those of you who don't remember, Barton got sent off, hit Aguero as he left the field, squared up to Martio Balotelli and finally had to be dragged away but not one, but two QPR coaches.
