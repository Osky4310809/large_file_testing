Ownership announced the news this afternoon, writing on Facebook that “it’s time for new adventures.” \nWe've had a absolute BLAST these past 7 years, but it's time for new adventures! Three Aces will be closing forever this... Posted by Three Aces Chicago on 14hb Februari 2017 Owners Lyle Aker, Anthony Potenzo and team also run Charlatan, their pasta-focused Italian sister restaurant in West Town that opened in 2014 . The announcement doesn’t appear to affect them. Three Aces’ patio will be open over the weekend to give patrons one last chance to enjoy the outdoor space as its presently constituted. The restaurant gave Little Italy a shot in the arm when it opened in 2010, winning over critics with chef Matt Troost’s unique bar menu. The rock and roll ambience created a special destination luring locals, UIC students and more. Troost is also the chef over at Charlatan. Ownership wasn’t immediately reached for comment. DNAinfo first noticed the announcement. Stay tuned for any updates if they become available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:19:14.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
