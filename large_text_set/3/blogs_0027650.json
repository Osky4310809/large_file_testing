Marco Verratti could leave Paris Saint-Germain in the off-season. Source: Supplied \nPoised to cruise into the last eight of the Champions League following a sensational 4-0 rout of Barcelona in the first leg of their last 16 clash, PSG were dramatically overhauled 6-1 in the second leg less than a fortnight ago. \nIt was hailed as one of the most remarkable comebacks in sport, but left Verratti with doubts over his commitment to Unai Emery’s side. \nReports in Italy claim Verratti, who has never played in Serie A, could join Juventus, while Chelsea and Barcelona have been strongly linked to the playmaker more recently. \nOn their way to a record sixth consecutive Serie A title, the Turin giants will also meet Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals. \nBut Di Campli added: “There are a few interested (clubs) in Italy, but I have doubts that will be his final destination. \n“It’s not about money: whichever club takes Verratti will pay him well. Because, I can tell you this for certain: if he leaves PSG it will be for a top European club.” \nAsked if Verratti would head to Spain, England or Germany, his agent said: “A top European club.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
