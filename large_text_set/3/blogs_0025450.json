  \nWales and Ireland played out a hard-fought 0-0 draw in Dublin which does little to help the World Cup hopes of either. \nThe game, played out in front of a boisterous atmosphere at the Aviva Stadium, ended with Wales hanging on and down to 10 men, after Neil Taylor's red card for a shocking challenge on Seamus Coleman. The Irish captain now looks set to miss the rest of 2017, with a horrific leg break. \nBefore then, it had been a feisty affair, with Wales desperate for three points, having won only one of their four qualifiers so far. \nBut on a night when Gareth Bale couldn't quite find his best, they were kept at arm's length by a well-drilled Ireland side - who themselves went close to winning it late on, through James McClean. \nHere are five things we learned... 1. Post-Euro struggles continue for Wales Wales have not found the balance right since the Euros (Photo: REUTERS) \nHeroes at Euro 2016, but now Wales face a real uphill struggle to claim a place at the World Cup next year. \nChris Coleman's men are still to be beaten in qualifying, but have drawn four of their five matches, and continue to trail Ireland, Serbia and now Austria. \nNow heading into matches as favourites, Wales aren't quite finding the balance quite right. \nThe surprise factor has now very much gone, and it's leaving them looking at a summer off in 2018, rather than one spent in Russia. 2. No club loyalties here Whelan and Allen, Stoke teammates, square up (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nJoe Allen spoke in the build up to the game and said that he and Stoke teammate Glenn Whelan wouldn’t be giving an inch in their midfield battle. And he wasn’t wrong. \nOn the stroke of half-time the man called ‘Jesus’ by his Wales pals flicked the ball past his club colleague and tried to retrieve it the other side. \nOnly Whelan, and specifically his elbow, had other ideas; beaten, he hung it back and stealthily dropped the ex-Liverpool man. \nUnderstandably, Allen was furious. Whelan, comically, argued the toss. The two even went head to head as the referee blew for half-time. \nIt was about as exciting as the first half got. 3. Bale's frustration Bale will now miss the trip to Serbia through suspension (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nGareth Bale has done some job lifting Wales on his shoulders in the past 18 months or so, playing for the team and being THE reason why Coleman's outfit are greater than the sum of its parts. \nBut, perhaps for the first time tonight, there were signs that it is starting to weigh down the Real Madrid superstar. \nBale so often fills two roles in this Wales side; the chief creator and the main finisher. But with qualification not quite going to plan, the signs were there that he was becoming frustrated by those around him. \nA lunge at a clearing John O'Shea saw him booked in the second half, which now means he misses the game in Serbia. He could also have seen a second yellow for a challenge on McClean later on. \nThat said, there was a moment late on when he went on a one-man mission and almost fired into the top corner from 25 yards, when surrounded by Irish defenders. \nHowever, it was a largely frustrating night for the Welsh ace. And that frustration is now showing. 4. Ireland have heart, but lack creation O'Neill and the Irish brain's trust need to find a little more creative spark (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) \nMartin O'Neill's men are well placed at the halfway mark in qualification, but know that with a little more ingenuity, they'd almost be booking their plane tickets to Russia. \nIreland were all heart, all energy in attack, and organised well defensively. \nBut in the absence of Robbie Brady and veteran playmaker Wes Hoolahan, they lacked a little bit of X factor. \nThat's something that O'Neill could desperately do with finding. 5. Get well soon Seamus Seamus Coleman is taken off on a stretcher (Photo: PA Wire) \nNeil Taylor isn’t a dirty player. He's a solid, honest pro. \nBut this was an awful tackle from the Aston Villa defender. \nNow Everton defender Seamus Coleman faces being out of action for a considerable period. It was little wonder Sky Sports in England and RTE in Ireland both refused to show a replay of the incident. \nIt was a horrendous lunge from Taylor, that left him visibly upset as he walked off the pitch following his red card. \nNow the important thing isn't to vilify him, but rather to hope Coleman gets well soon.
