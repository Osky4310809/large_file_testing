The march resulted in violent clashes in which at least 30 people were injured. Journalists covering the incident were slapped, punched and kicked by policemen, all of them reportedly without nameplates.\n(Photos by Anindya Chattopadhyay)\nTOI correspondent Somreet Bhattacharya and photographer Anindya Chattopadhyay , Times Now reporter Priyank and cameraman Mazhar Khan and several other journalists were beaten up by these policemen, who also snatched away phones and cameras and deleted photos and videos. A TOI intern shooting a video was also beaten up.\nWhen my colleague shared photographs:\nWhen my colleague Anindya Chattopadhyay shared some of the photos at around 10pm, a few of them stood out. One was this image of people being assaulted by cops and lying on the streets, a placard that said ‘Long Live Freedom of Speech’. In trampling a free press, it seemed this was one freedom that was stepped upon. While there can be debates on how free the press is, in India, by and large, the media has served as a strong fourth pillar to a vibrant and young democracy. And such actions naturally lead to outrage in the journalist fraternity.\nMedia bashing has turned from figurative to literal. A lot of times public ire, and that of the police and prashasan (administration), is directed at the journalists covering an event. And social media seems to be adding fuel to fire – the outrage machine can be seen on in full swing on platforms like Twitter. And no matter what the object or issue, the media seems fair game.\nI have often wondered why jibes like ‘presstitutes’ fly thick and fast each time a side, community or party doesn’t agree with what has been said or reported. It is all too easy to single out a specific report, a paragraph or a line taken out of context, but does anyone, in all fairness, judge the track record or a journalist, a newspaper, a website, a channel and pass judgement based on their track record. It is almost fashionable to blame all that plagues our society on some sensational report that been done by a channel or an article by a reporter. But when social media outrages are amplified beyond measure, the results are cacophonous.\nMany colleagues have suggested that ignoring the cacophony of trolls is the best way to deal with them. I’m not certain I agree any more. Silence is seen as a sign of weakness and it seems to embolden those making these vicious attacks.\nMountains out of molehills\nWithout doubt, a responsible media is one which is committed to the integrity of news, and has checks and balances in place to ensure that the news isn’t deliberately twisted or skewed. On the flip side, responsible members of society should not vent their anger at the media when the news is inconvenient or doesn’t match their views. There also seems to be a natural distrust towards any coverage without examining the situation in detail. A coin has two sides, but a story has many – what we choose to see and focus on is as much a function of our socialization as it is of what is reported. Who we are influences not only how we see but also what we choose to see.\nA recent example close is how a tribute video produced by the TOI online staffers in Noida on International Mother Language Day has had such an outpouring of adverse reactions for the unfortunate, albeit inadvertent, exclusion of Kannada, that my colleagues who work in the print edition in Bangalore are feeling threatened.\nTo both those who felt offended, and to those who’ve had to seek police protection in the face of public ire – I unequivocally apologise.\nIt is ironical that a Bengali misjudged how importantly identity is associated with a mother tongue on ‘International Mother Language Day’. After all, on February 21 in 1952 students from the University of Dhaka, demonstrating for the recognition of Bangla as one of the two national languages of East Pakistan, were brutally shot dead by police – and ‘Bhasha Dibas’ has been part of a Bengali’s psyche long before the UN recognised the day.\nMedia and the people who work there aren’t from Mars\nWe look at situations, events, and interpret what other people say and do, as per our own set of past experiences, culture, values and, dare I say religious beliefs. In that, people struggle to empathize with the perspectives of others. Newspapers, TV channels, websites are all reflections of the society that exists and if people don’t like what they see then perhaps it is also time to introspect.\nA 2015 international report named India among the three most dangerous countries for media personnel. Our country is only lower than war-torn Iraq and Syria. India is the deadliest nation for reporters in Asia, more than Pakistan or Afghanistan. Since 1992, over 60 journalists have been killed in India with reporters exposing corruption the most hunted, says a compilation by the Committee to Protect Journalists. In this milieu, the scribes and lens men who go on doing their jobs the best they can, need to be applauded and not abused.\nTo anyone who will lend me an ear, this is a journalist’s rant: Question but don’t blindly condemn. Stick to your beliefs but entertain contrarian views. And above all, don’t generalise and tar an entire profession. News needn’t be convenient.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTimesofIndia%2Fvideos%2F10155117722427139%2F&show_text=0&width=560", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fanindya.chattopadhyay.9%2Fposts%2F10154747821444550&width=500"], "published": "2017-02-23T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:58:07.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
