Another candidate, Nadeem Qureshi, shared similar concerns with the Hill Times newspaper.\nTrudeau was asked about the controversy earlier Thursday before Nathan’s announcement, suggesting conflicts are part of an open nomination progress.\n“People will try and speculate and create conflicts, but ultimately I have a tremendous amount of faith in the local Liberal membership,” Trudeau told a B.C. news conference.\nRelated John Ivison: Liberals aren’t the most open party — and for non-chosen ones that’s a ‘slap to the mouth’ John Ivison: Democracy, Liberal style, returns in nomination battle for vacant Ontario riding Rex Murphy: Can a man who ignores his promise of open nominations credibly claim to be a great reformer? The seat became vacant when Immigration Minister John McCallum quit to become ambassador to China.\nBraeden Caley, a spokesman for the Liberal party, said all aspects of the nomination process have been in line with the national nomination rules.\n“After the Hon. John McCallum’s announcement that he was leaving Parliament, there was an additional five-week period for new supporters to register as Liberals and participate in an open nomination vote in addition to the eligible registered Liberals who have been involved for many months or years.”\nNathan’s statement added that Liberals in the riding have been “robbed of their ability to have a fair say in selecting a candidate of their choice to represent their party in the upcoming byelection.”\nNathan’s departure leaves three candidates vying for Saturday’s nomination.\nThe byelection will be held April 3.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T05:45:19.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
