winning the 1966 World Cup final against West Germany England are in action against old rivals Germany in an international friendly in Dortmund on Wednesday night and it is a fixture with plenty of history. \nThe two countries have tasted victory against each other in World Cups and European Championships. \nHere, we pick out 10 classic encounters from the pastâ€¦ Harry Kane has been tipped to succeed Wayne Rooney as England captain \nGermany 3 England 6 (Berlin, May 14 1938) \nA match made infamous by the England players' Nazi salute during the pre-match national anthems. Consequently, the thumping England dished out to their hosts over the 90 minutes that followed is often overlooked. Cliff Bastin, Jackie Robinson (two), Frank Broome, Stanley Matthews and Len Goulden were England's scorers that day in what was the final meeting between the two countries prior to the outbreak of war 16 months later. \nEngland 4 West Germany 2 (London, July 30 1966) \nThe 1966 World Cup final was the fifth meeting between England and West Germany since 1950. Having won the previous four, Sir Alf Ramsey's men were firm favourites to lift the Jules Rimet trophy and were almost winners inside 90 minutes before Wolfgang Weber took the match to extra-time. A Soviet linesman offered England a helping hand when he ruled Geoff Hurst's header had crossed the line, but there was no doubt over the West Ham striker's hat-trick goal, which set the seal on a famous victory. Gerd Muller celebrates his winner againstEngland at the 1970 World Cup \nWest Germany 3 England 2 (Leon, June 14 1970) \nThere was revenge for West Germany at the next World Cup as they came from two goals down to knock out the reigning champions in Mexico. Alan Mullery and Martin Peter put England in charge but Peter Bonetti's mistake let the opponents back into the game and with Bobby Charlton withdrawn after 70 minutes, the German side completed the turnaround through Gerd Muller's extra-time winner. \nWest Germany 1 England 1 (Turin, July 4 1990) \nA memorable World Cup semi-final that started England's shootout phobia. On the hour, Andreas Brehme's free-kick was deflected off Paul Parker and over Peter Shilton for the opener. Gary Lineker equalised after 80 minutes before a goalless period of extra-time resulted in penalties. Lineker, Peter Beardsley and David Platt were all on target for England, but misses by Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle booked West Germany's passage to the final. Gareth Southgate after missing his penalty for England at Euro '96 \nEngland 1 Germany 1 (London, June 26 1996) \nFootball looked to be coming home when Alan Shearer gave Terry Venables' team the lead within three minutes but it proved to be more penalty heartache for the Three Lions. Stefan Kuntz soon equalised and though England had the better chances in extra-time - Darren Anderton hitting the post and Paul Gascoigne inches from a winner - it fell to Andreas Moller to win it from the spot after Gareth Southgate had seen his effort saved. \nEngland 0 Germany 1 (London, October 7 2000) \nA wet, dreary day for the final match at the old Wembley, and England's players put on a performance to match the elements in a World Cup qualifier. Dietmar Hamann's low free-kick beyond a sprawling David Seaman secured the points for the Germans and sealed the fate of England manager Kevin Keegan, who announced his resignation shortly after the final whistle. Michael Owen celebrates during England's 5-1 defeat of Germany in 2001 \nGermany 1 England 5 (Munich, September 1 2001) \nThe pinnacle of Sven Goran Eriksson's time in charge. The World Cup qualifier erased the memory of defeat to Germany at Wembley 11 months earlier and was made possible by a superb hat-trick by Michael Owen. The visitors fell behind to a Carsten Jancker strike, but Owen equalised and Steven Gerrard fired England 2-1 in front before the interval. Then the floodgates opened. Owen completed his treble within 21 minutes of the restart, while Emile Heskey also got in on the act to complete the rout 17 minutes from time. \nEngland 1 Germany 2 (London, August 22 2007) \nEngland's first defeat at the new Wembley. England took an early lead through Frank Lampard, but the Germans bounced back courtesy of an error by Paul Robinson, who flapped at Bernd Schneider's cross, allowing Kevin Kuranyi to level. Christian Pander marked his international debut with a thunderous winner five minutes before the break. Frank Lampard's effort against Germany at the 2010 World Cup was ruled out \nGermany 4 England 1 (Bloemfontein, June 27 2010) \nAn emphatic World Cup win for Germany as Fabio Capello's England were picked off on the counter-attack in South Africa. Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski put Germany two up but England briefly threatened a comeback when Matthew Upson pulled one back and Frank Lampard's chip crossed the line only for the officials to claim otherwise. A second-half brace by Thomas Muller put Joachim Low's men into the last eight. \nGermany 2 England 3 (Berlin, March 26 2016) \nThe most recent meeting between the sides featured a dramatic comeback from Roy Hodgson's visitors as they wiped out a two-goal deficit to win in Berlin. Toni Kroos and Mario Gomez scored either side of half-time but Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy levelled things up before Eric Dier's header won the game for England in stoppage time. It was his first ever international goal. Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T08:43:15.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
