Ahmed Zewail of Caltech, who pioneered the study of chemical reactions on a timescales of around 10−15 seconds, was born in Egypt and died from cancer in August. In 2009, President Barack Obama made him a science envoy to encourage links between US scientists and researchers in the Middle East.\nNobel prizewinners don’t provide a perfect measure of scientific excellence: The prizes have been criticized for ignoring the contributions of important researchers, including women .\nOther measures of scientific achievement reinforce the contributions made by immigrants, however. One of the highest honors in American science is to be asked to join the National Academy of Sciences. Of the 2,294 living full and emeritus members — who must be US citizens — 26% were born abroad, NAS spokesman William Kearney told BuzzFeed News.\nTrump’s executive order also halts admissions of refugees for 120 days. One academy member, neuroscientist John Hildebrand of the University of Arizona in Tucson, told BuzzFeed News that he owes a personal debt to refugees who fled to the US to escape persecution by the Nazis. “My own teachers won Nobel prizes in this country after being driven out of their own countries,” he said.\nThe academic petition argues that the new immigration controls will damage American higher education and research. But scientists who oppose Trump’s executive order also have wider concerns about human rights.\n“This measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these immigrants, their families, and the communities of which they form an integral part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and un-American,” the petition states.\n“It’s not only science and technology that we’re concerned about. It’s about human decency and dignity for everybody,” Bassam Shakhashiri of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a former president of the American Chemical Society, told BuzzFeed News.\nShakhashiri came to the US from Lebanon in 1957. He became a US citizen in 1974, and vividly recalls that day: “The federal judge who swore me in as a citizen welcomed us and said, among other things: ‘Enjoy your freedoms.’”\nID: 10437028 4.\nMajor Universities Are Calling Their Students Home After The Travel Ban\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10437004 5.\nColleges Are Warning Thousands Of Muslim International Students Not To Travel\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10437014 6.\nMeet The Immigrant Scientists Spooked By A Looming Trump Presidency\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10437022", "external_links": ["http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2015/sancar-facts.html", "https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelmedia/nobelprize_org/developer/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/katie-mack-nobel-prize-physics-women-problem_us_57f35d19e4b0d0e1a9a97727", "https://www.caltech.edu/news/nobel-laureate-ahmed-zewail-named-united-states-science-envoy-1577", "https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1999/zewail-facts.html"], "published": "2017-02-01T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:19:55.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
