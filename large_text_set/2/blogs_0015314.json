But it should also shock the world how migrants and refugees in the UK have been scapegoated,” Qureshi said. \n“They have just scrapped the Dubs Agreement, and are refusing to give any guarantees to the 3 million EU nationals living in the UK, whilst creating a hostile environment for undocumented migrants. \n“Migrants are not a drain on our society, and are not bargaining chips in negotiations – they are people with lives, who make a huge contribution to Britain.” \nPrime Minister Theresa May has faced criticism for being too quick in extending an invitation to Trump just seven days after he was sworn in as president. \nBy comparison, his predecessor Barack Obama was invited to the UK 758 days after his inauguration, while George Bush waited just over two and a half years before being invited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:03:00.516+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
