The far-flung alliance of the New York–based, Long Island–born Rodin and the Tbilisi-based Ingorokva happened thanks to a mutual friend, the Georgian stylist Ketevan Gvaramadze, who dressed Rodin for the lookbook. “She is a style icon—chic and timeless. I love how gracefully she ages. To me, she’s an example and we should all be inspired by her,” Gvaramadze says about Rodin. “And this brand has no age. An 18-year-old can wear it as well as older women.” \nWhile she may be older—and at 5-foot-5, quite a bit shorter—than your typical cookie-cutter model, Rodin is hardly the first person to challenge runway conventions in a fashion capital like New York. But the idea that she appeals to Ingorokva, a designer from the small, developing country of Georgia, proves that the industry’s interest in “real people” is an international trend . \n“If you are 20 and are 5-foot-10, and you have the perfect figure and face, and all that, the clothes look great on you. You are the perfect coat hanger and it looks fantastic,” says Rodin, flashing her signature beaming smile. “But it doesn’t always translate to anybody above that age or below that height. So it is really interesting to see beautiful clothes on other people.” Rodin seems like the quintessential fit for Ingorokva’s sculpted leather jackets and crisp shirtdresses. “At my age, I’m not going to wear hot pants anymore, and I’m not going to wear a bikini. It is not that it is age-inappropriate, it is just that I don’t look great!” says Rodin, who sums up her approach to fashion with simplicity: “If you feel comfortable, then you look good.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:29:17.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
