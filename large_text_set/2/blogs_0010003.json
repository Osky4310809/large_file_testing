We’re going overboard with these Jim Bakker videos. But his show is cr zy, his guests are always happy to indulge his delusions, and it’s a break from all the awful things going on in Washington. Kind of. \nSo with that, enjoy this clip of Pastor Lance Wallnau explaining how Donald Trump knocked the “spirit of witchcraft” out of the White House. \n“What I believe is happening is there was a deliverance of the nation from the spirit of witchcraft in the Oval Office,” [Wallnau] said. “ The spirit of witchcraft was in the Oval Office, it was about to intensify to a higher level demon principality, and God came along with a wrecking ball [Trump] and shocked everyone, the church cried out for mercy and bam — God knocked that spirit out , and what you’re looking at is the manifestation of an enraged demon through the spirit.” \n… \nIf Trump had lost the election, Bakker said, America would have seen “a destruction, a total end of the church.” \n(The Spirit of Witchcraft, I assume, is the lesser known sequel to World of Warcraft.) \nIt was so inconsiderate of President Obama to leave his witchcraft around for someone else to clean up… but Trump came and tweeted it away, I guess. \nThanks, Jesus!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:12:58.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
