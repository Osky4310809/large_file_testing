Literally Everything's On Sale at Urban Outfitters Today! Literally Everything's On Sale at Urban Outfitters Share \nAlright, Urban fans, we've got great news: The retailer is offering 17% off your entire order today. Yes, that's rightâ€”everything (except gift cards), including sale items, is an extra 17% off, no code needed. Of course, we scoured the apartment category to pick out some of our fave stylish items, from new arrivals to the clearance section, for you to snag at a deeper discount. Loading Slideshow... Furniture \nOkay, let's start with furniture, shall we? The past few years has seen Urban's home goods really expand, especially in regards to chic furniture. And while we hope one day they'll have a brick & mortar home store , for now, we have to navigate the world of online only options. We're particularly loving the colorblock macrame sling chair , a clean lined velvet sofa for under $800 , and the boucherouite -style upholstered ottoman . There are also a few curvy metal pieces we'd snatch up in a heartbeat, like this wavy-based coffee table or the minimal vanity . Loading Slideshow... Kitchen & Dining \nWho says kitchenware needs to be boring? We're loving the iridescent trend , like this rainbow-hued flatware , and other colorful items like rose-tinted champagne flutes , a set of nesting bowls , and a cutting board with avocados in all hues. Loading Slideshow... Bedding & Bath \nSubtle tie dye, stripes, and texture comprise our bedding and bath picks. The soft blue duvet looks almost like an abstract sky, and this may just be the only attractive boyfriend pillow we've seen in years. Plus, you can't go wrong with a bold fouta towel , or pom pom pillow shams . Loading Slideshow...
