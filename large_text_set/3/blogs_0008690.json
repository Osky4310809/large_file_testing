( Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star ) | Order this photo By Kevin McGran Sports Reporter Sun., March 12, 2017 FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA.—They won three games in a row, and Mike Babcock saw it was good. So he gave them Sunday off. The Toronto Maple Leafs got a day in the sun. “It’s a good time for us to be on a trip,” Babcock said as the trip began in Raleigh, N.C. “Lots of vitamin D in the sun. Lots of rest. It’s important how we manage ourselves. “It’s one thing for the coach to manage it. But you’re way better when you manage yourself, how you eat, and how you sleep and how you look after yourself. That’s what gets you the energy you need.” Read more: The Leafs certainly could use some energy. They looked lethargic at times against Carolina, despite pulling off a 3-2 overtime win. The Hurricanes dominated play. Babcock has been managing their time well, cutting back on practices and skipping morning skates. The way this trip is lining up, the Leafs could end up with two days off this week, all in the keep-it-fresh approach. “We have 16 games in 30 days,” Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly, the overtime hero Saturday night, said. “We have to be ready for every single one of them, because they are all important. Big points every night. “It’s up to us, up to the training staff to make sure that we’re doing what we have to do at the rink, at home, to make sure we’re ready for all them.” Hockey players are creatures of habit. Some like their morning skates even if they are deemed less and less important by the folks with clipboards and heart monitors, whose job it is to maximize energy potential. “You have a totally different routine for the days you don’t skate,” Rielly said. “You have to manage it. You have to be able to do whatever it takes to be ready for game time, whether that means you go for a walk in the morning, you just got to do what ever it is.” The Leafs appreciate the effort management has made into managing rest to keep them at their best. “It’s really important,” winger Matt Martin said. “It’s a condensed schedule that we’ve never seen before quite like this. “Games are hard enough as it is this time of year. Any edge you can get over another team is very important, so we have to take care of ourselves.” There is plenty to do in the fun, sun and sand of Florida: Beaches, swimming pools, golf and shopping typically take up a lot of a player’s time. Scoreboard watching was at a minimum on Sunday, with the curious keeping an eye on Montreal’s game against Edmonton in the wake of the Habs losing their perch atop the Atlantic Division. None of the teams nearest the Maple Leafs in the standings are in action until Monday. Tampa Bay visits the New York Rangers, while the New York Islanders host the just-vanquished Carolina Hurricanes. This playoff talk is new ground for this young team. It itself seems to have given them a little extra jump. “We have a long way to go to reach where we want to be,” said Rielly. “This is a big road trip, a chance to make up some ground, and get some big points.” Babcock sometimes doesn’t sound as if he’s convinced the players actually need the rest the team imposes on them. He’s repeatedly pointed out how young the team is and that youth in other walks of life don’t get tired. He is an old-school coach in some ways, but embracing the new thinking nonetheless. But when he talks about it, he certainly seems to suggest he needs it proven to him that this approach is effective. “You have to be ready to play,” he said.
