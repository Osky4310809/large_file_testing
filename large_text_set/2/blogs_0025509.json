The family was slowed by the snowstorm that moved across the nation’s midsection and by the need to give Watson breaks from riding due to his injury. His doctor had told him he shouldn’t spend long periods in the car without a break.” \nWatson, who tore his ACL in January, was suspended from all team activities by Creighton last week.
