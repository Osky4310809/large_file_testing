Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is selling seats aboard its SpaceShipTwo for about $250,000, though that company hasn't yet started flying customers yet either.\nSuborbital space is just the start for Bezos.\nBlue Origin has plans to manufacture and fly multiple rockets, including a heavy-lift launcher that could bring people and payloads to the distant reaches of the solar system one day.\nBezos' vision for Blue Origin is clear.\n\"We want to see millions of people living and working in space,\" Bezos said in 2015 , and many times since then. \"It’s a worthwhile goal.\"\nWATCH: A Look Inside Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ Outside Life", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Jg_y3sXcZ8HH4WqBqqxG2kA88s0=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F431421%2F8935a525-b7b0-41fa-aeaf-c43b8898aed8.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/28rsvgx3rA6wolwp3zQTMF-vNKk=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F431417%2F3ab84734-8561-427a-8075-54be5e806bee.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CHHNdkBmFvPjFuz3pB5l2VnKAsw=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F431421%2F8935a525-b7b0-41fa-aeaf-c43b8898aed8.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B3sGTVlZONEuCKnjfz9f7dkpvfk=/http%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fthumbs%2Fr7SlMiNR.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/r7SlMiNR.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wrh7TqZlGiSWoJSx46rJE_XMHls=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F431417%2F3ab84734-8561-427a-8075-54be5e806bee.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-30T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T00:29:08.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
