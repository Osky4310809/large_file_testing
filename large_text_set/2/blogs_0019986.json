We can all agree that's vitally important, because it's not as though we've seen every part of Kim nude from every conceivable angle . \nRadarOnline posted early this morning that they'd obtained \"exclusive,\" never before seen footage of Kim's infamous 2003 romp with Ray J. They (to their credit) admit that it's from the same tape that led to the original \"Kim Kardashian Superstar\" blockbuster, and describe it as such: \nJust a selection of footage that didn’t make it into the original tape shows Kardashian unguarded, unedited, and unbelievably raunchy. \n“Somebody has to film it … we ain’t go no director!” Ray J says to the camera as then-girlfriend Kardashian laughs. \nThe erotic video continues with Ray “directing” Kardashian in a series of lewd poses. \nTopless, she proudly shows off her breasts as she writhes on the bed where many of their more hard-core scenes were filmed. \nIt's hard to say how \"unbelievably raunchy\" she is in the video, because the clip they posted is only 30 seconds long and pixelated worse than Japanese porn from the 90s. If you've seen the original tape (and who hasn't by now?), you know it's incredibly boring. It's almost as though it was planned that way by someone pulling the strings . \nThat didn't stop the news from running with it, however, most notably the U.K.'s Mirror reporting on it without running the video or providing attribution. Being a much larger source, their version of the story circulated heavily overnight, to the point where Kim's people reached out to the Daily Mail . \n\"It's not new - it's the same old tape,\" her rep said . \nAs for why all the hullaballoo, or why \"new\" footage surfaced in the first place, the very second paragraph in the Radar story explains it (emphasis mine): \nThe XXX-rated tape that launched Kardashian’s career was first released ten years ago this month , and after all this time, Vivid has uncovered never-before-seen footage – and leaked it exclusively to Radar. \nWell-played, Vivid. As seedy as they are, you can't accuse them of passing up an opportunity . Drop This Fact \n\"Kim Kardashian Superstar\" has been viewed over 150 million times and remains one of Vivid Entertainment's most profitable assets.
