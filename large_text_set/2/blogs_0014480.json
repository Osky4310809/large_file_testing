Secretary of State for Justice Liz Truss (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nNew recruits will also be offered a starting salary of £29,500 - £5,000 more than previously. Pay in London will be £500 more. \nMs Truss said: “Hard-working, dedicated staff are key to our reform agenda. \n“It’s right we offer them greater support as we move closer to transforming prisons into places of safety.” Read More 'Heroic' prison officers praised as details of HMP Birmingham riot emerge \nMs Truss is also to introduce special training programmes for staff to deal with self-harm and suicides. \nAnd prison governors will also be allowed to hire recruits locally to plug gaps in staffing more quickly. \nAmong jails to get the new money are HMP Bedford, Pentonville and Lewes. \nLast November 200 inmates went on the rampage in Bedford, at London’s Pentonville a prisoner was stabbed to death in October and there was also unrest at a wing of Lewes jail that month.
