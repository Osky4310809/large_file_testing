Pre-order and release dates for a few markets have also been mentioned in some rumors , and we’re now getting word on the Galaxy S8′s potential pre-order date in the Netherlands. \nAccording to Androidworld.nl , pre-orders for the S8 and S8+ will go live in the Netherlands on the same day the phones will be made official. It shouldn’t come as a surprise to consumers in the country, as Samsung usually puts up its flagships for pre-order in the country on launch day. The bigger question is when the phones will be sent out to consumers, and currently there is no information regarding the same. April 21st could be a possible target for the company, as that is the date the S8 is expected to be made available in South Korea . \nThe site’s sources have also suggested that Samsung will not be giving away any freebies along with pre-orders this year. That is likely to disappoint folks who had been expecting to see a few goodies being offered with the S8, especially the S8+, which will be priced higher than the S7 edge and Note 7 . Of course, pre-order bonuses will be market dependent so it is possible they will be offered in some countries. In any case, none of this information is fully confirmed and can change in the few days left before the Galaxy S8 Unpacked event, so it’s best to take everything with a pinch of salt at this point in time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:11:44.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
