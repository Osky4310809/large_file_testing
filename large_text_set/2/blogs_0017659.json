Here's an explanation of what can be expected in each class of accommodation, as well as some tips to help you choose the right class to meet your needs for a long distance train trip in India. Unreserved seating on Second Class (2S). Kay Maeritz / LOOK-foto/Getty Images Second Class (2S) \nIndia’s poorest people travel in Second Class (2S), as well as those who haven't been fortunate enough to secure a ticket in Sleeper Class. Reservations aren’t required and the concept of overcrowding really is taken to a new level. There’s sitting or standing room only, and any spare floor space is occupied by those willing to sleep on it. Most seats are simply wooden benches, although some trains do have padded benches the same as what are found in Sleeper Class. \nUnreserved Second Class is not recommended for long distance train travel in India. \ncontinue reading below our video Long-Haul Flight Survival Tips C/N N/G/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Sleeper Class (SL) \nMost of India's middle class travel in Sleeper Class. Carriages are divided into open-plan compartments with six beds in each. The beds are stacked vertically in three tiers on either side of the compartments. During the day, the middle beds must be folded down flat against the compartment walls to allow passengers to sit on the lower beds. Two tiers of beds are also located outside the compartments, along the aisle. Fans on the carriage ceiling provide some cooling, and the windows have bars to keep intruders out as they are usually kept open. The bathrooms have both western and Indian style toilets. \nThere's no privacy in Sleeper Class, and it's noisy, crowded and dirty (and that includes the toilets). However, some visitors do prefer to travel in this class so they can interact with Indians from all walks of life. Indian Railways 3AC. Will LuoFlickr/CC BY NC ND 2.0 Three Tier Air Conditioned Class (3AC) \nThree Tier Air Conditioned Class, known as 3AC, offers a significant step up in comfort and quietness. The carriages in 3AC are laid out in the same manner as in Sleeper Class. However, the windows are covered with tinted glass that’s unable to be opened, and air-conditioning keeps the carriages cool. Sheets, pillows, blankets, and towels are provided to passengers. \nPassengers tend to keep to themselves in 3AC, but privacy is still severely lacking due to the open plan nature of the compartments. (Indian Railways removed curtains from 3AC compartments in mid 2014, citing fire hazard). Most importantly, the carriages and bathrooms in usually remain much cleaner than those in Sleeper Class. Shoko Muraguchi/CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Two Tier Air Conditioned Class (2AC) \nTwo Tier Air Conditioned Class, known as 2AC, attracts India’s upper class travelers. There’s much more space, as there are only four beds in each compartment. The beds are stacked vertically in two tiers on either side. Just like in the other classes, there are also two tiers of beds along the aisle outside the compartments. Bedding and towels are also provided, the same as in 3AC. \nThe best thing about 2AC is the added benefit of privacy curtains on the entrance to each compartment, as well as across each of the beds that run along the aisle. The curtains are usually always kept drawn and this class of accommodation is quite devoid of any interaction. Jack Zalium/ Flickr/CC BY NC 2.0 First Class Air Conditioned (1AC) \nFirst Class Air Conditioned, known as 1AC, is found only on the most popular inter-state train routes. The cost is around double that of 2A and is comparable to that of flying. Compartments have lockable doors, carpet and either two or four beds, stacked vertically in tiers. Sheets, pillows, blankets, and towels are also provided. 1AC carriages also have better and cleaner bathrooms. \nThe only problem with 1AC is that it's not possible to specify if you want accommodation in a two bed or four bed compartment when you book. However, couples are normally allocated accommodations in the two bed compartments, while singles and families are accommodated in the four bed compartments. Air Conditioned Chair Car (CC) on Shatabdi Express. Prateek Karandikar/Wikimedia Commons Air Conditioned Chair Car (CC) \nAir Conditioned Chair Car carriages (CC) are commonly found on shorter distance Indian Railways trains between major cities, especially those sectors that are frequented by business travelers. Shatabdi Express trains, which are premium super fast passenger trains that connect major cities with other important cities in India (such as Delhi, Agra and Jaipur), have them. The seats recline, there is overhead space for luggage, and bathrooms tend to be relatively clean. It's a comfortable way to travel on day trips. Mumbai to Goa Jan Shatabdi 2S. Sharell Cook. Second Class Sitting on Jan Shatabdi (2S) \nUnlike normal Shatabdi Express premium trains, the Jan Shatabdi is a \"people's\" train. It has both air conditioned (CC) and non air conditioned (2S) chair classes. Travel in 2S on Jan Shatabdi trains offers perhaps the best value for money on Indian Railways. Unlike 2S seats on other trains, the seats are padded and reserved. However, they do not recline like the seats in air conditioned CC class. Side berths on Indian Railways. Jagdish Agarwal/Getty Images Indian Railways Travel Tip 1: \nThe beds are referred to as \"berths\". Where possible, always try to reserve an upper level one. They don't have to be folded down during the day like the middle level ones, or act as seats for all the passengers like the lower level ones. \nThe beds located along the aisle outside the main compartments (referred to as 'side berths') also offer a bit more personal space, and are less claustrophobic. They're great if you're traveling as a couple. However, they are enclosed at both ends and are shorter than the ones inside the compartments. As a result, they're not recommended for people who're taller than around 5 feet 10 inches. Indian Railways Travel Tip 2: \nTravel in Sleeper Class is suitable for those on a tight budget, or those who don't mind roughing it or who want to experience the 'real' India. If comfort is more of a concern, then travel in 3A is a better option. For those who require space and/or privacy, 2A or 1A is recommended.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:22.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
