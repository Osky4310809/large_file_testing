Okay, are we clear? Let’s do this. On Monday night’s episode, Jane’s husband, Michael, succumbed to injuries from being shot last season, and collapsed just before taking his LSAT exam. For fans of the series, the death was a gutpunch, especially after the couple’s emotional wedding of which the show’s creator, Jennie Snyder Urman, wrote, “I honestly don’t think I’ll ever love a moment on our show as much as I loved Michael’s vows to Jane.” Urman wrote a letter to fans on The CW show’s Tumblr account in which she praised actor Brett Dier for what he brought to the character: “I thought Michael would die earlier. But Brett is such an incredible actor — he gave us such great comedy and drama and first-rate exposition delivery (!), often all in one scene. And he and Gina… well, there’s that word again — magic.” The plan was always to kill off Michael, but shifted to occur at the end of the show’s Second Part. As Urman describes in her letter, the narrative has to pick up three years later for Part Three, because “we knew the immediate pain of that loss would overwhelm our storytelling.” Urman says they’ll “be flashing back to those three years and filling in gaps” in coming episodes. She closed her letter with this tribute to both the character and actor: “Michael will be missed in Jane’s world, just as Brett is already missed in ours.” The Best Surprise Cameos on ‘SNL’… Tell us what you think!
