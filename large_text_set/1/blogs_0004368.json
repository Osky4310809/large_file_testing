By Shannon Prather Star Tribune January 3, 2017 — 6:02pm   With an eye on equity, the Minneapolis Foundation awarded nearly $5 million in competitive grants Tuesday to 87 nonprofits, schools and organizations. Recipients included the Minneapolis Public Schools, the Minnesota Education Equity Partnership, the Somali American Parent Association, the African-American Leadership Forum-Twin Cities, the Coalition of Asian American Leaders, the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota and the Native American Community Development Institute. The missions of the recipient organizations fall into one of three categories: building a more inclusive workforce and fostering an innovative business climate; making school kids competitive in the global economy; and encouraging participation in public institutions and decisionmaking in the Twin Cities. “This year marks a critical moment in philanthropy, when an exceptionally generous community has seen great outcomes, but still has troubling challenges,” said R.T. Rybak, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Foundation. “Our community doesn’t lack compassion, but it does lack alignment. With these grants, we’re working to achieve that alignment by joining forces with a host of organizations that are committed to ensuring that everyone who lives here has real opportunities to succeed.” The grants range in size from $17,000 to $250,000. The foundation administers more than 1,200 charitable funds in all and awarded more than $50 million in grants in 2016.
