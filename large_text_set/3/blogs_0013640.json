That’s because taking prescription painkillers called opioids along with benzodiazepines can raise your risk of overdose—in fact, nearly 30 percent of fatal overdoses with opioids include a combination of the drugs , new research from Stanford found. Seems like a no-brainer not to mix the two, but prescribing both concurrently rose by 80 percent between 2001 and 2013, they found. \nCut Your Kid’s Screen Time Time to pull your kid away from his iPad. Children who spend more than three hours a day in front of electronics have higher levels of insulin resistance —a risk factor for developing diabetes—than those who spend less time in front of the screens, a new study in the Archives of Disease in Childhood found. They also had higher levels of fat, too. It’s possible that screen time can serve as a proxy for other unhealthy habits, like sedentary behavior or poor diet. \nCook Dinner Tempted to grab takeout on your way home from work? You might want to spend some time in the kitchen instead. People who cook meals themselves are more likely to meet federal guidelines for a healthy diet , researchers from the University of Washington found. What’s more, there was no increase in cost for eating a healthier diet, either. \nBuild Your Bones Think brittle bones aren’t a problem for men? Think again. While women are more likely to develop osteoporosis than men are, the effects for guys who do get it might be more serious , research from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons finds. That’s because 19 percent of men died within one year following nearly all types of osteoporosis-related fractures, compared to just 14 percent of women.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:46:12.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
