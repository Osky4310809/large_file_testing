The procedure which claims to zap unwanted fat is less invasive and uses lasers to contour the body. \nA South Jersey doctor is using it — and one of his patients is counting on it to get him in the best shape of his life. \nChris Denshuck is one of the first patients to undergo the new laser treatment at the Voorhees office of Dr. William Miller. \nChris is already in pretty good shape. The 43-year-old from South Jersey is a regular at cross fit sessions. And he rides miles everyday on his job as a police officer on a bicycle. \nDespite all that calorie-burning activity — he says there’s one problem. \n“I just want to get rid of the fat that I have stored up that I can’t get rid of no matter what I do,” says Chris. \nEven people who are super fit have stubborn fat pockets. \n“I’m getting older, I’m just not losing the weight as quickly like I was when I was younger, so I just want to be more toned,” he said. \nDr. William Miller of Voorhees has a solution for Chris. \nIt’s called Sculpsure, a laser that promises to melt body fat. \n“You can do four areas at a time,” says Dr. Miller. \nThe procedure starts with a series of frames placed around Chris’s mid-section. \nThen the lasers are attached so the laser beam stays directed at the targeted fat area. \n“The laser spreads out,” explains Dr. Miller. “It goes about one to two centimeters below the skin and basically, it’s gonna kill your fat cells.” \nChris says there’s a tingling sensation, some warmth, then cooling. \nIt’s a process that’s repeated over 25 minutes. \n“We’re seeing a significant amount of results,” says Dr. Miller who even had the procedure himself. “I had it done, I feel good.” \nResults can be seen after two months. Dr. Miller says people lose about one to two inches. \nJust hours after his treatment Chris was back working out and feeling good. \n“I’m looking to get in better shape for 2017,” he says. “I’m looking to get in the best shape of my life.” \nSkeptics say there are no independent medical studies that prove SculpSure works to melt fat. It’s currently approved by the FDA only for use on the abdomen. \nSide effects include temporary swelling, numbness and bruising. \nDr. Miller charges $1,500 per area.
