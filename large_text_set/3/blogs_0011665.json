Monopoly has held such contests in the past, but this is the first time that all the tokens were in jeopardy of being replacedâ€”even the beloved Scottie dog. Board game fans voted on their favorite tokens out of a list of 64 options, which included the classic pieces along with some more unusual options like dinosaurs, emojis, and more. Now the results are in and it looks like three of the eight tokens are being replaced with new blood. \nThe new lineup is as follows: Scottie dog, top hat, car, battleship, cat, T. rex , rubber ducky, and penguin. The boot, the wheelbarrow, and the long-mocked thimble have lost their places on the board without passing Go. The voting occurred from January 10 through 31, with fans from 146 countries casting a total of 4.3 million ballots. The new selections show a love for animals and a disinterest in old-timey (but still used!) objects. After all, who could resist a giant T. rex on the board? \nPersonally, we're just glad no emojis made the cut. \nYou will be able to see the three new tokens in the next generation of Monopoly when it comes out in August. In the meantime, you can get the Token Madness board, which comes with 16 different tokens in silver and gold.
