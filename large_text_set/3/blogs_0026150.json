Sylvain Gaboury/PMC They moved to the neighborhood after selling their historic home in the secret celebrity enclave of Snedens Landing in Rockland County for $4 million, as Gimme Shelter first reported in 2011 .\nThe couple’s newly purchased 1,340-square-foot pad at the Strathmore, at 1890 Adam Clayton Powell Blvd., has three bedrooms and two bathrooms.\nThe prewar unit has high ceilings and an open kitchen.\nAdditional features include recessed medicine cabinets in the bathrooms.\nThe building, which has a limestone exterior, a wrought iron gated entry and a marble lobby, also has modern amenities: a virtual doorman and a gym among them.\nThe listing brokers were Nest Seekers International’s Ron Ovadia and Jonathan Ortiz.\nCorcoran’s Linda Feder repped the buyers.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:25:46.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
