Turning 30 in May, the British No 1 seems destined never to win his favourite Grand Slam. \nWith Djokovic going out last week, it is the first time the top two male seeds at Australian Open went out before the quarter-finals since 2002 when Lleyton Hewiitt and Gustavo Kuerten both lost in first round. While Djokovic's conqueror Denis Istomin is coached by his mother, Zverev is coached by his father Alex Snr. \nZverev's younger brother Alex took Rafa Nadal to five sets on the same Rod Laver Court on Saturday but this time Mischa finished the job. \nThe German left-hander, who is also 29, saved a match point against John Isner in the first round before wining 9-7 in the fifth set. He broke Murray's serve eight times and deserved the win. \nThere was no hint of the drama to come in the opening games as Murray broke to lead 3-1 and had points to go to 4-1. But Zverev, who kept taking the pace off the ball to frustrate the Scot, would not go away and closed out the 63-minute first set with an ace. \nMurray quickly jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the second set before being clawed back to 3-3. The Scot failed to convert four set points at 4-5 before equalling the match up after just over two hours. They had already been 10 breaks of serve. \nBut any hopes of business returning to normal were quickly dispelled. Zverev continued his onslaught, attacking especially the Murray second serve, and he won four consecutive games from 2-2 to take the third set. \nAnd the German broke again in the first game of the fourth set when another weak Murray forehand slapped into the net. \nMurray has dug himself out of many holes over the years but not this time. The inevitable end came after three hours and 34 minutes when Zverev held his nerve and Murray pulled a forehand into the sidelines.
