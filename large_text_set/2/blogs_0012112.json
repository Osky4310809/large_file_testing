Is there anything like it? Who doesn’t remember those days and nights spent locking mouth holes with the one you swore you would love forever? \nOh, the places that you’ll hoe. \nThe places I haven’t made out at are few and far in between. I’ve let another person put their tongue in my mouth at movie theaters, bars, Forever 21 changing rooms, a bodega freezer, inside the ticket booth at Port Authority at 42nd and 8th… \nBut the closest I’ve gotten to making out on a luxury yacht would be macking on a face in a shipping container a few yards down from the port. \nSelena Gomez and The Weeknd are capable of having a tongue war on an actual yacht, however… February 11: Selena and The Weeknd enjoying a romantic evening on a yacht in Marina Del Rey, California. #1 pic.twitter.com/fyggSXedfk \n— Selena Gomez News (@LifeWithSelG) February 14, 2017 \nMarina Del Rey? More like Selena Del BAE. \nThis is probably one of the classiest Valentine’s Days ever — The Weeknd definitely has a romantic side. \nPersonally, I don’t get on a boat with any romantic interest without a life vest because I have experienced far too many failed murder attempts trying to get life insurance they have taken out on me. You live and learn.

If anything, it just showed off how butt hurt Bieber may be that his first love has moved on to someone a little bit mature. \nAnyway, do your V-Day plans include a yacht? Mine include a yacht of alcohol! Haha, get it? Like “a lot” except “a yacht.” The Weeknd gives a peek inside romantic trip with Selena Gomez To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \n\nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
