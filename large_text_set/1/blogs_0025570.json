Carly Rae Jepson debuted a new look Sunday , and girl is unrecognizable.\nThe 24-year-old Call Me Maybe singer performed during intermission at the 2017 Honda NHL All-Star Game Semifinal #1 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\nShe debuted the new ‚Äòdo while singing the Canadian national anthem. Her locks chopped into a perfect platinum pixie with long bangs, she looks like a veritable Tinkerbell .\n‚ÄúLil blonde me about to sing O Canada at the #NHLAllStar game!,‚Äù Carly Rae posted on Instagram.\nShe‚Äôd already been going shorter over recent months, but was also keeping things dark and vampy.\nMotivation: xmas baking. \nA photo posted by Carly Rae Jepsen (@carlyraejepsen) on Dec 15, 2016 at 8:51am PST \nBut now, Carly Rae Jepson has lightened it all up.

The look requires minimal upkeep, if any. She can just wash, towel dry, throw in some pomade, and go.\nHockey buds \nA photo posted by Carly Rae Jepsen (@carlyraejepsen) on Jan 29, 2017 at 6:53pm PST \nWe‚Äôre digging it. And with predecessors like Mia Farrow and Michelle Williams , Jepson‚Äôs in good company here.\nAnd she is KILLING the style. It suits her so well, we‚Äôre inclined to take our own locks under the chopping block‚Ä¶again.\nWe love that her dark roots peep from underneath, offsetting the platinum, and making her look effortlessly sun kissed.\nCall us definitely.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:47:42.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
