Overall, children consumed an average of 143 calories and 7.3% of their daily energy intake from sugary beverages, the data showed. The American Heart Association recommended in a study last year that children should consume no more than about 6 teaspoons, or 100 calories, of added sugar a day. The study, published in the journal Circulation , recommended that children should limit their intake of sugary drinks to 8 ounces weekly. Sugar recommendation: No more than 6 teaspoons per day for kids Six teaspoons a day would be less than 10% of daily calories for most children, said Dr. Miriam Vos, an associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, who was lead author of those recommendations. \"Sugar-sweetened beverages are still the top source of added sugars for children in the US and cause unhealthy weight gain,\" Vos said. \"We still have a long way to go in ensuring health for children by reducing consumption of added sugars,\" she said. The new study showed differences among age and ethnic groups. Photos: How much sugar is in that drink? Photos: How much sugar is in that drink?
