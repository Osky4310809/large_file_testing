Last year, Ranveer Singh moved to Goregaon to stay closer to his shooting location while Aditi Rao Hydari opted for a metro ride to reach an event on time. The newest celebrity to join in is Ranbir Kapoor, who has to travel all the way to Madh island to reach his shoot location (the Sanjay Dutt biopic). Seems like Jr. Kapoor is fed up of the long hours spent on the road, and he has chosen to take the jetty instead to save travel time. Apparently, the entire cast and crew also travels along with him.We totally get it, Ranbir, a two-hour road trip versus a 10-minute jetty ride anyday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:51.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
