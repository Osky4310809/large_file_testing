Talk about 2017 hair inspo! \nJennifer Lawrence stopped by Andy Cohen’s show before Christmas with a head of beach-ready long blonde perfection just days after she sported a chic textured lob while promoting her upcoming movie Passengers in Beijing . While we’ve already watched the clips a million times for the hot gossip, we also can’t help but admiring the star’s ‘do. \nIf 2016 was the year of the lob, we can definitely see JLaw’s long, flowy look being the new style. It’s hardly Lawrence’s first drastic hair change , but we can’t stop admiring it. \nCharles Sykes / Bravo / NBCU Photo Bank / Getty Images And of course JLaw would see the appeal in a whip-ready head of long hair right in time for New Year’s parties. Drunk dancing is so much more fabulous when you’re doing a sweaty-Britney-style-hair-flip every few seconds. All hair can accommodate, but long hair on the dance floor is like sparkly sequin accessories in dim lighting — it’s just better.\n\nCharles Sykes / Bravo / NBCU Photo Bank / Getty Images Boom. It’s fun, it’s flirty, and it’s a huge departure from the pixie cuts and the grown-out bobs we’ve seen Jen rock in recent years. (And psst! A keen eye can spot where her shoulder-length layers blend effortlessly into her new length.)\nThe A-lister stopped by Watch What Happens Live to talk everything from her fave Housewives , to the potentially unflattering nicknames she has for other celebs (a little shade cast by Miss Lawrence!), to her celebrity crush on …Larry David?\nJennifer folded some wispy braids back into her newly acquired layers and embraced a relaxed, bedhead wave. We are all about it.\nCharles Sykes / Bravo / NBCU Photo Bank / Getty Images After the taping she posed alongside BFF Laura in their coordinated sheer black ensembles. This is peak best-friend status.\nCharles Sykes / Bravo / NBCU Photo Bank / Getty Images Jen paired a long-sleeved top with a cutout neckline with a detailed sheer skirt — a trend she’s continually worn to junkets and premieres as the year’s come to a close. She capped off the all-black-everything with a strappy heeled sandal and minimal jewelry. We’re stealing this whole look.\nNow quick! Schedule that appointment with your hairdresser, stat! If long, back-grazing layers in 2017 is going to be the equivalent of the gray ombré look in 2016 , you’ll wanna get a move on quick before it’s everywhere . Or maybe wait till Monday. Hair stylists deserve some time off, too!\nThe post Jennifer Lawrence has long hair and we can’t wait to steal her look for 2017 appeared first on HelloGiggles .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T03:16:52.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
