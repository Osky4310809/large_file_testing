They alleged that the hoodlums were hired by an influential business man (names withheld) who, according to them, evicted some of residents after reallocating their land to strangers. \nThe protesters, who carried placards with various inscriptions, asked Ambode to invoke the Lagos Anti-land Grabbing Law on the suspects while also demanding that they be allowed back to their homes. \nThe community head, Chief Riliwan Olayiwola, 70, told Sunday Vanguard his people had cried to government on several occasions on the activities of the land grabbers. ‘’We have cried out for government intervention but it appears the hoodlums are more powerful as they have sent many of us packing by demolishing some structures and converting others to personal use. As you can see, we cannot fight government but all we want is peace to return to the land so that our people can go back home,” he said. \nOne of the protesters, who gave his name as Prince K.O. Eshinloye, said his forefathers were the owners of the vast land through inheritance. Another protester, Ayo Onigbinde, said he lost millions of Naira to the development as his property was converted by the hoodlums.
