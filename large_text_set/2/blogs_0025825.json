The government inspected 2,532 batches of baby formula in 2016, out of which 32 batches earned scores below the minimum standard. Twenty-two had safety problems and 10 had insufficiently detailed labeling. \nAddressing the situation, Bi made it clear that tighter supervision must be imposed over the process, from manufacturing to sourcing, production, sales and more. The government encourages formula manufacturers to establish their own milk sources and tighten management of production environments, equipment and procedures. Moreover, competent authorities should conduct regular spot checks, weed out violators, and recall and halt the production of sub-standard products in a timely manner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:57:09.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
