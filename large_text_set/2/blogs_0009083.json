(Photo: Trevor Ruszkowski, USA TODAY Sports) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhen Kevin Durant returns to Oklahoma City on Saturday night for the first time since his offseason departure for Golden State, all eyes will be on any and all interactions he may have with ex-teammate Russell Westbrook. \nThough this will be Durant's third time facing off against Westbrook and the Thunder — he scored 39 and 40 points, respectively, in the first two meetings, which were both blowout victories — it will be his first time back in Chesapeake Energy Arena. \nDon't expect the two superstars to square off at midcourt. \nIn a recent interview with ESPN , Durant echoed sentiments he expressed in a January interview with USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick — his \"feud\" with Westbrook is blown out of proportion. \n\"Early on in the season I was doing an interview with someone and I used the word unselfish describing my teammates, here, with the Warriors,\" Durant said. \"Someone asked Russell a question, asked if he heard what I said about being unselfish, and he phrased the question as if I was saying that the Thunder and their organization and the team was selfish.\" \nTo that question, back in October, Westbrook responded, \"That's cute, man. That's cute. My job is to worry about what's going on here. We're gonna worry about all the selfish guys we've got over here, apparently.\" Westbrook on Durant's comments this week: \"That's cute. We're gonna worry about all the selfish guys we've got over here, apparently.\" pic.twitter.com/FLjzjAZgla — Erik Horne (@ErikHorneOK) October 13, 2016 \n\"Once I heard that, I was like, 'Well, (the media is) trying to get in between this thing and make it bigger than what it is.' Obviously Russell wasn't going to hear that interview I had about me just talking about my teammates I have now,\" Durant continued. \"Someone in Oklahoma City phrased it to him as if I was calling him selfish. It's that easy. It's that easy for the media to twist something up and for the media to make a feud between us.\" \nMORE DURANT-WESTBROOK:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:31:49.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
