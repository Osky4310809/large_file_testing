It’s a handheld that’s also a console. Its controllers detach and can be used in a variety of ways. And one of its marquee games features a location called New Donk City . But one of the Nintendo Switch’s coolest features is decidedly old-school. Instead of using cumbersome spinning optical discs in a portable device (like the PSP) the Switch runs games off of SD card-like cartridges. Later this fall you’ll be able to buy Skyrim on a cartridge.\nCartridges dominated the video game home console industry in its early days before discs became the media of choice. But now that cartridges are coming back there’s no better time to thank the man responsible for the innovation, the late engineer Jerry Lawson.\nGerald “Jerry” Lawson was an engineer from Queens who taught himself engineering by repairing various electronics in his youth. While working for companies like Grumman Aircraft, Federal Electric, and PRD Electronics into the early 1970s, he encountered the huge, room-filling, militarized supercomputers that were the standard at the time. Lawson was a member of the Homebrew Computer Club, the famous Silicon Valley garage incubator that spawned folks like famous Apple gurus Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\nJerry Lawson was also a big Black guy, one of only two Black members of the Homebrew Computer Club and the first Black video game designer after the release of his early arcade game Demolition Derby . Lawson’s achievements during the birth of the games industry would be impressive no matter what. But the fact that he accomplished what he did as one of the few African-Americans in the field makes him even cooler, and his historical erasure even more shameful.\n\nLawson’s technological breakthrough was the development of the video game cartridge, which he created alongside others at Fairchild Semiconductor. Before, individual games were hardwired into the machine. Think arcade cabinets. Changing games required knowing both mental motherboard programming knowledge as well as physical disassembling and soldering knowledge. That’s for a niche group of DIY nerds; not the wide consumer base games need to thrive. So the cartridge, which allows users to easily hot swap games on a console while withstanding repeated use without electrocutions, is a bigger miracle than you might even realize. Plus, being able to sell individual games outside of the machines needed to play them opened up gaming as a business exponentially.\nDespite Lawson’s invention, the 1976 Fairchild Channel F console and its cartridges didn’t become a huge success. That was the Atari 2600 the next year. Lawson went on to start his own game development company Videosoft and remained an obscure figure in the industry, which seems unbelievable considering what he did. But in 2011 the International Game Developers Association named Lawson, an industry pioneer. He passed away shortly after.\nArticles about Lawson tend to pop up around this time of year. I wonder why? But if you’re curious the best resource is still this extensive interview with Lawson conducted by Benj Edwards of Vintage Computing and Gaming in 2009.\nI just wanted to add my voice to the chorus saying Jerry Lawson is a too-often forgotten titan of the industry who always deserves more recognition. A Jerry Lawson biopic could be the Hidden Figures of video games. But until then the best we can do to honor Lawson’s legacy is continue enjoying his creations. I know who I’ll be thanking whenever I plug a new cartridge into my Nintendo Switch.\nWant to learn more?
