Or at least they're not willing to take to the streets to show it. \nOf the 14,000 people who had signed up for a protest march in Santiago asking Chile's star striker to leave the Gunners, only a handful actually turned up for the event. Despite having 14,000 confirmations on Facebook, only five people turned up to a planned march calling for Alexis Sanchez to quit Arsenal. pic.twitter.com/ldyJte6eIx - Ars√®ne's Son (@hughwizzy) March 2, 2017 \nIn fact, a video put up on the Facebook page set up for the event showed that the march attracted more journalists and photographers than actual protesters. \nThe page was set up after Arsenal's dismal performance in the 5-1 defeat to Bayern Munich last month by fans fed up with Sanchez not getting enough support from his teammates. \nSanchez is the Gunners' leading scorer this season but his future at the club is uncertain has he has yet to sign a contract extension, fuelling speculation that he could leave this summer. \n\"We, as Chileans are tired to watch one of our biggest stars play on his own to make his team get through,\" read the caption on the \"National March for Alexis Sanchez\" Facebook event page. \nThe page quickly attracted thousands of signatures, with more than 14,000 having signed up before Wednesday's actual march. But of those, around 13,995 seem to have found better things to do with their time. \nWe're not sure what Sanchez's thoughts are about his future. But chances are that meagre turnout is unlikely to sway him one way or the other. \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent. Follow him on Twitter: @MattiasKaren.
