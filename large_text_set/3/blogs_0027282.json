By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 25, 2017 12:29 PM Rahul Dravid may have to choose between IPL and BCCI after his new contract. (Source: PTI) \nFormer Indian captain Rahul Dravid who is currently also serving as the coach of India Under-19 and India A sides along with being the mentor of Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League has been put in a tricky situation by the BCCI. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to come up with a new annual contract for its coaches, support staff and physiotherapist. One of the striking points of these contracts will be to avoid conflict of interest as ordered by the Supreme Court-mandated Committee of Administrators (CoA). \nCOA is currently overseeing board’s affairs and has taken a very strong stand on officials holding two positions. The current contract given by BCCI to Rahul Dravid allows him to serve for the Board for only 10 months and in the next two months, he engages in the IPL. Along with Dravid, other senior staff members Sanjay Bangar (batting coach), R Sridhar (fielding coach) and physiotherapist Patrick Farhart also participate in IPl in different roles. \nYou may also want to watch: \nAndrew Leipus, chief physio at the National Cricket Academy was part of the Kolkata Knight Riders backroom; and, Farhart was attached to Mumbai Indians. Rahul Dravid was paid Rs 2.62 crore for his services and the salaries of Sanjay Bangar and Sridhar have been recently hiked from Rs 1 crore to Rs 1.5 crore. According to the Indian Express, Rahul Dravid is okay with the changes in his contract but might do some negotiations. \n“We will pay him what he (Dravid) is getting in the IPL. By having 12 months of his services, we can add responsibilities, maybe at the NCA where zonal camps happen during the IPL. The BCCI doesn’t want another conflict of interest issue raised now, especially when the CoA is overseeing the board’s affairs. The new contract will not only be for Dravid but also for the support staff,” said BCCI sources.
