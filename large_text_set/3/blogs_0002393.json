Recently, there were reports that Bebo has nicknamed her son, little John. \nBut Kareena recently clarified the rumours and denied keeping any such nickname for Taimur. She told HT: \nI want to clarify that. How can anyone think that? Why would I call my son Little John? My son’s name is Taimur. It is the most beautiful name, and he is the most beautiful and gorgeous man. And, no, I don’t call him Little John. Please address him as Taimur Ali Khan. \nThere you have it! No more trolls, we hope! 18", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T13:36:17.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
