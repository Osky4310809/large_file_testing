In the digital economy, applications are critical. Combining real-time visibility and intelligence at the network, security and application layers is transformational for companies. It can provide them with insight into the state of their business and most importantly, into the quality of their customers’ experiences. To drive this transformation, we are excited to announce Cisco’s intent to acquire AppDynamics, Inc., a leading privately held application intelligence software platform! \nAs companies across industries are expanding their digital infrastructure, IT departments are faced with vast amounts of complex, siloed data. AppDynamics helps many of the world’s largest enterprises translate this data into business insights and empowers them to drive value for their customers in today’s digital world. \nTogether with Cisco’s industry leading digital network architecture, customers will now have unprecedented end to end insight across their technology stack, from infrastructure to application. With this insight, companies will be equipped to improve customer experiences and accelerate revenue opportunities. The acquisition of AppDynamics also supports Cisco’s strategic transition toward software-centric solutions that deliver predictable recurring revenue. \nThe AppDynamics acquisition is expected to close in Cisco’s third quarter of fiscal year 2017. AppDynamics will continue to be a led by CEO David Wadhwani as a new software business unit under Rowan Trollope, Cisco senior vice president and general manager, IoT and Applications business. We look forward to welcoming the AppDynamics team to Cisco.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:39:43.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
