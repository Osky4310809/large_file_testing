You probably read the title and are unsure of what we’re talking about. How can music take the shape of anything? It’s sound. Well prepare to be amazed. One musical genius made music into the shape of a unicorn and it sounds epic AF.\nYouTuber Andrew Huang created a “MIDI unicorn,” which is basically a picture created with sound. It’s definitely an abstract concept that’s hard to describe , so we’ll let the professional do the talking .\nThe song Huang created is like something out of an old school fantasy video game, and we’re all about it. \nToo. Freaking. Cool. Huang explained that he drew inspiration (get it?) from fellow composer and music producer, Aleksander Vinter, also known as “Savant.” Savant started this MIDI picture phenomenon a few weeks ago and via his Facebook page we can see his miraculous creations. Each one sounds like a snippet from a film soundtrack.\n\nHere’s Savant’s MIDI picture of a t-rex: & \nT-rex \nPosted by Savant on Thursday, February 9, 2017 And here’s another Savant creation called “bird in the rain” that sounds and looks pretty breathtaking: & Bird in the rain ☔️\nPosted by Savant on Thursday, February 9, 2017 Before Huang mastered his unicorn MIDI picture, he went through a lot of trial and error. Huang made a YouTube video last week explaining to his viewers who Savant is and how Huang wanted to create a Savant-inspired MIDI picture.\nIn this video, we can see Huang’s process to achieve his final product. It’s pretty fascinating and takes a lot of MIDI knowledge and thought. Beginners in the composing field might want to start small before leaping into full unicorn.\nWe’re super glad Huang didn’t give up on this project because the final result is truly amazing. We love music and we love technology! And we love those who know how to use both to create something amazing!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:48:07.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
