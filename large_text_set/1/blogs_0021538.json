She seemed to have little patience for the arguments presented by the government, which focused heavily on the fact that the two defendants named in the suit had already been released. At one point, she visibly lost patience with a government attorney who was participating by phone.\nDonnelly noted that those detained were suffering mostly from the bad fortune of traveling while the ban went into effect. \"Our own government presumably approved their entry to the country,\" she said at one point, noting that, had it been two days prior, those being detained would have been granted admission without question.\nIn the middle of the hearing ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt informed the court that he'd received word of an imminent deportation to Syria, scheduled within the hour. That prompted Donnelly to ask if the government could assure that the person would not suffer irreparable harm. Receiving no such assurance, she granted the stay to the broad group included in the ACLU's request.\nAfter the decision was made, Donnelly asked the government if they could provide a list of those being detained to the ACLU. The government's attorneys indicated that they could not. \"It is more difficult than it sounds,\" U.S attorney Susan Riley said.\nThe ACLU said it had won a stay in federal court preventing implementation of the executive order.\n13 held at O'Hare after Trump order, but Park Ridge man freed Grace Wong and Stacy St. Clair Thirteen people were believed to be in custody Saturday night at O’Hare International Airport as authorities enforced President Donald Trump ’s executive order on immigration from certain majority-Muslim countries – a crackdown that left relatives frantic and prompted protesters to rush to the airport.\n... Thirteen people were believed to be in custody Saturday night at O’Hare International Airport as authorities enforced President Donald Trump ’s executive order on immigration from certain majority-Muslim countries – a crackdown that left relatives frantic and prompted protesters to rush to the airport.\n... (Grace Wong and Stacy St. Clair) As Trump's order targeting citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries reverberated across the world on Saturday, it became increasingly clear that the controversial measure he had promised during his presidential campaign was casting a wider net than even his opponents had feared.\nConfusion and concern among immigrant advocates mounted throughout the day as travelers from the Middle East were detained at U.S. airports or sent home. A middle-of-the-night lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqi men challenged Trump's executive action, which was signed Friday and initially cast as applying to refugees and migrants.\nBut as the day progressed, administration officials confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted U.S. legal residents from the named countries - green-card holders - who happened to be abroad when it was signed. Also subject to being barred entry into the United States are dual nationals, or people born in one of the seven countries who hold passports even from U.S. allies such as the United Kingdom.\nThe virtually unprecedented measures triggered harsh reactions from not only Democrats and others who typically advocate for immigrants but also key sectors of the U.S. business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticized the president. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Canada announced it would accept asylum applications from U.S. green-card holders.\nTrump executive order protest Craig Ruttle / AP Protesters assemble at John F.

As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the president stood squarely behind it.\n\"It's not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\"\nThough several congressional Republicans denounced the order, the vast majority remained silent and a few voiced crucial support - including, most prominently, House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis., who had rejected Trump's anti-Muslim proposals during the campaign. \"This is not a religious test, and it is not a ban on people of any religion,'' Ryan said Saturday. \"This order does not affect the vast majority of Muslims in the world.\"\nThe president's order, signed Friday, suspends admission to the United States of all refugees for 120 days and bars for 90 days the entry of any citizen from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. That list excludes several majority-Muslim nations - notably Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia - where the Trump Organization, now run by the president's sons, is active and which in some cases have also faced troublesome issues with terrorism.\nSyrian families bound for Allentown turned back under Trump order Andrew Wagaman and Laura Olson After months of work, the house on Second Street in Allentown was ready Saturday for Ghassan Assali's two brothers and their families.\nAssali and his wife, Sarmad, remodeled it and furnished it and were prepared to hand over the keys to the Syrian relatives upon their long-awaited arrival Saturday...\nAfter months of work, the house on Second Street in Allentown was ready Saturday for Ghassan Assali's two brothers and their families.\nAssali and his wife, Sarmad, remodeled it and furnished it and were prepared to hand over the keys to the Syrian relatives upon their long-awaited arrival Saturday...\n(Andrew Wagaman and Laura Olson) According to the text of the order, the restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the United States without a visa because of terrorism concerns. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering powerful and wealthy majority-Muslim allies, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\nAmid widespread confusion on Saturday about how the order will be enforced, some administration officials acknowledged that its rollout had been chaotic. Officials tried to reassure travelers and their families, pointing out that green-card holders in the United States will not be affected and noting that the Department of Homeland Security is allowed to grant waivers to those individuals and others deemed to not pose a security threat. It can take years for someone to become a green-card holder, or lawful permanent resident authorized to permanently live and work in the country.\n\"If you've been living in the United States for 15 years and you own a business and your family is here, will you be granted a waiver? I'm assuming yes, but we are working that out,'' said one official, who could not be more specific because details remained so cloudy. A senior White House official later said that waivers will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that green-card holders in the United States will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country.\nBut officials made clear that the federal officers detaining refugees and migrants with valid U.S. visas and restricting them from entering the country were following orders handed down by top DHS officials, at the White House's behest.\nThe order drew cries of outrage from a range of activist and advocates for Muslims, Arabs and immigrants. More than 4,000 academics from universities nationwide signed a statement of opposition and voiced concern the ban would become permanent. They described it as discriminatory and \"inhumane, ineffective and un-American.\"\nThe executive action has caused \"complete chaos\" and torn apart families, said Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n Trials and Arbitration Donald Trump Paul Ryan", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d3241/turbine/mc-syrian-family-allentown-stopped-philadelphia-airport-trump-immigration-ban-20170128", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d52d0/turbine/ct-several-reportedly-detained-at-o-hare-international-airport-20170128", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d544e/turbine/ct-trump-travel-ban-emergency-stay-20170128", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d5450/turbine/ct-trump-travel-ban-emergency-stay-20170128-001"], "published": "2017-01-29T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T05:00:59.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
