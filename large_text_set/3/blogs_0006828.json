The track that currently gets the most rewinds Beatrice Dillon: Halfway \nJay: This is one of my favourite records to switch the room up with. The production on this is just so incredible; those intricate echoes of voices which filter through the track alongside the ranging sounds of percussion. The track I’d play to show off my eclectic tastes OOIOO: I’m A Song \nMoonbow: I’m an absolute sucker for hyperactive psych jams. This manages to pick up elements of jazz and Terry Riley-esque repetition while simultaneously taking off at 160 bpm. This track was one of my first introductions to the Osaka noise scene. The track that got me out of bed this morning Laurie Spiegel: East River Dawn \nJay: There is nothing quite like some space-age synthesis to nudge me out of my dream and into the real world. I adore long tracks; this 14-minute song taken from Spiegel’s masterpiece The Expanding Universe weaves between carefully placed arpeggios rich with cosmically deep melodies. The track I wish I’d signed to my label Elysia Crampton ft Rabit: The Demon City \nCharlotte: This is so evocative it’s almost like watching a film – the chord sequences that slow to allow you to survey the city, and then pick up pace again with the beat to continue the tour, spattered with bubbles of demonic laughter. It ends with a Hollywood voiceover; this version of hell comes to us via the big screen and Grand Theft Auto. The track I’d play at sunset in Ibiza Misstress Barbara: Talk To Me \nSybil: This is the most Ibiza record I own, proper 2001 hands-in-the-air tech-trance from Misstress Barbara. Having found no place to play it other than at silly house parties, I would be honoured to play it in its spiritual home. \nSIREN play Night + Day, O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Mon Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T14:38:30.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
