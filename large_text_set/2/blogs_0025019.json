Under Trump, NASA announced the discovery of the seven planets, around the star TRAPPIST-1. Some Twitter users joked that this showed the new administration’s competence. Under Obama, we lost planets (RIP Pluto). \nIn Trump’s first month, we’ve found SEVEN https://t.co/ue38vCiimx \n— Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) February 22, 2017 \nThree of these new TRAPPIST-1 worlds could be potentially habitable based on their size and location to Earth around the star. Scientists used the Spitzer Space Telescope to locate the seven Earth-sized planet, which is just 40 lights years away. \nThe star in question is much cooler than our sun, but three of the planets are likely in its “Goldilocks Zone,” making them potentially habitable. \nScientists were even able to estimate the size and density of the planets. The researchers are currently using the Hubble Space Telescope to determine if these planets had atmosphere. One of the potentially inhabitable planets, dubbed TRAPPIST-1E, is very similar in size to Earth and likely has very similar temperatures. Another called TRAPPIST-1F is potentially covered in water. \nNASA announced in May that its Kepler Space Telescope found 1,284 new exoplanets, or planets, outside our solar system. Roughly 550 of those exoplanets could be rocky planets, like Earth, based on their size. Nine of these exoplanets orbit in their stars’ “Goldilocks Zones.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:05:44.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
