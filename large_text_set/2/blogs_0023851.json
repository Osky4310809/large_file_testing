The teams they face in the next two weeks entered with a combined record of 284-278. The Warriors have won nine straight against the Clippers. And after the finish their “insane” stretch, they get three straight at home against the Sixers, Magic and Bucks (combined 67-103).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:10:39.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
