I think Trump’s kind of a joke. But, suck it up,” added Matt Smith of Glassboro, New Jersey. \nPresident-Elect Trump Meets With MLK III On Day Honoring His Father \nThe list of house members skipping out on Friday’s swearing-in grew longer over the weekend, when President Elect Donald Trump traded jabs with Representative John Lewis of Georgia, calling the civil rights leader “all talk and no action,” on twitter, in reponse to Lewis’ claim his election was illegitimate. \n“He picked a fight with an icon, somebody most respected on both sides of the aisle,” said Congressman Bob Brady,   first district. \nBrady says he changed his decision, out of respect for Lewis. And while he doesn’t question our political process, he does have doubts about the Trump administration. \n“I worked with Bush, Corbett, Ridge…decent people. Don’t know what’s happening.

I respect it. But, I will not celebrate it.” \nIt was a different decision for Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey. In a statement, a spokesperson confirmed his attendance, but went on to say: \n“Senator Casey has deep respect for Representative Lewis, someone whose actions over many years have moved our nation forward.
