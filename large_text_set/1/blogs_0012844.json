And, oh yeah, a $70,000 raise. \nThis, at a time when there’s no money for raises for the county’s rank-and-file workers. \nWho didn’t see this one coming? \nMaricopa County’s new treasurer, Royce Flora, is a star in the right-wing circles and a big FOP (Friend of Pearce). He’s a self-described “constitutional conservative” who served as chief deputy to then-Treasurer Charles “Hos” Hoskins and was allowed by Hoskins to i nsert what essentially was a campaign flier into county property tax bills last year as part of his bid for the top job last year. \nIn October, Russell Pearce, an employee of the office, sent around an e-mail urging Republican precinct committeemen to vote for Flora. No surprise there. With Flora’s help, Pearce landed an $85,000-a-year job in the Treasurer’s Office in 2014, after being ousted from the Senate by voters and losing an election to try to regain his seat. \nAnd if Flora’s opponent had been elected, Pearce would have been out of a job. Democrat Joe Downs vowed to fire Pearce on his first day in office. \nInstead of being out of job, Pearce is now in the money, scoring a five-figure raise that’ll provide a nice boost to his state pension. His third state pension, that is. \nHe already collects $53,937.12 a year from the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System from his 21 years at the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. \nWhich isn't to be confused with his $10,446.72 pension from the Elected Officials' Retirement Plan for his time as a justice of the peace and legislator. \nNow he can look forward to his future pension from the Arizona State Retirement System – for his work at the county Treasurer's Office and previously, his work heading the Governor's Office of Highway Safety and the state Motor Vehicle Division, where he was fired in 1999 for his role in altering a woman's driving record so she could avoid a suspension for DUI. \nAnd a sweet pension it will be, thanks to his new $157,000 salary. \nA gooey triple dip of taxpayer-supplied goodness for the guy who spent his political career calling for cuts to government waste and bureaucracy.
