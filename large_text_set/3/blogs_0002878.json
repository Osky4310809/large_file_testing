A guy steals from the rich and gives to the poor, becoming an idol to the disenfranchised and an existential threat to those in power. You can tell that story in different settings, time periods or cultures, but it still usually pans out the same way. So how do you make Robin Hood seem fresh in this day and age? Kill him, of course. \nThat seems to be the setup for Marian , a script from Pete Barry that reportedly sparked a lot of buzz in Hollywood before landing with Sony and Margot Robbie in the leading role. As you can guess from the title, it's about Maid Marian, but this isn't just a gender-swapped version of the story. In it, Robin Hood is murdered in the middle of their cause, leaving Marian left to pick up the pieces of his rebellion. \nIt should be a pretty juicy role for Robbie, too, considering Deadline is describing the project as \" Braveheart meets Game of Throne s.\" But it should also be a few years away at this early stage. There is no director attached, and Robbie has a few high-profile projects already in the works (most notably Gotham City Sirens ), but once the stars align this should be an interesting project.
