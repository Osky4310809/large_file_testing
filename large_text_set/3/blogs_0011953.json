This would value the building at $2.85 billion, a record even in New York City.\nRelated: Oh, Just FYI… YOU Are Now Paying Trump's Hefty Legal Bills… \nThe investment is said to be \"unusually favorable\" according to real estate experts, leading many to wonder if this is a way of buying influence with Ivanka Trump 's husband — who is of course, also the President's senior adviser.\nCampaign Legal Center general counsel Larry Noble explains: \n\"At the very least, this raises serious questions about the appearance of a conflict that arises from the possibility that the Kushners are getting a sweetheart deal. A classic way you influence people is by financially helping their family.\"\nA Kushner Cos. spokesman says this poses no conflict of interest as Jared has already sold his ownership stake.\nBut isn't financially benefitting your family kinda the same as financially benefitting you? This really seems like the Kushners are splitting heirs there.\nRelated: Ivanka Has The Best-Selling Perfumes On Amazon Right Now! \nAs far as Anbang's agenda?\nWhile little is known of its ties to the Chinese government, we do know this: after Anbang purchased Manhattan's Waldorf Astoria Hotel (also for a record price) in 2014, the U.S. government began an investigation into the mysterious company.\nAfterward, President Barack Obama would no longer stay at the famous hotel due to fears of espionage .\nSo that's who Jared Kushner's family is in bed with now.
