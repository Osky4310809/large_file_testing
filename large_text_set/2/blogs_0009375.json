The South American striker looks set to match that number if pushed into the TOTW 22 team, seeking improvements on an already glittering array of stats, including 94 shooting and 91 dribbling. Sadio Mane, Liverpool Mane ran the show for Liverpool in a 2-0 win over Tottenham on Saturday. Mike Hewitt/Getty Images It was clear Liverpool missed the services of star forward Mane during his time away with Senegal at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, and the attacker illustrated his importance to the Reds with a brace against Spurs on Saturday. FIFA YouTuber and Liverpool supporter Bateson87 was especially pleased to see the returned star leading Liverpool's line again: Bateson87 @bateson87 2/11/2017, 7:22:22 PM Tottenham boast one of the fiercest defences in the Premier League, and despite other attackers performing well this weekend, Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright hailed Mane's performance in particular, per the Liverpool Echo 's Kristian Walsh : \nHe’s the top man. One (win) in seven games when he wasn’t playing, and that was against Plymouth. They couldn’t win a game without him. \nThe four of them have only played twice in three months together, but when they’re playing together, Mane is the one with the extra bit of pace threatening in behind. Lallana as well. \nHe intercepts, he’s away, threatening behind. They weren’t doing that recently. With the goal, Ben Davies had no chance trying to mark him what with his strength, pace and composure. He’s excellent at sensing danger and nicking the ball. Mane has already received one Team of the Week boost this season, and owners of his Ones to Watch card will be licking their lips at the prospect of seeing him improved to at least an 85 after his 84-rated Team of the Tournament card for the AFCON. The right-winger will be a terrifying prospect if his already fearsome 96 pace is increased again, while any boosts on his 88 dribbling, 81 shooting and 80 passing will make Mane even more of a Premier League weapon. Kylian Mbappe, AS Monaco Mbappe scored his first Ligue 1 hat-trick against Metz. VALERY HACHE/Getty Images Looking to France, Mbappe could be jostling with Paris Saint-Germain powerhouse Edinson Cavani for a place in the TOTW 22 field after he put three past Metz with what was his maiden Ligue 1 hat-trick on Saturday. Despite being just 18, Mbappe has already earned comparisons to ex-France striker Thierry Henry, although BT Sport pundit Julien Laurens said the Monaco prodigy is better than the former Gunner was at this age: BT Sport Football @btsportfootball", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:32:14.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
