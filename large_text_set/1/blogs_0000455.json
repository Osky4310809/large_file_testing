Lead generation should be a top priority for all businesses because at the end of the day, you want to convert your website visitors into subscribers and customers. In this article, we will show you how to do lead generation in WordPress like a pro. \n\nSince this is a lengthy article we decided to add a table of contents for easy navigation. \nWhat is lead generation? Getting Started with Lead Generation in WordPress Lead Generation in WordPress Using Comments Lead Generation Using Contact Form in WordPress Lead Generation Using Popups and Dynamic Optin Forms Creating and Using Lead Magnets in WordPress Optimizing Your Lead Generation Campaigns What is Lead Generation? Lead generation is a method to generate consumer interest or inquiry into products or services of a business. \nStudies prove that more than 75% of users visiting your website from search engines will never see it again. \nLead generation allows you to capture those users by opening a communication channel between your site and the user. \nThis communication channel could be asking them to like your page on Facebook, follow you on Twitter, or join your email list. \nEmail is the most commonly captured lead. Simply because it is undeniably the most cost effective and efficient marketing tool at your disposal. \nSee our article on why building your email list is so important today .\n\nOnce you get a user to perform an action that opens a communication channel, you can send them special offers, updates, or even freebies to bring them back. \nWho Should Start Generating Leads? \nWhether you are a blogger, small or large business, or a hobbyist, you need to do lead generation. Basically if you care about growing your audience base, then you should start generating leads. \nMany successful online marketers and bloggers will tell you that the biggest mistake they made was not starting an email list to capture leads earlier.\nWhen Should I start Lead Generation? \nLead generation takes time and every moment you are not doing it you are losing potential customers. \nYou should start your lead generation efforts right away. Even if you are just starting out and not even open for business yet. \nHaving said that, let’s take a look at how to get started with lead generation in WordPress. \nGetting Started with Lead Generation in WordPress First, you will need a self-hosted WordPress.org website. If you don’t already have a WordPress site, then take a look at our step by step guide on how to start a WordPress blog . \nAfter that you need to sign up with an email marketing service provider. These companies specialize in sending mass emails with an easy to use interface. We recommend using Constant Contact or AWeber . \nYou will also need OptinMonster , the best lead generation software available in the market. This is the lead generation plugin that we use here on WPBeginner.\nAside from that, we will be covering several other WordPress lead generation plugins along the way to help you convert website visitors into customers.\nLead Generation in WordPress Using Comments Comments are the easiest way to build user engagement. However, default WordPress comment system is not very efficient in bringing back the users who leave comments. \nLet’s take a look at how you can capture leads from comment forms on your WordPress site. \nCapture Leads by Adding Comment Redirect \nBy default, when a user submits comment on your website they get to see the same page again. There is nothing new on that page except for the preview of their own comment. \nYou can convert these visitors into subscribers by redirecting them to a different page on your WordPress site after they submit a comment. This could be a thank you page, special offer page, etc.\nHere is how to redirect users after comment submission in WordPress. \nFirst, you need to install and activate the Yoast Comment Hacks plugin. For more details, see our step by step guide on how to install a WordPress plugin .\nUpon activation, you need to visit Settings » Comment Hacks page and click on ‘Comment Redirect’ tab. \n\nSelect the page where you want to send first time commenters and then click on the save changes button. \nNow all first time commenters on your WordPress site will be redirected to your selected page. You can optimize this page by adding an email signup form, offer a special discount, or anything else you want. \nAdd Comment Subscription Option in WordPress \nAs we mentioned earlier, WordPress does not send any notifications to users after they leave a comment. The user will have to manually come back to your site to see if someone replied to their comment. \nAdding comment subscription option will allow users to get notified about new comments. It will also increase your pageviews, return visitors, and brand recognition. Most importantly, this will give you more opportunities to convert those visitors into subscribers. \nHere is how you can easily add comment subscription option to your WordPress site. \nFirst, you need to install and activate the Subscribe to Comments Reloaded plugin. For more details, see our step by step guide on how to install a WordPress plugin .\nUpon activation, you need to visit Settings » Subscribe to Comments to configure the plugin settings.\n\nThe default settings should work for most websites. However, you can review the options and make changes if necessary. \nDon’t forget to click on the save changes button to store your settings. For more detailed instructions see our guide on how to allow users to subscribe to comments in WordPress .\nLead Generation Using Contact Form in WordPress Contact forms are the most common way to generate leads in WordPress. However, most contact form plugins for WordPress are either too difficult to use or do not integrate with your email service provider. \nThis is where WPForms comes in. It is the most beginner friendly contact form plugin for WordPress. You can easily create beautiful contact forms and seamlessly integrates with email service providers like MailChimp , Aweber , Campaign Monitor, and GetResponse . \nCreate Lead Generation Forms in WordPress \nWPForms Lite is a free WordPress contact form plugin that you can use to create any type of lead generation form in WordPress.\nWhether you want a simple contact form, request a quote form, or another inquiry form, you can easily create it with the drag & drop form builder.\n\nFor more details, follow our step by step guide on how to create a contact form in WordPress .\nRedirect Users After Form Submission \nAnother technique that you can use to boost sales is adding a redirect page upon a successful form submission.\nWPForms allows you to easily redirect users to any page after they have submitted a form using the smart form confirmation feature.\nOnce you have created your form with the drag & drop form builder , click on the settings tab and then click on confirmation. \n\nWPForms allows you to choose three type of confirmations. You can simply show a message, redirect users to a WordPress page, or to any other URL. \nYou can create a separate page on your WordPress site with special offers, optin form, or show them any content that will help you convert the visitor into a customer. \nAfter you’re done with the settings, make sure to save and exit the form builder. \nAdd Newsletter Signup Option to Your Forms \nWhile contact forms are great for collecting inbound leads, you can also use it to build your email newsletter.\nSince the user is already entering their email address in the form, you can automatically sign them up for your newsletter with their consent.\nWPForms Pro plugin comes with marketing integrations that allows you to connect your lead generation forms with all popular email marketing services.\nFor the sake of this article, we will be using the MailChimp integration to automatically add users to our MailChimp email list once they submit a contact form.\nOnce you have installed WPForms Pro, you need to visit WPForms » Addons page. Here you will find addons for different email service providers. \nGo ahead and click on the Install Addon button next to MailChimp Addon. \n\nWPForms will install the MailChimp Addon. You will need to click on the Activate button to start using the addon. \nThe next step is to connect WPForms to your MailChimp account. Visit WPForms » Settings page and then click on ‘Integrations’ tab. \nYou will see MailChimp listed as an integration. Clicking on it will allow you to enter your MailChimp API key and a Nickname for this account. \n\nYou can get your API key from your account on MailChimp website. \nClick on connect to MailChimp button to continue. WPForms will now connect to your MailChimp account. \nYou are now ready to add email optin fields to your contact form. \nHeadover to WPForms » Add New page. This will launch WPForms form builder interface. \nFirst you need to provide a title for your contact form and then select ‘Simple Contact Form’ from the list of available templates. \n\nWPForms will now create a simple contact form for you. You can edit the fields by clicking on them. You can also add new fields by clicking on them in the left column. \n\nNow, you need to click on the ‘Checkboxes’ field to add a newsletter signup checkbox. Clicking on the field will show you its settings. \n\nYour form is almost ready. Now you just need to connect the form fields to your email list. \nClick on ‘Marketing’ tab and then click on MailChimp. Create a new connection and provide it a name. \n\nWPForms will now load your MailChimp email list and the form fields you just created. Map the name and email address fields to the appropriate fields in your contact form. \nNext, you need to check the box next to ‘Enable conditional logic’ option. This allows you to ONLY add users who opt-in to join your email list. This is very important. While you can easily add all users to your email list, the ones who opt-in are a better quality lead.\nGo ahead and select the newsletter optin field you added as checkbox. \n\nDon’t forget to save your form and exit the form builder. \nContact forms are the most common way to boost lead generation in WordPress, but you can take it even further with personalized optin forms.\nLead Generation Using Popups and Dynamic Optin Forms Adding a plain looking email subscription box to your sidebar is not the only way to capture leads. In most cases, users don’t even notice those forms because they blend in.\nThis is where OptinMonster comes in. It allows you to create and A/B test high-converting optin forms for your WordPress site without hiring a developer. We use it on WPBeginner and have increased our conversions by over 600%.\nOptinMonster allows you personalize your optins based on user behavior, so you can show them the most targeted offer at the best time.\nFor example, you can show customized optin forms for:\nDifferent sections, pages, or blog categories Based on User’s Physical Location (City or Country) Based on User’s Previous Interactions with Your Website Based on Where the Visitor is Coming from (Google, Facebook, etc) Based on Their Device (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop) Based on Their Activity such as time on page, time on site, scroll-depth, mouse movements, etc. And more… Combined with these targeting options, dynamic optin forms are the most powerful tool in any marketer’s toolbox.\nExit-Intent Lightbox Popup for Email Signups \nOptinMonster is a pioneer in exit-intent technology . This allows you to detect user’s mouse movement and show them a popup at the precise moment they’re about to leave.\nThis is particularly helpful in giving users one last chance before they leave your website. It is also less annoying because the popup doesn’t appear until a user decides to leave the page. \n\nExit Popups are proven to work that’s why all industry leaders are using it. \nSocial Media Examiner added over 250,000 new email subscribers using exit popups from OptinMonster.\nMichael Hyatt doubled his subscription rate with exit popups. Search Engine Journal increased their conversions by 240% ( source ).\nAside from email signups, you can also use lightbox popups to grow your Facebook page or even increase your Twitter following.\n\nBoost Conversions with Fullscreen Welcome Gates \nFullscreen optins also known as Welcome-Gate or Interstitial popups, allow you to display a fullscreen overlay on your content. \nYou can combine it with OptinMonster’s exit-intent or content-lock features to make certain pages on your website a lead-magnet. \n\nFullscreen is one of the most sought after advertising spot because it converts extremely well. That’s why sites like Forbes, Inc and others use it.\nInstead of showing other people’s ad, you can use it for lead generation purposes on your website.\nCapturing Leads Using Floating Bars \nFloating bars are a particularly effective dynamic optin form that works really well. It adds a sticky floating bar at top or bottom of your website. \nThe bar remains visible as the users scroll down your website. It does not stops users from viewing your content, and users can easily close or hide it. \n\nSlide-in or Scroll Triggered Optins to Grab User Attention \nSlide-in or scroll boxes appear on your page when a user scrolls down. The animation grabs user attention and makes the optin more noticeable than a traditional optin. \nBelow is an example of how iThemes is using it on their website:\n\nCreating and Using Lead Magnets in WordPress \nLead Magnets are special offers used as an incentive for performing an action. \nThis special offer could be an exclusive download, an ebook, a helpful resource, discount coupon, etc. \n\nLead magnets work extremely well because they offer users something valuable in return, they are quick and easy, and users don’t have to pay for them. \nNeed ideas?
