It seemed that Blomkamp’s film would happen for a while alongside Ridley Scott’s return to the franchise. Blomkamp’s film was set to follow Prometheus 2 , but then that film changed to Alien: Covenant . This should’ve raised a few alarms.\nThe film has always stood on shakey ground , even with Sigourney Weaver throwing in her support . Now Blomkamp himself is casting doubt on the film ever seeing the light of day. A fan’s question on Twitter let the Chappie director offer a one word answer on the film’s status: \n\n@jamesportella slim\n— Иeill Blomkamp (@NeillBlomkamp) January 21, 2017 \n\nThis shouldn’t be surprising for fans. There’s no reason for another film with Covenant going all in including Xenomorphs. The good news is now Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection might still survive to remain part of the series canon. This isn’t the most pleasing thing for fans, but some happen to enjoy the silliness of Resurrection . \nNone of this means the end for the project, though. Blomkamp isn’t going anywhere . And the franchise is sure to carry on in some form after Ridley Scott finishes his films. By that point, we could be ready for a return to the action-packed version introduced by James Cameron. Definitely a better choice than another Alien Vs. Predator film.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T12:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T07:50:22.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
