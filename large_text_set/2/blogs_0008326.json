In NSW, police and health authorities, bracing for three days of 40-plus temperatures, have triggered their “Heatwave Action Plan”. \nOn top of hospital admissions over heatwave-related conditions, there is a high chance of bushfires and potential power cuts. A heatwave cut electricity to 44,000 households in South Australia on Wednesday, prompting questions over Australia’s energy security as we enter into what is likely to be our hottest summer ever. \nI will be blogging today from the air-conditioned comfort of Guardian Australia’s office in Sydney, where the mercury had already hit 30.6C just after 10am. Tell me if it’s hot enough for you in the comments or on Twitter .
