TCU put an end to that in the Big 12 tournament.\nThe TCU Horned Frogs are heading to the semifinals of the Big 12 tournament after upsetting the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks , 85-82, on Thursday afternoon. \nDesmond Bane hit the game-winning free throws with 2.5 seconds left after he was fouled by Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk on a three-point attempt. He calmly made all three from the stripe and sealed one of the biggest wins in program history. \nTCU will now face off against Iowa State at 6 p.m. Friday on ESPN. The win moves the Horned Frogs to 19-14 on the season.\nKansas raced out to an early lead to start the game, but the Horned Frogs stormed back to take a 43-42 lead into the break. TCU took control early in the second half, forcing the Jayhawks to play catch up until the later stages of the game. \nKenrich Williams led the way for the Frogs with 18 points, 8 rebounds and adding 5 assists. He was all over the floor, scoring, creating assists and forcing turnovers at the other end to put his team in front. \nThe Jayhawks fought their way back in the game late, and with just over three minutes to play managed to take the lead for the first time in the second half since their opening minutes. \nFrank Mason III led the Jayhawks, scoring 29 on 7-15 shooting, including 3 shots from beyond the arc. He also added 6 assists. Mykhailiuk added 18 and Landen Lucas added 13 points and 14 rebounds.\nAlex Robinson and Vladimir Brodziansky were the Horned Frogs’ top scorers behind Williams , adding 13 and 11 points respectively. \nKansas was without star freshman Josh Jackson after he was suspended for a “traffic incident” . Jackson is the team’s second-leading scorer and will be available in the NCAA Tournament .\nHere’s what the Big 12 bracket looks like right now:\nThursday, March 9 (quarterfinals) \nGame 3: No. 4 Iowa State 92, vs. No. 5 Oklahoma State 83\nGame 4: No. 8 TCU 85, No. 1 Kansas 82\nGame 5: No. 2 West Virginia vs. No 10 Texas, 7 p.m., ESPNU\nGame 6: No. 3 Baylor vs No. 6 Kansas State, 9 p.m., ESPNU\nFriday, March 10 (semifinals) \nGame 7: No. 4 Iowa State vs. No. 8 TCU, 7 p.m., ESPN2\nGame 8: Game 5 winner vs. Game 6 winner, 9 p.m., ESPN2\nSaturday, March 11 (championship) \nGame 9: Game 7 winner vs. Game 8 winner, 6 p.m., ESPN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:34:42.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
