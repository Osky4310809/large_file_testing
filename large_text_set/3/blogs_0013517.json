He has 50.5 sacks and 7 forced fumbles during his eight-year career. The #Rams agreed to terms with pass-rusher Connor Barwin, giving him a 1-year deal worth a max of $6.5M, source said. \n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 16, 2017 \nAccording to Ian Rapoport, he has signed a one-year deal that can be worth up to $6.5 million. \nHere’s what team reporter Myles Simmons said about the news ( via TheRams.com ): \n“Since his injury in 2010, Barwin has not missed a game, making 96 consecutive starts for the Texans and Eagles. Barwin signed with Philadelphia in 2013, putting up a career high 14.5 sacks in 2014 for the club.” \nWhile he played defensive end for the Philadephia Eagles last season, he will likely play outside linebacker for the Rams in 2017. \nHe has previously played extraordinarily well under Rams defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Barwin played under DC Wade Phillips in Houston from 2011-2012. In that first year, Barwin had 11.5 sacks. \n— Myles Simmons (@MylesASimmons) March 16, 2017 Related: Connor Barwin , Los Angeles Rams , Rams , rams free agency , rams news , rams updates , wade phillips , Rams Free Agency Bryan Kalbrosky University of Oregon alum who has published with FOX Sports, Bleacher Report, LA Weekly, Huffington Post and various other publications.
