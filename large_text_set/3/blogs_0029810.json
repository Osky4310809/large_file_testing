But something wasn’t adding up for Colbert. \n“Not enough votes to get a majority?” he mused. “Well, that didn’t stop him from becoming president.” \nTrump insists his failure to repeal Obamacare was not a broken promise because, according to the president, he never pledged during the campaign to repeal Obamacare in 64 days. Colbert found about 10 instances when Trump, on the campaign trail, said that he would immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. \n“After all his campaign promises. Nothing. It’s almost like you can’t trust a fast-talking city slicker who rolls into town promising a magic solution for all of our medical needs,” Colbert said. “I’m starting to doubt the effectiveness of Dr. Bannon’s anti-Muslim toad oil.” \nDespite the derailment of the GOP’s health care bill, a conservative pac ran ads during March Madness that prematurely celebrated the successful repeal of Obamacare. \n“Republicans are keeping their promise with a new plan for better health care. Thank Congressman Greg Walden for keeping his promise and replacing the Affordable Care Act,” the narrator of the ad said, which was paid for by American Action Network. \nColbert joked that they might as well have run ads “congratulating Kansas for making it to the Final Four and printed a newspaper declaring, ‘Dewey Defeats Health Care Reform.'” Taylor Link is a news writer at Salon.
