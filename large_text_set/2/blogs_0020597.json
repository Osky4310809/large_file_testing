There are contanious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film was refused under guidelines.(sic)” \nYou may also like to watch this video \nA member of CBFC, Ashok Pandit also questioned the move, said, “I am myself quite shocked to see these kind of words have been used in the letter.
