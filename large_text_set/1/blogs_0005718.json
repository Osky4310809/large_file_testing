What! The! Hell!\nIt’s fine that you need to find a chill way to tell your kids that you and Dad have to go see a man about a snake in the master bedroom en-suite, I guess? As previously stated, I’m not a parent and I certainly have no idea what it’s like to have a child and then have said child ask me why I’m in the bedroom with the door closed at 2 p.m on a Tuesday and where the hell is Dad anyway.\nDo children need to know if their parents are about to get it on while their children are awake and tugging at their pant legs to watch Peppa the Pig for the seven hundredth time? Is the white-hot passion that flows between Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban a force so strong that it cannot be tamed or ignored? Do you think that maybe they found themselves in this situation so many times that they had to come up with a name for it?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:27:29.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
