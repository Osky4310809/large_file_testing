For this, Polaroid introduces a new camera, Pop, that shoots and prints three-inch by four-inch photos, instantly. The device also acts as a digital camera, allowing the user to shoot in either digital or print formats, or even both simultaneously. \nPop boasts a 20-megapixel CMOS sensor, dual-LED flash, 3.94-inch touchscreen LCD, and can record 1080p video, all while writing to microSD cards up to 128GB. In addition, you can take advantage of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to transfer images. \nAs for now, we do not know how much the Polaroid Pop will cost, but expect a release to take place towards the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:46:18.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
