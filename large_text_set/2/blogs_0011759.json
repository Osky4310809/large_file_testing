Yesterday, Acosta complained that the \"fix was in\" and President Trump only called on sympathetic outlets. Acosta opened by saying: \"I don't hate you.\" \"Your ratings arenât as good as some of the other people that are waiting,\" he said. \"Theyâre pretty good right now, actually, Mr. President,\" Acosta responded. Acosta and Trump debated the role leaks played in the campaign and in the first month of his administration. Trump said 'Fox & Friends' on Fox News Channel were \"very honorable\" and \"honest\" but the \"tone of hatred\" on CNN is \"unwatchable.\" \"You look at your show that goes on at 10 in the evening. The panel is almost always exclusively anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings... But the hatred and venom coming from his mouth,\" Trump said about CNN. \"I watch it, I see it, I am amazed by it.\" \"They'll take this news conference, I'm actually having a very good time, but they'll take this news conference... That's how I won. I won with news conferences and speeches. I certainly didn't win with you people, that's for sure. But I am having a good time. Tomorrow you will say: Donald Trump rants and raves... But I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time. But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump rants and raves,\" he explained. When Acosta points out that Trump is \"attacking our network,\" Trump responds: \"I'm changing it. From fake news though. Very fake news.\" Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:17:22.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
