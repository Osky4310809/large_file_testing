You know that hair leftover on the shower wall after you lather, rinse, and repeat? It can apparently be used to make masterpieces. Meet Lucy Gafford, a Mobile, Ala.-based artist who uses the leftover hair on her bathroom wall to design everything from Yoda to Donald Trump. Gafford has created 400 shower works in the past few years, with most of them taking about an hour and a half. “I started fooling around with [the leftover hair,] posted some pictures online, it was supposed to be like a joke. I think my first one was a squirrel,” she says. Since then, she’s moved on to works like champagne bottles, Princess Leia, and Valentine’s Day-themed pieces. You name it, this woman can make it out of hair left on the shower wall. Do you feel inspired to do something with that knot of hair in the drain yet? But shower art isn’t her only medium. Gafford dabbles in art across the board. She describes herself as an all-around artist. “I do painting, murals, I make pet head sculptures out of clay, I do costumes mostly out of scrap materials,” she said. The lesson here: Creativity can be found anywhere, even on the shower wall.
