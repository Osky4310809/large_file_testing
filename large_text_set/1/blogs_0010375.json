We have already seen a couple of renders and alleged live images of the phone ahead of the unveiling. Now the Samsung Display subsidiary may have leaked a prototype of the Galaxy S8. In addition, an alleged live image of the flagship has also hit the interwebs. \nSamsung Display released two videos over the weekend showing off the brand’s latest AMOLED screen technology. The videos show what looks like a purported prototype of the Galaxy S8. The device in the videos features slim top and bottom bezels and the absence of the physical home button. The brand is expected to embed the fingerprint sensor of the phone beneath the screen itself. The prototype of the phone in these videos appears to sport a flat screen panel, while the earlier reports have pointed towards a dual-curved display. \nAs far as the live image of the Galaxy S8 is concerned, it shows a similar looking design that’s seen in the official videos, but it carries a larger display that’s curved towards both sides, indicating that this could be the rumoured S8 Plus variant. The Samsung logo can be seen at the bottom bezel. The live image is also missing a physical home button. The rumour-mill suggests that the Galaxy S8 will be unveiled at an event on April 18th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T09:11:23.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
