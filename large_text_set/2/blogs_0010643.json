Judges Canby and Friedland earlier denied the Justice Department’s request for an immediate stay of the TRO, but set a more full briefing schedule that led to Tuesday’s arguments.\nAugust Flentje, from the Justice Department, argued for the federal government, and the state of Washington’s solicitor general, Noah Purcell, argued for the states.\nOver the past two days, the states of Washington and Minnesota — who are suing the federal government over the order — and the Justice Department, as well as several outside groups, filed briefs with the court over the statutory and constitutional questions at issue in the challenge to Trump’s order.\nNow, the court will hold an hour of argument time — 30 minutes for each side — over the question. In a media advisory about the hearing, the court announced that a decision “is not expected to come down today,” but that a ruling would “probably” come “this week.”\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provided an audio livestream of the arguments, which will be before a three-judge panel — providing the chance for people listen in real time to the arguments over the authority of the president, and the courts, on questions relating to immigration and national security issues.\nThe appeals court generally provides a video livestream of arguments, but the quick turnaround of scheduling for Tuesday’s arguments mean that the hearing will actually being taking place over the phone. Friedland, who will be presiding over the arguments, is in San Jose, California; Canby is in Phoenix; and Clifton is in Honolulu.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:40:22.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
