ADVERTISEMENT \nThe volume of cargo that has been put on hold was not immediately known as of Tuesday . Polloc Port is a major transshipment point as there has been a sharp increase in the entry of cargo at the port in the past few years. The port had registered a cargo volume of 757,948 metric tons during the past few years because of the increased international trade by regional businessmen. \nIn illustrating how serious the problem was, Mastura said Polloc Port in Parang town has been serving as the region’s main gateway for international trade in the region. \n“While we mourn the tragic loss of life and empathize with those abducted, we are deeply concerned that the bane of piracy in the Sulu Sea has affected our international trade leading to revenue losses for the ARMM regional government, which owns and operates Polloc Port,” Mastura said. \nThe most recent attack by pirates in the area involved the Vietnamese-flagged bulk carrier Giang Hai, which was carrying 4,500 tons of cement from Indonesia. The pirates killed one crew member and abducted seven others, Mastura said. The military said all seven captives were Vietnamese and identified six of them as Buy Xuan Vien (captain); Do Huu Nghia (chiefmate); Bui Trung Duc (third mate); Nguyen Huu Trong (second engineer); Tran Viet Van (sailor); and Nguyen Quang Huy (oiler). \nMastura, quoting a report by Hexan Mabang, the Polloc Port manager, said the latest act of piracy “was what prompted several shipments of cement and other cargo to be suspended as shippers refused to charter vessels passing through the Sulu Sea headed for Polloc Port and other Ports in Mindanao.” \nMastura said businessman Christopher Lu also told him that he had been expecting a cargo shipment of wood chips and sundry bulk cargo from Malaysia and Indonesia but the shipper later refused to proceed after learning of the latest attack.
