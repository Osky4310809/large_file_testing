Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp got a huge boost ahead of the Merseyside derby on Saturday as Daniel Sturridge returned to training. \nThe England striker has had a wretched time with injuries and has not featured for Klopp's team since a 2-0 defeat at Hull in early February. \nHe last started a game nine weeks ago, for a League Cup exit at the hands of Southampton but was finally out on the training pitch again on Thursday afternoon. \nSturridge was initially sent home from the team's mid-season break in La Manga with a virus, before contracting a more serious complaint back on Merseyside.
