But don’t lose faith, here are some styles from some K-dramas that will keep us warm and stylish. 1. My Love From the Star \nThis outfit features a long coat and long boots! It’s perfect for covering up in the winter but also allows you to play around with what goes under that long coat whether it be a mini skirt, jeans, a sweater, or even a crop top; you’ll be warm whether you’re grabbing a drink with friends or squeezing in that last minute gift shopping at the mall.

Final touches can be made with jewelry of some sort to give it a special embellishment. \nWatch “Heirs”: 3. Cheese in the Trap \nFor those who don’t have to deal with the snow and have relatively warm winters, the outfits seen in “Cheese in the Trap” keep it simple. Check out the drama for fashion influences whether it’s for strolling around campus or cramming for finals in a coffee shop. \nWatch “Cheese in the Trap”: 4. Healer \nThe outfits in “Healer” aren’t flashy and are actual quite casual, but they do wonders with one key item. Turtlenecks are great for so many reasons in that they keep you warm and accentuate your jaw line. \nWatch “Healer”: 5.
