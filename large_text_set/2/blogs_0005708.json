Hopefully he can continue like this.\" \nOne player whose performance was not up to scratch was Saul Niguez, with the midfielder withdrawn at half-time and Simeone publicly singled him out. \n\"I thought he was not having a good game,\" Simeone said. \"That 1-0 wasn't enough and I thought that with Correa between lines we could do more damage. It [the change] came off perfectly, which I welcome.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:53:44.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
