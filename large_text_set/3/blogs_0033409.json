Examples of others growing in price but also size: 16-ounce Shell’s, Summit and Bauhaus rising $2 to $9.50.\nFrom northeast Minneapolis comes the Herbivorous Butcher’s popular vegan specialties, a meat-free Sriracha brat and vegan Italian sausage (both $12.50). They can be found paired with the MSP Kosher Hot Dog cart at section 129.\nMinnesota’s own global gastronomic giant Andrew Zimmern is growing his Canteen-Skewers venue and introducing new Mediterranean-style skewer flatbread sandwiches at section 114. Patrons choose their favorite meat, and each sandwich is served with roasted eggplant spread, herbed yogurt sauce, and tomato and cucumber.
