They used their bedding, piled them on top of each other to escape.\" \nHe added that he believed the attack was to free a number of rebels who were in the jail. \nPhilippine military and police have launched a manhunt for the escaped inmates. \nThe MILF is in the midst of a long-running peace process with the Philippine government, but it has been hampered by the fact that the group has splintered into several factions and offshoot groups, some of which have refused to surrender.
