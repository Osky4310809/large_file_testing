So when \"Donald Grump\" appears in a 2005 episode as a badly toupeed muppet \"whose name equals trash,\" that's not necessarily an insult.\nThe other thing is that Trump, as president of the United States, wants to end public television funding that created \"Sesame Street\" - more often known for lessons on counting and sharing than biting satire.\nThere are only three known episodes in which the character \"Grump\" appears, each time playing the villain in a moral allegory.\nWhenever Grump visits Sesame Street, chaos is not far behind.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nWe know of nothing to suggest any link between these skits and Trump's budget proposal. He is not the first president to desire the elimination of public broadcasting funds. And because the show now airs on HBO, Trump's plan is unlikely to destroy Sesame Street, as Grump tried so hard to do.\n1. Grump cons a muppet into signing a draconian contract\nLike Trump, Grump's ambitions started out big and got huge. He first appears in an episode in the late 1980s - a grouch in a tacky fedora, knocking on Oscar's iconic trash can to offer a deal.\n\"Grump's the name. Ronald Grump,\" he says. \"I'm a builder.\"\nThat was Trump's fame too, then. The original Trump Tower in New York had opened a few years earlier.\nGrump shows Oscar a color rendering of six trash cans stacked on top of each other.\n\"Grump Tower,\" he says, giving the \"u\" a faux-European pronunciation. \"It's a duplex can-dominium.\"\nOscar is intrigued. His friend Maria is horrified.\n\"We don't want that monstrosity on this spot!\"\nBut Grump entices Oscar to sign a contract - essentially bribing him with a free room in the tower and three bags of trash.\nIn the next scene, the dented trash can that generations of children had grown up watching is gone. A shabby stack of Grump cans stands in place of Oscar's old home.\n\"Isn't it tony?\" Oscar brags from the top of the tower.\nBut then Grump notices the grouch's worm and elephant friends living below.\n\"Get 'em out!\" he snaps. No pets in the contract.\nTrump, too, had his tenant issues. In the 1970s, the New York Times notes, the Justice Department sued him and his father for allegedly refusing to rent to black people. The developers settled with the government, admitting no guilt.\nA few years later, as the Atlantic recounted, renters accused Trump of cutting off their heat and water and using other intimidation tactics to kick them out of a building. Trump sued them for $150 million.\nBack on Sesame Street, Oscar was in a bind. He either had to put Slimy and Fluffy out on the street, go homeless, or pay Grump 40 bags of trash to get his old can back, which would leave him in poverty.\nAppeals to Grump's conscience did no good. Oscar was only saved when his friends cobbled together their own trash bags to pay off Grump and get rid of his tower.\n\"Goodbye Mr. Grump,\" Oscar says, laughing.\nBut Grump would be back.\n2. Sesame Street gets politically woke\nVideo: Grump Tower comes to Sesame Street Watch Sesame Street residents react to the building of Grump Tower.\nWatch Sesame Street residents react to the building of Grump Tower.\nSee more videos \"Real estate tycoon Ronald Grump has announced plans to demolish Sesame Street and create a lavish new Grump Tower,\" a dire Barbara Walters announced in 1994, at the beginning of the show's 25th anniversary special.\nIt had been years since Grump last showed his face on the block. Now he was played by Joe Pesci, trying to pitch a crowd on his plan to build a combination tower, restaurant and theme park. Historic Sesame Street would be turned into a luxury boutique in the lobby.\n\"Trust me, you won't miss all this,\" Grump says - then flies into a rage at the first sign of dissent.\n\"I tried to be nice to you people! You got two weeks. Pack up and leave.\"\nThe muppets are despondent. \"If we don't do something about Mr. Grump, Elmo think we will be history,\" Elmo says.\nOver the course of the special, Grump physically intimidates Benny Rabbit and sort of hits on a reporter played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\nThe muppets try to win him over. With clip montages. (This is an anniversary show from the mid-90s, after all.) But the memory of a little girl kissing Kermit the Frog after being taught to count leaves the Grump \"deeply and profoundly disgusted.\"\n\"If there's one thing I despise, it's cheap sentiment,\" he says.\nFinally, Big Bird recalls Sesame Street's greatness and leads all the residents in a march down Sesame Street to stop Grump. They find him once again trying to con Oscar into moving out of his trash can. Grump Tower's would-be tenants refuse to mingle with grouches.\nIn a deus-ex-machina twist that baffled at least one critic, Oscar reveals that his can is government property, and so Trump can't force him out.\n\"This neighborhood does not deserve a Grump Tower anyway,\" Grumps says. Then he joins all the muppets in a celebratory song to end the episode, because that's just how children's TV sometimes works.\nBy the way: If you have any nostalgia for vintage \"Sesame Street,\"do not watch Pesci's outtakes from the anniversary special.\nSeriously, don't.\n3. Grump pits the muppets against each other. And someone sort of gets deported.\nVideo: Grouch Apprentice with Donald Grump Watch Donald Grump spoof \"Celebrity Apprentice\" on \"Sesame Street.\"\nWatch Donald Grump spoof \"Celebrity Apprentice\" on \"Sesame Street.\"\nSee more videos More than 10 years went by after the special. In the real world, Trump made his first flirtations with politics and began honing his public image as the severe host of \"Celebrity Apprentice.\"\nIn 2005, his likeness returned to Sesame Street as \"Donald Grump\": a grouch again, but now in an orange wig - and famous among muppets for his reality show and spectacular wealth.\nWith a great rumble, Grump popped out of a can atop a table strewn with Grump-branded trash.\nThe muppets chanted: \"Grump! Grump! Grump!\"\n\"I'm the trashiest, I'm the grouchiest Grump,\" he sang.\nAnd then, as he always did, Grump sowed division on Sesame Street.\nHe enlisted the muppets into a contest to become his helper, making them compete with each other to perform menial tasks, like sorting his old sneakers.\nWhen a pair of grouches' performance displeased him, Grump told them to leave Sesame Street.\n\"Don't forget your suitcases,\" he said.\nThe contest narrowed to a matchup between Elmo, Oscar and his girlfriend, Grundgetta. But the latter two spent all their time arguing with each other about the prize.\nElmo worked the hardest and won all the events. In a fit of cruelty, Grump cut him anyway.\nHe chose as his apprentices the two other grouches. Because, he explained, they were caustic and ineffective at their jobs.\n\"I've got a reputation to think of,\" Grump said.\n\"Sesame Street's\" parent company has not yet responded to questions about Grump's origins, and whether he might return during the Trump administration.\nRELATED STORIES:\nA Muppet with autism to be welcomed soon on 'Sesame Street'\n'Let's abolish culture': What cutting NEA, other agencies would do to the arts in Chicago\nThese are the 19 agencies Trump would stop funding entirely\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\nCopyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Donald Trump Barbara Walters U.S. Department of Justice", "external_links": ["http://d3ik2vfsvyg6fu.cloudfront.net/a/embed.html#layout=", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58c3194f/turbine/ct-greg-kot-album-reviews-pictures-pg", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58d037e9/turbine/ct-donald-grump-apprentice-video-20170320", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58c9b74e/turbine/chi-movie-reviews-pictures-pg", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/trending/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58d03ba4/turbine/ct-sesame-street-donald-grump-20170320", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58d0390c/turbine/ct-sesame-street-grump-tower-video-20170320"], "published": "2017-03-20T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:15:01.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
