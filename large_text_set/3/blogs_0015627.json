But alas, disco is dead, and not everybody knows that particular song. So New York Presbyterian Hospital offered a playlist of popular songs in that same 100 BPM range that will also work for timing CPR. \nThe playlist includes 40 songs from different genres, so there's something for everybody. \nHere are the rock tunes in the order in which they appear on the playlist: \n1. Simon & Garfunkel \"Cecilia\" \n2. The Black Crowes \"Hard to Handle\" \n3. Lynyrd Skynyrd \"Sweet Home Alabama\" \n4. Queen \"Another One Bites The Dust\" \n5. Phil Collins \"You Can't Hurry Love\" \n6. Pink Floyd \"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\" \n7. Norman Greenbaum \"Spirit In The Sky\" \n8. The Doors \"Five To One\" \n9. Modest Mouse \"Float On\" \n10. Barenaked Ladies \"One Week\" \nPerforming CPR more than doubles the survival rate of patients who go into cardiac arrest. \nPhoto: Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:06:57.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
