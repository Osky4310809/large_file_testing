(Photo: American Airlines) \nAmerican Airlines is bringing free food back to the economy cabin on two of its high-profile of cross-country routes. The change mirrors a similar move announced last month by rival Delta Air Lines. \nBeginning May 1, American will add complimentary meals for all customers on “select coast-to-coast flights” operated with its Airbus A321T aircraft. American’s A321Ts are configured for long transcontinental flights and include lie-flat seats in first- and business-class. \nThe “select” routes will be American’s non-stop flights connecting New York JFK to the California cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. \n“Some of our best customers fly our trans-continental routes and we want to give them a top-notch onboard experience,” Fernand Fernandez, American’s VP – Global Marketing, says in a statement . “Providing complimentary meals in the Main Cabin is yet another step we’re taking to enhance our service in this competitive market.” Posted!
