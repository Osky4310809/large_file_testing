Jan. 11, showing off the first trailer for CHIPS \nBut the rowdy, R-rated action-comedy (opening Friday) hasn't gone down nearly as smoothly with the stars of the original TV series CHiPs, which ran from 1977 to 1983 with Larry Wilcox (Jon Baker) and Erik Estrada (Frank \"Ponch\" Poncherello) . \nWilcox directed a tweet to the film's studio: \"Way to go Warner Bros. — just ruined the brand of CHIPS and of the Calif. Highway Patrol. Great choice!\" — larry wilcox (@LarryDWilcox) January 12, 2017 \nMichael Peña, left, and Dax Shepard rock the tight tan uniforms in 'CHIPS.' (Photo: Peter Iovino) \nWilcox, 69, does not appear in CHIPS and has not seen the film. But he has remained critical toward the gun-toting, sex-obsessed new version, noting scenes from the CHIPS trailer such as when new Ponch (Peña) carries a naked Baker (Shepard, who also is the film's writer and director) to the shower, trips and face-plants into his partner's crotch. \n\"I’m very candid. I wasn’t enamored with two guys rubbing genitals in their faces and talking about CHIPS ,\" Wilcox tells USA TODAY, calling it \"low-brow humor. Dumb and Dumber on motorcycles.\" \nWilcox says the comedy could succeed in theaters. \n\"Even if you are Dumb and Dumber, it should be a major success by just riding on the coattails of the previous branding bonanza,\" says Wilcox. \"I wish them luck.\" \nWilcox says he was not invited to Monday's Hollywood premiere, but says he will rent CHIPS eventually. \n\"I have to see it out of curiosity,\" he says. \"That would be myopic of me not to look and enjoy another interpretation of a '70s TV show.\" \nMichael Peña, left, and Dax Shepard ride the roads of California in the new 'CHIPS.' (Photo: Peter Iovino) \nIn the January trailer aftermath, Estrada, 68, retweeted a fan comment that said, \"I saw the trailer the other day...PURE TRASH...remember (not 100% sure) real CHiPs NEVER drew their gun.\" Estrada chalked the resulting furor up to a social media miscue. (The tweet has since been deleted). \n\"The part I reacted to was that on CHiPs, we never drew our guns. That’s what I was retweeting,\" says Estrada. \"But I blew over the other part because I didn’t pay attention. And later, I was just like holy (cow).\" \nEstrada, who saw CHIPS at Monday's premiere, has since been vocally supportive of the film which features his cameo. \nErik Estrada with co-star Larry Wilcox in 1977 photo from \"ChiPs.\" (Photo: GPN) \n\"I’m getting a lot of reaction from CHiPs fans that the movie is insulting. They are not insulting anybody. They are just doing their own version of it. Not everyone makes the same chicken cacciatore,\" says Estrada. \"I’m good with it. I’ve got no ax to grind. And if people don’t like it, they don’t gotta see it. If they want the CHiPs they grew up with, go every day at 4 p.m. and watch it on MeTV.\" \nShepard makes clear that he was seeking his own motorcycle-action-filled, bawdy version. \"I would hope that Erik would love the movie. And I would hope Larry would love the movie. If they don’t, I cannot really control that. I had to make the movie that I wanted to see,\" says Shepard. \nEstrada calls this CHIPS \"a nice cigar at the end of a long, long motorcycle ride.\" As for TV's CHiPs fans, his advice: \"You get yourself a Coca-Cola, and a bag of popcorn and go have a few laughs. And watch some fantastic stunt work,\" says Estrada. 4 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:25:43.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
