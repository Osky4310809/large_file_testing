This will be the 14th FA Cup campaign in our history, 11 of which got started at home and against lower league opposition. The two exceptions were in 2012-13 and 2013-14, while in 2003-04, we need a replay at Stamford Bridge to get past Watford. So that sort of counts, too.

The defending FA Cup champions, as we normally do in the FA Cup, took things rather seriously, with Zola (twice), Hasselbaink, Gudjohnsen, and Poyet all scoring in the 5-0 triumph. \nStarting at center back in that game was none other than a 20-year-old John Terry, making his 23rd appearance for the club. On Sunday, the 36-year-old is set to make his 711th. Chelsea are likely to not use nearly as much of a first-choice lineup as in that game in 2001, but nothing less than a dominant win will be expected once again. \nDate / Time: Sunday, January 8, 2017, 15:00 GMT; 10am EST; 8:30pm IST \nVenue: Stamford Bridge, SW6 \nReferee: Kevin Friend — we last saw Mr. Friend almost exactly a year ago, in the 3-0 win away over Crystal Palace. Friend also officiated our FA Cup third round 3-0 win over Watford two years ago as well as the 5-0 win over Watford, again, in 2010. \nForecast: Low clouds (plus a bit of pollution for good measure) \nOn TV: none (UK); Fox Sports 2 (USA); none (India); SuperSport 5 (Africa, various); beIN Sports Arabia 5 (where available); elsewhere \nStreaming online: Fox Soccer 2Go (USA); Chelsea TV (radio, int'l); BBC Radio 5 Live Extra (radio, UK) \nChelsea team news: Home matches in the FA Cup against lower league opposition are about as much of a formality as it gets for Chelsea. We've only ever lost just one such game in 35 tries , the 4-2 reverse to Bradford City two years ago. That game also closely followed a two-goal loss at White Hart Lane. Dun-dun-DUN. (Surely, that glitch in the Matrix won't repeat again...) \nThere are no injury or suspension concerns of note, with Conte already confirming a start for John Terry and hinting at one for Michy Batshuayi as well. Youngsters Kenedy and Charly Musonda will not feature however to keep them eligible for possible loan moves later this month. Speaking of loan moves, Nathan Aké should be heading back to Chelsea shortly, but not in time to feature in this one. \nPeterborough team news: The Posh, as they're known, sit 9th in League One (i.e. third division) having lost just once in their last 13 games in all competitions. That includes a replay win over Notts County in the previous round of the cup, with Peterborough's young and exciting attackers showing plenty of potential for causing havoc in a slower, older backline. \nFormer Spurs youngster Shaq Coulthirst, in-form Gwion Edwards, and Chelsea fan Leo Da Silva Lopes are just a few of the names to watch out for from over 50 positions below Chelsea in the league pyramid. Similarly moulded new signing 21-year-old Junior Morias will miss out through ineligibility however — he was part of a Wycombe side that lost to a Chelsea reserves side 5-0 in a preseason match in 2014 . He was released soon after and had spent the previous 2.5 years in non-league football before signing with Peterborough last week. \nAs the usual cliche goes, the visitors from the lower league have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Giant-killings are a rare sight at Stamford Bridge, but that doesn't mean they're impossible. \nPreviously: Time for some grainy footage of that 5-0 in 2001.
