Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nBuzzfeed editor Ben Smith was the guest of CNN’s Brian Stelter on Sunday. Stelter and Smith had a lengthy exchange about their reporting on the unverified dossier stating that Russia has compromising information that can be used against President-elect Donald Trump. CNN's @brianstelter and @BuzzFeedBen clash over Buzzfeed's decision to publish unconfirmed Trump memo https://t.co/snZbXEEQDC \nSmith said he was “proud” that his organization published all of the details. This is essentially an argument/debate of \"who's less bad\" https://t.co/S0h7kUjjz2 \n— Cristian Nyari (@Cnyari) January 15, 2017 \nYep.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T00:15:29.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
