Watch and vote for the best Sky Bet EFL Goals of the Month for January in the Championship, League One and League Two. \nThe three leagues have kicked off 2017 with a bang, producing some stunning strikes as we hurtle towards the end of the season with fights for promotion, play-offs and relegation in full swing. \nBut which goal was the best? Watch the videos of the three nominated strikes from each league and vote for your favourite. Voting closes at 6pm on Tuesday February 14. Championship Nominees for the Sky Bet Championship Goal of the Month award for January 2017, including strikes from Tom Lawrence, Souleymane Doukara and Ben Osborn \nTom Lawrence (Preston 1-1 IPSWICH - January 28) \nThere was an audible gasp when Lawrence picked the ball up on the left, jinked between two defenders and lifted his curling shot into the far corner. \nSouleymane Doukara (LEEDS 2-0 Nott'm Forest - January 25) \nA headed clearance dropped to Doukara. With impeccable technique and exquisite timing, he struck a volley so sweetly into the top corner, it almost broke the net. \nBen Osborn (NOTT'M FOREST 1-0 Bristol City - January 21) \nMatthew Cash tapped back a free-kick, Osborn flicked it up with his left foot, then used it again to unleash a dipping 25-yard dipping volley over the wall. League One Nominees for the Sky Bet League One Goal of the Month award for January 2017, including strikes from Chuks Aneke, Josh Morris and Gregg Wylde \nChuks Aneke (Peterborough 0-4 MK DONS - January 28) \nCollecting the ball outside the box, Aneke played a one-two with Paul Downing, strode on to the return pass and walloped a rasping drive into the top corner. \nJosh Morris (Northampton 1-2 SCUNTHORPE - January 14) \nOn a Scunthorpe counter-attack, Morris knew exactly what to do. He picked up the ball in space, slipped it on to his left foot and curled home an unstoppable shot. \nGregg Wylde (MK Dons 5-3 NORTHAMPTON - January 21) \nA case of adjusting your body to a dropping ball. A Northampton free-kick was cleared to Wylde, who chested it down beautifully before timing a sweet half-volley. League Two Nominees for the Sky Bet League Two Goal of the Month award for January 2017, including strikes from Shay McCartan, Gavin Massey and Dan Butler \nShay McCartan (ACCRINGTON 1-1 Carlisle - January 21) \nSome free-kicks are just unstoppable. The only time McCartan's stunning 30-yarder was on target was in the final moments of its flight when it dipped wickedly under the bar. \nGavin Massey (Portsmouth 2-1 LEYTON ORIENT - January 14) \nA game of head tennis ended when Nigel Atangana laid the ball off on the edge of the box for Massey to whip a majestic curling shot into the far corner. \nDan Butler (NEWPORT 3-1 Hartlepool - January 28) \nBouncing balls on muddy pitches are difficult to judge, but Butler did it perfectly, steadying himself to loop his shot effortlessly over a forest of bodies. \nThe shortlist for the poll is decided by a judging panel following suggestions from supporters via Twitter. \nThe judging panel comprises Sky Sports' EFL expert Don Goodman, Sky Bet sponsorship manager David Tweed and EFL head of marketing communications Andy Dodd. \nTo suggest a goal to be considered for future Sky Bet Goal of the Month awards, fans can tweet details of their nominated goal to @SkyBet using #SkyBetGotM.
