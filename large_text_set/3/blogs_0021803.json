This has lead to calls for a second vote on the terms of leaving the EU. SNP accuses Tories of being too 'scared' to allow referendum \nThough the law is highly unlikely to pass some MPs say the bill is an important symbol that the Government has no mandate for a hard Brexit. \nMr Farron is expected to say: “We believe in giving the people the final say on the deal. We have not given up the fight. It is not about blocking Brexit, we simply want to hold Theresa May to account for the decisions she has made, including to take Britain out of the single market and the customs union. \n“Nobody voted for a hard Brexit. And now people face us to the reality of what Theresa May is about to unleash on us, everyone from Tony Blair to Michael Heseltine has come on board to defend what we are saying. \n“A liberal, pro-European movement is building in Britain, and it is building around the Liberal Democrats. Read more Every country surveyed would now vote Remain in an EU referendum \n“The jeering and jingoism will no doubt be loud today in the Commons when I aim to give the people the final say on the Brexit deal. I would expect nothing less of Conservatives and, often, Labour MPs. \n“But this is not about ‘blocking Brexit’, it’s about holding Theresa May to account – such as for wanting to take Britain out of the world’s largest market and Customs Union, even if there is no new trading arrangement in place. \n“To question that is not disloyal: the disloyalty to the British people would be if I were bullied into silence, as Labour have been, and fail to warn how a hard Brexit will hit living standards and future generations.” \nLabour’s leadership has not said whether will back the proposal. Liberal Democrats party leader Tim Farron is proposing the 10-minute-rule bill ( Getty ) \nOn Friday MPs will also vote on a private members bill by Labour MP Geraint Davies, the Terms of Withdrawal from EU (Referendum) Bill 2016-17. \nThis bill would require the Prime Minister to hold a referendum on her specific Brexit proposals before triggering Article 50, which she is expected to do within days. What experts have said about Brexit What experts have said about Brexit 1/11 Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond \nThe Chancellor claims London can still be a world financial hub despite Brexit “One of Britain’s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all of the services the global financial services industry needs” “This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world’s leading international financial centre.” Reuters 2/11 Yanis Varoufakis \nGreece's former finance minister compared the UK relations with the EU bloc with a well-known song by the Eagles: “You can check out any time you like, as the Hotel California song says, but you can't really leave. The proof is Theresa May has not even dared to trigger Article 50. It's like Harrison Ford going into Indiana Jones' castle and the path behind him fragmenting. You can get in, but getting out is not at all clear” Getty Images 3/11 Michael O’Leary \nRyanair boss says UK will be ‘screwed’ by EU in Brexit trade deals: “I have no faith in the politicians in London going on about how ‘the world will want to trade with us’. The world will want to screw you – that's what happens in trade talks,” he said. “They have no interest in giving the UK a deal on trade” Getty 4/11 Tim Martin \nJD Wetherspoon's chairman has said claims that the UK would see serious economic consequences from a Brexit vote were \"lurid\" and wrong: “We were told it would be Armageddon from the OECD, from the IMF, David Cameron, the chancellor and President Obama who were predicting locusts in the fields and tidal waves in the North Sea\" PA 5/11 Mark Carney \nGovernor of Bank of England is 'serene' about Bank of England's Brexit stance: “I am absolutely serene about the … judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC” Reuters 6/11 Christine Lagarde \nIMF chief urges quick Brexit to reduce economic uncertainty: “We want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making” Getty Images 7/11 Inga Beale \nLloyd’s chief executive says Brexit is a major issue: \"Clearly the UK's referendum on its EU membership is a major issue for us to deal with and we are now focusing our attention on having in place the plans that will ensure Lloyd's continues trading across Europe” EPA 8/11 Colm Kelleher \nPresident of US bank Morgan Stanley says City of London ‘will suffer’ as result of the EU referendum: “I do believe, and I said prior to the referendum, that the City of London will suffer as result of Brexit. The issue is how much” 9/11 Richard Branson \nVirgin founder believes we've lost a THIRD of our value because of Brexit and cancelled a deal worth 3,000 jobs: We're not any worse than anybody else, but I suspect we've lost a third of our value which is dreadful for people in the workplace.' He continued: \"We were about to do a very big deal, we cancelled that deal, that would have involved 3,000 jobs, and that’s happening all over the country\" Getty Images 10/11 Barack Obama \nUS President believes Britain was wrong to vote to leave the EU: \"It is absolutely true that I believed pre-Brexit vote and continue to believe post-Brexit vote that the world benefited enormously from the United Kingdom's participation in the EU. We are fully supportive of a process that is as little disruptive as possible so that people around the world can continue to benefit from economic growth\" Getty Images 11/11 Kristin Forbes \nAmerican economist and an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England argues that the economy had been “less stormy than many expected” following the shock referendum result: “For now…the economy is experiencing some chop, but no tsunami. The adverse winds could quickly pick up – and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction” Getty \nThat bill is also incredibly unlikely so succeed, not least because it will almost certainly run out of Parliamentary time before it can be passed. \nThe PM has indicated that she will trigger Article 50 on 29 March.
