Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nBritish NBA basketball star Luol Deng has revealed his ambition is to one day buy Premier League team Crystal Palace. \nThe LA Lakers small forward has been speaking ahead of the Association's return to the UK with the Denver Nuggets taking on the Indiana Pacers at the O2 Arena, London on January 12. \nDeng reveals his love for Arsenal, though he admits he has a soft spot for Palace and harbours hope of one day owning the club. \n“We [Arsenal] just played Crystal Palace where [Olivier] Giroud scored that amazing scorpion-kick goal, but this is where it’s tough,\" Deng admitted. \"Because I grew up three minutes from the Crystal Palace stadium and when I was young on match day there was a hill where we could watch the Palace through a gap in the stadium.

He’s so unselfish, but to a point where it shows how good he is. For Arsenal I think Ozil’s my guy, but I love Sanchez!” \nThe Denver Nuggets host the Indiana Pacers at The O2 in London on Jan. 12 as part of NBA Global Games London 2017.
