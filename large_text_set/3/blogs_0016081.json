Ines Hegedus-Garcia/Flickr\nWhen it comes to savings on household goods, groceries, and more, Costco has always been a winning solution in terms of slashing costs.\nShopping at warehouse clubs is often cheaper than shopping elsewhere, and Sam's Club, Costco, and the like provide exceptional membership benefits .\nBut what if you don't have a membership?\nThere are still ways to land discounts at Costco without paying the annual fee.\nView As: One Page Slides Shop with a member Tim Boyle/Getty Images Perhaps the easiest way to shop fee-free is to visit Costco with a member. The member has to pay for your items at checkout, but the cashier will ring up two separate orders. Just have cash or a check ready for the member upon leaving the store.\nUse a Costco cash card Costco shopping carts shown in California Mike Blake/Reuters Another option is to buy Costco cash card denominations up to $1,000 while at Costco with a member. Only the member can load the cards, but then you can use them to enter the store and buy items without an escort. This is especially helpful for big-ticket purchases such as a TV , so you don't have to pay a membership fee for just one item.\nUse a business account REUTERS/John Gress JG/GN If your employer has a Costco business membership , lobby to be one of the two people whose name is on the account. While you'll get stuck with a few office supply runs, you may also be able to use the card for your own personal savings.\nBuy alcohol Elaine Thompson/AP Images In about a dozen states, alcohol sales cannot be prohibited through a club or membership. Check the laws in your state and, if it's allowed, explain to the door attendant that you are buying non-member goods. This can be a handy way to slash the cost of alcohol for parties or other events.\nTake advantage of health services David Bruce Jr./Flickr Costco makes non-member allowances for health services such as optical exams and hearing screening. However, if you need to buy glasses, contacts, or hearing aids, a membership is required. Find a member willing to purchase and be reimbursed for these items or use a loaded Costco Cash Card.\nUse the pharmacy Pharmacy department drop-off station is seen at the Safeway store in Wheaton Maryland Gary Cameron/Reuters A Consumer Reports survey of generic drug prices found Costco to be the cheapest among more than 200 pharmacies, and prescription medications can be filled at the Costco pharmacy without a membership. Non-members can also get immunizations such as the flu vaccine .\nShop online Matt Cardy / Stringer / Getty Images Non-members can shop on Costco's website to take advantage of the warehouse club's bargain prices on certain items. Gift cards, for example, can be purchased at a discount online without a membership. Currently, it's possible to score $100 in Cold Stone Creamery gift cards for $70 . The disadvantage is that non-members may be hit with a 5 percent surcharge on some orders.\nUse Instacart Flickr / Kristin Sloan The grocery delivery service Instacart will shop Costco on your behalf -- even if you don't have a membership. Consider this nice little loophole as a way to get Costco-priced groceries.\nEnjoy the food cart Yelp/ Costco Food Court A Costco membership is required to get in the door and into the food court at many Costco locations. Yet in warmer climates where the food court is outside the store, food can be purchased without a membership. Costco is known for serving pizza, hot dogs, and other treats for less than $5.\nRead the original article on Cheapism . Copyright 2017.
