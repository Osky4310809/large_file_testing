With its latest D-Series, a 65-inch 4K (Ultra HD) model costs $900, while the 55-inch Ultra HD model is just $570. To be sure, these are not fancy HDR-equipped OLED or quantum dot models, but they do have full-array LED backlighting, built-in WiFi and Vizio's own smart TV system with built-in apps like Netflix.\nTVs this cheap will push more 4K TVs into the mainstream, which will in turn nudge holdout content providers into offering it. While Vizio's D-Series offers middling panel tech and no Dolby Vision HDR, Google TV or other perks, current owners of basic HD sets will see a big difference in quality. Budget-conscious buyers will also get support for Ultra HD game consoles like Sony's PlayStation Pro , Ultra HD Blu-ray players and 4K cable or set-top boxes from the likes of Google Fiber and Roku .\nVizio, which was recently bought by troubled LeEco , pushed out some interesting higher-end 4K options last month too, including a 75-inch 4K E-series model with basic HDR for just $2,000. If you really want 4K Dolby Vision HDR without spending too much, you'll need to go for Vizio's P-series, with 55-inch sets at $1,000, or switch to TCL, which offers a 50-inch 4K Dolby Vision TV for just $500. For the sake of comparison, Sony's 55-inch 4K OLED TV costs $5,000, showing the wide gulf between the low- and high-end.\nVizio's 4K sets are now available at Walmart, Target, Best Buy and other retailers. 4K models run $420 for a 43-inch set, $500 for the 50-inch model, $570 for the 55-inch version and $900 for the top-end 65-inch model.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:21:41.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
