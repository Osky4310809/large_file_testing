Image caption The government of Queensland had the removal of the controversial law as an election promise \nAfter successfully using section 304 of the Criminal Code [killing on provocation] the two men charged with his murder received lesser jail terms. \nOne of his attackers was released after just four years of a nine-year manslaughter sentence. \nQueensland Attorney-General and Minister for Justice Yvette D'Ath said: \"The passing of this legislation sends an important message that discrimination is not acceptable and that we value the LBGTI community.\" \nWayne Ruks's mother, Joyce Kujala, said she had waited eight years for the change. \n\"It can't bring Wayne back but it's some small justice and it could save a lot of lives in future,\" she said.
