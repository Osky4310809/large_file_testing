Color lover and avid runner. Obsess over dogs, beer, and anything from the 80's Who are you? \nHi there! My name is Phalen Reed and I am a graphic designer hailing from Iowa, but now calling beautiful Minneapolis home. I am a full-time freelancer specializing in branding, packaging and print. Most of my experience comes from the beverage industry, but I have recently been breaking into the retail and grocery categories. I am also the Lead Graphic Designer at Rowan Made , a local brand and web design studio. \nOutside of design, you can find me running around the lakes of Minnesota with my husband, trying out the latest brewery (bring on the hops) and compulsively watching 80’s movies with our two shiba inus. What are you working on? \nA fun mixture of branding and packaging projects, mostly for creatives. I’m wrapping up a brand redesign for a literacy center in downtown Minneapolis, a logo redesign for a wedding videographer on the East Coast and new retail steak packaging.
