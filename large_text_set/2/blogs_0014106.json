Now, Samsung has added its Samsung Calculator app to the list. \nThe goal of adding apps to the Play Store is to make it easier for Samsung to update these apps without them weighing down the size of updates for firmware. Since these apps will now be updated via Google’s app store, Samsung can focus on certain integral parts of its software without worrying about basic apps that only delay updates rather than encourage them. For example, Samsung just made its Samsung Notes app Nougat-compatible in the Play Store two months ago, an app that Samsung can maintain at the Play Store while perfecting other parts of Nougat’s software. \nAt this point, the Samsung Calculator app can only be downloaded on Android 7.0 Nougat (which just started rolling out for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge a few weeks ago) or higher, so those who have yet to see the update are out of luck. If you have the Android Nougat update, go ahead and hit up the Play Store. Then come back and let us know if you had smooth sailing or encountered any problems. \nAre you glad to see Samsung releasing more apps to the Play Store?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:05:36.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
