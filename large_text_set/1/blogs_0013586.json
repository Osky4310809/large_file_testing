The new top-end MacBook Pro with 15-inch display offers up to 16GB of RAM. Now it appears that the company will be expanding the RAM capacity on this year’s MacBook Pro and MacBook laptops. \nIn a note to investors obtained by AppleInsider , notable KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests that Apple’s 2017 MacBook lineup will focus on internal component updates. The brand is expected to launch a 15-inch MacBook Pro model with up to 32GB of RAM. Production for this model is pegged start in the fourth quarter this year. Kuo also predicts that the new notebooks will also be upgraded to Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs. \nKuo expects that Apple will also upgrade the 12-inch MacBook’s RAM to include a 16GB option. It will offer the same lightweight design as its predecessor, and will enter mass production in the Q2 this year. The 13-inch and base 15-inch MacBook Pro’s will enter mass production in Q3 this year, Kuo further added. He also believes that Apple will offer deep discounts to boost shipments of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. Kuo had previously stated that the new MacBook models will be unveiled in the second half of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T12:27:47.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
