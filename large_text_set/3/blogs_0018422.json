They called it a “pathetic asterisk of condescension,” because they’re not playing around with the demand for the “mutual” in that respect referenced in their title.\nNow the group has responded to Tim Allen and his disgusting “joke” (does it have to be funny to be a joke?) that for conservatives in entertainment, Hollywood is “like ’30s Germany.” Because working in a primarily liberal industry is comparable to mass genocide? There’s only one way to respond to that: with all-caps anger. So that’s what the Anne Frank Center went with.\nACTOR TIM ALLEN HAS MADE A DEEPLY OFFENSIVE CHARACTERIZATION THAT TRIVIALIZES THE HORRORS IMPOSED ON JEWS IN NAZI GERMANY. WE CALL ON TIM TO APOLOGIZE.\nThey continued by quoting the center’s Executive Director, Steven Goldstein, who asked the question I imagine every one of us would like to ask Allen: “Tim, have you lost your mind?”\nI think that’s a valid question. Goldstein continues,\n“No one in Hollywood today is subjecting you or anyone else to what the Nazis imposed on Jews in the 1930s—the world’s most evil program of dehumanization, imprisonment and mass brutality, implemented by an entire national government, as the prelude for the genocide of nearly an entire people. Sorry, Tim, that’s just not the same as getting turned down for a movie role. It’s time for you to leave your bubble to apologize to the Jewish people and, to be sure, the other peoples also targeted by the Nazis.”\n\nI can’t imagine Tim Allen is actually going to issue an apology, but that’s to be expected. He’s a busy man, what with fighting that oppressive system that’s kept him in starring roles for the last two decades.\n \n(via THR , image via screengrab)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
