(Express Photo) \nThe MLA who resigned just after an election. Know all about Goa Cong’ Viswajit Rane who quit Congress legislator and senior Goa leader Vishwajit Rane is being accused of adding deep insult to Congress injury because he walked out of the state assembly before the BJP ’s Manohar Parrikar sought and won a vote of confidence. On the other hand, Mr Rane is very upset as Congress leadership failed to move fast inspite of winning maximum seats in the Assembly elections, 2017. He was a frontrunner for chief minister’s post as his father has been the chief minister of Goa five times and he was hopeful of becoming the chief minister. \nMr Rane has been very upset since the party failed to move quickly enough to win support after election results showed that Goa had given a majority to no party. The Congress had won the maximum seats, 17, but it was the BJP, with only 13 seats, that tapped smaller parties and individual winners to form a coalition and stake claim to run Goa. A disconsolate Mr Rane – who is the son of five-time Congress chief minister Pratap Rane – has accused the Congress central leader in charge of Goa, Digvijaya Singh, of “mismanagement”. \nAlso Watch: \nEven though Mr Rane’s presence would not have affected the result of the trust vote as Chief Minister Parrikar sailed through with 22 votes in his favour, one more than he needed in the 40-member house. 16 legislators voted against him, all from the Congress. It would have only been 17 had Mr Rane stayed and voted. \nAccording to a NDTC report, Mr Rane could not be traced for a while after he walked out of the state assembly today, and the Congress was stumped. “Vishwajeet Rane was with us…He took an oath and everything. But he walked out.,” said the party’s chandrakant kavlekar after the trust vote, adding, “We looked for him in the bathroom etc… have no idea where he is.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T08:06:23.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
