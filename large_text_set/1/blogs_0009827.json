Ghosting: \nBecause it makes you look like a child who can’t confront people, especially someone who cared about you or someone you were talking to for a while. You owe them an explanation, even if it hurts, but they have the right to know why. Also if you believe in karma, you’re really not going to be happy if someone ghosted you. 2. Assuming that the other person will not be able to handle the truth. \nDon’t assume that the other person is too sensitive or too emotional to handle it. Even if they are, they’ll always appreciate your honesty over your lies or excuses. What will really drive them crazy is the lack of closure, they could probably handle anything else. 3. Not responding to text messages. \nIf the person you’re talking to wants to have a conversation about what happened or asked you a question, you have to be upfront and answer them or at least acknowledge the other person’s feelings even if it makes you uncomfortable. 4. Not admitting that there’s someone else. \nIf you’re still not over an ex or if there is someone else that you’re talking to, you should say that before leading someone on instead of just coming up with excuses or slowly pulling away. It will make you look better and it means that you respect their feelings. 5. Not going away completely. \nIf you decide that you don’t want to talk to them anymore, you can’t send snapchats here and there or like their pictures or text them on special occasions because this gives them mixed signals and makes it hard for them to move on. 6. Telling them you’re not ready then start dating someone else shortly after. \nThis is the worst thing you could do to someone because it makes them feel like they were the problem or they weren’t good enough. If you didn’t think you were compatible or there was no chemistry, it’s better for you to say that instead of claiming that you’re not ready when you actually are. 7. Blocking them on social media without telling them why. \nThis sends the wrong message to the other person and it shows that you really don’t want to even know them again. If they never did anything bad to you and you blocked them, you need to at least let them know why, out of courtesy. 8. Taking serious conversations lightly. \nJust because you weren’t in a real relationship or you haven’t known each other for a long time, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give someone closure or clear answers. At one point you liked that person and cared about them and they deserve to know the truth regardless. It’s not a joke and it’s not unnecessary drama. 9. Pretending like nothing happened when you run into them. \nIf you weren’t able to have a real conversation with them, don’t act like everything is okay and back to normal when you see them. You have to understand that — one way or another — you hurt that person and unless you apologize or talk things out, you can’t expect things to be the same. 10. Lying about what you two were. \nWhen things end, even if it wasn’t official, you should at least say that you were talking or you liked each other instead of saying that you were ‘just friends.’ This just makes the other person feel like they meant nothing to you and that it was all a game.
