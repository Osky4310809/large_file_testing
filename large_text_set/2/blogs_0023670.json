The city is often referred to as the \"Athens of the East\" because of its similar architectural style, including many alleyways. During the heyday of its history, when the Nayak dynasty ruled, many magnificent temples and buildings were constructed. These days, Madurai attracts pilgrims and tourists in equal numbers. \nThe four hour walking tour led by Madurai Inhabitants is an excellent way of exploring and immersing yourself in the city. The company's guides are very knowledgeable and they offer a range of customizable tours. \nDon't miss these Madurai attractions and places to visit. Once you've seen the city, if you have some time spare, consider these private day trips to Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi or Trichy and Tanjore . Meenakshi Temple. Getty Images/CALLE MONTES 1. Meenakshi Temple \nThe Meenakshi Temple, a must-see south Indian temple , is the focal point of Madurai. Apparently, the city was built around the Shiva lingam that's inside its sanctum. The temple complex covers 15 acres, and has 4,500 pillars and 12 towers. You could easily spend days in there, as it's a \"living temple\" with a lot going on inside, including a constant stream of couples waiting to be married in its corridors. It's a least worth visiting the temple once in the morning and again in the evening for the night ceremony.

Puthu Mandapam \nVenture inside the cavernous Puthu Mandapam, a 17th century pillared entrance hall opposite the Meenakshi Temple's east tower, to find rows of tailors and stalls selling fabric, scarves, jewellery, fashion accessories, handicrafts, and art work. You can get good quality clothes made there, including decent replicas. \nBalbina Boutique, at shop 119, is popular with foreign customers. The lovely lady who runs it speaks excellent English. I bought a couple of stunning Madhubani paintings from her. Tirumalai Nayak Palace. Sharell Cook 3. Tirumalai Nayak Palace \nSituated around a kilometer southeast of Meenakshi Temple, Tirumalai Nayak Palace is Madurai's second biggest attraction. Built in 1636 by king Thirumalai Nayak, in Indo-Sarcenic style with the input of an Italian architect, it was his residential palace. Only a quarter of the original structure is intact, consisting of entrance hall, courtyard, dance hall, and audience hall. Substantial money was recently spent on major renovation works. \nThe entry fee is 50 rupees for foreigners, plus a 30 rupee camera fee. It's open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, except between 1-2 p.m. when it closes for lunch. There's a sound and light show every evening. Sharell Cook. 4.

Banana Market \nMadurai's wholesale banana market is a fascinating place to visit. Apparently, 16 varieties of bananas are sold there! They arrive, clustered together on branches, by the cart load. Watch as wiry workers unload them and carry them inside, up to half a dozen branches at a time. There's a vegetable market next to the banana market, which is also a hive of activity and great for people watching. Sharell Cook 6. Murugan Idli Shop \nIf you want to taste the best south Indian food in town, the renowned Murugan Idli Shop on West Masi Street is the place! This restaurant is simple and unpretentious -- as they say on their website, they have a south Indian ambiance, which means loud and friendly. Their specialty isn't their decor but the \"traditional mouth watering dishes from our grandmother's heart\". Apart from idli and dosai, the highlight is their special blend of spicy chutney powder. It's ordered separately, along with oil to mix it with. \nIf you're keen to explore local cuisine, Foodies Day Out in Madurai offers the best food tours in the city! More » Wikipedia. 7.

Gandhi took up wearing the dhoti in Madurai in 1921, as a sign of national pride. Admission to the Gandhi Memorial Museum is free, and it's open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. The Madurai Government Museum is also located in the same grounds. \nVisit the Museum on this Private Madurai Full Day Tour offered by Viator.

There you'll find one of the city's other impressive ancient temples, dedicated to Hindu god Murugan (handsome son of Lord Shiva), who's revered as a favorite god of Tamils. At the top of Thiruparankundram hill, there's also a 14th century grave shrine of the Islamic saint Hazrat Sultan Sikandhar Badhusha. Time seems to have stood still there, and a single family has taken care of the shrine generation after generation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:31.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
