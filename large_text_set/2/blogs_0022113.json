He arrived on the planet with no childhood, no parents, no family, and no friends. \nPerhaps it was Adam's loneliness that moved God to quickly present him with a companion, Eve . \nThe creation of Adam and Eve is found in two separate biblical accounts. The first, Genesis 1:26–31, shows the couple in their relationship to God and to the rest of creation. The second account, Genesis 2:4–3:24, reveals the origin of sin and God's plan for redeeming the human race. Adam's Bible Story \nBefore God created Eve, he had given Adam the Garden of Eden . It was his to enjoy, but he also had the full responsibility of taking care of it. Adam knew that one tree was off-limits, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. \nAdam would have taught Eve God's rules of the garden. She would have known it was forbidden to eat the fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden. When Satan tempted her, Eve was deceived. \nThen Eve offered the fruit to Adam, and the fate of the world was on his shoulders. As they ate the fruit, in that one act of rebellion, mankind's independence and disobedience (a.k.a., sin ) separated him from God. \nBut God had a plan already in place to deal with man's sin. The Bible tells the story of God's plan for man. And Adam is our beginning, or our human father. All followers of God in Jesus Christ are his descendants. Adam's Accomplishments in the Bible \nGod chose Adam to name the animals, making him the first zoologist. He was also the first landscaper and horticulturist, responsible to work the garden and care for the plants. He was the first man and the father of all humankind. He was the only man without a mother and a father. Adam's Strengths \nAdam was made in the image of God and shared a close relationship with his Creator. Adam's Weaknesses \nAdam neglected his God-given responsibility. He blamed Eve and made excuses for himself when he committed a sin. Rather than admit his error and face the truth, he hid from God in shame. Life Lessons \nAdam's story shows us that God wants his followers to freely choose to obey him and submit to him out of love. We also learn that nothing we do is hidden from God. Likewise, there is no benefit to us when we blame others for our own failings. We must accept personal responsibility. Hometown \nAdam began his life in the Garden of Eden but was later expelled by God. References to Adam in the Bible \nGenesis 1:26-5:5; 1 Chronicles 1:1; Luke 3:38; Romans 5:14; 1 Corinthians 15:22, 45; 1 Timothy 2:13-14.
