The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT) has been working tirelessly to rehabilitate this precious girl and help her grow into a healthy happy adult hippo . \nOne of Humpty’s favorite activities at the sanctuary is swimming in her personal pool , all day long until the sun sets. Watching her splashing and soaring through the air, begs the question – is she part porpoise ?! Her round, chubby body has not stopped Humpty from becoming the cutest baby hippo aquatic acrobat to ever exist. Not to mention, she is rather graceful for a hippo! \nRescue stories like Humpty’s bring a ray of light to the sad stories of the horrific poaching that occurs daily around the world. To fight this battle against poaching, there needs to be an increase in public awareness and added support for the organizations who are working to protect the world’s many wild animals. Help spread the word about sanctuaries like DSWT and check out their website for updates on Humpty and the rest of the gang! Want to read more posts like this?
