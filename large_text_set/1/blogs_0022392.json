January 25, 2017 by Maggie Pehanick 460 Shares \nWhile every moment of award season is exciting, any movie buff will tell you that the Academy Awards are the best part. This year's list of nominees was announced live on Tuesday, and it's packed with a lot of familiar faces and titles. La La Land is leading the pack with 14 nominations , an impressive number that ties the all-time nomination records set by All About Eve and Titanic . Meanwhile, Moonlight , Manchester by the Sea , Hacksaw Ridge , and Fences are all represented in several categories. And as if you needed confirmation, Meryl Streep is up for yet another Oscar . It's going to be a tight race this year! Take a look to see what else scored nods ( Suicide Squad ! Doctor Strange !), and tune in for the Oscars on Feb. 26! \nBEST PICTURE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:17:33.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
