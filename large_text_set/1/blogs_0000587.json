By different estimates from five to 40 million people lost up to $10 billion. The exact figures are not known even to the founders. \nThe scheme was banned in some African countries but has spread to Ghana and Kenya. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T10:12:09.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
