Samsung is looking to bounce back from the Note 7 , and so is LG from the G5 . But alongside the usual suspects, we also see BlackBerry and Nokia mounting a stronger return this year.\nBlackBerry had decided to outsource all of its manufacturing efforts , and we are waiting to see its first device since this decision. Nokia on the other hand, looks to make a comeback with the help of HMD Global. It even has managed to generate quite some interest for its first Android handset since the split from Microsoft.\nSo, our discussion for today:\nWill BlackBerry or Nokia be able to make it big in 2017? Or will they be among the many who were hyped but failed to perform? How far will their brand goodwill take each of them this year? Should these companies adopt any different approaches to taste success?
