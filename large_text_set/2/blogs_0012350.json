That racked up 7.5 million viewers. Second was CBS with “Superior Donuts,” which got 7.2 million viewers and “2 Broke Girls,” which had 6 million viewers and virtually no jokes that couldn’t have been written by an eighth-grader. \n“APB” on Fox was third with 4.5 million viewers. Considering I’d never heard of that show, that’s not a good augury for Schwarzenegger’s future. Then, I had never heard of the winner of “The New Celebrity Apprentice” either. It’s apparently some guy named Matt Iseman, who beat out 1980s pop omnishambles Boy George, according to UPI . \nOn the bright side, “Apprentice” did beat The CW’s “Jane the Virgin” and whatever was on Univision that night (I’m going to guess it was a show with a title like “ Comediante Gordo en Agua Caliente” or something to that effect).

Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary.” \nTrump even made a point to pray for Schwarzenegger’s performance during the National Prayer Breakfast, which was a bit of a dig. And that’s probably the best way to go about it. After all, only a Deity whose power knows no limitations could take Arnold Schwarzenegger forcing Boy George to run a lemonade stand (or something like that) and make it watchable. It certainly ain’t going to be NBC execs. \nPlease like and share on Facebook and Twitter with your thoughts on Schwarzenegger’s performance.
