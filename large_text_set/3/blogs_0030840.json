For those not in attendance, you can watch this quick replay to take in some of the action and reactions of New Yorkers going hands-on with the KEYone for the first time.\nOn the evening of Wednesday, March 22nd, BlackBerry fans in the greater NYC area braved the cold wind and converged at the Up & Down club to get an early look at the BlackBerry KEYone .\nWe had the venue to ourselves and the turnout was fantastic, with over 200 CrackBerry fans showing up to take a few engineering samples of the KEYone for a test drive. The reactions to the KEYone continue to be fantastic. Hit play on the video above for the 90 second highlight reel.\nThese CrackBerry meetups are such a blast, bringing out the hardcore BlackBerry fans who are just SOOO FREAK'N PASSIONATE. It was five hours of non-stop BlackBerry talk, mixed in with some tasty food and beverages, good music and a lot of fun taking photos in front of our CrackBerry/KEYone step and repeat.\nI hope to be announcing more cities soon to take our CrackBerry meetups too. Stay tuned.\nIn the meantime, THANK YOU NYC!!\nSign Up For KEYone Updates - We'll Tell You If A Meetup Is Coming To Your City! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T02:52:05.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
