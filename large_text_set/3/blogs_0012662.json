It wasn’t too long ago that we were talking about how Unilever, the owner Hellmann’s, tried to sue plant-based start-up Hampton Creek over the legal definition of “mayonnaise,” in light of the growing success of their premier product, Just Mayo . If you don’t recall the outcome, it ended with Unilever quickly dropping the lawsuit . Not long after that, Hellmann’s released their own version of vegan mayonnaise . Not only that, Unilever also owns Ben & Jerry’s, which just recently expanded its line of vegan ice cream . And the news just keeps getting better, because Unilever has just invested in Plant Meat Matters , a food development project spearheaded by researchers at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. \nWhile Plant Meat Matters started small as a collaboration between Wageningen University and Dutch food manufacturer, The Vegetarian Butcher , it has since gained the support of eight large companies , Unilever included. The project will be following in the footsteps of companies like Impossible Foods , the makers of “the burger that bleeds,” by attempting to create plant-based steak that is identical to meat. By using what is called, “shear-cell technology,” researchers hope to develop a product that mimics the taste and texture of steak . Not only does the Plant Meat Matters project hope to make their plant-based steak available to chefs and restaurateurs across the globe, they also want it to be available to home cooks by 2019 . \nIt’s no surprise that a corporate giant such as Unilever would want to be a part of this project. The plant-based food sector has topped $5 billion in annual sales, according to SPINS, the leading retail sales data company for the natural and specialty products industry. The plant-based meat sector, in particular, reached $606 million in sales in 2016, with refrigerated meat alternatives experiencing a growth of 15.9 percent . Plant-based protein is bigger than ever and companies are taking notice. Recently, the CEO of Tyson Foods, Inc , the world’s largest meat processor, admitted that plant-based protein is the future. Their five percent ownership in Beyond Meat, as well as their $150 million venture capital fund dedicated to developing “breakthrough technology” in the plant-based food space, is only a further testament to their dedication. \nPlant Meat Matters will be publishing most of their research as they make breakthroughs in food technology. According to Professor Atze Jan Van der Goot , professor of protein structuring and sustainability at Wageningen University and leader of the research team, this is to “give companies a head start compared to [those] that do not participate in the consortium … we aim for the technology to be used in route to contribute to a more sustainable diet worldwide.” Given the broad and varied health (personal and public) and environmental concerns associated with animal agriculture, this technology has the potential to foster the roots of a truly sustainable food system. And we have to commend their selflessness in ushering in the future of food ! \nImage source: The Vegetarian Butcher /Facebook  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T18:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T17:18:40.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
