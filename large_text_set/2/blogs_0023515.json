The team is already on the ground working in synergy with the Kaduna State Police Command and the locals. \n“The Nigeria Police Force, while assuring all Nigerians and foreign nationals in the country of their safety, wishes to implore them to always request and obtain police escort to protect them any time they are embarking on research, mining and related endeavours outside the towns and cities across the country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:28:36.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
