There is no shame in saving yourselves, your lives, and dignity,” he said. \nUnder Republic Act 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women, local government units are mandated to have violence against women (VAW) desks in every barangay to ensure women have a venue to seek help. \n“I call on provincial, city and municipal governments to ensure that the barangays within your jurisdictions do not only have a VAW desk but it should also be a functional desk that can effectively respond to VAW victims,” Sueno said.
