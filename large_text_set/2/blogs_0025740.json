Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Feb 24, 2017 | No Comments Pin Shares 101 \nEarlier today, Apple confirmed that the iOS 10.2.1 update greatly helped in reducing random shutdown issues that many iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s users were facing on their devices. As per the data received by the company, the “improvements” made in iOS 10.2.1 led to random shutdown issues reducing by more than 80 percent on the iPhone 6s and by over 70 percent on the iPhone 6. \nApple notes that on some older iPhones that it deems will require a battery change, it will automatically show a “your battery needs service” message in the Battery info menu in Settings. Do make sure that the message is not being displayed on your iPhone. If it is, then you will have to get the battery replaced to solve the random reboot issue. If not, have you seen an improvement with regards to your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s not randomly rebooting post the iOS 10.2.1 update? \nIf not, have you seen an improvement with regards to your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s not randomly rebooting post the iOS 10.2.1 update? And if it has, were you able to restart the device without having to plug it in? Take part in our poll below and do drop a comment to share your experience with us. Like this post?
