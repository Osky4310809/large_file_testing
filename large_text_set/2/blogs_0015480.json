Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHarry Potter ’s bratty cousin Dudley Dursley is all grown up and looking VERY different to the chubby youngster we all know and love. Or hate, given his character’s rather nasty treatment of poor Harry. \nActor Harry Melling has everyone talking after hitting the red carpet this weekend looking worlds away from the muggle that made him famous. \nHarry, who was only twelve years old when he appeared in Harry Potter and the Philospher’s Stone, was pictured at the premiere of his new movie The Lost City Of Z. \nHow different does he look now! Harry Melling is all grown up!

His character was an old man.

I was just starting drama school, and found I was moving around a lot. I also started to eat sensibly. The weight just dropped off. I went from 16st to 11st 5lb.\" \nAnd he added of moving on from Potter: \"I can now shed the child-actor thing, like the fat, and start a new career, because no one sees me as Dudley.\" \nOf course, he’s not the only Harry Potter child actor to have completely changed from his days on the wizarding movie.
