Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nMelania Trump, the new First Lady of the United States , wept as she observed a prayer service the morning after her husband's inauguration. \nIt was an incredibly busy day for the Trumps on Friday, visiting their new home at the White House, attending Donald's inaugural speeches , parades, and balls. \nHowever, the festivities didn't seem to have tired them out too much as the whole family woke early on Saturday morning to attend the National Prayer Service, along with Vice President Mike Pence and his wife. \nBut there was one moment which seemed to truly touch Melania Trump - when 20-year-old Marlana VanHoose sang to the congregation. \nMarlana, who is blind and has mild cerebral palsy, gave a poignant performance of the hymn How Great Thou Art. Donald and Melania Trump watch the service intently (Photo: Donald Trump Speeches and Rallies / YouTube) Read More Everyone is making the same joke about Melania Trump's blue inauguration outfit \nWhile Donald watched on intently, Melania seemed to be overcome with emotion and can be seen wiping away several tears, closing her eyes and shaking her head, seemingly in an attempt stifle her sobs. Melania had to wipe away a few tears while Marlana performed (Photo: Donald Trump Speeches and Rallies / YouTube) \nThe service is an inauguration tradition started by the first President of the USA, George Washington, and revived by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 - all incoming Presidents have attended them since. \nDuring the event, prayers were said to ask God to provide \"wisdom and protection\" for Trump and the USA, while readings were given in Hebrew and Arabic. \nMelania threatened to steal her husband's limelight on Inauguration Day, dazzling in a stunning off-shoulder gown she helped to design. \nShe was also compared to John F Kennedy's wife, Jackie, several times throughout the day as she changed into more elegant outfits. \nHowever, she was the target of social media users who thought her powder blue outfit was a dead ringer for the costume of Harry Potter characters - and everyone was making the same joke.
