While the 2017 edition is still 146 days away, today the Really Good Recordings boss has shared his hour-and-a-half 2016 Pagoda Stage set with THUMP. \nAs anybody who's seen him live before would expect, it's jam-packed with drum and bass, grime, hip-hop, and UK garage hits, not to mention a handful of his own skull-rattling edits and remixes (Big Krit's \"My Sub Pt. 3,\" Howie Lee's \"Flame Fighters,\" Travis Scott's \"Antidote,\" to name just a few). By the time he ends with the 1-2 punch of DJ Pump's slowed-down \"King Kunta\" edit and Diemantle's playful James Brown bootleg, you'll be booking your tickets to British Columbia for August. \nListen below while you wait for the snow to melt and get more info on Shambhala here .
