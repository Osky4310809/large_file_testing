And one day, when I have a bit more time and a whole lot more money I’m going to launch an in-depth, investigative report, complete with psychologists, historians and victims, on the reasons why White folk, particularly White women, have used Black folk, particularly Black men, as their scapegoats.\nThe subject of White lies is not something I spend my days and nights thinking or obsessing about. But every couple of months or so, it comes smashing to the forefront of my mind when another White person is caught in a lie, usually a particularly egregious, life or career-altering or threatening one. Today’s featured liar is musician Sinéad O’ Connor.\nSinéad O’ Connor Generally, when I see Sinéad O’ Connor’s name anywhere, I keep scrolling. I get the sense that a lot of things she says and does are an attempt to garner more attention and people like that generally annoy me. But today, I saw that her picture was next to Arsenio Hall’s so I wondered what that was about. They’re certainly not a pair you see together everyday. Turns out, in May, O’ Connor went to her Facebook page to write:\n“Two words for the DEA investigating where Prince got his drugs.?.?. Arsenio Hall (a.k.a. Prince’s and Eddie Murphy’s bitch). Anyone imagining Prince was not a longtime hard drug user is living in cloud cuckoo land. Arsenio I’ve reported you.” \nHall sued O’Connor for the remarks that same month. She called the lawsuit amusing before expounding:\n“I’m also very happy to notice that the DEA have taken me seriously enough to be thoroughly questioning all of Prince’s friends and aides from the last thirty years as to his KNOWN history of hard drug use and where he obtained his drugs. I do not like drugs killing musicians. And I do not like Arsenio Hall.” \nBut yesterday, O’Connor apologized for the accusations, telling TMZ that they were false.\n“I apologize for my Facebook posts about Arsenio Hall to the extent that anyone thought I was accusing him of acting as Prince’s drug dealer and supplying him with illegal hard drugs, or insinuating that Arsenio had something to do with Prince’s death…I sincerely apologize because those statements would be false and I retract them unequivocally.” \nWhy though Sinéad? Was the thirst so strong that you had to use Prince’s death to get some shine?\nThe post White Lies: Sinéad O’Connor And All The White People Who’ve Lied On Black Folk appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:00:21.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
