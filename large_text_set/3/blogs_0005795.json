Ted Cruz (R-TX) is weighing in on the Republican replacement for Obamacare bill. \nCruz has been the leader of the “Toss Obamacare” movement in Congress for years. \nHe joins some of the other senators and even President Donald Trump himself noting that there are issues with the replacement bill. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-0'); }); \nFrom Right Scoop, via Texas Tribune: googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-0'); }); \nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz gave a pessimistic prediction Wednesday for the new House Republican health care bill’s chances in the Senate — though he said the bill’s fate would be improved with some changes. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-1'); }); \n“The current draft in the House is a draft about which I have significant concerns,” he told reporters on a conference call. “As drafted, I do not believe this bill would pass the United States Senate. But I am encouraged and optimistic that we can resolve these differences.” \nHe’s happy that it’s started the ball rolling on the discussion although it has issues that need to be addressed. \n“I’m glad that the House of Representatives has introduced their legislation to repeal Obamacare,” he added, in his Wednesday remarks. “Yesterday, President Trump tweeted that this bill was now open for negotiation, and I think that is exactly right. There are vigorous debates that are ongoing [in Congress] about what the contours of this legislation should be.” \nCruz will be sitting down with Trump at the White House this evening. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-2'); }); \nHe and his wife will be joining Trump and his wife for dinner. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1448050117784-4'); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1464204305408-1'); }); \nCruz said the purpose was “social” but he expects they will discuss the health care plan. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-3'); }); \nSounds like a great opportunity to hash out some of the problems! googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1481811813211-4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T00:27:28.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
