Amid Musk's characteristically flamboyant announcement came skepticism about whether this will actually happen, at least on such a tight timeline. His company has yet to launch any humans into space. \nTwo private individuals, who are staying anonymous for now, \"have already paid a significant deposit to do a Moon mission,\" said a release on the rocket manufacturer's website. The pair will be flying in the Dragon 2 capsule on top of the beefed-up Falcon Heavy rocket, which is the next step in SpaceX's Falcon series. It's launching its first test flight this summer, and it if works, it will be the most powerful vehicle to get into orbit after NASA's Saturn V , which brought humans to the Moon, according to SpaceX. \nThe two people know each other, reporters were told. (No indication was given of whether they're male or female.) They will receive physical training, and will need to pass health and fitness tests to fly. It's unknown for now whether either has had any piloting or aircraft experience. \nRead More : See How SpaceX Wants To Travel The Solar System \nSimilar to the Falcon rockets, the Dragon 2 capsule is meant to be reusable in future missions. \nAs for cost, Musk told reporters on the call that the flight around the Moon will put them back similar to if they were planning to visit the International Space Station. Canadian billionaire Guy Laliberté reportedly paid $35 million for his trip in 2009. \nThis voyage around the Moon, expected to last one week, is contingent on the Dragon 2 flights which come before it. If the two other Dragon 2 flights to the ISS that are planned for 2018—an initial unmanned, and then subsequent manned, mission—go off without a hitch, then the private mission will get the greenlight. \nAlthough reactions have been generally positive, SpaceX's stated timeline has raised some eyebrows. Spaceflight is extraordinarily tricky, and other ambitious timelines have had to be pushed back . \nScience consultant Mika McKinnon tweeted that she doesn't expect the 2018 launch date to be met. She says there is still a lot to do before this launch happens and \"things take time.\" \nThe flight was made possible by the funding from NASA's Commercial Crew Program. According to the press release, NASA has encouraged private flights to offset the government's spaceflight costs and \"more flight reliability history is gained, benefiting both government and private missions.\" \nWhether it's going to happen in 2018 or not, space tourism is starting to really take off. If extremely rich people want to subsidize the start of the Space Age to say they've been around the Moon and back, I think I'm okay with that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:14:41.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
