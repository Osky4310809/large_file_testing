His latest feat is something of a retroactive accomplishment, but one that is a major feather in his cap nonetheless. “Tiimmy Turner,” one of his two world-conquering singles from last year, has just gone platinum.\nCongrats to @lifeofdesiigner for his @riaa_awards Platinum Certification on \"Timmy Turner\" #LOD #RIAA \nA photo posted by Def Jam Recordings (@defjamrecords) on Jan 24, 2017 at 11:01am PST \n\nThe news was broken via Def Jam’s Instagram account, who revealed that the single had met the RIAA’s requisite number of a million sales. As impressive as this fact is, it still pales in comparison to the statistics behind “Panda,” Desiigner’s king-making single that has gone multi-platinum over the past year and is currently up for a Grammy award. Given the ubiquity of that song, it will be a tough act to follow sales-wise, but then again, his career is only just beginning.\nRevisit the lyric video for “Tiimmy Turner” below.\n\nIn other music news, Gucci Mane has announced yet another new album, one that is seemingly named in reference to Migos’ “Bad and Boujee.” Get the scoop right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T12:18:34.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
