Trump has said the issue is \"very difficult\" for him.\nThe Republican president campaigned on a pledge to get tougher on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, playing on fears of violent crime while promising to build a wall on the border with Mexico and to stop potential terrorists from entering the country.\nDHS officials, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said that although any immigrant in the country illegally could be deported, the agency will prioritize those deemed as posing a threat.\nThese include recent entrants, those convicted of a crime and people charged but not convicted. Some details of the guidelines were detailed in a draft memo seen on Saturday.\nMany of the instructions will not be implemented immediately because they depend on Congress, a public comment period or negotiations with other nations, the officials said. Mexican immigration officials immediately objected to part of the new rules.\nThe guidance also calls for the hiring of 10,000 more U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) agents and 5,000 more U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents.\n\n'EXPEDITED REMOVALS' \nThe DHS will need to publish a notice in the Federal Register subject to review in order to implement one part of the plan that calls on ICE agents to increase the number of immigrants who are not given a hearing before being deported.\nThe new rules would subject immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to \"expedited removal.\" Currently, only migrants apprehended near the border who cannot show they have been in the country more than 14 days are subject to rapid removal.\nThe memos also instructs ICE to detain migrants who are awaiting a court decision on whether they will be deported or granted relief, such as asylum. DHS officials said they are reviewing what jurisdictions may have laws in place that prevent the amount of time immigrants can be held.\nThe agency also plans to send non-Mexican migrants crossing the southern U.S. border back into Mexico as they await a decision on their case. The DHS officials said this plan would be dependent on partnerships with the Mexican government and would not be implemented overnight.\nAn official with Mexico's immigration department said it is \"impossible for the United States to send deported or repatriated Central Americans to Mexico\" because of existing treaties between the United States and Mexico.\nThe guidelines were released a day before U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly were due in Mexico City for talks with President Enrique Pena Nieto and Mexican officials.\nTrump's planned measures against illegal immigrants have drawn protests, such as an event last week that activists called \"A Day Without Immigrants\" to highlight the importance of the foreign-born, who account for 13 percent of the U.S. population, or more than 40 million naturalized American citizens.\nInsideGov | Graphiq \n(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley in Washington; Additional reporting by Anahi Rama in Mexico city; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Frances Kerry) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:50:26.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
