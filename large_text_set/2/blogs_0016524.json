Called Sixth + Mill , the Italian-leaning restaurant will offer pizzas and pastas, and is set to be even more casual than its two predecessors. You won’t have to walk far from either of the Factory Place Hospitality team’s two concepts to get to Sixth + Mill: it’s landing right along 6th Street and is attached to Officine Brera (though they will have separate entrances). The building being used is the former LA Power Company warehouse, which means the same sort of soaring ceiling, brick-walled space so familiar to Downtown’s reconfigured spaces. Don’t expect casual a casual takeaway, though. Sixth + Mill will operate as a full-service restaurant under chef Angelo Auriana and restaurateur Matteo Ferdinandi, with sommelier/partner Francine Diamond-Ferdinandi pouring Italian wines to boot. No word yet on when Sixth + Mill will open, but construction is ongoing.
