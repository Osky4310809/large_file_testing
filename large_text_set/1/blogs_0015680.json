I will always thank MMM for saving my family from financial struggles in 2016. \n“I am one of the people who had money in the system before it went on a break and now I have been matched for payment. The comeback has encouraged some of my friends to sign up for MMM and I’m sure this comeback will encourage more to join.” \nMrs. Ayomide Olatunji, a housewife, said that she was not happy to hear of the new payment system, but she was sure it would pay off in the long run. \n“I can’t express my joy right now, knowing that I will be getting my money back soon. When I learned that the system prioritises those with smaller sums of money in the system and that there is a daily payment limit, I was really annoyed. \n“I have a larger sum of money in the system, so that means I will have to wait a while to get paid and my payment may come in installments; but I know it will pay off in the long run. These are necessary measures to prevent the programme from crashing in the near future,” she said. \nMr. Joshua Agim, an entrepreneur, said, “We know the dangers of this system, but the media and government should leave us alone. \n“The system successfully matched me yesterday and I am expecting my money and interest soon. This programme has helped me a lot and done for me what the government has failed to do. \n“Government has no right to arrest participants when most government officials are assumed to be busy looting our funds. Government and skeptics should just leave us alone. \n“People said the programme had crashed and they made jest of us; but now, we are back in business,’’ Agim said.
