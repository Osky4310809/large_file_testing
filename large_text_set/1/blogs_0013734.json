Those who wanted to make sure that they could be in the room where it happens had to endure a tense wait in an online queue, before buying tickets for performances over a year away. Fortunately, they’re willing to wait for it. The hip hop American history musical written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and much-loved by Barack Obama , is coming to the Victoria Palace Theatre in November. It premiered on Broadway in 2015 and has already won a Pulitzer Prize, a Grammy Award and eleven Tony Awards. Miranda tweeted to British fans that the time was nigh to book their tickets. — Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) January 16, 2017 Some weren’t organised enough and threw away their shot. When you didn't sign up for #Hamilton tickets five years ago so might as well give up on life now... pic.twitter.com/KV3Yj5ZB4g — Zoe Sharp (@zoelissima) January 16, 2017 Everyone got Hamilton tickets from the looks of things. I FORGOT. — Olly Gibbs (@ollyog) January 16, 2017 Oh God. I'm out on the high street and I forgot about Hamilton tickets. Those who got their hands on tickets were left feeling pretty satisfied. Just got presale tickets for Hamilton. Now gotta wait 367 days to see it. — Hannah White (@hannahvwhite) January 16, 2017 Tickets for Hamilton bought. Play it cool, Matt.
