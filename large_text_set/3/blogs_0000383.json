One such feed is that of Nancy McGuire , the VP of product development at Kat Von D Beauty. She often posts sneak peeks of upcoming launches from the cult-favorite brand, but two new videos she's shared have us positively spellbound. \nFans of Kat Von D's products know that they are quite durable and hold up to many longwear tests. But it seems that the product development team is working on ramping up its formulas to be basically semipermanent. In a series of videos, McGuire demonstrated how a series of mysterious swatches WILL NOT BUDGE when rubbed aggressively. (We're not ashamed to admit we watched this video five times in a row in great awe.) She then showed how they could be removed with Kat Von D Unlock-It Makeup Remover Wipes ($10). Basically, it's beauty sorcery. \nHere's hoping that these new products included in that swatch lineup get launched soon! We're looking forward to them with bated breath. In the meantime, though, we're watching these videos on repeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T04:09:00.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
