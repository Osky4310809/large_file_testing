Despite having dated for six long years, their only red carpet appearance together was for The Place Beyond the Pines — but that only happened because both of them starred in the movie.\nObviously, he was a bit more willing to be affectionate back in 2006.\nMichael Buckner/Getty Images Hey man, we all do things we regret in our 20s.\nMichael Buckner/Getty Images …Just, y’know, for most of us those “things” never included Ryan Gosling.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:00:54.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
