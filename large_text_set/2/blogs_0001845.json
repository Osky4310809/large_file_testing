In her latest Instagram, ColourPop’s CEO showed us what appears to be an old school Valentine’s Day card envelope, but we have a sneaking suspicion it contains some gorgeous makeup!\nWe know we sound like a broken record at this point, but we just can’t overstate how important it is beauty products have original, beautiful packaging! And brands like ColourPop who understand that always make their way into our hearts, especially when it’s holiday packaging — when is there a better time to embrace some kitsch than Valentine’s Day ?\nBecause everyone loves a Valentine ❤ \nA photo posted by Boss Lady (@colourpopbosslady) on Feb 1, 2017 at 7:21am PST \nHave you ever seen anything sweeter?\nNow, what could possibly be inside? Could it be the highlighters she teased us with yesterday?\nWorking on a new highlighter. What's your fave? Left to right ---> 1,2,3 \nA video posted by Boss Lady (@colourpopbosslady) on Jan 31, 2017 at 9:57am PST \nThat would be incredible! But our guts tell us it’s probably too soon for it.\nCould it be the outside of these beautiful eyeshadow duos? It has to be, don’t you think?\nThere is so much to show so here is a start. Gorgeous new shades in One of a Kind duo and the packaging is soooo cute! \nA photo posted by Boss Lady (@colourpopbosslady) on Jan 29, 2017 at 4:25pm PST \nIf that’s what they are, we are thrilled!\nWe’re doing our best Detective Benson impressions trying to figure these mysteries out for you all.\nWe are not the only ones desperate to know more information about this collection, like when is it coming out?! Valentine’s Day is in two weeks, inquiring minds must know! Boss Lady / www.instagram.com Boss Lady / www.instagram.com People are getting antsy, and we don’t blame them. We don’t want to miss out on our chance to wear these beauties during the holiday!\nWhat do you think the chances are that they’ll release this collection on actual Valentine’s Day? Would that be disappointing to you? We can’t decide. It makes sense to get it out early so people can wear it on the holiday, but it’s also a cute idea to release it on the day.\nEither way, we know this collection is going to be charming and lovely and we can’t wait to see it!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:09:34.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
