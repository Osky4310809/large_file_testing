Phil Shiner: struck off Credit: STEPHEN LOCK \nM r Shiner, who faces possible criminal investigation himself for fraud, lodged 2,470 criminal complaints against troops. \nThe parliamentary inquiry’s findings, due to be published on February 15, will cast serious doubt on the workings of the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat), which was set up by the Government in 2010. \nJohnny Mercer, the Conservative MP who chaired the inquiry and has repeatedly condemned the “witch hunt” against troops, last night accused “a rotten core” of civil servants within the MoD of making decisions “without ministerial or military” input.

Sir Michael pledged during testimony to the inquiry that he would be prepared to shut Ihat if the defence committee offered a workable alternative. There is a rotten core of civil servants in the MoD who have made decisions without Ministers or military input, and have in the process demonstrated a disturbing lack of understanding for the more subtle qualities that bind an army together Johnny Mercer \nM r Mercer, a former Army captain, told The Telegraph: “I have made my distaste for the methods and behaviour of Ihat - and the MoD’s complicity in it - very obvious over the last year. \n“The evidence has been clear and I look forward to publishing our report a week Wednesday.” \nAnd in a withering attack on Whitehall mandarins, he added: “I am pretty clear where the problems lie. \n\"There is a rotten core of civil servants in the MoD who have made decisions without Ministers or military input, and have in the process demonstrated a disturbing lack of understanding or respect for the more subtle qualities that bind an army together and make men fight for each other or a cause. \n“Things have improved this year but, prior to my investigation, there was no heed whatsoever paid to how this process has affected our people. That is a deep regret of mine.” FAQ | Iraq Historic Allegations Team \nT he inquiry report is expected to reserve its most damning criticism for a secret deal agreed between Ihat and PIL, in which staff from Shiner’s law firm were paid by Ihat to accompany Iraqi witnesses during interviews held in Turkey and in Lebanon. \nIhat, which is funded by the MoD, made 11 separate payments totalling £208,342 to Shiner’s law firm between October 2015 and July 2016 for legal expenses and fees for flying PIL lawyers and employees to interviews. \nThe payments were made despite the fact PIL, which has since shut down, had already been reported to the legal watchdog by the MoD over false claims of murder and torture made against troops during the £25m al-Sweady inquiry. \nSir Michael has said the MoD had no option but to make the payments because they were for work for Ihat that had already taken place. The inquiry report will also condemn payments totalling more than £110,000 to an Iraqi fixer who worked for both Shiner and for Ihat. Johnny Mercer during his time in the Army in 2010 \nT he agent Abu Jamal was paid to carry out administrative tasks for Ihat while at the same time was touting for business on behalf of PIL. \nThe MoD stopped the payments when it realised that Jamal was working for both sides but MPs are understood to be critical of why it took three years for the payments to come to light. \nMPs have expressed astonishment that the agent was paid by 'both sides’ as part of a criminal investigation. \nThe conclusions of the inquiry will delight veterans who have repeatedly expressed their disgust at the huge toll taken on them after finding themselves under Ihat investigation for historic events in war-torn Iraq.

There needs to be an immediate disclosure of all the cases in which Ihat have links with Shiner.” \nMiss Webster, who was officially cleared by Ihat in September two-and-a-half years after being arrested in a dawn raid, added: “Ihat needs to be disbanded immediately.” \nIhat has insisted that its investigations are handled with sensitivity but that it must follow through all complaints fully.
