Ragan drove for Front Row for four Cup seasons from 2012 through 2015, winning at Talladega in 2012 to give owner Bob Jenkins his first NASCAR Premier Series victory. \n“When I joined Front Row Motorsports back in December or January, we didn’t have a lot of races sold on the 38. We had (primary sponsors) CSX and Love’s Travel Stops coming back on the 34 car (of teammate Landon Cassill), and we had a couple of partners that were in the works on the 38, but we really hit it hard and I think at Front Row Motorsports we have a good story to tell. \n“We’ve made a huge investment on the competition side to continue to get a little bit better. Bob Jenkins has continued to leverage some of his businesses outside of racing to make it more interesting for new partners to join Front Row Motorsports. We’ve got a good price point, and I think we offer good return on their investment, so I think that over the last 60 days we’ve been able to sign (as sponsors) Camping World and Good Sam, Juice Batteries … Jacob Company is going to be on our car next weekend (at Phoenix) for their first race, so we’ve got a lot of inventory that we sold in a short amount of time.” \nAnd that’s always a good sign for any NASCAR team, especially a smaller, lower-budget team like Front Row. Ragan said that Juice Batteries would serve as a sponsor not just for this Sunday’s Kobalt 400, but “for multiple races.” The company specializes in making affordable rechargeable batteries. \n“Kudos to everybody at Front Row Motorsports and our sales staff for making some things work, but I think Bob has been able to keep Front Row Motorsports nice and steady and grow conservatively over the years,” Ragan said. “They’ve never really made a huge splash, but they consistently have gotten a little bit better on track and off track.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:12:20.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
