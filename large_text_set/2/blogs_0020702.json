Instead, God \"took him away.\" \nScripture does not reveal much about this remarkable man. We find his story in Genesis 5, in a long list of the descendants of Adam . Enoch Walked With God \nOnly a short sentence, \"Enoch walked faithfully with God,\" in Genesis 5:22 and repeated in Genesis 5:24 reveals why he was so special to his Creator. In this wicked period before the Flood , most men did not walk faithfully with God. They walked their own path, the crooked way of sin . \nEnoch did not keep silent about the sin around him. Jude says Enoch prophesied about those evil people: \n\"See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\" (Jude 1:14-15, NIV ) \nEnoch walked in faith the 365 years of his life, and that made all the difference. No matter what happened, he trusted God. He obeyed God. God loved Enoch so much he spared him the experience of death. \nHebrews 11, that great Faith Hall of Fame passage, says Enoch's faith pleased God: \nFor before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. (Hebrews 11:5-6, NIV ) \nWhat happened to Enoch? The Bible gives few details, other than to say: \n\"...then he was no more, because God took him away.\" (Genesis 5:24, NIV) \nOnly one other person in Scripture was honored this way: the prophet Elijah . God took that faithful servant to heaven in a whirlwind ( 2 Kings 2:11 ). \nEnoch's great-grandson, Noah , also \"walked faithfully with God\" ( Genesis 6:9 ). Because of his righteousness , only Noah and his family were spared in the Great Flood . Enoch's Accomplishments \nEnoch was a loyal follower of God. He told the truth despite opposition and ridicule.
