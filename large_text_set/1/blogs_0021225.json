President Donald Trump had promised that he would deport the “DREAMers,” the euphemism for applicants to the amnesty program, multiple times during his election campaign. \nSteve Blando, a spokesman for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a written statement Tuesday that the agency “is still accepting/processing DACA requests under existing policy.” \nThe issue of the DREAMers has been a contentious one that has cut across partisan lines, as some Republicans are looking to retain the “deferred” status for recipients, while others like Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) push for their special status to be absolutely rescinded. Meanwhile Democrats have vowed to protect those who received Obama’s amnesty already. \nCNN was unable to determine how many DREAMer applications were approved since Trump assumed the Oval Office, but since the program’s inception, there have been 750,000 approved applications. About 820 people applied for the program on a daily basis last year. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer indicated that the reprieve was only temporary, but offered very little details on what President Trump plans to do about the program. \nLate Tuesday the administration announced that Trump would be signing executive orders about immigration Wednesday, but few details were divulged about what they might be.
