Waymo , the self-driving car project of Google, filed a lawsuit on Thursday against Uber , alleging one of its former employees stole the proprietary design of its self-driving car system.\nAdvertisement \n\nAccording to the 28-page complaint filed in a California federal court (which is available below), Waymo says a former manager of the self-driving car project, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 “highly confidential and proprietary files shortly before his resignation.” The files—about 9.7 GB worth—included a design of Waymo’s LiDAR circuit board, which is key to making the system function.\nIn the run-up to the alleged theft, Levandowski informed colleagues that he planned to set up a new self-driving vehicle company, and Waymo alleged that he “appears to have taken multiple steps to maximize his profit and set up his own new venture” before leaving the company in January 2016. That venture was what’s now known as Otto, the self-driving truck company that launched in May 2016 and was soon-after acquired by Uber a few months later for $680 million.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe only reason why Waymo knows about this? According to the complaint, it accidentally was CC’d on an email. From the suit:\nWaymo was recently – and apparently inadvertently – copied on an email from one of its LiDAR component vendors. The email attached machine drawings of what purports to be an Uber LiDAR circuit board. This circuit board bears a striking resemblance to Waymo’s own highly confidential and proprietary design and reflects Waymo trade secrets. As this email shows, Otto and Uber are currently building and deploying (or intending to deploy) LiDAR systems (or system components) using Waymo’s trade secret designs. This email also shows that Otto and Uber’s LiDAR systems infringe multiple LiDAR technology patents awarded to Waymo.\nLiDAR is ultimately crucial for how self-driving cars can function; the technology works in tandem with cameras attached to the car to detect the vehicle’s surroundings and help the autonomous tech function properly.\nWaymo throws some serious shade on Uber and its ambitions to get into the self-driving car market, saying as of last August, it had “no in-house solution for LiDAR — despite 18 months with their faltering Carnegie Mellon University effort — and they acquired Otto to get it.” Woof.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:57:33.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
