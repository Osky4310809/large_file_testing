Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDonald Trump is at the centre of yet another scanda l just days before he is due to be inaugurated as President of the United States. \nA bombshell dossier, reportedly put together by a former British MI6 spy, claims Russia has 'compromising' evidence of Trump which it gathered in order to be able to blackmail him. \nThe memo, which is reportedly being investigated by the FBI, was first alluded to by CNN, then published in full by BuzzFeed on Tuesday night. \nThe billionaire businessman has described the story as \"fake news\" in a tweet. \nHere's a rundown on what we know, and don't know, about the scandal. What we know 1. President Obama and Trump have been briefed on the dossier US President Barack Obama (Photo: AFP) \nA two-page summary of the allegations were presented to Trump and Obama last week in meetings with the top intelligence chiefs in America. \nThey include Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers. \nThis was not to indicate they have verified any of the claims to be true. \nBut according to the New York Times, intelligence services believed the material so \"explosive\" it should be brought to the attention of the President and President-elect. \nOfficials were also concerned that it may leak before Trump knew of its existence, the NYT added. 2. The dossier has been around for some time \nPoliticians and journalists in Washington have been aware of the dossier since last autumn. \nOn October 31, 2016, MotherJones published a story entitled 'A Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump' Vladimir Putin (Photo: Getty) \nJournalist David Corn said he spoke to a \"former senior intelligence officer for a Western country\" who said he had evidence that \"the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump\". 3. It is unclear if the FBI is investigating the claims \nThe FBI has remained tight-lipped and not yet commented on-the-record about whether it is investigating the dossier. \nFBI Director James Comey refused to answer Senator Ron Wyden when asked if the agency was investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia. \nLast night Mr Wyden said: \"The American people have a right to know the answer to this question before January 20.\" 4. American security agencies ARE investigating Russian hacking of the election \nIntelligence agencies believe Vladimir Putin ordered a cyber hacking campaign to help Donald Trump win the US presidential election . \nA report produced by the CIA, the FBI and the NSA read: \"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.\" Donald Trump poses next to Miss Venezuela and Miss Universe in Moscow in 2013 (Photo: AFP) \n\"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. \n\"We have high confidence in these judgments.\" \nRussia denies the US government's allegations of hacking during the election campaign. 5. Donald Trump denies the claims \nTrump's team have not given a detailed comment, but the President-elect dismissed the story in typically bullish style. \nHe tweeted: \"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\" \nHis lawyer and adviser, Michael Cohen, has also denied a specific claim in the memo which claims he secretly met with Russian officials in Prague in August or September last year to talk about Russian hacking of Democrats. \nMr. Cohen tweeted on Tuesday night: What we don't know 1. Have any of the facts been checked? \nNone of the claims in the Trump dossier have been established as true at this point. \nThere are some abstract claims, such as Trump's \"unorthodox behaviour in Russia over the years\", but others are more concrete such as his lawyer Mr Cohen having visited Prague this year. \nThese should in theory be possible for intelligence agencies to verify as true or false.
