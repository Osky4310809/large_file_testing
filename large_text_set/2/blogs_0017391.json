Riding high off of an Anderson .Paak featured first single and production credits on Fat Joe and Remy Ma ‘s newest offering, Plata O Plomo, the two also dropped visuals for their Njomza & Alex and Alex featured single, “Right Now”.\nShot against the sunny backdrop and pristine waters of Cuba, the video celebrates is a vivid and soaringly expressive ode to living in the moment. “Baby, I don’t know about love but I know how to have fun,” says Albanian-American singer Njomza in the song’s first lines. It’s the kind of half-way sleazy but completely honest admission our generation tends to arrive at when it comes to matters of the heart versus matters of the party.\nWith February almost through and spring slowly but surely creeping up on us, “Right Now” is poised to be a carefree, warm weather anthem dance music lovers can get behind. Press play to enjoy.\nAlso see Major Lazer collaborator Cadenza dancehall-flavored ode to summer time right here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:52:05.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
