Standing up for every kid also means opposing @POTUS policies that hurt kids. \n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 22, 2017 \nKatie Rich, a writer for Saturday Night Live, recently made headlines for tweeting that the 10-year-old will become the country’s “first homeschool shooter.” I wonder why this @nbcsnl writer deleted her tweet about Baron Trump? pic.twitter.com/y9KJKPFdeN \n— Fash (@gopfashionista) January 20, 2017 \nAccording to Fox News , NBC has yet to comment on Rich’s tweet. She has reportedly deleted her account. \nBarron Trump is not homeschooled — he and his mother, first lady Melania Trump, will reportedly remain in New York so he can finish his current school year. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike condemned the attack on the 10-year-old. I read an article about people cyber bullying Barron Trump. He's just a kid. We can't choose our parents. Leave children out of it please. \n— cyd 🌞 (@cydhartha13) January 23, 2017 \nMembers of the media took issue with the comment as well. How can some people be SO cruel? I have seen mean tweets about Barron Trump..he is a KID! I block all those who are so cruel \n— Greta Van Susteren (@greta) January 21, 2017 That it even need be said is ridiculous, but mocking the 10-year-old child of a politician you loathe is odious, immoral, & self-defeating \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 21, 2017 Unless you have something nice to say, any comment about Barron Trump will get u blocked. Kids are off limits. \n— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) January 20, 2017 Rate this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T20:19:44.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
