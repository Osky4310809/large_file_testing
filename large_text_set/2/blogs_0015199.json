ID: 10568398 8. Jen Ashley Wright made a joke about Milo being called a provocateur in headlines about the news. What with Milo's book being cancelled, I see there is now a void for a \"provacteur\" to give 250K to. So I'll just say it: I love cannibalism\n— JenAshleyWright (@JenAshleyWright) ID: 10569282 9. Jason O. Gilbert also made a joke about S&S’s decision to cancel the book. Simon & Schuster cancelled Milo's book after he submitted a manuscript that was just the phrase \"lmao triggered much???\" for 300 pages\n— Jason O. Gilbert (@gilbertjasono) ID: 10569364 10.

Rigoberto González said S&S shouldn’t get a gold star for its “disingenuous posturing.” No, @simonschuster, no ⭐️ for your disingenuous posturing. It will survive its dragging. But how it deals w damage control will be telling.\n— Rigoberto González (@MariposaBoy) ID: 10569958 12. And when Russell Blackford suggested S&S’s decision was anti-free-speech, he received hundreds of replies criticizing his tweet. If a publisher can cancel Milo's book because he said something unpopular in an interview, it can do the same to you or me or any author.\n— Russell Blackford (@Metamagician) ID: 10569576 @Metamagician Wait a second… You mean one’s words/actions have consequences?
