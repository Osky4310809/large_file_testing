Up Next: Donald Glover Couldn't Say No To Lando Calrissian Role \nBut half of the fun is hearing all of R2’s cranky beeps and wondering what they mean in context with Threepios responses. \nWell, it was inevitable for someone to apply dialogue to the feisty droid, and we’re just surprised it took as long as it did. \nYouTubers Auralnauts teamed with voice actor Scheiffer Bates to provide dialogue to the astromech’s scenes in A New Hope , with the promise to do more based on fan response. \nWe’d say they did a great job here, providing comic relief outside of his protocol droid companion’s regurgitating responses. \nOne of the better parts (and a scene that puts a lot of prequel escapades in an embarrassing light) comes when they finally meet Obi-Wan Kenobi , who says he doesn’t remember owning any droids. \n“You seriously don't remember me? After everything we’ve been through? The arena on Geonosis? The daring raid on General Grievous’ ship to rescue Chancellor Palpatine? What about the time we first met when I repaired Queen Amidala’s star cruiser just in time to escape the Trade Federation blockade? NONE OF THIS RING’S A BELL TO YOU?” \nSpace dementia is a terrible thing. Maybe Obi-Wan just forgot all of those flipping lightsaber moves? \nAre you excited for R2-D2's glorious return in The Last Jedi ? Do you think Luke Skywalker will remember him?
