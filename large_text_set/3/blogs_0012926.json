It’s from a tech accessories company called Incipio . I’ve been using it since the iPhone 4s and have bought it for every upgrade I’m made since then. Thankfully, Incipio has also rolled out the case for the latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus . So I'm covered — literally — when I'm eligible for an upgrade.\nNot only does it protect my phone, it houses convenient storage for up to three credit cards. I use it to stow my MetroCard for easy access on my commute to and from work. It’s one less thing I have to remember to bring with me — if I have my phone on me, I have my MetroCard, too.\nIt doesn’t feel or look all that flashy, but it has the basics down pat. If you're in the market for a case for your new iPhone, or you're simply looking for a case that's a bit more practical for your day-to-day, I can't see you being disappointed with this one from Incipio. It has treated me well through a handful of phone upgrades, plenty of accidental drops, and countless subway rides to work, and I don't plan on switching anytime soon.\nAs a bonus, if you're sticking with an iPhone 6-era phone for a bit, the Stowaway case has never been cheaper; the 6s is going for as low as $13.55 and the 6s Plus for as low as $10.95 .\nIncipio Stowaway Card Case with Integrated Kickstand for iPhone 7, $18\nIncipio Stowaway Card Case with Integrated Kickstand for iPhone 7 Plus, $18\nThis article was originally published on 9/21/2016.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
