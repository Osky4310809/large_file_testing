Pinnick had said that CAF needs a new generation of leadership following the change of guards at the World Soccer-governing body, FIFA. Ahmad Ahmad \nAfter the Abuja meeting on Tuesday that endorsed the NFF president to contest for a seat on the executive committee of the Confederation of African Football, CAF, Pinnick confirmed to Sports Vanguard that the 57-year-old Ahmad would be guest of the Sports Minister today. \n‘’Yes, Ahmad will be in Nigeria tomorrow(today). He’ll be flying in from Burkina Faso. We’re yet to confirm his time of arrival. He’ll fly to Lagos first and we’ll fly together to Abuja where he will meet Sports Minister Barrister Solomon Dalung and other football stakeholders’’, Amaju said on our hotline. \nAhmad will come up against Caf incumbent, Issa Hayatou in an election set for March 16 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. \n“It’s time to move beyond a three decades long reign. Caf is not a kingdom. I think there could never have been a better time to honour the life president Hayatou with a befitting event and bring this era to an end’’, one of the supporters of Ahmad said. \nAhmad, a member of the Caf Executive Committee, is currently in his third period of office with Madagascar. \nHayatou, who has ruled the African game since 1988, is seeking an eighth term.
