He and the other officials were being briefed on what exactly was in the planned executive order. \n“Halfway into the briefing, someone on the call looked up at a television in his office,” the Times reports. “‘The president is signing the executive order that we’re discussing,’ the official said, stunned.” \nPer most reports, the executive order was written and pushed by the president’s political appointees, former congressional aide Stephen Miller and former Breitbart chief Steve Bannon . MSNBC reported Monday morning that those in the relevant agencies are furious with Miller in particular , and claim the order was signed without review from them or White House lawyers. \n[Image via Shutterstock]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T16:19:53.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
