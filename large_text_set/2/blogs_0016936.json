Yep, absolutely. In computational benchmarks those six cores run rings around its Skylake cousin.” \n“While it’s a no-frills processor, as it’s only a dual-core model, and lacks Turbo Mode or hyper-threading, this is still enough to drive the majority of games at playable resolution and detail settings.” \nA note on affiliates: some of our stories, like this one, include affiliate links to online stores.
