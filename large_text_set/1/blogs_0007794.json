People wait in line to buy coffee at a convenience store in Seoul. \nOffice worker Lee Joon-il (38) does the math. \"A cup of coffee after lunch would cost as much as the meal itself,\" he says. \"So now I enjoy convenience-store coffee, which isn't bad.\" \nThe idea, like so many, started in Japan in 2012, when 7-Eleven rolled out its 100-yen coffee. It was a hit among salarymen who were no longer flush with cash, and rivals Family Mart and Lawson followed suit. \nIn convenience stores in Korea a cup of Americano coffee costs W1,000-W1,200 and a latte W1,500 (US$1=W1,204) . \nA Starbucks or other conventional coffee shop has to factor in the cost of furnishings and overheads, but a convenience store just needs to set aside a few square centimeters of counter and train staff for half a day. That means convenience stores can afford to sell coffee three to four times cheaper. \nThe development is particularly challenging not only for big franchises like Starbucks but also medium chains that thrive on takeaway coffee. At Ediya and Paik's Coffee, a cup of Americano costs around W3,000, cheaper than at Starbucks but still a lot more expensive than in a convenience store. \nAn Ediya staffer said, \"Convenience stores just sell Americano or latte, so we'll have to differentiate ourselves by selling a wider range of coffee that's better quality.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:45:39.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
