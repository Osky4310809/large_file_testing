Instead, it was forced to make an emergency landing in Nunavut’s capital due to what the airline called a “technical irregularity.”\n“The real issue was they only had one engine, but despite that it was a smooth landing,” said Iqaluit airport director John Hawkins.\n“Would you believe me if I told you the plane I was in lost an engine and now I’m stuck in the middle of the North Pole?,” Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter Leroy Sanchez said in a tweet.\nBut all was not lost for Sanchez and the other jet-setting passengers suddenly stranded in the high Arctic in February — they got a tour of Iqaluit in a heated bus.\n. @FlySWISS flight 40 landing at @IqaluitAirport pic.twitter.com/Go9YxdxFMe \n— ᑯᐹᒃ ᐅᒃᑯᖅ ᑕᑦᑐᐃᓂ (@tattuinee) February 1, 2017 \n\nIqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern wasn’t sure what would be included on the tour, but Hawkins said the museum and the swimming pool were two places he’d suggest.\n“Iqaluit is a spectacular place, they only have a few hours so there’s no way they’ll see it all,” said Hawkins.\nThe Boeing 777, which can hold up to 295 passengers, landed smoothly, but then had difficulty turning around. There were no injuries.\nAlong with a tour of the community, the passengers were fed. Food is pricey in the far north, and a jug of orange juice can cost over $26 in Iqaluit so the passengers would have been advised to wait for L.A before enjoying that California specialty.\nA replacement airplane was sent from New York to pick them up “so they will not be staying overnight,” said Redfern Wednesday evening. Although the exact number of passengers was not released, 295 people would increase Iqaluit’s population of 6,699 by more than four per cent.\nIt’s a good thing there was no plan to have them stay overnight because “there aren’t enough nearly enough hotel rooms. There’s a recreational hall we could put people in if we had to,” said Hawkins.\nAlice Hebb, front desk agent at Capital Suites Iqaluit, booked a room for at least one of the passengers.\nHebb said that while there are only four hotels in Iqaluit, if people did need to stay overnight there’s always a backup plan: “I’m sure if enough people in town know about it they’ll start opening up their doors.”\nWith a file from The Canadian Press \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:40:50.143+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
