Posted 13 hours ago 6 \nNu-metal was a big thing in the '00s but now the nu-metal scene is kinda dead so let's remember some of the most acclaimed songs of the genre. \nBefore starting the list, here are honorable mentions: Godsmack - I Stand Alone Ill Ni√±o - How Can I Live Taproot - Poem Adema - The Way You Like It Spineshank - New Disease Nonpoint - In the Air Tonight Coal Chamber - Loco 10. Papa Roach - Last Resort \nMost famous line: \n\"Cut my life into pieces This is my last resort...\" \nThis was the first official single for Papa Roach - and it's their biggest hit until today. They recorded for an independent label for five years before signing with Dreamworks. Papa Roach's Tobin Esperance says the band did not expect \"Last Resort\" to be as big as it was: \"No one ever thought it was going to be a huge, huge hit, but I guess you never expect anything, really, when you're first starting out.\" Originally written for a good friend of the band, the song is described by the lead singer Jacoby Shaddix as \"cry for help.\" 9. Drowning Pool - Bodies \n\"Let the bodies hit the floor Let the bodies hit the floor...\" \nReleased in May 2001, the song is Drowning Pool's signature song and has been featured in various films, TV programs, and advertisements since its release. It was written when the band's uitarist C.J. Pierce came up with the riff, and lead singer Dave Williams added the line \"Let the bodies hit the floor,\" which became the basis for the song. 8. Limp Bizkit - Rollin' \nMost famous line: \n\"Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'...\" \n\"Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)\" was a second single by Limp Bizkit from their third album \"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.\" A remix of the song titled \"Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle),\" featuring hip-hop artists DMX, Redman and Method Man and produced by Swizz Beatz, was also featured on the album. This hip-hop version is how the song was conceived. \"Rollin' was originally going to be just a straight Hip-Hop song,\" guitarist Wes Borland told. \"But after we heard it, we were like, 'No, man, we've got to turn this into a Rock song.' We liked both versions so much that that's what it ended up being, two versions: a Hip-Hop version of the song and a Rock version of the song.\" 7. P.O.D. - Alive \n\"I feel so alive For the very first time...\" \nReleased in July 2001 as the lead single from their fourth studio album \"Satellite,\" \"Alive\" is arguably the band's most popular song. P.O.D. writes their music first, and before they added lyrics to this track, they referred to it as \"Beautiful,\" since that's how the music made them feel. Sandoval wrote appropriately upbeat words to match the music. 6. Disturbed - Down With the Sickness \nMost famous line: \n\"Ooh-wah-ah-ah-ah!..\" \nOne of Disturbed's best-known songs and a concert staple, \"Down With the Sickness\" was released as the third single from their debut studio album, \"The Sickness.\" It features a famous \"ooh-wah-ah-ah-ah\" staccato noise from Disturbed's singer David Draiman at the end of the intro, which reappears from time to time throughout the song. Draiman has stated the sound was made possible by effects on his vocal cords after receiving surgery for acid reflux, but he has dismissed the rumor the noise was actually caused by heartburn, further explaining, \"I mean the song originally was written and just had a pause. Mikey's [drummer Mike Wengren] beat is just so tribal and you know it just made me feel like an animal... [The noise] came out one day.\" 5. Deftones - My Own Summer (Shove It) \nMost famous line: \n\"Shove it, shove it, shove it!..\" \nThis was the biggest hit for the Deftones, who released their first album in 1995 and spent time opening for Ozzy Osbourne and Korn. It was written in Seattle during the hot summer of 1994. Trapped inside of his room by the heat and sun, Chino Moreno boarded up his windows with aluminum foil and wished for \"An apocalyptic-type thing\" where all of the people on the streets would disappear and the sun would go away. He called this dream world \"his own summer,\" which is where the song title comes from. 4. Linkin Park - In the End \nMost famous line:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:42:01.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
