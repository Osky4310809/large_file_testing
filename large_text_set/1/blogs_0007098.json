In fact, it's considered just another cost of doing business.\nFor the Obama administration, it was the price they paid to keep Iran at the negotiating table so that a deal on their nuclear program could be hammered out.\nAn Iranian official has confirmed that the US sent the Iranian central bank more than $10 billion in cash, gold, and other assets since 2013. Since the nuclear agreement, we have been sending Iran $700 million a month. That money includes the $1.7 billion paid in ransom for US sailors being held hostage by the regime.\nWashington Free Beacon:\nThe latest disclosure by Iran, which comports with previous claims about the Obama administration obfuscating details about its cash transfers to Iran—including a $1.7 billion cash payment included in a ransom to free Americans—sheds further light on the White House’s back room dealings to bolster Iran’s economy and preserve the Iran nuclear agreement.\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi confirmed last week a recent report in the Wall Street Journal detailing some $10 billion in cash and assets provided to Iran since 2013, when the administration was engaging in sensitive diplomacy with Tehran aimed at securing the nuclear deal.\nGhasemi disclosed that the $10 billion figure just scratches the surface of the total amount given to Iran by the United States over the past several years.\n“I will not speak about the precise amount,” Ghasemi was Quote: d as saying in Persian language reports independently translated for the Washington Free Beacon .\nThe $10 billion figure is actually a “stingy” estimate, Ghasemi claimed, adding that a combination of cash, gold, and other assets was sent by Washington to Iran’s Central Bank and subsequently “spent.”\n“This report is true but the value was higher,” Ghassemi was Quote: d as saying.\n“After the Geneva conference and the resulting agreement, it was decided that $700 million dollars were to be dispensed per month” by the U.S., according to Ghassemi. “In addition to the cash funds which we received, we [also] received our deliveries in gold, bullion, and other things.”\nRegional experts who spoke to the Free Beacon about these disclosures said that the $10 billion figure offered by the Obama administration should be viewed “as a conservative estimate for what Iran was paid to stay at the table and negotiate.”\n“Iran does have incentives to overstate this figure,” Behnam Ben Taleblu, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Free Beacon . “But given the recent state-sponsored narrative in Iran about a Western and particularly American failing to offer sanctions relief, this reads much more as fact rather than another instance of disinformation from Tehran.”\nIt is likely Iran spent a portion of this money to fund its regional terror operations and military enterprise to bolster embattled Syrian President Bashar al Assad, Ben Taleblu said.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/09/iran-claims-us-gave-them-more-than-10-billion-in-cash-since-2013/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": ["http://freebeacon.com/national-security/iran-u-s-surrendered-10-billion-gold-cash-assets/", "https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/82371394/&source=gmail&ust=1484001883368000&usg=AFQjCNE87GHUL9LM2A5Qzo81tmVsYiShuQ", "http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/82371394/"], "published": "2017-01-09T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:41:09.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
