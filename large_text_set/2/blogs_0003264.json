Posted 17 hours ago 0 \nBassist Andriy Vasylenko presented an interesting video, featuring his take on what would Metallica's \" ...And Justice for All \" album sound like if late great Cliff Burton played on it. \nThe musician explained: \"Of course you've thought about it - what if Cliff were still alive and recorded all the Metallica albums featured Jason Newsted.
