So we actually gave people too much to eat.” (PTI) \nFormer Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose party suffered a shocking defeat in Assembly polls, has said that his party “gave people too much to eat” while in power. Speaking over the defeat, Badal said: “It is like if someone eats too much, he ends up vomiting. So we actually gave people too much to eat.” Badal, who is the president of Shiromani Akali Dal, said that people will realise the value of his party after suffering drought for 5 years. SAD, along with its long-time alliance, BJP lost the elections miserably coming third. In what appeared to be an arrogant statement from a politician’s part, Badal added that people did not understand the difference between good and bad until they acknowledge things. Badal, rather than accepting the defeat, put the blame on people’s head and voters did not acknowledge the good works of his party. Badal was accompanied by SAD leader Mantar Singh Brar, who urged people to ask the Indian National Congress to deliver on their promises of loan waiving and job opportunity for every family. \nAlso watch: Amarinder Singh takes oath as Punjab CM \nEarlier yesterday, Captain Amarinder Singh of the Congress, took oath as the new Chief Minister of Punjab. The ceremony which took place at the Punjab Raj Bhawan was administrated by the governor of the state, P Singh Badnore. Meanwhile, the party put rest to the speculations that had suggested that Navjot Singh Sidhu would be awarded the post of the Deputy CM. Instead, Sidhu has been allotted a very low profile ministry.
