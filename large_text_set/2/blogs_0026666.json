Users started to notice that their phones were shutting down unexpectedly. Turns out that Apple’s recent iOS 10.2.1 patch may have fixed those problems by as much as 80 percent.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com Speaking with TechCrunch recently, Apple offered this statement:\nWith iOS 10.2.1, Apple made improvements to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns that a small number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we’ve received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we’re seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down.\nWe also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It is important to note that these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.\nUpdate to iOS 10.2.1 if you’re having this problem Apple had explained early on that the phones were shutting down even when the battery still showed a charge, sometimes as much as 30 percent left in the tank. It released a patch that provided diagnostics data and seems to have been able to use that to largely fix the problem – though clearly not entirely – through software updates alone. It also fixes similar issues related to the iPhone 6, though, as Apple points out, the success rate is about 70 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:00:39.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
