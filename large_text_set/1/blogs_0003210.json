The cold air was accompanied by accumulating snow to near sea level in Washington on New Year's Day. \nOver the Southwest, including Southern California and southern Arizona, the chilliest days will be the first part of the week as temperatures will moderate late in the week. Cold air will hang on much of the week in the Northwest. \n\"The main thrust of the cold air will extend from the northern Rockies to the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest,\" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Evan Duffey. \nIn this swath, a snowstorm will precede the arrival of the arctic air. \nBy the middle of the week, actual temperatures will bottom as low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit below-zero and will rival the coldest air of the season so far over the northern tier of the Central states. AccuWeather RealFeelÂ® Temperatures over part of the northern Plains and Rockies can dip as low as minus 40 for a time. \nCold air will sweep to the Atlantic coast and will penetrate into part of the Deep South. \nThe cold blast will follow an early-week surge of mild air with rain and even severe thunderstorms in some locations. \nPeople in the Chicago area will endure at least a couple of days with highs in the teens and low temperatures in the single digits at the end of the week. Temperatures at these levels are 15 to 20 degrees below average even for January. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T14:39:44.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
