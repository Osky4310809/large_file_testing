ADVERTISEMENT \nNow this is being attempted in volleyball and most coaches have welcomed the innovation but recognize the challenge of matching up even after taking the first set of a match. \nIt’s volleyball, given that coaches rely on a strong starting six. The game is anchored on fluidity and chemistry that six players and one libero have to learn to play a solid game as one unit. Very often two to three players will come off the bench, either to change the setter, add a taller blocker or insert a reliable server. \nThe rest of the team seems accustomed to the reality that they will most likely not play in a game unless the game becomes too one-sided, an injury downs a starter or the coach simply wants to try something new. The “second six,” as volleyball often likes to call the reserves, does most of its work in training, pushing the starting lineup to play better. \nThe current innovation will give the six competing teams—Cignal, Petron, Generika-Ayala, Foton and newcomers CocoLife and Sta. Lucia—a chance to use more of their players, many of whom are stars from the collegiate ranks. It can be disappointing at times when you see a former college standout languishing on the sideline simply because there are other better stars on the team or their skills are not needed in certain game situations. \nWith the innovation, expect that there will be more extended matches than three-set shutouts although powerhouse Petron did exactly that against newcomer Sta. Lucia in the third game on opening day. Four sets per match might become the norm given the “second six” rule but that shouldn’t disappoint volleyball diehard who relish the extended action. \nLet’s hope that the rule also brings out the best in many of the players who now get the chance to strut their wares alongside the acknowledged stars of the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:51:32.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
