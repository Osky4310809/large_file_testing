We wonder what Justin Bieber will make of the message? (Photo: Getty) \nAddressing \"Mr Bieber, not Justin Bieber\" - presumably out of respect, or maybe he's talking to another Mr Bieber, honestly we're so confused at this point we don't know what is going on - he asks him how he is... he then shows off his watch... \nThis is what Alexis Sanchez made of it.
