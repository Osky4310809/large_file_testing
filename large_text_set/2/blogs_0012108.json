Advertisement \nRally Sweden has the most infamous long jump in all of rallying—Colin’s Crest—and over this past weekend, driver Louise Cook had the nightmare experience of not being able to see where she was going to land thanks to a hood failure. \nCook was running in the WRC 3 class over the weekend, but rolled her Ford Fiesta on Stage 2 of the event. Nevertheless, she drove on, only to have her mended front end fail spectacularly later during the rally. \nThe hood came loose while airborne after Colin’s Crest, sending her light pod flapping in the wind and blocking the front windshield of the car. \nColin’s Crest has an annual award for which driver jumps the farthest on it, so it’s no joke. Cook pushed on through it anyway, but ultimately ended up having to retire due to a technicality over a replacement seat bracket that wasn’t homologated with her car. (Boo!) Advertisement \nCook also lost her bumper before Colin’s Crest, and as with Mads Østberg’s lost wing , a fan found it and returned it to her. \nSweden has the best fans, man.
