Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFrom the Special One and then the Happy One at Chelsea, Jose Mourino has claimed he has now matured into the Peaceful One at Manchester United . \nThe Portuguese insists he is still fiercely competitive, as shown for the ban he served for kicking a water bottle on the touchline this season. \nBut now 54, he insists he has changed when he is away from the unrelenting spotlight of the Premier League. \n“Mourinho the man tries to be the opposite of what the manager is,” he said. “He tries to be discreet, calm and find the way to get away from it all. \n“I can go home and not watch a football match, not think football. I can do it. At the beginning of my career, I could not. I was constantly plugged in 24 hours a day.

Today, I feel good with my personality as a man. I have matured, I am more peaceful. A victory no longer represents the moon, and a defeat is no longer hell. \n“And I believe that I am able to pass on this calmness to those who work with me, to my players. I have the same ambitions as before. The same involvement, the same professionalism. But I’m more in control of my emotions.” \nWhen Mourinho became the first Manchester United boss ever to win a trophy in his first season, he hardly looked overjoyed after the EFL Cup final. It was not the same man who sprang to fame here by sprinting down the Old Trafford touchline as Porto boss in 2004. \n“I can hide my emotions,” he claimed. “And hiding them is a way of controlling them. After the EFL Cup final, I was super happy. Did I show it? I am not sure. Not at all, even.

In the dressing room, it was another thing. There, I showed how I felt, shared the joy. \n“But I try to control my feelings, and above all my frustration. In that final, there were times where I was not happy with the way we were playing, but I tried to understand the context, the circumstances, be dispassionate and transmit this to the players. In all these aspects, I am better than before.” Mourinho wants to create stability (Photo: REUTERS) Read More Manchester United are heading to the US this summer for a five-game tour \nMourinho also revealed he wants to create “stability” in his squad by establishing “a relationship of peace and love”. \n“From a psychological point of view, the stronger the bonding in a group and the better the relationships between the players, the more ready you are.” he told France Football. \n“The ‘mind games’, which involves trying to manipulate someone psychologically via the media, is a way to create a state of mind, but it is most effective when you have a team stuffed full of personalities who are ready to take in this kind of speech. So before you go in a direction, you first have to understand the people you work with.” poll loading Will Jose Mourinho win the Premier League title during his time with Manchester United? 2000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:24:09.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
