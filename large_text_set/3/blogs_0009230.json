You’re also aware of when the handset is going to be officially launched. All that’s left to know is how much are both models of the new flagship going to cost and what colors they will be available. Samsung will obviously not confirm this information before March 29 which is when it’s going to unveil the Galaxy S8 but according to a new report, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will be available in three different colors. \nIt’s claimed that the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will be available in Silver, Black and Violet colors. The last one sounds a bit interesting but Violet isn’t a color that’s too common with Samsung flagships. It’s also claimed that the 5.7-inch Galaxy S8 will cost 799 euro while the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus will be priced at a hefty 899 euro. If this is true, the new flagship will be a bit more expensive than its predecessor as Samsung priced the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge at 699 and 799 euro respectively after launch. \nNone of this has been confirmed officially, though, so take it with a grain of salt until there’s more evidence to support the theory. We’ll be on the ground in London on March 29 to bring you all of the latest developments from Samsung’s Galaxy S8 launch event .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T04:15:40.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
