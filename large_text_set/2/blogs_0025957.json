Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports/Orlando Jorge Ramirez Feb 27, 2017 at 6:17p ET 0Shares \nINDIANAPOLIS — The Indianapolis Colts have signed free agent offensive lineman Fahn Cooper. \nHe spent all of last season on the San Francisco 49ers practice squad. Indy is hoping the 6-foot-5, 306-pound swing lineman can help bolster a line that struggled most of the first three months last season. \nCooper is capable of playing either guard or tackle and was with the 49ers in training camp as a rookie. The fifth-round pick was released during the final cutdown in September and was later re-signed to the practice squad. \nAt Mississippi, Cooper was awarded the Kent Hull Trophy, which goes to the school’s top lineman. \nNew general manager Chris Ballard and coach Chuck Pagano are preparing for this week’s NFL’s annual scouting combine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:44:07.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
