Photo by T-Mobile/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nIt's a new year, so you might expect cellphone carriers to wish each other well. \nYou might also expect Carrot Top to be the new secretary-general of the United Nations. \nNo sooner has 2017 seen pharma bro Martin Shkreli have dog poop tossed at him than T-Mobile comes out to lob dirt at Verizon. \nIn a new ad , the self-styled Uncarrier accuses Verizon of being dog-eared. \nHere we see a dog watching soft dog porn on a phone. Suddenly, his Verizon data runs out. \"Why doesn't Verizon offer unlimited data like T-Mobile?\" he gruffs. \n\"Is it because their LTE network was built six years ago?\" wonders another pooch. Six years, explains a third dog, is like 100 in phone years. \nT-Mobile explains that Verizon's network is slow as well as old, whereas T-Mobile's is apparently shiny and sharp. \nThis is merely the latest chapter in what is now a years-long saga of carriers insisting they are better than their rivals, by denigrating those rivals as much as their lawyers will let them. \nVerizon hasn't been immune from this sniping.
