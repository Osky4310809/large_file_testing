[Photo/Xinhua] \nWASHINGTON - Thousands of protesters rallied in front of the White House on Sunday while demonstrations continued across more than 30 American airports after   signed an executive order temporarily barring all refugees and seven Mideast and North African countries' citizens from entry into the US. \nThe Lafayette Square before the White House was packed by protesters against Trump's ban from noontime as more demonstrators were still arriving, witnesses said. \nThey wielded poster boards bearing messages such as \"Ban Trump\" \"Refugees Welcome\" and chanted \"No hate! No fear! Refugees are welcome here!\" \nProtests are also scheduled throughout the day in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago, said a CNN report. \nIn Boston's Copley Square, thousands of people also gathered to protest the immigration ban, according to a report from the USA Today. \nEarlier on Sunday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the international travel disruptions in the wake of the ban was \"a small price to pay\" for greater security of the United States. \nOn contrary, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Sunday said Democrats are considering legal actions to overturn the order. \nA federal judge in New York on Saturday night granted an emergency stay temporarily halting the removal of people who, though with previously approved refugee applications or with valid visas, had ben detained following Trump's refugee and immigration order. \nSimilar rulings were later issued in Virginia, Massachusetts and Washington state, said a TheHill news daily report. \nUnder the order, refugees from all over the world will be suspended US entry for 120 days while all immigration from so-called \"countries with terrorism concerns\" will be suspended for 90 days. Countries included in the ban are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.
