For SS17, the sportswear giant has announced the Zoku Runner Ultraknit which utilizes the technology for the first time.\nSimilar to lifestyle runners such as the Ultra Boost and Racer, the sneaker offers a modern refresh of classic titles which have come previously (“Zoku” means to be continued, or part of a tribe). A molded TPU cage offers support on the sock-like upper, while a DMX Foam (woof woof) midsole is incorporated for additional cushioning. With no room afforded to trivial design affectations, the shoe arrives in super-clean “Flat Grey,” “Solid Grey,” and “Coral Black” colorways.\nThe Zoku Runner Ultraknit arrives on March 2 for €129.95 (approx $138).
