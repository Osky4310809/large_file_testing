He said that people have a \"third eye\" like Lord Shiva to see the truth by themselves and not get swayed by lies. By: FE Online | Updated:  42 PM PM Narendra Modi addressed a rally in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh today. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi today addressed an election rally in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh. His speech came a day after BJP recorded stupendous success in Maharashtra urban bodies’ polls. BJP won 8 out of 10 municipal corporations in Maharashtra and pushed the Congress further towards irrelevance. PM Modi thanked people of Maharashtra for seeing the truth with their eyes and supporting BJP, even when opposition tried hard to spread lies on demonetisation among the people. On the day of Maha Shivratri, PM also invoked Lord Shiva. He said that people have a “third eye” like Lord Shiva to see the truth by themselves and not get swayed by lies. \nHere are some of the highlights of PM Modi’s speech: People sitting in Delhi will not understand what kind of wave is flowing across the state. People of the country have a third eye like Lord Shiva. With that eye, they find out what is truth and what is untrue. There is no dearth of people spreading lies. There is no dearth of people saying new lies every day. Any person would fear if he starts believing in those lies. But, even after that poorest people of the state finds out what is truth. Since I started taking hard steps against corruption and black money on November 8, some people are busy spreading lies against me and note ban. They don’t bother about the country but all they worry about is that even they couldn’t remain unaffected from demonetisation. Politicians who have been hit by note ban, have joined hands to fight against me. After note ban, both SP and BSP started talking alike, saying ‘This Modi is useless’. They tried hard to prove me wrong, but I bow to people of the country who have supported the truth and stood by it. Recently, there were elections in Odisha. People take the name of the state when they talk about poverty. In the state where BJP was not getting a chance to keep its flag even, people of the state gave such support to BJP that everyone was surprised. If even the poor people of Odisha can get along BJP, what will happen to other parties. You have seen what happened in Maharashtra. There is no sign of Congress. In all elections in the last three months, people used their “third eye” to see the truth, they voted for the BJP across the country. Be it Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, Karnataka or Rajasthan. With such kind of support, my responsibility has increased. I will make a task force of tech experts to find the modern method weighing sugarcane so that no one would be able to cheat farmers during weighing…Politicians and Sugar mills owners have a nexus. Akhilesh ji, your family prospered so much that you went to Australia for studying. But, what will happen to the poor people of Gonda. This is my concern. Akhilesh is anti-farmer. Why Samajwadi government has not taken Crop insurance policy? Akhilesh ji, your family prospered so much that you went to Australia for studying. But, what will happen to the poor people of Gonda. This is my concern. Akhilesh is anti-farmer. Why Samajwadi government has not taken Crop insurance policy? We will celebrate ‘Kesaria’ holi and make BJP government.In the first meeting of the new government, the first decision we will take is to waive loans of all farmers.
