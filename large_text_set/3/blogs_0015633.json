Worst food! As for the manager Moron ” along with a screenshot of the restaurant’s Google Maps profile.\nThe worst featuring! Worst food!

Disaster.”; “Absolutely awful! Worst restaurant in LA”; “This place is awful! Avoid at all costs!”; and last, but not least, “I give it 3 months.”\nFor more celebrity food and restaurant news, follow People Food on Facebook . \nDeeley’s server for the night discovered the tweets and fired back: “Cat, as your server at TomGeorge I am hurt by your response to free food. I gave you respect, and I served you with love.” His tweet also shows that a large portion of Deeley’s meal was comped and she failed to leave a tip.\n@catdeeley Cat, as your server at TomGeorge I am hurt by your response to free food.\nI gave you respect, and I served you with love. pic.twitter.com/Sil0RdOJh0 \n— J.

Respect and love should be shown to all, attention to detail is necessary too!, she wrote, adding: “And as I respectfully told you, the catalogue of errors were not your fault. However the mistakes were repeatedly not correctly rectified.”\nThe food was terrible and your manager was unhelpful and rude.
