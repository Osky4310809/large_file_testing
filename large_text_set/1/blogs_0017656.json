Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt is a few days after that trick, that flick, that goal and that performance and Tom Davies is still buzzing. \nEven the Reds are saluting him on Merseyside’s streets. \n“Everyone you see, even on the Liverpool side, is coming up and telling me how proud they are of me,” he said. \n“I don’t think I have come down yet. It was a great feeling walking off the pitch. I’m not sure I wanted to, I just wanted to stay out there.” \nThere is no chance, though, of Davies loitering too long on cloud nine after the euphoria of his goalscoring performance against Manchester City last Sunday. The Toffees youngster is keeping level headed (Photo: PA Wire) \nThroughout his stellar youth career, his trademark has been a level-head beneath tousled hair. \n“I have to prepare exactly the same for the next game but, if anything, this has made me want it more,” he said. \nSpeaking at the Everton Free School in the shadow of Goodison Park, Davies, 18, can sound like most well-programmed elite academy graduates but there is an individuality about him that has captured the imagination of Blues and beyond. \nHe said: “Maybe I’m not your average footballer, but that’s just who I am and what I’m like. \n“It’s just about being comfortable in your own skin, really, not being influenced by other people. \n“Just be good at what you do and be the person you want to be.” Davies says he isn't you average footballer (Photo: Getty) Read More \nDavies, a Beatles fan despite his youth, is trying to learn guitar – which is proving more of a struggle than playing Yaya Toure like a fiddle – and is a keen traveller. \nWith two Everton team-mates, Davies took himself off to Italy last summer. \n“I went there in the summer and I loved it there. I went with Kieran Dowell and Harry Charsley,” he recalled. \n“It was nice. A bit of culture. We started on the Amalfi coast, Capri, and then got the train to Rome. \n“We’ve seen the Pope, the Colosseum, then we went on to Lake Como and stayed in Bellagio for a few nights. \n“We just wanted to see the culture of Italy – it’s a part of the world I’d never been to – and we wanted to make the best of the time we had off.” \nNew experiences clearly count for a lot. Davies captained England at the under-17s World Cup in Chile in 2015 – a ‘great memory’ he insists despite a group-stage exit.

I hadn’t trained with Everton’s first team and these are the best England have got. \n“It was unusual but after the start of the session, I was fine with it and it felt natural. That gave me confidence.” \nThe big moment for Davies came when he was man of the match on his full debut against Norwich in the final game of last season. \n“It’s all about playing and that game against Norwich really showed me I can get there and just have to keep going,” he said. \n“The goal against City was great but I got man of the match against Norwich and I came away thinking, ‘I can actually do this’.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:00:13.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
