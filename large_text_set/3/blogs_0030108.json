Mar 28, 2017 4:51 PM \nDoesn’t matter. Jimmy Garoppolo is not for sale. dartmouthstevens says: Mar 28, 2017 4:52 PM \nAll things are negotiable. It is nice for him to say that, but “I will trade you this years draft and my 1, 2, 3 of next year” will get him to trade. If it doesn’t then my opinion of him would fall. lingsun54 says: Mar 28, 2017 4:53 PM \nThere’s no QB worth taking. Besides, teams often say one thing and do another on draft day. deneb1973 says: Mar 28, 2017 4:53 PM \nMakes sense – they’re the mighty Browns! They won’t trade even if they can get a superior to elite QB for the next dozen years. Keep looking in the mid rounds for the QB you haven’t been able to find since the team got back in the league. I guess they found the right coach in Jackson – take an elite pass rusher instead of a QB; trade 15 sacks for stability at the QB position. Cleveland logic – let’s play (money) ball! RogerThat! says: Mar 28, 2017 4:54 PM \nPlease. If Bill Belichick told you to trade him the #1 puck, you would do as you were told. Mar 28, 2017 4:57 PM \nlol what? wolverine is running the browns? dalvar1001 says: Mar 28, 2017 4:57 PM \nKirk thanks you. Colin thanks you for not thinking of him. v2787 says: Mar 28, 2017 4:58 PM \nJimmy Garoppolo is not for sale? Hogwash. Everyone is for sale. It’s just a matter of price. milehipigskin says: Mar 28, 2017 4:58 PM \nOh, Hue has been promoted to GM? Sorry Hue, you can cook the meal but you aren’t buying the groceries. Mar 28, 2017 5:01 PM \nAnd this surprises… anyone? The only QB’s that might conceivably be had by trade that could be considered (by some) worth trading for are a contract cost/control prohibitive Cousins and a Godfather offer might do it Garoppolo. For the Browns, who are more than just a QB away, neither is worth rolling the dice on a pick that can nail down a generational type pass rusher like Garrett. If Cleveland were in Houston’s win now position that might change things but if Cleveland were then they wouldn’t be picking first. patsxsaintsfan says: Mar 28, 2017 5:02 PM \nI don’t watch college so I don’t know for sure but from what I hear Myles Garrett is a stud so I would pick him up and use your 12th pick on a CB since joe Haden has been a shell of himself for 4 years and then next year AJ McCarren will be a FA and jimmy G unless he is tagged plus I hear next years draft class is stronger at QB. This team isn’t ready to compete for 3rd place in the division let alone the playoffs build the team until a QB comes to you don’t go looking for a QB. justintuckrule says: Mar 28, 2017 5:02 PM \nPoor Cleveland. Whichever QB they pass on is destined to be a hall of famer and if they trade for Garropolo, you know he’ll flop. \nThey might as well just resign Manziel. jjackwagon says: Mar 28, 2017 5:04 PM \nIt’s okay, Jimmy G is not worth a #1. babygaga19 says: Mar 28, 2017 5:04 PM \nBrowns, a few years ago Denver had the second pick in the draft and we’re desperate for a qb as first year GM Elway had decided Tebow wasn’t the answer. Denver took Von Miller and it worked out well. Go with the best athlete available. You have many needs. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
