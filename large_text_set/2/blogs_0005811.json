Hull/Swansea Marco Silva has breathed life into Hull's campaign (Photo: Andrew Powell) \nCredit to Marco Silva and Paul Clement for giving Hull and Swansea hope of staying up. \nPrior to their appointments most people had pretty much decided they are down and out. \nSilva was at Olympiakos and got ridiculed, especially by the Soccer Saturday panel who slagged him off as a nobody. He has done an exceptional job so far. \nFrom his Derby experience which didn’t go well, Paul Clement seems to have learnt what it takes to deal with individuals and the collective as a manager \nThere is still a long way to go and football is moveable but I am happy to eat a bit of humble pie on that one. Clement has learned from his struggles at Derby (Photo: PA) \nAfter Derby I didn’t think he had enough about him to come into a club and say I’m the No.1 guy. \nObviously if you’re coaching at Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern you must have something about you. \nBut I did question his ability in a players’ mind, to be able to take the step up to being the top man. \nBut so far, so good. And the masterstroke he has pulled off is bringing in Claude Makalele as his assistant, a guy who has the name, respect and recognition throughout the Premier League. \nI’ve still got a sneaky feeling one of them will still go down, most likely Hull, but both have a fighting chance. Colly wobbler Big Sam is struggling to turn Palace's season around (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nWhy is Big Sam Allardyce not getting a tune out of Crystal Palace? \nHe has got arguably the best squad in terms of talent that he has had to work with with the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Yohan Cabate and Christian Benteke. \nMaybe the tub-thumping, set-pieces, organisation and disciplined approach that he brings to a team is falling on death ears and the better talent he has to work with have decided ‘I am not doing this basic, formulaic stuff.’ \nI wonder if this is the time people say Allardyce is great at getting a bottom of the table side that he can mould into his own image to overachieve but when he starts to work with higher calibre players they are not prepared to listen to his message. \nYou only have to have two or three characters in the dressing room for that to be an issue. poll loading Will Crystal Palace go down? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:07:37.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
