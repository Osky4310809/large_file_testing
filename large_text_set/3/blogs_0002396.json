Tiffany Ferguson Photos: Pictures of Nashville Murder Victim Published Updated 5:56 pm EST, February 28, 2017 1 Comment By Paul Farrell 11k Share Tweet Follow A suspect is at-large after a 23-year-old nurse was brutally stabbed to death inside of her apartment. According to the Nashville Polie Department, Tiffany Ferguson was stabbed multiple times in the Wedgewood Park area of the city. She was discovered at around 6 a.m. after her roommate heard screams. When she went to check on Ferguson, the roommate saw the door was open. Authorities are searching for a man wearing a hoodie with ripped jeans. Police have said that surveillance video from the area shows the suspect attempting to get into cars that were parked close to where Ferguson was murdered. There were no signs of forced entry. After the suspect entered the apartment, some kind of confrontation occurred. The suspect also stole some things from her apartment. When she was discovered Ferguson was rushed to Vanderbilt University Medical Center where she was pronounced dead. A murder weapon was retrieved but investigators haven't said exactly what it was. Metro Police Spokesperson Don Aaron has described the death as a \"random act of violence.\" NBC Nashville reports that the apartment is in the Wedgwood Park condos complex close to Interstate 65. A neighbor, Mark McEntire, told the station, \"I hadn't heard anything about what had happened, and nothing has happened like this in the time that we've lived here, so it is a kind of new thing, but we'll hope for the best for everybody.\" Here are the photos that help to celebrate the life of Tiffany Ferguson, a life that was ended far too soon: Next Image: screen-shot-2017-02-28-at-5-44-53-pm Paul Farrell is an independent journalist and senior contributor to Heavy who covers breaking news and current events.
