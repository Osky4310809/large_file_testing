He campaigned against corruption and set up a regular payroll for the military. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “He came in talking tough on corruption,” Mr. Downie said. “And there was quite a lot of public demonstration of support for him. But there’s little evidence of any improvement made. The ultimate verdict is that his heart was in the right place; he went in and was immediately fed to the sharks.” The sharks in this case were the president and the speaker of Parliament, Sharif Hassan Sheik Adan, who in June settled a long and bitter fight for power by sacrificing Mr. Mohamed , who was allied with the president. “That was the downfall of Mohamed,” Mr. Mohamed said. “Temporary, I hope.” Photo Mr. Mohamed at his cubicle in Buffalo last month, working again for New York State government. Credit Doug Benz for The New York Times Government soldiers and civilians rioted in protest, saying Mr. Mohamed was the government’s only honest leader. He was replaced by his former deputy, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, who was an economics professor at Niagara University, near Buffalo. By June, Mr. Mohamed was back in Buffalo. “My job here was always something to fall back on if Somalia didn’t work out,” he said. Mr. Mohamed said he was enjoying not having to look over his shoulder for assassins and to be living at home with his wife and four children. Some critics have questioned Mr. Mohamed’s public stance against corruption, and an audit of the transitional government recommended forensic investigations of his office as well as of those of the president, speaker and other officials. A United Nations report in July called “endemic corruption of the leadership” in Somalia the “greatest impediment” to a working government. “If the argument is that he fought corruption, it’s either a smoke screen or he’s absurdly incompetent,” said J. Peter Pham, director of the Michael S. Ansari Africa Center at the Atlantic Council in Washington. “Corruption grew during his tenure as prime minister.” Mr. Mohamed said he tried to combat corruption from inside the government. “That’s why we won the hearts and minds of people,” he said. Some of the challenges in Somalia were the same as they are at the Transportation Department, he said. “When I’m here, I’m helping minorities,” he said. “And over there, it’s a different capacity and responsibility, but the purpose is the same.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But he said he hoped to return to Somalia, perhaps even to run for president. “It’s a mixed feeling to be here,” he said. “I believe I have some duty to go back one day and play some role. I don’t know what that role will be.” Janine Shepherd, who works in the next cubicle, said she was glad to have him back. “We were all surprised,” she said, “when he became prime minister: ‘What? Our Mohamed?’ ” When he came back, she said, they made him a cake. “We weren’t sure he’d return to D.O.T.,” she said, “because once you do something grand like that, to come back to this humble work is something else.” A version of this article appears in print on December 7, 2011, on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Back at Cubicle After a Break, To Run Somalia.
