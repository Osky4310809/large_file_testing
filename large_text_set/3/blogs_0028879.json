Real are ready to pursuit the Belgium international but has Zinedine Zidane worked out for to fit him into his starting XI? Share Hazard will be battling Bale, Ronaldo and Benzema for a starting place at Real (Photo: Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images) Share Get daily   Thank you for subscribing!   \nEden Hazard has been making Premier League defenders look foolish since he first took step in the league five years ago. \nBut how will he fit into a side already filled with with the likes of Gareth Bale , Karim Benzema , Toni Kroos , Luka Modric , James Rodriguez and Alvaro Morata and not forgetting the undroppable Cristiano Ronaldo . \nIt is a great potential headache to have for Zinedine Zidane . Hazard could be celebrating like this in a white shirt next season (Photo: Darren Walsh) Do Real really need him? \nIt has been three years since Madrid made a huge Galatico signing - when Rodriguez was signed up for Â£71m. \nTo win titles the giants do not necessarily need Hazard, but president Florentino Perez is up for reelection this year - and although he is very likely to hold onto his job, a big signing will make it easier. \nZidane has played a 4-3-3 formation for much of this season with a front line of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema all seemingly on rotation around the positions. \nMorata has struggled to break the incredible BBC but Hazard would have bigger clout to storm the trio who have been instrumental to Real's recent successes. \nFrance international Benzema tends to start at the tip of the trio, with Ronaldo and Bale providing width on either side. BBC might be broken up next season (Photo: Pedro Castillo/Real Madrid via Getty) Hazard's Role \nHazard is winger, maybe not a classic get to the byline and get in a cross for a burly striker type of striker, but a winger nonetheless. \nThe 26-year-old's flexibility and quick feet make him a good option down the middle, which is where he plays for the Blues. \nBut in a Real side with Ronaldo and Benzema down the middle and a settled midfield trio sitting deeper, Hazard might just have to get used to hugging the touch line and cutting in. \nHis moments of magic, like the wonder goal against Arsenal this season, make him tempting to sign before you add in the rest of his game. \nJose Mourinho learned at the Blues that Hazard needs to be kept happy - after his dreadful year last season before the Portuguese boss departed. \nTherefore Hazard will need the promise of a lot of minutes, unlike Rodriguez, before he signs on the dotted line, or else his form is likely to desert him again. Hazard can produce moments of magic (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nHere are three ways Hazard could fit in... Formation 1 - 4-3-3 \nIn this potential line up, Benzema misses out as Zidane gets to use his favoured 4-3-3 formation. \nThe XI would give the most stability with Hazard coming in and slotting in easily. \nThe Belgium would be expected to stick much wider than he is used to at Stamford Bridge but he would be allowed to drift inside switch with Ronaldo to cause havoc. Formation 2 - 4-3-1-2 \nThis scenario would let Hazard play in his favourite attacking role just behind the front men but would bleed natural width out the side. \nIt would require Carvajal and Marcelo to work over time to get back and forward, more so than currently. \nBut the benefits of having the front three all playing in their most potent position would terrify rivals. Formation 3 - 4-2-3-1 \nAnother potential lineup for Zidane would allow him to fit Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo and Hazard in one team - but at the expense of a midfielder. \nMorata would also be able to slot in instead of Benzema at times as well to give a bit of flexibility when there are enforced changes. \nAgain Hazard can manipulate play from behind the attackers with the possibility of interchange with the rest of his forward friends. \nThis is the most similar to what Hazard is used to at Chelsea, with Benzema filling in for Diego Costa and Willian and Pedro becoming Bale and Ronaldo. \nThe massive downside is the lack of Modric, Casemiro or Kroos, which provide an important attacking and defensive role in the heart of the team, but then again who cares with the amount of potential goals in this team. poll loading Do you think Eden Hazard would fit in at Real Madrid? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:12:21.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
