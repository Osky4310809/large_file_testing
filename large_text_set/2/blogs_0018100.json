These fans are part of an officially sanctioned supporter group,\" Roppolo said in a statement. \n\"The leadership of the FFA and the Wanderers need to send a strong message to these fans. They also need to prove they have zero tolerance for homophobic, discriminatory behaviour in sport. \n\"Just last week a UK Parliamentary Inquiry called for one-to-two year bans on fans who use homophobic slurs and said homophobic behaviour has been tolerated in football culture for too long.\" \nSydney Rangers have confirmed that they reached out to the leaders of the Red and Black Bloc on Wednesday morning and have offered to meet with them to explain why the banner is offensive and potentially very harmful to football fans dealing with their sexuality. \nWestern Sydney have until midday on Thursday to respond to the show-cause notice. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:46:28.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
