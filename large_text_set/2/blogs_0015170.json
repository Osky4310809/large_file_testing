Amid the rabble, Kaplan confirmed that he and his team have \"multiple new heroes being worked on right now\" before then, somewhat out of the blue, saying: \"24 is not who you think it is.\" \nWhile it had become more or less widely accepted the next and 24th Overwatch hero would be Doomfist, Kaplan's words suggest this may not be the case. Further down the thread, when asked why certain existing characters haven't received certain emotes, Kaplan added: \"We're always asking ourselves 'what would make the biggest impact for the most people' when we prioritise. Right now, we feel like introducing a new hero to the line-up would be more impactful to the game. Hope that makes sense.\" \nWhich begs the question: who is the next Overwatch hero? It may well turn out to be Doomfist as first thought, but that hasn't stopped the rumour mill from overloading nevertheless. \nSo, Overwatchers—let us know your own predictions, and why, in the comments south of here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:22:10.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
