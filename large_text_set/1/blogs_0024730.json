The first-choice youngster has started every single Premier League match so far; Begović has started every single EFL and FA Cup match. But that’s apparently not enough for Asmir — not a surprise, given his calibre. Over the past week, we’ve heard multiple stories of Chelsea looking for a potential replacement for Bego, but so far not having much luck.

Either way, Begović isn’t going anyway until a proper replacement can be found (sorry, Eduardo!). Conte confirmed all this in his post-match comments. \"The situation is very clear with Asmir.\" \"Asmir is a really important player for me, a really good goalkeeper, important in the changing room.
