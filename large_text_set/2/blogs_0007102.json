Watch | Government wins backing to trigger Article 50 by 494 to 122 00:42 Chris Graham 9 February 2017 • 1:40am \nB ritain took its latest step towards leaving the EU on Wednesday night , with MPs overwhelmingly backing Theresa May to formally begin Brexit in a historic House of Commons vote. \nThe European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was approved after around 40 hours of debate during which nine proposals to amend it were rejected by MPs. \nHaving cleared the House of Commons without any alterations with 494 votes to 122, the bill to pave the way for the formal Brexit process to begin under Article 50 of the EU treaties now passes to the House of Lords . \nH ere is what is expected to happen over the next couple of months as the Prime Minister attempts to keep her promise of formally launching the process of leaving the European Union by April . The House of Lords \nThe bill now passes to the House of Lords , where the stages - second reading, committee (when substantive amendments can be made) and third reading - are repeated. \nThe Government could find life more tricky in the upper chamber because it does not have a majority. \nLabour in the Lords has already said it will examine but not block the Government's Brexit plans, although some individual peers are likely to register their opposition. At a glance | What is Article 50? \nT he Liberal Democrats are determined to guarantee a fresh referendum on the final deal, protect single market membership and guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK. The party has 102 peers, compared with 253 Tories, out of a total 805. \nThe Bill is expected to complete its passage through the Lords by Tuesday March 7 but if peers have made amendments, it will return to the Commons, where MPs will debate whether to keep the changes or get rid of them. \nThis procedure, known as \"ping-pong\", would see the Bill repeatedly move between the Commons and the Lords until an agreement is reached on the final text. The timetable \nToday (February 9): Peers start to table amendments to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill \nFebruary 20 and February 21: Peers debate the Bill during its second reading in the House of Lords. MPs vote at end of debate. Peers expected to vote through legislation. \nFebruary 27: Peers debate the Bill in the first of two days in committee. Numerous attempts to amend the Bill are expected to be made and voted on by peers. \nMarch 1: Peers debate the Bill on the second of two days in committee. More amendments can be made and voted on by peers. Timeline | Key Brexit dates \nM arch 7: The Bill will then have its report stage and third reading on Tuesday March 7. If passed without amendments the Bill can receive royal assent. If not it goes back to the House of Commons for MPs to agree the changes \nMarch 8: Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, presents his Budget to the House of Commons \nMarch 9, 10: Theresa May, the Prime Minister, meets EU leaders at the European Council in Brussels when she could formally inform the EU of Britain’s intention to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and leave the EU. \nMarch 13, 14, 15: Government in the House of Commons attempts to overturn peers’ amendments in the House of Lords. Pressure on the Lords \nPing-pong seems the most likely stage for the Bill to be held up, as peers could become emboldened with time running out for the Government to hit its timetable of triggering Article 50 by April. \nBut members in both Houses will be acutely aware that appearing to frustrate the progress of the Bill would risk accusations that they are going against the will of the people expressed in last year's referendum. The fact the legislation passed through the Commons without being amended also weakens peers' hands. \nTim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said the party would continue fighting for a second referendum on the final Brexit deal in the Lords. \n\"Tonight's vote isn't the end of the process. Over the next few weeks, Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords will seek to make changes to the Government's plans,\" he said. \"It's a very dark day\" @timfarron reacts to likelihood of third reading of Brexit bill passing with no amendments https://t.co/Ny1WmUVjjI — Sky News Tonight (@SkyNewsTonight) February 8, 2017 \n\"Our goal will be to protect Britain's membership of the single market, protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK and to give the people the final say on Theresa May's deal.\" \nA government source warned the Lords it faces abolition if peers attempt to frustrate the progress of Brexit. \n\"The Lords will face an overwhelming public call to be abolished if they now try and frustrate this Bill - they must get on and deliver the will of the British people,\" the source said. \nThe Brexit Secretary, David Davis, urged the House of Lords to do its \"patriotic duty\" and pass legislation. \nAsked if the Lords would face \"dire recriminations\" if it amended the Bill, he told Sky News: \"I've seen these bloodcurdling things, they're silly. I mean, the simple thing is the Lords is a very important institution. \n\"I expect it to do its job and to do its patriotic duty and actually give us the right to go on and negotiate that new relationship (with the EU).\" The devolved nations \nScotland, whose voters rejected Brexit in the referendum, has been leading the charge against leaving the EU. \nThe SNP MPs voted against the Bill on Wednesday night, while MSPs rejected the triggering of Article 50 in a symbolic vote in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday. \nIn continuing talks with the UK government, the Scottish Government has put forward \"compromise proposals\" aimed at keeping the country in the single market when the UK leaves the European Union. \nMs Sturgeon has warned time is running out for Westminster and Holyrood to reach an agreement which could prevent a second Scottish independence referendum . How? You've just handed the Tories a blank cheque. You didn't win a single concession but still voted for the Bill. Pathetic. https://t.co/kDje2GLAey — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) February 8, 2017 \nT he views of the Scottish Government should be \"clearly reflected\" in the official letter that the UK Government sends to the EU to trigger Article 50, Holyrood's Brexit Minister, Mike Russell, said after the latest round of talks on Wednesday. \nMr Russell said there was still a lack of clarity from the UK Government. He said: \"Only last week the Prime Minister herself said that work to find a common UK position on triggering Article 50 needed to be intensified. . @AlexSalmond \"Last time UK Govt railroaded bill through parly like this was 1914. For this to happen on this bill is an outrage\" #Article50 pic.twitter.com/iuP25rF45e — The SNP (@theSNP) February 8, 2017 \n\"However, there was no commitment today that the Scottish Government's compromise plan to keep Scotland in the single market will be put forward as an objective by the UK Government. \nA fter Wednesday's vote, Plaid Cymru Brexit spokesman Jonathan Edwards criticised the Government for not listening to Welsh concerns. \n\"It is quite clear that Westminster does not represent Wales. Westminster has no intention of acting as a Parliament for four nations,\" he said. Issue still up for debate \nAlthough the amendments were voted down, the government has been keen to stress that debate on the issues is not over. \nOne proposed new clause, which had some Tory support, required the Government to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK before Article 50 is triggered. \nDavid Jones, Brexit minister, said the rights of EU nationals were a priority but the issue would be dealt with after the Brexit negotiations begin. FAQ | Brexit and EU nationals living in Britain \nH e told the Commons: \"I want to once again state to the House that the Government fully recognises the issue of EU nationals resident in the United Kingdom is an extremely important one and one which we wish to address as a matter of priority, just as we wish to address the issue of the rights of UK nationals resident in the EU. \"This however has got to be a matter that is addressed after the negotiations commence.\" \nHe said that was the case for the other proposals put forward. \n“These amendments are not for this bill, instead they are for the many future debates that will take place,” he told MPs. \n“Our intention, as set out in the white paper, is to leave the EU,” he said. “It would also be wrong to set unilateral demands before negotiations have even begun.” After Article 50 is invoked... \nLeaving the EU will not happen overnight but Theresa May has said she wants a deal to be hammered out by October 2018. \n“It could be as little as 18 months,” the prime minister told the House of Commons liaison committee on December 20. \nShe also wants the whole process done and dusted by March 2019, ahead of the 2019 European elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:56:42.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
