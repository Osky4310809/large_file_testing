Then there's another 10 percent that has a mix of those feelings.\"\nThe manager went on to tell Bleacher Report the majority of team owners \"genuinely hate him and can't stand what he did,\" and that only about a fifth considered Kaepernick, who began last season as a second-string quarterback and ended up starting 11 games for the 2-14 San Francisco 49ers, which he had taken to the Super Bowl just four years earlier. He became a free agent this year in a market with not a lot of good quarterbacks.\nKaepernick was not the only player to protest during the national anthem last year, but he was the first and by far the most prominent. Earlier this month, Kaepernick said he would stand for the anthem this year, arguing the method would detract from unspecified positive changes he believes are happening. He did not vote in November.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:04:21.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
