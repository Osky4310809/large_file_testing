(Photo: Getty) Share Get daily   Could   \nThirty years ago, a man hid 100,000 Canadian dollars in a TV . That's approximately £61,400. \nSomehow, the 68-year-old, who hasn't been named for privacy reasons, managed to forget that he'd stashed the cash inside the box. Quite how, we don't know. \nThree decades on, recycling plant workers have found the money stowed away in the back of the set. Employees at a factory in Barrie, Ontario, cracked open the broken television set and found huge stacks of bills . \nPolice say that the man has since been reunited with the money after tracing bank records from 1985. The money was found at a recycling plant (Photo: Getty) Read More Woman slices into Morrisons pepper – what she found inside was truly inspiring \n“This is a unique situation where this large quantity of money was missing without anyone knowing it was missing,” police officer Nicole Rodgers told the Ottawa Citizen . \n“He hadn’t even realised with the police officers sitting in his house that they were speaking of the cash box with his money in it. \n“In his mind, he thought it was still somewhere else in his house.” \nRodgers added: \"It wasn’t like he was hazardous with his money … he probably thought it was under the mattress.\" \nPlant operators at the Global Electric Electronic Processing (GEEP) plant in Barrie found the stash on January 13.

Apparently, there wasn't a requirement for the workers at the recycling station to hand it in. \nPolice said the man, who hails from a nearby village called Bolsover, was “relieved and ecstatic” over the finding. Understandable. Maybe he'll buy a new TV – flat screen, this time.
