Photo by Czeasar Dancel/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) â€“ Chris Ross exploded for a career-high 31 points and the San Miguel Beermen built a big enough lead to fend off TNT KaTropa, 97-86, to even   semifinals at 2-2 on Tuesday, February 14 at the Mall of Asia Arena. \nThe defending champions avoided a 3-1 deficit after losing back-to-back to TNT, which relied on its ample bench contribution to pull through. \nRoss made 5 of his 11 triple attempts and also pulled down 5 rebounds and dished out 5 assists. \nJune Mar Fajardo posted 15 points and 15 rebounds plus 4 blocks, as Alex Cabagnot dropped 12 markers. \nMarcio Lassiter had a double-double of 12 points and 10 assists on top of 6 rebounds, while Arwind Santos added 7 points and 8 rebounds. Gabby Espinas chipped in 10 markers. \nSan Miguel pulled away from a close game in the second quarter, outscoring TNT by 26-13 and eventually led by as much as 22 points. The KaTropa managed to slice the deficit to 9 in the payoff period but were not able to get over the hump. \nLarry Fonacier came off the bench for a team-high 15 points as Jayson Castro had 13 markers and 5 assists. Mo Tautuaa registered 12 points and 6 rebounds as TNT's bench continued to dominate, 44-20. \nThe KaTropa struggled with outside shooting, going 6-of-28 from deep. But capitalized on their time at the free throw line with 19-of-24 makes. TNT, on the other hand, was 8-of-12. \nGame 5 of this best-of-7 series is on Thursday, February 16. \nScores : SMB (97) : Ross 31, Fajardo 15, Lassiter 12, Cabagnot 12, Espinas 10, Garcia 8, Santos 7, Tubid 2, Y.
