Each one’s head is circled in red ink. \n“Who is this?” he tweeted, along with one of the photos. “On Monday he asked about the Women’s March on Washington and the March for Life.” \n“Who is this?” he said in the next tweet. “On Monday he asked about Trump’s relationship with the Hispanic community.” \n“Who is this?” he continued. “She asked a series of questions Monday about Trump’s relations with Latin America.” \nGertz tweeted out seven photos in all. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer has switched up the pecking order in the first few briefings, opting to give outlets such as The New York Post and Christian Broadcasting Network an opportunity to ask questions, in addition to the more traditionally favored networks and wires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T20:16:19.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
