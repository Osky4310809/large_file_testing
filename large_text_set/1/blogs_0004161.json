And it’s not so much about raising money and philanthropy… it’s more about keeping these guys cooperating, changing the culture.” \nThe woman then asks Biden where he will be based. \n“I’m going to be based out of Penn for foreign policy,” Biden said. “But I’m deliberately not associating with any one medical center.” \nBiden has yet to confirm his plans officially.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:06:48.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
