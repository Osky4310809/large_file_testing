As expected, Alisson will retain his place in goal. \nThere will be just two changes from the XI that took to the field for Tite’s first game in charge, against Ecuador in September 2016, and one of those is enforced with Man City's Gabriel Jesus nursing a toe injury. \nThe other will see Chelsea’s Willian replaced by Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho. Willian is the only player since Tite's arrival to have lost his place in the side due to anything other than injury or suspension. \nAssistant coach Sylvinho ran tactical drills with the first XI in Sao Paulo on Tuesday, which focused heavily on the movement of front-man Firmino. \nBrazil travel to Montevideo on Tuesday night and on Wednesday will train at the Estadio Centenario, where they meet Uruguay on Thursday.
