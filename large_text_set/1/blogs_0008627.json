And at the Golden Globes InStyle after party, her edgy look and overall slay-age had us totally thinking how much she has in common with her dearly departed father — and how proud he would be of the woman she’s become.\nAccording to People , Paris rocked a dress from Tadashi Shoji for her red carpet debut. Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic The gown featured an open back, lace insets, and a floral motif, straight from the brand’s Resort 2017 Collection. She paired the dress with a Helorocha gold chain mail clutch festooned with “dangly star and mood pendants,” and as always, proudly showed off her collection of tattoos. \nThe fierceness is real. Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic Her date for the night was Sofia Richie, because lady BFFs were the go-to “accessory” at the Globes. @sofiarichie ur hot \nA photo posted by Paris-Michael K. Jackson (@parisjackson) on Jan 9, 2017 at 2:34am PST \nJackson, who will turn 19 in April, has a huge year up ahead. She’ll soon appear in a family film called Lundon’s Bridge and the Three Keys , and has already had some modeling work appear in Flaunt . According to People , she’ll also adorn the covers of three major entertainment magazines in the next few months, and via her colorful Instagram account — where she recently posted photos of herself giving godfather Macauley Culkin a pedicure — we’re all getting the chance to witness her star rise right as it happens.\nWe can’t wait to see what she does next, and know that whatever it is, it would make the King of Pop beam with pride.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T00:53:16.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
