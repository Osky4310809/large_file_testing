The 27-year-old actress is opening up about her turbulent relationship with her father , famed singer-songwriter Phil Collins, in a beautiful and moving letter of forgiveness from her new book of personal essays , Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me .\n“I’ve realized that many of my deepest insecurities stem from t hese issues with my dad ,” she writes in the memoir. “It’s taken me over a decade to resolve some of them (others I’m still resolving) and to finally build up the courage to speak my mind to him.”\nHappy birthday dad! Thank you for inspiring me to tell stories, pursue my dreams, and live my life #Unfiltered. No matter how old I get, I'll always be your lil Lil and want to help you blow out your candles. Love you to the moon and back again... \nA post shared by Lily Collins (@lilyjcollins) on Jan 30, 2017 at 2:08pm PST \nThe Rule Don’t Apply actress and her father’s rocky relationship began around the time he and her mother divorced when she was just 5 years old, after which he moved from England to Switzerland. After moving to Los Angeles with her mother, Lily and her father’s relationship became all the more strained due to his absence and growing dependence on alcohol .\nDad is so hood. On our last night we decided to play dress-up. I was a cheerleader and he, a monk. Don't ask #goteamCollins #Jesusheknowshim #ohLord... \nA post shared by Lily Collins (@lilyjcollins) on Aug 10, 2015 at 10:04am PDT \n“Because my dad was often gone, I never wanted to do anything that would make him stay away even longer. I became extra careful about what I said and how I said it, afraid he’d think I was angry or didn’t love him. And the truth is, I was angry. I missed him and wanted him there.” \nAnd while she elaborates upon her painful truth in a touching and vulnerable manner, Lily certainly isn’t backing down or withholding anything.\nStanding up and using our voices is an incredibly important and powerful thing but not when we're focused on wrongfully accusing and verbally abusing others. My book #Unfiltered is not about the other people in my life but instead, what I’ve learned about myself along the way. It's not about vilifying anyone. It's about sharing my experiences to hopefully help others. In this book, I discuss a lot of sensitive issues including a physically abusive relationship I was in. Please don't speculate, jump to conclusions, target or blame anyone you think may have been involved. Cyber bullying or any other form of bullying is not a joke. It’s incredibly serious. It’s not healing or helpful. My intent in writing this book was not to point fingers. Please only spend your energy spreading positive and compassionate thoughts. Use your voices for good, for inspiration. Spread love only. Always and Forever, Lily... \nA post shared by Lily Collins (@lilyjcollins) on Mar 6, 2017 at 11:31am PST \n“We all make choices and, although I don’t excuse some of yours, at the end of the day we can’t rewrite the past. I’m learning how to accept your actions and vocalize how they made me feel…I now understand that my frustrations surrounding our communication are not about changing you, but accepting you as you are.” I know I've said it before but it's important you know: YOU guys inspired me so much to write #Unfiltered! Thanks @TheEllenShow for having me on to talk about my book, social media, and all the things we women face growing up... \nA post shared by Lily Collins (@lilyjcollins) on Mar 2, 2017 at 11:03am PST \nIn addressing her own issues and insecurities, Lily ultimately lays the foundation of forgiveness for her dad. She writes that she hopes this painful issue for herself and her father might help other girls heal their relationships with their fathers as well. And in closing, Lily invites her dad to get to know the amazing woman she is today as they begin to heal themselves. She’s optimistic, forgiving, and filled with ~so~ much love.\n“There’s still so much time to move forward. And I want to. I’m inviting you to join me. I’ll always be your little girl.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T03:59:58.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
