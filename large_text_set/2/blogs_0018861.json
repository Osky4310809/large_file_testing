Those people I am not sympathetic to, and I do not believe that you have to open your heart to them,\" Parry said, according to Fox News. \"People are going to die because of what happened.\"\nParry is also chair of the Catholic university's communications studies department.\nFox News personality Jesse Watters went to St. Joseph's University over the weekend to catch up with the professor as well as students who attend the school.\nMost of the students who Watters spoke to said they did not agree with Parry's remarks.\n\"I don't think it represents our school really,\" one student said. \"I think we are very open to all types of people. I don't think we're a community that closes their hearts to anyone.\"\n\"No longer is it real education taking place, it's just the teachers using their students and their lessons as a means to forward their political agenda,\" another student said.\nOne student said Parry should be spoken to by the school and that his comments do not reflect the values of St. Joseph's.\nWatters also caught up with Parry himself, who refused to speak with Fox News and tried multiple times to lose him.\nSt. Joseph's University did not return a request for comment to Fox News on Parry's comments.\nThe post Prof. Who Said ‘People Are Going to Die’ Because of Trump’s Victory Is Silent When Confronted by Fox News appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:42:08.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
