I’ve worked here for 37 years.” \nAnother road bump, the property is currently zoned RSA-5, which would allow the construction of about 44 single-family homes or row homes by right. Residents say that is what they expected and accepted could be built. \nHowever, Philadelphia City Councilman Curtis Jones Jr., who oversees this district, recently introduced an ordinance that would allow for residential mixed use, such as the proposed 100-unit apartment complex. \nJones is adamant that he is working with the community to explore options, including a remote lot complemented by van services, angled parking, and the potential expansion of mass transit. \n“That community center is a historic community center. It’s saved a lot of lives of youth in that community. Any negotiation that does not include North Light parking is dead on arrival,” Jones told Eyewitness News by phone on Monday. \nMany neighbors say they are frustrated by what they feel has been a lack of communication between Jones and the community. \nBright orange signs posted in windows make it clear — some Manayunk residents do not want the project to move forward as proposed. \nThey say it would exacerbate problems of overdevelopment, congestion and the lack of parking in the area. \n“Every nook and cranny is being filled up now,” Smith said. \n“Parking in Manayunk sucks,” added Poulita Soukhanthat, who works in the area. \nCommunity members are scheduled to meet with the developer at a meeting at the North Light Community Center on Wednesday, March 22 at 7 p.m. \nThe developer previously declined comment to Eyewitness News and did not respond to further requests.
