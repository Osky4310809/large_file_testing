His debut feature film ‘Tu Hai Mera Sunday’ was premiered last year at the London Film Festival. Dhaimade chats with Brand Equity about his journey from advertising to films. The years in advertising Dhaimade was supposed to follow the path of science and IIT, following the trope of a regular middle-class Maharashtrian upbringing, but along the way he got bitten by the bug of theatre which became the pathway to advertising and to films.He started out at Speer Communications and then moved to Everest where he worked for 10 years, followed by a stint at Leo Burnett, and then with ad-film maker Pradeep Sarkar before a comeback to Everest. Incidentally, at Everest both Dhaimade and his wife Rajul worked together. In 2005, Dhaimade decided to quit the full-time travails of an advertising job. Some of his most prolific work has been on Parle brands amongst others the famous Frooti-Digen Varma campaign. The ‘Tu Hai Mera Sunday’ story A fellow adman (Vinay Kanchan) was instrumental in seeding the idea of the Sunday football routine in the urban landscape and he got thinking what would happen if they could not play one Sunday. He took two years to flesh out the story.The maiden film, thus, is about a bunch of guys, living a suburban middle-class existence in Mumbai, connected by their common passion for football, till one day, something happens and the game has to be stopped. The film at one level is about the sport and the shared passion of its protagonists, at another level it is about space (urban) to personal spaces and finding happiness. The production house, Love & Faith, was launched in 2009. The two lives of ads and films Advertising has its own set of challenges and goals. Filmmaking is a completely different format and intent. In fact, being proficient in one does not automatically make someone proficient in the other. Each needs a different skill set and a different approach. Thinking of a campaign, while mulling on a digital breakthrough idea, while working on a new pitch: creative multi-tasking thus becomes second nature.Having said that, as the feature film comes close to making, it needs your complete attention, everything else fades away into the background. Though both have the same lineage, yet they are different crafts. From brands to branded content Dhazimade is currently working on a digital series that has “some interesting opportunities for branding, yet none of it compromises the story.” Also on the anvil are a few feature film ideas as well. He admits the business model of films is tedious, though. “You have to go through a certain maze so to speak to reach your audience, though a feature film can have the most amazing impact and lives on for posterity.” Advice to those thinking of switching “Make sure you know how the business works. Meet as many talented people as you can, in their crafts. Get a good business manager. A great accountant. Steal a good producer. And have a healthy bank balance.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T07:06:40.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
