Sly Stallone’s got 20 years on me and still looks good so he’s part of my inspiration.” \nAnd he revealed that he admires the action-film veteran.

You soak it up.” \nTalking about his fitness, the actor also revealed that he enjoys to practise Brazilian jiu-jitsu with Guy Ritchie.

He’s so good. He’s got every aspect of what he does down to a fine art. He’s got the ability and he’s so confident,\" Jason said. \n\"When it comes to the banter, the destruction of his opponent mentally, there’s no one better. I can’t get enough of him. I think he’s superb.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:24:38.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
