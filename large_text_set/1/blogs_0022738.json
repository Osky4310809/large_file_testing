Brown has thrived this season under the guidance of Rodgers Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has hailed the influence of Scott Brown as the captain prepares to make his 400th club appearance. \nBrown, 31, joined Celtic in 2007 and Rodgers believes he will remain a key figure for many more years. \n\"It's a remarkable achievement by a top class professional,\" Rodgers said ahead of Wednesday's home Premiership game against St Johnstone. \n\"My first impressions of him were very positive and he's a remarkable leader.\" \nOnly 26 players will have made more appearances for Celtic than Brown and Rodgers praised the Scotland midfielder for his inspirational qualities. \n\"To play the number of games at a club this size, your professionalism, your enthusiasm, your energy for the game and your commitment to being a top professional has to be there,\" he said. \n\"The players take a great lead from him, he's at the very front from the first steps we take onto the training field, the warm up, right from the very start he sets an incredible example, and his performance level. \n\"He's been at the top of his game this season. Four hundred would be great for him, but there's quite a few more to come as well.\" Landmark record in sight for Rodgers \nIf runaway league leaders Celtic avoid defeat against St Johnstone, it will be their 26th consecutive match unbeaten in domestic competitions this season. \nThat would see them equal the record set by the famous Lisbon Lions team in the 1966-67 campaign, a feat that Rodgers acknowledges would be significant. Brown lifted the League Cup in November, his 11th trophy success with Celtic \n\"To be talked in the same breath as those guys, who really created the legend of this club, would be a huge privilege,\" he said. \n\"I haven't really thought about it, to be honest, just really tried to look to win our games no mater the consequences of it. \n\"We have a lot of hard work to do, St Johnstone will be a tough test for us, particularly away from home they've done very well.\" One more signing on the horizon \nCeltic's only January signing so far, Kouassi Eboue, is training with the squad, having been granted his work visa. He remains a few weeks away from being considered for selection, according to Rodgers, who is hopeful of adding one more player before the end of the month. \n\"I didn't want to bring in too many but we have an option we would hope we could get over the line,\" he said. \n\"It's about slowly building the squad, to help the players who are already here. \n\"There might be one or two players who go out on loan. I suspect there will be some change in the squad before the end of the window.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T17:30:28.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
