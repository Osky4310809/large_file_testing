Rowling is no exception. On Wednesday evening, the author responded to a tweet from radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer with a message of resistance.\nHere's Hartley-Brewer's original tweet.\nONE man armed with just a car & knives can kill FOUR people & injure 20, many seriously, on our streets. This is the country we now live in.\n— Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) March 22, 2017\nAnd here's Rowling's response, which came later that night.\nA policeman died to protect parliamentary democracy. An MP fought to save his life. We grieve, we fight on. This is the country we live in. https://t.co/1YvxEJLvXN\n— J.K.
