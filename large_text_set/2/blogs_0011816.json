We decided to have the vet name you. She said, “Oliver, because you are an orphan.” And with a clean bill of health, you went home with us. \nEverything changed. You controlled our moves, our schedules, our lives. You’ve become everyone’s favorite, the baby of the family, whose funny antics captured the hearts of many. I love you, my dearest purring machine; you may have been baptized Oliver, but to me, you are my Olipurr, my kuting, my little superstar. Please don’t ever change. \nYours forever, \nA letter to Tasha Yuna (Shih Tzu) Dear Tasha Yuna, It’s been a year since you came into my life, when my world was so dark, I went into a depression after my failed relationship. You saw me suffer, you saw me cry and you saw me desperate, but you never left. You can’t talk, but you show you understand me by initiating cuddling whenever you see me crying. You lick my tears, you try to cheer me up, so now my motto in life is, “Aso na lang ang loyal.” Elouis, amixed breed princess celebrating her birthday soon \nLove,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:08:04.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
