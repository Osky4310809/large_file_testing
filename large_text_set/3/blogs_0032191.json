This criminal psychologist's answer to that question is terrifying Author Chris Carter studied psychology and criminal behaviour and has he interviewed and studied many criminals including serial and multiple murderers serving life, here he tells you how to spot one.

They don’t suffer seizures, blackouts, or lose track of reality due to their condition. In fact, they’re not only masters at appearing normal to everyone around them, they’re also experts at gaining people’s trust. Ted Bundy, serial killer, after he was imprisoned, circa 1978 (Photo: Rex) \nNow allow me explain why that is. \nA Psychopath’s main characteristic is what psychologists call “severe emotional detachment”, or SED for short. SED is one of the hardest “mental abnormalities” to diagnose - harder than schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis and even borderline personality disorder, but what does SED really mean? \nIn layman’s terms, “severe emotional detachment” simply means an inability to experience feelings such as love, sympathy, pity, affection, compassion, mercy, empathy, remorse, guilt and so on. \nPsychopaths literally do not feel emotions towards other human beings, but here’s the thing – they act like they do. So why would someone, totally lacking on sentiment, go to great lengths to mask that condition? The story of Steven Avery has captured audiences in Netflix's Making a Murderer (Photo: Collect Unknown) Read More Teens Who Kill: True story of boy who murdered two people because 'voices' in his head demanded 'sacrifice' \nThe answer to that question is also quite simple. \nPsychopaths do know right from wrong. They don’t have a warped concept of reality and they don’t live in a fantasy world inside their heads. Quite the opposite, actually. \nPsychopaths tend to be very grounded people. They realize that not feeling any emotions whatsoever towards other human beings would one - be considered wrong by society, and two – bring unwanted attention to them. \nWith that knowledge, they do what comes naturally to them - they fake their emotions so not to be cast aside by everyone around them. (Photo: 1991 ORION PICTURES CORPORATIO) \nThe truth is that psychopaths are pathological liars, who love to con and manipulate others. \nThe scary part of that truth is that they are usually very good at it and to catch them on one of those lies is a monstrous task. \nDuring my time as a criminal behavior psychologist in the USA, I interviewed hundreds of killers, many of them serial. Rarely did any of them seem out of the ordinary in any way. \nOn the contrary, I interviewed killers who were as charming, funny and charismatic as a chat show host. \nSome looked so scared and fragile, one would be forgiven for wanting to give them a hug and tell them that everything would be okay. A few of them looked like kind grandfathers, who you wouldn’t think twice about sitting down and having a cup of tea with. The TV show Dexter is all about a serial killer who hides in plain sight (Photo: Publicity Picture) \nAs scary as it sounds, the biggest common trait I found linking almost every psychopath I interviewed in my career, was the fact that they all looked and behaved as ordinarily as most people you would encounter in your everyday life. \nThey can be funny when they need to be. They can be understanding, friendly, helpful, sympathetic... whatever the situation calls for, and their acting will be Oscar worthy. Best selling crime author Chris Carter (Photo: Facebook/Chris Carter) \nWith all that said, I would like to add that though in the USA psychopaths make up thirty-five percent of violent offenders in prison, most psychopaths are not criminals. \nThey will go through life pretending that they care and that they do not have a complete lack of emotions towards their fellow human beings, but that isn’t a crime.

That means that in the UK alone there would be over one million of them walking the streets. \nThey could be your neighbour, the shopkeeper at your local corner shop, your teacher, the community worker that visits your house once a month, your mate down the pub, your boss, or even your spouse. They hold regular jobs and take part in regular everyday activities just like you and I. \nMost of them are able to hold down steady relationships and even get married without ever feeling any emotions towards their partners or kids. \n“How can that be?” you ask. The popularity of shows like Broadchurch indicate the appetite for crime stories is as strong as ever. (Photo: PA) Read More What makes a serial killer? Five types of killer personality from the charmer to the power junkie \nSimple again - they fake it, and because psychopaths don’t act or look any different from the person you see in the mirror everyday, identifying them by looks alone, or even through regular extensive conversations is almost impossible. \nAn American group of criminal and forensics psychologists, instructed by the FBI, have developed a few tests, mainly diagnostic checklists, designed to measure key personality characteristics that could reveal psychopathic traits, but even then there can be no guarantees because the tests are beatable. \nAn X-ray will show a physician the exact location of a fracture, or a tumor, or a variety of other ailments, allowing them to prescribe the correct treatment, but unfortunately the same isn’t true when it comes to mental illnesses.

You don’t. \nThe ugly truth is that you may be sitting next to one right now, you may be dating one, you may even me married to one, and you would never know. \nChris Carter is a criminal psychologist and current Sunday Times bestselling author - The Caller is currently in the Hardback Fiction Sunday Times bestseller list.
