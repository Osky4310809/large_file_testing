Here's how it looks now:\nThis PC build is being worked upon by the team behind CEMU, which is funded through Patreon. It's interesting to note the huge uptick in support this team has garnered over the two weeks since we last checked in.\nA fortnight ago CEMU was supported by 1857 people, who collectively donated $7782 per month (around £6300). It's now supported by 5135 people, who donate nearly $22k a month (more than £17k).\nNintendo has yet to comment publicly on the effort - although we've dropped the company a line should it wish to add anything here.\nIn general, Nintendo takes a dim view of unofficial emulators. In a FAQ on the official Nintendo website, the company calls emulators \"the greatest threat to date to the intellectual property rights of video game developers\", adding \"emulators developed to play illegally copied Nintendo software promote piracy\". Our own Chris Bratt investigated Nintendo's thorny relationship with emulators in the video, below.\nWhere the CEMU team previously estimated Zelda would take months to finish, it now appears like the game is ahead of schedule. We'll continue to keep an eye on how the project progresses.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR1uEwjx7VI"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:54:20.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
