By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 02/03/2017 \nNight Dive Studios has released a video showing an early look at the System Shock reboot. \nThe video, below, shows off Unreal Engine 4-powered pre-alpha footage of the reboot, due out in 2018 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. \nSystem Shock, developed by Looking Glass and released in 1994, is set aboard a space station in a cyberpunk vision of the year 2072. You play a nameless hacker who battles against a horrible artificial intelligence called SHODAN. \nSystem Shock was critically-acclaimed for its 3D engine and physics simulation, which went on to influence a raft of games. Looking Glass, with the help of Irrational Games, released a sequel in 1999.
