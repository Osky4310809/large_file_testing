And doesn't she know it. \n\"Well, I hope you’ll forgive me if I confirm that yes, I was very beautiful,\" the absolute legend told the Daily Mail back in 2013. \"Certainly, between the ages of 18 and 23 when I married for the first time, I seemed to attract the opposite sex.\" June Brown, back in the day (Photo: Rex Features) June Brown as Dot Cotton in EastEnders (Photo: Mirrorpix) \nJune, who turns 90 next month, also admitted she was quite into racy relations in her youth. \n\"Don't get me wrong.
