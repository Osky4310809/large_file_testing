Just kill them,” Verne responded to a tweet by Ann Coulter. “Or we can just put a bullet in their head immediately,” she added. \nHer Twitter has since gone private and the tweets deleted, but not before screenshots had been taken. \nVerne had worked at the school for 12 years as a third-grade teacher before resigning. \nThe school said they supported her freedom of expression, however, they felt the comments she made “have no place in our school.” \n“[Verne] deeply regrets having in recent days made comments using her personal social media account that were inappropriate, offensive and unbefitting of a Pardes teacher,” a statement from the school reads. \nWelcome to Trump’s America. \nLet’s see the free speech warriors defend this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:35:27.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
