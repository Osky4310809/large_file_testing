Maxine Waters (D-CA) will reportedly not attend his speech to a joint session of Congress tonight. \nWaters reportedly told House Democrats that she would not be able to control herself, so she's staying home. \n\"The president is not going to say what I want him to say,\" she said. \"He's gonna take credit for everything.\" Read Full Article \nWaters is not the only Democrat engaging in a form of anti-Trump protest tonight. \nRep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) is typically a fixture sitting along the aisle to shake the president's hand at the addresses. \nThough he has sat there every year since 1989, he will be breaking his streak among the so-called \"Aisle Hogs\" tonight. \nAnother Aisle Hog, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), also will be sitting elsewhere this evening after four straight years on the aisle during President Barack Obama's State of the Union addresses. \n\"Who knows? Maybe in a few years I'll have that kind of relationship with the sitting president.
