Commander Alvin Dagalea said. \nDagalea said a passing motorboat rescued some of the fishermen while others were found on a nearby island. \nTheir fishing boat, F/B NR, was riddled with bullet holes and sank, he said. \nPolice Chief Insp. Helen Galvez, spokesperson for the Zamboanga City Police Office (ZCPO), said the 15 were on a fishing trip from Sibugtoc Island when armed men on two speedboats approached and boarded their vessel and ordered them to go to the bow area. \nTwo of the survivors, Nomar Sakandal and Kervin Banahan, told police that the armed men suddenly opened fire.   \n“We managed to jump overboard and swim away but some of our companions were killed,” one of them said. \nThe bodies of the eight fishermen were retrieved, all of them hogtied with multiple gunshot wounds, indicating they were executed, police said. \nDagalea added the unidentified gunmen could be pirates, while a military report said the motives being looked into include extortion or a grudge between fishing groups. \nAbu Sayyaf militants are suspected of being behind a string of ship hijackings in the area, and last week, coast guard and navy units foiled an attempt by suspected Abu Sayyaf gunmen to hijack a cargo vessel in nearby Basilan province. – AP, Evelyn Macairan  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:21:52.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
