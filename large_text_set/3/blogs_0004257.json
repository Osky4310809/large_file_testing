PUBLISHED: 00:00, Thu, Mar 2, 2017 | UPDATED: 13:55, Thu, Mar 2, 2017 RSPCA Dying horses are becoming the saddest victims of a throw-away epidemic Scores of animals are being discarded on roadsides and dumped in remote lanes with thousands of tons of fetid rubbish. As the nation heaves under an epidemic of nearly a million fly-tipping incidents a year, the way that horses and ponies have become innocent victims of the scandal has shocked animal welfare campaigners. The Government today revealed there was a four per cent rise in fly-tipping incident to 936,090 cases last year, leaving councils in England with a £49.8 million clean up bill.

With horses exchanging hands for as little as £10 a time, unscrupulous owners are finding it easier to ditch a dead or sickly animal in the countryside rather than pay for the removal of a body or veterinary treatment. One of the worst hit areas is Kent where RSPCA inspectors have been called to dozens of heartbreaking scenes of dead and dying horses left in terrible conditions under fly-tipped debris. RSPCA Horses and ponies have become innocent victims of the scandal has shocked animal welfare campaigners I have been called out again and again to horses who are either already dead - or they are so neglected RSPCA Inspector Rosie Russon The charity says it has found 13 dead and 25 collapsed and dying horses in recent weeks, with six of the animals being in such a desperate state they had to be destroyed. Carers have been able to rescue and treat 19 animals. RSPCA Inspector Rosie Russon has witnessed distressing scenes and says the problem is not abating. Inspector Russon said: \"I have been called out again and again to horses who are either already dead - or they are so neglected and unwell it is just too late to save them. RSPCA RSPCA inspectors have been called to dozens of heartbreaking scenes of dead and dying horses \"The issue is particularly noticeable between November and spring because of winter-related problems like the lack of grazing, redworm and cold weather pushing animals, which are already ill, over the edge. \"These issues should be easily treatable, but instead of being given the care they need, the horses are just being neglected and then dumped to die.\" The charity has released a series of gruesome and tragic pictures of horses and ponies found dead and dying this year. GRAPHIC CONTENT: Worst cases of animal cruelty Mon, November 28, 2016 WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: As part of our new 'STOP THE CRUELTY' campaign we take a look at some of the most horrific cases animal cruelty. PA 1 of 32 Handout photo issued by the Orangutan Foundation of Aan, a critically-endangered orangutan who was blinded after being shot more than 100 times with an air rifle. Aan is to undergo an operation that could restore her sight. They include: • The bodies of two horses found dumped on Beech Road, Kingshill in West Malling, one, a year-old dark bay mare with white socks, was wrapped in a blue horse rug • A young piebald pony found collapsed and dying in Yalding and was so unwell could not be saved • The body of a horse dumped underneath a pile of planks in a field in Dartford and next to a can of petrol, presumably ready to be set on fire. Six horses were later recovered at the same location • The body of the dead pony dumped on a woodland path in Wateringbury, Maidstone Inspector Russon added: \"The incidents we know about are probably the tip of the iceberg, and there are probably an awful lot more cases of dead and dying horses which we aren't told about. \"This equine crisis is heartbreaking for us all. We do all we can to rescue animals when we can but often by the time we are called about them it is too late and the horses are already in far too poorly a state for us to be able to help them. \"We will always look into cases of animal welfare reported to us, and do all we can to protect the welfare of the animals involved, but we rely on the public to be our eyes and ears in these situations as we can only investigate when we have information and evidence about who may have dumped an animal.\" The RSPCA urges anyone who has any information about dumped and neglected horses to call its confidential hotline on 0300 1234 999.
