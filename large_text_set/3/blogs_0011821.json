An Irish Coast Guard helicopter (file photo) (Photo: Reuters) \nA major sea search was launched in an attempt to locate the aircraft. \nThe Irish Navy's LE Roisin was en route to join the search effort. \nAn Irish Coast Guard spokesperson said: \"At approximately 1am contact was lost with one of our SAR Helicopters. \n“A major sea search is ongoing off the county Mayo coast approximately six miles west of Blacksod. \n“SAR Helicopters from Sligo and Shannon are on scene along with the Air Corps Casa. Ballyglass and Achill all weather lifeboats (ALBs) are on scene along with five local fishing vessels.” An Irish Coast Guard helicopter (Photo: Irish Coast guard / Facebook) \nSpeaking on RTE, Fergus Sweeney said: “Last location was Blacksod lighthouse which is about 14 nautical miles off the coast. \n“By all accounts it should have been a routine mission. \n“The weather it was quite misty and wet and visibility wouldn’t have been that great.” \nMinister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross T.D. expressed deep concern over the helicopter's disappearance. \nHe said: \"As the search for the Dublin-based helicopter R116 is currently underway I would like to express my sincere support and sympathies for all those involved, particularly those family members who are awaiting news of their loved ones. \n\"This is an extremely difficult time for all concerned. As we await further information I would like to appeal for space to be given to the relevant professionals involved in the search operation to complete their work.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T10:08:51.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
