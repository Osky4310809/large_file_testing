According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport , the tight end \"will test free agency,\" with a departure from the Patriots being \"a real possibility.\" Bennett commented on his impending free agency shortly after Rapoport broke the news: Martellus Bennett @MartysaurusRex I haven't given free agency a ton of thought at this moment to be truly honest. I've been in MartyLand creating for @ImaginationAgcy 2/22/2017, 1:07:06 AM The Providence Journal 's Mark Daniels previously acknowledged Bennett was likely to gauge his worth in free agency, noting he \" liked being in Foxboro and playing for the Patriots, but it's clear that Bennett, who turns 30 on March 10, wants to get paid.\" Over the course of 16 games during his lone season with the Patriots, Bennett recorded 55 catches for 701 yards and a career-high seven touchdowns with Tom Brady slinging him the rock. As a result, Bennett appears primed to cash in. According to Spotrac.com , Bennett's projected market value clocks in around $6 million annually. However, it should be noted a deal paying out $6 million a season wouldn't put Bennett among the 15 highest-paid players at his position.   Jimmy Graham owns the top average salary among tight ends at $10 million, while Gronkowski clocks in at fifth among all players at the position with a bargain-bin payout of $9 million per year. Factor in Bennett's status as one of the better blockers at his position, and he should have plenty of leverage when it comes time to sit down at the negotiating table with teams in need of tight end upgrades.
