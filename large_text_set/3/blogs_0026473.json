Romo gets hurt by just rolling out of bed in the morning gocaps8 says: Mar 24, 2017 4:35 PM \nFox is horrible. They don’t even broadcast in full HD and have Joe Buck as their top play by play announcer. derekleblanc says: Mar 24, 2017 4:45 PM \nI think him and Kevin burkheart would usurpe buck and Aikman. \nBeings a pats fan I would love for him to replace simms but Jim Nantz would still be there. Lost all respect for both of them in 2015 when they took turns jerking off over Peyton manning thinking that he still had it in the playoffs but simms is dumber then a bag of hammers and Nantz did because his agent is also Mannings. I prayed every game last year that I got eagle and fours Mar 24, 2017 4:46 PM \nGlad to see they arent’t scared off by his age and injury history. Mar 24, 2017 4:46 PM \nRomo would be an ideal add to CBS. He would give us insightful dialogue. Mar 24, 2017 4:54 PM \nUnlike Simms, I’m sure Romo will have no problem saying Redskins. Yes……..I said the “R” word. Mar 24, 2017 5:01 PM \nThat list is completely invalid once you put any above Spero and Wilcox. \nWhen they are doing the game I’m watching I turn the volume off. They don’t more than a few plays without make a mistake on what team they are talking about or not understanding a rule and misleading people watching. It’s painful to listen to. schmitty2 says: Mar 24, 2017 5:01 PM \nFox already has a former Cowboy QB homer who shows complete bias when he is the analyst for their games. No need to add another one. karmathaitch says: Mar 24, 2017 5:02 PM \nThank you Redzone! Mar 24, 2017 5:02 PM \nSecond tier QB for high profile gig? tformation says: Mar 24, 2017 5:10 PM \nTake it, Tony. Call it a career. You’re not going to win the big one. Not with the Cowboys. Not with any team. Not in the cards. Sorry, man. \nThe sunset awaits. It’s a pretty one. A lucrative one. Full of commercials for insurance companies.
