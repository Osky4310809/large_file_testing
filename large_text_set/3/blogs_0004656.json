Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis is the moment David Haye's trainer Shane McGuigan appeared to PUNCH a fan after his fighter lost to Tony Bellew . \nTeam Haye were slowly walking back to the dressing room when McGuigan allegedly landed a blow over the barriers at the O2 Arena. It is understood his reaction may have been provoked by Bellew supporters gloating and abusing Haye over his defeat. \nMcGuigan, whose dad is former Irish WBA featherweight champion Barry McGuigan, prepared the Hayemaker for his fight on Saturday night. \nThe 28-year-old was busy during the battle as he was forced to strap his boxer's leg with tape - after he injured his Achilles heal in the fifth round.
