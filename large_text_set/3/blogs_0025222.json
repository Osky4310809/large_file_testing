Normy! What if they do something to Norman?!’ screams Kylie. Kris tries to calm Kylie (Photo: E!) Kris sends Corey round to the house (Photo: E!)

I’ll take care of it. Kylie, honey, everything is going to be okay.” \nAfter Kylie rings off, Kris speaks directly to Corey, who is still a few minutes away from the house. She tells him it’s easier if she pops round to Kylie’s house as she’s closer, but Corey won’t let her.

Let me deal with it,” says Corey. \n“Listen, she is safe. She is not home. It will be issues with the alarm system, but just in case it’s not, you stay at home safely because I'm the one that knows how to defend myself. \n“You do not, so let me handle it.\" \nBut an agitated Kris tells Corey he doesn’t understand as it’s not his child, warning if he doesn’t get to the house within the next four minutes then she’ll go herself. \nCorey says Kris isn’t thinking logically and needs to chill out, but she fires back: “Don't tell me to chill out! You can't tell somebody when they're having a panic attack to chill out!\" Kris sent boyfriend Corey Gamble to check out the alert (Photo: FameFlynet) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T17:06:59.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
