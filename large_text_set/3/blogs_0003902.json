Winger Joe Lolley cut inside and embarked on a surging run, feeding the ball to fellow midfielder Philip Billing.

With fellow defender Nicolas Otamendi playing Bunn onside, the midfielder was left through on goal. \nBunn seemed to take an eternity to shoot, which made Bravo's gaffe even more unforgivable, as the Terriers took a shock early lead. \nIt was a sweet moment for Bunn, who endured five loan spells at different clubs – as well as a year out through injury - before being released by City in 2014 and joining Huddersfield. \nCity responded swiftly, Kevin De Bruyne testing Joel Coleman with a dipping free-kick, while Guardiola's side also had two legitimate penalty appeals turned down in quick succession.

In the same move, Raheem Sterling bamboozled Huddersfield's defenders with his quick feet, before squaring for Sane to steer the ball in from close-range for the equaliser. \nCity were ahead five minutes later, earning a penalty at the fourth time of asking, when defender Nicolas Otamendi was bundled to the ground by Stankovic, whose luck finally ran out when Tierney pointed to the spot. \nSergio Aguero stepped up to take the spot-kick and coolly dispatched it beyond Coleman to give Guardiola's side the lead. Aguero should have made it 3-1 two minutes later, hitting a post after finding himself through on goal.

Huddersfield were in meltdown, the buoyancy following their early goal replaced by panic and total disarray at the back. \nAguero claimed his second of the night in the 73rd minute to make it 4-1 and take his tally to 22 for the season, before sub Kelechi Iheanacho added a fifth late on. \nAfter a shaky start, courtesy of Bravo, City have a quarter-final meeting at Middlesbrough a week on Saturday. \nExpect Caballero between the posts for that one. poll loading Will Manchester City win the FA Cup this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:36:55.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
