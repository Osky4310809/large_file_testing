He was captured on surveillance footage lingering in the hallway directly outside Swift’s penthouse apartment door and on the building’s roof from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m, court papers charge.\nAnother time, Jaffar allegedly rang Swift’s door buzzer for an hour straight in a desperate attempt to make her acquaintance.\nUndeterred, he returned the next day and rang the doorbell for 45 more minutes, the complaint states.\nIn addition to the in-person approaches, Jaffar bombarded Swift’s management company with 59 calls between Jan. 27 and Feb. 16 demanding that he be put in touch with her, papers state.\nJaffar was busted March 6 on stalking and burglary raps and is being held on $20,000 bond. Judge David Frey signed off on an order of protection against Jaffar, barring any contact with the pop star.\nSwift bought the lavish, 10,000-square-foot penthouse for $20 million in 2014, property records show. Her star-studded neighbors in the 10-unit building include Orlando Bloom and director Steven Soderbergh, according to StreetEasy.\nJaffar’s lawyer, Liz Beal of the Legal Aid Society, declined to comment. Swift’s publicist didn’t immediately return a request for comment.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:28:07.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
