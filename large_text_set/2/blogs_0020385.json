I would probably have liked one by now,” said Arnold. “I haven’t heard from them for four days so I don’t want one now. At the end of the day I would have hoped I would have got an apology, but I didn’t get one. That’s life and we just move on.” \nTsatsimas said it was up to the fans responsible to apologise. \n“We encourage those who do feel remorse and have taken that banner and contributed to it to certainly come forward and express that,” said Tsatsimas. \n“In terms of us, do we want that in our game? No. We don’t resile from that, but having said that, we move on.” \nArnold said he had been called worse and “been through tougher times.” \n“I’ve got a thick skin and I’ve been in this game for 30-odd years,” Arnold said. \n“But I think it’s completely inappropriate for my children, my family. On top of that, all those young kids that turned up to the game with their parents to watch the game. I don’t think it has any place in Australian sport. Graham Arnold.
