Dion played really well tonight and Josh battled mercifully through the middle — his body use was first class and he smashed packs. \n“Sometimes one player is going to get the benefit of others’ good work. That’s not to say Dusty doesn’t do a lot of good work as well, but we’re happy with that.” Dustin Martin in action during the win over Carlton. (AAP Image/Julian Smith) Source: AAP \nOf course, Martin was aptly aided — as Hardwick said — by arguably the trade period’s two most shrewd recruits. \nPrestia, prized from Gold Coast, won 28 disposals to go with six clearances and a goal. \nCaddy, who arrived via Geelong, had 16 touches and also went forward to impact on the scoreboard. \nIt allowed Martin more time to stream up the field from a position on the half forward flank — something he was hardly able to do throughout a 2016 season where he won more footy than ever, but hurt opposition teams less. \nIn fact, last season was the first campaign in five years in which the midfielder didn’t average more than a goal per game. \nMartin finds himself out of contract at season’s end and headed into the year as one of the competition’s most sought-after free agents. \nPerformances like the one he produced on Thursday night will surely only increase his value — which many believe is already worth in excess of $1 million per season. \nBut, rather than become bogged down in free agency speculation — a trap many quality footballers have fallen into in the past — Hardwick praised Martin’s ability to focus purely on his football. \n“That’s what good players do,” Hardwick said. \n“He’s the ultimate professional. He goes about his business, trains incredibly hard and looks after himself. \n“He got the result he deserved tonight.” \nRichmond already has the most recent winner of a Brownlow Medal on its list. \nIt might also have the next winner as well.
