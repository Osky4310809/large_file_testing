President Dalia Grybauskaitė in Klaipėda © LRPK / Robertas Dačkus \nPublished on Thursday, the list emphasizes Grybauskaitė's determined position towards Russia. \n\"She's not called the Baltic states' 'Iron Lady' for nothing. Grybauskaitė, who in 2009 became Lithuania's first woman president, began urging action against (Russian President) Vladimir Putin 's breaking of international law before Russia annexed Crimea or launched its 'influence campaign' in the US election,\" Fortune said. \n\"Grybauskaitė's frank, insistent style sets her apart (particularly among her mealymouthed EU peers), and as the 28-nation bloc ponders a resurgent Russia, she's not holding back in her calls for a strong NATO and a united European front,\" said the magazine.

Other politicians include US Republican politicians John McCain and John Kasich, former vice-president Democrat Joe Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
