Eisenhower, said he thought about suicide when he found out Trump gave him the boot.\nWe're happy to report ... Charlie's bouncing back, and will have a new gig on the big day. It's not as prestigious as being the official guy -- he calls it being a \"make-believe\" announcer -- but it pays.  \nCharlie says he knows why Trump's tapped MLB announcer  Steve Ray  instead of him, and he thinks it smacks of political payback.\nBottom line: no  Vin Scully-esque send-off  for Charlie, but he's still got a job!\nGod knows it's hard out there for octogenarians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T11:07:39.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
