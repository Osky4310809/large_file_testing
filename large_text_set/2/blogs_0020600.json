Explore Mehrangarh Fort \nImpregnable Mehrangarh Fort, which rises above the city, is one of the largest forts in India.

One of the highlights is the museum, which houses an outstanding collection of fine and applied arts from the Mughal period of Indian history. It even has the only professional museum shop in India. The Fort's ramparts are lined with antique artillery and offer a panoramic view of the \"Blue City\". Do allow plenty of time to visit the Fort -- you can spend hours wandering through it. Want a romantic evening dinner? The Chokelao Mahal Terrace restaurant serves traditional Rajasthani cuisine, while the city sparkles below. The Fort is also an evocative setting for music festivals.

Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park 4. Wander Through Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park \nThe Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park was developed in 2006, with the aim of restoring the natural ecology of a large rocky wasteland area next to the Fort. Neglected for many years, it was overrun by an invasive thorny shrub. After the shrub was eradicated, over 80 native species of rock-loving plants from the Thar desert were grown there. The Park extends across 70 hectares (around 200 acres) of rehabilitated land and has a walking trail. It's interesting to explore at different times of the year, as its foliage changes with the seasons. Location: At the foot of Mehrangarh Fort.

Check Out the Clock Tower and Old City Markets \nA trip to Jodhpur wouldn't be complete without visiting the bustling Old City (many people choose to stay in it as well, as some of the best budget hotels in Jodhpur are located there and have fabulous Fort views). The Old City's famous landmark, the clock tower, stands at the heart of it -- and it's still working! Next to it, Sadar Market retains a traditional village bazaar feel. It's chaotic and colorful, and sells almost everything (including handicrafts, spices, saris and fabric). If you feel uncomfortable in crowds, you might prefer to take a walking tour rather than explore the market area yourself, as the congestion can be overwhelming. Brian A. Vikander/Getty Images 6. Marvel at Umaid Bhawan Palace \nThe magnificent Umaid Bhawan Palace, completed in 1944, was one of the last great palaces to be built in India. The royal family of Jodhpur still occupies a section of it. Most of the remainder has been converted into a luxurious palace hotel and unfortunately, it's off-limits to anyone who's not staying there. If you can't afford $600+ per night for a room, you can still get a glimpse inside the palace by having an expensive dinner at one of its restaurants or visiting the museum. The museum mostly displays old photos of the Maharaja and his family. There's a vintage watch and car collection as well. If you're into that kind of thing, it's worthwhile going there. Otherwise, you may be disappointed as you'll get to see very little of the palace. Location: Airport Road, Jodhpur. Entry Cost: Museum entry fee is 50 rupees (free for hotel guests). Camera fee 30 rupees.
