You can check out the Wish Upon trailer below, along with the poster in our gallery! \nRELATED: The First Wish Upon Trailer is Here \nTwelve years after discovering her mother’s suicide, 17-year-old Clare Shannon (Joey King) is bullied in high school, embarrassed by her manic, hoarder father Jonathan ( Ryan Phillippe ) and ignored by her longtime crush. All that changes when her father comes home with an old music box whose inscription promises to grant its owner seven wishes. While Clare is initially skeptical of this magic box, she can’t help but be seduced by its dark powers, and is thrilled as her life radically improves with each wish. Clare finally has the life she’s always wanted and everything seems perfect – until the people closest to her begin dying in violent and elaborate ways after each wish. Clare realizes that she must get rid of the box, but finds herself unable and unwilling to part with her new-and-improved life – leading her down a dark and dangerous path. \nDirected by John R. Leonetti ( Annabelle ) and produced by Sherryl Clark ( Cloverfield ), Wish Upon stars King, Ryan Phillippe, Ki Hong Lee, Mitchell Slaggert, Shannon Purser , Sydney Park, Kevin Hanchard and Sherilyn Fenn . The film is written by Barbara Marshall ( Viral ). \nWhat do you think of the new Wish Upon trailer? Will you check out the horror offering when it opens in theaters this summer?
