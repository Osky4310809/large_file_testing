The despairing attempt of Brighton defender Fikayo Tomori to head the ball off the line was in vain. If you missed it Diame did this madness for Newcastle last night. Wasn't even looking at the goal. pic.twitter.com/L6GehaiP3i \nDiame himself was quick to admit on Twitter that he perhaps didn't mean the shot. I definitely meant that���� - Mohamed Diame (@MohamedDiame17) February 28, 2017 \nBut it would get worse for Brighton, as Ayoze Perez popped up with an 89th-minute winner to send Newcastle back above their hosts to the top of the table. \n\"Was it a sickener? Yes, and I don't think it was a result we deserved,\" Brighton boss Chris Hughton said. \nFair to say there'll be a little less pressure on Newcastle at Huddersfield now. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:25:35.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
