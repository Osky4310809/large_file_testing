Lest Putin let such a fine compliment go to his head, Trump quickly followed up this declaration — “I do respect him” — by saying, “Well, I respect a lot of people.” Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States: He respects Putin, but thinks civil rights hero John Lewis is “ all talk and no action .” Trump went on to say that it would be “better to get along with Russia than not,” and that “if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world — that’s a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea.” O’Reilly said, “Putin’s a killer,” to which Trump replied, “There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers. What do you think — our country’s so innocent?” Well, looks like someone’s been watching The Americans. The Putin regime has been connected to the assassination of both opposition leaders and Russian journalists. Vice President Mike Pence did his best damage control on Meet the Press , explaining away Trump’s comments by saying, “What you have in President Trump is someone who is not going to look in the rearview mirror.” Pence also said that he doesn’t view Trump’s comments about Putin and the U.S. both being nations that kill people as a moral equivalency. Then again, Mike Pence doesn’t view cigarettes as a danger to one’s health; the man once wrote that “despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill.” He also doesn’t view evolution as a totally valid theory; he’s advocated the teaching of creationism in schools . Trump may not recall this, what with his tendency to avoid looking in the rearview mirror, but his disconcerting infatuation with — and easy forgiveness of — Putin is nothing new. As the Washington Post noted, this isn’t the first time Trump has shrugged off Putin’s extrajudicial killings by insisting Russia is really not so different from America, re: murder, morality. In an interview on Morning Joe in 2015, host Joe Scarborough brought up the fact that Putin “kills journalists that don’t agree with him” and “political opponents.” Trump brushed that off by saying, “Well, I think our country does plenty of killing too.” Traditional Russian wooden dolls called Matryoshka depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, hours before Donald Trump is to be sworn in as president of the United States, are displayed for sale at a street souvenir shop in St. Petersburg, Russia, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017.

In the same interview, Trump said that Putin is “running his country, and at least he’s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.” “I’ve always felt fine about Putin,” Trump pointed out. So, points for consistency? “He’s a strong leader. He’s a powerful leader.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T17:53:55.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
