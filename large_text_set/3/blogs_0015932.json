In the exclusive Dancing With the Stars sneak preview, Kym Herjavec (née Johnson) meets her partner for the first time when Mr. T literally comes crashing into the room. \n\"Sorry for that entrance there,\" Mr. T, 64, says. Never apologize for a dramatic entrance, Mr. T! \nKym doesn't miss a beat with The A-Team veteran. \"Hey, can I say, ‘I pity the fool'?\" Kym asks. Photos \n\"See, if you do it kind of funny, they won't believe you,\" Mr. T advises. But he doesn't want her to say his iconic line, that's his job, instead Mr. T says he wants Kym to be \"sweet.\" \n\"You're the beauty, I'm the beast,\" he says. \"I do the rough stuff.\" \nMr. T is in good hands. Kym has won the competition twice, first with Donny Osmond in season nine and again with Hines Ward in season 12. \nMr. T is just one of 12 contestants competing in Dancing With the Stars season 24.
