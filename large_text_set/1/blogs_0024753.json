At that time, what was then called Google Apps for Work was being used by 2 million paying businesses . \nPichai attributed G Suite’s success — especially with enterprise customers — to Google’s ability to provide its users with a highly secure platform. He also noted that Google continues to focus on expanding the partner ecosystem around G Suite (as well as the Google Cloud Platform). “Our customers and partners are appreciating Google Cloud’s dramatically accelerated pace of product rollout as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations,” he added. \nIt’s no secret that Google is currently heavily focussed on getting more enterprises to adopt its tools and services. This includes both its G Suite productivity tools as well as its cloud computing platform. At its Horizon event last September, the company combined all of its cloud infrastructure and productivity tools under the Google Cloud moniker. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T00:43:54.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
