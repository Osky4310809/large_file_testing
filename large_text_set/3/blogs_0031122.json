For someone who publicly shuns receiving personal gifts, President Duterte is also as transparent as he can be in declaring having accepted the offer of China to build two bridges across Pasig River that could help ease perennial traffic congestion in Metro Manila. \nDuring his extemporaneous speech at the Kaamulan Festival in Malaybalay City in Bukidnon last Saturday, President Duterte disclosed about the offer of China to build two bridges across Pasig River. The Chief Executive recalled this was part of the $24-billion investment package he signed with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his state visit in Beijing in October last year. \nTaking note on the renewed warmth and vigor of the bilateral relations between the two countries, President Duterte acknowledged the offered “gifts” in the presence of Chinese ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua. \n“China has promised us, for all their goodness… to build two bridges over Pasig River, free, gratis, and I bow in gratitude” Duterte told the crowd. \nSince the construction of the two bridges would be “gratis,” or at no cost to the Philippine government, therefore this could be considered as “gifts.” However, since it would not be for personal benefits, it should not fall under the acts prohibited in the anti-graft and corruption laws. \nDays before he celebrated his 72nd birthday yesterday, President Duterte reiterated his policy against receiving any personal gifts, a policy he has kept since he was still mayor of Davao City. Now as President of the country, he revealed, he has turned down personal “gifts” given to him one after the other.   \nEarlier, the President said he was given a very expensive Germany-made Mercedez Benz car. He supposedly tried to return it to the gift-giver, citing he could not possibly accept it even if he will use it for official use as President of the country. Pressed to identify who gave him the vehicle, the President told reporters in jest it was a “former girlfriend” of his. Perhaps, it came from his former wife, a half-German, Elizabeth Zimmerman? She is the mother of his three children to her, namely, Davao City Mayor Sarah Duterte-Carpio, Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte and Sebastian. \nSince the gift-giver allegedly refused to get it back, the President said he sent the luxury vehicle to the parking lot of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) where it is awaiting for public auction. “I did not accept. I just placed it there. To the taxpayers who are interested, they can buy it from the government. I will sell it,” he cited. \nOf course, it would be safe to assume the Mercedez Benz would not only be top-of-the-line model but presumably a bullet and bomb-proofed vehicle fit to secure the President on board. So it should pick a good price for interested buyers. \nBut we have yet to read any published notice for auction of this car. \nWhile he maybe a President already, he averred he is contented with the 1988 pickup he has been using since he was mayor of Davao City. Naturally, the PSG would not allow him to drive it. \nLast week, speaking before Filipino-Chinese businessmen’s groups, President Duterte told them someone attempted anew to gift him. The latest one purportedly is a gold Rolex watch allegedly being given to him as a “birthday” gift. Again, the President said he refused to accept the gift nor to mention the supposed gift-giver. \n“Well, I will sell it again to the — at a discount…Now who would believe me if I talk about corruption then I wear a Rolex? You think I can afford a Rolex?” the President posed this rhetorical question to his audience. \nActually, Malacanang Palace has an official repository of both official and personal gifts given to the Presidents of the country. \nIt is called the Goldenberg House located a few blocks away from the Palace along J.P.Laurel St. in San Miguel, Manila. Therefore, President Duterte could just deposit such “gifts” and other mementos given him as part of State collections stored at the Goldenberg House. \nHow can he maintain his moral ascendancy in his drive against corruption if he accepts such personal gifts, President Duterte argued. He took the occasion to renew his calls to the private business sector to cooperate and help his administration to stop corruption in the government. In so many words, the President impressed upon the Chinoy business community that corruption is a two-way street between the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker. \n“You have to stop corruption, do not give them anything,” President Duterte urged his audience during the convention of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Inc.(FCCCII) in Pasay City last week. \n“Whether you have money or you have none, I do not accept gifts,” he told them. \n“That’s why I’ve been complaining also of my salary. That is really what happens if you have two wives,” the President wisecracked, drawing laughter from his audience. Among those in the audience were the Chinese ambassador and the country’s biggest taipans led by Lucio Tan. \nEarlier last Friday a few hours before his speech at the FFCCII, President Duterte also addressed the commencement exercise of this year’s batch of the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA). Digressing from his prepared speech, the President joked about the notoriety of some policemen who get into extra-marital affairs that cause some of them to commit corruption in order to support more than one family. \n“Eh mayor ng Davao tatlo lang. Kayo apat. Anong klase? Nagkukompetensiya kayo eh,” the President ribbed them. (The mayor of Davao has only three (wives) but you have four. Are you in competition?) Now, it’s really confusing. \nNonetheless, the Chinese ambassador is obviously not confused when he presented last Monday in Davao City a family portrait painting of President Duterte with Cielito “Honeylet” Avanceña and their daughter Veronica whom the couple fondly calls Kitty. \nOfficial photos released by Malacañang showed amb. Zhao also gave President Duterte a painting of a rooster. This is because the President was born under the Chinese zodiac sign on March 28,1945 which like 2017 was also a Year of the Rooster. \nMore than the two paintings, the two bridges that China promised to President Duterte to rise in Pasig River would be the better gifts if given without any strings attached.
