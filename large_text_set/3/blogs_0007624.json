Hoping things stay the way the are, or they way they always have been, is a sure recipe for disappointment. Yet Google has to reiterate time and again that changes occur on a near-daily basis. \nGoogle’s Gary Illyes expressed similar sentiments in a tweet stating, “we have 3 updates a day in average. I think it’s pretty safe to assume there was one recently…” \nIllyes also broached the subject with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor stating all updates will be named “Fred”, unless stated otherwise. Here’s hoping the SEO industry doesn’t take that too seriously by naming updates Fred V1.0, Fred V2.0, and so on. \nSo, yes, there was probably an update yesterday. Maybe even 3 updates. Those who have done their due diligence believe the changes from yesterday’s update(s) are likely the result of low quality inbound links. \nIf that’s the case, Google’s recommended course of action is to attempt to get the links removed naturally. If that fails, or if the number of low quality inbound links is too large to get each one removed individually, then next recommended step is to look into disavowing backlinks .
