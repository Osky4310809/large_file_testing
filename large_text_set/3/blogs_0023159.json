Dele Alli has become the heartbeat of Tottenham's team (Photo: Bongarts/Getty) \nToday it is very clear to see exactly what Ali has in his locker: his ability to score goals, his athleticism, heading ability, and his link up play with Harry Kane to name but a few. \nBut what made him stand-out back in the day, and why was former Spurs boss David Pleat so adamant that the north London side should sign him? \nWell, according to the man himself, who spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live, there were a number of things that caught his eye, as to be expected. The youngster's talent was spotted by David Pleat (Photo: REUTERS) \nBut one thing in particular really helped make Alli stand out from the rest of the pack. \n\"He was very athletic, and he can run from box to box comfortably, he has got a nice stride, unselfish, decent in the air,\" said Pleat. \n\"He was more of a holding midfielder, even though he got quite forward. Pleat was Tottenham manager in 2004 (Photo: Reuters) \n\"I saw him away from home in a couple of games and his attitude amongst more senior players, he was like an old head on young shoulders. \n\"It was strange really for a boy of that age, he was 17, 18, and the most important thing is the manager is really good at Tottenham. Pleat praised the way Mauricio Pochettino has handled Alli (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"He has immediately put him into the senior squad, which some managers would have been reluctant to do. \n\"Some of these boys need to go in straight away, because they can cope with it and Dele Alli has proved he can cope with it, and he has been a tremendous signing.\" poll loading Is Dele Alli a future England captain? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T23:24:15.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
