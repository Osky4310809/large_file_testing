The team has said that a decision hasn’t been made. A respected member of the media contingent covering the team says a factor unrelated to quarterback Tony Romo will go a long way toward determining whether he’ll play. \nAs explained by Charean Williams of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram , the Cowboys are leaning toward giving Romo some playing time . However, injuries along the offensive line will be a factor in the final decision. \nLeft tackle Tyron Smith already is out with a knee injury suffered Monday night against the Lions. Guard Ronald Leary is questionable; he didn’t practice all week. \nOn Friday, coach Jason Garrett said the plan for playing time will be finalized on Saturday night. \nRomo last played on Thanksgiving 2015, in a loss to the Panthers. Carolina went on to win the NFC championship. Dallas hopes to do the same with Romo as the No. 2 to rookie Dak Prescott .
