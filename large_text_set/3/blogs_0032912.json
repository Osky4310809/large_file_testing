It was developed back in 2013, but the nifty tool has recently resurfaced, much to the excitement of steak-lovers everywhere. Here’s how it works: you enter some juicy parameters, pick some temps to cook your cut with, then you’re shown an approximation of how your meat will turn out when it’s all said and done. You’ll see some familiar colors, like red, pink, and overcooked.

You can even compare two cooking methods to see which is better for that expensive slab of beef you picked up at the butcher. \nBut even with a high-tech tool like this, cooking the perfect steak is still up to you.
