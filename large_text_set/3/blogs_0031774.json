We fault him for being constitutionally incorrect,\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said in his opening arguments to the court Wednesday, according to NBC affiliate Hawaii News Now . \"While we understand that the President may appeal, we believe the court’s well-reasoned decision will be affirmed.” (4/4) — Hawaii AG (@AtghIgov) March 30, 2017 \nWatson, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked implementation of Trump's revised executive order, which the president issued after a federal judge in Washington blocked his first order and after an appeals court refused to reinstate it . \nThe new order lowered the named nations from seven to six — Iraq was dropped from the list — and it does not explicitly apply to current lawful permanent residents and green card holders, among other changes. \nBoth orders also would have put on hold admissions to the United States of refugees for 120 days. The first order indefinitely suspended admission of Syrian refugees, but that was dropped in the revised order. \nIn court Wednesday, Department of Justice attorney Chad Readler argued Hawaii has only made generalized concerns about effects to students and tourism. He said suspending the refugee program has no impact on Hawaii.
