Hours after expelling Akhilesh and Ramgopal Yadav from the party, Mulayam Singh Yadav annulled the expulsion order on Saturday .\nThe national convention is being watched for the unfinished agenda of Akhilesh being declared the CM face of his party. A final stamp, with the blessings of Mulayam, would complete the marginalisation of his rivals Shivpal Yadav and Amar Singh. Congress functionaries believe it would imply that Akhi lesh has the power to take a final call on Congress’ proposal for an alliance in the upcoming assembly polls.\nCongress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. (AF photo)\nThe Yadav scion has publicly favoured a tie-up with Congress despite opposition from father Mulayam.\nA senior Congress member said the damage done to SP’s public perception has been severe but it would be offset by Akhilesh’s crowning as the party’s future since he has positive ratings and is not a polarising figure like his elders.\n“Let us see what finally happens at the convention.The question is how much in future will Akhilesh be hobbled in his decision-making by other family members,“ he said.\nIn defiance of MulayamShivpal issuing a list of 393 of 402 assembly candidates, Akhilesh released his own list of 235 candidates. While the latter will see more names, the availability of seats for an alliance gives a margin of hope for Congress.\nThere is optimism that 100-odd seats could remain in play for Congress to consider an alliance which may also include Ajit Singh’s RLD.\nThough marginalised in UP politics, Congress is eager to save face in a seat-sharing formula, especially when Rahul Gandhi has undertaken a 26-day yatra across the state.\nLike Akhilesh, Congress too believes that despite its weak muscle, its inclusion would help the alliance gain momentum among anti-BJP voters like the minorities. – TNN", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T07:10:44.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
