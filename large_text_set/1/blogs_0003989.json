Joe Gomez has made five Premier League appearances for Liverpool. \nGomez returned to training with the Liverpool first team in November and he has played in several behind-closed-doors friendlies and some U23 games to work on his match fitness. \nA host of Championship clubs have asked Liverpool if they would consider loaning out Gomez during this month's transfer window, but Klopp has rebuffed all the enquiries as he plans to use the former Charlton youngster in the second half of the season. \nKlopp is a big fan of Gomez and he could include him in his squad for this weekend's FA Cup clash with Plymouth while he wants the teenager to provide cover in central defence with Joel Matip currently sidelined and Mamadou Sakho out of favour and expected to move on this month. \nPeter O'Rourke is ESPN FC's transfer news correspondent.
