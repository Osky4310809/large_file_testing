Ian Stewart was found guilty of Helen Bailey's murder \nThe chilling footage shows Ian being arrested and his subsequent police interview. \nAudio from Ian’s original call to police to report Helen missing will also be heard. \nMeanwhile, interviews with Helen’s close friends and neighbours will paint a picture of the couple’s relationship. \nThe documentary promises to tell a “story of deception, greed, lies and murder”. Helen Bailey was reported missing by her partner Ian Stewart (Photo: ITV News Anglia) \nThose close to the case – including journalists – will then tell the story of the “clues that gave him away”. \nWhile Psychologists and experts will analyse footage of Ian taken during the investigation to reveal how his behaviour ultimately led to his own downfall. \nHelen was missing for three months before she was found in a cesspit at her home with her pet dog.

The money will be shared between friends, relatives, ­charities and Stewart’s sons Jamie, 24, and Oliver, 21.
