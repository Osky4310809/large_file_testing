Whether you’re new to building things or an experienced tape measure veteran, you’ll probably learn a thing or two in this lesson. \nIn this video from the Essential Craftsmen YouTube channel , Scott Wadsworth explains how a tape measure works, how to use it, and handy tricks you can do with it. For example, you can use your tape measure as a compass if you latch the hook on a nail, use the edge of the hook as a quick way to mark wood for cutting, and you can use the tape of your tape measure as a makeshift straight edge if you need to draw straight line.
