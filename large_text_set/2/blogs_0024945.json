He’s auditioned once in his whole career\".

Adam’s loved by everyone.” The 38 year-old is believed to have bragged about his past experience as popularity (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Woodyatt and his on-screen family are TV faves (Photo: BBC) Read More EastEnders' June Brown \"absolutely delighted\" with Dot portrait to mark her 90th birthday \nHowever, an EastEnders spokeswoman refuted the claims, telling the Daily Star: “There is absolutely no truth in this. Danny is an extremely popular member of cast and respected by everyone on the show.” \nAdam said: “This is news to me considering Danny and I had a great chat before he went on his break. As Danny would say, it’s pony.” \nDyer is believed to be in South Africa on a break from filming the BBC1 soap. A source said: “He’s there to sort his life out.” \nHe is expected back on the EastEnders set next month. \nThe Mirror have contacted representatives for both Danny Dyer and EastEnders, but are yet to receive a response.
