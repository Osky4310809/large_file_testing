He was later cleared.\nFrom Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous \n \nHarrelson does admit that the temptation to smoke still exists.\n“Last night, someone had sativa; really good sativa. There’s a joint, and beautifully rolled,” he explained. “I just was like, ‘I mean, I’ve gone this long .’ It would be weird to just be like, ‘Okay, let me have a hit off that,’ and then suddenly go back to smoking too much.”\nHarrelson, however, says he is still a supporter of the drug.\n“I don’t have a problem at all with smoking,” he said. “I think it’s a great drug.” \nHe continued: “ I still drink. But I try to be moderate with the drinking, too.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:38:13.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
