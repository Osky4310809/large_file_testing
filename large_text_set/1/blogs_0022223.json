The NIA team also met the injured at Rayagada district headquarters hospital on Monday. \nWith possible sabotage being suspected in the derailment of the Hirakhand Express, the MHA has asked the NIA to see if the derailment was indeed a case of sabotage. \nCommissioner Rail Safety Ram Kripal and CID officials from Andhra Pradesh too started their probe at Kuneru station, collecting evidence from the mangled remains of the train. Ram Kripal started the probe at the railway guest house in Rayagada on Monday morning and visited the mishap site at Kuneru station in the afternoon. \nThe Vizianagaram GRP have already registered a case in this regard. Meanwhile, train services in the Rayagada-Vizianagaram section of Waltair division were restored this morning.
