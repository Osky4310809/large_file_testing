This is a losing argument on the merits, and it will only further drive evangelicals and faithful Roman Catholics further away. \nOpposition to DeVos’ nomination has nothing to do with her faith. There are plenty of Christians in government — including in the Democratic Party — who would do a fine job overseeing education in this country. DeVos, the Republican donor with no real qualifications for the Secretary position, isn’t one of them. Her desire to build up private Christian schools with taxpayer funds at the expense of public schools that serve everyone would be a problem regardless of the nominee’s faith. \nDemocrats oppose her because she’s a bad nominee with bad ideas, not because she’s a Christian. \nReed just wants to create another martyr for the cause so he can raise money off of her if and when she doesn’t get the votes she needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:46:17.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
