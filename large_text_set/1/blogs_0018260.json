Virgil van Dijk showed why he's so highly sought after, Tim Howard sparks Atlanta United rumours and more in The Sweeper. The ESPN FC crew question if Virgil van Dijk is the answer to fixing Manchester City's defensive frailties. \nSteven Gerrard has urged Liverpool to sign Southampton centre-back Virgil van Dijk. \nThe Netherlands international impressed against the Reds in the recent first leg of the EFL Cup semifinal, and has been linked with a Â£50 million away from St. Mary's . \nLiverpool have signed Adam Lallana, Nathaniel Clyne, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert from the Saints in recent seasons, and former captain Gerrard wants one more recruit from the south coast outfit. \nGerrard, who will return to Liverpool as an academy coach in February , told BT Sport : \"Who I think we need, I would go and try and bid for Van Dijk from Southampton. \n\"But we've had enough of their players so that will probably go down like a lead balloon.\" Virgil van Dijk has made 21 Premier League appearances this season. \nMeanwhile, Van Dijk is an injury concern ahead of Southampton's League Cup semifinal second leg at Anfield on Wednesday night. \nThe 25-year-old was forced off early into the second half of Southampton's 3-0 win over Leicester City on Sunday. \n\"He could not continue the game,\" Saints boss Claude Puel said afterwards . \"We will see for the next games. I don't know if we can recover him. \n\"He took a big kick and we will see if we can recover him for this game. We will see in the morning [Monday]. \n\"I hope we can have Virgil of course because he is our captain and he's an important player. \n\"Of course, it will be better to recover Virgil for this game.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
