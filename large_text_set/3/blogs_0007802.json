We are re-evaluating our participation in this event,\" the company said. \nA group spokesman told Boston media that the group was barred because its logo includes a rainbow, and the parade prohibits displays related to sexual orientation. \nThe parade is organized by the Allied War Veterans Council, which allowed the group to march in the last two year's parades. \nAfter an emergency meeting Friday afternoon, OutVets' executive director, Bryan Bishop, told The Associated Press that his group was told they could participate, but only if they removed the rainbow from their banners and jackets. \nBishop said OutVets refused, noting that the rainbow is a symbol of gay pride and solidarity. \nMeanwhile in St. Louis, the city's 48th annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade begins Saturday at noon, with Anheuser-Busch as a main sponsor. \nThe dignitaries stepping out first will include Mayor Francis G. Slay ; St. Louis Irish Consul Joseph McGlynn , Jr.; Mary Mitchell O’Connor , Ireland’s jobs ministers; and the honorary marshal, John Saunders , president and chief executive officer of FleishmanHillard. Police Chief Sam Dotson and Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson will head the first responders' entry. \nThe parade steps off from 20th and Market Streets and proceeds east on Market to Broadway and then south on Broadway where it will disband at Clark Street. Organizers expect about 130 units and 5,000 marchers. \nThe food and beverage event's Shamrock Village's food and beverage booths will operate from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T03:35:48.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
