The romantic number — composed by A. R. Rahman for director Mani Ratnam’s film Kaatru Veliyidai ( Cheliyaa in Telugu) — went viral and the one-minute promo video is already creating a lot of hype. Shashaa says she just can’t wait to see the song in the movie. “The scenery in the video is breathtakingly beautiful,” she says. \nShashaa has already been part of several chartbusters composed by Rahman including ‘Aye Mr. Minor’ ( Kaaviya Thalaivan) , ‘Naane Varugiraen’ ( Ok Kanmani ) and ‘Rasaali’ ( Achcham Enbathu Madamaiyada). She has tasted success with composers like D Imman (‘Silikku Marame’ Payum Puli ) and G V Prakash (‘Oday Oday’ in Raja Rani) . She teamed up with Rahman to recreate his iconic ‘Humma Humma’ song. The singer talks about her mentor and her journey. Excerpts: \nLife after ‘Vaan Varuvaan’ \nI feel grateful for everything. It was my dream to listen to my voice on the radio. And, I did. I switched on the radio and ‘Vaan Varuvaan’ was on air! For an artist, meeting the right people, and getting their support is a great thing. The fact that Rahman Sir saw something in my voice meant a lot. Being able to sing his new compositions is beyond my dreams. \nOn her growing fans \nThere is happiness, but I am also nervous. I feel responsible to them. I want to live up to their expectations and want to make a difference to their lives through my music. \nOn recreating ‘Humma Humma’ \nVisiting an A.R. Rahman song in any shape or form is in itself a blessing. I grew up listening to Remo’s version of ‘Humma Humma’ ( Bombay ). I was curious to hear what a lounge vibe to an otherwise pepped-up pop track would be like and how I would fit the bill, as the original song was a male-centric track. We tried out various tones in which I could sing the track and I was glad I could show another side of my singing. Even when the song was being edited, I didn’t know it was going to be in Ok Jaanu . \nVersatility of languages \nI have sung in Hindi, English, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Punjabi, Assamese, Sanskrit, Arabic and Armenian. I would like to sing in Mandarin or a language that has not received much exposure globally. \nChallenging songs so far… \n‘Naaney varugiraen’ from Ok Kanmani, and ‘Raasali’ from Acham Yenbathu Madmaiyada were challenging. The charanam in ‘Raasali’ was a tongue-twister. \nMusic scene now \nIt’s a great time to be in the industry. Here are new directors who experiment and try new styles and voices. They have become adventurous. It’s also no longer about one composer or singer enjoying a monopoly. \nHer inspirations (musicians/singers) \nIndian/Pak music: Rahman Sir, Nusrat saab, Vishal Dadlani, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Chitraji, Madan Mohan, Hussain Baksh, Shazia Manzoor. \nInternational: Armo, Michael Buble, Ella Fitzgerald, Najwa Karam, Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, Jem, Freddy Mercury, Melody Gardot \nHer mentor \nUndoubtedly, Rahman Sir. I dropped out of pre-med to pursue music as a career after listening to his ‘Aaruyire Mannippayaa’ ( Guru ) …My dream was to sing for him. I felt reborn when I met him. He identifies my potential and discovers a side to me which even I don’t know. He’s a magician", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:08:35.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
