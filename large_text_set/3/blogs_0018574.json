Of course, there can be only one reason why she would seek a doctor's advice - she must be pregnant! That's what many people clearly believe, as Balan told Mid-Day . \"Why is it that every time a woman, post marriage, visits a doctor, there are whispers of her pregnancy?\" \nSomeone had to say it, and we're glad that she did, and we're doubly pleased that she added, \"What is this baby obsession? I am not a baby-making machine. Anyway, the world population is on a rise. If some people don't have children, it's fine.\" \nThat's a sentiment many of us would relate to. Motherhood is a personal choice, and should be treated as such. Unless someone announces that they are pregnant, it is ridiculous to make assumptions.
