That's the $243.3 million polar research vessel that the internet overwhelmingly voted to give a ridiculous name. (It didn't quite stick, alas, but kind of lives on .)\nNow we have \"Footy McFooty Face.\"\nAs backstory: A dozen areas, including San Diego, are vying to become home to the next Major League Soccer franchise. To rally supporters and drum up some buzz, the San Diego ownership group let fans on the internet suggest and vote for potential team names via Facebook .\nLet's check in on the voting as of Tuesday afternoon.\nOh. Oh, my.\nLast week, Footy McFooty Face got some attention for topping the poll, too — but at that point, not many votes had been cast.\nBREAKING: Footy McFooty Face is leading the online Facebook vote for San Diego's MLS club name. pic.twitter.com/6rTXRwxYeC\n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) March 24, 2017\nAs you can see from the first screenshot, Footy McFooty Face now has nearly 8,000 votes while the next most-popular option has less than 2,500. So in other words: Footy McFooty Face is for real!\nBut just how real?\nWe'll see. Major League Soccer will reportedly select two areas for new franchises from its field of 12 candidates by the end of this year. Plus, it's just a bit tough to imagine a pro sports team actually naming itself Footy McFooty Face when push comes to shove.\nBut we can dream, weird internet people.
