Report: Samsung Galaxy S8 and Apple iPhone 8 to carry highest IP68 water-resistance rating By - January 16, 2017 “The IP68 certification allows a phone to survive in up to 1.5 metres of water for up to 30 minutes” \nAccording to a report by The Investor , the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 and Apple iPhone 8 flagships will sport the highest level of dust- and water-resistance. That means these phones will carry IP68 certification, which will allow them to survive in up to 1.5 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. \nIt’s worth mentioning that the Samsung Galaxy S7 flagship already carries IP68 certification, as do the brand’s recently launched new budget Galaxy A series devices. The iPhone 7 , on the other hand, features IP67 rating, which means it can stay underwater for half an hour in one metre of water. \n“Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the IP68 rating protection as part of drastic upgrades marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year,” an industry source told The Investor on condition of anonymity. The report also mentions that other than Samsung and Apple, LG and some other Chinese manufacturers will also be adding this feature to their upcoming devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T11:18:36.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
