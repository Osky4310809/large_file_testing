Because I checked her into Winchester jail. \n\"Every boy, every man wants to have the gun and go kicking in doors. \n\"It's exciting being like that but I prefer being the undercover detective kind of guy.\" \nHe’s got the gun, the badge and the handcuffs. He’s also got the look – black shades and tattoos snaking up his arms and across his chest and back. \nThen he speaks and his voice marks him out immediately as different. His accent is not drawn from Virginia Beach, on America’s Atlantic coast, where he makes his living but from the mean streets of Brechin in Angus. Christian used to part hard but now catches criminals (Photo: Mentorn Scotland) Read More Dog The Bounty Hunter's wife set for Celebrity Big Brother as Beth Chapman 'signs up as housemate' \nHe left the North-East at the age of 21 and headed across the Atlantic to meet his dad, former marine Ricky, and start a new life. Now 28, he’s succeeded on both counts. \nIn the BBC documentary - The Scottish Bounty Hunter - Christian tells how he felt the need to escape his home town because he was taking \"a lot of ecstasy\" during \"week-long parties\". \nHis job, however, sees him operating in the underbelly of American society. In Virginia Beach, he is a jailhouse regular, picking up and dropping off hardened criminals, junkies and hapless unfortunates whose immediate futures hang on the bail bonds which grant them freedom. \nWorking for the bondsmen who lend bail money to those who can’t afford it, Christian delivers clients from custody and takes them back when they go to trial. If they skip out on their bail, he hunts them down. \nHe told The Daily Record : “A lot of people say, ‘That’s really cool. I didn’t know they still did that.’ People picture me riding a horse with a badge and a cowboy hat or doing something similar to Dog the Bounty Hunter.” Famous bounty huner Duane \"Dog\" Chapman and his wife Beth (Photo: Reuters) \nThe reality is about to be shown in BBC documentary The Scottish Bounty Hunter, which follows Christian in his daily routine. \nHe is contracted by bondsmen, who get 10 per cent for each loan they make but risk losing everything if the accused don’t turn up in court. \nIt’s Christian’s job to track down those who go missing. \nHis first stop is usually social media and he laments that bounty hunters spend a lot of their time “Facebook checking”. \nDrugs are a major problem in Virginia, with heroin a particular menace, contributing to 800 deaths a year. \nIf Christian is dealing with a junkie, he knows they will either be looking for drugs or trying to raise money to buy them. He will lure them in with both. Christian certainly looks the part of a bounty hunter (Photo: Mentorn Scotland) \nDesperate people will do desperate things and there are obvious dangers but he doesn’t dwell upon them. \nHe said: “I have seen things and been places you only see in films. I have faced guns and knives. Does it give me pause for thought? Not really. \n“Overthinking in this business can get you killed. It can lead to mistakes which can get other people killed around you. \n“Believe it or not, I am not a gun person. I have never had to fire my gun in anger and I hope I never have to but there’s always potential. \n\"You can never tell who’s got a gun so we treat everybody as if they have until we find out otherwise. \n“I don’t know what happens or if it is just me – but I don’t have a whole lot of fear in life. \n“When I first started doing this, I was worried about it and I lost that after about a week. \n\"It doesn't matter where you are sending me or who you’re sending me for, I’ll get the job done.” Carrying a gun is important because the job can be dangerous (Photo: Mentorn Scotland) \nIt’s a tough business and Christian’s got a tough exterior. But he’s also got a lot of sympathy. \nThe documentary touches on his relationship with some of his repeat clients, including 21-year-old Megan Shannon, who thinks of him like a big brother. \nHe’s empathetic because he was no angel himself. In Brechin, his life was spiralling into one of drink, drugs, fights and getting in trouble with the police. \nHe wanted something different and worked as a bouncer to fund his way through bail enforcement training and join the National Bail Enforcers And Security Alliance of America. \nHe said: “I can see a lot of my old life in a lot of these people. I am not doing the same stuff, I never did what they are doing but I can still see a lot of wasted potential and that’s the thing that bothers me most because I am kind of proof that if you really want to do something just go ahead and do it. \n“Some of the stories I hear on the way back to jail, I can sift through them. Some are genuine others are bullsh", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:19:04.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
