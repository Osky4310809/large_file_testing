We bow to you, sir! We had reported about how Baasha , one of Thalaiva’s blockbuster hits in 1995, has released this week in a better, remastered print. Baasha, that was directed by Suresh Krishna, had Rajinikanth play an autodriver in the movie, and has the popular song ‘Njan autokaaran autokaaran…’, a song that is still played in autos if you go to Chennai. Baasha ran for a stupendous 368 days, while his very iconic dialogue ‘Naan oru dhadavai sonna, nooru dhadavai sonna maadhri…’ still reverberates among the masses. \nNow the remastered version has the movie releasing in 5.1 surround sound, and the movie will also be released in Hindi as well. How just because the movie is releasing in remastered version doesn’t mean it has to be set in the current times. When James Cameron re-released Titanic in 3D, he didn’t set the movie in 2000s. But that lesson doesn’t seem to have gone to the heads of the people behind Baasha’s re-release. Why you ask? \nWell, the people who have watched the movie have posted screenshots from the film, where Rajinikanth is driving a… believe it or not… an OLA auto. Yes, the service that was begun by the online cab aggregator last year, finds its way into the movie that is set in the ’90s. Forget OLA autos, even the idea of having OLA service must not have germinated in the idea of the owners then. This is some serious in-film product marketing that turned out funny as hell! \nNaturally, his fans have taken this as the power of Thalaiva… How can we differentiate re-released #Baasha ? \nSimple, everyone in the movie drives Ola Auto now! #OlaAuto pic.twitter.com/7mllZk1XaX", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T15:07:26.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
