It would expect voters to show government-issued photo identification at a polling place to confirm their identities before voting. Additionally, the legislation does away with the Automatic Voter Registration program on the state’s driver’s license application. \nLast Wednesday the Arkansas state Senate approved legislation that would require voters to present photo ID at the polls. The bill previously passed the state’s lower chamber back in January. Similar to other states, those voters who could not show an ID would sign a sworn statement that the voter is who he or she claims to be and cast a provisional ballot. The county clerk then compares signatures to previously signed voter registration cards. \nA Nevada Republican Assemblywoman proposed a bill a voter ID bill Monday requiring ID at the polls and has a measure for the Department of Motor Vehicles to provide voter ID’s free of charge if a person cannot afford one. \nOther states looking at voter ID proposal include , North Dakota, Georgia, Virginia, and Maine .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:52:43.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
