Rec Photo by Mark Runnacles/Getty Images As we enter the final 24 hours of the January transfer window, a few questions remain unresolved at Chelsea. Chief among those is the future of Asmir Begović, who’s definitely looking to leave, and if at all possible, he’s looking to leave right now. But that’s not going to happen unless and until Chelsea sign a replacement, and that effort is not going too successfully so far. Celtic’s Craig Gordon remains the most heavily linked replacement, but while the veteran’s contract is up for discussion with the club, they remain adamant about not selling him. Here’s Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers denying this rumor for the third time in four days. “I repeat, we don’t want to sell him. It’s between the club and his agent to find a new deal for him, which we believe we will do.” “It’s very simple. I spoke to you on Friday and told you he wasn’t moving. I told you last night there was no more movement. I will tell you the exact same thing. There’s nothing new to add. He will be in the team for the Aberdeen game.” “We want to keep him here and we’ve no intention of losing him. We will look to arrange a new deal with him.” -Brendan Rodgers; source: Evening Standard Now, what I think The Brodge is trying to say here, and I could be wrong because things aren’t always very clear in transfer rumors, but I think what he’s trying to say is that, well, Craig Gordon is not for sale and we should stop wasting our time.
