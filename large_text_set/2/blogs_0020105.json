The two musicians, both regular figures in New York's queer underground scene, were putting the finishing touches on their ambitious new project called INDEX Festival: A Living Archive , which was set to open its doors later that afternoon. \nSimilar to festivals like Afropunk, INDEX was conceived a platform for and by people of color, with a focus on Black and Latinx artists. But while you might go to Afropunk to check out a blockbuster Grace Jones set or a sick new punk band, INDEX, with a staggering lineup drawing primarily from the electronic music sphere, was where you found your new favorite club music DJ. The festival was stacked with headliners like the shape-shifting experimentalist Yves Tumor , revered Philly club duo SCRAAATCH , ballroom queen La'Fem Ladosha, sculptor/poet Rin Johnson, and dozens of other performers spread across five stages and 10 hours. Our trusted photographer Erez Avissar was around to capture the scenes below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:01:46.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
