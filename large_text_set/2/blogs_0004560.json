Manning and Fitzgerald both have a long track record of charity and volunteer work in addition to their professional success. \nThis is the third time the Man of the Year Award has been split. In 2000 Derrick Brooks and Jim Flanigan shared the award, while in 2006 Drew Brees and LaDainian Tomlinson shared it. \nManning and Fitzgerald entered the league together as the first and third overall picks in the 2004 NFL draft, and now as their careers wind down, they’re continuing to gain recognition together.
