(THE CANADIAN PRESS / Amber Bracken)   2:28PM EST \nEDMONTON - A man sentenced to life in prison last month for killing two missing Alberta seniors will be eligible for unescorted temporary absences on March 13. \nTravis Vader was convicted on Jan. 25 of two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of Lyle and Marie McCann, who disappeared in 2010 after leaving their Edmonton-area home to go camping in British Columbia. \nThe Parole Board of Canada says Vader has not applied for unescorted temporary absences and such applications can take about five months to process. \nThe board would consider sentencing comments made by the judge, a report from the Correctional Service of Canada and a review of Vader's criminal record. \nThe McCann family would also have the right to submit a statement to the parole board about how the crime has affected them. \nGary Sears, a parole board spokesman, says the main consideration in any parole application is public safety.
