And he's maintained that position since, even with all the new heroes that have come into the industry. But there's one person who has been giving him a tough competition in the last couple of years, and that is none other than his youngest son, AbRam. Last night, SRK and AbRam brought in Valentine's Day in the cutest way possible, giving us all feels. The duo took a late night walk together on Juhu beach, and even built a sandcastle, and it was SRK's Twitter post about it that really made our hearts melt. He said, \"a late night walk along the juhu beach...hand in hand...& the sand castle we made will last a life time..we r sure\", along with a picture of the two. The best way to bring in a day about love, we think! Take a look at the adorable post, here. a late night walk along the juhu beach...hand in hand...& the sand castle we made will last a life time..we r sure. pic.twitter.com/x8jqCQ0wGY", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:46:09.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
