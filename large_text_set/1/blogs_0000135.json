And while you may have heard that Indomie is popular in some other countries (they love them so much in Nigeria that one of their most famous rappers did a song about them ) did you know that Indomie is, in fact, one of the most purchased consumer brands in the entire world? That’s according to the results of the latest Brand Footprint study by research company Kantar Worldpanel . The annual report ranks the top 50 FMCG ( fast-moving consumer goods ) brands in the world based on consumer behavior data collected from over 300 billion shopper decisions. The study covers 15,000 brands in 44 different countries. \nThe top 10 list includes such global powerhouse brands as Dove, Nescafe, Lays and Colgate. And right there at #8 is Indofood's Indomie. Chart: Kantar Worldpanel \nThe list evaluates brands based on a metric Kantar calls “consumer reach points” which measures both how many households around the world are buying a brand (its penetration) and how often (the number of times shoppers acquire the brand). According to their data, Indomie has 1.89 million consumer reach points. \nThe report notes that Indomie is a powerhouse in Indonesia (being the number one FMCG brand in the country) but that it has been successful in expanding its brand into other countries such as Turkey. \nCoca-Cola obviously tops the study’s list of the world's must purchased brands. But we were surprised Indomie’s domination of the instant noodle category is not exactly complete - on the list at #4 is Maggi, a Nestlé-controlled company which makes seasoning, sauces and stocks but is perhaps best known for their instant noodles, which are extremely popular in some countries (even though they’re obviously inferior to Indomie). \nAt any rate, we’re proud to see an Indonesian brand doing so well at the global level and we believe the day may come when Indomie is synonymous with instant-noodley goodness around the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T10:28:33.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
