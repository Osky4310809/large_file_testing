As more and more countries and states follow the lead of China , Ireland, South Africa, Uganda and San Francisco in banning plastic grocery bags responsible for so much so-called “white pollution” around the world, PLA is poised to play a big role as a viable, biodegradable replacement. PLA Helps to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions \nProponents also tout the use of PLA—which is technically “carbon neutral” in that it comes from renewable, carbon-absorbing plants—as yet another way to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases in a quickly warming world. PLA also will not emit toxic fumes when incinerated. PLA Biodegrades Slowly Unless Subjected to Industrial Composting \nBut critics say that PLA is far from a panacea for dealing with the world’s plastic waste problem. For one thing, although PLA does biodegrade, it does so very slowly. \nAccording to Elizabeth Royte, writing in Smithsonian , PLA may well break down into its constituent parts (carbon dioxide and water) within three months in a “controlled composting environment,” that is, an industrial composting facility heated to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and fed a steady diet of digestive microbes. But it will take far longer in a compost bin, or in a landfill packed so tightly that no light and little oxygen are available to assist in the process. Indeed, analysts estimate that a PLA bottle could take anywhere from 100 to 1,000 years to decompose in a landfill. Recyclers Can’t Mix PLA and Other Plastics \nAnother issue with PLA is that, because it is of different origin than regular plastic, it must be kept separate when recycled, lest it contaminate the recycling stream. Being plant-based, PLA needs to head to a composting facility, not a recycling facility, when it has out served its usefulness. And that points to another problem: There are currently a few hundred industrial-grade composting facilities across the United States. Most PLA Uses Genetically Modified Corn \nAnother downside of PLA is that it is typically made from genetically modified corn , at least in the United States. The largest producer of PLA in the world is NatureWorks , a subsidiary of Cargill, which is the world’s largest provider of genetically modified corn seed. \nWith increasing demand for corn to make ethanol fuel , let alone PLA, it’s no wonder that Cargill and others have been tampering with genes to produce higher yields. But the future costs of genetic modification (and the associated pesticides) to the environment and human health are still largely unknown. Green-Minded Consumers May Prefer Alternatives to Plastics \nWhile PLA has promise as an alternative to conventional plastic once the means of disposal are worked out, consumers might be better served by simply switching to reusable containers—from cloth bags, baskets and backpacks for grocery shopping (most chains now sell canvas bags for less than a dollar apiece) to safe, reusable (non-plastic) bottles for beverages. Despite Problems, PLA Has Many Uses \nAs for other types of PLA items—such as those plastic “clamshells” that hold cut fruit (and there is a whole host of industrial and medical products now made from PLA)—there is no reason to pass them by. But until the kinks are worked out on the disposal and reprocessing end, PLA may not be much better than the plain old plastic it’s designed to make obsolete.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:17:08.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
