Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA BBC Wales trailer was taken down after sparking fierce online debate ahead of this weekend's Six Nations clash between Wales and England. \nOne Wales fan branded the ad \"borderline racism\". Yet others called it \"quality\" inter-nation banter. \nThe video asks: \"What is good about England?\" with the Welsh respondents unable to muster more than blank expressions in answer to the question. \nThe promo was shared on by BBC Wales' social media team on Wednesday night but was pulled by Thursday morning following a strong reaction. Wales fans were asked \"What's good about England?\" and responded with blank faces (Photo: BBC) The Six Nations advertisement attracted outrage when it was shared (Photo: BBC) Read More Although the intense rugby rivalry between Wales and England cannot be denied, many said the Beeb's treatment took it 'too far'. \nSome fans described it as \"parochial rubbish\", \"an embarrassment\" and \"borderline racism\". \nMirrorSport have asked BBC for a comment but are yet to receive a response. England head coach Eddie Jones and Dylan Hartley share a laugh on Thursday (Photo: REUTERS) \nDespite the response on Twitter, other fans on Facebook called the ad \"banter at its best\" and \"brilliant\". \nParochial adverts are nothing new for the BBC, however. \nTheir 2012 teaser had supporters dressed in the colours of all nations but England, chanting \"England\" with the tagline, \"The Six Nations. It's not about who you want to win...it's about who you want to lose\". \nBBC didn't air it but the video later leaked online.
