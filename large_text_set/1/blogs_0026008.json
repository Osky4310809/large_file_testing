But Musk’s Mars-bound company, SpaceX, is challenging students and independent engineers “to accelerate development of a functional Hyperloop prototype.”\nMusk first announced plans to build a one-mile test track two years ago (originally in Texas). Now the track, located next to SpaceX’s HQ, is apparently ready to go. The company will host a “Hyperloop pod race” there this weekend , as promised last year.\nIt will look sort of like this?\n\nBut inside one of these?\n\nSome companies trying to bring Musk’s Hyperloop idea to life have been accused of hawking vaporware. SpaceX says this competition is specifically “geared towards university students and independent engineering teams” and that “the knowledge gained here will continue to be open-sourced,” ultimately making the idea a bit more real for everyone.\nSpaceX plans to follow the event with a second one this summer, with a specific emphasis on “maximum speed.” That second competition is also open to students.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:05:17.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
