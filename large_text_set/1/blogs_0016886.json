It is Curry’s fourth All-Star Game selection and Durant’s eighth. \nJoining them in the Western Conference’s starting lineup are Houston’s James Harden , San Antonio’s Kawhi Leonard and New Orleans’ Anthony Davis . The Eastern Conference starters are Cleveland’s Kyrie Irving, Toronto’s DeMar DeRozan, Cleveland’s LeBron James , Chicago’s Jimmy Butler and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo. \nIn 2015, when Klay Thompson was an injury replacement in the starting lineup alongside Curry, Golden State snapped a 48-year streak without two starters in the same All-Star Game (Rick Barry and Nate Thurmond in 1967). Thompson and Draymond Green are expected to be named to the West squad when coaches’ votes for reserves are announced Jan. 26. \nDespite a strong push from his native country of Georgia, the Warriors’ Zaza Pachulia is unlikely to make his first career All-Star appearance next month. He was second among West frontcourt players in the second fan returns with 823,376 votes, but the longtime role player couldn’t withstand the inevitable dip when player and media ballots were recorded. \nAfter Pachulia came within 15,000 votes of being an All-Star starter last season, the NBA changed its voting system. Unlike past years, when starters were determined solely by a fan vote, the fan vote now accounts for only 50 percent. Players and media split the other half. \nCurry is second in the league this season in free-throw percentage (92.6) and three-pointers made (158), 12th in scoring (24.6 points per game) and 15th in assists (6.1). Though his production is down significantly from last season, the two-time reigning NBA MVP has gotten more comfortable playing alongside Durant in recent weeks. Curry, who needs nine three-pointers to tie Peja Stojakovic (1,760) for 13th on the NBA’s all-time list, has averaged 27.4 points on 46.7 percent shooting over his past eight games. \nDurant leads Golden State in scoring (26.2 points per game), blocks (1.7), free throws made (240), is ranked second in rebounding (8.6), and third in assists (4.7), steals (1.1) and three-pointers made (85). He is the only player in the NBA ranked in Top 10 in scoring and field-goal percentage this season. Despite playing with a cast of big names, Durant is posting career-highs in field-goal percentage, rebounds, blocks per game and assists per turnover ratio. \nConnor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
