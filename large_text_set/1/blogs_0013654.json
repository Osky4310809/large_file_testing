The aim for them is to get an accurate picture as possible of George’s final days.” George's live-in lover Fadi Fawz found his lifeless body on Christmas Day (Photo: FameFlynet UK Tel : +44 (0)20 3551 5049 Email : info@fameflynet.uk.com) \nBut a family member told us: “I’m worried that because everything is ­taking so long that it’s going to be bad news. We’re now fearing the worst. \n“We just want to know what ­happened. Why was he on his own? Why did his ­boyfriend sleep in his car when George has a big house? It’s all very strange. \n“We’re being kept in the dark. We’re still ­waiting to hear about the ­funeral. We just want ­answers and to lay him to rest.” \nGeorge’s live-in lover Fadi Fawaz, 40, who found his body at their home in Goring-on-Thames , Oxfordshire, looked glum ­yesterday as he bought a coffee in West London. A ­postmortem on the Careless Whisper singer came back inconclusive. \nLast week ­pictures emerged which showed the star was not a loner in the days before he died . At least ten people arrived at his large detached house.

Carlos, 59, who met George in Australia three years ago, said: “I had an intuitive feeling about it last year. \n“And it seems very coincidental to me that he was found dead on Christmas Day because he told me he hated Christmas as there were never any ­children around. \n“For me it is sadly a possibility he may have overdosed.” \nCarlos added: “George’s death knocked me sideways, although it didn’t surprise me. \n“I found him a lovely down-to-earth man, but also a very melancholic person who I feared might one day take his own life. \n“He told me he was addicted to ­anti-depressant medicine and trying to wean himself off it and confessed he was unhappy. \n“We talked about his superstar ­status and I told him I thought that with his fame and talent and money he had all he needed to be happy. \n“But when he started talking about the anti-depressants he took I asked him outright if he was happy in life and he replied, ‘No, I’m not.’” \nCarlos’s comments came as George’s final moments were revealed by Fadi’s nephew Josh. A couple were seen leaving the singer's home (Photo: David Shepherd) \nHe told how his distraught uncle called him in floods of tears after ­finding the pop legend unresponsive in bed on December 25. \nThe conversation took place as ­paramedics tried to revive him, with Fadi telling Josh: “Oh God, I think he’s dead. George he’s not moving. \n“Oh God, he’s dead. They’re taking his body away now.” \nJosh said: “Two days prior to George’s death I was in a pub in London with my uncle and he called George to say he’d be home soon. \n“They were living together. They hadn’t split. \n“I’ve never heard a grown man cry so much. Fadi called me saying, ‘What am I going to do without him?’ \n“They spent almost every day ­together for six years. \n“He was so upset, he had been crying at the house beside George. \n“Fadi has had the finger pointed at him but it’s all bullsh**.” Fadi has been interviewed for a second time by police as they prepare a coroner’s report.

Roman admits it has been difficult getting his head round George’s sudden death. \nHe said: “My connection to George is very personal to me. It means a lot. He was an ­incredible artist and will be timeless. It’s been tough, it’s a difficult thing. People forget that he’s a person and it’s very personal. \n“I’ve got some great memories but they are personal to me. I miss him.” \nGeorge sold more than 80 million records worldwide in a career spanning four decades. \nHe began as one half of pop duo Wham! but became famous in his own right with his debut solo single Careless Whisper.
