I wanted an outlet to continue to tell stories, and Kyle provides that. \nHer first piece seemed to balance Gudel’s reporting sensibilities with Crossing Broad’s outside-the-box coverage of Philadelphia sports. The veteran reporter interviewed Phillies outfielder Howie Kendrick \n“This might seem like a curious addition given the tone of the site — and it is — but I think we can continue to be our usual snarky selves while at the same time incorporating some more traditional reporting,” said Scott, who launched the growing, and often profane, sports blog seven years ago and now employs one full-time staffer, Jim Adair, and several paid contributors. \nGudel will be Crossing Broad's second attempt at having a credentialed reporter producing stories.
