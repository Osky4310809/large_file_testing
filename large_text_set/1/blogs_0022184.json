Some start out strong and end up losing viewers over time, while others just can’t make it work in their freshman season. Plus, as audiences know all too well, cancellations aren’t always predictable. While some seem doomed right from the start, others remain on the bubble for some time ( Sleepy Hollow , Bones ).\nIn the coming months, all five major networks will have to decide which entries from their lineup — from sitcoms to to fantasy dramas — will get officially pulled. Here’s a look at 14 shows that may be counting this TV season as their last.\n1. Maya and Marty in Manhattan Maya & Marty | NBC\nNBC’s second attempt at a variety show (following Neil Patrick Harris’s Best Time Ever ) failed to impress in its freshman season. The show, hosted by Maya Rudolph and Martin Short, features various comedy sketches, musical performances, and celebrity guests. Though its premiere garnered a solid 6.26 million viewers, ratings declined quickly, with the sixth and final episode dipping down to only 3.94 million viewers. With lackluster ratings and equally mixed reviews, NBC may not want to take another chance on Maya and Marty .\n\n2. BrainDead BrainDead | CBS\nThere were high hopes for this new comedy hailing from The Good Wife creators Robert and Michelle King. But so far, the series hasn’t been quite as big of a success as their last CBS show. After earning 4.5 million viewers in its premiere episode, the show has seen a dip in ratings, with its seventh episode garnering 1.7 million viewers. If the show manages to rebound, it still has a shot — especially the Kings have a longstanding relationship with the network. But if the series continues on the rapidly declining track, it probably won’t stick around for much longer.\nUpdate 10/18/16 : CBS has officially canceled BrainDead. \n\n3. American Gothic American Gothic | Source: ABC\nABC’s latest mystery drama earned only okay reviews in its June debut and its ratings are even more mediocre. The show drew 3.4 million viewers for its premiere episodes, but more recent episodes have dwindled down to around 2.4 million viewers. Between the diminishing ratings and the general lack of buzz surrounding the series, there’s a chance ABC will pull the plug on American Gothic after its first season concludes.\nUpdate 10/18/16 : CBS has pulled the plug on American Gothic .\n\n4. Notorious Notorious | ABC\nABC’s new drama is only a few episodes in, but it’s already looking doomed for cancellation. The series, which is serving as a replacement for Scandal this fall, earned pretty dismal reviews ahead of its debut. It’s also failed to impress ratings-wise, dropping 16% from 5.3 million viewers to 4.5 million viewers in its second week and also earning only a so-so demo score of 1.0. Whether it can improve remains to be seen, but so far, Notorious is proving to be a poor fill-in on ABC’s Thursday night block.\nUpdate 1/23/17 : Though ABC has not formally canceled the series, the network cut the episode order for the show’s freshman season and is unlikely to order future seasons.\n\n5. The Exorcist The Exorcist | Fox\nGiven the classic predecessor it has to live up to, The Exorcist earned surprisingly decent reviews in the lead-up to its premiere. Unfortunately, it hasn’t fared anywhere near as well in viewership. The Fox show didn’t exactly come out swinging in its premiere and it fell another 40% in the following week. Of course, it’s early on, so it still has a chance to rebound. But if it doesn’t improve, it could definitely find itself on the chopping block at the end of the season.\n\n6. MacGyver MacGyver | CBS\nThough the CBS remake has earned a poor critical reception in its debut, it still managed to fare well in its premiere, earning 10.9 million viewers and a 1.7 score in the key demo. But audiences apparently didn’t stay interested for long. The show saw a dip in both its viewership and demo score in the subsequent week. CBS has high standards when it comes to rating (its home to The Big Bang Theory , after all), so it could be in jeopardy, if ratings continue to decline.\n\n7. Rosewood Rosewood | Fox\nFox’s drama managed to earn a second season renewal last year, despite terrible reviews and only okay ratings. But things have changed this time around. The second season of Rosewood is averaging a 0.73 rating in the 18-49 demographic and drawing an average audience of 3.30 million viewers. Compared to its first season, that means Season 2 is down by 31% in its average total audience. The decrease could signal the show’s potential end, although a decision has yet to be announced.\n\n8. Conviction Conviction | ABC\nThe new ABC drama has proven to be disappointing in more ways than one. The show, which marks Hayley Atwell’s return to the network after the cancellation of Agent Carter, earned not-so-great reviews from critics. It also failed to impress in its premiere, only bringing in a 1.0 rating in the key demo and 5.4 million viewers. That makes it among the lowest-rated premieres this season. Subsequent weeks didn’t do much better, which doesn’t bode well for its future.\nUpdate 1/23/17 : ABC has opted not to produce any more episodes of Conviction , although the cast is still under contract for the time being.\n\n9. Scream Queens Scream Queens | Fox\nFox’s horror comedy earned a second season renewal, largely because it made up for soft ratings with significant DVR and on-demanding viewing. But this season hasn’t been quite as successful. So far, the sophomore season of the series is falling well below last year’s average in live viewership and demo score – and unlike last season, it’s DVR viewership isn’t adding much. Right now, its future remains a toss-up. But if the show can’t stabilize in the upcoming weeks, it might find itself in jeopardy of cancellation.\n\n10. Frequency Frequency | The CW\nThough the CW’s new adaptation earned decent reviews ahead of its debut this fall, it hasn’t fared quite as well in ratings. The show has garnered an average 0.3 demo score and 1.02 million viewers so far this season. That’s pretty low, even for the CW. To be fair, it’s not the only show on the network pulling in those kinds of numbers. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is performing similarly and while that may normally be cause for replacement, the show has proven to be a good opportunity for the network to get some awards recognition. Since Frequency is unlikely to do the same, it may be in jeopardy later this year.\nUpdate 1/23/17 : Although the show is not officially canceled, the network has decided not to order additional Season 1 episodes of Frequency. \n\n11. The Blacklist The Blacklist | NBC\nNBC’s The Blacklist was a solid performer for the network in its first four season, but Season 5 is starting off rockier…way rockier. The show is earning significantly lower ratings than it did last fall, with a poor 1.1 score in the 18-49 demo. Given its successful history on the network, NBC probably won’t be too quick to pull the plug. But if things don’t turn around, the drama could be in danger of cancellation after this season.\n\n12. Son of Zorn Son of Zorn | Fox\nSince its debut, the part-animated, part live-action series has been pulling in only so-so-ratings for Fox. Its freshman season has raked in an average of 3.4 million viewers and a 1.3 score in the key demo. While those numbers are pretty on par with Fox’s other quirky comedy, The Last Man on Earth, the latter has earned critical acclaim and become an award season contender over the last couple of years. Plus, it’s closer to syndication than Son of Zorn . With Son of Zorn underperforming and earning mixed reviews, it could find itself on the chopping block at the end of this season.\n\n13. Elementary Elementary | CBS\nElementary is in its fifth season on CBS, but it may not be around much longer. Though never a huge ratings earning for the network, the show saw a significant drop in viewership last season — and things aren’t going much better this time around. In recent episodes, the show only drew a 0.6 rating in the 18-49 demo – low by any standards, but especially by CBS’s. Given those numbers, and the fact that the series now has enough episodes for syndication, the network may decide to do away with it altogether.\n\n14. Secrets and Lies Secrets and Lies Season 2 | ABC\nIt was kind of surprising that ABC decided to bring Secrets and Lies back for a sophomore season, considering that it was billed as a one-off miniseries and didn’t earn great ratings. Unfortunately, Season 2 is proving to be even more disappointing, earning only an average 0.7 demo score and 3.2 million viewers so far. Unless the show sees a sudden uptick in the coming weeks, it’s unlikely to get a third shot from the network.\nCheck out Entertainment Cheat Sheet on Facebook!\n\nRead the original article from The Cheat Sheet ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:21:04.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
