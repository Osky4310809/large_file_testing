Bean Created A Pro-Trump PAC That's Now Under Investigation The story begins with Linda Bean's Making America Great Again LLC PAC, which allegedly was in violation of FEC rules thanks to personal donations from Bean herself. The committee, Making America Great Again LLC, was notified Wednesday by the FEC that it had exceeded individual contribution limits, including three separate donations totaling $60,000 by Bean herself.
