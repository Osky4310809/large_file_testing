This has been a disaster for 18 months.”\nMcCloughan, the official said, has received alcohol treatment since joining the franchise in January 2015, but he hasn’t actively worked for the team in weeks. Even before McCloughan left Redskins Park abruptly late last month, the official said, he had already been placed in “timeout” because of his behavior.\n“He didn’t make the best of his third chance in the NFL,” the official said, alluding to the two previous jobs McCloughan has lost for alcohol abuse.\nWriter Mike Jones from WaPo seems convinced that the Redskins dysfunction is on full display here and that McCloughan’s firing was due to jealousy within the organization instead of his drinking. \nWas told late in the season of jealousy up top and how they'd one day use McCloughan drinking as an excuse to can him. Exactly what happened\n— Mike Jones (@MikeJonesWaPo) March 10, 2017 \n\nOh Redskins. \n.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:39:25.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
