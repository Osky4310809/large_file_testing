Everyone knows she would be the perfect package.\" \nThe much-loved dating show was hosted by beloved Cilla for nearly two decades before she hung up her matchmaking heels in 2003 and the show was cancelled. \nIt was initially thought former Geordie Shore babe Vicky Pattison was in the running to become the new host, and producers were then believed to have turned their attentions to Kylie Minogue. Vicky Pattison was also rumoured to be in the running for the job (Photo: Goff) \nAlso said to be in the frame is singer Olly Murs, 32, as well as actresses Georgia May Foote, 25, and Helen Flanagan, 26. \nThe show will be produced by So Television – which makes The Graham Norton Show – and Stellify Media - a company part-owned by Sony Pictures Television. \nIt's expected to appeal to “a new generation of viewers” while keeping some of the “traditions of the past”. Helen Flanagan was thought to be up for the hosting role too (Photo: ITV) \nThere’s likely to be six or eight episodes in the first series that will be shown on Friday nights. \nJust like the previous format, it revolves around three singletons hidden from the view of a member of the opposite sex who chooses them based on their answers – rather than their appearance. \nThe new version will be up against ITV’s Take Me Out and Meet The Parents. \nChannel 5 would give no comment on who the host of the show will be. \nMirror Celeb has contacted Catherine's representatives for comment.
