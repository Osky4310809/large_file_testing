As Ashley pointed out, the two never actually had a song together in “High School Musical,” meaning THIS IS THEIR FIRST DUET EVER TOGETHER. YouTube \nIf you recall, Sharpay and Gabriella hated each other, so I guess that makes sense. BUT LIKE, WTF, DIRECTORS? WHY COULDN’T YOU HAVE MADE IT HAPPEN?! \nWHY HAS IT TAKEN 11 DAMN YEARS — 11 PAINFUL AND LONG YEARS — FOR US TO HEAR THEIR VOICES COME TOGETHER TO CREATE MAGIC? \nWhatever, I’ll stop complaining and just enjoy. Also, Ashley’s husband made an appearance because he did the arrangement so like, prepare to feel old AF. YouTube As expected, the video immediately went viral and was shared everywhere on social media. Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Hudgens just released a cover of Ex's & Oh's and I'm shook to the core. pic.twitter.com/6jFz8pcQ7v \n— Relatable Quotes (@RelatableQuote) January 3, 2017 \nThe original song, which is sung by Elle King, is pretty good in itself, but IDK — Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale’s version might just take the cake. \nBe sure to watch the epic video above and feel like a 14-year-old tween all over again. “Once a Wildcat, always a Wildcat.” Disney Channel \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T15:57:43.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
