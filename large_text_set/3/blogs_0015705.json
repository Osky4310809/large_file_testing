Portland Timbers (no change) Portland expects to get goals from Diego Valeri and Fanendo Adi, but when David Guzman finds the back of the net it's a bonus -- especially when it proves important in a 4-2 win over the Houston Dynamo . \n2. FC Dallas (no change) Back at close-to-full strength in league play, Dallas looked fatigued against the New England Revolution following their CONCACAF Champions League win over Pachuca at midweek, but still managed to pull off a 2-1 win at home .

Toronto FC (+4) Without Sebastian Giovinco the Reds looked pretty toothless against the Vancouver Whitecaps, but Brek Shea's red card provided a spark as they scored twice late in a 2-0 victory . \n4. Seattle Sounders (+6) The first win of the year for the Sounders, a 3-1 result over the New York Red Bulls , also saw the first goal of the year for U.S. forward Jordan Morris. \n5. New York Red Bulls (-2) Two shots on goal at Seattle is not going to cut it for a team that is used to creating more clear cut chances, even on the road. Clint Dempsey and Jordan Morris led the way as Seattle capped their MLS Cup title celebration with a win over New York. \n6. Houston Dynamo (-1) The first major test of the Dynamo's new-look side proved that it might be the defense that needs some work under head coach Wilmer Cabrera, as they let in four goals at Portland. \n7. Atlanta United (+9) It's getting harder and harder to deny that Atlanta United might be one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference after their 4-0 thrashing of the Chicago Fire , which saw Josef Martinez add to his tally with a brace.
