I'm of the opinion that Dick Clark would not have let an artist go through that and he would have been as mortified as I was in real time.\" \nWhile the incident won't prevent the 46-year-old from doing a live event in the future, it will make her \"less trusting of using anyone outside of my own team.\" \nPhotos: NYE 2016 — How Celebs Rang In 2017! \nAnd although most of the Internet has relentlessly roasted the diva for the lip-synched and disoriented performance, Mariah says her \"true fans\" have been nothing but supportive! She added: \n\"My true fans have been so supportive and I am so appreciative of them and everybody in the media that came out to support me after the fact because it really was an incredible holiday season that turned into a horrible New Year's Eve.\" \nBefore her \"horrible\" NYE, the songstress has no doubt had a great past few months — she has a new beau and is totally in \"love\"… with her new docu-series Mariah's World ! \nRelated: Mariah Wants Bryan Tanaka To Be Her 'New Year's Kiss'! \nAs for what she hopes her fans take away from her reality show, she said: \n\"I hope that fans love it as much as I do and are having a good time watching it. And that they can see that we really went there and gave them a candid look into Mariah's World. We held nothing back.\" \nIf only Mariah's World explained what actually went down in Times Square! \nMaybe we'll see behind the curtain in season two?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:59:51.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
