It is not possible to ensure the security of every person coming and going.” \nMuheen Ahmed, the medical superintendent at the Sehwan hospital, confirmed 30 people were killed and said women and children were among the dead – although some local news channels reported higher numbers. \nDr Ahmed said the hospital lacked the necessary beds to cope with the incident and some people had been sent to Hyderabad, 90 miles away. \nPakistan has seen a spike in terrorist attacks in recent days, including an attack on peaceful protesters in the heart of Lahore, a bomb in Quetta that killed two police officers and an explosion in the frontier city of Peshawar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:54:37.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
