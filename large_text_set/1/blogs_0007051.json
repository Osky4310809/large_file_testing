Most of his filmography is a dream for many actors. He is one of the first actors to have made a successful transition from theatre to small screen to big screen and later to international cinema. His roles in Hollywood films like I Love New York, The Mighty Heart, The Namesake, The Amazing Spider-Man, Life Of Pi, Jurassic World and Inferno have made him a known face in the West. \nHe has had a fair share of TV shows and theatre in India until he got his big break and much needed recognition in Tigmanshu Dhulia’s directorial debut Haasil , where he played the main antagonist and since then, there was no looking back for the star. He had starred in much acclaimed and much loved films like Maqbool, Pan Singh Tomar , for which he won his first National Award, Talvar, Madaari, Piku among others. So on occasion of his birthday, we take you through Irrfan’s 5 most underrated performances over the years. \n# Yeh Saali Zindagi \nThis was one of the surprise hits of the 2011. Irrfan Khan’s role as an unrequited love lorn was praised by critics and fans alike. His dialogues in the film were much appreciated. The actor’s character was all about how far can one go to save the one they love and in this case it was one sided love of Irrfan’s for Chitrangada Singh. \n# D-Day \nHe played an undercover RAW agent living in Pakistan where he is married to a Pakistani woman and they have a child. Khan’s performance was one of the most layered ones of the last decade. Watch out for the pre climax scenes, they were EPIC. \n# Qissa \nIn this little gem he played a Sikh father who desires a son to continue the family lineage but when his fourth daughter is born, he decides to wage a fight against destiny. He fosters the daughter as a son and want her to gain strength, endurance, and ability to shoot a gun like a son. In Qissa, Irrfan’s character goes through many emotions. The earnest with which he portrays all of it, should be an acting class for all the hopefuls. \n# Right Yaaa Wrong \nThere are high chances that you are unaware about this film but trust me, this film is worth your time. The film star red Sunny Deol, Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma. This thriller had Sunny and Irrfan at loggerheads. Expect fireworks when the two start their cat and mouse game. Watch out for the climax, Irrfan is just brilliant in those scenes. Also, if you haven’t already, catch this one. \n# Sunday \nIrrfan Khan in a Rohit Shetty film now that is something you don’t imagine but it happened and the result was Sunday. Although the film didn’t work as expected at the box office, but it was Irrfan’s comic act of a struggling actor that stole the limelight from Rohit’s favourites Ajay Devgn and Arshad Warsi. His chemistry with Arshad Warsi was so good and the scenes of all three of them together were the highlights of this comic thriller. Wonder why don’t we see him in comedies more, his comic timing is just perfect. \nApart from these films, there are many other films where irrespective of the film’s fate at the box office he was top notch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T08:09:13.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
