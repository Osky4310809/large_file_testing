I’m living in a graveyard in a tent,’ Nichola said. ‘My hygiene is the biggest problem and it’s starting to get really cold out there. It’s getting me down.’\n \nNichola, whose 11-year-old son was recently taken into care, was living in a flat in Hull, East Yorkshire, before Hull City Council booted them out.\nShe describes living outside in the freezing cold as a ‘nightmare’ and feels she has failed her four children.\nThey set up tents side by side (Picture: SWNS) But workers at the local authority say the couple are avoiding help after racking up over debt which is mounting ‘by the day’.\nNichola said: ‘The first few days I was trying to put a smile on my face but when I went back in my tent I just cried.\nHorse gets stuck after trying to climb on top of her stable ‘There are some places you can go to get a wash but sometimes I just can’t be bothered to get out of the tent because I’m so tired. It has just been a nightmare.’\nNichola, who is also a grandmother-of-five, said: ‘My kids don’t know I’m homeless and my mum doesn’t know either.\n‘It should be me looking after them. I feel like I have failed them so I don’t want them to know anything – the world can be a cruel place.’\nNichola, a former boarding school cleaner, thinks that more and more council house tenants are being evicted because they cannot afford their rent.\nNichola Claxton with a friend (Picture: SWNS) She said: ‘I’ve seen people in doorways with quilt covers and there are more and more people getting evicted nowadays.\nFormer boxer Michael Watson hospitalised after attack in east London ‘It’s not good – they shouldn’t be able to just kick you out on the street.’\nDespite receiving some income through benefits, she said it’s hard to afford a hot meal.\n‘I do get money coming in but it’s hard to eat on the streets,’ she said. ‘We’ve got a little stove for cups of tea and soup but that’s it.’\nUrging other rough sleepers to get help, she said: ‘It could be anybody at any time – it doesn’t matter if you are a drinker, drug addict or a working person, it can happen to anybody.’\nThe council responded Dave Richmond, city neighbourhoods and housing manager at Hull City Council, said: ‘There was an eviction that took place in respect of her partner but only after that case had been in court three times over the last 18 months. \n‘By the time of the eviction, the debt stood at more than £2,000. \n‘We are not aware that they have approached us for help and assistance – if they did we could maybe signpost them somewhere else. \n‘If they had paid some of this off we would have carried on with that agreement at Great Thornton Street. \n‘But if someone is not engaging with us and the debt is rising week after week we can’t carry on.’ \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:35:16.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
