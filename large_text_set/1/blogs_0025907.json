In the show's run, fans have been treated to an ominous message from an older Barry Allen ( Grant Gustin ), as well as Stephen Amell 's portrayal of 'Old Man' Oliver Queen . \nAnd now, it sounds like viewers will be treated to yet another unique interpretation of an Arrowverse character on Legends of Tomorrow . As one of the show's executive producers, Marc Guggenheim , revealed on Entertainment Weekly Radio's Superhero Insider , this special appearance will occur in the sixteenth episode of Legends' sophomore season. \n“ I n the penultimate episode we’re gonna have - I can’t be specific about this, but it’s one of the most fun things I think we’ve ever done on the show - a character from one of the other shows on Legends in a way that you’ve never seen before.\" \nWhile Guggenheim is remaining silent on who this mystery appearance will be, he hinted that the version of the character you see on Legends might be a one-off appearance. \"Y ou may never see [that version of the character] again. But [it] will, I think, just send fans into squeals of joy.” \nThis tease might leave fans with way more questions than answers, much like the equally mysterious unveiling of Rex Tyler/Hourman in Legends' season one finale. \nThere is a chance that this interpretation of the character could be from an alternate timeline, much like Old Man Oliver was in the episode 'Star City 2046.' While the Legends have spent the season chasing after time abberations, they by no means have fully mastered the art of time travel, and could end up sending the Waverider into a new timeline. \nAn equal possibility could rely on the Arrowverse's use of the multiverse. While inter-dimmensional travel, and the variety of dopplegangers resulting from it, has primarily been left to The Flash , we could see dopplegangers of other Arrowverse characters on Legends without having to leave Earth-1. Since the events of Supergirl have been confirmed to occur on Earth-19, there is a chance the Legends could run into any of the Earth-1 versions of Kara Zor-El 's team (or maybe even her doppleganger, Power Girl) . \nBut taking into consideration the plot of Legends ' second season - particularly the Legion of Doom's hunt for the reality-altering Spear of Destiny - only makes the possibilities of this appearance even more limitless. If the Legion of Doom do, in fact, briefly succeed in gathering the pieces of the Spear of Destiny, the changes they make with it could result in any sort of aftershocks in the Arrowverse - which seems like the most likely guess for how this unique cameo is brought onto our screens. \nIn addition, Guggenheim teased that an established Arrowverse character will play a part in Legends' season two closer. “We, just yesterday, made an offer to an actor to reprise their role from one of the other shows in the season finale of Legends.” \nWho do you think these two mystery cameos could be?
