Kong: Skull Island is a lot of things: a throwback adventure movie, a war movie, sometimes a comedy movie. Roberts spoke with GQ about what inspired his take on Kong, how men perceive their role in the world, and how to make a film your own when it's connected to a larger universe. \nGQ: First, I want to get this question out the way: Is Richard Jenkins in this movie? Jordan Vogt-Roberts: Is he in this movie? (laughs) he is in this movie and he is... the man. \nHe’s only in there for one scene. It's a strange little cameo. Yeah, that was something that came about later in shooting. I love movies where big actors show up in films for one little scene. I just love when someone can come in and not take it over but bring something that a master like Richard Jenkins can. \nEspecially now at the moment, kaiju/monster movies are making their way back into the mainstream in the West, you look at Pacific Rim , the MonsterVerse, even something like Colossal , why do you think that's a well people are going to more and more at the moment? Well, with Kong I think it's a very enduring piece of pop culture because he ultimately represents this idea that everyone on this planet is misunderstood. Unlike most monsters, he's a much more empathetic creature. EDITOR’S PICK Tom Hiddleston on Taylor Swift, Heartbreak, and Great Bolognese \nAnd in a certain way, Skull Island inverts the monster myth. Humans are the ones for the most part doing the destruction of Kong's area. To me it's just a comment on society, and men in general. We think we’re the gods of our domain, and what happens when you're truly confronted with a myth, with a god, with something greater than you? I loved getting into the psyche of someone like Sam Jackson's character, who just lost the war and is confronted with a god, and he says to himself, \"Well, wait, men are gods; we're the gods here.\" It's your duty as a god, as a man, to destroy this thing. \nDefinitely. So you mentioned this film takes place right after the Vietnam War. A lot of people have said it's shot like a war movie, but to me, other times it feels like a Planet Earth-style nature documentary. Is there anything you watched or researched specifically? I talked a lot about both of those things during the making of it. That scene with Kong and the octopus was very much being pitched as a Planet Earth moment. You get \"Cool, two creatures fighting!\" but ultimately it's like a Planet Earth documentary moment, like \"Oh! This is what a day in the life of this thing is like!\" There’s the quiet moment there, like after the lion catches its prey and it's just sitting there with blood on its face and you see the reality of the situation. \nAnd sure, the ’70s war moves were a huge influence, but then also more modern movies like The Thin Red Line . My influences are... sort of sporadic works. South Korean cinema, like The Host , is great at taking Western genre tropes and really flipping them on their head and elevating genre to A+ level movies. And I think there's a little bit of a throwback \"adventure\" vibe, like Indiana Jones or the awe of Jurassic Park . I think Aliens was another big one. \nI think a lot of video game and anime stuff was also in there. The video game angle is a response to these action sequences in contemporary movies—when the sequences go on and on and you're like, \"Oh my god, I'm still watching this one thing.\" Whereas you look at Raiders , for example, or Star Wars , and the set pieces are far more contained. There are parts in this movie that are reactions to these bloated movies that are made now with sequences that go on forever. \nThis film will obviously be compared with Godzilla from three years ago. It seems like, unlike a lot of \"connected universe\" movies , there wasn't too much of a mandate to make any kind of heavy-handed tonal connection. They're very different movies in almost every way. Yeah. Listen, I think Gareth [Edwards] directed the hell out of that movie. There's a ton visually and in the way he shot that movie that I think is incredible. But that's a very somber movie. You know? \n\"You get 'Cool, two creatures fighting!' but ultimately it's like a Planet Earth documentary moment, like after the lion catches its prey and it's just sitting there with blood on its face and you see the reality of the situation.\" \nLegendary and Warner Brothers just wanted to make the best version of this movie. Obviously you have to make sure these movies can link up, but not only is this a different story, it's a completely different pop culture movie. That's why I was talking about those South Korean movies. Those movies from the ’70s and ’80s play with tone. Most movies now just do one specific thing. And it's a case of balance. You could easily lean too hard on something and throw the movie off, but I think people will walk out of this movie and think, \"Whoa, that was a lot of different feelings, vibes, and emotions,\" that hopefully all congeal together. But luckily there wasn't much of a mandate beyond sort of future-proofing these worlds. \nI want to talk about the characters, who all inhabit their own spaces in this film. It's strange, in a way, to see John C. Reilly and Samuel L. Jackson's characters existing side by side. As well as that, Marc Evan Jackson's just around, being deadpan and phenomenal as always. Oh! I'm glad you know Marc Evan Jackson's name! [ Laughs ] More people should. \nAll these characters represent a different type of movie. Tom [Hiddleston] represents a kind of throwback adventure movie. I mean in theory, on paper, all these characters should break the movie, right? But hopefully we layered it properly. John C. Reilly's character, if you were to describe that to someone, should break the film. But instead, he almost makes it more real in a way. And he's saying these things that are insane, next to characters who are, in the moment, serious. But hopefully it makes it even more grounded. \nInevitably, this film is also going to be compared to Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong , which was a very different movie. This Kong feels a little more deliberate and mythical, a little less \"just a big gorilla.\" Well sure! They've stepped into his home and they're destroying this place, which in many ways speaks to and parallel a lot of conflicts that we find ourselves in that I can't really talk about here [laughs]. When you're telling a Kong story it's like a cover band. Why be a cover band of a cover band? You need to go back to the beginning and have a really interesting take. \nSo the next time we see your Kong I'm guessing it's going to be set in the modern day? This is a very self-contained story, so I'm guessing we won't be coming back to those characters. Was that freeing in a sense? It was very freeing. It allowed me to take this Vietnam War movie and make, like... Apocalypse Now by way of Kong , and speak to and honor all these influences. And I could really look at my characters, who are all uncertain of where they belong, and thrust them into this island—which should be this pure, untouched, cathartic place, and then men just destroy it! They're confronted with the unknown, and they're put back in their place down the food chain. \nThe rest is a little above my pay grade. I wish I could give definitive answers on whether we see these characters again. I think a lot depends on how the audience reacts. I'm half-joking, but the way I'd like to go back to this is a prequel where we see a young John C. Reilly fighting monsters with a katana. \nI have to give the studio a lot of credit because I was really loud and probably annoying about how audiences are fatigued on this franchise thing right now. All these movies now have these ten-minute diversions from the movie that are about a movie that doesn't even come out for another three years. It takes away from the actual story at hand to set something else up. Our movie is laying groundwork and setting up a few things, but I feel very fortunate we don't have these weird tangents that are 100% unrelated to the film we're making. \nEven the title, Skull Island —this is an isolation film. You're dropped into the thick of it and it would be weird to be taken out of that setting even briefly. Absolutely. You know how I compared it to Aliens ? People go into this environment, shit goes wrong. What does this experience do to people? What do they discover about themselves? I wanted to tell a simple story. A new story, but with the iconography and the pillars that people love about the Kong mythology. Hopefully people will walk out of this movie thinking, That wasn't the Kong or monster movie I was expecting, but a weird, fun adventure movie. \nYour next movie might be Metal Gear Solid . Can you tell us a little about that? I'm working on that as we speak. Whether or not that's the next thing totally depends on a billion different stars aligning. But my love and passion for that franchise goes back to my childhood. I would love to make it. I hope it's something we can do. \nThat or the John C. Reilly katana movie. [ Laughs ] Yeah, you know, I'm probably going to go off and make another experimental, indie movie by myself first and then come back to Hollywood. Maybe I'll sleep for a year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:30:12.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
