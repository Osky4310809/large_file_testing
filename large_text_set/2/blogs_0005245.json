The Ukrainian police have done nothing – they’re not going to do anything now, especially with the corruption we’re facing from some of them out there.” \nSpelling out his determination to get to the bottom of what happened, he added: “I don’t think she realised the quiet brother down in Devon, the country bumpkin married for 30-odd years, would take this on like we did. She totally underestimated us.” \nThe inquest in Exeter ruled millionaire Barry was “tricked” into standing in the road just moments before the car – with no lights on and stolen number plates – smashed into him. \nThe inquest heard claims that Ziuzina left him standing there after going back to a restaurant to retrieve a dropped glove. \nPeter Clifford, best man at the couple’s Kiev wedding, told the inquest: “There is no reasonable doubt in my mind that Barry was murdered, nor is there any reasonable doubt in my mind Ganna Ziuzina either arranged for, or was complicit in, his murder.” Barry's brother Shaughan Pring is determined to get to the bottom of what happened (Photo: PA) \nAnd Barry’s mum Irene said: “We are sure Ganna had some involvement in Barry’s death in order to inherit money or property.” \nZiuzina was granted legal aid to fight for assets from Barry’s estate. She is now in Marbella with British property and fashion mogul Ivan Lister, 48, and their daughter, three. \nBarry met Ziuzina online in 2006. They wed in January 2007 and she was pictured lazing by a pool at his parents’ home later that year. \nBarry was killed outside Kiev shortly after his first wedding anniversary. \nAhead of the inquest, Devon and Cornwall Police said Ziuzina was “probably” in Spain. The media traced her on Friday.

Certain members are corrupt. Certain members are totally incompetent. It’s only because we pursued it that they reluctantly started to do something.” \nHe also accused the Foreign Office of dragging its heels – though former Prime Minister David Cameron did write to Ukrainian authorities in 2013. \nShaughan called on current PM Theresa May to pile further pressure on Kiev. He said: “The British Government need to demand that our police take the case over.” \nA spokesman for the Foreign Office said: “We have provided support and advice since 2008. Our sympathies remain with the family at this difficult time.” Anna Ziuzina is believed to romantically involved with British property and fashion mogul Ivan Lister (Photo: Rob Todd/Daily Mail/SOLO Syndication) \nZiuzina has previously said she gave three statements to police in Ukraine and did not “believe I can add anything further”. \nBut Shaughan said the family would only be happy when Barry’s killer was jailed. \nHe added: “That’s the only time we’ll get closure.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:41:59.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
