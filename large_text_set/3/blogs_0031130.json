Lynch (MA) to the White House. Yet, the congressman did not accept , offering this blunt explanation to the Boston Globe . \n“I was asked if I would be interested in going over to the White House for a meeting,” Lynch said in a statement to the Globe. “They said they were looking for ‘moderate’ Democrats – which I am. But under the circumstances I felt like they were trying to divide our party so I declined the invitation.” “My feeling is that the Trump White House has taken a ‘scorched earth’ approach so far,” he added. “I am usually someone who looks for middle ground, but Mr. Trump’s opening position, especially as reflected in his budget, has been so extreme that there is no middle ground. It’s a non-starter for me.” \nAt least he tried? \nOther Democrats have been able to at least stomach a conversation with the president. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) met with Trump earlier this month and even found common ground with him regarding the need to bring down drug prices. \nLynch was one of several Democrats who received a formal invitation to meet with Trump. We'll see if others follow his lead and check the \"Not Interested\" box. \nIt was a tense election cycle and Democrats are still bitter about the result, but is refusing to step foot near the White House really beneficial to the country?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:24:42.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
