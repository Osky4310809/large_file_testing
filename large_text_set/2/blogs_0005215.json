Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. \n“Once an unelected bureaucrat unfairly adds these folks to the federal background check system, they are no longer able to exercise their Second Amendment right,” he added. \nThe bill eliminating the gun rule now needs approval from the Senate.   \nLikewise, the GOP-controlled Senate issued a final approval to eliminate an Obama-era regulation known as the “stream rule” that had prevented coal-mine debris from being dumped into streams near mine sites. \nNote that the senators did not revoke this rule because they hate streams. But as Luke Popovich, vice president of external communications for the National Mining Association, wrote in a blog post last month, the “stream rule” is a job-killing measure that put federal bureaucrats at the Office of Surface Mining in charge of decisions that should be handled by the states or other federal agencies. \n“The stream rule is to bad regulations what the Sistine Chapel is to Renaissance art,” Popovich wrote. “It’s a pure expression of all that ordinary Americans loathe about rule by bureaucracy.” \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also expressed displeasure in the rule, arguing it would threaten coal jobs and damage communities in coal-producing states — like Kentucky.
