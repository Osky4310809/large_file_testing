Something to think about for everyone that argued a version of: 1. “Trump can’t do what he says.”(The Constitution, Checks and Balances, Congress Hates Him) 2. “Trump won’t do what he says.” (So you stumped for someone you admit is a teller of tall tales) 3. “But Hillary is more dangerous, scary, has a private email server, some other woman-based pejorative. (At least I didn’t see the stuff I have seen on friends’ Red newsfeeds that she is a witch, pedophile, etc. I have a mostly Blue feed with a few atheist libertarians and conservatives and outright trolls) …are now the least of our worries. (Image/ Imgur ) 4. “Trump is an atheist or not a theocrat.”(Who is pulling his strings?) 5. “Trump just says mean, unpopular, and or stupid words” (Those words are now enforced by the federal government. That leaves the mostly middle-class and below taxpayer with the bill for his border wall. Yay! Your taxes at work for a future piece of crumbling infrastructure. Not to mention the damage his words signed into executive orders are already doing to science, free speech, equality, you name it.) 6. I am sure I left out a few of the other chestnuts used to justify Trump votes and from non-voters. \nAron Ra and I still argue with a few of these people when we talk about the remedies to the damage Trump is doing. Any former Trump Stumper or Clinton False Equivocator would be worthy of respect if they would admit they were wrong and be part of the solution. It’s not like nonbelievers have a doctrinal obligation like the solidly Trump supporting Evangelicals to eschew liberal lies from Satan. On that note, there are independent, fact-checking sources on Trump. Politifact is one that fact-checks all political parties. \nPublic contrition might actually help to undo some of the damage. Here is the damage your average taxpayer is footing the bill for in the first 4 days and counting. (Hat tip to blogger Deanna Adams of Musings on a Limb for reposting it.) \nA drumroll please!“Those who study authoritarian regimes suggest keeping a list of abnormal events after a demagogue is elected, as a way to remind yourself that this isn’t normal and to keep from being overwhelmed into acceptance by the onslaught of attacks on our rights. Here is a list below. We are 4 days in. As the author says, “when you see all of this in one list, it is easy to get overwhelmed, at first– it is also easy to see a pattern and to finally, finally recognize that none of this is normal, nor is it ok.” * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the DOJ’s Violence Against Women programs. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Minority Business Development Agency. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Economic Development Administration. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the International Trade Administration. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Legal Services Corporation. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the DOJ. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Office of Electricity Deliverability and Energy Reliability. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. * On January 19th, 2017, DT said that he would cut funding for the Office of Fossil Energy. * On January 20th, 2017, DT ordered all regulatory powers of all federal agencies frozen. * On January 20th, 2017, DT ordered the National Parks Service to stop using social media after RTing factual, side by side photos of the crowds for the 2009 and 2017 inaugurations. * On January 20th, 2017, roughly 230 protestors were arrested in DC and face unprecedented felony riot charges.
