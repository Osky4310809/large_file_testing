It was a decision that I took heavily over a period of time and one which came about after years of unhappiness,” she said. \n“Luckily I was persuaded to seek medical help and I duly went to the doctors where I asked to be voluntarily sectioned. Instead I was put on a care plan, given antidepressants and offered therapy,” she continued on Sky News discussion show The Pledge.

I didn’t talk to anyone because I didn’t realise I had an issue,” she said. \n“I didn’t just wake up one morning and think, ‘This is the day I commit suicide.’ I was desperately unhappy. I just knew I wanted to end my own life. It got to the point when I thought, I can’t carry on like this,” she told The Sun on Sunday .

I thought I was a burden, I was in deep pain. I was desperate. the thought of ending my life was constant for months. So one day I just knew I had to go round to my mum’s in Hull and I told her I was on the edge of killing myself. She was devastated.” \nBut it was that talk with her mum that saved Michelle’s life. \nThe presenter explained how her mum’s intervention made her book a doctor’s appointment, which led her to understand she’d been suffering depression for years. \nMichelle said: “She was my rock, my guardian angel. It was a talk with her that made me realise that I had depression. I was very lucky.” Michelle now works with people struggling with depression (Photo: PA) Read More Where are The Apprentices now?

She spoke out about her own experiences in a bid to combat what she sees as a stigma surrounding mental health. \n“I remain grateful for that intervention because it literally saved my life but it only happened after I decided to talk and if people felt less embarrassed or ashamed, less worried about their jobs, reactions of family and friends, more people would be able to talk,” she added on The Pledge. \n“This stigma about mental health need to end now because it is literally killing people.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:55:04.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
