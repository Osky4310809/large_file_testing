The students streamed on to the court. \nAll of this happened right in front of my eyes, in an arena near and dear to my heart, on a night I’d circled weeks earlier in the event of just this very thing happening. \nAnd all I could think to tweet was a mild profanity. Dererk Pardon was the recipient of the fateful pass, getting this clean look for the win David Banks-USA TODAY Sports \nI came on a whim. \nA little over two weeks ago, after my alma mater Northwestern went on the road and upset a Top 10 Wisconsin team, I thought to myself … man. I think they’re actually going to do this. \nI looked at the remaining schedule and pinpointed a March 1 home game against Michigan as potentially the night the Wildcats might wrap up that Thing We Don’t Speak Of. I convinced my editors to send me. I booked a flight from San Jose to Chicago. \nNorthwestern promptly lost three of its next four. Some of my pessimistic alumni friends began panicking. They asked me if Northwestern would still make it if it didn’t win another game. I said that’d be dangerous. \nBut hey — just one more win will do it. Any one will do. \nOn Tuesday night, I arrived in Evanston. People told me it’s been an unusually mild winter here. I landed to cold and heavy rain. \nBad omen? \nUpon checking into my downtown hotel, I noticed a sign for a Northwestern basketball “meeting” that night. Apparently this was where the team stays the night before the game. I got on an elevator, it stopped on the second floor and in walked … head coach Chris Collins. Northwestern head coach Chris Collins said the team had never practiced the winning play David Banks-USA TODAY Sports \nGood omen? \nOn Wednesday, I visited with a few people (including football coach Pat Fitzgerald) before heading over to Welsh-Ryan Arena several hours early. The 35-year-old eyesore of a building — which will be torn up beginning next week — smelled exactly the same as it did when I was a student in the mid-‘90s. \nMostly like popcorn. Or, as my friend Teddy Greenstein of the Chicago Tribune puts it, “like dreams unfulfilled.” \nI sat there in the near-empty arena and thought about all those nights here in college covering teams that went 7-20 and 7-22. The football team had just made its Cinderella run to the Rose Bowl. They did it with an 85-man roster. My friends and I wondered, how hard can it be to recruit five decent basketball players? \nAnd we kept wondering it for another 20 years. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, a former Northwestern attendee, showed up for Wednesday’s game with husband Brad Hall David Banks-USA TODAY Sports \nBut on the scale of Northwestern basketball suffering, my 40-year-old buddies actually had it relatively easy. Before the game, I wandered around interviewing fans that looked like maybe they’d been coming here for a lot longer. \nI met Steve Wilson, class of 1970 and major donor to the program. He’s been coming to these games for 51 years. Imagine following a basketball team for 51 years that’s barely even played in the NIT. “I bleed purple,” he said. \nI met Tom and Mary Spiering, who drive 60 miles from Urban Grove, Wis., for every home game. They are not alums themselves but got hooked when their daughters went to school here. “I’ve been nervous all day,” Tom lamented. “Just keep hoping. You can shoot me dead, but, just let them win.” \nAnd I met Jon Newcomb, class of ’79, who told me lately the wait between games had become agonizing. “I pull up every bracketology column I can find and try to convince myself I can make it to game time.” Wildcats forward Vic Law David Banks-USA TODAY Sports \nI asked him what he thought that moment would be like come Selection Sunday if in fact Northwestern’s name finally flashes on the screen. \n“Well, I’m going to say ‘When’ … when it happens,” he said. “It’s going to be one of the great moments of my life, right up there with the day I married my wife, the birth of my children and Michigan beating Ohio State [in 1995] to send us to the Rose Bowl.” \nThis was about 10 minutes before tipoff. I looked up and suddenly noticed — whoa. This place is packed. \nIn my day, there were games when I was covering the team for the student paper that I was the only student I knew there. On Wednesday, the first students ran to their seats as soon as the doors opened. One, Jake Schaefer, a senior from Chicago, had his face painted purple while wearing a Phantom of the Opera hat. An entire row of students behind one basket had their shirts off and chests painted with purple letters. (I never did figure out what they were trying to spell.) \nTickets were going for $160 on StubHub. For a Northwestern basketball game. There was a time when you probably could have bought a season ticket for less. \nIt was all so … surreal.
