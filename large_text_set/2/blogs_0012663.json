He raised the instability of the party and its poor choice of candidates in relation to who would replace former Senator Rod Culleton. \nOnly a week ago Premier Barnett stated in an interview that \"When we've seen minor parties, sometimes with an odd assortment of candidates, it makes government very, very difficult.\" \nNow Premier Barnett is prepared to help elect the sort of candidates he warned against ahead of National Party members he has shared government with for more than eight years. \nWhen One Nation has debuted at past elections, it has always been the Coalition parties that have suffered. The table below sets out what happened to Labor and Coalition first preference support at past debut elections by One Nation. Changes in Party Support at One Nation 'Debut' Elections -11.1 9.6 \nAt every One Nation debut election, the party's vote was matched by a huge decline in first preference support for the Liberal and National parties. \nMuch of that change was a direct switch of first preference support from the Coalition to One Nation. Some was a switch of Labor voters to One Nation, but Labor's vote was bolstered by Coalition voters deserting to Labor. \nWhatever the path of vote switching, the result was bad news for the Coalition. \nMost damaging for the Coalition in the final three elections listed above was that having lost first preference support, the Coalition was damaged by the the even split of One Nation preferences. Having apparently lost so many first preference votes, the Coalition failed to receive those votes back as further preferences. \nThe Liberal and National parties have advocated putting One Nation last on how-to-vote material at every election with the exception of One Nation's first contest at the 1998 Queensland election. \nAs the 1998 Queensland election approached, the Borbidge Coalition government realised the only way the National and Liberal Parties could win re-election was by recommending preferences to One Nation in the hope of encouraging One Nation voters to direct preferences back to the Coalition. \nThe decision certainly worked in terms of preference flows. The 1998 Queensland election is the only election where One Nation preferences heavily favoured the Nationals and Liberals. \nThe problem was the decision benefited One Nation as much as the Borbidge government. \nAt the time Nationals Senator Bill O'Chee was scathing of media questions on whether the decision would see National preferences elect One Nation MPs. National preferences would not need to be distributed O'Chee asserted, a claim that proved to be wildly inaccurate. \nThe National Party vote was savaged in its rural Queensland heartland, its candidates pushed into third place by One Nation. Three senior National Party MPs, Russell Cooper, Doug Slack and Len Stephan, only made it back into parliament thanks to Labor's decision to preference the Nationals ahead of One Nation. \nThe 1998 Queensland election was not a state wide contest. Only 52 of the 89 seats finished as traditional Labor versus Coalition contests. There were 22 Labor versus One Nation contests where National and Liberal candidates slipped to third place and had their preferences distributed. There were also 13 National versus One Nation contests and two seats won by Independents. \nThe election was conducted under optional preferential voting, but in 1998 most parties still distributed how to vote material recommending full preferences. Labor's 'Just Vote 1' strategy did not begin until the 2001 election, so 1998 preference flows had lower exhaustion rates than elections since. \nThere were 29 seats where One Nation candidates were distributed last in Labor-Liberal contests, with preferences flowing 47.3% to Liberal, 23.7% to Labor and 29.0% exhausted. In 15 Labor-National contests, One Nation preferences flowed 50.3% to National, 18.7% to Labor and 31.0% exhausted. \nThere were eight seats where Liberal preferences were distributed producing flows of 52.2% to One Nation, 22.6% to Labor and 25.2% exhausted. In the 14 seats where National preferences were distributed they flowed 60.8% to One Nation, 19.1% to Labor and 20.l% exhausted. \nThere were 12 electorates where Labor preferences were distributed, with Labor preferences flowing 46.2% to the Coalition, 17.9% to One Nation and 35.9% exhausted. \nThe exhaustion rates complicate projecting possible preference flows for Western Australia. However it does suggest the Liberal Party might get two-thirds or more of One Nation preferences on 11 March compared to the even preference splits that have occurred where One Nation was put last. \nBut at what cost for future stable government? \nIn 1998 the Borbidge government went into the election governing in a hung parliament with 44 Coalition seats, 44 Labor seats and one Independent. \nThe result was a mess with contests across the state where the bronze medalist determined who won gold and silver. Where One Nation finished third preference flowed to the Coalition, though results tended to reflect an overall two-party preferred swing. Labor's own seats were at risk in seats where the Nationals finished third, and the Nationals were forced to rely on Labor preferences to win seats where Labor finished third. \nAfter preferences there was a 4.6% swing to Labor where One Nation finished third, a 3.0% swing against Labor where One nation finished second, and a 16.2% swing against the Nationals where Labor finished third. \nLabor gained six seats from the Liberal Party in traditional two-party contests, but lost six of its own seats to One Nation on National Party preferences. One Nation gained five National Party seats and could have won another three were it not for Labor's decision to recommend preferences for the Nationals. \nOut of this electoral chaos, Labor ended up one seat short of a majority due to the Nationals helping One Nation win seats. But that also left the Coalition well short of any ability to govern. Preferencing One Nation may have made life more difficulty for Labor's Peter Beattie to form government, but it made it impossible for the Coalition to form government. (Beattie eventually formed government with Independent support.) \nThree years later, the Beattie government won a landslide re-election with the line that the only alternative to a Labor government was a ramshackle coalition of National, Liberal and One Nation. \nFor all the talk that conservatives need to tap into the resurgence of the right created by One Nation's return, the issue is how conservatives interested in stable government can ride the wild tiger of conservative populism. \nAn incident in the last week of the 1998 Queensland election encapsulates the problem. \nOne of the biggest political issues of 1998 was the Howard government's amendments to the Native Title Act to remove uncertainty created by the Wik judgement. \nPremier Rob Borbidge did his best to argue Howard's case in the Queensland election. In the last week of the campaign he flew to the state's north-west to visit the Century Zinc Mine, a project being held up by delays in resolving Native Title. The story was to highlight how his government could work with the Howard government to resolve these issues where Labor couldn't. \nBy the time Borbidge returned to Brisbane his story had been bumped down the evening news bulletins by Pauline Hanson, who rejected any dealing with the Wik Amendments and simply asserted the Native Title Act should be repealed. Her statement led the evening news, drowning out Borbidge's message. \nThe week after the Queensland election, the Howard government backed down on the four contentious points of its 10 point Wik plan and claimed victory. Within weeks Mr Howard also announced his GST plans and switched the entire focus of his government on to its strongest selling point, its handling of the economy and tax reform since coming to office. \nThis is the difficulty that Colin Barnett will now face in Western Australia. Every time a One Nation candidate comes out with a wild claim on an issue, Premier Barnett will be asked why he thinks it is good to help such a candidate win election. \nIt is a problem that the Queensland LNP will also face at the state election likely to be held this year. A preference deal with One Nation might stop Labor winning the election, but at a cost of the LNP having to try and govern with One Nation holding the balance of power. \nThe re-emergence of One Nation has been put forward by some as a local manifestation of the UK's Brexit vote or the election of President Trump. \nTo me it has strong undertones of being a repeat of One Nation's first emergence in 1998, and the 'Joh For PM' push a decade earlier. It is just another cry that conservative politics in Australia is not conservative enough. \nIt creates a terrible dilemma for Australia's most conservative mainstream party, the Nationals, who once again face being crunched by those who think they are better conservatives.
