There used to be more. \nIt is not just the name -- part Roman poet, part Dutchman -- that makes him stand out. Virgil van Dijk has a capacity to catch the eye. He's a centre-back with the technical ability of a midfielder, a defiant defender who can pop up anywhere on the pitch, a charismatic figure who seems to exert a magnetic effect on the ball. He is the Southampton player with most tackles, clearances, interceptions, bookings and red cards. \nVan Dijk is normally conspicuous by his presence. When Southampton host Arsenal on Saturday, his ankle injury could mean he is conspicuous by his absence. He is the odd man out, separated by his teammates as the lone remaining genuine \"top six\" player at St Mary's, a footballer who would get in the team at most (if not all) of England's elite clubs. \nSteven Gerrard has suggested Liverpool should sign him; others think Manchester City ought to while, fancifully or otherwise, Manchester United and Chelsea have been linked with him. As arguably the finest centre-back in the Premier League this season, he would get in any of their teams. But his current colleagues would not. \nIf one other Saint would merit a spot in a side with Champions League aspirations, it's because of a weakness on their part rather than his own excellence. Fraser Forster seems a better goalkeeper than Claudio Bravo; some would prefer him to either Simon Mignolet or Loris Karius, the Liverpool pair. Yet a visit to St Mary's in previous seasons would have revealed more players in red and white with the quality to excel at a higher level. It is why nine of them were lured to bigger clubs over the past three summers. \nAnd Van Dijk is an anomaly, both in Claude Puel's side and a division composed of two increasingly distanced groups: the best and the rest. Last season was remarkable for the rise of the upstarts, epitomised by Leicester's incredible title win. What has been notable this season is the manner in which the established order have reasserted their authority. It has been reflected in the transfer market: The big sides have simply cherry-picked footballers and enfeebled rival teams in the process. \nThree players from the ambitious \"middle class clubs\" have had transformative effects in grander surroundings. The most obvious example is N'Golo Kante, well on his way to securing back-to-back titles for himself; Chelsea struggled before his arrival while Leicester haven't yet been able to replace him. Also, two of van Dijk's former teammates spring to mind: Victor Wanyama has cemented his spot in the Tottenham team while Liverpool look a lesser side when Sadio Mane is missing. \nIt's pragmatic purchasing on the title chasers' part, strengthening themselves while weakening a rival at the same time. And it's part of a bigger picture. Alexis Nunes and Steve Nicol dig into the latest crop of transfer rumours emerging from the January window. \nApart from van Dijk, there aren't many others at the mid-ranking or relegation-threatened clubs who deserve a place in the starting 11 of the division's super six. One who might, Dimitri Payet, seems set to leave West Ham for other, more personal reasons. If Riyad Mahrez can recapture the form that made PFA Player of the Year last season, he would exit but many of his title-winning teammates seem to have reverted to earlier levels. \nJamie Vardy, subject of a summer bid from Arsenal, is starting to look a one-season wonder. Perhaps only Kasper Schmeichel and Mahrez may gravitate to modern-day \"big\" clubs. It leaves more and more meetings between teams where none of one side would get into the other. \nThe only real exception, as the league table indicates, is Everton, trapped in no-man's land between the best and the rest, and with a group of players in Romelu Lukaku, Ross Barkley, Leighton Baines, Seamus Coleman and Ashley Williams who have attracted interest from their six superiors in the past -- and, in some cases, may do so again. \nWhile it is hard to deem his move as a success just yet, John Stones was lured to Manchester City. Once again, the top six paid to raid their challengers. But another Merseyside-Manchester transfer is revealing. \nMidfielder Morgan Schneiderlin swapped United for Everton. He belongs in the bracket of footballers who demonstrate that the league has strength in depth and quality throughout. But they are not good enough, or were not fortunate enough, to earn a regular spot in a top side. With a different manager, an extended opportunity or a style of play that suited him, perhaps he might prove the exception. \nThe same might be said of footballers like Christian Benteke, Wilfried Zaha and Joe Allen who, in their different ways, found life as a squad player unfulfilling. So did some of midtable's more gifted individuals, like Stoke duo Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri, have the ability to operate at a more elevated level, yet it is hard to claim they would command a place at any of the six pacesetters. There are reasons they are found at Stoke. \nThe clinical finishing of Jermain Defoe in Sunderland or the exuberance of West Ham's Michail Antonio may still attract covetous glances. Yet they would be enterprising options, not automatic selections. Ultimately, it illustrates why van Dijk is different, a rarity among the rest in that he is good enough to walk into one of the best teams. And when he goes, as he surely will, the gap between the top six and everyone else should widen even further. \nRichard Jolly covers the Premier League and Champions League for ESPN FC.
