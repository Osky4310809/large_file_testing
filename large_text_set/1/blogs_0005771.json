Russell Wilson floated one, and Richardson found a way to come down with it.\nPass interference was called on Lions safety Tavon Wilson, so the catch stood. But it definitely appears that Richardson had a good hold on Wilson’s facemask, which went uncalled.\nHad that been called, the penalties would have been offsetting, but instead the Seahawks were rewarded with a touchdown that’s going to be discussed for some time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:49:04.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
