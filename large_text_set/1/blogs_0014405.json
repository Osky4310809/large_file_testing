Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors beat Al Ain to win the 2016 Asian Champions League The winners of last season's Asian Champions League have been kicked out of the 2017 competition following a bribery scandal. \nSouth Korea's Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors beat Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates in November to win the competition. \nBut the Asian Football Confederation has barred Jeonbuk from next year's tournament after a club scout was found guilty of bribing referees in 2014. \nJeonbuk said they will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \nThe club missed out on this year's K-League title after being docked nine points by their domestic federation in September. \nJeju United, the team that finished third in the 2016 K-League, will take Jeonbuk's place in the Asian Champions League. \nTake part in our Premier League Predictor game, which allows you to create leagues with friends.
