A written complaint was submitted to the flight captain against the accused – a 23-year-old hardware trader. According to a Times of India report, the accused – Akash Gupta – was handed over to the CISF on landing, and he has been charged with section 354 – outraging the modesty of a woman. The incident reportedly took place when the air hostesses were serving him his in-flight meal. He reportedly grabbed their hands forcing them to seek help from the cabin crew members. When they tried to stop him, Gupta argued with them too, following which the captain was informed. \nGupta, it is being said, is a native of Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh. The CISF handed him over to Sonegaon police. He was produced in court on Sunday, and sent to magisterial custody. This is not the first time that such incident has been reported. Last year, a 29-year-old man from Gujarat was arrested for allegedly molesting an air hostess onboard a Mumbai-bound flight from Dammam in Saudi Arabia. \nThe incident took place on Jet Airways flight 9W 563. The accused, identified as Mohamad Ambudkar was traveling from Saudi Arabia and during the entire journey, he forcefully tried to take a selfie with an air hostess, according to officials. Ambudkar also smoked a cigarette inside the washroom of the aircraft. \nYou may also like to watch: \nUpon landing at the city airport here, he was handed over to the police after immigration checks, he said.
