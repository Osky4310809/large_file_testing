But, when it comes to their own privacy, actors do put up with flashing cameras in their faces almost every time they step out. It's one thing to want to take pictures of grown ups, but journalists really need to step back when it comes to their kids. \nShahid and Mira Kapoor have often been clicked at the airport, during their travels. But, this time around, the journalists crossed a line when they tried to capture Misha. The Kapoors are always protective of their baby girl, and whenever they step out in public with her, they make sure to cover her up. So, this stunt did not go down well with Shahid, who slammed them with this tweet: Unfortunate how some journos don't realise how bad 20 cameras flashing 2 feet away are for an infants eyes. No common sense in their dna. — Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) January 5, 2017 Picture Credits: BCCL", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T09:52:26.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
