The 42-year-old actress apologized on Thursday's episode of The Talk after mispronouncing several names during the show's live announcement of Emmy nominations on Wednesday.

I respect you guys, I congratulate you. I would never want to take away from your moment, so I am truly sorry,\" she continued. \"I wish you guys luck, and again, I apologize, and we celebrate you guys.\" Gilbert's on-air flubs (which included names like The View 's Sara Haines, Jedediah Bila and Sunny Hostin, and The Real 's Adrienne Houghton and Jeannie Mai) didn't go unnoticed. In fact, Whoopi Goldberg called Gilbert out on The View on Thursday. \"I think [the nominations] were announced on The Talk and I think a couple of the women weren't sure about the pronunciation of everyone's names so please introduce yourself so people know,\" Goldberg said, prompting her castmates to pronounce their own names.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:39:04.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
