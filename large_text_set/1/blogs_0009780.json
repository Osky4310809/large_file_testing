We are concerned that this comingling of religion and athletics results, not from student initiative, but rather from the attitudes and the unconstitutional behaviors of the coaching staff,” the letter continued, claiming that Swinney had brought on a chaplain and demanding change. \nYou might think that the university, like virtually every other university, would bow down to demands from the left in the name of inclusiveness. But National Review reported that not only did Swinney refuse to back down, but the university stood behind him. \nHe said in a statement to WYFF at the time: “(1) Players must go to class, (2) they must give a good effort, and (3) they must be good citizens,” and then he followed that up by saying that “Recruiting is very personal.   \n“Recruits and their families want — and deserve — to know who you are as a person, not just what kind of coach you are. I try to be a good example to others, and I work hard to live my life according to my faith.” \nIn other words, he’s going to love Jesus publicly and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. \nThis is amazing. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about Swinney’s action!
