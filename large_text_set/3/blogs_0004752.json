When Rupert (playing Ron Weasley) appears to momentarily lose his lines, Watson steps in to help.\n“You laugh, this is actually quite traumatic for me because I created issues because of this,” she said after being shown the clip. “Yes, I would ruin takes. [Director] Chris [Columbus] would be like, “Cut. Emma, you’re doing it again. You’re mouthing Dan’s lines,’ and I’d be like, ‘Ooo, I’m so sorry, so sorry. Oh, I feel so bad.’ But I couldn’t help myself.”\nWatch the clip above, and after you’ve finished, check out the six new original Netflix shows you’ll be binge-watching next .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:28:17.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
