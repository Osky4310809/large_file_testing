Now in her 60s, she’s finally getting the recognition she deserves Lubaina Himid among the cutouts of slaves that form her 2004 piece Naming the Money, at Spike Island contemporary art centre in Bristol.

It was 1954 and her Blackpool-born mother decided to leave their home in Zanzibar and head back to Britain, where she brought her daughter up as a Londoner. Himid would not return to the place of her birth for 43 years. \nSo for much of her early career, Himid painted a kind of homeland of the imagination. Her theatrical, large-scale works were populated by sturdy, redoubtable women and characterised by scorching, oven-baked colours. “I think I was always trying to paint Zanzibar somehow,” says Himid, now an energetic woman in her early 60s. “I was always trying to live it in my head.” \nWhat stopped her going back? Money, of course, and her lack of Swahili. But there was something else: “Fear, in some senses. When we left, my father had just died and that turmoil and the fear of it never really left me.” She finally summoned up the courage to make the trip with her friend, the artist Maud Sulter , in 1997. “When I went, it was easy of course – because I was home, bizarrely.” \nThe paintings she made immediately after that trip stand apart from her other work. Abstract, in watery plaster pinks and crow’s egg blues, they are stained with dripmarks as if their whole surface has been weeping. “They are absolutely covered with tears, these paintings,” she says. “When I went, I spent a lot of time regretting not having gone back sooner.” \nPainted as diptychs the size of the cotton kangas worn in east Africa, the Zanzibar paintings wrap around two sides of Navigation Charts, Himid’s forthcoming retrospective at Spike Island in Bristol. It is one of two substantial shows of her work this spring, the other being at Modern Art Oxford . Both coincide with The Place Is Here , an expansive exploration of the work of black British artists and thinkers during the 1980s, which takes place at Nottingham Contemporary.

The V&A has a fabulous portrait of her by Maud Sulter from the time. Himid is dressed as an African Urania, the muse of astronomy. She looks knowing, sweet-faced yet also stern. \nSince moving to Preston in the 1990s to pursue an academic career, Himid has amassed an archive of documents relating to black visual artists from the 80s to the present day. Some will be at Nottingham alongside A Fashionable Marriage, a work she made in 1986. Echoing a scene from Hogarth’s Marriage à la Mode , the satirical work is a tableau of outsized cut-out figures dressed with paint and collage. Hogarth’s reclining countess and her buffoonish lover have become Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, flirting, with a torpedo firing from the president’s crotch. \n“What a time to be opening these shows,” says Himid. “It is bizarre. Donald Trump and Theresa May – who would have thought that, all these years later, it would be that same kind of relationship with an American clown again?” Swallow Hard: The Lancaster Dinner Service (detail), 2007.

But why this medium when so many of her contemporaries used photography or video to give their art punch? “I wasn’t really making work to confront a white audience,” she says, extolling the inviting qualities of paint. “I was making work so that other black people could come to exhibitions and be in a room with a load of black women and think, ‘Oh, this is just like me on a Saturday night or me at a wedding.’ I was trying to make places and spaces where we could see ourselves, but also where we could be seen.” \nThe main space of Spike Island is populated with 100 large-than-life cutout figures, from the 2004 work Naming the Money. There are dancers, drummers, artists, mapmakers, potters, players of the viola da gamba, dog trainers, cobblers, toy-makers and herbalists, all dressed in brightly coloured approximations of early modern dress. They were, says Himid, inspired by the slave servants of the European upper classes. \n“In La Rochelle many decades ago,” says Himid, “I saw paintings of slave servants who were gifts from the king of Spain to the king of France. Each figure had a sash across his front saying his name and what he was good at.” For her updated version, Himid has named these status symbols, first with their birth name, and secondly with a generic name allotted to servants in their position – all the dog trainers are called Sam, for example, and the ceramicists Sally. \n“You’d dress these people in the finest clothes you could because it was all about signifying wealth in Europe at that time. That was their purpose. They weren’t like American slaves: they were working for nothing, but not in fields or doing hard labour.” \nA work from the same period, Cotton.com, imagines a dialogue between cotton workers in Lancashire and slaves in the cotton fields of South Carolina. “They were living desperate lives, all those Lancashire cotton workers. But every day they were receiving material picked by this other set of people in desperate working conditions. And it was the same few people exploiting all the workers.” ‘I was trying to make places and spaces where we could see ourselves’ … Le Rodeur: Exchange, 2016.

While she has not stopped working and exhibiting in three decades, the involvement of Hollybush Gardens marked a turning point in her career. The recent interest in artists who have worked collectively – and who created pieces intended to be seen rather than, perhaps, to sell – suggests that a reappraisal of the politicised art of the 80s is under way. These shows do seem to have become, albeit coincidentally, part of a broader examination of the political and cultural cocktail of the 80s, as well as a way of using it to reflect on the present moment. \n“Sometimes these incredibly rightwing, oppressive governments can galvanise thinking,” says Himid, “and bring together actual people doing actual things.” She points out how much has changed, and at the same time how little. “On the one hand, the 1980s is all shoulderpads and loads of money. And on the other, it’s miners’ strikes and strong politics. You often get things like that going together, so I don’t give up hope.” \n• Lubaina Himid: Navigation Charts is at Spike Island, Bristol , 20 January-26 March.
