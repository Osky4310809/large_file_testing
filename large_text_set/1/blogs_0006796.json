Pammy Rose was recently crowned Miss Transgender England 2016 (Photo: Pammy Rose) The stunning 24-year-old, from Seaham, County Durham, was born as a boy named Paul Witten (Photo: Pammy Rose) \nSpeaking today, Pammy, from Seaham, County Durham, described how she never used to go on dates, fearing they would \"not go well\". \nHowever, she would sometimes meet a man on a night out with friends. \n\"I would meet a guy at a bar and he would be so nice,\" the young woman told Mirror Online. \"We would be talking and drinking...

The door would be slammed in my face or he'd say, 'I've got to go back to my friends now'.\" \nShe added that she was even spat at in one horrific encounter. \n\"One man told me he thought I was disgusting and he had been so nice,\" she said. \n\"He had anger in his eyes. I was with my friends, but God knows what could have happened if I was alone.\" Pammy says she never used to go on dates, fearing they would \"not go well\" (Photo: Pammy Rose) \nWhen she did get into a relationship with one man, Pammy said he refused to tell anyone else about her. \n\"He walked all over me, but I put up with it because I didn't think I was going to find anyone else,\" she said. \nDespite her experiences, Pammy said she is now extremely happy in her romantic life - although \"it's still early days\". \nThe keen dancer, who was recently crowned Miss Transgender England 2016, has known she was born in the wrong body since the age of four.

I also ran around the streets with a T-shirt on my head, pretending it was hair. She says she has been subjected to shocking verbal abuse and cruel behaviour by males over the past few years (Photo: Pammy Rose) \n\"As I grew up, I started to build up a lot of danger. At around the age of 11 or 12, I began to feel very alienated from the world. \n\"I didn't understand how I was different.\" \nPammy said she began wearing makeup, and then girls' clothing. \nHowever, she still didn't realise she was transgender, having grown up in a small town and with no knowledge of the term. \nAt school, she suffered horrendous bullying by her classmates. She was threatened so much that she was terrified to leave the house. \n\"I went on a taster day at a secondary school and was glued to the teacher,\" she said. \"I was called a freak and other names. \n\"At one point, the teacher walked away and a kid spat at me. When you're at that age you're especially vulnerable.\" \nShe added: \"I made up every excuse to get out of school to my mum.\" When she was a child, Pammy used to wear a T-shirt on her head, pretending it was long hair (Photo: Pammy Rose) \nPammy, who made a suicide attempt aged 13, said she was supported by her \"best friend\", her 51-year-old mum, Julie. \n\"I told my mum at around the age of four that I wanted to be a girl,\" she said. \n\"Like many parents, she probably thought I would grow out of it. But I didn't. When I was 14, I told her again that there was something not right.\" \nShe added that she eventually gained enough confidence to walk around with a full face of makeup, not caring what the bullies thought. \n\"You can't control what other people think about you so there's no reason to care,\" said Pammy, who has been dancing since the age of five. \nAged 16, Pammy started her transition into a woman. \nSeveral years later, she was entered into a beauty contest by a friend - and was stunned to discover she had made it into the finals. \n\"I went all the way through it, then when it got to the speeches, I told the organisers that I was transgender,\" she told Mirror Online. Pammy is awaiting gender reassignment surgery - and is hopeful that 2017 could bring exciting news for her (Photo: Pammy Rose) \nPammy has since won Miss Transgender England 2016 - and also scooped an award in Miss Transgender UK 2016 in Leeds, West Yorkshire. \nThe young woman - who changed her name aged 18 and has been taking hormones for years - was also the 'people's choice' winner. \n\"It was a big 'ha ha' to the people who said I didn't belong in this world,\" she said, adding that she enjoyed meeting other transgender people. \nPammy, who is currently unemployed, now runs her own Facebook page , on which she offers advice to people from across the globe. \nShe has nearly 15,000 'Likes' so far - and regularly posts videos on the site. \nShe is also awaiting gender reassignment surgery on the NHS - and is hopeful that 2017 could bring exciting news for her. \n\"I met the doctor last week and he was very positive,\" she said. \"My advice to other people would be that patience is key.\" \nTo follow Pammy on Facebook, click here .
