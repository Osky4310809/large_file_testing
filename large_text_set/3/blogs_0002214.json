Just two months away from it’s worldwide release, the galaxy’s favorite band of misfit heroes once again displayed their brand of “beautiful destruction” through never-before-seen footage of their upcoming blockbuster. ADVERTISEMENT Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) all share ample screen time as they fend off their latest intergalactic adversaries. Joining in the fray are former foes Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), along with the beamy-eyed Mantis (Pom Klementieff). The biggest reveal, meanwhile, came in the form of a bearded Kurt Russel, who left Pratt’s character in shock, after divulging he was his long-lost father. Director James Gunn, who made the original film, returns to direct the sequel and even shared the film’s latest promotional poster on Twitter. Because we love you.
