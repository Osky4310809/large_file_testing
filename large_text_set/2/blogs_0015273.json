Tweet from @RAZORX50 \nWith Air Force One optimally positioned in the background at Orlando Melbourne International Airport—despite it being only a two–hour drive from Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago resort —Trump bombastically reiterated his usual talking points as of late: fake news, the media lies (on this point, Trump sees himself as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, by the way), women voters love him , Chicago sucks, and Obama left him One. Big. Mess. Folks, you just wouldn’t even believe . \nOh, and the White House is running smoothly. “So smoothly.” \nMany of Trump’s standard zingers—particularly the ones where he promises to kick people out of the country—predictably drew a raucous response from the 9,000 people gathered at the airport hangar rally, where temperatures were in the 80s. \n“ Gang members and drug dealers who right now as I speak are being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in,” Trump bellowed. “The gang members, bad, bad people.

So unfair.” \nThe good news is that with 1,353 days left until the 2020 presidential election, there’ll be plenty of time to enjoy that “new day” that’s coming in America. Because as Trump noted, “we don’t win anymore. We’re going to start winning again.” \nWe’ll be waiting, Mr. Trump. Any day now. \nIf you missed it and just can’t get enough of Trump, here’s the entire speech, including First Lady Melania Trump’s unique rendition of the Lord’s Prayer: Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:42:11.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
