Other sightings of the meteor came in from Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Kentucky, New York and even Ontario, Canada. \nThe first sightings were reported around 1:27 a.m. CST. \nA preliminary estimated trajectory from the AMS indicated the meteor was traveling southwest to northeast before its flight ended over Lake Michigan between Sheboygan and Manitowoc, Wisconsin. \nNumerous sightings of the meteor were captured on police dashcam recordings and traffic cameras. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:11:33.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
