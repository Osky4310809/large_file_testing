Whether they latch on to it.”\nWhen Yankees phenom Gary Sanchez blasted his first major league home run at Fenway Park last Aug. 11, Sterling punctuated his round-tripper with the cringe-worthy “Gary is scary!”\nThis season, in the tradition of the “Bam-Tino” (Tino Martinez) and “Giam-bino” (Jason Giambi), Sterling plans to stamp the slugging catcher the “San-chino.”\nYour browser does not support iframes. A Matt Holliday blast will launch Sterling into song, either Irving Berlin’s “Happy Holiday” or Perry Como’s “Home for the Holidays.” When a reporter suggested Madonna’s 1983 breakout dance track “Holiday,” Sterling said he hadn’t heard it, but would take a listen and consider it.\nJohn Sterling Getty Images Hotshot Yankees prospect Clint Frazier will start the season in Triple-A, but Sterling is ready when the kid gets the call and goes yard.\n“Downtown goes Frazier!” Sterling boomed, breaking into his best Howard Cosell, an homage to George Foreman’s January 1973 KO of Smokin’ Joe Frazier in Jamaica. “All he [Clint Frazier] has to do is get up and hit home runs,” Sterling laughed.\nHe said his top-five catch-phrases include, “Robbie Cano, don’cha know?” “Jorgie juiced one!” (Jorge Posada), sing-song “The Grandy-man can!” (Curtis Granderson, in reference to the 1972 Sammy Davis Jr. hit “The Candy Man”) and “Bern, baby, bern! (Bernie Williams), a lyrical lift from The Trammps 1976 hit, “Disco Inferno.”\nBut the overwhelming fan favorite is “An A-bomb from A-Rod!”\n“That’s the one everybody does. Freddy Garcia [who pitched for the Yanks in 2011-2012] used to do it in the elevator,” Sterling recalled.\nMatt Holliday follows through on a spring-training homer. AP Sterling shook off the notion that the catch-phrases make the moment all about him.\n“People shouldn’t take this so seriously. Dean Martin used to say in his nightclub act something risqué and he’d say, ‘Just trying to have a little fun, folks.’ I want to entertain. I don’t want to do 6-foot-2, 210 pounds out of birdbath Illinois. … You get knocked, you get knocked. You gotta do what you do.”\nSterling said he’s excited about the 2017 team because of “the influx of young talent” and believes the Bombers, despite question marks in the starting rotation, will make the playoffs.\n“Bird, Sanchez and Holliday are going to be a terrific middle three and the bullpen is set and I think you’ve got to play Judge every day ,” Sterling opined. “Imagine if they had the Mets’ staff?
