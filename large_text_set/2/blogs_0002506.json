Bank of England raises growth forecast and leaves interest rates on hold - business live Read more \nAt its rate-setting meeting the Bank’s monetary policy committee, led by governor Mark Carney, voted unanimously to hold interest rates at the record low of 0.25% and to continue with a programme of electronic money printing known as quantitative easing. That was as City economists had expected. \nBut minutes from the meeting revealed that some members of the nine-strong committee were growing more worried about inflation, which has been rising as the weak pound pushes up the costs of imports to the UK. The Bank’s forecast for inflation, however, was little changed from its last outlook in November. \nThe statement on policymakers’ inflation worries and the much stronger growth forecast are likely to leave investors scrambling to bring forward their bets on UK interest rate rises. \nThe minutes noted that consumer spending in particular had been stronger than had been expected shortly after the vote to leave, when the Bank had stepped in with an interest rate cut and more QE to shore up confidence . \nIn the wake of the referendum it has faced the balancing act of safeguarding growth and jobs while being careful that very loose borrowing conditions do not allow inflation to rise too quickly. \nCarney has repeatedly asserted that the Bank is comfortable letting inflation go above the government-set target of 2% to protect jobs but that there are limits to how far an overshoot can be tolerated. \nThe minutes to the latest rate-setting meeting noted an important shift for some policymakers. \n“At this meeting, all members agreed that it remained appropriate to maintain the stance of monetary policy. All members also agreed that, while the committee needed to continue balancing the prospect of a period of above-target inflation with the support that monetary policy gave for activity and employment, there were limits to the degree to which above-target inflation could be tolerated,” the minutes said. \n“For some members, the risks around the trade-off embodied in the central projection meant they had moved a little closer to those limits.” \nThe key forecast changes in the latest “inflation report” are: \n• The UK economy is now expected to grow 2% in 2017, compared with a November forecast of 1.4%. In its final forecasts before the referendum, in May last year, the Bank had forecast 2.3% for 2017. \n• The economy is expected to grow 1.6% in 2018, compared with 1.5% forecast in November. The forecast for 2019 is 1.7%, versus 1.6% forecast in November. \n• Taken together, the upgrades to previous forecasts amount to 1% over three years \n• Inflation to be 2.0% this quarter, 2.7% in early 2018 and 2.6% in early 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 1.8%, 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. \n• Unemployment forecasts have been revised down. Expected to be 4.9% this quarter, 5.0% in early 2018 and 5.0% in early 2019. That compares with November forecasts of 5.0%, 5.5% and 5.6%, respectively. \nThe Bank said the relatively benign outlook for inflation reflected in part its view that wages would not be pushed up as much as it previously thought by unemployment being so low. On the rosier growth outlook, it listed several factors, including government spending plans announced by Philip Hammond. \n“The upgraded outlook over the forecast period reflects the fiscal stimulus announced in the chancellor’s autumn statement, firmer momentum in global activity, higher global equity prices and more supportive credit conditions, particularly for households,” the Bank said.
