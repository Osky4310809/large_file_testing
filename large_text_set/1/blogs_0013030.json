Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHenrikh Mkhitaryan barely got a kick in the first three months of the season but his Manchester United career exploded into life in December. \nIt was unclear why Jose Mourinho used the talented Armenian so sparingly up until November, but his early season struggles now seem a distant memory as he has made United's right wing spot his own with a series of impressive displays. \nMkhitaryan has scored three goals for United to date; all of them in December and all of them utterly magnificent. \nSo good they were, that the 27-year-old placed first, second AND third in United's Goal of the Month competition. \nHis first, a solo strike in the Europa League away to Zorya Luhansk, showcased his superb dribbling ability, while his second, an unerring finish against Tottenham in the Premier League, was a perfect demonstration of his ruthlessness in front of goal. Mkhitaryan's first goal for United came in the Europa League against Zorya Luhansk... (Photo: Pro Sports Images Ltd) ... and he followed that up just days later with his first Premier League strike against Spurs (Photo: Matthew Peters) \nMkhitaryan's third effort of the month, his scorpion kick against Sunderland, unsurprisingly topped the fan vote, with 79 per cent of supporters deeming that to be United's best goal of the month. \nThe individual effort against Zorya came second with nine per cent of the vote and Mkhitaryan's goal against Spurs garnered four per cent of the vote. \nMkhitaryan also came second to Zlatan Ibrahimovic in United's Player of the Month competition for December.
