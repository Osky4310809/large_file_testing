I'm kind of a wait and see guy,\" he said, adding he hopes Trump appoints three good judges to the Supreme Court. \n\"I do think it is miraculous that God can use a man that is viewed as very secular ... to help us as Christians to be able to have a platform, to once again have our views be noticed as being important.\" \nGordon Erickson, 53, a Roman Catholic from the upper peninsula of Michigan, traveled to the Washington with a student group for the experience of viewing an inauguration. He voted for Hillary Clinton in November and was less than enthused about the new president. \n\"I'm kind of worried,\" Erickson said. \"But I don't want to judge the man. I want to give him a chance,\" adding that he hailed from a very rural part of the state and Trump visited just 100 miles away from him. \n\"He barnstormed everywhere,\" Erickson noted. \nYet others have mixed feelings. \nChrissi Steiner, 34, also a Marylander who recently returned from China, having lived there for the past four years as a missionary, has been surprised by the bitter divide in American politics. \n\"I hear 'we' and 'them' and you can't be in the middle,\" she lamented. \"That has really shocked me. There are things I really appreciate about Obama, there are things I appreciate about Trump. But I don't agree with either one of them on every issue.\" \nCP asked Steiner what she thought of the new president. \n\"I really think Trump's foreign policy is non-existent. I feel like he's not very knowledgeable about history, our allies versus things that could cause trouble,\" Steiner replied. \n\"Every word out of the president's mouth means something,\" she said, adding that she hopes his publicity people take his Twitter account away. \n\"I hope [Trump] can bring everybody together but I don't know that that's possible.\" Follow Brandon Showalter on Twitter: @BrandonMShow Follow Brandon Showalter on Facebook: @BrandonMShow", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T17:26:04.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
