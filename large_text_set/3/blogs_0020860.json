However, the back wasn’t visible in that render so we couldn’t really get a sense of how the handset looked in different colors. Just yesterday, Blass tweeted out another render which showcased both the front and rear design of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus in Orchid Gray and Black Sky colors . \nHe has now tweeted a new leaked press render which reveals all three colors of Samsung’s upcoming flagship smartphone. In the image posted below, you can see the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus from top to bottom in Black Sky, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver colors. \nSamsung has used black on the front of every Galaxy S8 color option to make the handset look even better. Black works for the front as it does a good job of hiding the sensors on the front. We wrote a detailed piece about this, discussing the merits of going with an all-black front for the new flagship. \nIt’s possible that Samsung might offer some other color options in select markets down the line but from the looks of it, these three will be the ones that are made widely available once the handset is released next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:04:15.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
