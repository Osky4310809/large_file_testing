You had Italians, Puerto Ricans, people from all over the world, and you didn’t have to pay to go there – it was truly a people’s place’ Boy With Sunglasses, 1950 ‘I loved riding the Cyclone rollercoaster. I’d get a seat right at the front. Then I’d stand up while going down the steepest drop, turn round, and shoot whoever was behind me screaming’ Kids Ride the Whip, 1950 ‘The advice I give my students is this: when your jaw drops, click the shutter. My jaw dropped all the time on Coney Island’ Sharing a Public Bench, 1949 Feinstein died in 2015; the New York Times declared he was ‘one of the most accomplished recorders of the American experience’ in his obituary Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:35:40.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
