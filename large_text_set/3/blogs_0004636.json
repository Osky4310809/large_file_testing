By Anusha Iyengar  44 pm Sonam Kapoor rocks the black frill dress at a recent event – check out pics \nFrom making outrageous statements about co-actors on a talk show to speaking only where it matters the most, Sonam Kapoor has definitely come a long way. There’s more to this woman than just carrying fashion labels and style. In an interview with Femina, the actress revealed that she was groped when she was 13 and had even complained to her teachers about it. Sadly the teachers brushed it off saying that it happens all the time. Now that is one thing that most girls face but a lot of them don’t understand that it’s molestation. Luckily for Sonam, she did know what it was and stood against it. \nThe actress recalls the incident,” Before I became a celebrity, I was just a regular pretty girl in public. This happened when I was at a movie hall. I was groped by a guy who I couldn’t see in the dark. I was only 13 years old and deeply disturbed by the whole episode. I remember going to my teacher and school counsellor, and telling them about it. They said that everybody is groped; that groping is not molestation. They thought rape was molestation. Even at 13 I knew what it was—that if somebody gropes you or squeezes your breasts, it is molestation. I spoke to my mum about it in order to deal with it.” (ALSO READ: Sonam Kapoor or Nicole Kidman: Who wore this Dior outfit better? ) \nShe adds,” The level of awareness in our schools is so low; there is no sex education and teachers are not equipped to handle such cases. Our education system just does not know any better. Girls slip into depression. They blame themselves and it’s a horrible place to be in. It’s important for all of us to know that be it India or any other country, there is no safe haven for women. Somebody can grab your behind in a nightclub or a crowd and you need to know that it’s serious, it’s molestation.” We couldn’t agree with her more. Now that’s what we meant when we said, she speaks about things that matter the most. \nWhat do you think?
