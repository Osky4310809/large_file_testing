But after Sunday’s feat, which saw him join the 5,000 career points club, the Fil-Am forward is just grateful to be able to get another accomplishment at this stage of his PBA career. “It’s a nice milestone in my career,” Washington said. ADVERTISEMENT Washington’s basket at the 2:35 mark of the second quarter allowed him to cross that off of the list, becoming the 83rd overall player to make it to 5,000. He’s also the 79th local to do so, the 19th among active players, and the first Elasto Painter to reach that many points. “It’s nice to be the first player in a Rain or Shine jersey to have that accomplishment. My career started here so it’s nice to have something like that on a team that I consider my family,” he said, looking back at his PBL days when he suited up for the Welcoat franchise before being drafted by Air21 first in the 2005 PBA Draft. Though he spent the better half of the last five years bouncing around from one team to another, Washington’s caliber is undeniable, winning two Best Player of the Conference awards as a member of San Miguel Beer while also winning three championships in his 12-year career. But now, his focus is on the Elasto Painters where he seeks to pay back the gamble this team took with him. “It’s full circle to be back here — getting back here and having that kind of milestone. I’m grateful for them for bringing me back and being part of this family. It’s an honor,” he said. Proud of his achievement, Washington now just has one wish left in his PBA career, which is to wrap up his playing days with Rain or Shine. “Hopefully, I’ll be here for the remainder of my career. I’ll start here and finish here. That’s my plan and that’s what I want,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T11:33:28.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
