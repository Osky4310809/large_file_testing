Top stories from Tuesday's Mirror \nTRANSFERS EXCLUSIVE - Chelsea are bracing themselves for a summer-long battle with Real Madrid over Eden Hazard. The Premier League champions-elect have so far rejected any approach from the Spanish club for their Belgian winger. But Real believe Hazard is interested in finally working with head coach Zinedine Zidane after five years at Stamford Bridge. The 26-year-old is also understood to be learning Spanish, and Chelsea are refusing to comment publicly on claims they promised Hazard to consider any offer from the Bernabeu for his services. Eden Hazard is being eyed by Real Madrid (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Southampton are preparing a £20million bid for Anfield bad-boy Mamadou Sakho. The out-of-favour Liverpool defender has impressed during a loan period with Crystal Palace, with the Londoners keeping clean sheets in all three games he’s played. However, Palace don’t have an option to buy in the agreement which will keep him at Selhurst Park until the end of the season. Manchester City winger Jesus Navas is a summer target for Spain's Sevilla, the club he left for the Blues four years ago. \nOTHER NEWS Everton are confident Seamus Coleman will make it back from his career-threatening double-leg break. The Toffees' Republic of Ireland international defender is highly unlikely to play again in 2017 after his tibia and fibia were snapped in a sickening tackle by Wales’ Neil Taylor during a World Cup qualifier on Friday night.

The best-case scenario would see him sidelined for seven to nine months.
