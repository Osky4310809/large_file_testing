Priebus suggested the rumors were being spread by a low-level staffer, while Bannon suggested that “the media, the opposition party” was simply telling lies. \n“Many people sympathetic to Spicer in and out of the White House believe otherwise,” Byers reports. “Five of these sources think the person behind the leaks is Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s ever-visible White House counselor. Though they offer no hard evidence, they say Conway is trying to offload blame for administration setbacks on Spicer to prove she is the more effective public advocate…” \nConway of course denies the charge. “Absolutely not,” she said in a statement. “It’s absolutely false. Sean has my full support, but most importantly, he has the President’s full support. We work as a team.” \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T17:17:55.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
