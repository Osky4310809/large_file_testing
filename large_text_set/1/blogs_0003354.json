Share Auditions last for 90 minutes, Eddie, not an hour (Photo: Michael Steele) Share Get Arsenal FC   Thank you for subscribing!   \nArsenal brilliantly fought back from 3-0 down to earn a draw with Bournemouth on Tuesday, but Gunners fans were still left underwhelmed with the result. \nEddie Howe's side were superb for the first hour of the game, racing into a three-goal lead as the Gunners fell apart. \nAnd although Arsene Wenger's side came back to grab a point on the south coast, Arsenal fans were still left angry as they dropped two points in the title race.

What sort of name is that? \n\"Eddie? That's a name for children and ski-jumping Eagles. And Howe? It's literally a question. As in Howe could he ever be good enough for us? \n\"Give me a Diego or a Massimiliano or a Jorge any day. But Eddie? Nah\" \"He's very young\" \"Er, can I asked for your ID please sir?\" (Photo: Warren Little) \n\"What is he, like 12? Alright, 20-odd at a push, but still. \n\"How can he be expected to deal with the pressures of managing Arsenal - the GREATEST team in the world for about two-thirds of every season - when he looks as though he still gets asked for ID when he's buying alcohol at Tesco? \n\"Give him another 10 years, then he'll be ready to consistently deliver good football for a bit until we get found out in March and it all falls apart. \n\"The Arsenal way.\" \"Yeah, go on then. Anyone but Wenger\" \"I've heard you want my job?\" (Photo: Warren Little) \n\"At this stage I'll take anyone with a pulse over that washed-up, overstayed-his-welcome fella who really should walk for the good of the club. \n\"So come on then Eddie, do your worst. \n\"Not literally, obvously. You WILL be expected to win everything.\" \"He play good football and he'll get Wilshere fit and back to his best\" Is Eddie Howe a miracle worker? (Photo: Michael Steele) \n\"This is a man who has consistently got Jack Wilshere starting and playing in Premier League football matches. He's a God. \n\"His team plays nice stuff too, even if Hector Bellerin and Granit Xhaka did help them out a bit.\" \"He'll need to improve when going 3-0 up though\" poll loading Would Eddie Howe be a good replacement for Arsene Wenger? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:39:04.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
