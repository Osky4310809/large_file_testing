Vargas and fellow “dreamers” must reapply for DACA every two years. Vargas’s lapsed, but she was in the process of renewing, the Ledger reported.\nICE agents arrested her father and brother outside their home last month but Vargas hid in a closet, and agents later handcuffed her, and then released her, the Ledger reported. She went into hiding and came out to speak at the news conference but moments later ICE agents pulled over her friend’s car as the two were driving home, according to the paper.\nShe is currently being held, and a judge will determine if she must return to Argentina.\nICE spokesman Thomas Byrd told Buzzfeed that the arrest was part of a “targeted action” because Vargas’ status had lapsed, adding that “ICE does not conduct sweeps or raids that target aliens indiscriminately.”\nAn executive order President Trump issued in January compels federal immigration agents to step up enforcement, but Trump has said they would focus on criminal offenders first.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:43:02.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
