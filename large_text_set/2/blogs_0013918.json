Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/Jean-Paul Pelissier/Business Insider \nLONDON – Yanis Varoufakis, the outspoken former Greek finance minister, thinks US President Donald Trump risks stoking a Europe-style debt crisis with his economic plan. \n\"My great concern with Donald Trump is that his economic pronouncements don't square up,\" Varoufakis said in an interview with Bloomberg TV's Guy Johnson . \nVaroufakis said Trump's proposed $1 trillion (£830 billion) government spending plan \"is unfunded and will lead to skyrocketing deficits if he succeeds with all the tax cuts he wants to push through.\" \nAt the same time, diplomatic tensions could lead China to sell its holdings of US Treasurys, pushing up bond yields and making it more expensive for Trump to fund the plan by borrowing on the international capital market. \nIt's a sequence that echoes the European debt crisis, which started in 2010 when investors lost confidence in the ability of Greece and other southern European countries to fund government spending and pay back their national debt. That led to higher government borrowing costs, a series of banking crises, and sharp cuts in spending and economic growth. \n\"But when yields of Treasurys start skyrocketing,\" Varoufakis said, Trump would \"slam on the brakes of austerity, which is the last thing global capitalism needs at the moment.\" \nVaroufakis also said the UK government was making a \"mistake\" in its approach to Brexit negotiations, prioritizing a hard Brexit over the free movement of Europeans and membership of the single market. \n\"What we've had in Britain after the referendum is a magnificent transformation of people like Theresa May from moderate remainers to gung-ho Brexiteers,\" Varoufakis said. \nMay, the British prime minister, \"is making a substantial mistake,\" he said, adding: \"She's not preparing the British people for a negotiation that will be inefficient and may well lead to a hard Brexit by default after Article 50 is triggered.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:38:33.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
