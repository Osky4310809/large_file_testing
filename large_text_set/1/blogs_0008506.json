They also add new loading screen art and quotes from the board game. Those Skeletons look pretty intimidating with long-handled scythes. Vampire Counts: Human Levies and Additional Vampire Counts Units \nDownload here and here \nThere are humans who live in the cursed land of Sylvania as well as undead, because somebody has to sweep the floors in all those brooding gothic castles. The Human Levies mod lets you field units of those poor peasants, mortals with swords or spears as well as hunters with bows, giving the undead their first ranged weapons. You're limited to a maximum of two units of archers to prevent them from being too unbalancing. The Additional Vampire Counts Units mod is similar, but adds crossbows and powerful halberdiers if you're less worried about balance. Chaos Dwarf Warrior Units \nDownload here \nYou'll need the Warriors of Chaos DLC to use this one. In an unmodded game the heavy metal berserkers of Chaos keep Dwarfs around to look after the artillery, but with this they can field entire units of the angry bearded chaps – some with horns and others with ace pointy Babylonian helmets. They carry burning brands for their fire attacks and have high stats, but are costly and need to be recruited via a new building called the Tower of Darkness. Bugman Thrower Unit \nDownload here \nYou'll need The King and the Warlord DLC for this one, which gives the Dwarfs yet another artillery unit, albeit one with a twist. It launches burning barrels of Bugman's Brew, and though it's not an accurate weapon when it does hit the damage can be significant. It also buffs the Dwarfs around it, who can't be stopped from taking cheeky sips even if the stuff they're drinking is highly explosive. Ogre Leadbelchers \nDownload here \nThe Imperials get a new unit in the chubby shape of the Ogre Leadbelchers, mercenaries who give the expression “handcannon” new meaning by lugging around actual cannon barrels to fire at the enemy. They're slow to shoot, but effective when they do. Screaming Skull Catapults \nGiving artillery to the Vampire Counts may not be great for game balance but they certainly look cool. These bone contraptions launch screaming skulls, and even the skeletons who crew them flinch and cover their earholes at the noise. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T21:19:14.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
