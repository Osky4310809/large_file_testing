Italian motorcycle apparel maker Dainese is at CES in Las Vegas this week touting the company’s latest line of wearable airbag technology—and one that’s finally about to be for sale here. This high-tech system can recognize a crash within milliseconds to deploy an airbag inside your jacket to protect you from impact.\nDainese has already offered this type of jacket for a couple years in Europe, but liability concerns in the U.S. meant that until now it has only offered its D-air system in a pricey racing suit for the track.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe good news is that D-air equipped jackets are scheduled to go on sale to North American street riders in April. The bad news is that it’s still pretty darn pricey.\n\nThe Cyclone D-air, a Gore-Tex touring jacket, will run about $2,000, while the more sporty leather Misano jacket and the “urban” Continental will go for about $300 less.\nThat’s going exceed the cost of some of the top-of-the-line (but non-airbag equipped) riding jackets from the likes of Rukka, Rev’It or Klim. And if you have the misfortune of having the airbag go off in a crash, there’s an extra cost and effort needed to send the jacket back to Dainese to have it repaired and re-armed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T03:09:43.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
