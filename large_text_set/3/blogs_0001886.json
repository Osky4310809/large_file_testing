Purchase: Order Reprint Marc Faillettaz and Felix Mankovich are strangers who grew up with different religions, in different countries. But Thursday night, the men joined together in a crowd of more that 200 united in denouncing the recent wave of hate crimes and bomb threats against Jewish community centers around the country, including two in Minnesota. The rally at the Highland Park rec center in St. Paul, organized by Jewish Community Action, drew Christians, Muslims, Jews and others looking to support one another. “I want to figure out how I can get involved,” said Faillettaz, a Minneapolis schoolteacher who said he grew up Lutheran. Mankovich, an IT worker in Minneapolis who came to the United States from Russia as a child, said recent anti-Semitic actions around the country have led him, for the first time, to question whether it is safe to be Jewish in the United States. He said he feels a new “unease,” and that he and his wife, Samantha Riehle, recently have been reaching out more for community. Speakers, including St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman, urged people to stand up against bigotry. Renee Jones Schneider - Star Tribune Sheila Harrow Brod, leaning forward, and others gathered for an interfaith rally at the Highland Park rec center on Thursday. The group came together to denounce the recent wave of hate crimes against Jewish centers. Jaylani Hussein, head of the Minnesota chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations, said that simply gathering together in a room was a first step in coming together. “We are with you; we will always be with you,” Hussein told the crowd. With the small auditorium filled to capacity, many people gathered outside in the lobby to watch the speakers on a screen. The Rev. Janne Eller-Isaacs, who is a co-minister at Unity Church-Unitarian in St. Paul, said she canceled a meeting to make the rally. “Violence against any of our community is violence against all,” she said. On Feb. 20, a phoned-in bomb threat forced the nearby St. Paul Jewish Community Center to evacuate more than 300 people, including children in a day care facility. A similar bomb threat last month forced Sabes Jewish Community Center in St. Louis Park, home to an elementary school, to evacuate more than 400 people. The FBI is investigating the bomb threats, and law enforcement officials have said they could be the work of one person. At the University of Minnesota, a recent rash of anti-Semitic graffiti and fliers on campus resulted in the arrest of an 18-year-old student.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T06:01:26.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
