Anderson Cooper Says He’s Muted Trump On Twitter \nSessions has faced seemingly non-stop calls to recuse himself and subsequently resign from his post, though he has doggedly asserted he did not mislead senators with his responses. \nMany Democrats have tried to box Sessions into a corner, leaving him with a choice between two undesirable options: Admit to lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in his testimony at best, or committing perjury at worst. \nSessions, following the recommendation of Justice Department ethics officials, agreed to recuse himself from investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign, including any supposed Russian interference in the electoral process.   \nMuch to President Trump’s dismay , Sessions concluded he should not be involved in any investigation of the Trump campaign to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. \nSessions did, however, defend his response to Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken at his confirmation hearing in a letter the Department of Justice released Monday. He maintained he “did not mention communications (he) had had with the Russian ambassador over the years because the question did not ask about them.” \nThe attorney general again addressed his meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, saying his meetings with Kislyak were in his capacity as a senator, not related to the campaign. \nSessions said in the letter that he “spoke briefly” to Kislyak on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July and also met with Kislyak in his office in September, a meeting that was attended by his staff, he said.   Gowdy: Evidence So Far Lacking To Support Trump’s Wiretap Claim \nSome have said the rendezvous Kislyak had with Sessions at the Republican National Convention in July was an Obama White House-sponsored event . The Russian ambassador was there as one of about 80 ambassadors participating in an official diplomatic program, coordinated by the State Department. \nDefenders have said the other times Sessions met with Kislyak were within the capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which a 1946 act gave responsibility for legislative oversight of the nation’s military, including the Department of Defense, military research and development and other matters related to military members and defense policy. \nA host of Democratic lawmakers — including Sens. Maria Cantwell, Wash.; Bob Casey, Pa.; Amy Klobuchar, Minn.; Jack Reed, R.I.; Sheldon Whitehouse, R.I.; and Claire McCaskill, Mo. — have also met with Kislyak as part of their job. \nCalifornia Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, one of Trump’s more vocal critics, also met with Kislyak, though she initially denied the occurrence of such a meeting. \nDemocrats have called some of Sessions’ answers misleading or contradictory, though others have defended his answers as truthful and to the point. One answer that gave Democrats pause was Sessions’ response to Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy. \nLeahy asked, explicitly: “Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?” \nSessions responded with a curt “no,” which he said fit within the narrow scope of Leahy’s question. \nWhile Democrats have said Sessions was dishonest in his original testimony, others have said it is Democrats who are acting dishonestly with their “ new McCarthyism .” \n“Sessions is the victim of the type of McCarthyite character assassination that the left used to condemn. Remember when accusing people without evidence of coordinating with the Kremlin was frowned upon? No longer, apparently,” wrote Marc Thiessen, a contributor to the Chicago Tribune and Washington Post. \nIn a seeming effort to keep the peace, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley thanked Sessions for his letter, saying it helped to “clear up confusion.” “I appreciate Attorney General Sessions’ quick action to clear up confusion about his statement and I look forward to confirming the team who can help him carry out the functions of the department, like going after sex offenders, protecting Americans against terrorists and criminal activity, and stopping drug traffickers,” the Iowa Republican said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:16:46.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
