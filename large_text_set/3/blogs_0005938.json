Yet here he is, two years short of matching Joe Torre’s 12-year run with the Yankees. Only two major-league managers, the Angels’ Mike Scioscia and Giants’ Bruce Bochy, have been with their current teams longer. \nWhich isn’t to say that Girardi is secure. \nBoth his contract and general manager Brian Cashman’s expire at the end of the season. The Yankees have played in only one postseason game the past four years, losing the wild-card game in 2015. Their last playoff victory was in ’11, and their drought only figures to continue this season as they retool with younger players. \nYet, if Girardi is worried, he isn’t letting on. And frankly, he shouldn’t be worried at all. \nConsider: \n*Girardi, 52, has proven he can manage young talent — he was named National League Manager of the Year in 2006 after overachieving with a Marlins club younger than the Yankees club he will lead this season. \n*With the Yankees, his teams have matched or outperformed their expected win-loss totals, based on run differential, six times in nine years – and missed by a total of seven wins in the other three seasons. \n*The new Baseball Prospectus Annual ranked Girardi as the best bullpen manager in the game last season, basing its metric on how well relievers performed and if they were used in the highest-leverage situations possible. \n“I pride myself on being very objective in terms of trying to judge the impact that a manager and coaches have on the players they’re given — and I stress, the players they’re given,” Cashman said. “You have to be true and honest with yourself in real time about what you are and who you are, and then try to incorporate that in the evaluation of your field staff, so you can treat them fairly. \n“The biggest thing is, as long as Joe commands the respect of that locker room and they continue to look to him as a leader and he’s making consistently good strategic moves as he’s always done, then he’ll be fine regardless. That’s who he’s been. That’s why he’s been here for 10 years.” \nThe Yankees missed the playoffs in Girardi’s first season, won the World Series in his second, reached the postseason but fell short of the Series in his next three. \nSince then, the team’s talent has aged and eroded, with Girardi presiding over the final seasons of Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. Still, Girardi has yet to manage a sub-.500 club in New York, though three of his past four had run differentials that suggested losing records. Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports \nTen years. \nTo think, Girardi had only one year of managing experience, in ‘06 with the Marlins, before taking over the Yankees in ’08. Growing up in East Peoria, Il., he never dreamed of life beyond his playing career, much less life as an older man. As a player, bouncing between the Cubs, Rockies, Yankees and Cardinals, he came to understand that he was unlikely to stay in one place too long. \n“Too many things can happen. I learned that early on,” Girardi said. “My dream as a kid was to play for the Chicago Cubs. I get drafted by the Cubs, play with the Cubs, we make the playoffs my first year. I think I’m going to be there forever. And I’m gone four years later. \n“I don’t think about how long I’m ever going to be someplace. That’s never my mentality. My mentality is, worry about this year. That has always been my mentality.” \nStill … 10 years. \nHis children — Serena, 17; Dante, 15; and Lena, 10 — have essentially grown up with their father as Yankees manager. \nGirardi said it again: \n“To be in one place for 10 years, where my kids have basically been in the same place, it’s hard to believe.” \n\n\nGirardi looks back with pride upon the ’06 Marlins, who finished 78-84 but stayed in wild-card contention until September despite fielding the game’s lowest payroll. \nAs Girardi recalls, the team used 23 rookies that season, including second baseman Dan Uggla, shortstop Hanley Ramirez, left fielder Josh Willingham and four starting pitchers — Josh Johnson, Ricky Nolasco, Scott Olsen and Anibal Sanchez. \nThe Marlins (read: Jeffrey Loria) fired Girardi after that season, but more than a decade later Girardi describes the experience as “a blast” and responds quickly when asked what he likes about managing young players. \n“Their energy level,” Girardi said. “They’re louder a lot of times. It’s like being around your kids in a sense almost. There are some things that happen that make you laugh and scratch your head. But it’s enjoyable to me.” \nThe Yankees are likely to start one 24-year-old, catcher Gary Sanchez, and give significant playing time to two others, first baseman Greg Bird and right fielder Aaron Judge. Two of the team’s five starting pitchers also figure to be young. And camp is teeming with other prospects whom Girardi cannot wait to see advance. \n\nOn Sunday, before the Yankees beat the Pirates, 3-2, in a Grapefruit League exhibition, he excitedly rattled off names. \nOutfielder Billy McKinney, a secondary piece in the Aroldis Chapman trade — “he’s torn it up — I mean, torn it up ,” Girardi said. Shortstop Jorge Mateo, who recently hit an automatic double that left Girardi disappointed — Mateo was flying around the bases, and the manager wanted to see him keep running. Shortstop Gleyber Torres. Outfielder Clint Frazier. Right-handers James Kaprelian and Chance Adams. Left-hander Jordan Montgomery. On and on. \n“Our kids have looked fabulous,” Girardi said, speaking with emphasis. “I’m extremely impressed by our players in the minor leagues right now. It’s like, ‘Wow.’” \nWhat is the difference managing such kids? \n“It’s just more teaching,” Girardi said. “You have to observe more closely. With young players, you worry about them when they go through struggles, how they handle it. If you have a seasoned veteran … if Derek went 0-for-25, you weren’t going to worry about Derek. Derek wasn’t going to be looking over his shoulder to see if someone else was coming. \n“You have to manage the expectations, how they handle it. I think about managing Gary Sanchez. There are two things you have to manage with him. You have to manage his playing time so he stays extremely productive offensively. The other thing is, you have to manage the expectations … I don’t know if anyone is going to hit 60 homers.” \nCashman, asked if he was comfortable with Girardi managing young players, responded with one word: “Very.” \n“I think Joe thrives with younger players,” Cashman said. “It’s something that comes very easily and naturally to him.” \nIn the GM’s view, the challenge for Girardi was greater when he took over the Yankees at age 43. He had to manage former teammates and eventually guide some of them – including his former rival for playing time, Jorge Posada – to the ends of their respective careers. \nAll of the icons are gone now. Left-hander CC Sabathia and outfielder Brett Gardner are the only remaining of the Yankees’ 2009 World Series championship team. \nThe transition is on. \n“I think Joe thrives with younger players,” Cashman said. “It’s something that comes very easily and naturally to him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:18:01.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
