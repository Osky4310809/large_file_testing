She made a statement [on Facebook Live]...and said some very not nice things about homosexuals, so I didn’t feel like that was good of me to have her on the show, to have a platform.”\nDeGeneres then passes the baton to Williams, who says in part:\n“There’s no space—there’s no room for any kind of prejudice in 2017 and moving on. She’s a fantastic singer, I love her, just like I love everybody else and we all got to get used to that. We all have to get used to everyone’s differences and understand that this is a big, gigantic, beautiful, colorful world and it only works with inclusion and empathy. It only works that way...The world is a beautiful place, but it does not work without empathy and inclusion. God is love. This universe is love.”\nThis is all nice, heartwarming stuff, and receives plenty of applause, but I found myself wishing both Williams and DeGeneres had called Burrell’s actions out a little more explicitly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T18:44:07.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
