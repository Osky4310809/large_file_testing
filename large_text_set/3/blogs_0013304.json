Apparently BLU plays by different rules though, as the new BLU Life One X2 Mini is actually more expensive and slightly more powerful than its bigger brother. \nFor some perspective, the One X2 is priced at just $150 and is powered by a Snapdragon 430 with 2GB RAM, and includes 16GB storage and microSD for expansion. There’s also a $200 variant that has 4GB RAM and 64GB storage.\nMeanwhile the new X2 Mini is offered in just one version, with the same Snapdragon 430 processor but instead opts for 4GB RAM and 64GB storage with microSD. With a suggested retail price of $180, it sits right in the middle of the two variants of the One X2 in terms of pricing and features.\nOther specs for the X2 Mini include a 5-inch display (vs the 5.2-inch screen in the original), a 13MP Sony IMX main cam, a 8MP selfie cam, and a 2300 mAh battery.There’s also a fingerprint scanner, software based on Android Marshmallow, dual SIM support, and all the basic connectivity options you’d expect. The only area where the One X2 really trumps the Mini is in battery and screen size.\nSee also: Best cheap Android phones (February 2017) 3 weeks ago If you’re looking for a good, basic phone at a solid price, the Life One X2 Mini could be exactly what you’re looking for.
