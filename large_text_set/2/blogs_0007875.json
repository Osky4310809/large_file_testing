It's a terrific long read for the weekend, going in-depth with the sci-fi shooter's systems creation, environmental design and tons more. It sounds like a slightly weirder game than the trailers made it seem—and that's a good thing. As Phil says, it's a successor to the Shock lineage of immersive sim games, and with System Shock 3 itself still a long way off, there aren't loads of other games out this year doing anything like Prey. \nJames Davenport: Modders getting their money \nI think that if you do work that others benefit from, you should be paid for that work. It’s a bit reductive when applied to the previously heated controversy around Valve’s first attempt at paid mods, but in our recent interview, they made it clear they’re not giving up on the idea. Evan flew out to Valve HQ and heard it from the man himself , Gabe Newell, who said, “The Gaming community needs to reward people who are creating value.” \nIt’s a simple, clear message, and one that no PC gamer should be afraid of. It doesn’t mean free mods are going to disappear or that the scene will suddenly die. Ideally, the marketplace would redistribute itself naturally through demand and competition. Smart people work at Valve believe in it, even if they can seem impenetrable at times. But what it means is that teams creating total conversions or remasters can potentially quit their day jobs and work full time on making more cool shit for the games we love. \nImagine a world where we see several complete, polished campaigns released for Skyrim every year instead of once or twice during its entire lifespan. Even better, imagine the pressure it would put on existing developers to incorporate mod support into their games. Maybe we could’ve . Worst case scenario: we pay people for hard work. Best case scenario: modding becomes a mainstream, legitimized development path. \nChris Thursten: For Honor? I hardly knew 'er \nI'm pretty sure I've made Ubisoft's third-person sword-‘em-up my high of the week before, but I've been playing this game on and off since the first closed alpha and it's always a highlight every time a new testing period begins. Its combat system has sunk its claws into me, and it's become the game I'm impatient to play whenever (a) the beta goes away again or (b) I have to do some work. \nI've made my home in the 1v1 and 2v2 lobbies, which is I think where the game shows its best side. Unpicking the complexities of each character matchup is genuinely satisfying, and it’s heartening to see the kind of social code that I associate with Jedi Knight server communities appear in a big-budget game by a major publisher. There's a sort of silly decorum to a duel, here, and in a 2v2 it's bad manners to pile in on a lone opponent. The game's called For Honor, not For Being A Dick, and the sense of community this creates within each match lobby is a highlight. \nThat's not the whole story, mind. I really like throwing people off stuff. Like, I really like it. I can't make excuses for that. Every honor system needs its pariahs, I guess. \nChris Livingston: Chow down \nI've looted my own corpse in videogames before, naturally, but this week I experienced a first: eating my own corpse. While playing Early Access survival game The Wild Eight, I died a lot—it's challenging, what with starvation, freezing, and wild animals to contend with—and when you die, all the items you're carrying drop. You can pick them up in your next life, and even find a ready-made meal: your own human flesh from your recently deceased body. Which you can then eat . \nMaybe eating my corpse shouldn't be the best part of my week, but I'm always pleased when a game gives me the chance to do something I've never done before. A+, would eat myself again. \nTom Senior: Hyper Light Grifter \nI like to play tricky games in small bursts.
