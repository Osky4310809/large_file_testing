Clady is a ol burned has been. Denver had high hopes for him. He is a burned out, past prine, playa! Feb 15, 2017 6:57 PM \nHe is good but is he healthy? The Seahawks could use him. realfan41 says: Feb 15, 2017 7:04 PM \nVikes should sign him. Feb 15, 2017 7:05 PM \nEveryone loves $5MM per year left tackles. Unless you’re a franchise right tackle… Feb 15, 2017 7:09 PM \nthat guy sucks bassplucker says: Feb 15, 2017 7:09 PM \nHe was one of the best in the biz until that first knee injury. Never truly came all the way back after that IMO. Not a guy I would spend a roster spot on at this point in his career, even if he came cheap. Feb 15, 2017 7:16 PM \niNJURIES aside, this guy was always lazy! maverick2560 says: Feb 15, 2017 7:27 PM \nShould Dallas sign him as a right tackle? I guess it comes down to who is beat up more Doug Free with his foot and ankle or Clady? Doug Free had a fairly good season. I believe his foot and ankle injury started to effect him down the stretch. Before that he played his butt off, despite being banged up. nyneal says: Feb 15, 2017 7:36 PM \nThe Jests are in cap hell, so it’s not a surprise they will be dumping aging veterans.
