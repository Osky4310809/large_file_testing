Defense Dept tweets on mental health, social media use Published time: 24 Jan, 2017 00:00 Get short URL US President Donald Trump. © Nicholas Kamm / AFP A tweet from the US Department of Defense (DoD) about social media use being an indicator of mental health has led many to wonder if the national security body is subtly trolling President Donald Trump. \n\"Social media postings sometimes provide an important window into a person’s #mentalhealth, Know what to look for,” the department tweeted from its official account. \nThe tweet links to research on military suicide funded by the DoD’s Suicide Prevention Office which claims that social media use “can provide an important window into a person’s state of mind.” Social media postings sometimes provide an important window into a person’s #mentalhealth .

However, the wording of the tweet has led many people to assume the DoD was making a veiled reference to the new president. \n“Day 3 of American Dystopia, and @DeptofDefense is subtweeting the president,” @summerbrennan said in response to the tweet. — Mike Flacy (@mikeflacy) January 23, 2017 \n\"Y'all know he shut down tweets from Dept of Interior for less than this. Hope y'all survive the next purge,\" @doctornayaka said, referencing the fact that a blanket ban was reportedly placed on all Department of Interior Twitter accounts after the National Park Service retweeted pictures which showed a massive difference in crowd size between President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009 and Trump’s on Friday. \nREAD MORE: National Park Service ‘regrets mistaken’ less than positive Trump retweets \nThroughout his time in politics, and indeed beforehand, Trump constantly used Twitter to air his grievances, attack opponents and thank supporters. As recently as Sunday, he used the social media site to take aim at the Women’s March which protested his presidency. \nNumerous Twitter users also posted humorous pictures and videos alluding to their belief that the DoD was referring to Trump. Many of the messages received hundreds of likes and retweets. — Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) January 23, 2017 @DeptofDefense me reading this knowing it's the ill Trump subtweet. pic.twitter.com/SsS3iAdVxm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:20:19.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
