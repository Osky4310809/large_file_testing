There’s no question it is the equivalent of what happened in Charleston at the church, which was one of the most horrible incidents that’s occurred in this nation in many years: a racially motivated act of domestic terrorism,” he said, comparing Monday’s violence to the heartless slaughter of nine black parishioners at the hands of Dylann Roof in 2015.\nJames Harris Jackson traveled from Baltimore to New York to massacre as many black men as he could in Times Square, investigators say.\nHe fatally plunged an 18-inch sword into victim Timothy Caughman on West 36th Street near Ninth Avenue late on Monday night and then turned himself in the next day, according to a criminal complaint.\nDe Blasio refused to comment on the attack as reports emerged the attack was racially motivated on Thursday — instead demanding reporters assembled for a press conference only ask about his long-shot mansion-tax proposal.\n“I’m here to talk about this. If you want to talk about this, great,” de Blasio said, referring to his proposed tax on property sales of $2 million or more.\n“If not, we’ll take questions another way another time.”\nJackson was charged with second degree murder as a hate crime and weapons possession, and a judge ordered him held without bail on Thursday.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T20:19:20.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
