But did you know the pearls most of us wear today are cultured pearls? This means their existence was initiated by humans as opposed to being formed naturally. Pearl farmers insert a bead or other object into an oyster or clam. Cultured pearls can be either freshwater or saltwater. Among freshwater and saltwater pearls, there are many different pearl varieties . Regardless, no matter what type you own, how you clean your pearls is the same. Here's a major disclaimer: this is NOT the same way you clean your other fine jewelry pieces. Cleaning pearls and caring for them takes a little knowledge and finesse. Why Do Pearls Need Special Care? \nUnderstanding how pearls are formed will help you understand why pearls need extra care. To put it simply, a small seed, bead, or particle is covered in a shiny nacre substance that is secreted by the mollusk. The depth of the nacre coating depends on the type of creature involved, the water it lives in, and how long the intruder is left in place before it is removed. As nacre thickness increases, so does the quality and durability of the pearl. \nIf the nacre of your pearl is thin and fragile, it can easily be chipped off which leaves unsightly gaps, chips, or cracks. In the worst case, the pearl can unravel entirely, leaving you with a dull, lifeless bead. Even fake glass and plastic pearls need special care because their coating is significantly thinner and more fragile than nacre. \nAnother reason pearls need special cleaning consideration is because many of them are strung. This string is like any other string. If you leave it submerged in fluid for too long, it can stain, weaken, and break. So let's get started. How to Keep Pearls Clean \nAs we said earlier, even cultured pearls with thicker coatings are more fragile than most other gemstones, so you must handle them carefully to keep them in the best condition. Your pearls will stay cleaner if you put them on after you've applied your makeup and perfume. Be sure to take off your pearl rings before you apply hand and body creams. Wipe your pearls with a soft, lint-free cloth as soon as you take them off. The cloth can be dampened with water, or it can be dry. If damp, allow the pearls to air dry before putting them away. Dirty pearls can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution (try Ivory bar soaps flakes). Don't submerge pearls in liquid. If cleaning, use a damp lint free cloth with the cleaning solution. Make sure you rinse off all the solution and pat try, making sure never to leave the pearls under water. Never clean your pearls with solutions that contain ammonia or harsh detergents. Don't under any circumstances put pearl jewelry in an ultrasonic cleaner . The vibrations can severely damage the nacre coating. Don't use abrasive cleaners or rub pearls with abrasive cloth. Both can wear away the nacre coating, leaving you with a plain looking bead. Storing Pearls \nDon't store your pearls with other jewelry because they can be scratched easily when metal or gemstones rub against them. Find a special slot in your jewelry box for the pearls, or keep them in a soft bag made from chamois or another non-abrasive material. \nYour fine pearl necklaces should be restrung periodically so that you're sure the silk or nylon cord holding them is in good shape.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:41:34.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
