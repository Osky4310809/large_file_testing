It was only commenced to harass the investigative reporters. Pathetic misuse of the legal system \n‚Äî Christoff Durr (@duerr_2) January 11, 2017 \nThe Washington Times reports that StemExpress dropped the suit ‚Äúone day before an appellate hearing was set to take place on a motion to strike the complaint.‚Äù A statement released Wednesday by the Center for Medical Progress reads, in part: \nCMP‚Äôs undercover videos exposed StemExpress in July 2015 as a major illegal vendor of aborted fetal organs and tissue from some of the biggest Planned Parenthood affiliates in the country. \n‚Ä¶ \nStemExpress, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America have been referred by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Energy & Commerce Committee‚Äôs Select Investigative Panel to the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The sale or purchase of human fetal tissue is a federal felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $500,000 (42 U.S.C. 289g-2). \nThat‚Äôs what happens when the old standby of dismissing incriminating video as ‚Äúheavily edited‚Äù doesn‚Äôt fly.
