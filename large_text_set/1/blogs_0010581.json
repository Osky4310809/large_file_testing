Jeff Sessions on ideological grounds while Republican reservations are complicating the nomination of ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state.

Many are confirmed nearly unanimously. Hillary Clinton was confirmed to be secretary of state in 2009 in a 94 to 2 vote, for example. \nBut sometimes controversy derails a candidate, or at least peels off support. And the margin of the final confirmation vote in the Senate can be important, indicating the level of support for the administration's policy agenda and signaling future partisan battles, especially for the most important cabinet positions. Trump's Russian Posture Leads to GOP Doubts \nFollowing his full-day hearing Wednesday, some key Republicans and a large number of Democrats remain on the fence, at best, about their support for Tillerson to become the nation's top diplomat. \nThe major issue impacting Tillerson is Russia. Not only is Trump under fire for his seemingly cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tillerson himself has engaged in extensive business dealings with Russia in his position at Exxon. \nRelated: Secretary of State Nominee Rex Tillerson: Russian Hacking \"Clearly is Troubling\" \nAt his hearing, Tillerson refused to say that he'd support sanctions against Russia and he also refused to say that Putin was a war criminal for atrocities in Syria, a position widely held on Capitol Hill. \nAfter his confrontational questioning of Tillerson, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he's not sure if he'll support him. \n\"I mean there's a chance now to submit some questions in writing, which we'll do as well. I'll consider everything, I'll read through it and make a decision here very soon,\" Rubio told NBC News. \nRubio's support is critical. If Rubio were to join all the Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee to vote against Tillerson, he doesn't make it out of committee and his nomination dies. Even once the committee hurdle is cleared, a 52-48 edge in the full Senate doesn't give Republicans much wiggle room for a simple majority if Democrats vote in a bloc against any nominee. \nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who has been critical of Trump on Russia, said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that he also has reservations about Tillerson.

Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he is also \"troubled\" by Tillerson's testimony, including his refusal to acknowledge Russia's alleged war crimes and his refusal to denounce Philippine President Duterte's harsh and violent crackdown on drugs. Rex Tillerson appears at his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill. NBC News \nTrump has praised Duterte, saying he's handled drug abuse in his country the \"right way.\" \n\"I will be conducting additional research, asking further questions of Mr. Tillerson for the record - including reiterating my questions about his tax return information, and consulting with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle,\" Cardin said in a statement. \nBut the alternatives to the president-elect's nominee is also part of the decision making process for at least one Democrat on the committee. \n\"I've frankly been reflecting on, if not Mr. Tillerson, who else might President-elect Trump chose,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Conn, told MSNBC's \"Hardball.\" \n\"He conducted a sort of celebrity apprentice review process to come up with a nominee for secretary of state and he seriously considered Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton, and I try to imagine how they would have fared in today's confirmation hearing.\" Democrats Begin Lining Up Against Sessions \nAfter New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker broke precedent by testifying against his Senate colleague during the second day of the attorney general confirmation hearing Wednesday, Schumer announced he was opposing Sessions' nomination. While calling him a \"friend,\" the Democratic leader said Sessions isn't the right person to become the nation's top law enforcer. \n\"After reviewing his record and giving careful consideration to his answers during the hearing, I am not confident in Sen. Sessions' ability to be a defender of the rights of all Americans, or to serve as an independent check on the incoming administration,\" Schumer wrote.
