The film, based on the book of the same name, is set during the US \"space race\" against the then-Soviet Union and portrays segregation in the early 1960s and Civil Rights efforts of the time. \nSince both Black History Month and National Engineers Week occur in February, it would be great if during this month, the movie about African-American Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) pioneers – Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson – wins Best Picture award. \nThese women, referred to as computers at that time, performed math calculations manually until an early IBM mainframe computer was delivered to NASA. Vaughan, played by Spencer, trained herself to become a proficient computer programmer in FORTRAN programming language. Johnson, portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, formulated new equations that ensured man's safe entry into and return from space. \nAs the first African-American female at IBM to be appointed distinguished engineer, the movie \"Hidden Figures\" resonated with me. It highlighted, then shattered, stereotypes about women and minorities, and it showed the importance of awareness, advocacy, and empowerment by leaders. It also emphasized the importance of having the courage to be first and to influence others with a shared vision of achieving something greater. \nI have always loved math and science. In my native country, Trinidad, at the age of 14, I chose to pursue math and life sciences at my high school. \nAfter winning the graduating student award for mathematics at the City University of New York and doing graduate work at New York University, I have enjoyed a diverse and challenging career at IBM reinventing myself as the company has transformed itself. \nA career in STEM at IBM has afforded me many career choices. I've never stopped learning and applying scientific methods to solve diverse business problems. We question to understand, test hypotheses, experiment, and innovate to achieve amazing results for our clients and for the world. Look at Watson . \nWorking in STEM you're a hands-on contributor to something bigger than yourself, like cognitive computing . You’re part of a technical community, unified by common goals that transcend organizational, geographic, or political boundaries. A perfect example of this is our IBM Academy of Technology , to which I belong and where I partner with colleagues across the globe to create value beyond my job description. \nI've been lucky to have excellent STEM mentors to help guide my career and to work with some of the most innovative STEM Figures in history. \nAt university when working on assignments on a personal computer (PC), I never imagined that I would meet and collaborate with one of the inventors of the PC, IBM Fellow Mark Dean. Chieko Asakawa, another IBM Fellow, opened my mind to the possibilities of accessibility technology . \nOne of my early mentors said to me, “With success comes great responsibility.” For me this means I must advocate for others to earn appropriate recognition for their accomplishments and support them in the pursuit of their goals. \nI coach co-workers in STEM roles about achieving their career goals and on technology topics. I speak with new hires, women's groups and students on the \"Possibilities of Technology\" and how it's improving our world. \nBeyond the enjoyment of a STEM career, my message to students is: Don't let anyone stereotype you or limit your perception of what you can or cannot do. Be curious about ways in which STEM is changing the world around you. Despite color, gender, or country of origin, anyone who has the drive and is willing to learn and strive can have a successful career in STEM. Don't set artificial limits on yourself. Have the courage to be the first and bring others along with you. Be confident to be a trailblazer even if you don’t see role models ahead of you. \nThe early space pioneers, as portrayed in \"Hidden Figures,\" were going into space where man had never gone before. Any of us could be the \"first\" to make a difference with STEM. Someone has to be first, why shouldn’t it be you? \nDale Davis Jones is a Director in IBM Global Technology Services. A Distinguished Engineer since 2008, she is the first IBM African-American female employee to earn this rank. \nTo learn more about the STEM women in \"Hidden Figures,\" visit IBM .com/hiddenfigures or women at IBM , ibm.com/womenatibm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:49:24.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
