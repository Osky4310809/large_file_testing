Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nQuoting “senior American officials,” the New York Times is reporting that FBI director James Comey wants the Justice Department to publicly rebuke President Trump’s claim that the Obama administration wiretapped him. James Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to publicly reject Trump’s claim that Obama tapped his phones https://t.co/97TOnVKHrK pic.twitter.com/OePy5VK4Dn \n— NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) March 5, 2017 \nHere is the pull-quote: \nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department this weekend to publicly reject President Trump’s assertion that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trump’s phones, senior American officials said on Sunday. Mr. Comey has argued that the highly charged claim is false and must be corrected, they said, but the department has not released any such statement. \nAfter excoriating him at every turn for the past few months, the Left is suddenly falling back in love with Comey. Don't write Jim Comey off as the bad guy just yet… https://t.co/C5gvVzJ1B6 pic.twitter.com/l8UWqSwCIf", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T00:08:19.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
