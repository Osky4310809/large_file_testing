Daley announced Monday. \nThe new gift raises Lucas’ support for the initiative, which was launched last fall, to $20 million. \nThe fund provides an endowment for students from underrepresented communities who qualify for financial support. African American and Hispanic students in both undergraduate and graduate programs receive priority consideration for support and are known as George Lucas Scholars or Mellody Hobson Scholars.

Filmmaking is what I was created to do and this scholarship means I have fellowship, opportunity, and the ability to inspire younger filmmakers in my community to dream without limits.” \nMore than two-thirds of USC students receiving some kind of financial assistance. \nRead original story George Lucas Gives Another $10 Million to USC Film School for Student Diversity At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
