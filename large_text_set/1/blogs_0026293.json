Waiters scored 33-points on the night, hitting six three-pointers and leading the Heat over the Warriors, 105-102. His final three-pointer came with 0.6 seconds left putting the Heat ahead for good after Kevin Durant had tied the game.\nJust moments earlier, Waiters hit another three keeping the Warriors at bay. Pun intended.\nThis is the second game in a row that Dion Waiters has scored 33-points for the Heat. The second 33-point game for Waiters ties his career-high which set in the previous game. Miami is currently second to last in the Eastern Conference and have had an underwhelming year for the most part after losing Dwyane Wade in free agency and Chris Bosh due to health concerns. That said, they are now on a five-game winning streak and seem to have found somewhat of a groove.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T05:42:35.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
