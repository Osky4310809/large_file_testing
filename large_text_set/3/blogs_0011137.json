a subtle transition between inside and out is demonstrated with the balcony in which all the rooms share and lead onto. \nthe reverse of the property opens up to the south with a wall of curving windows \n\n\nin order to maintain a responsible environmental footprint, the property utilizes a ground source heat pump, a heat exchange system, and is topped with solar panels aiming to compensate for energy lost from the glazing. the south-facing site means natural light is constant and, during summer months, shading is offered as a result of the floors’ cantilevered positioning. with this, the property has balanced municipality requirements to result in a retro style architecture that at the same time, is both nostalgic and contemporary. \na visual connection is constant on both the ground and second floors \n\n\n‘the curved glass continuously wraps its way around the interior façade on both levels creating continuous views from one room to another. as well as a visual connection, an exterior balcony also creates the opportunity to easily walk from one space to the next without disruption. the glass reflections of the central tree continuously change and bounce around as one moves throughout the house and changes their perspective.’ – jacob van rijs, MVRDV co-founder \nrecessed lighting is installed above the service wall \nthis continuous wall serves as an entrance to the garage and staircase \nthe living room is fitted with a wall of closets that hide all domestic functions \na neutral color and material palette is maintained throughout \nthe bedrooms share a single balcony overlooking the courtyard and garden \nthe flat-roofed, cream-colored and curving character is a nod to modernist architecture from the 1930s \nMVRDV believes that ‘casa kwantes’ has the potential to become entirely self-sufficient \nthe 480 square meter private home is in rotterdam, the netherlands", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:12:19.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
