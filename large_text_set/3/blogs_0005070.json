Any suggestion is unequivocally false,” Kevin Lewis tweeted Saturday. \nIn a statement, Lewis continued, “A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.” As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.” 9 People Stopped at Airports Under Trump's Travel Ban (Photos) \nOn Jan. 27, President Donald Trump signed an executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ban is now tied up in courts, but Trump has announced plans for a new ban. \nThe first travel ban affected about 90,000 people . Here's an introduction to eight of them. \nMuhammad Ali Jr. \nLegendary boxer Muhammad Ali's son and his mother were stopped by immigration officials at the Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. \nCNN \nKhalilah Camacho-Ali was let go after showing officials a photo of her and her then-husband Muhammad Ali, but Muhammad Ali, Jr. was questioned for an hour and 45 minutes, according to the Los Angeles Times. \nWe can't say conclusively why the Alis were stopped, but the family's lawyer said that the officials kept asking Ali Jr. about his religion. (The elder Ali is pictured here with President George W. Bush, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom.) \nHameed Khalid Darweesh \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked for over 10 years as an interpreter for the U.S government in Iraq. \nAccording the the New York Times , Darweesh was detained at JFK airport for about 19 hours before he was allowed to enter the U.S. \n“What I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,” Darweesh told the Times. \nA 5-year-old boy \nA 5-year-old boy was detained for a few hours at Washington Dulles International Airport. \nAccording to the Independent , the boy is a U.S. citizen who lives with his Iranian mother in Maryland and was traveling with another family member at the time. \n“To assume that just because of someone’s age and gender that they don’t pose a threat would be misguided and wrong,” said White House press secretary Sean Spicer. \nAreej Ali \nThe 33-year-old software developer, a green-card holder, was detained in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and again in Los Angeles. She said she was returning from her sister's wedding in Sudan. \nHer family found a lawyer who noted that the ban did not apply to people with green cards, according to the Daily Bulletin. \nFusion \nMazdak Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam \nThis husband and wife are associate professors at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and both are permanent residents of the United States, but are Iranian in nationality. \nAccording to the Guardian , the two professors were coming back from a conference in France when they were stopped at Boston's Logan airport and questioned for four hours before being released. Getty \nSidd Bikkannavar \nThe U.S.-born Muslim scientist says he was detained under President Trump’s travel ban and forced by border agents to unlock his NASA-issued phone. \nBikkannavar is an employee at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was coming back from a trip in Patagonia when he was detained. Patagonia is a region in Argentina and Chile -- neither of which are among the countries covered by the travel ban. YouTube \nKhanon Mahindokht Azad \nAccording to the Guardian , Khanon Mahindokht Azad is a 78-year-old Iranian grandmother who visits the U.S. every now and then to see her kids -- who are U.S. citizens. \nAfter 27 hours of being detained at LAX, she was finally allowed into the country.
