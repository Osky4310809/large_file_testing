We dug into the social media outrage and found the source of the rumour: A vlogger named Jay Way who claimed in December to have told Apple about his idea for screenshot alerts. \nIOS 11 coming with iMessage screenshot alerts â Jay (@realjayway) December 14, 2016 \n@nina_mundy it has not been officially confirmed yet. But it was a idea my team and I brought to the engineers of apple - J.W â Jay (@realjayway) December 14, 2016 \nThere's no evidence that Apple is actually going to implement Way's idea. And it would be a huge change for Apple to addÂ something like this. Certain apps such as Snapchat do currently send notifications if you screenshot messages, but it's unlikely that Apple would build that into its own Messages app. \nThis isn't the first time that a rumour of an app adding screenshot notifications went viral on Twitter. In November people began claiming on Twitter that Instagram had started sending notifications if people screenshot photos. \nInstagram now tells you if someone takes a screenshot. Be careful đ pic.twitter.com/M3vd7MkQau â ă ¤ (@imWaavey) November 24, 2016 \nThat wasn't true. Instead, Instagram had introduced a feature where it sent a notification if someone screenshotted an expiring photo message sent directly to them. But the notification was vague, and people got confused. \nApple declined to comment on this story.
