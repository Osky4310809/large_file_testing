She was there! She was going by a different name, though, in order to fly under her evil stepsisters’ radar. Cinderella, aka Kate Bosworth, wore a stunning ocean-blue dress to the Oscars after-party, and our breath is nowhere to be found .\nBosworth wore a J. Mendel piece from the designer’s Fall 2017 collection. The teal gown has a 1950s flair to it with its giant tulle circle skirt. A black velvet belt accentuates Bosworth’s waist and the structured bodice shows off Bosworth’s figure while keeping with the vintage vibe.\nGetty Images / John Shearer And just look at the movement all that tulle provides! If we were Cinderella — oops, we mean Bosworth — we would be twirling around until someone dragged us home!\nGetty Images / Presley Ann Slack J. Mendel’s Instagram account posted a few photos of the dress before Bosworth showed it off on the red carpet. In this photo, we can see the teeny pleats ironed into the tulle to make the skirt even more voluminous.\nBelle of the ball. @gillesmendel #fall17 \nA post shared by J. Mendel (@j_mendel) on Feb 16, 2017 at 11:56am PST \nWe even got to see the dress being sewn together! Now that’s a “behind the seams” look! It's all happening... #nyfw #insidetheatelier #jmendel @gillesmendel \nA post shared by J. Mendel (@j_mendel) on Feb 10, 2017 at 3:50pm PST \nNote: The jury is still out as to whether J. Mendel’s team consists of little cartoon mice and birds. We’ll get back to you on that ASAP.\nPaired with her diamond necklace and matching earrings, Bosworth looks like a vintage fairy princess. ✨ OSCARS ✨ \nA post shared by Kate Bosworth (@katebosworth) on Feb 26, 2017 at 8:47pm PST \nEven though we know that Kate Bosworth is, in fact, Cinderella, her secret is safe with us. Once she’s found Prince Charming and reveals her true identity, we’ll just say “we told you so!”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:40:09.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
