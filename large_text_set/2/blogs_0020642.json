Draymond Green's Shut Up And Slam Jam Karate Basketball is part NBA Jam and part Double Dragon and it’s all perfect. \nWhen you start you get a brief backstory. Draymond Green is holding a charity basketball event at a rec center, but there’s one big problem: The center double-booked and there’s a karate demonstration going on! It’s okay, because Draymond has an idea.\nThe game has two teams, the Cobra Kings and the King Cobras. There are four players: Draymond Green, Chris Paul, Metta World Peace and Matthew Dellavedova, but Delly just gets called “others” in the cutscene.\nFrom there it’s pretty simple. You just run around kicking people to steal the ball and shoot hoops. Sometimes you like a kick up just right and hit someone in the junk.\nIt’s simple, it’s fun and people throw weapons onto the court so you can live out your dream of hitting Delly with a crowbar. It’s not just the game that makes this so fun, it’s the complete package. Excellent music, perfect cliched commentary. This isn’t going to be something you want to play over and over and over again, but it’s a great time waster while trapped in a cubicle.\nIf you need a little more convincing here’s the full game I played.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:28:01.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
