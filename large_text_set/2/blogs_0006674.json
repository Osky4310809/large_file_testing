She sang beautifully. \n“I think there was just too much, and life gave her too many choices, and she just didn’t make the right ones.

Her brother James runs a ski company and sister Santa is a writer. \nTara said they had a “privileged but normal” childhood. But her family were all high-achievers, with her dad was an Olympic skier.

I don’t know what a proper P-T is, but I have a feeling I might not be it.” \nHer dad met Patti when she was a chalet girl in Swiss resort Klosters. Patti was friends with Camilla Shand, now the Duchess of Cornwall, and the couple became pals with the Prince of Wales, who her dad Charles taught to ski when he was 14.

But it was also the start of her cocaine addiction. \n“I went to the Oscars and the Baftas,” Tara said. “It was like Christmas every day. The trouble is, it turned into a white Christmas.” Tara Palmer Tomkinson on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here (Photo: Rex Features) \nShe dated celebrities including Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall and Robbie Williams, and was briefly engaged to Greg Martin, son of Beatles producer Sir George, in 1999. \nPrior to that, her cocaine addiction became apparent when she gave a rambling interview to Frank Skinner. \nBut going into rehab in 2000 marked a turning point. In 2002 she was runner-up in I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and won over millions of viewers. \nTara said: “I’m extremely grateful to I’m A Celebrity because I was able to show that I’m a bit eccentric but I’m resilient, too.” \nBut just a few years later, Tara was pictured with a collapsed septum in her nose. She insisted it was the legacy of her pre-rehab usage and had surgery in 2006. \nA year later she had another reality TV triumph on Comic Relief Does Fame Academy.

Tara had another operation to fix her septum in 2010, but maintained she had not returned to cocaine. \nShe later went back into rehab, to treat anxiety and depression. And in 2014, Tara told The Jeremy Kyle Show she was living like a recluse as a result of anxiety. \nThe same year she also claimed she had been diagnosed with a form of autism which “could explain why I’ve always lived my life at such a frantic level”. Tara on I'm A Celeb (Photo: Rex Features) \nTara added: “I was even given Ritalin as a child to make me concentrate. No one could understand why I behaved a certain way.” \nLater in 2014 she was arrested at Heathrow Airport over a fracas when she was refused entry to the first-class lounge. Tara denied claims she was drunk and insisted she had a panic attack. \nMet Police confirmed a woman in her 40s had been found dead at Tara’s address in South Kensington, South West London. A statement added: “Police are not treating the death as suspicious.” Tara with Prince Charles and Denise Van Outen (Photo: Reuters) \nIn November, Tara revealed she had tumour in her pituitary gland and a condition where abnormal antibodies attack the body’s cells and tissue. But she said: “I’m 100% determined to get better. \n“I’m like Alice In Wonderland. I fall down the rabbit hole... then, just as I poke my head out the top, I fall back down again. But I will get out.” \nTragically, Tara never really escaped her own wonderland.
