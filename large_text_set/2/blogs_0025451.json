Use these to impress your friends over the weekend. \nLove her or hate her, Katy Perry 's infectious pop songs have made her a household name. We dare you to read these five facts about Katy Perry without getting \"California Girls\" stuck in your head. Her Hair isn't Naturally Blue \n(source) \nKaty Perry doesn't have naturally blue hair. She doesn't even have naturally black hair. Despite sporting her trademark Bette Page-esque black hair, Perry is a natural blonde. And while we're at it, her real name isn't Katy Perry either. It's Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson. The singer took her her mother's maiden name so she wouldn't get confused with the already established actress Kate Hudson. So is she just full of lies She's Written Hits for Other Artists \n(source) \nOf course Katy Perry's penned hits for herself, but she's has also written hits for other artists. \"I Do Not Hook Up\" by Kelly Clarkson, \"Rock God\" and \"That's More Like It\" by Selena Gomez and the Scene, and \"Black Widow\" by Iggy Azalea were all written by Katy Perry. Her Favorite Song isn't One of Her Own \n(source) \nReportedly, Katy Perry's favorite song to sing to in the car is \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\" by Whitney Houston. But when she was asked what her favorite song to have sex to is, she responded with \"Often\" by The Weekend or \"The Macarena\". TMI, Katy Perry. TMI. She's Been in the Movies \n(source) \nKaty Perry's voice has appeared in movies, and not just on the soundtrack. She was the voice of Smurfette in The Smurfs , and has also appeared as herself on an episode of The Young and the Restless and Zoolander 2 . So if the whole singer/songwriter thing doesn't work for her, she always has a back up plan! She's a Barbie Doll \n(source) \nIn December 2011, one single Katy Perry Barbie doll was made and auctioned off to raise money for the Project Angel Food foundation. The doll wore a dress with 70 hand-painted cupcakes on it, and Swarovski crystal fishnets. And that doll is probably worth more than most people. \nWhat's your favorite Katy Perry song?
