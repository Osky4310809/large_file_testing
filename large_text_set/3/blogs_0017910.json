Joining the likes of the new TomGeorge and Little Sister as of March 15 is So Long, Hi , nestled right between Bottega Louie and B.S. Taqueria. Taking over the former Thai restaurant Soi7, So Long, Hi also takes inspiration from Thailand with a focus on Chiang Mai street food and a colorful interior modeled after Phuket’s Lard Yai street. The brainchild of David Tewasart (Sticky Rice, Side Chick ) and Bryan Sharafkhah-Sharp ( White Guy Pad Thai ), the fun-loving eatery takes a cue from places like Button Mash and Double Take by offering a pool table, photobooth, a \"nothing fancy but solid beers\" bar. That means there will be plenty of cold Singha, Chang, and PBRs to sip under the shade of faux mini palm trees and Chang umbrellas in the astroturfed patio. On the menu is everything from street food bites like homemade pork sausage and Thai jerky to more traditional plates, making it quite the place to get your pad Thai and crying tiger beef fix. So Long, Hi is open daily from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m., with a weekday \"Dirt Cheap Happy Hour\" from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. featuring $2 beers and $6 bar bites. Check out the full menu below.
