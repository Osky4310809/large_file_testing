In October, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach reversed his convictions and ordered a new trial.\nOn Wednesday, Statewide Prosecutor Nick Cox notified defense attorney Mitch Stone that he had dropped the charges rather than go to the expense and trouble of another trial.\nThe original one lasted three weeks. It was held in Sanford .\nMathis had maintained from the start that he did not break the law. He said he was merely a lawyer to a nonprofit, Allied Veterans of the World, that opened a chain of legitimate internet cafes.\nCox, though, argued that what Allied Veterans was a poorly disguised string of casinos that generated $300 million in illegal revenue.\nInside each storefront were personal computers equipped with software that allowed users to convert them into virtual slot machines, prosecutors said.\nIn March 2013, law enforcement officers statewide raided and shut down more than 50 Allied storefronts. They also arrested more than 50 people, including Mathis, Allied executives and franchise holders.\nProsecutors dropped charges against many of the defendants. Other defendants entered pretrial diversion programs. A few were placed on probation.\nOnly Mathis went to trial.\nThe criminal investigation was led by the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office, with the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\nAt Mathis’ trial, Cox argued that Allied was not really a nonprofit, but Mathis insisted that it was and that it followed state regulations governing sweepstakes and contests.\nStone said Wednesday evening that Mathis has not been able to practice law since his conviction in 2013, but added that he hoped the suspension of his Florida Bar license would be lifted soon.\nThe legal battle, he said, had cost Mathis, who was the former president of the Jacksonville Bar Association, more than his life savings.\n“It’s cost him every bit of money he ever earned. It cost him his law practice, his marriage,” Stone said. “He’s rebuilding his life.”\nrstutzman@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6394.\n Trials and Arbitration Crime Sanford Seminole County", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58c45baa/turbine/os-police-are-searching-for-two-subjects-involved-in-deltona-shooting-20170311", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58befd71/turbine/sns-judge-blocks-fbi-from-forcing-fi-20170307", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58c9a7bb/turbine/os-seminole-high-school-student-shot-outside-school-20170315", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58cb2272/turbine/os-internet-cafe-kelly-mathis-retrial-20170313", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58caafb8/turbine/os-video-state-attorney-will-no-longer-pursue-death-penalty-20170316", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58c87750/turbine/os-ex-apopka-official-loses-challenge-of-phone-search-in-hit-and-run-case"], "published": "2017-03-16T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T02:20:19.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
