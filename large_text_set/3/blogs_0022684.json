Devin Nunes said communications by members of the president's transition team, and possibly by Donald Trump himself, were included in incidental monitoring. By Alan Neuhauser , Staff Writer | March 22, 2017, at 2:53 p.m. Cancel House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., spoke with reporters Wednesday at the Capitol. J. Scott Applewhite/AP \nThe top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee said Wednesday he has confirmed that the intelligence community incidentally collected information about people associated with the Trump transition and that \"it is possible\" that the information collection could have extended to the president himself. \nRep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., made the statements during a briefing with reporters Wednesday, stating that he had reviewed \"dozens\" of foreign intelligence reports that had been shared with him. The reports were from after the election in November, December and January, he said, adding that they were the product of what appeared \"legal\" foreign surveillance activities not related to a criminal investigation. RELATED CONTENT [RELATED: Comey: FBI Investigating Trump-Russia Ties ] \n\"On numerous occasions, the intelligence community did collect information on American citizens involved in the Trump transition team,\" Nunes said, reading from a prepared statement. \nNunes emphasized that the reports he had reviewed were not related to Russia. The FBI director confirmed Monday that the bureau was investigating ties between Trump associates and the Russian government. \nNunes spoke after meeting with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and he said he would brief the White House on the reports later Wednesday. \nAs recently as last week, the chairman had said that it was \"possible\" that President Donald Trump's communications were recorded by surveillance, but Wednesday's disclosure marked the first time the chairman did so with evidence of broader monitoring activities that apparently swept up communications by Trump associates. \nNunes, asked whether the communications included any from Trump himself, initially responded, \"yes,\" then clarified, stating, \"It's possible. We won't know until we get the information and get to the bottom of it.\" \nAsked a few minutes later whether the president's communications were included, or whether it was simply possible that they were, Nunes responded, \"I just don't know the answer to that,\" adding, \"I know there was incidental collection involving the president-elect and his team. I don't know if it was actually physically a phone call.\" \nTrump had claimed on Twitter on March 4 that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance. Nunes, asked Monday whether the reports stemmed from any monitoring of Trump Tower, said, \"We don't know yet.\" \nNunes gave particular attention to what's known as \"unmasking\" â€“ when the identity of an American citizen who is included in a foreign surveillance report gets shared within the intelligence community. The White House and congressional Republicans have been sharply critical of the unmasking of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was identified in foreign surveillance reports after meeting with Russia's U.S. ambassador during the presidential transition. Flynn's identity and the meetings were apparently subsequently leaked to the press. \nNunes, on Wednesday, said it appeared that other Trump associates had also been unmasked. \n\"Details about U.S. persons involved in the incoming administration with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reports,\" Nunes said in his prepared statement. \nHe later elaborated, saying of the reports, \"I'm actually alarmed by it.\" Alan Neuhauser Staff Writer \nAlan Neuhauser covers law enforcement and criminal justice for U.S. News & World Report.
