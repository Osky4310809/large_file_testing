It was way back in 1999, when Rakesh, Sukh Nijjar, Shai Tank and Harvey Mann - four fans from different parts of England who regularly met at India's matches - founded the Bharat Army. Three years later, they embarked on their first tour, to the West Indies - where they 'shot to fame' and formed the fan group. \nThese are men from different walks of life, united by their passion for the sport. The motive behind coming together and the objective of the group is rather simple, explains Rakesh. \"As a country that lives for the game and supports the team around the world with so much passion, we felt the need to have a recognised supporters group which would be Team India's 12th man in the field.\" \n\"Our objective is simple, we would like to ensure wherever Team India are playing around the world, we The Bharat Army have a presence in the stadium supporting Team India. We have had a presence at all major ICC Tournaments now since 1999 and we hope to extend this presence further into the Test arena as well.\" \nIt's never easy to form a dedicated fan group that travels around the world to support a side. And when this group began, the Indian cricket team wasn't at the peak of their performances, thus dimming the enthusiasm. But they've seen brighter days since. \n\"The early years when we formed were tough as Team India was not so successful, therefore the appetite to be part of a supporters group that travelled the world supporting the team wasn't really there. However, as the team has become more and more successful, our membership has grown and our following has got bigger and bigger. We now have an online presence across all social media which has made a big difference on how our followers engage and discuss aspects on Indian cricket,\" Rakesh reveals. \n\"We now have over 60,000 followers across our various platforms and regularly take large groups of members from around world to various tournament and series to be part of the Bharat Army experience.\" \nThe Bharat Army website lists out being a 'unique voice of Indian cricket fans' as an objective, but that's easier said than done. For a fan base that can idolise and abhor its national cricketers with equal dedication, it is a herculean task to find a common voice. Rakesh has his vision in place, albeit an ambitious one. \n\"In the past when an Indian team hasn't been so successful, we have seen over-the-top reactions from fans around the world... burning of effigies, stoning players homes etc. We hope to change the mindset of fans to support the team and its players through good times and the bad. \n\"We also hope to achieve a sense of togetherness and patriotism through the game we love. Our Bharat Army anthem we sing in the stands Yeh Dosti hum nahi todenge. Our motto has never changed, Win Lose or Draw we will support you forever more,\" he explains. \nWhile the vision is in place, the growth of the fan club has also been sizeable. They're now providing packages for fans through a tie-up with the ICC. \"As our following has increased, the appetite to be part of The Bharat Army experience at a tournament has also increased so we decided to partner with the ICC as a Travel & Tours Provider for the Champions Trophy 2017. \n\"The response has been phenomenal and we have members travelling to England from Hong Kong, Singapore, Chicago, New York, Germany, Holland, Dubai, Ireland and, of course, India...basically all over the world. We hope to have up-to 2000 Bharat Army members at each of India's games during the Champions Trophy.\" \nThe expectations that they set for themselves is rather high, but so is the quality of work towards achieving it. Rakesh and the other three founders have come a long way since conceptualising the idea nearly two decades ago, but the path ahead and the achievements anticipated keeps them on their toes and excited. There are still two big objectives that Rakesh & Co. are yet to tick off. \n\"Our objective is to be recognised by the BCCI as Team India's Official Supporters Group. We know the players in the Team value our support and regularly receive tweets and messages from them thanking us for our support - but it would be great to collaborate with the BCCI to gain that Official status. \n\"I'd also like The Bharat Army to be recognised as the No.1 Supports Groups around the world for any sport.\" © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T12:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T08:11:22.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
