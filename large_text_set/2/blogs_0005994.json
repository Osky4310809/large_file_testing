He became obsessed with portraying Martin Luther King Jr., and seven years later Selma became a breakout triumph for him and director Ava DuVernay. Now, years after getting wind of the true story behind A United Kingdom and vowing to bring it to the screen, he's starring in this rousing mid-twentieth-century saga, directed by Amma Asante. Everyone involved is building on prior success. Asante's widely admired previous film, Belle , positioned her to work here on a larger scale in every way. Oyelowo is coming off his marvelous turn last fall as a Ugandan chess coach in director Mira Nair's underappreciated Disney gem, Queen of Katwe . And perhaps most impressively, Rosamund Pike follows her grand success as wife-from-hell Amy Dunne in Gone Girl with a warm, winning portrayal of the most opposite type imaginable.   Oyelowo is Seretse Khama, who will eventually become the first democratically elected president of Botswana, the landlocked, peaceable, and prosperous nation that encompasses most of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. In 1947, however, Khama is the orphaned crown prince of the Bangwato nation and is finishing off some 20 years of education in England by earning a law degree; he's preparing to assume the kingship that has been loyally preserved all this time by the regency of his beloved uncle. Rosamund Pike is Ruth Williams, a classic English rose, daughter of a shopkeeper, who has an independent streak, to say the least. She meets Khama at a dreary Missionary Society dance in London that her sister has dragged her to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:19:10.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
