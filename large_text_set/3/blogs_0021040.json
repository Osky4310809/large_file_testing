The three-year veteran has been part-sounding board, part instructor in his mentorship since general manager John Idzik drafted Smith in the second round four months ago. \nAlthough Smith and Mark Sanchez have a good relationship, the rookie’s reliance on McElroy, who has been removed from the Jets’ starting quarterback competition, has been invaluable in his development. \n2012 : Advertisement \n[Greg] McElroy says Sanchez has taught him a great deal about playing quarterback, and that he’ll try to emulate Sanchez this week. \n“Everything that I’ve learned at this position in this league has been from Mark,” McElroy said, in comments distributed by the Jets’ PR staff. “He’s the guy that I’ve seen every day. Every day that I’ve been an NFL player, I’ve been looking up to him. I’ve been observing him and trying to follow after his lead. I’ve been watching him. I understand how to play this game because of him.” \n2011 : Advertisement \nLike any pro athlete, Brunell told me he’d rather be the starter—“every backup at every position would rather be playing”—but he is at peace with his role as Mark Sanchez’ mentor. \n“I see it as a mentoring role,” said [Mark] Brunell, who turns 40 in September. “He’s a great kid, a hard worker. He has ability, and this is a critical year for him.” \nBrunell sees a little of himself in Mark Sanchez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:27:33.666+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
