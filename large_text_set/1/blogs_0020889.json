Family devastated \nThree months after the crash, Ward became pregnant with her son. \nJudge Geoffrey Mercer told her that Mr Platt 's death has had a \"devastating effect\" on his family and friends. \n\"Quite simply, you should not have been driving,\" he said, but he added courts were \"reluctant to send the mother of a young child to prison\". \nHe said: \"Your son is five months old and I am just persuaded for that reason and that reason alone I can properly suspend this sentence.\" \nMr Platt's family said they did not want to comment after the sentence. \nWard was also given a curfew for four months and banned from driving for four years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T00:50:45.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
