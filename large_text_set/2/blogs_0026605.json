The app was developed by an independent studio Flyperinc which previously specialized in mobile productivity tools and has already released well-received Android apps like Flyperlink and Flychat. Flyperinc’s latest creation launched on the Google Play Store a while ago and should now be available for download worldwide. The app can be installed for free and features some ads that appear on the bottom of its interface. It also ships with a single, $0.99 in-app purchase that provides you with access to some extra functionalities and eliminates the ads. \nCornerfly doesn’t require root and works on virtually all devices running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and newer iterations of Google’s operating system. As expected, the primary purpose of the app is to round the corners of your display regardless of the device you’re using. As expected, Cornerfly needs a permission to act as an overlay and access the Android Accessibility Services. After it’s been allowed to do so, the app works instantly, though the free version only supports a single look. If you opt to pay $0.99 to upgrade to the premium version of Cornerfly, you’ll be able to modify the degree to which the app will round the corners of your screen. Note that you can still test the option to modify your corners without paying anything. The image above depicts the maximum degree of rounding Cornerfly can currently perform. \nFurthermore, the app even allows you to set specific looks for individual apps so you can opt to minimize or even turn off its effect entirely when launching certain apps, and highlight it when using others. Naturally, it’s probably fair to say that Cornerfly produces the best effect when used on a phone with a black case like the Galaxy S7 Edge that can be seen above as the unused corners of the screen don’t stick out from the rest of the device. The app seems rather lightweight and shouldn’t leave a significant battery footprint. In fact, you may even save some battery life if you use Cornerfly on a device with an AMOLED display panel that doesn’t light up black pixels, though any potential savings probably won’t be large enough for you to notice a difference in everyday use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T19:34:30.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
