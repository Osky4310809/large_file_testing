It’s unclear if this is specific to the NVIDIA Shield TV, or if it’s something that is supported because of the new Nougat update that both of these devices have. Either way, we’re seeing reports from users that say it’s working with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One S controllers directly over Bluetooth.\nHowever, you should be aware that there are steps to take in order to get it to pair properly. One person says you’ll need to connect the controller to the NVIDIA Shield TV via a USB cable at first. Once the controller is connected to the set-top box, you should then open up the Settings application on the NVIDIA Shield TV. From here, scroll down a bit and the PlayStation 3 controller should be listed with Bluetooth symbol. Once that connection has been made, you can then disconnect the controller and play a game using the controller over Bluetooth.\nAnother person says you’ll need to put the PlayStation 4 controller into pairing mode by pressing and holding the PS and share button until it starts to blink. From here, you’ll want to launch the Settings application on the NVIDIA Shield TV and then go to Add Accessory. You should see the PlayStation controller listed there so you can select it and complete the connection. You’ll then want to press and hold the PS button for about 10 seconds whenever you want to turn it off.\nWe’ve seen these controllers work with Android devices in the past, but we often had to have root access and the Sixaxis application in order to set them up properly. We’ve also seen the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One S controllers connect to Android devices with a simple OTG cable as well. But it’s nice to see these controllers are finally connecting to Android TV devices natively over Bluetooth now, this should make the NVidia Shield TV an even better device for all things gaming.\nSource: /r/Android ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T17:07:16.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
