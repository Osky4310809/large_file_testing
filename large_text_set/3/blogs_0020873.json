This year, we’ve decided that it’s time to shed some light about these accounts. Who are John Doe and Jane Doe? \nBoth John Doe and Jane Doe accounts were created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in the early days of Roblox for testing purposes . These dummy accounts did not belong to any one player, and as such, they were given the placeholder names “John Doe” and “Jane Doe.” John Doe and Jane Doe are two of Roblox’s earliest accounts, as seen by their low user IDs here. \nFor all intents and purposes, both accounts are owned and maintained by Roblox . They cannot be used in any way to access or ban other players’ accounts, and they’re positively harmless. We promise that they’re friendly. You may even see John or Jane Doe popping into a game some time to say hello and wish everyone well. Clarifying John Doe/Jane Doe’s Friends, Followers, and Badges \nA few years ago, we observed that some players could add John Doe and Jane Doe to their friends and followers lists on Roblox or award these test accounts with badges. We have since disabled this ability. \nIn the following weeks, we will be clearing out both accounts from any friends or badges that were added involuntarily, and John and Jane Doe will also be outfitted with a new set of Roblox-branded clothes. Introducing the new John Doe and Jane Doe Protecting Your Roblox Account \nAuthentic John Doe and Jane Doe accounts pose no danger to your Roblox account . Still, we always encourage players to proactively defend their account by setting up 2-Step Verification or using a strong password that cannot be easily guessed. \nLearn more about how to keep your Roblox account safe by reading this blog post here . \nWe’re dedicated to building a fun, safe environment where kids of all ages can power their imagination on Roblox. We hope that this blog post helps to put an end to the misconceptions about John Doe and Jane Doe, and that it alleviates any concerns or worries. Consider this myth busted.
