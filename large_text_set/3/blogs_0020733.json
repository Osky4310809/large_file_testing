The press secretary answered questions on the president’s optimism about the American Health Care Act before it goes to a vote Thursday. (Photo: JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) On the health care vote Thursday \n“I think the meeting this morning really was a huge sign of support,” Spicer said. “There was a lot of enthusiasm, not just for the bill itself, but for a more patient centric healthcare system. The president has continued to engage with members. He will continue to do that through Thursday.” \nWill there be more changes? “It’s possible,” Spicer said. “I don’t want to rule anything out.” \n“He continues to meet with members and walk away with a very optimistic view of where the bill is headed. Keep in mind: If you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance.” \nSpicer said he thinks Republicans will “pay a price at home” in 2018 if they don’t repeal the Affordable Care Act. \n“I think it’s a political reality. If you go out and promise voters something on a scale like this…This is something that as a party we have made very clear. To go and make a pledge of this magnitude and not to follow it through…The president earned high marks for keeping his word.” \n“We’re going to make sure we remember those that stood by us.” On if there is a lack of progress with his legislative agenda \n“As we continue through the months, one report is not something to base an entire record off of.” \nMentioning the budget proposal, Spicer said, “We are well on our way to seeing this agenda done.” On if the president will address his wiretapping claims this week, like he said he would \n“We’ll see how the week goes.” On the proposal of a carbon tax \n“I think there is a robust debate going on with respect to comprehensive tax reform. Our goal right now is to get through Thursday. We need to get Obamacare repealed and replaced to move on to trade reform. Obviously there is a lot of people who recognize we haven’t had comprehensive tax reform since 1986.” On the report that an immigrant student raped a 14-year-old girl at school \n“This is a tragic event,” he said. “It’s horrendous and horrible and disgusting what this young woman went through. Let’s remember the human side of this — that this is a tragic event. Schools should be a place where a parent knows their child is safe. The idea that this occurred is shocking, disturbing, horrific and whatever other words that come to mind.” \nWill it affect the president’s immigration policies? “This is why he’s passionate about this. Because people are victims of these crimes. Immigration pays its toll on our people.” On electronics being banned on flights to the U.S. from ten airports \nSpicer read a prepared statement and said, “We are aware the terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation.” \n“That being said, I’m not going to go any further on that, and I would refer any comment to TSA.” \nHe explained that he ban takes 96 hours to go into effect so airports can be provided with appropriate notification. On Ivanka Trump getting an office in the West Wing \n“Even though she’s not a federal employee, she will follow the ethics rules as if she were.” On North Korea \nSpicer said the administration is “exploring a new range of diplomatic and security measures” because of the threat of their ballistic missile program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:35:39.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
