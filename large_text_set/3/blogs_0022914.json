The president, Muhammadu Buhari (pictured, left), recently spent six weeks seeking medical treatment in London. And the country continues to be roiled by Boko Haram jihadists in the north-east and by unrelated militants’ attacks on oil facilities in the Niger delta. Yet investors don’t seem to mind: last month Nigeria issued a 15-year, $1bn eurobond—a bond in a currency other than that of the country issuing it—that was eight times oversubscribed. A second issuance is expected, possibly this month. It will probably be met with similar enthusiasm. What makes investing in Nigeria so attractive?\nNigeria is benefiting from pent-up demand for African sovereign debt. Emerging markets started last year on a very bad footing: depressed currencies, looming interest-rate increases and uncertainty over British and American votes put investors off risky trades. African sovereign bonds suffered more than most. Yields—which move inversely to prices—peaked in February. They dropped gradually throughout the year, but too slowly for many nations to borrow at affordable rates: only three sub-Saharan governments—South Africa, Mozambique and Ghana—sold dollar-denominated debt in 2016. Yet with interest rates in the developed world still low, asset managers remain hungry for returns. Credit funds focused on emerging markets received nearly $10bn in the first two months of this year, almost double the amount pulled out of them in the same period last year, according to EPFR Global, a research firm.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:00:06.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
