But what is serious is that the former publisher of a hate site that has embraced the alt-right and talked openly of destroying American institutions is pulling the strings in the Oval Office.” \nBannon was executive chair of Breitbart news , which he described as the “platform of the alt-right”. He has also been widely quoted as describing himself as “a Leninist ... [he] wanted to destroy the state and that’s my goal too”. \nHendrix said of his postcard campaign: “People are creative – I’ve seen people post photos of handmade cards, for instance. One lady made 30 of them in one night . I think it’s cathartic.” The Hummingbird (@Alifaith55) HAVE YOU SENT YOUR #PostcardsToBannon ?Trumpy doesn't like it when we send mail to the \"real\" president February 8, 2017 \nOne account, @Note2PresBannon, has also got behind the campaign. The person who runs it, who wishes to remain anonymous, said they began writing the postcards on their own out of frustration before joining with others sharing their missives on the internet.
