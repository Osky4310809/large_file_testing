The stunning former model gave us a taste of her classic sense of style at a recent Harper’s Bazaar event, and we couldn’t keep our eyes off her! Not only did her rock a mean 1970s glam look with her makeup and dress, she showed us all what being 50 and fabulous truly looks like. \nYep, you read that right. The Frida actress turned the big 5-0 towards the end of 2016, but doesn’t look a day over 30. From her flawless skin to her fit shape, Salma Hayek served epic #lifetimegoals on the red carpet. \nSalma Hayek’s dress is to die for.
