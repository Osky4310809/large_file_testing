John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) criticized Republicans for bringing the bill to the floor so soon.\n“I’m surprised that without hearings, without opportunity for amendment, we are now considering a measure that has this much opposition,” he said.\nThe American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC), which claims to represent a network of more than 250,000 businesses, sent a letter to members of the House on Wednesday urging them to oppose this “anti-regulatory” measure.\n“This would be like taking a chainsaw into surgery,” David Levine, ASBC’s CEO and co-founder, said in a statement.\n“Businesses depend on good regulations to set clear boundaries and rules for fair competition on a level playing field.”\nInstead, Levine claims that the Midnight Rules Relief Act would enable Congress to undo batches of rules without any consideration of their individual merits.\nWhile debating the bill on the floor Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) appealed to the freshman class of the new Congress.\nIssa informed new lawmakers that Congress has only once, in 2001, successfully repealed a rule by way of a resolution under the Congressional Review Act.\n“All this legislation does is allow for us to dispose of one or more regulations in an expedited fashion in this body and have it seen in the same form in the Senate,” he said. “It doesn’t change the underlying law.”\nHe explained that the House, the Senate and the president all have to agree on the resolution to repeal a rule.\n“Only one regulation has ever been repealed,” he said. “It’s been 16 years and the few that will likely be considered under this act and underlying law will be just that, a relatively few regulations that are believed to be unnecessary on which the House, Senate and president concur.”\nFreedom Partners, a DC based free market non-profit, issued a statement on the passage of the bill:\n“The Obama regulatory agenda is like economic quicksand for American businesses and workers; the more they try to get ahead, the harder this administration works to pull them back down. Freedom Partners strongly supports these positive first steps to put important checks on government overreach and give appropriate scrutiny to regulations that threaten further damage to our economy. Americans called for an end to business as usual last November — Congress shouldn’t waste any time delivering on that promise.”\nThe Midnight Rule Relief Act would allow Congress to disapprove of multiple so-called “midnight rules”— regulations finalized in the waning days of the administration—using a single Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, as opposed to disapproving of these rules individually.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/05/house-passes-bill-to-allow-for-repeal-of-obama-midnight-regulations/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/homenews/house/312730-house-passes-bill-to-overturn-midnight-regulations-en-masse"], "published": "2017-01-05T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:42:00.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
