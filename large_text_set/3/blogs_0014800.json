Granted, it balances them out with easy, wearable staples fit for any guy’s closet, but often, the best stuff in its collections are the statement-making garments that draw the right kind of attention. \nFor Spring/Summer 2017, Scotch & Soda takes the idea of a tropical locale and filters it through the lens of a bustling cityscape. Colorful snakes, verdant palm trees, and globally-inspired prints may be the type of thing you’d imagine in a resort town, but in the context of a stylish metropolis, they add just the right amount of contrast. \nTo help you find some of this season’s best garms, here are our top picks from Scotch & Soda’s latest collection: The Statement Trousers \nOne of our favorite pieces is the Owen lightweight jacquard trousers. Cut with wider, cropped legs and a comfortable elastic band, these patterned pants would look great with a pair of crisp white sneakers and an oversized solid tee. Buy It Now The Well-Traveled Jacket \nThe unlined Structured Shirt Jacket is a little less bold with its black-and-white jacquard pattern, but takes the classic patch-pocket chore coat and filters it through a well-traveled sensibility. Versatile enough to upgrade shorts and tee, it can also upgrade a pair of slim chinos and a crewneck sweatshirt. Buy It Now The Go-Anywhere Pants \nDressing up all the time overrated, but if you do it right, smarter pieces elevate your whole look without sacrificing easy-wearing comfort. One of the simplest ways to add a little more class to your ‘fit is with a great pair of trousers. The Blake Structured Pleated Trousers combine the elastic waistband of your favorite sweats with a clean leg and straight pleat that extends all the way to them, toeing the line between cozy track pants and classy suit pants. Buy It Now The Warm-Weather Sweater \nThe secret to springtime knitwear are loose-gauge sweaters made of breathable materials. They’re meant more for breezy transitional days or chilly nights. Scotch & Soda’s colorful Structured Sweater is made from a cotton/polyester blend, and features a timely forest green color with bright contrasts and subtle hits of patterns. Buy It Now The Street-Ready Trench Coat \nTaking cues from lightweight outerwear and vintage military gear, the Amsterdams Blauw Trench Coat features patchwork panels in versatile tones of tan and olive green. A hidden placket adds a minimal touch, and the welted chest pocket is the perfect place to store stuff like sunglasses and a smartphone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:15:59.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
