Win them both, and we can tie blue ribbons around the trophy. \nDiego Costa decorated his 100th appearance for Chelsea with his 15th goal of the season and his 52nd for the club in all. \nAfter his brief falling-out with pied piper Conte over a back injury which coincided with big-money interest from China, it was a decisive step towards reconciliation. \nBy the time he was withdrawn, four minutes from time, Costa's adoring flock had cheered his name to the rafters before kick-off, celebrated his goal like party animals and sent him on his way with a standing ovation. \nAll hissy-fits forgiven, the hero of the hour departed with a presidential wave to all four sides of Stamford Bridge. It just had to be him, didn't it? (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nConte had promised he was willing to “put my hands in the fire” for Costa, but he didn't get his fingers burned this time. \nChelsea had to dig deeper than expected, but just look at the table. They are not just sitting pretty, they are sitting beauty queens. \nHull we can deal with in short measure. Under new management, they did not look like a struggling team. \nCentral defender Harry Maguire, rampaging forward like a bull elephant trampling across your pristine front lawn, was arguably the best player on the pitch, and he exercised Thibaut Courtois with a thunderous shot from distance and an emphatic header. \nBut Costa was not to be denied, and when volunteers were required to break the deadlock, it just had to be him... didn't it? Costa opened the scoring in the first half... (Photo: Getty Images Europe) ... and gave a cheeky celebration (Photo: Reuters) \nOur favourite firebrand had already seen a goal wrongly disallowed for offside when he struck in nine minutes of first-half stoppage time following the sickening clash of heads between Cahill and Mason. \nWhile the Tigers midfielder was detained at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington in an acute trauma unit, Hull coped well until Victor Moses surged to the dead-ball line and Costa swept home his low cut-back from around the penalty spot. \nHull were the first-ever visitors to Stamford Bridge in 1905, when they copped a 5-1 defeat, and you can see why they have never won here in the League. \nShortly after the restart, Marcos Alonso chopped down Abel Hernandez in the box with impunity. \nNo penalty, said referee Neil Swarbrick – a poor decision which left Tigers manager Marco Silva frowning: “It's for you to talk about the referee and these situations. I'm not happy with the result because we tried to take points and compete, but it was not a bad performance.” View gallery \nChelsea, content to contain and destroy, had to wait until 10 minutes from time to make the points safe, Cahill rising unmarked to head home a free-kick from substitute Cesc Fabregas at the far post. \nCosta was denied by the sprawling Eldin Jakupovic, but it would have been a travesty if Hull had suffered further collateral damage. \nConte admitted: “For sure this wasn't our best game, but the points now are heavy for us but also for the other teams below us.” \nNo disrespect to Conte, Costa and Chelsea – but right now, who cares? \nGet well soon, Ryan Mason.
