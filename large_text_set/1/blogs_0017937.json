Trade is the best tool we have to fight poverty and promote growth. However, trade needs to be more inclusive, transparent and values-based,” EU’s Malmström said. \nRoberto Azevêdo, director-general of the World Trade Organization, said: “We should not talk ourselves into a trade war.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T02:19:25.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
