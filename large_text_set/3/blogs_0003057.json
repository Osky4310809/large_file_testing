Instagram just copied yet another feature from Snapchat.\nInstagram updated its apps Tuesday with a new \"geostickers\" feature in Stories that is nearly the same as — you guessed it — Snapchat's geofilters.\nSEE ALSO: Get ready to see less #ad and #spon on Instagram\nDebuting first in New York City and Jakarta, Indonesia, the new stickers are tied to specific neighborhoods and landmarks within those cities and are \"designed to match the vibe of the location.\"\nImportantly, unlike Snapchat's filters, which are largely user-generated, Instagram's geostickers appear to be designed by Instagram — at least for now. It seems likely the company will eventually open up the stickers to more cities, at which point it could expand the sticker collection as well.\nThe stickers themselves live in the stickers section of Stories. The app already had some location-based stickers, though the new \"geostickers\" are tied specifically to landmarks and neighborhoods, rather than just a city. (Instagram says each city currently has \"more than a dozen\" geostickers available.)\nAnother notable difference between Instagram's geostickers and Snapchat's geofilters: Instagram's stickers link to the app's location pages. So, tapping on, say, a Brooklyn sticker in a story will take you to Instagram's location page for Brooklyn.\nWATCH: These tattoos conduct electricity, turning you into a very basic cyborg", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2Yo34ucnq-Kouvj4WWjup1l-8LM=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F406387%2F115d51a3-9e1a-4bcf-b295-a8287d9a5596.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NFHnzbqheAfl-8SMVu0Bh8HE2cI=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F406387%2F115d51a3-9e1a-4bcf-b295-a8287d9a5596.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/mwpryGKB.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/mwpryGKB.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-08T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T23:44:48.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
