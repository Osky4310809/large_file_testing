She was struck twice at Kings Highway and Nostrand Avenue at around 6:45 a.m.,   Hermanda Booker (credit: Twitter/Hermanda Booker) \nThe 29-year-old’s sisters were inconsolable as they returned to their Midwood home Tuesday afternoon. Her father was stunned to have his daughter taken away so tragically. \n“She was one of the best children that any parent would want to have,” Herman Booker told CBS2’s Hazel Sanchez. \n“She’s a good teacher,” stepfather Philippe Antoine said. “She’s a nice kid for us. She respects everybody.” \nWitnesses say visibility was poor as Booker was on her way to work at Highland Park Community School. Police say she was walking off the crosswalk across Nostrand Avenue at Kings Highway when the driver of a mini-van struck her. Police say the driver of the school bus that subsequently hit Booker didn’t see her lying on the street. \nBooker was rushed to Beth Israel Hospital in cardiac arrest but succumbed to her injuries, police said. \nHerman says his daughter just started her first teaching job in September had big dreams. \n“She wanted to have her doctorate in education and this is the end result,” he said. “It’s tragic, really tragic.” \nEarlier Tuesday, police said Booker had been killed in a hit-and-run crash and said they were searching for a white SUV. However, after further investigation, they told CBS2 there was no hit-and-run as both vehicles remained on the scene. \nPeople in the neighborhood say the intersection where Booker was struck is a dangerous one and police have cameras in place to catch drivers running red lights. \nNo charges will be filed against either driver involved in today’s accident, according to authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:34:28.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
