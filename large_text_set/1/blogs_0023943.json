By Jason Samenow By Jason Samenow January 29 at 5:59 PM Follow @capitalweather \nFor students and teachers eagerly anticipating a snow day, it’s been a tough winter. The two instances of widespread accumulating snow and/or ice have occurred on Saturdays and few school systems have had even as much as a delay. \nThe snow expected to occur tonight is unlikely to amount to enough to cancel classes Monday. Where accumulating snow occurs, assuming it materializes, some delayed openings are a possibility. As we’ve highlighted in our forecast , the best chance of at least an inch of snow is south of the Beltway. So we think the counties most likely to delay are Stafford, Charles, and Calvert – but even there the chance is only around 40 percent. \nGenerally, the farther north you go, the less likely there are of any delays or school disruptions. \nWe are not issuing a FedCast, as we don’t think the Federal government will alter operations. Most of the snow should be finished by around 5 a.m. and the rush hour commute should be okay – even if some neighborhood roads south of town could have a bit of snow on them. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T01:07:28.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
