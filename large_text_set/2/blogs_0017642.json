Cashin, Assistant Director in the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department, and mission chief of India, told PTI . \n“It’s sucking in cash, withdrawing it from the economy, and then the vacuum cleaner is going in reverse, slowly replacing cash but as I said, at a fairly modest pace. That’s led to a lot of cash shortages that have adversely affected consumption,” Mr. Cashin said in response to a question as the IMF released its annual country-report on India.
