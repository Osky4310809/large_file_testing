People are upset with Wonder Woman ‘s armpits , and they’re making their voices heard.\nThe trailer for the new Wonder Woman movie was finally released , and it’s clear that Diana Prince (played by Gal Gadot) is going to kick some major ass. She’s fierce, brilliant, and an all-around badass , to say the least. But her badass-ery is not what the internet is talking about right now. It’s her hairless armpits. \nIn the trailer, we see Diana lifting a car (yes, a car) and throwing it down a street. We’re able to get a solid view of her armpits, which happen to be freshly shaven and seem to be digitally bleached. As you can imagine, people are pissed.\nBecause, according to fans, how does Wonder Woman have time to groom her armpits when she’s busy fighting the conflicts of the world? More specifically, why would an Amazon with no previous contact with the outside world care about hair under her armpits?\nHere are the pits in question:\nWarner Bros. Fans have taken to Twitter to discuss their concerns about her lack of armpit hair.\nJust doing some pod-related Twitter searching, and until this point I hadn't realised how badly I wanted Wonder Woman to have armpit hair.\n— Joe Cunningham (@JoeCunningham14) March 16, 2017 controversial hot take:\ni wish #WonderWoman had visible armpit hair.\n\nshe was raised on an island of women w/no schick advertisements!\n— Paul Roth in LA (@paulidin) March 12, 2017 Just speaking aesthetically, the new Wonder Woman trailer had me wishing she had armpit hair.\n— mattson tomlin (@mattsontomlin) March 12, 2017 While we understand where fans are coming from, here’s the thing: Wonder Woman can still be symbol of female empowerment even if she shaves her armpits. The two things are not mutually exclusive.\nPlus, in the history of Wonder Woman , she’s never had hair under her arms. And in other news...\nTY @galgadot @reallyndacarter & @susaneisenberg1 for being Sure #wonderwoman #girlpower #armpit & proud. @PattyJenks pic.twitter.com/jcyeLyYNF6 \n— Vaughn Mounsey (@WonderVaughn) March 18, 2017 First female superhero film for 17 years and all the talk is about her armpits... #WonderWoman pic.twitter.com/MPXMERdi3S \n— r.a.c.h.e.l t. (@racheltunnard) March 17, 2017 Sure, it’s probably unlikely that a superhero like Wonder Woman would have the time shave her pits. But she has to make time to shower at some point, right? There’s no way for her to have oil-free hair without a little rinse off. So while she was bathing, perhaps she decided to shave. It takes less than 30 seconds to shave both armpits, so we’re pretty sure she’d be able to make time for that.\nCheck out the trailer:\nNo armpit hair, don’t care. Also – armpit hair, don’t care. You do you.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:15:55.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
