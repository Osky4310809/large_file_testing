Photos \nMarc Malkin's Instagrams HBO \n\"The truth of the matter is there is no script. There's never been a script,\" SJP said. \"The idea remains a real possibility but when is the right time? I guess that's what it all boils down to—when! So we'll see.\" \nThe second SATC flick was released in 2010 two years after the first hit theaters. \nParker did apologize if her answers about a third movie have been more of a tease than anything else. \"I don't tease,\" she explained. \"I'm asked the question and keep trying to find new ways of answering because it's so boring or [not] to crush this idea\" of another film. \nSex and the City ran on HBO from 1998 until 2004. It took home seven Emmys from 50 nominations. It also won eight of its 24 Golden Globe noms. \nParker currently stars on HBO's Divorce .
