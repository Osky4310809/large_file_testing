Obama turned to British spies to get surveillance on Trump pic.twitter.com/IghCFm7qhO\n— FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 14, 2017\n\"There’s no question that there were surveillance techniques used,” Spicer said from the White House briefing room podium on Monday. \"He didn’t use the NSA, he didn’t use the CIA, he didn’t use the FBI, and he didn’t use the Department of Justice. He used GCHQ.\"\nSpicer was trying to back allegations made by President Trump on Twitter on Mar. 4, which claimed the Obama administration had spied on Trump during the campaign by wiretapping Trump tower.\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\nInstead, he started a diplomatic crisis with America's best ally.\nSpicer's allegations during the briefing prompted the GCHQ to release a statement — a very rare move for the British intelligence agency, which usually doesn't comment on intelligence matters.\n“Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct ‘wire tapping’ against the then president-elect are nonsense,\" a spokesperson said . “They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.”\nGCHQ's communications director Andrew Pike even replied on Twitter to Eric King, former deputy director of Privacy International, a UK-based rights group:\n@e3i5 Well it is a very unusual allegation\n— Andrew Pike (@andrewkpike) March 16, 2017\nSafe to say they were pretty pissed.\nThis morning, British newspaper The Telegraph and tabloid The Sun Quote: d unnamed intelligence sources as saying that the U.S. had officially apologised, even going as far as saying that the apology came direct from Spicer and National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster.\nDowning Street said in an official statement that the UK made it clear the allegations \"were ridiculous\" and got assurance \"that they would not be repeated.\"\nSpat is over, then, you might think. Let's get back to business as usual — special relationship and all of that.\nWrong.\nAccording to a statement released by the White House Friday and obtained by NBC News, Sean Spicer \"was simply pointing to public reports and not endorsing any specific story.\" Of course he was.\nJUST IN: White House says it has told the British gov't that it \"was simply pointing to public reports, not endorsing any specific story.\" pic.twitter.com/A8ZDBFTMRD\n— NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) March 17, 2017\nNo hint of apology to UK in NSC statement: @PressSec \"was simply pointing to public reports\" that British Intell wiretapped Trump Tower.\n— Mark Knoller (@markknoller) March 17, 2017\nWH: Mr. Spicer and General McMaster explained that Mr. Spicer was simply pointing to public reports, not endorsing any specific story.\n— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) March 17, 2017\nWH: Spicer and McMaster explained to UK officials that Spicer was \"simply pointing to public reports and not endorsing any specific story.\"\n— Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) March 17, 2017\nThe saga continues...\nWATCH: Behold, the Trump mask.", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/7DdgBENJ.m3u8", "https://t.co/A8ZDBFTMRD", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3113233/white-house-issues-grovelling-apology-to-downing-street-for-falsely-accusing-gchq-of-spying-on-donald-trump/", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/17/us-makes-formal-apology-britain-white-house-accuses-gchq-wiretapping/", "https://www.ft.com/content/ee7663bc-0a7d-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b", "https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/842765068840423424", "https://twitter.com/peterbakernyt/status/842753942035578880", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/13/trump-wiretapping-claim-quotation-marks-obama", "https://twitter.com/PressSec", "https://twitter.com/Judgenap", "https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/842758113849753601", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/7DdgBENJ.jpg", "https://t.co/IghCFm7qhO", "https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/842756217831415808", "https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjKm7-r9N3SAhWMB8AKHRTeDKkQFggiMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.skynews.com.au%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Finternational%2F2017%2F03%2F18%2Fus-spy-talk--ridiculous---may-spokesman.html&usg=AFQjCNFv2QtrEdFZsBXf-vT7GltTqAjhpw&sig2=GZ2P83oBA2SlreurSqvUlg&bvm=bv.149760088,d.ZGg", "https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/841619127999508480", "https://twitter.com/e3i5", "https://twitter.com/andrewkpike/status/842498118029598720"], "published": "2017-03-17T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T19:12:45.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
