Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 \n\"Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia [sic],\" Mr Trump tweeted. \nHis tweet appears to question whether the NSA and FBI are involved in the leaks. \nMr Trump previously attacked \"illegal leaks coming out of Washington\" after his national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign. Michael Flynn resigns as national security adviser over Russia row \nThe New York Times published the allegations that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies found \"repeated contacts\" between Mr Trump's campaign staff and associates and senior Russian intelligence operatives in the year leading up to the US election. \nThe communications were reportedly intercepted at the same time evidence of Russian involvement in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack was discovered, although officials said they found no evidence of the Trump team “colluding” with Russia on efforts to influence the result.
