In fact, both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that 2016's temperatures exceeded all previous years since instrument records began 137 years ago, and that human-caused global warming was responsible for a majority of the planetary fever.\nScientists are now warning that we should expect more such milestones in the years ahead, along with worsening climate impacts, as global warming progresses.\nSEE ALSO: Obama directs $500 million to Green Climate Fund just before Trump takes office\nSince the start of the 21st century, annual global temperature records have been broken five times — in 2005, 2010, 2014, 2015 and now last year.\n\"The string of records reflect the fact that we are going down a path that is dangerous and well-described,\" Sarah Myhre, an ocean and climate scientist at the University of Washington, told Mashable in an interview.\n\"It’s not a path that I would choose the international community to walk down and it’s not the path that I would choose for my son’s life in the future.\"\nTemperature deviation from the 1951-1980 average, including 2016.\nImage: bob al-greene/Mashable\n“It’s precisely the fact that we see series of records being broken” that shows the dominant role that human-caused global warming is playing in altering the climate, said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.\nAccording to NOAA, global land and ocean surface temperatures were 0.94 degrees Celsius, or 1.69 degrees Fahrenheit, above the 20th century average, which beat the 2015 record by 0.04 degrees Celsius, or 0.07 degrees Fahrenheit. The first eight months of the year were each record warm, NOAA found.\nUsing independent methods, NASA found that globally-averaged surface temperatures in 2016 were 0.99 degrees Celsius, or 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit, warmer than the mid-20th century average. (NASA and NOAA differ in their base period as well as their precise methodology, which accounts for the differences in temperature findings.)\nTaken separately, NOAA found that global land temperatures were the warmest on record last year, while ocean surface temperatures also set a record for the highest temperatures ever observed.\nNot a single land area on the planet was cooler than average last year, NOAA found.\nInstead, record high temperatures were noted across Far East Russia, Alaska, Far Western Canada, parts of the eastern U.S., much of Central America and northern South America, parts of Australia, as well as portions of Siberia and south Asia.\nGlobal warming context While the annual record is noteworthy, it's the long-term temperature trend that has climate scientists and world leaders worried.\nAccording to NASA, the planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 1.1 degrees Celsius, or 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit, since the late 19th century, a change scientists blame on increased carbon dioxide and other human-released emissions into the atmosphere.\nGlobal warming has accelerated in recent decades, with 16 of the 17 warmest years in NASA's records.\nThe presence of a strong El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean at the beginning of 2016 also boosted temperatures, according to scientists, though it was not sufficient by itself to set an annual temperature record.\nTemperature deviation from average by decade ending in 2016.\nImage: bob al-greene/mashable\nBy releasing more heat from the ocean into the atmosphere and altering weather patterns, El Niño events tend to boost global average temperatures.\nMyhre, of the University of Washington, said records like this one are expected due to the buildup in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere due to human activities.\nAs a person, as a citizen, as someone who is raising a kid, these milestones are heartbreaking and terrifying\nShe said the continuing progression of global warming is worrisome, even though it is well-understood from a scientific standpoint.\n“As a scientist I would look at these continued record-breaking years and think 'yup, this makes sense, this is what I would assume would be happening based on my understanding,'\" Myhre said.\n“As a person, as a citizen, as someone who is raising a kid, these milestones are heartbreaking and terrifying, and I would say that what is it going to take? How many more milestones is it going to take?” she said in an interview.\n“We all have to be a bit more emotionally honest about these kinds of milestones.”\nArctic differences While the two agencies both concluded that 2016 ranks first on the list of warmest years, there are important differences between NOAA and NASA's methods that account for the disparity between the magnitude of temperature anomalies that scientists calculated.\nTemperature anomaly map for the Arctic in the fall of 2016.\nImage: noaa\nThe NOAA data does not include much Arctic climate data since instruments are sparse in that vast region.\nNASA, though, uses data interpolation techniques to account for Arctic temperatures. Since this was the warmest year on record in the Arctic, it's little surprise that NASA's average global temperature anomaly for 2016 is far higher than NOAA's.\nThe Arctic climate in 2016 was “almost off the scale\" in its unusually high temperatures, according to NASA's Schmidt. In keeping with this observation, Arctic sea ice hit all-time lows in 2016, and has entered 2017 in a weakened state that could result in a record summer melt season.\nJessica Blunden, a scientist with ERT Inc. who helps maintain NOAA's climate database, said the agency's records may not have captured all of the \"incredible warmth\" seen in the Arctic this year.\nSeparately, the World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency, combined information from NOAA, NASA and two UK-based research institutions to also establish 2016 as the warmest year on record, with a temperature anomaly of about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial era.\nThat anomaly is perilously close to the temperature target contained in the Paris Climate Agreement. In that pact, which went into effect in Nov. 2016, world leaders committed to keeping global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels, and also aimed for a more ambitious, though aspirational, 1.5-degree celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, target.\nWith 2016 already bumping up against the 1.5-degree mark, it’s clear that this target may be difficult, if not impossible, to adhere to.\n2017 may not set another record A press release from NASA accompanying Wednesday's announcement said researchers have found that the waning El Niño in 2016 increased the annual global temperature anomaly for 2016 by 0.12 degrees Celsius, or just 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit.\nPerhaps to head off claims that most of the warming in 2016 was due to El Niño, Blunden said that compared to 1998, the last year with an extremely strong El Niño event, 2016 was more than a half-a-degree Fahrenheit warmer, owing largely to the additional influence of long-term warming. In the absence of global warming, one would expect 1998 and 2016 to be nearly equal in their temperature deviation from average, Blunden said.\nThe fact that El Niño has waned heading into 2017 means that it's less likely this year will set an annual temperature record, despite the continued presence of human-caused global warming.\n\"Short-term climate change includes the up-and-down of El Niño/La Niña, the up-and-down of the sun getting slightly brighter or dimmer and of explosive volcanos not blocking the sun with particles or else blocking it, and the up-and-up of the warming from rising carbon dioxide [concentrations],\" said Richard Alley, a climate researcher at Penn State University, in an email.\n\"There is high likelihood that we will have years without new records in the near future; that does NOT mean that global warming stopped,\" Alley said.\nBlunden told Mashable that even if the globe falls short of setting another temperature record in 2017, some parts of the world still will, such as the Arctic. And more global records will be around the corner, too.\n“That just means that the impacts are starting to happen faster and faster. We are seeing the impacts of climate change now whether we’re hitting the records or not,” she said.\nThe 2016 record temperature news comes less than two days before President-elect Donald Trump enters the White House, having vowed to gut programs aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing global warming.\nBONUS: Biggest die-off of corals ever recorded on Great Barrier Reef", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ik5u4p3KWEmBstPoLYBFTFPJoUs=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351832%2F6d182a34-c3de-41e9-bee8-214a53e626b0.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZUUDl7TEUMEtiewkXucWzUvSN_A=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351835%2Fffe0e980-d355-440c-8741-cdacd40b14ed.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/4vUCYxw1.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p77CsBpSirWSakOhwQ_8PsdGBG4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351835%2Fffe0e980-d355-440c-8741-cdacd40b14ed.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KrCtz_Kni7FV2LXQMrIWHry0F0Y=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351832%2F6d182a34-c3de-41e9-bee8-214a53e626b0.png", "http://giphy.com/embed/EJuGVVWjpuuGs?html5=true", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/v5lqVZ7FWVIrCL07685IVpk8unY=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351830%2F6ddb381e-0a88-405b-87d0-a5217ca3c0bf.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/4vUCYxw1.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TbSR4qnDFWvy8CZ04jVoOz9MwS8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F351830%2F6ddb381e-0a88-405b-87d0-a5217ca3c0bf.png"], "published": "2017-01-18T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T17:40:35.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
