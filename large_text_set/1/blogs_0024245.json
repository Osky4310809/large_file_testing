But even with acknowledging that, we’re still totally blown away by the fact that Winter posted a throwback pic of her younger self from a movie we had NO clue she was in.\nThe movie in question is Kiss Kiss Bang Bang — and to be totally fair, we kind of forgot the film existed. If you’re in need of a refresher ( ahem , like we were), the 2005 comedy-crime movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, and Michelle Monaghan. It was written and directed by Shane Black — the man behind Lethal Weapon , Iron Man 3 , and The Nice Guys .\nIn the film, Winter plays a younger version of Monaghan’s character Harmony Faith Lane. And based on the Instagram photo Winter shared, you may just be wondering what the hell is going on.\nIs she safe?! Don’t harm baby Ariel! #tbt to little me in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang \nA photo posted by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) on Jan 26, 2017 at 6:03pm PST \nWell, thanks to the glory of YouTube, her scene from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is available for you to watch to help give some perspective. Turns out that her character was in a magic act for this scene. At the end of the clip, she adorably pronounces, “I’m going to be an actress” before not-so adorably getting hit.\nWinter, who turns 19 on January 28th , is barely recognizable in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang . That makes sense since she was around 6 years old when the film was made. But still. We’ve been on a first name basis with Winter since she started the role of Alex Dunphy on Modern Family in 2009, so we’re a bit ashamed of ourselves.\nHowever, we’re gonna cut ourselves some slack and say we can still call ourselves fans of Winter even if we didn’t know she was in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang . And honestly, we can’t wait to see the next throwback pic she shares of her child acting days.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T01:21:34.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
