I’ve seen so many of the Marvel franchises, particularly being the mother of four. They tend to be the only type of film particularly having young boys. But for me as an actor, this is separate is my desire to work with [director] Taika Waititi,” Cate told EW .\n“Can you believe it? Can you believe we’re having this conversation and it’s 2017 and we’re talking about the first female villain? It’s ridiculous. There’s so much untapped potential villainy in women. It’s really exciting. I think finally it’s beginning to be acknowledged that women and men want to see a diverse array of characters, and that’s race, gender across the sexual spectrum,” Cate continued. \nAlso pictured inside: Cate checking out of her hotel on Monday (March 20) in New York City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T19:17:02.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
