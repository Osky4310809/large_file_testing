Linebacker Trent Murphy tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and is facing a four-game suspension, the Washington Post reported Sunday. \nAccording to the report, Murphy is appealing the suspension. The 26-year-old linebacker, who has increased his sack totals each of his first three years in the league, had a breakout season in 2016, finishing second on the Redskins with nine sacks. \nPrior to last season, Murphy had somewhat underachieved. The former second-round pick out of Stanford had six sacks in 31 games before 2016, when he combined with Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith to form an imposing pass-rushing trio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T04:38:39.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
