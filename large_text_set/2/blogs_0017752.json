Renault have revealed their new RS17 car as they target a much-improved 2017 Formula 1 season. \nAfter Williams and Sauber revealed images of their respective new challengers, Renault have become the first team to physically unveil their 2017 contender at a glittering launch event in central London. \nRetaining the distinctive yellow livery which returned to F1 last year, the French manufacturer-owned team are aiming to move up the grid. \nAfter finishing ninth last year, Renault Sport president Jerome Stoll has set the target of a fifth-placed finish in 2017. \n\"The R.S.17 is the first car which Enstone and Viry [Renault's UK and French F1 bases] have been able to plan and develop from the outset and we're satisfied by the fruits of this interaction,\" he said. \"It's a beautiful car. \n\"As well as the excitement of the R.S.17 itself, we also have a highly important new partner in BP through their BP and Castrol brands. For 2017 our performance targets are clear. We want to take a definite, tangible step forward in performance and results. Fifth position in the Constructors' Championship is our goal.\" \nNico Hulkenberg has joined the team from Force India, with Britain's Jolyon Palmer retained for a second campaign. \nRenault's first year back at the helm of the Enstone team in 2016 proved disappointing with the team hamstrung by delays in the RS16's development.
