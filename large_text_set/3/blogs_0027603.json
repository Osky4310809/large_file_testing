After breaking the internet earlier this year by giving away 10,000 bottles of otherwise-commercially-unavailable Big Mac Sauce, McDonald’s has announced the coveted burger condiment will finally be available for retail sale — but only in Canada. Big Mac Sauce, not to mention bottled versions of the sauces that top Filet-O-Fish and McChicken sandwiches, will hit grocery store shelves later this spring. No word on if or when the bottles will cross the border anytime soon; in the meantime, expect Canadians to make some extra bucks hawking the stuff to Americans on eBay . • Chicago chef/ interesting human Rick Bayless can soon be found in your freezer case . Frontera Foods — Bayless’s line of packaged chips and salsas — is branching out into frozen skillet meals and bowls, available in grocery stores this summer. Bayless sold the Frontera packaged business to Conagra last September for a reported $108.9 million, but stayed on with the company as an “advisor.” • Christina Tosi’s sweets emporium Milk Bar is the latest brand to partner with an airline . JetBlue’s “premium” travel class, cutesily named Mint, will now offer Milk Bar snacks in its cabin, including branded juice, Tosi’s famous “bagel bombs,” and according to Fortune , a “pre-arrival Milk Bar cookie in a custom gift box.” • Shake Shack now delivers, sort of: The line-inducing burger chain is testing delivery in New York City via third-party service Caviar. It’s calling the weekend-only service a “delivery pop-up.” • Here’s the first look at hotly anticipated spring opening Double R Diner — aka, of course, the fictional greasy spoon setting of Twin Peaks . • Even Disney World is getting in on the mobile food-ordering game, allowing visitors to pre-order and pre-pay, via app, at a new Avatar -themed restaurant.
