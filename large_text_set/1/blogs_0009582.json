Nigel Howard \nLondoners battled to work this morning with almost no Tube service due to strike action over job losses and ticket office closures. \nIn the early hours of the morning almost all lines were suspended with the exception of the Bakerloo Line which was running a special service between Queens Park and Harrow & Wealdstone. \nThe Tube strike comes a day before further strike action is due on Southern Rail services, spelling travel misery for hundreds of thousands of people this week. \nCommuters desperate to travel to work have been Tweeting TfL services trying to establish which stations are open. Tube Strike looks to go ahead after RMT ends talks at averting strike \nThe Central Line Twitter account posted: ‚ÄúThe line will be running but some stations will be closed, I won't know which ones until staff do or don't turn up for work.‚Äù The first overpacked bus has just cruised past the station. This is going to take a while. #TubeStrike ‚Äî Imi Groome (@ImsyDot) January 9, 2017 Trains pass through the stn and all the buses I've seen are jam-packed. Looks like I'm walking the 4 miles to work üò© #TubeStrike ‚Äî Stew C (@stewnotstu) January 9, 2017 \nIt is expected that stations will begin to open at 7am but TfL previously announced that Zone 1 stations within the Circle Line boundary will remain closed all day. \nLondon's DLR has no service between Shadwell and Bank due to Bank station being closed but the Overground is running as normal. What you need to know about getting to work during the Tube strike \nEarly risers are already feeling the impact of the walk-out which is set to cripple the entire city‚Äôs transport system. \nAdam Tate tweeted at 6:30am: ‚ÄúStarted my journey 15 mins ago still not expected to get in until 8:40am; oh no the first day too.‚Äù \nRine Popat wrote: ‚ÄúThanks to the #TubeStrike I've been up at god knows hour to drop my siblings to work before I start work.‚Äù Strike action: Commuters try to board buses during a previous walkout (Getty Images) \nAnother frustrated commuter, Imi Groome, added: ‚ÄúThe first overpacked bus has just cruised past the station.
