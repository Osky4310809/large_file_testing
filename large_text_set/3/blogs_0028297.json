The chain announced that it's replacing the calorie-packed beverage with its new Frozen Coffee, a blended drink that combines coffee extract, sugar, and dairy. At a recent media event held at Dunkin' Brands' headquarters, company executives explained how the Coffee Coolatta is more of a dessert, as it's packed with sugar and calories, whereas the Frozen Coffee will hopefully appeal to guests looking for \"a more authentic, energizing coffee drinking experience,\" according to Business Insider .\nCoolatta fans who have been sipping on the menu staple since its inception in 1994 aren't taking the news too well, and many of them have shared their dismays on social media (some of which are slightly more dramatic than others).\nOmg @DunkinDonuts why would you ever discontinue the coffee coolatta?!
