In Mumbai? \nI am facing a wall of birds, butterflies, flowers, and jungle creatures from which I immediately recognise the tiger embroidered on the back of my own Gucci coat.

That included embroidery worked into three-dimensional pieces from re-cycled tins, foam mattresses, and even DVDs cut in to fine strips. The rubber, silicone, and industrial materials re-appear as high fashion in the collections of Maison Margiela or Gucci’s “Go Green” collections (which are part of its parent company Kering’s Science Based Targets Initiative to reduce its greenhouse emissions). \nA photo posted by Suzy Menkes (@suzymenkesvogue) on Feb 6, 2017 at 4:47am PST \n“We have always been passionate about ‘Go Green’, so we used different recycled materials – for example, Coke cans that we flattened and cut up – and Moschino produced a huge collection all with recycled materials,” Monica says. “Margiela does it with passion – they make sure they have it season after season. They hound us!” \nSince the two women have their own brand, Jade – using the family’s people skills to create fashionable clothes and serve the vast Indian wedding market – they understand the demands of international high fashion and have built relationships with leading designers – going back more than two decades in the case of Maria Grazia Chiuri, now the Artistic Director of Christian Dior.

A photo posted by Suzy Menkes (@suzymenkesvogue) on Feb 6, 2017 at 4:48am PST \n“They are so special because they are such a good image of India – they love the handwork and they care about recycling. They work hard to study, to understand European culture,” Maria Grazia continued, adding that the family’s Jain religion was another source of interest to her. “I’m sure you have sat in the studios where the men are and they don’t look like they are overworked – they look quite happy.” \nI had indeed visited the handwork “factory” where the embroiderers are all male, which is the tradition in India. Although I promised not to reveal anything about the new collections, I watched the embroiderers, who sit at floor benches, working on pieces for Gucci’s Alessandro Michele and other mostly Italian designers such as Alberta Ferretti.

I feel it must be an innate part of their rich culture.” \nThe family-owned Indian company has built more than a relationship with Italian designers. It has an office and showroom in Bologna, which includes some displays of heritage garments to give a visual understanding of the subcontinent’s rich and rare history in lavishly embellished clothing. There is also a display area in New York, where Ralph Lauren and Tory Burch have shown interest.

Europe once had an exceptional embroidery tradition, as evidenced by Opus Anglicanum – the extraordinary mediaeval embroidery exhibition held recently at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, as well as many other historical embroidery displays across the world. A photo posted by Suzy Menkes (@suzymenkesvogue) on Feb 6, 2017 at 4:54am PST \n\nThe Chanakya family is thinking about how to support embroidery in India, and will found a school either in Bengal – where most of their embroiderers come from – or in the village of Kutch in their ancestral home of Gujarat, in western India, where craftsmen have not received much exposure to international design. \n“So far, embroiderers are all men,” Karishma says, “but women are now ready to start, not only from their homes, but also officially. I am excited to do something where kids can get an education, but we also get embroidery. Sadly, we have a lot of grandfathers and fathers, but their sons are moving on to computers and technology. The artisanry is getting lost. So we are determined to do something by 2018.” \n“You will not believe how fashion-forward the village women are – their patterns, colours, and designs you could use today,” Karishma reveals. “And they won’t think twice before telling you if things work – saying a colour is not a good idea and sticking to aubergine and orange! If you gain their respect and they see you are there for them, they are incredibly open and happy to learn new techniques.” \nAnd just in case Chanakya is short of new recruits, Karishma’s 10-year-old daughter is already on-message. She comes each Saturday and helps teach the children of the embroiderers to make their own handwork – the ultimate example of Indian family companies keeping the flag flying.
