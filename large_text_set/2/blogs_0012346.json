Not even Eden Hazard can always carry the team to victory. \nThe challenge consisted of a football version of Top Golf (or skee-ball, if you will), with players required to chip the ball into increasingly smaller buckets. The smaller the bucket, the more points your shot would be worth — the closest and largest was worth 1200 points while the farthest and smallest was worth 2000 points. Each player had three shots. \nEden Hazard hit two of three into the middle bucket for 3200 total points, but his teammates only managed one each, with Batshuayi only getting the easiest one just the once. Maybe that passing rating was spot on after all, wasn't it? \nMeanwhile, Team Rest of the World had much more consistent points-scoring, with N'Golo Kanté hitting twice and both Zouma and Chalobah hitting the most valuable target once. And so, the upset win to the non-Belgians, much to the delight of Chalobah. \nAnd of course David Luiz was around, too. If there's fun to be had, David Luiz will be there.
