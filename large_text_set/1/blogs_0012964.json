All Tesla cars with the HW2 kit, including Model S and Model X vehicles, are now receiving the over-the-air software update that includes the updated Autopilot features, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk notes that it’ll be present only in “non-actuating” mode for the time being, with activation of the software coming as early as the end of this week. HW2 Autopilot now downloading to all HW2 cars, but in non-actuating mode to assess reliability. If looks good, actuation by end of week. \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2017 \nThe update for HW2 models has been in testing with a small subset of cars since New Year’s Eve, with a group of 1,000 vehicles receiving the update early for verification purposes ahead of a rollout to the entire fleet. Last week, Musk also said that a new HW2 update revision was being pushed out to those testers, as well as the broader population in shadow mode, meaning the Tesla team has probably quashed a few bugs between its initial deployment and now. \nFeatures including auto-steer and intelligent speed maintenance have not been available to Tesla owners with HW2 sensors and computing hardware, because Tesla redesigned its approach to the semi-autonomous driving features to suit the new capabilities. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:22:32.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
