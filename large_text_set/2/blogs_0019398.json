Footage posted online purportedly shows the moment police shot the driver (Photo: Twitter / @APetchoice) The car had ploughed into a crowd of pedestrians (Photo: Twitter / @APetchoice) \nFootage posted on Twitter showed the moment the knife-wielding suspect was shot by police. \nPolice said the suspect was seriously injured in the shooting and was in hospital. \nTerrorism was not suspected and the man is thought to have acted alone, said police. \nLocal media reports suggested the man was suffering from mental health issues. Forensic officers investigate at the scene (Photo: Twitter @raphael_rauch) The area has been cordoned off by police (Photo: Twitter / @ PoliceMannheim) \nThe incident occurred in a pedestrian area in Bismarckplatz in the picturesque city in south-western Germany. \nHours later forensics teams in white outfits were seen examining the black three-door car after it was cordoned off. \nIn December an attacker deliberately drove a lorry into the Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and injuring more than 50. \nThat attack was claimed by the terror group ISIS.
