In fact most of what is worthwhile in financial guidance stands the test of time and isn’t complex. As with today’s markets new highs are being printed every day it seems. It is at these times we should be reviewing our plans to see what options are available to improve our odds of success.) \nIn August 2015, when world markets started to wobble and volatility picked up, people started getting pretty nervous. It’s worth noting that the S&P 500 had dropped around 12.5% from its highs earlier that year, but that would generally qualify as a “correction,” a phenomenon that once happened with some regularity. Investors hadn’t seen one since 2011. Since then the markets trended higher with nary a setback for four years. It was all ice cream and back rubs. Life was great in 2015. \nNow look back to August 2015. At the time of the drop I was talking with an old friend. He asked me point blank “Is the market gonna crash?” “Definitely,” I answered. “Like now?” he asked with growing interest. “Oh I have no idea when it will crash, but invariably it always does.” \nThe task at hand is to be prepared now. Expect Market Fluctuations \nWhich brings me to an important point I want to address today. If you are investing in the markets you have to acknowledge and expect that markets drops, corrections and crashes are part and parcel of the process. Without them we couldn’t make any money. But we will never know ahead of time when this will happen. Everyone seems to know this on some level but few really respect it until it starts to hurt. Until then it’s a whole lot of lip service. But when it does happen, more often than not, people react to events and make bad decisions. And I am sympathetic to that. It’s not easy to follow a plan when things are going against you but that is precisely when the plan is the most valuable. (For more from this author, see: Thoughts for Those Investing Over the Next 10 Years .) \nNow that the markets have returned to levels of last year (although we had an intervening somewhat sharper drop to begin 2016) you need to view today as an opportunity. Please. It’s an opportunity to review your overall situation and create an actual written plan for your goals. Then, and only then, assess what investment mix is needed to get you where you need to go. My experience is that investors frequently take a lot more risk than necessary to reach their goals. In doing so they may end up with less than they hoped for and had a more volatile ride. (For related reading from this author, see: Can You Control Your Financial Well-Being? ) Make Changes While Market Is Stable \nWhy now? Because fundamentally everyone saving for retirement and other goals needs a quantified plan to have a chance to get where they need to go. But more importantly, now that the markets have stabilized you have the best opportunity to make changes if they are needed, which they may well be. When discussing the need for planning with clients in the past, far too many acknowledged that they probably had the wrong portfolio and too much risk but said they would address it if things went against them. Seriously, this is what many people told me. This is like trying to buy homeowners insurance when your house is already on fire. You must act before things go against you, it’s the time you have the best opportunity. Making important decisions under stress rarely yields good outcomes. \nWaiting for things to go wrong before you do what you should just works against your own long-term interest. And is unnecessarily painful. Take the opportunity to act now. Or it may just disappear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T06:56:27.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
