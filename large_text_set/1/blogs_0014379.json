Hope this helps someone ;) works, but needs improvment by ATL Leerssens I’ve been using CoRD for years and now that it has more or less dropped out of support and crashes frequently on El Capitan, I moved on to this app after finding it in the App Store. A few things annoy me right out of the gate, and documentation is sparse so I’m not sure if there is a way to reslove them:- With CoRD, Commnd-K integrated so that I could quickly connect to a remote server without having to do a bunch of configuation.- This version of Remote Desktop forces a new connection into Spaces, which seems to be configurable but the option to turn it off is grayed out.Other than that, cut/paste work as expected, which is huge when working with multiple OSes on different windows. Hopefully this app will get some love and improve over time. Works great by SMXSteve I’ve use the Windows version for years and have been using this on my Macbook for four years now. I love it! I can always access my servers and Windows PCs. In fact, I have one Window 7 PC which I use strictly for development. I just remote into it from my Macbook and it works flawlessly!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T03:00:13.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
