Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta, scored 67 votes to defeat his opponent, Mr Justine Okubo. \nOkubo did not score any vote in the election which started on Thursday and was concluded on Friday morning amidst tight security. \nThe election was held despite the crisis rocking the council which fragmented the organization. \nOther officers elected with Omare included Mr Ebalakpo Parkins (Secretary general), Magada Franklin (financial secretary) and Henry Ayala (spokesman). \nAddressing the delegates who attended the convention, Omare pledged to reconcile all aggrieved persons as well as promote peace among the Ijaw ethnic nationality. \nThe outgoing President, Udengs Eradiri, commended the Ijaw nation and the IYC for giving him the opportunity to serve them. \n“I pray the new IYC executive will carry on with the vision and mission of the IYC. \n“Eric Omare is a man that is grounded in the Ijaw struggle and I believe he won’t fail in this regard. \n“I will always be available to give advice and assist when the body needs it,” Eradiri promised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:17:50.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
