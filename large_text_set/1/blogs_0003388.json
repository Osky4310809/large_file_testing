In it, we here Wiz rap about being with some gangsters (referring to his TGOD crew), but not before he opens up with some bars, rapping..“I got different flavors, different strokes for different folks/ Talkin ‘bout paper, Im getting the most.” \nUnfortunately, Chevy didn’t give us much information as for the record itself or where it will live on, but that’s what helps build anticipation.
