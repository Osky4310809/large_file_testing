Anti-halal campaigner sued over claims Islamic certification supports terrorism Read more \nOne user posted “Love to come. But I live in Qld... good luck”, while another said “150 per head, bugger that!” and another posted “Sorry I am busy - I have to stay home and cut my toe nails!” \nSydney will host a similar dinner on 9 February , without Christensen or Bernardi. Its speakers will include Sky News host Ross Cameron, controversial cartoonist Larry Pickering, Angry Anderson, and crime author Gabrielle Lord. \nThe dinners will be hosted by the Q Society , which calls itself “Australia’s leading Islam-critical movement”, and has called for a 10-year moratorium on immigration from Organisation of Islamic Cooperation countries, and for Australia to withdraw from the “hijacked” UN refugee convention. \nLast year Mohamed El-Mouelhy, the head of Halal Certification Australia, launched legal action against the organisation and three of its members over two videos posted on YouTube in 2013 and 2014. \nThe defendants include Kirralie Smith, a New South Wales Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance who narrated the videos, and Debbie Robinson, national president of the Q Society. \nAccording to a statement of claim filed in the action, the videos posted by the defendants made several defamatory imputations about El-Mouelhy, including that he sought to mislead and deceive the general public, was pushing for sharia law in Australia, and was promoting “a global push for Islamisation calculated to destroy Australia values of freedom and tolerance”. \nEl-Mouelhy is seeking damages, aggravated damages, interest and injunctions against further publication of the imputations. Smith says YouTube has blocked both videos from Australian IP addresses. \n“So unless you have a different IP address you are not able to judge for yourself the content of these publications,” she said . \nLast month Christensen told Guardian Australia he had been asked to appear at the fundraising dinner in Melbourne “to assist my good friend Kirralie”. \n“I will be speaking in support of free speech and against political correctness.” George Christensen on poverty, priesthood and a flirtation with One Nation Read more \nBernardi, who has made accusations against El-Mouelhy under parliamentary privilege, told the Australian last month he was “more than happy to ­assist in raising money to fund the legal defence of a friend against Mohamed El-Mouelhy”. \nSmith says all proceeds and donations will go towards the legal expenses incurred by Q Society of Australia Inc, Smith et al in the defamation action. \nA trial has been set down for four to five weeks in the NSW supreme court in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T09:17:18.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
