updates: Chelsea plot big bid for Celtic star FOX SPORTS January 31, 2017 12:06pm \nCHELSEA are set to be busy trying to secure some big deals at the last minute as the January transfer window nears its end. \nPlus all the latest transfer rumours and news. \nIt’s Deadline Day Rumour Mill … \nCHELSEA PLOTTING LAST MINUTE SPLURGE \nChelsea are weighing up whether they should splurge on transfer deadline day as a number of moves hang in the balance. \nThe Guardian reports Antonio Conte is interested in making a formal bid of £30m ($50m) for Celtic star Moussa Dembele , who has scored 20 goals in 38 appearances since moving from Fulham. \nBut the Telegraph claims a bid closer to £40m is what is required to secure the striker, while Conte also hopes to sign Celtic’s goalkeeper Craig Gordon. \nThat Gordon deal is the key to Asmir Begovic’s future. He has been linked with a move to Bournemouth but won’t be allowed to leave unless a replacement comes in ( the Mirror ). \nDefender Sead Kolasinac could also join the runaway EPL leaders, as Branislav Ivanovic looks increasingly likely to leave for Zenit St Petersburg. \nIvanovic has agreed a two and a half year deal with Zenit on a free transfer and will fly out to Russia to complete the deal. Meanwhile with Kolasinac’s contract running out at Schalke, the German club are willing to sanction a deal before the transfer deadline. \nSOUTHAMPTON SET FOR BUSY DEADLINE DAY \nSouthampton are set to be busy on deadline day, having agreed a deal with Napoli for striker Manolo Gabbiadini according to Sky Italia . \nIn a deal which could reach £17million, the deal for the 25-year-old could spell the end of Jay Rodriguez’s time at the club. \nThe Express reports Rodriguez has attracted interest from West Brom, West Ham, Sunderland and Bournemouth and could move before the window slams shut, having been limited to just six starts this season. \nSouthampton are also in “advanced talks” to bring in Serdar Tasci from Spartak Moscow, whose contract expires at the end of the season. \nODDS SLASHED FOR COLEMAN DEAL \nThe Manchester Evening News reports Manchester United could be set to make a deadline day raid for Everton’s Seamus Coleman. \nBookmaker odds have been slashed as Jose Mourinho steps up interest in the 28-year-old, who had been linked with a move to Old Trafford under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal. \nBookies are now offering 1/3 odds that the deal will go through, although United have denied they will be involved in any transfer action, aside from Ashley Young sealing a move elsewhere. \nYoung has been linked with a move to China, while Swansea, Everton, Watford and West Brom have all showed interest in the winger. \nKLOPP EYES GOALKEEPER \nLiverpool have been linked with Real Betis and former Real Madrid goalkeeper Antonio Adan with Jurgen Klopp interested in his low buyout clause. \nThe 29-year-old is available for just £6.8million according to Marca in a link which has subsequently been reported in the Liverpool Echo . \nHowever the Reds could face competition from French side Marseille, who are also said to be sniffing around. \nCHINA OFFERS ROLL IN LATE \nWatford’s Odion Ighalo and West Brom’s Solomon Rondon have been at the centre of two big deadline day offers from Chinese Super League clubs. \nWest Brom have rejected a staggering £32m offer from Tianjin Quanjian for Rondon, with the CSL club already snapping up former AC Milan striker Alexander Pato for £15.5m earlier in the window. \nThe Daily Mail reports that boss Tony Pulis is in no rush to sell his star striker, but is interested \nin Watford striker Ighalo. He will have to match a £20m offer made by Chongchun Yatai. \nWatford have accepted that bid for Ighalo who, according to the Mirror , is weighing up his options before agreeing to move to China. \nWatford are also planning to move for Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul, making a bid to sign him temporarily until the end of the season. \nPALACE PLANNING ANOTHER DEAL \nCrystal Palace are looking to shore up their defence and sign former Juventus defender Martin Caceres on a free transfer. \nThe Uruguayan has been uncontracted since leaving the Italian giants at the end of last season and ESPN reports Caceres is set to train with Palace as they weigh up offering him a deal. \nEVERTON LOOKING TO BRING ONE IN \nRonald Koeman is interested in signing Burnley defender Michael Keane as time runs out in the transfer window. \nEverton have already acted late to let Bryan Oviedo and Darren Gibson leave and Koeman is set to make a “last gasp” attempt to snatch Keane, says the Mirror.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:25:40.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
