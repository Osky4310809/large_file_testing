Foreign agents must submit receipts and disbursements in relation to the work they perform for foreign entities.\nManatos filed paperwork on May 11, 2016 to work on behalf of the VTB Group, a \"global provider of financial services, comprised of over 20 financial institutions and financial companies operating across all key areas of the financial markets,\" the registration reads.\nThe Russian government is the majority shareholder of the VTB Group, controlling 60.9 percent of voting shares. The group received a $2.6 billion bailout from the Russian government in 2014-15, the registration notes.\nManatos was tapped by the group to lobby Congress and the Obama administration on sanctions imposed on Russian-affiliated banks.\nAccording to a \"privileged and confidential\" document attached to the registration, the firm receives $17,500 per month and a $35,000 security retainer fee for its services.\nManatos bundled more than $40,000 in lobbyist contributions for Clinton's campaign. He and brother Andy Manatos, the second partner at the firm, have donated tens of thousands to Democratic politicians, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.\nTony Podesta, owner of the powerful D.C.-based Podesta Group lobbying shop, works on behalf of Sberbank CIB USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Russia's largest bank that is majority-owned by the government. Tony is the brother of John Podesta, the former chairman of Clinton's campaign.\nA lobbying report filed with Congress showed that Sberbank paid Podesta $20,000 in the first quarter of 2016 to \"clarify the scope of sanctions imposed by Executive Order 13660,\" signed by President Obama in March 2014 to block \"property of certain persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine.\" Podesta also was hired to explore possible sanctions relief.\nThe Security Services of Ukraine accused Sberbank of transferring funds to pro-Russia \"terrorists\" fighting for Soviet occupation in April 2014, a charge the bank denied .\nPodesta was paid $170,000 by Sberbank for his services throughout 2016, disclosure forms show . Podesta bundled at least $260,000 for Clinton's campaign and has given hundreds of thousands more to prominent Democratic lawmakers, PACs, and committees.\nCapitol Counsel, another D.C.-based lobbying firm, submitted a proposal to the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a $10 billion fund established by the Russian government, on Sep. 12, 2014 to represent the group in the United States. The letter was addressed to Kirill Dmitriev, the investment fund's chief executive officer.\n\"RDIF acts as co-investor or partner, always as a minority stakeholder, with leading international businesses and sovereign wealth funds. Co-investors perform joint due diligence with RDIF in evaluating opportunities and make independent investment decisions,\" the proposal states. \"Recent press articles have significantly misstated the role and function of RDIF. To help address this concern, Capitol Counsel proposes to assist RDIF in correcting the press reports by working with US investors and the international investment community to educate the Administration and major policy makers as to the role of RDIF and its relationship with US business and investors.\"\nCapitol Counsel proposed a monthly retainer of $45,000 for a minimum of two months as compensation.\nThe lobbying group submitted paperwork to FARA on October 31, 2014 to represent the Russian Direct Investment Fund. The group would \"educate and explain to U.S. Department of Treasury and U.S. policy-makers RDIF's role and relationship with the United States partners and investors\" and have communication with Treasury officials, policy-makers on Capitol Hill, and with Senate and House Committees of jurisdiction to \"gather information regarding U.S. sanctions on Russian entities.\"\nDavid Jones and Richard Sullivan, partners at Capitol Counsel, bundled more than $1.3 million for Clinton's campaign. The partners have donated generously to liberal politicians and groups.\nNone of the lobbyists in this story returned requests for comment by press time.\nThe post Top Democratic Lobbyist Bundlers Tied to Russian Interests appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T11:02:26.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
