I like to do that for fun, but I'm not really that kind of guitar player. Where I can be creative is in metal, that genre, that's my bread and butter, as you would say. Since I'm Chinese, my rice and noodles. [Laughs] But I really do like other guitar music.\" \nThe musician was also asked on how he developed his skills, saying: \"It's definitely practice, practice, practice, unfortunately. \n\"There's no magic formula to getting your fingers up to speed. I'm always trying to find a way to be better at what I'm doing. Be tighter, but more exciting, make it more fun. There's not a limit to do it. \n\"Sometimes I think, 'I did that solo live while jumping up and down continuously for 60 seconds. How cool is that?' The solo didn't actually get any better, but it was more fun while doing it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T06:39:46.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
