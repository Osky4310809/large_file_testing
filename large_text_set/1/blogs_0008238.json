Maryland law limits individual donations to $6,000. \nBrown also worked for Pugh as a legislative aide when she was a member of Maryland’s General Assembly. \nMayor Pugh commented on the news Monday afternoon, releasing this statement: \n“I am saddened by the allegations, and just learned about the charges along with the public. Still, Mr. Brown is presumed innocent while the investigations continue. It would be inappropriate to provide any further comments.” \nThis story will be updated as more information becomes available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T05:32:20.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
