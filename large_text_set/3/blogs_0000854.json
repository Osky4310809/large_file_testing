Countless companies have been trying to give customers premium television channels at a fraction of the price that cable companies are charging, and the popular video platform is set to debut one of the most interesting services yet. \nAccording to Fast Company , YouTube will soon offer a monthly TV streaming service equipped with 40 channels—including ESPN, MSNBC, USA, and FX—for $35. While most of the major broadcast channels will also be available (like Fox and NBC), none of the Time Warner and Viacom-owned channels will appear on the platform. This might be an issue if you're a fan of CBS, MTV, Comedy Central, etc. \nThat $35 cost includes access for six accounts, an enhanced search function to find specific shows, and the ability to record shows through a Cloud-based DVR. The company will also offer up original programming, including what's already on the YouTube Red program. \nThere's no firm release date for this new service as of yet ( called YouTube TV ), but the company says to expect it within \"the coming months.\" In the meantime, here are a dozen other cord-cutting alternatives .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:11:38.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
