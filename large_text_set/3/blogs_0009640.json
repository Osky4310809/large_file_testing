Fillon has denied breaking the law. \nThe investigating judges’ move to place Fillon under formal investigation – which in the French justice system does not confirm wrongdoing but means investigators have serious grounds for pursuing the matter – increases the pressure on Fillon. \nHe has refused to step down as a candidate and has vowed to kickstart his campaign. Polls show that he could risk being knocked out in the first round vote in April, behind the far-right Front National’s Marine Le Pen and the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron. \nUnder French law, being put under formal investigation means there is “serious or consistent evidence” that points to probable involvement of a suspect in a crime. It is a step towards a trial but investigations can be dropped without proceeding to court. \nFillon’s summons to appear in front of judges in their office was expected to take place on Wednesday, but his lawyer said it had been brought forward. \nMore details soon...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:30:50.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
