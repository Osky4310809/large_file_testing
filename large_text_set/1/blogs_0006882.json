DeMille award. While most of Hollywood and the press were smitten by Streep, calling the speech \" powerful \" and \"brave,\" at least two celebrities were not: Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn. \nA somewhat hilarious screenshot caught the two in various stages of \"side-eye\" during Streep's acceptance speech. Vaughn in particular looks as though he's about to explode, whereas Gibson just kind of looks annoyed. The Conservative table was not feeling Meryl's speech. #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/zdxDFhCZ1r", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:13:50.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
