Controversy surrounds Ryzen's gameplay credentials. Digital Foundry investigates. By Richard Leadbetter Published 21/03/2017 \nWe're late with our Ryzen 7 review for a number of reasons, and some might argue that the key story has already been told. We can confirm that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X does indeed match and occasionally even exceed Intel's mighty Core i7 6900K octo-core/16-thread monster on a great many benchmarks and heavily multi-threaded workloads. By this measure alone, AMD's return to a competitive footing in the x86 processor market is a remarkable achievement. But equally, our own tests confirm less impressive results posted by many: Ryzen 7's gaming performance does not match up to Intel's on most titles. The question is - why? \nOne aspect we have to take into account is that the AM4 Summit Ridge platform is in its earliest days. We used two boards during our testing, an MSI X370 XPower Gaming Titanium and an Asus ROG Crosshair 6 Hero - both supplied by AMD - but try as we might, the supplied Corsair 3000MHz DDR4 modules in our press package would not work at anything like their stated frequencies. AMD suggested loosened latency timings and lower bandwidth, but we still couldn't get it to work as it should (despite other reviewers with the same kit getting better results). \nOur review would concentrate on gaming performance and as all of our recent CPU reviews have revealed, in-game frame-rates have a close relationship with clock-speed and memory frequency. Things are improving though - GSkill provided new Flare X-branded modules that feature low C14 latency and 3200MHz speed. On our MSI board, equipped with a fresh BIOS, everything just worked - 'A-XMP' set-up almost everything to spec, though DRAM voltage needed to be manually set. Our test system, featuring the MSI Xpower Gaming Titanium \nAMD provided motherboards, coolers, processors and memory to the majority of the specialist press, including Digital Foundry. Different outlets received different boards paired with different processors - with Asus, Gigabyte and MSI represented as partners for the Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700. We received the 1800X initially along with the MSI Xpower Gaming Titanium - one of the most feature-packed and indeed expensive boards available based on the X370 chipset. \nDefinitely skewed to the luxury end of the market, the Xpower Gaming Titanium features a unique faux-metallic colour scheme paired with the usual top-end features - support for high-end storage including six SATA-3 ports, twin M.2 connections and an additional U.2 port. The 'steel armour' PCI Express ports support both CrossFire and SLI, while there's no shortage of USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and Type-C support. \nIntel provides the Gigabit LAN controller, with Realtek's ALC1220 codec in play. Additional headers are provided for those looking to watercool their system, while the board curiously has a surfeit of ATX power inputs - the usual 24-pin and eight-pin inputs are joined by further four-pin and six-pin sockets. \nWe didn't have much luck with the supplied Corsair DDR4 modules, but GSkill stepped in to provide one of its new Flare X branded kits - two 8GB modules with low 14-14-14-34 latency and 3200MHz bandwidth. We had no problem integrating these modules into the system to achieve the best results possible for memory performance on the fledgling platform. \nIt's worth noting that we compared the Ryzen 7 1800X to Intel system's using legacy data from our previous Kaby Lake reviews. Here we used four sticks of Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM rated at 3000MHz with 15-17-17-35 latency. This same memory was used to benchmark the Core i7 6900K and i7 5960X. However, here, the XMP profile boosted base clock to 125MHz, overclocking processors. \nWe dropped the base clock based to its standard 100MHz, necessitated an overclock here to 3200MHz. Because we used four modules, the X99 platform defaulted to quad-channel memory mode, potentially offering a significant bandwidth advantage over both the 7700K and the Ryzen system. \nGame on! Or rather... not. There's the sense that despite its lengthy gestation period, Ryzen isn't fully integrated with Windows yet, meaning that AMD wants us to make a number of changes for best performance. Dipping into the Windows 10 power profile, AMD recommends changing the setting from the standard balanced to high performance mode. The Windows high precision event timer needs to be disabled to add a few points to the performance scale. There are other tips AMD proffers, designed to push Ryzen performance higher in gaming scenarios, and we'll discuss those in due course. Rich's extended video review of the Ryzen 7 1800X. So just what is going on with Ryzen's gaming performance? Buy the Ryzen 7 1800X [?] from Amazon with free shipping. \nOnce set-up though, it's clear that Ryzen does indeed meet the hype in many respects, particularly with its multi-threading capabilities. The results across the web demonstrating this are legion, but just to cover the bases, below you'll find our Cinebench R15 results along with h.264 and HEVC Handbrake encoding tests, based on transcoding one of our demanding 4K videos. Ryzen is faster than the 6900K on h.264, but the Intel chip takes point with intense HEVC encoding. HEVC has more of a focus on AVX2 instructions - an area where AMD has an architectural disadvantage. Regardless, the Intel eight-core chip is only 11 per cent ahead. Scalability with HEVC seems to need some work though - the i7 7700K isn't so far behind. That particular i7 may lack cores, but its frequency is higher, which still seems to count for a lot. \nBut it's the gaming side of things where Ryzen has provoked the most controversy. In terms of single-thread and multi-thread performance, Cinebench tests - and many others - confirm that Ryzen 7 1800X is competitive with a chip Intel sells that costs twice as much, while Ryzen 7 1700X and stand a good chance of overclocking to something close to 1800X performance. With such fundamental validation on one set of number-crunching workloads, it stands to reason that Ryzen should perform in a similar manner on another: gaming - but it doesn't. \nFirst up, a look at our test system and an explanation of how we benchmark CPUs. We're mostly using parts supplied by an AMD - MSI's X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium is a beautiful, top-tier motherboard, but we've swapped out the Corsair 3000MHz Vengeance LPX that we couldn't push beyond 2400MHz with GSkill's freshly minted low-latency C14 3200MHz Ryzen-validated modules. XMP isn't supported natively by AMD (it's an Intel format), which may have led to some of our compatibility issues, but all major manufacturers have their own emulation of the system. In the case of the MSI board, it instantly locked onto the correct timings and frequency for the GSkill modules, but the latest BIOS is required for this level of 'plug and play' compatibility. AMD also supplied an EK Predator 240 closed-loop watercooler - a monstrous piece of kit.
