Shares \nUpdate: Recent images and videos have left us in little doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have a 3.5mm headphone jack. \nOne of the biggest questions in tech last year was whether Apple would keep the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 or lose it in favor of Bluetooth and a Lightning cable adapter. \nYou know how that one ended. Apple decided it was time to say goodbye to the 3.5mm port, and quite a few people were unhappy about it. \nExactly why the tech was dropped hasn't been made clear – the iPhone 7 wasn't any thinner than previous phones – but the decision has had a ripple effect in the smartphone industry. \nFor example, the HTC 10 Evo and Moto Z (though the latter actually got there before Apple)don't have a headphone jack and it's certain that other phone makers will soon drop the aging tech too. \nThe big question, though, is whether Samsung will follow suit. There are plenty of rumors out there, so here's everything we've heard so far about whether the Galaxy S8 will keep its headphone jack. December 2016 – first word that it's gone \nUpdate: \nBack in December last year we saw a rumor from trusted Samsung fan blog SamMobile, which cited sources claiming the Galaxy S8 would leave the headphone jack behind. \nThe sources claimed the Galaxy S8 would still have wired headphones, but instead you'd use them through a USB-C adapter. It’d be the first time Samsung had used a USB-C on the Galaxy S line, but it makes sense that the tech would finally come to its flagship phone range. \nProblem is, SamMobile didn’t reveal its sources, leaving some doubt as to whether the rumor was true – and SamMobile has reported on other stories since that suggest the Galaxy S8 may in fact keep the legacy tech. Read the full story January 2017 – a new case leak \nIn early January 2016 a case render leaked for the Galaxy S8, which featured a slot ready for a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone.

Read the full story January 2017 – another source claims it's there \nAfter the case above leaked, Android Police began speaking to its sources familiar with Samsung, and reported “with a high degree of confidence” that the Galaxy S8 is set to launch with a headphone jack. \nEditor David Ruddock said: “This information, I assure you, is not based on phone cases or renders thereof. The source has also proved reliable in the past.” February 2017 - headphone jack caught on camera \nBy February we were starting to see images that supposedly showed the Samsung Galaxy S8 itself, such as the one below, which clearly shows a 3.5mm headphone jack. Credit: Weibo \nIf accurate - and it certainly looks believable - the question of whether or not the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have a headphone port has been answered. Read the full story February 2017 - a video emerges \nIf static images aren't good enough for you, then how about a video? The clip below leaked in late February and although it's low quality you can just about see a 3.5mm headphone port at around 28 seconds in. Read the full story March 2017 - another close look \nIn early March we got one of our clearest looks yet at a 3.5mm headphone port on a phone believed to be the Samsung Galaxy S8. The handset is in a case, but there's a clear port and accompanying cutout for it. Credit: BGR Read the full story March 2017 - earphones leaked \nWe've seen shots and videos of the headphone port on the Samsung Galaxy S8, and now, thanks to gigglehd , we've even seen earphones, supposedly built for the S8, with a 3.5mm connector. Credit: Gigglehd \nThere's no way to confirm that these are designed for the S8, but they're AKG-branded, as we were expecting . Later in 2017 – when will the Galaxy S8 launch? \nSamsung is set to announce the Galaxy S8 on March 29 , so the wait is almost over. We'll know for sure then whether Samsung is going to kill or keep the 3.5mm headphone jack, but despite early rumors we now have little doubt that the port is here to stay - at least for one more year.
