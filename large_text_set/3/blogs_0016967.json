He never prayed, and he drank. But under the effects of alcohol and cannabis, this is where one ends up,” the father said. \nEurope 1 did not give his name. \nThe father was released from police custody overnight on Saturday, while Belgacem’s brother and a cousin were released later on Sunday. The sequence of events \nEarly on Saturday morning, Belgacem was stopped at a checkpoint in Garges-les-Gonesse, north of Paris. \nHe fired at police with a pellet gun before escaping in a car that was later found abandoned. \nPolice say he then stole a car at gunpoint from a woman at Vitry, south of Paris. That car was later found at Orly airport. \nBelgacem arrived at the airport and attacked a military patrol in the south terminal. \nHe tried to seize a servicewoman’s automatic weapon, put his gun to her head and said: “I’m here to die for Allah. In any case people are going to die.” \nHe was then shot dead by two other soldiers. \nA copy of the Koran was found on his body, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins added. Media caption “The attacker was holding the soldier by her neck” \nThe BBC’s Hugh Schofield in Paris says the picture is building up of a man on the criminal fringes of society, who also consorted with Islamist radicals. \nThe attack came at a sensitive time. France has presidential elections starting next month and remains under a state of emergency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:13:59.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
