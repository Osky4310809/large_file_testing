Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKim Kardashian has only just returned from Dubai, but it was already straight back to business in Los Angeles for the reality star. \nThe mum-of-two was joined by hubby Kanye West and sister Kourtney as Keeping Up With The Kardashians cameras filmed them enjoying a bite to eat at Hugo's restaurant. \nKim, 36, opted for a rather low-key look made up of light denim ripped jeans, Yeezy Season 2 tan boots, a white T-shirt and a black and red plaid shirt for the outing. \nInstead, it was yummy mummy Kourtney who really stole the show in an all-white look that featured a tummy-baring top, white jeans and a long white jacket. \nShe paired the look witih Yeezy perspex heels and rounded showbiz sunnies. \nKanye, 39, was also sporting ripped jeans which he teamed with a light grey hooded sweater and white trainers.

On one hand, they will melt the metal, and on the other, they will usually cut the stones completely, in order to remove all markings or modify the shape. Because if there is a typical shape in exceptional jewellery, if there is a ring in the shape of a cushion, they can perhaps cut it in circles.\" Kim Kardashian leaves lunch with hubby Kanye West and sister Kourtney Kardashian (Photo: Juliano-Daddy/X17online.com) Kim Kardashian leaves lunch with hubby Kanye West and sister Kourtney Kardashian (Photo: Juliano-Daddy/X17online.com) \nWithout alteration, the 36-year-old television personality's ring - which was a gift from Kanye - would have been easily recognised as it had the word 'Adidas' carved into it. \nAnd Guillochon believes the ring would have been altered using lasers before it was sold on the black market in Antwerp, Belgium. \nTwo of those arrested - Aomar Ait Khedache and Didier Dubreucq - were reportedly living in the city since October and detectives believe they moved there so they could get rid of the jewellery as soon as possible.
