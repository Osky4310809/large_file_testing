By Ted Spiker   10:47 am Rigoberto Martinez during the Runner’s World Half Marathon in October 2016. Photograph courtesy of ©2016 MYEPEVENTS.COM \nRigoberto (Rigo) Martinez started running five years ago the way a lot of us do—to improve his health, feel better, and drop some weight. I met Rigo because he was part of our Sub-30 Club , and when I saw him run the Runner’s World Half & Festival —determined to crush his goal—I could see the drive and grit in his strides. \nIt’s that same determination that has helped him lose a lot of weight. Down to 199 pounds from an all-time high of 278, he’s nailed a lot of his running goals — like running a negative split in his first marathon, New York City , last year in 4:47. Running three days a week, he now has his sights on a new distance.   \n“The running community has been a welcome and warm community,” Rigo says. “I have been encouraged with every step I have taken in training and out on the course. A healthy life does require a healthy social life in my opinion. You never have to run or walk alone.” \nI caught up with Rigo to learn more about his overall transformation through running. \nHow did running help you lose all that weight? It gave me the discipline and patience necessary. I have lost weight before but never seemed to maintain the eating habits nor the exercise routines. \nHow did losing all that weight help your running? There’s less of me to move. I don't feel like my legs are moving fast and the rest of me is lagging behind. I don't have my belly flopping up and down. Also having less weight around my midsection has helped my breathing. It’s easier to catch my breath now. \nHow did you deal with the hunger that a lot of people associate with running a lot of miles? I still struggle. Some strategies that I used are eating more fruits and more filling foods on days that I run. For example, I eat a well the night before a long run and I eat a light breakfast the morning of the run. When I finish, I try to eat a fruit like an apple or a pear afterward and drink plenty of water to hold me over until the next full meal. \nWhat were other keys to losing the weight? Doing weight loss socially. Involving your family and friends keeps you accountable. The ones closest to your may help encourage your progress and keep your head up when you fall behind. I go to a weight loss group (Weight Watchers), and that has given a tremendous boost to my nutrition and relationship with food. I realized my weight loss goals could use a social touch when I made strides in my running after joining my local track club. \nSpeaking of which, you just won the most improved runner award for your track club. Tell us about it. I became a member of my local track club (Van Cortlandt Track Club in the Bronx) last year. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the club and their regular workouts. Members really took care of me during a half marathon where I went to the medical tent for about half an hour. I ended up finishing the race very slowly, but members made sure I was okay and gave me plenty of advice. That led to improving my diet and led to better training efforts. My race times vastly improved, and the club awarded me and another runner Most Improved Male Runner for 2016. I was really touched and proud to receive the award. \nYou had some great races at the Runner’s World Half & Festival in 2016. The RW Half is a fantastic course. This was my third time running the half. I had crushed personal records in the 5K and 10K the day before. I set out slowly, but as soon as I hit the downhills, I let it fly. This works for me as the course has quite a few hills. I made sure to slow down on the flat terrains. The biggest help was keep up with the 2:05 pace group. I eventually passed the group running into the SteelStacks (finishing in 2:04, half PR is 1:58). \nWhat’s next? I am trying to meter my expectations, but I am planning on running the local 60K run. I don't know if I will attempt that this year or next. My other goal is to run the NYC Marathon again and run it in 4:30 or less. \n* * * \nTed Spiker does not have a piece of fruit after long runs, but he might start.
