Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump’s nominee for White House budget director, apparently doesn’t know much about payroll taxes. The New York Times reports he admitted to not paying state or federal taxes for a babysitter he and his wife employed. Advertisement \nMulvaney reportedly made the admission on a questionnaire he submitted to the Senate Budget Committee, so while he may be in no way qualified for the job he’s applying for, at least he’s honest? Silver linings are everywhere, if you believe hard enough. The specifics, via the Times : \nIn a questionnaire provided to the committee, Representative Mick Mulvaney , a conservative from South Carolina and vocal proponent of fiscal restraint noted, “I have come to learn during the confirmation review process that I failed to pay FICA and federal and state unemployment taxes on a household employee for the years 2000-2004.” \nMr. Mulvaney said he had subsequently paid more than $15,000 in taxes and awaits the state tax bill, as well as penalties and interests. His confirmation hearing before the committee is scheduled for Jan. 24. The employee was a babysitter hired when Mr. Mulvaney and his wife had triplets in 2000. \nThis type of admission has derailed plenty of applicants before him, but then again, so did sexual assault allegations against presidential candidates. It’s a new world, baby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:18:53.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
