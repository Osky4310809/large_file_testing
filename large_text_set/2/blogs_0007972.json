That was all it took for Pescara to start unravelling at Torino’s Stadio Olimpico. A pair of defenders failed to prevent Antonio Barreca sending a cross over from the left, a third was outjumped inside the box by Marco Benassi and two more lunged hopelessly after Iago Falqué as he pounced on the loose ball and drove it into the roof of the net. \nWithin 15 minutes, Torino had trebled their lead. It was 5-0 by the 61st. Pescara’s manager, Marco Oddo, tucked himself into a corner of the visitors’ dugout and allowed the tears to well up in his eyes. \nThat Pescara should lose was hardly a shock. Theirs has been one of the worst seasons of any club in Serie A history. The Delfini arrived in Turin with nine points from 23 games, and three of those were awarded to them after Sassuolo fielded an ineligible player. Oddo’s team have not beaten anyone on the pitch in this entire league campaign. Bordeaux are being held back by perseverance with Jérémy Ménez Read more \nBut he had hoped against hope that this game could be different. Hoped because he is an optimist, a man who sees his empty glass as half-full and his undertalented squad as halfway-capable. Hoped because Torino were themselves without a win in six matches. Hoped because his team, and his town, needed some way to heal after the ugliest of weeks. \nOn Tuesday morning the club president, Daniele Sebastiani, had woken to the sound of an explosion and his home alarm system wailing. His Jeep was in flames on the driveway, and his Smart Car beside it was also catching. Firefighters were called and managed to prevent further damage to the house or his son’s car parked nearby, but together with the police they confirmed that this was no accident or rogue electrical fault: Sebastiani had been the subject of an arson attack. \nAlthough no arrests have yet been made public, investigators are reported to be focusing their attention on sections of the Pescara fanbase . Protests against the president and the team have been a running theme of this season, gathering in momentum and intensity as the season has deteriorated. \nThe club’s Christmas dinner was disrupted by ultras who waited outside with a banner reading “ Vergognatevi!!! ” – “Be ashamed!!!” On that occasion, punches and kicks were aimed the cars of players and staff, who were exhorted to boycott the meal on the grounds that there was nothing in this season to celebrate. \nHundreds of fans then gathered to demonstrate outside the players’ exit at Pescara’s home ground – the Stadio Adriatico – after they lost 3-0 to Bologna. Results have scarcely improved since. Pescara did draw their next game, away to Palermo, but had lost their first five of 2017 even before heading to Turin. \nThe nadir seemed to have arrived at the start of this month. On 5 February, two days before the attack on Sebastiani’s cars, Pescara were beaten 6-2 at home by Lazio. \nSebastiani was targeted for abuse throughout the match, and afterwards suggested that he might consider walking away from the club. But if the arsonists were motivated by a desire to push him out then it is possible their actions will backfire. During subsequent interviews, he offered a suspicion that this was more than just mindless aggression – hinting that someone could be trying to drive down the price of the team. \n“I don’t know if this was the act of some vandals or if there was some hidden leadership,” said Sebastiani. “It’s an act which throws mud over this city and our club which had won back credibility after dark years. [But] I’m not going to sell my shares to delinquents or people who think they can acquire them through an act of this sort … If I want to buy a suit, I go to a shop, I ask the price and I pay. If, instead, I set fire to the shop in order to buy the suit, then this is extortion, not a purchase.” \nPart of a consortium of local business people who bought the club out of bankruptcy in 2009, Sebastiani assumed the presidency two years later, and in that role has twice guided them into Serie A – a division that they had not graced since the early 1990s. But the first of his top-flight campaigns ended in a last-place finish and a minus-57 goal difference. This one is going even worse. \nFans accuse Sebastiani of failing to invest the income generated by these promotions into building a stronger team and better structures to fall back on. He has countered that the gulf between Italy’s haves and have-nots that is simply too wide to bridge. \nIronically, Pescara’s lack of spending power almost rescued them on Sunday. Over the summer, they pursued a transfer for Arlind Ajeti, only to for Torino to gazump them at the last moment. The Albania defender has barely played for the Granata , but made the starting XI on Sunday and scored his team’s second goal. \nAt the other end, though, he was a disaster. Ajeti killed Torino’s hopes of a clean sheet by diverting a cross into his own net in the 73rd minute. Little more than 60 seconds later, his woeful marking on Gianluca Caprari allowed the striker to scuff a shot into the path of Ahmed Benali, who scored at the back post. Benali then added another, after a goalmouth scramble that began with Ajeti sending an attempted clearance straight to a Pescara player. \nFrom 5-0 down, Pescara had fought back to 5-3. But it was too little, too late. The visitors fell to their 17th defeat of this league season. \nThere were reports afterwards that Oddo had resigned, but at time of writing there has been no official communication from the club beyond the words of the sporting director, Luca Leone, who said at full-time that “both my position and his are in the balance”. What is clear is that nobody has suffered this season more than the manager, himself born and raised in Pescara. \nIt is not the first time we have seen him weep. He cried at the start of this month, after Pescara let a late lead slip in a 2-1 defeat against Fiorentina. It is at once a sad image and a far more welcome one, for this team and this town, than that of burned out cars being lifted from a driveway.
