States of emergency have now been declared in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut as a result of the storm, which is being classified as a nor’easter.\nDe Blasio said officials were still weighing a travel ban as of 6 p.m. Monday. Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has already imposed one statewide beginning at 5 a.m. Tuesday.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Tuesday’s blizzard will ultimately consist of two larger storm systems — which have merged together into one. The end result is “a very strong winter storm that could be life-threatening for those who do not pay attention to safety precautions Tuesday morning,” the agency said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T05:06:41.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
