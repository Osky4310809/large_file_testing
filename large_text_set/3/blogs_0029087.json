The cast of The Fresh Prince reunite for an instagram photo (Photo: therealalfonsoribeiro/Instagram) Will with Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv \nWhile we were all laughing at the gang’s weekly hi-jinks, there was drama behind the scenes, as actress Janet appeared to blame Will for her exit from the show and would go on to publicly slam him on multiple occasions. \n\"There will never be a reunion ... as I will never do anything with an a**hole like Will Smith,\" Janet, 61, said back in 2011, after previous rumours of a reunion surfaced. \n\"He is still an egomaniac and has not grown up. This constant reunion thing will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn't know the word.\" \nThe bad blood became public back in 2003 when Janet departed the show, to be replaced by Daphne Maxwell Reid, and it’s fair to say Janet hasn’t exactly shied away from slamming Will in the press and telling her side of the story. Janet claims to have beef with Will \nTo date, Will is believed to have made just one negative comment about Janet, and actually lavished her with praise in an interview last year, choosing to take the high ground despite her remarks about him in the press. \n\"I think she’s brilliant,\" said Will. \"So I loved what she brought to The Fresh Prince.\" \nOther than that, he's said absolutely nothing about the alleged feud or addressed any of Janet's public comments about him. \nHere's how it all played out: 2003 - Will tells radio station he's the Antichrist to Janet \nShortly after Janet left the sitcom, its star Will is quoted as making his only negative public comment about Janet and her departure during an interview with an Atlanta radio station. \n“I can say straight up that Janet Hubert wanted the show to be The Aunt Viv of Bel Air Show because I know she is going to dog me in the press. She has basically gone from a quarter of a million dollars a year to nothing. She said once, 'I've been in the business for 10 years and this snotty-nosed punk comes along and gets a show.' No matter what, to her I'm just the Antichrist.\" 2009: Alfonso Ribeiro disses Janet in a university Q&A \nAccording to reports , the actor told an audience at the State University of New York at Oneonta: “I had an absolutely amazing time working with Will, with Tatyana [Ali] and James [Avery] and Karyn [Parsons] and everybody was great. First mom? Not so much. \n“She made it very difficult for us to work and unfortunately, she was then fired.\" (Photo: Google) 2009: Janet accuses Will of destroying her career \nJanet tells BV on Books: “ Will Smith and Alfonso [Ribeiro, who played Carlton Banks] destroyed a 20-year-career with untruths. I got slammed. Will apologized later in an Essence magazine article, but it still lingers. It's still there.\" 2009: Janet lashes out at Will in autobiography \nHer book, Perfection Is Not A Sitcom Mom, does not paint Will in the best light, nor do the interviews to accompany the autobiography's release. 2011: Janet calls Will an \"a**hole\" \n\"There will never be a reunion ... as I will never do anything with an a**hole like Will Smith,\" Janet told TMZ. \"He is still an egomaniac and has not grown up. This constant reunion thing will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn't know the word.\" The entire Fresh Prince cast of season 2 (Photo: NBC Universal) 2013: Janet accuses Will of \"heinous things\" - and a U-Turn \nIn an interview with OMG! Insider, Janet acknowledges Will was a great guy when she started on Fresh Prince but went on to say she felt \"demonised, beaten up and crucified\" for years as nobody had her back. \n\"[Will Smith] said, 'We're just going to replace her and act like nothing happened',\" she claimed. \"Well, honey, that is not what happened, is it?\" \nShe accused Will of doing \"some heinous, horrible things to me\" without elaborating, and in a surprise U-Turn said she was open to meeting up. \"We need to have a reunion, we have to end this horrible, 21-year war. I think we all owe each other an apology.\" 2013: Janet claims she was offered less episodes ahead of Fresh Prince exit \nJanet told Grio that she left after being offered 10 episodes for the next season on the alleged provision she couldn't act or perform anywhere else; she claimed that meant a $150,000 salary drop, which she didn't want. \n“It was a negotiation that should have come back like most do,” she said. “We were a very successful show and I felt like I was an integral part of that, and felt valuable, but you cannot feel valuable in Hollywood.” Janet left after series 3 (Photo: NBC Universal) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T16:16:11.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
