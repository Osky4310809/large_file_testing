They go on to report that the scene will show off the young hero’s American education at Saint Mary’s College High School in Berkeley. \nPart of the character’s origin in the comic books is him leaving his home of Wakanda to attend the best schools in America and the UK, having graduated from Oxford University with a Ph.D. in Physics, though it seems his schooling in the film will be more of a fun Easter egg as it’s the alma mater of director Ryan Coogler. \nMichael Keaton Talks The Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming \nMichael Keaton took time out to talk about his role as Adrian Toomes — a.k.a. The Vulture — in Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios‘ upcoming Spider-Man: Homecoming . \n“Not to give too much away, but interestingly, he is and he isn’t, that character,” Keaton said of The Vulture being a villain. “He’s a really interesting — and more interesting than I thought — villain because there’s parts of him that you go, ‘You know what? I might see his point.’ Really, really. It makes it interesting to play.” \nThe actor broke big in the late ’80s/early ’90s playing Batman, and then later skewered superhero culture in the Oscar-winning Birdman . However, he seemed to have no hesitation in diving back into the comic book movie well. \n“No, I mean, not at all. It’s just a thing. A gig,” Keaton stated. “I don’t mean it’s just a gig, it’s the next job. And you think you can do it or want to do it and in fact I said no, because I couldn’t, it didn’t work in my schedule. Then I’m glad to say, they kind of shifted the scheduling and it worked out. So it fit in and I’m glad I did it.” \nKaren Gillan Talks Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Teases Avengers Appearance \nActress Karen Gillan is set to return to the cosmos of the Marvel Universe with this year’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as the cyborg assassin Nebula, and she previewed a bit of what we can expect from her character in the sequel. \n“What I love about the second movie for Nebula in particular is that we get — We know that she’s a pretty angry woman with some daddy issues. [But] in the second movie, we’re going to start to see how much pain her father actually caused her, and we’re going to delve right into the relationship with her sister Gamora. I think we might even feel a tinge of sympathy towards Nebula this time, because we really start to see the emotional crack in her character, ” she added. “I was just allowed to completely explore that and take it to a completely different dimension with her. I was really happy about that.” \nIn related news, she offered a tidbit for the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War , saying, “I’ll be making a little appearance in the next Avengers movies.” \nCeline Dion to Perform All-New Song for Beauty and the Beast \nFive-time Grammy winning and best-selling recording artist Celine Dion will perform an all-new original song, “How Does A Moment Last Forever,” for Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast . The song will also be included on the film’s soundtrack. Check out the soundtrack cover in the gallery below, along with a new triptych poster and international posters! \nWritten by eight-time Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken ( The Little Mermaid , Aladdin ) and veteran lyricist and three-time Oscar winner Tim Rice ( The Lion King , Evita ), “How Does A Moment Last Forever” is an emotional ballad about holding onto life’s precious moments. Portions of the song are performed throughout the film and interpolated into the underscore before Dion’s full-length version debuts in the film’s custom main-on-end title design. \nSays Dion, “Being a part of the original ‘Beauty and the Beast’ was such a magical experience in my life, and I’m truly honored to be a part of this film again.” Jump for Joy as you uncover these hidden objects in @DisneyPixar films! pic.twitter.com/fivVkuJWG0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T05:33:57.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
