UGE International , one of the world's leading renewable-energy contractors, will be partnering with Gotham Community Solar to develop a new array at a multi-tenant commercial facility between the Park Slope and Boerum Hill neighborhoods in Brooklyn. The project, which is scheduled to be completed in early summer, will have a rated peak capacity of roughly 100 kilowatts, according to UGE.\n\n\nThe building abuts another UGE project: the Whole Foods Market at 214 3rd Street, colloquially known as â€œ3rd and 3rd\" by locals.\n\"It's been a privilege to work with ConEd , the Department of Buildings, and the project's ownership group on developing this landmark project\" Tim Woodcock, UGE's Regional Director, said in a statement.\nRelated: UGE is building a massive rooftop solar array atop this popular Brooklyn church \nWoodcock anticipates selling any surplus power to nearby residents at rates lower than those offered by their utility companies. The benefits would be twofold: cheaper electricity that also comes from a sustainable source.\n\"The solar power generated by the project will be credited to numerous residential accounts, offering access to the benefits and low cost of solar energy to those previously excluded due to their housing situation,\" he added.\n\n+ UGE International \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:10:05.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
