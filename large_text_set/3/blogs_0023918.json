Source: Getty Images \n“The Jedi or The Beard to be Feared as we like to call him is fast becoming a firm fans’ favourite at Villa Park,” he explained. \n“Why? Because he has been a man mountain in the heart of the midfield; keeping team-mates either side of him in check and, more importantly, acting as a protective shield in front of the back four.” \nHe added: “Can he become as important to Villa as he was to Crystal Palace when they were promoted? Yes, most definitely. \n“Experienced players seem to be a forgotten breed nowadays – especially in the Championship – with managers opting for your much younger box-to-box players who can run all day. \n“Jedinak’s know-how can be invaluable next season and his manager, Steve Bruce, knows that. Leadership, in any division, is priceless and the rest of the Villa squad will lean on that as and when required.” \nThere were a few concerns over Jedinak’s initiation, however, at a time where he also arguably wasn’t at his best in green and gold towards the end of last year as well.

At the start of the season the 32-year-old looked laboured, sluggish and, at times, played as if he was running through treacle,” he said. \n“Jedinak looked unfit and took his time to adjust to the blood and thunder of the Championship. He wasn’t very good, put it that way. \n“What didn’t help, though, was Villa’s previous manager, Roberto Di Matteo, who recruited a somewhat top-heavy squad in the summer which left Jedinak looking helpless in a two-man midfield alongside Ashley Westwood. \n“It’s fair to say it didn’t work. Jedinak needs more bodies by his side, that’s for sure.” \nPostecoglou won’t want to leave his skipper exposed, either, in whichever midfield formation he opts for in the double header against Iraq and United Arab Emirates. \nVilla boss Steve Bruce has, however, provided food for thought for Postecoglou down the track by playing Jedinak at centre-back in recent weeks. \nPreece believes that won’t be a one-off, while Bruce has suggested it’s a way 32-year-old Jedinak can prolong his career.

The boy down the road at West Brom, Gareth McAuley, he’s 37. \n“It does prolong your career. There’s not many players playing in midfield at 37, 38. \n“You can’t expect to be trampling round the midfield area being 6ft 3in. \n“It’s something I’ll have a conversation with Mile about and it gave me food for thought last week. \n“He was excellent and very comfortable. \n“Midfielders, when they go back, they do find the position easy because they’re used to handling the ball because everything is in front of them.” Socceroo skipper Mile Jedinak. Source: News Corp Australia \nPreece says: “Jedinak was brilliant when he slotted into the heart of the defence alongside James Chester against Sheffield Wednesday a fortnight ago. He came up against one of the hottest goal-scorers in the league – Jordan Rhodes – and bossed him. It was certainly a shrewd move by Bruce that day. \n“The manager, in Villa’s last match against Wigan, decided to start him at centre-back following a good showing against Wednesday. \n“However, in the first half, a casual-looking Jedinak was guilty of a suicidal back pass which left Wigan forward Omar Bogle in on goal. Bogle, a much quicker front man than Rhodes, rounded the keeper only to fire into the side netting. \n“Villa’s centre-back options include skipper Chester, the injured Nathan Baker, Tommy Elphick and Micah Richards, with the latter two struggling to get into the side under Bruce. So much so that the manager opted for Jedinak at centre-half instead of so-called ‘proper’ defenders.” \nUltimately, Jedinak has become a “presence” for Villa in the middle of the park, be it in midfield, or defence. \nWhile compatriot Aaron Mooy has bagged headlines, making the Championship’s Team of the Season, his national team captain has made his own, if different, impact. \n“He struggled to adapt to the pace early on which wasn’t helped by playing alongside another deep-lying midfielder in Westwood,” he said. Sam Baldock of Brighton holds off Mile Jedinak of Aston Villa Source: Getty Images \n“His pass completion stands at 66 per cent for the 27 league games he has played, which is somewhat low compared to other midfielders in his position: Dale Stephens at Brighton (87 per cent); Jack Colback at Newcastle (86 per cent) and Mooy at Huddersfield (83 per cent). \n“Competiveness, though, is where Jedinak comes into his own. He tops stats for interceptions (59) and blocks (18) in the Championship while he also wins 71.82 per cent of his aerial duals. Jedinak’s a beast in the air which is certainly one of his best traits. \n“He’s also got a great knack of being in the right place at the right time, therefore winning his fair share of challenges and, in turn, winning back possession for his team-mates.” \nFor those Socceroos fans who question his passing accuracy or debate his contribution compared to more creative midfielders available, Bruce offered this evaluation last week before beating Wigan. \n“He plays with a fierce determination and he’s a typical Aussie, isn’t he? \n“He’s ready for a fight; supporters forgive a bad pass and lots of things when they see somebody that it means something to them and they try. Mile has got all of them credentials. \n“What you see is what you get. He’s as tough as teak; hard as nails and proper old school if you like who has done very, very well for the club.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
