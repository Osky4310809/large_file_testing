However, there are still some subtle nuances you may forget or not know about during the interview that can really cost you the job. Here are some red flags interviewers tend to watch out for.\n1. You focus the interview around you. Interviewers can pick up on a \"me, me, me\" mentality, so make sure that whenever you answer the question, you're not talking about what you want and instead talking about how you want to help the company grow. If you do want to talk about your needs, make sure it aligns with the company's success.\n2. You don't take the time to think about your answer. OK, so you got taken off guard. Many people jump to the first thing they think of because they feel like they need to respond ASAP. And oftentimes blurting what's on your mind isn't always the smartest or rational answer. Take the time to gather your thoughts, even if it means having a bit of silence. Don't worry about the pause in conversation turning off your interviewer, she will most likely appreciate you taking the time to think about your answer. And if you don't know the answer to the question, don't panic. Here's what to do you if you don't know how to answer a question.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/_hQ1fTvDnYYIqjBcgGKS070hJqo/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2015/07/15/026/n/1922398/fbb7058c__OO_3143_edited.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-19T14:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:35:29.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
