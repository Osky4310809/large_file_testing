Heâ€™s on a bike (kinda) and in the air. Pictured below is Ken Roczen in a slightly less desired position. His arm has been opened up. Advertisement \nAs another obvious warning, this is super grody and my coworker could not look at it up on his screen. \nYes, thatâ€™s his whole arm opened up. Advertisement \nDonâ€™t feel bad, this is part of the healing process. Roczen gave a full damage report a few days ago: \nDislocated wrist, dislocated elbow and compounded radius. The first 30h absolutely sucked as none of the pain killers worked and it was really swollen. Gonna need few surgeries to get all this dialed. ðŸ”´ I have gotten so many messages and was so pleased to read all of them. I didnâ€™t message back as the circumstances right now are just a bit gnarly and it would probably take me a day to reply lol. Just know I saw them! Love all you! Gonna need a few days for further info.ï»¿", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:11:55.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
