The car only took one or two laps according to those who saw it, but that was just enough to get a good look at one of the two contenders for the top LMP1 class in the World Endurance Championship.

Like the final-generation Audi R18, it appears to have no standalone side rear-view mirrors.

Daily Sportscar thinks that the large headlamps may indicate a car built for night racing, though, so perhaps this is the one for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. \nYou can view the rest of Daily Sportscar’s round-up ofspy shots here . We’ll see all the Le Mans prototypes out in the open next weekend at the WEC Prologue in Monza.
