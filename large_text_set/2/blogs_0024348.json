They have also distributed a petition saying that the school’s president, Mark Schlissel, refuses to take them seriously. \nThe students of color are adamant about being segregated, just as the taxpayer-funded university is completing construction on a new $10 million black student center. \nThe students say the student center is quite nice but insufficient for their needs, “because we want a space solely dedicated to community organizing and social justice work specifically for people of color.” \nThe students continued in a demand letter that “We want documentation of past, current, and future student activism and this should be a permanent space that is staffed, and has resources for students to organize and share resources.” \nThey also want increased assistance for “marginalized” students who are allegedly victims of “oppressive attacks,” more “Black, Arab and PoC” faculty hired, better reporting of “bias incidents,” and more financial aid for poor students. \n“Our president has blatantly ignored us and it is time for us to speak up. We have been told that our demands are ‘rude,'” states a Facebook post . “We are calling on someone to care about students’ concerns and to lead us with integrity and help us fight against the oppression and hateful acts that try to destroy us and our community.” \nThough leaders of the Students4Justice were not available for comment, a campus spokesman did inform The College Fix that “at this point, our colleagues in Student Life have been working with the Students4Justice leaders to better understand their concerns. This is our normal process.” \nMichigan hasn’t broadcast the news that students on their campus are advocating neo-segregation, but the story leaked our through the Michigan Review, a student news service that first reported the ongoing conflict. \nFollow David on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:23:33.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
