They’re just much more terrifying versions of the already weird normal mascots. (Looking at you, Toronto.)\nYet, some of the regular mascots aren’t so bad. One I’ve always liked is Stuff the Magic Dragon. He’s cute and has little nose streamers. He’s also really good at taunting Robin Lopez . Just look at him.\nReinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Air Stuff? Not so much. Just look at this.\nWill someone put this monstrosity out of its misery?\nThe first time I watched this I was in disbelief. I thought the person inside was somehow hopping on their own head. My instinct told me that because Stuff was upside down, so must be the wearer of the costume.\nAfter several watches, I concluded that the costume is clearly top heavy, so the person inside can’t get his or her legs on the ground. The human is forced to turn over inside the costume, and hop off ON THE COSTUME’S HEAD.\nPeople, this is the stuff of nightmares. Not to mention all the impressionable children in attendance that might think they too, can hop on their heads because their good pal Stuff did it. Imagine all these children trying to bounce on their heads. The HORROR.\nPlease, for the love of all that is good, stop these inflatable monsters.
