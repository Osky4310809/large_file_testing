Voez mixes an anime style story with rhythm gameplay. \nIt's named Voez, a Japanese rhythm-action game that uses the Switch's touchscreen. \nThere are no button controls, publisher Flyhigh Works (FHW) has warned , so you can only play with the Switch in your hands. \n\"This software can not play in TV mode,\" FHW states. \nIt's the first Switch game we've heard of which doesn't offer the two modes of play - and our first acknowledgement Nintendo does not dictate this as necessary. \nSo, while Voez remains a niche title, this opens the door to other touchscreen games joining Switch without the need for a button-based mode. \nI'd love a Switch port of Mini Metro, a tube-building railway simulator I play constantly on iPhone. With a capacitive touchscreen finally in a Nintendo handheld, you've got to think mobile giants like King and Supercell might be interested, too. \nOr, while we're dreaming, how about touchscreen-based port of Hearthstone?
