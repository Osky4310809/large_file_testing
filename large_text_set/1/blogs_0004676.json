Brett Le Blanc/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @bleblancphoto By MAX MICHORLAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL \nThe North Las Vegas police detective who died early Saturday morning after suffering critical injuries in a Friday afternoon crash was Chad Parque, a 10-year veteran of the force. \nParque was 32. \n“He was a great husband, father, brother, and investigator,” North Las Vegas police said in a statement. “He will be deeply missed by many.” \nThe detective’s name was first released Saturday afternoon during the third annual Nevada Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, an event honoring officers from law enforcement agencies throughout the valley. \nIn an interview during the event, Sheriff Joe Lombardo of the Metropolitan Police Department said his thoughts and prayers go out Parque’s family and the North Las Vegas Police Department. “It hits home for everybody,” he said. \nLombardo said that when he went down to the University Medical Center trauma center, where the detective was fighting for his life Friday night, he found officers from law enforcement agencies across the valley had gathered to show their support. \nIt was a bittersweet experience, he said. “When I say it was bittersweet, it was bitter that we had to be there but it was sweet in that it shows the support — we’re a family because (these) people understand what we go through on a daily basis.” \nEarlier Saturday, the North Las Vegas Police Department had announced the detective had died. \n“It is with a heavy heart we announce the passing of our detective. Thank you for your continued love and support,” the department tweeted at 3:21 a.m. \nParque suffered critical injuries in a head-on collision with a vehicle traveling the wrong way on Martin Luther King Boulevard about 2 p.m. Friday while he was on duty. He had to be cut out of his vehicle. \nThe preliminary investigation indicates Parque was on duty when he was exiting the parking lot of the North Las Vegas Justice Court, located at 2428 North Martin Luther King Blvd., in a 2005 Ford Taurus department vehicle, police said in the statement. \nA white 2010 Nissan Versa was traveling south on Martin Luther King Boulevard, approaching Carey Avenue, when the driver entered the lanes of oncoming traffic, striking the detective’s vehicle, the statement said. A third vehicle, a white 2002 Chevrolet pickup truck, was traveling north when it struck the rear passenger door of the detective’s vehicle after the first collision. \nPolice said Friday that it was unclear if the 62-year-old woman driving the vehicle that struck him first was speeding or impaired, or if she had suffered a medical episode before the crash. She was taken to University Medical Center with non life-threatening injuries. \nThe 28-year-old male driver and 52-year-old male passenger in the truck were not injured and stayed on the scene, police said. \nFriends and family of the fallen officer have set up a donation fund called the “Injured Police Officer’s Fund.” These accounts are available at Nevada State Bank, account number 905202081 and at Wells Fargo, account number 8754899923. \nFuneral services will be announced at a later date. \nReview-Journal photographer Erik Verduzco and reporter Rachel Hershkovitz contributed to this report.
