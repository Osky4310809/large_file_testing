Google Street View/Screenshot \nWhen an apartment or penthouse isn't big enough for wealthy New Yorkers, they get creative.\nIn recent years, a number of them have combined multiple townhouses or building floors to create supersized homes, or Frankenmansions, as New York magazine's S. Jhoanna Robledo calls them.\nTo construct these Frankenmansions, some prospective buyers purchase multiple buildings at once, while others approach their neighbors to offer multimillion-dollar buyouts. (In either scenario, they need the city's subsequent approval before combining properties.)\nCheck out these 12 Manhattan Frankenmansions owned by big names — including Madonna, Sean Parker, and Sarah Jessica Parker — outlined below in red.\nView As: One Page Slides Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Frankenmansion is nearly complete. Google Street View/Screenshot Bloomberg has bought five of the six apartment units in the building next to his 7,500-square-foot townhouse over the last two decades. After connecting the floors in 2009, he grew his home to 12,500 square feet, according to The New York Post. The buildings are within steps of Central Park.\nA $19.75 million pair of townhouses is currently on the market. Google Street View/Screenshot The Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, an NYC-based convent of nuns, acquired the townhome on the right in 1948. Four years later, the group bought the one next door and connected them via a doorway on each floor . \nThroughout the years, the order has rented some of the complex's 25 bedrooms to other congregations or young women in need. But the Frankenmansion may soon find a new owner — the 15,600-square-foot space went on the market for $19.75 million in 2016, according to the New York Times. \n\n\nSarah Jessica Parker lives in a pair of twin townhouses worth $34.5 million. Google Street View/Screenshot The star of Sex and the City snatched the two brick townhouses above from the nonprofit United Methodist Women , then fused them together. The organization listed the pair of buildings (which were not connected) for $44 million in 2016, but Parker paid $34.5 million, according to The Real Deal. \nThe 13,900-square-foot mansion includes nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a 2,100-square-foot private garden, and five floors. \nNapster co-founder Sean Parker paid $58.5 million for his mega-mansion. Google Street View/Screenshot Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook, owns the three brownstones pictured above. Each building originally contained four apartment units, a grand stairwell, and a rear garden. The interior spaces feature arched doorways and original 19th century fireplaces with marble mantles. \nParker purchased the first building for $20 million in 2010, the second for $16.5 million in May 2016, and the third for a reported $22 million in August 2016. He completed the renovation to connect all three in late 2016. \nOnce a factory and showroom, this set of buildings will soon be one Frankenmansion. Google Street View/Screenshot Billionaire Jon Stryker is the rumored owner of the three brick buildings above, which NYC-based architecture firm Steven Harris Architects is working to turn into one residence. Curbed reported that Styker was probably the buyer of the $32 million set in 2012. The renovation project underwent an approval process from the city, which approved it in February 2017.\nIn their former lives, the buildings were an ice cream factory, a Steinway piano showroom, and a garage. The property's facade will stretch 41 feet from end to end. \nMadonna's $32 million Frankenmansion has 13 bedrooms. Google Street View/Screenshot In 2009, Madonna bought three connected townhouses on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The $32 million mansion features 13 bedrooms, a dance studio, multiple dining rooms, a 3,000-square-foot garden, two garages, an elevator, and a private gym, according to Curbed. \nRoman Abramovich is working to connect a trio of townhouses worth $78 million. Google Street View/Screenshot In late 2016, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich got approval to connect three townhouses on the Upper East Side, according to 6sqft. He purchased the buildings in 2015 for a reported $78 million .\nThe facades will be preserved, and the center house will become the mansion's main entrance after construction is complete. The interiors will be completely renovated, and the backyard will feature a private garden.\nA pair of limestone townhouses is listed for $75 million. Google Street View/Screenshot Owned by the billionaire Safra family, the two limestone townhouses above were listed for sale in 2015 as a trio with the building on the far right. The asking price was $120 million, but in 2016, the owners asked $75 million for just the pair, which sold in early 2017 and will likely be combined, according to Curbed. \nA total of 25,641 square feet , the soon-to-be Frankenmansion would feature 18 bedrooms.\nMusician Michael Feinstein has a $17.9 million brownstone duo. Google Street View/Screenshot Feinstein bought the townhome on the left for $3 million in 2004, according to The New York Times. A year later, the one next door went up for sale for $3.825 million , and Feinstein purchased, gutted, and renovated it to connect the two. \nThe finished product features 18 rooms, twin staircases, seven bathrooms, two powder rooms, eight fireplaces, a 25-foot-wide backyard, and two pagodas, which serve as outdoor living and dining areas. H e put the mansion on the market for $17.9 million in 2013, but later decided to keep it.\nDexter Goei, CEO of the telecoms company Altice, plans to combine these two townhouses in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood. Google Maps In June 2016, Altice CEO Dexter Goei bought two townhouses in Manhattan's Greenwich Village for $31 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThe Real Deal reported in October that converting them into one mega-mansion is expected to cost $1.3 million. The renovation will be led by architecture firm Arcologia. \nArtist Jeff Koons melded these two townhomes east of Central Park. Google Maps Jeff Koons, the artist known for his giant sculptures of balloon animals, purchased the townhomes pictured above for a total of $32 million in 2009, according to Curbed.\nA year later, he applied to NYC's Department of Buildings to combine them into a 21,500-square-foot megamansion, but the request was denied. In 2013, he submitted a revised proposal, and the renovation started soon after.\nLauren Bush purchased a trio of West Village townhomes, combined by previous owner and renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz. Google Maps Lauren Bush, granddaughter of former President George H.W. Bush, bought a trio of townhouses for $28.5 million in 2014, along with her husband David Lauren, the New York Post reported .\nRenowned photographer Annie Leibovitz was the previous owner. She bought the first two townhouses in 2002 for $4.2 million. A year later, she purchased the neighboring one on the corner for $1.9 million, and combined the three.\nTogether, the compound stretches 10,200 square feet and features seven bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, 13 fireplaces, and a private gated garden.\nSEE ALSO: 7 billion-dollar mega-projects that will transform New York City by 2035 More: Features BI Innovation New York City Architecture Real Estate", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:25:22.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
