IGP-Idris \nHe said a Bill for the establishment of the Fund had been with the National Assembly for several years but regretted that it remained unpassed. \nThe IGP said: “The Nigeria Police as an organisation is faced with many challenges. \n“I can say that the greatest challenge if funding. The organisation is poorly funded and that is why we are seeking the establishment of the Police Trust Fund. \n“A bill for the establishment has been sent to the National Assembly many years ago, unfortunately nothing much has been done on it. \n“We believe that with the establishment of that Trust Fund all tiers of government will contribute to the funding of the police. \n“Both federal, state and local government areas will contribute as a first line charge. Even the private sector operators will also contribute and by so doing, we will enough resources to adequately equip the police to discharge their reposibilities.” \nMr. Idris also appealed to Nigerians to join hands with the police to make the nation safe for all members of the public.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:28:36.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
