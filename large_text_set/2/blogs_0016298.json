Jo-Ann Petinglay, spokesperson for the Western Mindanao Command, confirmed the incident, saying fishermen spotted the Giang Hai drifting near Turtle Island at around 8 a.m. yesterday. \nPetinglay said members of the Marine Battalion Landing Team 8 responded to the scene and rescued 10 Vietnamese sailors.   \nThe body of the fatality was recovered from the vessel. \nFishing vessels towed the Giang Hai to Taganak. \nPetinglay said government security forces in Tawi-Tawi and Sulu were ordered to be on the lookout for the kidnappers. \nPCG officer-in-charge Commodore Joel Garcia said a notice to mariners would be issued to ships passing in the area. \nThe PCG launched a pursuit operation against the pirates. \nPetinglay said they could not yet ascertain whether the Abu Sayyaf was behind the attack. \nThe incident brings to 12 the number of Vietnamese kidnapped in Philippine waters. \nIn November, the bandit group seized six Vietnamese sailors near Basilan.
