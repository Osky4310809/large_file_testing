Starting in April, the brewpub will collaborate with another South Loop business, Chef Luciano, the Italian restaurant that’s been around since 1982. Together, they’ll launch the Baderbräu Kitchen , offering patrons a menu that complements the brewery’s beer. The menu will feature small plates and entrees including beer-battered shrimp made with Baderbräu’s flagship Czech-style pilsner, according to a brewery spokeswoman. The Tribune just last week named the beer among the 15 most-important beers in Chicago. In an act of synergy, Chef Luciano is serving up the shrimp in honor of Catholic Lent. This way eager eaters can get a preview of the forthcoming menu. Baderbraü opened in 2015, overlooking the south side of the Stevenson Expressway, just west of Lake Shore Drive near McCormick Place. Despite being open for less than two years, the beer’s been around for 29 years. The brewery went bankrupt in 1996, and after Goose Island Brewing Co. acquired the brand and it disappeared for a spell, the current owners took over, bringing back the beer from the ashes. That explains the brewery using the mythological Phoenix as its symbol.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:58:27.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
