A small team,” he is quoted as having said by Marca . \n“I believe in the contracts that people sign, and that goes for Diego Simeone and Griezmann.” \nMeanwhile, he has retracted his recent statements on Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero – but only to an extent. \nThe Argentine left Atleti for the Premier League club back in 2011, although has hinted that he could leave the Etihad Stadium after being dropped to the bench for the club's last two matches. \nCerezo labelled Aguero \"stupid\" for quitting the Liga side, but has now moved to clarify his comments. He explained: \"I said on the radio that Aguero was a fool, but he's not a fool. \n\"He is one of the best players in the history of football, and I said he was stupid for leaving Atletico. \n\"He's a great player and a good friend, I wish him all the luck of the world at Manchester City.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:13:39.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
