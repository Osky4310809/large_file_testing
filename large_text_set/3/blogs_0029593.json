The FC crew discuss how Seamus Coleman, Harry Kane and Adam Lallana's injuries will affect their respective clubs. \nEverton will be without double leg-break victim Seamus Coleman for the foreseeable future, while Tottenham wait nervously on news of Harry Kane's return from his second ankle injury of the season. \nBoth clubs have lost vital players at a crucial part of the season. Each of the Premier League's 20 clubs have someone they probably cannot do without if objectives for the season are to be met. \nHere's the pivotal player for each Premier League team ... \nCHELSEA: N'Golo Kante \nWhile David Luiz is crucial to Antonio Conte's three-man defence and Eden Hazard is their creative director, Kante's box-to-box energy is the driving force behind the league leaders' relentless push for the title, which would be his second in succession. \nTOTTENHAM: Harry Kane \nSpurs' resolve will be sorely tested as Kane is nursed back to health, the hope being he returns late next month. When he injured the same ankle in September, Spurs won the first four matches of 10, but found no wins in the next six. Harry Kane's injury has come at the worst possible time for Tottenham. \nMAN CITY: Raheem Sterling \nPep Guardiola's frequent reshaping of his team means nobody is truly indispensable, with Sergio Aguero in particular given that message. Sterling, though, has been a model of consistency from the flanks. \nLIVERPOOL: Adam Lallana \nThe sight of Lallana limping down the Wembley tunnel with a thigh injury was a sore one for Liverpool fans. The playmaker could miss five vital matches in their push for a top-four place. \nMAN UNITED: Zlatan Ibrahimovic \nHis 26 goals so far this season tell the story, when Juan Mata, on 10, is the next best in a lengthy campaign fought on four fronts. The Swede misses plenty of chances, but United are over-reliant on his goals. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been an integral part of Jose Mourinho's Manchester United this term. \nARSENAL: Laurent Koscielny \nThe statistics of Koscielny's contribution to that 10-2 aggregate Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich are that his team were winning 2-1 on aggregate while he was on the field. Shame about the rest of the tie. And the season. \nEVERTON: Idrissa Gueye \nColeman's dreadful injury and long layoff might prove costly to Ronald Koeman's Everton, but the loss of midfield engine Gueye, a gem of a signing from relegated Aston Villa, would probably be more harmful. \nWEST BROM: Jonny Evans \nAt the Hawthorns, fans will tell you that Evans, playing in defence or midfield, is the classiest performer to grace the club since the late-1970s heyday of Bryan Robson and Cyrille Regis. Jonny Evans is flourishing at West Brom. \nSTOKE: Bruno Martins Indi \nMark Hughes' team are inconsistent, wildly so at times, but when they click, the Dutchman's powerful performances in central defence have stood out. His club hope to make his loan from Porto a permanent move. \nSOUTHAMPTON: Oriol Romeu \nSaints have lost Virgil van Dijk to injury and his future on the south coast is far from certain as the likes of Chelsea continue to be keen on him. Anchor midfielder Romeu, once of Chelsea himself, has become his team's key man. \nBOURNEMOUTH: Harry Arter \nMidfielder Arter is not shy of a tackle or two, judging by a count of nine yellow cards this season, but his dogged approach and considerable class on the ball have helped make Bournemouth a tougher proposition this season. \nWEST HAM: Michail Antonio \nEven before Dimitri Payet departed in fractious style to Marseille, Antonio was carrying West Ham. His nine goals -- scored from full-back, the wing and as a False No.9 -- have helped avert what might have been a crisis at the London Stadium Michail Antonio has emerged as a key component in Slaven Bilic's West Ham team. \nBURNLEY: Michael Keane \nA bid of £15 million from Leicester for Keane was rejected last summer, and it has made sound football and economic sense, since Burnley look nailed on for safety. Two assured defensive performances for England this month have suggested he is worth far more. \nWATFORD: Troy Deeney \nDeeney fulfils the role of inspirational leader and goalscorer for Watford. His five goals in his team's last seven matches have pulled them clear of looming relegation trouble. \nLEICESTER: Jamie Vardy \nKante's departure to Chelsea is the most widely voiced theory on the champions' slump, but it also coincided with Vardy's loss of form. Their recent revival fired as he snarled back into gear and started scoring goals once more. Leicester have crept away from trouble in the Premier League, boosted by Jamie Vardy's upturn in form. \nCRYSTAL PALACE: Wilfried Zaha \nThe past week has seen questions raised over how England allowed Zaha to switch to Ivory Coast. Manager Sam Allardyce has described Zaha as a \"genius\", and he can inspire Palace's climb to safety. \nSWANSEA: Gylfi Sigurdsson \nWith Sigurdsson and striker Fernando Llorente in their squad, Swansea had the capability of reverting their desperate form under Bob Bradley. New manager Paul Clement has returned the Icelandic playmaker to the fore. \nHULL CITY: Oumar Niasse \nSuch has been the flux of Hull's season, with new manager Marco Silva overhauling the squad in January, an on-loan Everton outcast holds the key to survival. Niasse's two goals in a 2-1 defeat of Swansea on March 11 has kept the Tigers' hopes alive. \nMIDDLESBROUGH: Ben Gibson \nIf Middlesbrough go down, as is likely, they do so with a reputation for at least defending well. Gibson has been at the fulcrum and will almost certainly be playing Premier League football next season. \nSUNDERLAND: Jermain Defoe \nHis 14 goals have given his club a sliver of a chance of escaping the drop, and he is an England goalscorer once more. Stopping Defoe's return to West Ham in January was probably David Moyes' best move of the season. \nJohn Brewin is a staff writer for ESPN FC. Follow him on Twitter @JohnBrewinESPN.
