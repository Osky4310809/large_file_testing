It’s unfortunate, really, particularly considering people probably had to start getting “glam” at like 10 a.m., which seems rude. But it’s good for us, because it gives us so many more outfits to see! Join me with this constantly updated, comprehensive look at the LOOKS. Advertisement \nAs ever, musicians ideally care less about looking glammy and more about pushing the envelope, although we’ve been seeing that less frequently. Still, you’ve got to give props to the ingenuity of Girl Crush , who brought her own ball pit to this jawn. My big question, though, is how she’s going to sit down? \nChinese singer Jane Zhang ’s feathered gown is beautiful and delicate, while the legend Judy Collins sparked the fire tonight. Myá , who is also a fashion model and works like one (god bless), looks great in that red business suit, though the fit looks a little off from this angle. \nAnita Bias , Amber Strother and Paris Strother of the wonderful R&B trio KING also injected their creativity into their kimono-inspired gowns. Kah-lo and Riton , aside from recording a jam , do bring the essence of the club to the carpet; note Kah-lo’s heels match Riton’s jacket, a lovely detail. And Diplo ’s best look are his babies, Lazer and Locket Pence , who already know from mean-mugging. \nI like that Cashmere Cat and Benny Blanco are repping for music with integrity on the carpet, in the form of Cashmere’s Fade to Mind cap, plus Blanco’s suit is to die for. Erika Jayne , an apparent Real Housewife and “pop singer,” is actually working this sparkly/shiny party dress, though the shoe hue is off. Jill Scott is giving us houndstooth optical illusions, and Steve Aoki looks subdued for the occasion. \nJoy Huerta , of Latin Grammy winners Jesse & Joy, looks breezy and lovely in her rose print; another great graphic print is on Kyle Dixon who, with Michael Stein , makes up S U R V I V E aka the Stranger Things musician guys. Lalah Hathaway is a little too Little Mermaid in that jawn though I respect it, while Lea Michele is stunning in a Roberto Cavalli two-piece. \nRaka Rich and Raka Dun , who make up my homies Los Rakas , always look EXTREMELY on point; I’m glad that Parkwood Entertainment’s Sophie Beem also picked up some style tips from her boss Beyoncé; Tanvi Shah , the first Indian woman to ever win a Grammy, looks lovely and simple in a Marilyn style glam, while Tory Lanez ’s silvery tux jacket is slick and perfect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:18:44.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
