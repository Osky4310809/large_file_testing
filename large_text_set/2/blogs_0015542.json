During a rally in Florida on Saturday, President Trump fear-mongered about immigrants by inventing a Friday night incident in Sweden that never actually occurred  — the second time in less than a month his administration made up a terror incident .\n“Look at what happened last night in Sweden!” Trump told his audience. “Sweden! Who would believe this, Sweden?”\nOf course, we know now that nothing really happened in Sweden on Friday. And on Sunday, Trump clarified that his comment was actually in reference to a Friday night Fox News segment featuring Tucker Carlson’s interview with Fox personality and filmmaker Ami Horowitz — a documentarian whose most recent work looks at refugee crimes in Sweden — not an actual incident of any sort:\nMy statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants &amp; Sweden.\n —  @realDonaldTrump \nTrump, who has made live-tweeting TV news a pastime of his since taking office, was back at it on Monday. Three days after declaring the news media “the enemy of the American People,” Trump posted a tweet blasting the media for its coverage of his Sweden comment.\nGive the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!\n —  @realDonaldTrump \nIt quickly emerged that Trump’s tweet was inspired by Fox News’ coverage yet again.\nDuring a segment that aired about an hour before Trump’s tweet was posted, Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy said the “mainstream media went crazy about” Trump’s Sweden comment. “They missed the point — there’s trouble in Sweden.”\nFox's framing this morning: \"Trump may have been unclear, but Sweden experiencing a migrant crime wave\" https://t.co/5614ZAIlkC \n —  @brianstelter \nDoocy’s assertion was echoed by Tucker Carlson.\n“Europe has tried really, really hard… and it hasn’t worked very well. At all,” Tucker said. “And it’s in the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much more threatening.”\nWatch:\nhttps://medium.com/media/9372f09e3519e7b009805a49cb39ba93/href In fact, crime rates in Sweden have remained flat from 2005 to 2014 — a period of time during which the country opened its doors to refugees. And since Carlson’s interview with Horowitz aired, two Swedish policemen featured in Horowitz’s documentary told the European press their comments were selectively edited and taken out of context in his film.\n“We don’t stand behind what he says,” one of the policemen said of Horowitz. “He is a madman.”\nTrump lifts Fox News’ framing to recklessly attack immigrants was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:47:22.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
