Back in Week 6, the Dolphins beat the Steelers 30-15 in front of their home crowd in Miami thanks to a stellar performance from running back Jay Ajayi and an injury to Steelers’ quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. \nAjayi rushed for 204 yards on 25 carries in the game, which was the spark the then 1-4 Dolphins needed to turn their season around. They went on a six-game winning streak that put them into the playoffs from there, and won nine of their final 11 games to set up this rematch in Pittsburgh. \nThe game kicks off at 1:00 p.m. ET and can be seen exclusively on CBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:13:15.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
