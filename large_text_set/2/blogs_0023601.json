By contrast, the two plans, respectively, would deliver an extra $212,000 and $215,000 in after-tax income to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. No More 'Head of Household' \nSome of the most vulnerable Americans would actually be worse off under Trump's plan, Williams said. \n\"He would actually raise taxes on a lot of single parents and larger families [by] getting rid of head of household filing status,\" he said. \"Most people would have to file as single and most would be worse off.\" \nSome economists say middle class Americans will see a bigger benefit from tax cuts on businesses, which proponents say could boost the fortunes of workers by encouraging investment and increasing business activity. \nThe big effect for the median household will not come through effects in the personal tax rate,\" Hufbauer said. \"It will come through cuts in the business tax rates, which will spark investments in the U.S.\" \nNot everyone is sold on the idea that lower corporate taxes ultimate benefit the middle-class taxpayers Trump courted on the campaign trail, though. \n\"The rhetoric around this is that corporations will invest and create jobs, but… it's not extensive tax burdens that's holding back corporate investment,\" Steinbaum said. \"There's just no documented evidence for that stimulative effect of a corporate tax cut.\" Martha C.
