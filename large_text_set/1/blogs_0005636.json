Of course it will be through the family's famed Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality TV show. In the promo for the upcoming season, the 36-year-old mogul opens up to sisters Khloe and Kourtney about the experience stating, \"They're going to shoot me in the back. There's no way out. It makes me so upset to think about it. \nKim's emotional reaction to the news of husband Kanye West's hospitalization in November is also shown. The rapper was admitted to UCLA Medical Center in November for sleep deprivation and exhaustion after canceling his Saint Pablo tour. \"Don't scare me, please. What's going on?\" Kim says, crying over the phone. She later explains, \"I think he really needs me, and I have to get home.\"\nfamily pic.twitter.com/C160vg1Mcn \nâ€” Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 3, 2017 \n\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T09:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T05:01:37.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
