Evidently, winning the Maryland   A Conference swimming title is one that almost always is. \nLoyola Blakefield won six of 11 events to outlast second-place McDonogh and win the title. It was Loyola's 20th win in the past 21 years, with the only blemish coming in 2012, when McDonogh won. \n\"This is a measure of all the hard work the boys put in, and how passionate they are about swimming,\" Loyola coach Matt McDonough said. \"We lost two senior captains last year, and I didn't know how good we'd be, but they really did some special things this year and surprised me.\" \nMcDonough said he saw the Dons develop into a more complete team as the season went on. \n\"It took a while to get to know who we were, but you could see it coming together. It all worked out in the end,\" McDonough said. \nOne of the best races of the night was the 200-yard individual medley, where Calvert Hall's Josh Walker won with a time of 1:52.15. For Walker, who broke the school record by .01 of a second Friday night in the preliminaries, the victory bested that time by almost two full seconds. The time also makes him eligible for All-American consideration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:53:44.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
