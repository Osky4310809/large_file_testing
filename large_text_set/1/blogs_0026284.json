They are also safely through to the fifth round of the FA Cup and have a last-32 showdown with Saint-Etienne approaching in the Europa League. \nCup commitments are complementing their pursuit of a top-four finish in the Premier League, with just four points separating them from the Champions League spots at present. \nLingard admits that things could not be going much better, with belief restored to the Old Trafford ranks under Mourinho. \nMan Utd make Griezmann top target \nHe told Sky Sports : \"We're still in four competitions so everybody is going to play. \n\"I know all competitions are still tight. With that, we'll take every game as it comes and we're still in a good line for the three competitions. \n\"The squad we've got at the moment, the confidence and the run we're on, nobody can beat us - and it's definitely possible [to go all the way in the three cup competitions].\" \nLingard has offered three goals to the United cause in 21 appearances this season, with the 24-year-old England international delighted to be part of a forward-thinking squad. \nHe added: \"The lads and everyone are very confident at the moment. Everyone is on a roll at the moment. \nMata: I couldn't be more motivated \n\"It's the team spirit, winning matches, there's a real togetherness in the squad. We've really gelled in the last three or four months. \n\"Everyone speaks to everyone, we've really come together and [are] starting to show it on the field too.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T15:15:02.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
