So I keep quiet and skirt the median. To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides,” O’Grady wrote in an old Facebook post.

And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsements for what I believe to be a disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her,” she added. \nAfter O’Grady’s statements began to make national headlines, the Secret Service quickly place her on administrative leave. At the time, it was unknown whether she would be fired for her comments. \nThe Washington Examiner reported that top officials at the Secret Service may be trying to shield O’Grady and place her in another government job, possibly at the Department of Homeland Security.   \nHowever, agents within the service are still worried she will be allowed to serve out her time until she can retire with a pension, as the agency has done with other controversial officials in the past. \nO’Grady was removed from a retired Secret Service member association—The Association of Former Agents U.S. Secret Service. \nHer former job was also placed on a list of agency openings. \nO’Grady claims her opinions of the president wouldn’t have impacted her ability to execute her duties.
