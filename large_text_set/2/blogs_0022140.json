Ocho and Joe La Puma hit up Miami’s KITH store where the former discussed being fined by the NFL for his past taste in cleats, which he used to personalize despite regulation. The former football player also illuminated why he felt he wouldn’t survive in the current NFL, and complimented Odell Beckham Junior on his singular style.\nLastly, Ocho also revealed that he used to work at McDonalds in high school, a job he picked up partly to help pay for his footwear habit, which, by his accounts was quite expensive even back then.\nWhat did we learn? Well, the need to have the newest pair of Air Jordan’s has been making kids go broke for longer than we thought, apparently.\nPress play to enjoy and check out the last installment of the series here . \n\n \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:39:20.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
