Starbucks Roastery locations are designed for a premium coffee experience. The coffee chain also unveiled the building that will house the Roastery, a former post office building, before it’s remodeled. This is also the first Starbucks location in Italy.

This investment includes a plan to open between 20 and 30 Roastery locations around the world. Starbucks had opened its first Roastery in Seattle in 2014, a venture that the coffee giant referred to as the most successful location-opening move in the company’s history. In addition to the planned location in Milan, SBUX plans to open more of this locations in Shanghai, China, in 2017 and in New York and Tokyo in 2018. \nGiven there’s an ingrained coffee culture in Italy, SBUX plans to design the new location such that the local Milanese can feel comfortable with Starbucks. In addition, once the former post office location opens, Starbucks’ Italian business partner and licensee Percassi will start opening a few SBUX locations in Milan. Starbucks had announced a partnership with Percassi in February 2016. An Opportunity To Improve Comps \nDuring its fiscal year 2017 earnings call on Jan. 26, CEO Howard Schultz said that the Seattle Roastery is producing company-leading comparable store sales growth. The location delivered an 18 percent comps growth in Starbucks’ first quarter, with the preceding quarter generating a 24 percent comps growth. \nSchultz attributed the impressive sales growth at the Seattle Roastery to the average ticket at the location being roughly four times larger than the average ticket at its usual stores. Therefore, as Starbucks looks to bring sales growth back to its EMEA reporting segment , the new Milan Roastery announcement offers hope for the segment. The coffee chain has reported comps decline in the segment in the last two quarters.
