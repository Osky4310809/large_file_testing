Most Popular By Raakhee Mirchandani Feb 23, 2017 Like so many of us, my American story is an immigrant one. My dad, came to this country eager to try his luck; my mom came as a brand new bride, unsure of a new land where she neither looked nor sounded like her neighbors. Their story has a happy ending: from Bombay to the 'burbs of New Jersey, kids, houses, Sunday temple trips followed by pizza nights. I'm textbook New Jersey: brassy, ballsy, and all about that Boss. But among the many titles I wear proudly—mother, editor, pediatric cancer crusader, friend, and Jersey girl—first-generation American tops that list. It speaks to the idea that I get to be American because my parents took a chance, risking it all to build something better. It tells you that they were tough enough to leave all they knew to start again. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It's important, in between her toddler yoga lessons and Thursday sushi nights, that Satya, my 3-year-old sassbucket of a daughter, knows her second-generation privilege was built directly on her grandparents' immigrant dreams. America has given my parents and in-laws, my husband and myself, the opportunity to thrive. So it matters that she's aware, right from the beginning, that Americans come in different colors and faiths, with different accents and backstories. We wear turbans and hijabs, yarmulkes and baseball hats. And that this America is as much hers as it is it the kids who are fleeing Syria for a second chance. Most Popular These books have helped my husband and I open up important conversations with her about kids *just* like her, all around the world, who don't have things as easy as she does. They've let us talk about what makes us lucky to live in America and what we can do to lend a hand, quite literally, to help lift a neighbor or friend up. And while I started reading them to Satya to awaken compassion for immigrants and refugees, these books reminded me to open my own eyes as well. Amazon Paddington by Michael Bond Everyone's favorite British bear has humble immigrant roots. This marmalade-loving little guy left Peru with nothing but a suitcase, a few jars of the sticky sweet stuff, and a label that said: \"Please look after this bear.\" Paddington, named after the London train station that Mr. and Mrs. Brown found him in, was lucky enough to meet a family who took him home and made him their own, even if he had some trouble adjusting to life in England. Little kids will love the adventure and the furry sweetness, while parents can use Paddington as a first conversation about leaving home and second chances in a new place. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The Name Jar by Yanksook Choi What's in a name? Confusion, insecurity, and comfort if you're little Unhei (pronounced YOOH-HYE), who recently moved from Korea to America. In Korea, everyone knew how to say her name―but at her new school, particularly after some school bus teasing, Unhei seems to be in the market for a new one. That's until a classmate empowers her to realize that she is different and different is just fine. The multiculturalism is baked into even the illustrations; when Unhei goes grocery shopping, she passes Fadil's Falafel, Tony's Pizza, and Dot's Deli. People by Peter Spier This masterfully illustrated book starts off with how we are similar, but also celebrates the many ways we're different: shades, sizes, eye shape, and hair. The drawings are exceptional, ranging from an all American dad in a plaid shirt to an Eskimo family to tribal villagers to friends in burkas and baseball caps. The last page says it all, in perfect kidspeak: \"It is very strange: Some people even hate other people because they are unlike themselves. Because they are different. They forget that they too would seem different if they could only see themselves through other people's eyes. But imagine how dreadfully dull this world of ours would be if everybody looked, thought, ate, dressed, and acted the same.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Amazon Most Popular Lost and Found Cat: The True Story of Kunkush's Incredible Journey by Doug Kuntz and Amy Shrodes We meet Rihab, Hakam, Maab, Ahab, Ansab, and their mama Sura as they are heading out of Mosul in a car driven by smugglers. The father has just died. The family could only take what they could carry―the secret escape mission from Iraq to Europe requires hiking, climbing, a bus, a car, and a rubber raft. But hidden in a small basket, quiet as can be, is Kunkush, the family's beloved cat. Their furry friend makes the trek with them, including hours on the raft to Greece. So when the fuzzy feline gets lost on the island of Lesbos and they are forced to continue on without him, the end of their arduous journey is tinged with sadness. This true story has a happy ending but its not without bittersweet notes, like this line about Kunkush's experience in Greece: \"The local cats seemed to know he was a stranger. They hissed and spat and chased him away.\" Added bonus? The sale of the book benefits Doctors Without Borders. The Journey by Francesca Sanna Inspired by many refugee tales, Sanna weaves together a story that is much heavier than the beautifully illustrated cover implies. The countries in the tale are not named, neither are the characters. But when war comes, represented by a menacing black hand that covers the bucolic beach scene and knocks over buildings, it feels terrifying. Soon after, a dad dies―and glasses and shoes on a black page illustrate the loss with only what's left. The images are powerful, often both scary and sad: a monster-like guard shoos a family away from a border wall. The tale is likely too intense for the preschool set, but it will affect older kids and parents, alike. On one page a mother cradles her sleeping children, tears quietly streaming down her face so as not to wake her kids. There's no happy ending or sweet furry animal, but there is hope at the end that the family will find a new home, a place to start a new story.

In this book, we meet a Kenyan blacksmith, a rock band on a tour bus, and a racoon who calls a tree home. The idea here is simple: homes, like people, come in lots of different shapes and sizes. This book is a natural way to open up a conversation about what makes something a home, or, what happens when you are forced to leave a home and the rebuilding that follows. Amazon I'm New Here by Anne Sibley O'Brien It's their first day of school and Maria, Jin, and Fatimah―from Guatemala, Korea, and Somalia, respectively―have only recently moved to America. Maria is having trouble with the language. Jim knows how to read and write in Korean, but not in English. When Fatimah draws a picture of her family, she and her mother are wearing hijabs, and she feels different. From the classroom to the playground, our three friends slowly make new friends, connecting over the things they have in common like the love of drawing or playing soccer. The story is simple and relatable to kids and an easy way to encourage them to engage a new friend who may not speak the same language.

It's tough on Saya and her father, who visit Mama in jail, while also writing to their congresspeople, local news reporters, and lawyers for assistance. The story feels particularly poignant at the moment, but the author writes from experience; she and her brother lived in Haiti with her aunt while her parents lived in America. Unlike so many kids like her, Saya gets a happy ending. Parents will appreciate the Haitian vocabulary sprinkled throughout the text, Saya's chutzpah, and Leslie Staub's exquisite illustrations. (For what it's worth, my 3-year-old daughter wasn't as alarmed by the jailed mother as she was confused by the concept of a cassette tape and tape player. SMH.) Amazon My Two Blankets by Irena Kobold & Freya Blackwood Cartwheel―it's a cute nickname her Auntie gave her―leaves her village for life in a foreign city. She doesn't speak the language, she doesn't look like everyone around her, and she feels cold and alone. But a chance encounter at a park with a new friend leaves her hopeful. Together the two girls―one porcelain-skinned and blond, the other caramel with a headscarf―forge a friendship, despite the language barrier by swinging on swings, learning new words, and making the effort to connect.

The ending features a pop-up suitcase, where little readers are encouraged to think about what they would bring with them if they had to pick up and move. An excellent conversation-starter that encourages interactivity and imagination. Amazon Oskar and the Eight Blessings by Richard Simon and Tanya Simon It's Kristallnacht and Oskar's parents put him on a boat to New York City with nothing but an address and a photo of \"Aunt Esther,\" a woman he had never met. The first page is also the first and last time we meet Oskar's parents―their fates aren't discussed―and he holds close the last thing his father said to him: \"Oskar, even in bad times, people can be good. You have to look for the blessings.\" And that's exactly what he does when he gets to New York. On Christmas Eve and the 7th day of Hanukkah, where the blessings come in the form of a Superman comic book, red gloves for his cold hands, a loaf of bread from a kind lady, and an impromptu call-and-response whistling session with a stranger. The Night of Broken Glass appears once in the beginning and never again, so parents who aren't ready for that conversation could work around it. But Oskar's tale of hope and courage, and his ability to see kindness despite his sadness, is a hard one to resist.
