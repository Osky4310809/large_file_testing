We have worked really hard to lift this league up and I am very hurt to see all these happenings,” Ramiz said. \nThe Pakistan Cricket Board on Friday announced that two players Khalid Latif and Sharjeel Khan were provisionally suspended and an inquiry was initiated against them for their alleged links with an international syndicate trying to corrupt Pakistan Super League. \nAlthough, the PCB didn’t elaborate further on the events, but sources have confirmed that players were seen connecting with suspected bookies on the day when PSL’s second edition was formally kicked-off in Dubai, following the development both were sent back to home. \nRamiz, who’s also a brand ambassador of Pakistan Super League, question the upbringing and teaching of cricketers who’re attempting to corrupt an event of cricket. \n“I fail to understand that why can one even think about such activities, I have no option but to believe that it has to do with their upbringing because they haven’t learnt anything and haven’t improved their horizon even after witnessing and experiencing the world,” he said. \n“Sometimes players start considering themselves larger than the life and in such scenario they just get on wrong path… this is mostly because they were not properly taught while brought up on how to remain honest,”commented Raja while expressing his frustration on the development. \nThe former captain further demanded that both the players, if found guilty, should be banned forever and shouldn’t be pardoned for the sin they committed. Raja said that PCB must impose a “zero appearance” policy on such cricketers and they should never be allowed to comeback. \n“I would recommend a total ban on them if they’re proven guilty, they have nothing to do with cricket, they don’t want to learn and every time hang our head in shame. \nYesterday they were standing for Pakistan anthem, taking oath of remaining honest and the next day they were caught… this is not acceptable. We must not forgive such people, they don’t deserve being pardoned,” Raja said. \nRamiz, however, praised the Pakistan Cricket Board for the prompt and transparent approach in dealing with the case involving Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif. \n“The good point there was that PCB reacted promptly and didn’t hide anything, kept everything transparent to disengage those players from everything,” he concluded. \nIf found guilty, the players should be banned indefinitely from international cricket, says Ramiz Raja #PSL2017 Posted by Geo News English on Friday, February 10, 2017 0 0 Ramiz Raja recommends total ban on players if found guilty was posted in sports of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on February 11, 2017 and was last updated on February 11, 2017.
