But it reflected the widening effort to try to piece together a fuller portrait of the 52-year-old suspect — from his upbringing around England, to his years of small-time crime and eventually his evolution as Khalid Masood, the name he adopted along with other aliases.\nMark Rowley, the acting deputy police commissioner, said that two people have been arrested in the West Midlands and the northwest of England. That brought the number of people in custody to nine in connection with Wednesday’s attack, which killed three pedestrians and a police officer outside Parliament before Masood was shot and killed.\nThe “mainline of our investigation is what led him to be radicalized. Was it through influences in our community? Influences from overseas? Or through online propaganda,” said Rowley at the briefing.\nPolice maintain that they believe Masood — born under the name Adrian Russell Ajao — acted alone, but also said they were conducting a wide probe to see if he had accomplices who supported him.\n“Our determination is to find out if either he acted totally alone, inspired by perhaps terrorist propaganda, or if others had encouraged, supported or directed him,” said Rowley.\n[“I immediately recognized him”: What we know about the London attacker ]\nAs part of their inquiry, the police have seized 2,700 items, including “massive” amounts of computer data.\n“We need to get away from this lone wolf thing,” Chris Phillips, former head of the national counterterrorism security office, told the BBC. “There’s almost always someone else involved.”\nMeanwhile in Belgium, a man who drove a car carrying weapons at high speed in a pedestrian shopping street in Antwerp on Thursday — forcing people to jump out of the way — was charged with terrorism offenses. Federal prosecutors charged Mohamed R., 39, with “attempted murder in a terror context,” according to the Associated Press.\nRowley said that at least 50 people were injured in London attack with 31 requiring medical treatment. Two people are still in critical condition and one has life threatening injuries. London police identified the latest fatality as 75-year-old Leslie Rhodes from south London, who died of injuries late Thursday.\n[ London mayor reassures a city that says it doesn’t need reassurance ]\nDetails were still emerging about Masood, who was born on Christmas Day in 1964 in Kent in southeast England. He later lived in cities including Luton and Birmingham.\nIt was unclear what he did professionally. According to the Sun tabloid , which says it saw a copy of Masood’s resume, he worked as an English teacher in Saudi Arabia and then later back in England.\nFormer neighbors of Masood in Luton told broadcasters that he enjoyed gardening and one thought he stayed at home and looked after his children. He had been investigated by intelligence services previously, but seems to have fallen off the radar.\nIn a statement , Scotland Yard said Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and had not been convicted of any terrorism offenses before he unleashed Wednesday’s bloodshed.\nIn her statement to the House of Commons, the British Prime Minister Theresa May said that he was investigated by security services “some years ago … in relation to concerns about violent extremism.”\nBut she said that he was a “peripheral figure.”\n“The case is historic. He was not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or of the plot. Intensive investigations continue,” she said.\nHis last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife.\nThe Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed that he spent time in jail — not for terrorism offenses — prompting some to question if he could have been radicalized in prison.\nScotland Yard said Masood was “known to police” and had a range of previous convictions for assaults, possession of offensive weapons and public-order offenses.\nAccording to British media reports, on his final night he stayed at a budget hotel in Brighton, a seaside town in the south of England. The Sun said that officers identified the hotel after finding a receipt left in the car that crashed into the railings of the Houses of Parliament.\nA spokesman for the Enterprise rental car company confirmed reports that the Hyundai used in the attack came from one of their offices in Birmingham.\nThe police on Friday issued a public appeal for help. “There might well be people out there who did have concerns about Masood,” said Rowley.\nMurphy reported from Washington.\nRead more:\nFamily of Utah man killed in London “heartbroken”\nBritons are denouncing Donald Trump Jr.’s attack on London’s mayor\nIn the aftermath of London attack, some Brits praise their strict gun laws\nToday’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@BrianFMurphy", "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostworld/", "https://twitter.com/@karlaadam", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3166064/westminster-terrorist-khalid-masood-adrian-russell-ajao/", "http://news.met.police.uk/news/update-westminster-attack-man-believed-responsible-named-230160"], "published": "2017-03-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T16:10:34.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
