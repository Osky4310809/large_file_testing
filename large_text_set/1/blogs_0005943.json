Butler picked up a huge home win on Wednesday night.\nCollege basketball will have a new No. 1 team when the polls come out next week. The Butler Bulldogs knocked off top-ranked Villanova 66-58 at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indiana on Wednesday. This is the third time the No. 1 team has been defeated this season.\nThis is a season-defining win for No. 18 Butler after a loss at St. John’s last week. The Bulldogs experienced some terrifying plane trouble on their way from that game. The plane landed safely and Butler defeated Providence at home two days later.\nKethan Savage led the way for Butler with 13 points. This layup with under one minute left gave the Bulldogs the cushion they needed for the win.\nAndrew Chrabascz added 13 points and Kelan Martin chipped in 12 points for Butler in the win.\nThis was the second win in school history for Butler against a No. 1 team in seven tries, and their first such victory at home. The other win against a top-ranked squad came over Indiana in 2012.\nThe loss snapped Villanova’s 20-game winning streak, and dropped the Wildcats (14-1) from the ranks of the unbeaten, a distinction now known by only two teams this season — Baylor (13-0) and Gonzaga (14-0).\nJalen Brunson was excellent for Villanova in the loss, finishing with 23 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T08:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:39:31.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
