Fans found out the site was planning to back a new season when Netflix listed the new season on its site in January. Of fans, fans have been eager to learn more about the action-packed show, and it looks like their wish has been granted. Over on Netflix, a trailer for The Seven Deadly Sins just dropped. \nThe trailer shows Princess Elizabeth as she recounts the events of the show’s first season. A slew of familiar knights like Meliodas and more are shown going head-to-head against some of their previous villains, but all is still not well in Britannia. The country is still reeling from the knights’ battles last season, and Elizabeth is unsure how her family’s realm will fare as unease settles around the land. \nYou can check out the trailer here on Netflix. \nIf you are unfamiliar with The Seven Deadly Sins , you can read up on its Netflix description below: \n“When a kingdom is taken over by tyrants, the deposed princess begins a quest to find a disbanded group of evil knights to help take back her realm.” \nFor those of you who want to know more about the series, then you can catch-up on it easily. The Seven Deadly Sins tells the historical tale of a group of knights who once looked over the land of Britannia. After being unfairly disbanded, the knights go their separate ways and are presumed dead. But, when a rogue group of Holy Knights overtake the kingdom, Britannia’s princess goes in search of the fabled group. And, with the help of the Seven Deadly Sins, war is waged over the coveted country. \nThe series debuted in October 2012 in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has since sold more than 10 million volumes. A-1 Pictures then adapted the manga into an anime in October 2014. Netflix acquired rights to the show’s English dub, and Crunchyroll releases The Seven Deadly Sins manga simultaneously with its Japanese debut.
