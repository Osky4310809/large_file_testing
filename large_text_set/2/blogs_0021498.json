The money in Australia wasn’t anywhere near $38 million. What do I know? We live in an alternative reality world. I don’t know what the story is. If the $38 million is real, it trumps the Australia deal,” he explained. \nPacquiao on Thursday tweeted that negotiations are underway between him and Khan’s camp for a bout, most likely in Dubai. My team and I are in negotiations with Amir Khan for our next fight. Further announcement coming soon. #TeamPacquiao pic.twitter.com/nW5jpmwVJs \n— Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 23, 2017 Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nThe Filipino icon’s adviser Mike Koncz has been on top of the situation in Dubai while Arum is working on the Australian deal. \nParties in Australia are reportedly offering Pacquiao $5 million to $6 million to take on Horn in Brisbane, an amount that pales largely in comparison to the one dangled in Dubai. \nFor Arum, it’s too good to be true at this point. \n“If it’s real, we will assist putting on the event. But I am not holding my breath, and I’m not making plane reservations,” the veteran promoter added. \nAccording to Arum, Pacquiao’s keenness on fighting Khan in Dubai has knocked Australia and Horn out of the picture. \n“The Australian deal is not going to happen now because Manny is trying to get a fight done in the United Arab Emirates, and the people there favor him fighting Amir Khan,” he also said. \nNevertheless, until everything is set in stone – and the money is shown – Arum remains doubtful. \n“Whether it [Pacquiao-Khan fight in Dubai] will happen or not, I just don’t know, because they have to come up with a large amount of money. Manny seems to believe they will come up with the money,” he continued. \n“I have some reservations whether it will happen or not. If the money comes up, I will aid and abet the fight happening. But right now, I’m not holding my powder. I really don’t know.” – Dino Maragay Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:37:28.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
