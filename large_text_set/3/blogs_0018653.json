Gorsuch’s answer, Franken recalled, was that he tries to stay away from politics. \nThe Minnesota senator went on to bring up his political background with information that the Senate Democrats were quick to tweet out: Take a look at Judge Gorsuch’s resume from 2004. Despite what he has said, he hasn’t really stayed out of politics after all: pic.twitter.com/3Six3kEU8x \n— Senate Democrats (@SenateDems) March 21, 2017 \nThe mention of 1976 there is notable because, as Gorsuch said, that year he was “walking the district with my mom when she was running for state house.” Also, he was 9 years old at the time. \nFranken’s citations of political activity in Gorsuch’s past led him to conclude that his statement that he tries to “avoid” politics isn’t entirely true. \nHe again asked Gorsuch for his thoughts on Garland. \nGorsuch said his belief in staying out of political matters began the moment he became a judge. Franken tried to ask him again, but Gorsuch did not bite. \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T23:23:36.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
