With the demonetisation drive, India went into a financial frenzy. Banks worked overtime to accept and dispense cash, most ATMS remained shut and India went cashless, literally. What also changed was the popularity of digital payments. Before November, digital payments were slowly becoming popular. But post demonetization, they became a necessity as the cash crunch hit the economy. Among other digital payments, the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) also made its mark. Being linked to your actual bank account, UPI enables you to make transactions directly from your bank account without the use of mobile wallets. \nThe UPI platform compares favourable to e-wallets on many parameters. And therefore it’s a welcome sight to see the launch of the government-backed Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app. It is a mobile payment app which aggregates the UPI-based services offered by all banks. Right now, BHIM is available on Android platforms, and has received over 10 million downloads in a short span after its launch. \nHowever, the one area where BHIM didn’t compare favourably with e-wallets was in marketing and promotions. E-wallets became essential not just because of the cash crunch but also because they were offering users discounts, cashback offers and deals. But with the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announcing the plans to have promotional offers on BHIM, this UPI app will be hard to ignore. \nYou may also watch: \nBHIM app referral scheme \nUnder this scheme, a referral code would be provided to you if you are a BHIM app user.
