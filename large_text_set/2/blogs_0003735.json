It’s actually an insult to actual juveniles to say that it’s juvenile. I mean, I don’t know what category to put this in. It’s a disturbing trend that we see from this president… I’m not saying he shouldn’t tweet if he wants to, but there’s a certain amount of decorum that we expect from our president.” \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:14:41.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
