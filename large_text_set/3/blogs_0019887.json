GOVERNOR Ifeanyi Okowa \nIbori, at a function in Oghara, had endorsed Okowa for re-election on the premise that the governor had a lot of ongoing developmental projects that need another four years to complete. He appealed to Urhobos to wait for their turn in 2023. \nOnuesoke, who spoke in Oghara, while responding to questions on the development, said Ibori had not only spoken the mind of the Urhobos, but he had also spoken the interest of the entire people of Delta. \n“The governor and his team are doing well. Like a winning football team, we do not need to change them. Before Ibori’s approval, the people of Delta are quite aware that Okowa had laid a great foundation for the development of the state and four years will not be enough to complete his projects. He will need another four years to do this,” the PDP chieftain said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T09:00:35.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
