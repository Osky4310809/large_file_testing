The man whose name still brings a smile and a warm glow to Arsenal faces. \nThe guy who took laid back to new levels with his flat out celebration at hitting that famous 1971 FA Cup-winning goal, as he waited for his team-mates to haul him from the turf. \nYet the man who was anything but, whenever confronted by anything approaching authority. \nCharlie George. Maverick, causer of mayhem and magician. All in the same body. Getty Images 14 Charlie George was a rebel but a magician at the same time \nFor every flash of genius there was a flash of temper. Like the time he headbutted Kevin Keegan or flicked the Vs at Derby fans after one goal at the Baseball Ground. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Arsenal news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nGeorge was the ultimate local boy made good. The rebel WITH a cause. Yet it’s surprising the lank-haired, skinny striker born a couple of miles from Highbury ever got a chance. \nAs a youngster he was actually expelled from Holloway Comprehensive – where Arsenal keeper Bob Wilson was a teacher – and was never a good follower of orders. \nIndeed he once missed a reserve team game, supposedly ill, only to go and watch the first team in an away game that night. \nBoss Bertie Mee was an old-school, hard-line type who was convinced George was worth the risk. \nEven though he stuck him back in the reserves for three months after a taste of the first team to “avoid all the headlines sending him off the rails.” That worked well! Getty Images George was expelled as a kid from Holloway Comprehensive Getty Images George made his debut for Arsenal in 1968, two years after joining the Gunners Getty Images 14 George spoke to supporters at the Emirates in 2013 \nGeorge’s breakthrough season came in 1969-70, which he ended with 15 goals and a Fairs Cup – now Europa League – winners’ medal. \nThe next campaign ended with that stunning Cup winner against Liverpool , yet in the mists of time it is forgotten that a broken ankle restricted him to 17 league games. \nBut it ended with THAT 20-yard Wembley winner – his defining moment in an Arsenal shirt – as his next campaign was more about ill discipline and run-ins than goals and glory. Getty Images George won the equivalent of the Europa League in his breakthrough season Getty Images George scored in the fourth, fifth and sixth round before netting in the final Getty Images 14 Arsenal were drawing 1-1 with Liverpool before he scored an extra time winner \nHis relationship with Mee sunk to such depths he was transfer listed in the summer of 1972 over a contract row and stuck back in the reserves. \nHe returned, after a simmering truce, a month into the campaign, but injuries and form struggles meant he never really came close to his earlier heights. \nAnd in 1975 he left the club he had first watched from the terraces as a five-year-old to join Derby for £90,000 – not before horrifying Gunners fans by flirting with a move to Spurs. \nThe prospect of seeing him in a Tottenham shirt was too appalling for words for supporters he’d share a pint with in the boozer after matches. Many of whom knew him personally.

After being shunted to the left wing and then taken off, he famously told the national boss to “go f*** himself.” \nEven though Revie left soon after, George was now also on the international black list.
