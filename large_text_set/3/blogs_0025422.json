H - ASAP Chase Magnett Start Slideshow Slide of \nThe unfortunate side effect of living in a world with so much great entertainment is that it’s not difficult to let something truly spectacular pass beneath your radar. \nWe’re already in the midst of a spectacular year for movies and each month of 2017 has delivered some spectacular new comics. So it’s easy to think that you’d be better off ignoring a series that is already 12 issues into its run and halfway over. However, you’d be wrong in thinking that. \nDept. H , the underwater mystery crafted by Matt and Sharlene Kindt, has reach the end of its second arc and is preparing to go on hiatus before it being the second half of its story. Just like Kindt’s previous Dark Horse title Mind MGMT , it’s a carefully crafted story where each chapter delivers new revelations in issues designed by Kindt from cover to cover. The instinct for many comics readers might be to trade wait or allow the series to finish before checking it out, but that’s a misgiving notion. \nThis is why you need to dive into Dept. H as soon as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:57:32.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
