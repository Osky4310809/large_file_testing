A powerful line of thunderstorms, with the potential to unleash damaging winds, is forecast to blast through the D.C. area this afternoon between about 1 and 4 p.m.\nIf the squall line reaches its full potential, damaging winds could be widespread. However, because sunshine — which acts as fuel for the storms — may be limited, the storms may be fairly ordinary or even tame in some areas, especially north of the District.\nThe National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm watch , which means conditions are favorable for severe storm development, but not a guarantee. Stay alert.\nTiming : 1 p.m. through 4 p.m., but storms will only last 30-45 minutes in any particular area.\nCoverage: Around 70 percent should experience storminess.\nHazards: Areas of damaging winds, lightning and heavy rain are likely. Small hail is possible. Isolated large hail and a weak tornado or two cannot be ruled out.\nStorm motion: West to east\nNote: A second broken line of showers and maybe thunderstorms is 10 p.m. and midnight, but probably will not be severe.\nAs the line moves through, if severe thunderstorms warnings are issued, seek shelter in a strong building and stay off the roads if possible. Bring inside outdoor furniture or any item that could become a dangerous projectile.\nScattered power outages are possible, so charge portable devices.\n region in an enhanced risk zone for severe thunderstorms. This is level three on its 1 to 5 scale.\nNotably, it forecasts a 45 percent likelihood of damaging winds within 25 miles of a given point in our region, which is a very high number. During our typical severe thunderstorm threats, that likelihood is placed at 15 percent.\nLikelihood of damaging winds within 25 miles of a point on Wednesday. (National Weather Service) Discussion\nThe storm system predicted to generate these dangerous storm is the same one which resulted in more than 500 reports of severe weather Tuesday in the Heartland . These reports included 24 tornadoes, 243 incidents of damaging winds, and 250 instances of large hail.\nThe storms were responsible for three deaths, CNN reported .\nThe storms are forming ahead of a powerful cold front, stretching from the Great Lakes to the Deep South. On Wednesday morning, severe storms were lined up along the Ohio-West Virginia border southward through Tennessee.\nExtremely powerful high-altitude winds are helping to power and sustain the storms as they march eastward.\nAs the storms cross the mountains, the key uncertainty is how well the storms hold together. On Wednesday morning, a stubborn cloud deck was holding back temperatures in the D.C. area. In the absence of sunshine, the heating required to energize the storms to severe levels may fall short in some areas, especially north of the District.\nRadar simulation between noon and 5 p.m. from HRRR model. However, eroding clouds late Wednesday morning into the afternoon may allow for a period of sunshine and soaring temperatures — which could give storms moving into such an environment the opportunity to erupt and turn dangerous.\nWe will provide updates through the afternoon on this developing situation.", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/01/weather/severe-weather-midwest/index.html", "https://twitter.com/@capitalweather", "https://radar.weather.gov/Conus/centgrtlakes.php", "http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/170228_rpts.html", "https://icons.wxug.com/data/weather-maps/radar/united-states/staunton-virginia-region-current-radar.gif", "http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0056.html"], "published": "2017-03-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T18:02:02.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
