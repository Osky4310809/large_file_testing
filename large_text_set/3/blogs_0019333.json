They will meet two more times, including Thursday night in the nation’s capital. \nIn their only previous matchup with Toronto this season, the Blue Jackets came away with a 5-2 on Feb. 15 in Columbus, putting John Tortorella’s club in position for its first four-game winning streak over the Maple Leafs. \nColumbus is among a handful of teams averaging more than three goals per game. Jenner, Oliver Bjorkstrand, Cam Atkinson and Sam Gagner are tied for the team lead with four goals while Zach Werenski has a team-high seven assists and nine points this month. \nThe Jackets’ defense, led by Bobrovsky, is more impressive. \nBobrovsky is 7-0-0 with a 1.14 goals-against average, a .963 save percentage and three consecutive shutouts in March. He’s stopped 211 of his last 219 shots faced, and needs one win to reach 40 for the first time in his seven NHL seasons. \n“You see it all the time that the teams that win and teams that go far in the playoffs get unbelievable goaltending,” teammate Brandon Dubinsky told the team’s website. “He’s our most important player. He’s going to be leaned on a lot, and if he can stand tall the way he has so far I really like our chances to make a good run.” \nBackup Joonas Korpisalo defeated the Maple Leafs last month, and is 2-0-0 with a 1.00 GAA and a shutout at home. \nWhile Columbus’ playoff spot is secure, the same cannot yet be said for Toronto (33-23-15), which has been to the playoffs once since 2004. \nAfter a 4-2 win over the Boston Bruins on Monday to complete a rare season-series sweep, the Maple Leafs trail the third-place Bruins by one point in the Atlantic Division with a game in hand. \n“We’ve gotten better as the year’s gone on,” Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly said. “When you come down the stretch and you play these important games late in the season you learn a lot. This is where you learn how to win.” \nBut with less than three weeks to play in the regular season, Toronto needs to figure out how to win on the road consistently. The club is 4-7-2 and has failed to win back-to-back games in its last 13 away from home. \n“Where there’s more on the line, they’re more fun to play, they’re more satisfying when you win, and they crush you when you lose,” defenseman Brian Boyle told the Toronto Star. \nBoyle was acquired before the trade deadline to lend an additional veteran presence to a team loaded with rookies. Top overall pick Auston Matthews is second among rookies in goals (32) and points (57) behind Patrik Laine of the Winnipeg Jets. Mitch Marner (56) and William Nylander (52) are third and fourth, respectively, in the rookie scoring race. \nNylander has been the hottest of the three lately with two goals and six assists in an eight-game points streak. \nReceived 03/21/17 09:22 pm ET 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T16:55:49.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
