Then snip off the end or the tip of the wing. Trim any excess skin from the wing, and pat them dry. Add the ketchup, white vinegar, molasses, honey, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, paprika, chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to a medium saucepot set over medium heat; stir to combine. Bring the sauce to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to low to maintain the simmer; cook uncovered for 20 minutes. Add the oil to a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or electric deep fryer , leaving at least 2 inches of space at the top. Heat the oil to 375Â°F. In batches of 3 to 5 chicken wings, carefully fry the wings for 10 to 15 minutes or until they are crisp on the outside. Place on a paper-towel-lined plate to drain off excess oil (and cool slightly) before tossing them in the honey-barbecue sauce. Toss wings in honey-barbecue sauce, and serve immediately.
