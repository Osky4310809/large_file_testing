But there are some that need to stay far, far away from us for good. While it can be stressful to keep up with such fast moving fads that come and go, we feel that a few items just need to be dumped (hopefully for life!) right away. So, in case it's been a while since you did a closet-cleanse, today we're rounding up the five fashion items we're so over, that they will make for a good fire in case you are feeling a little chilly! 1. Flower Crowns \nThey came from the fields of Coachella and while we enjoyed the first two months of having them around, and bought 10 of them in different varieties, after 2 years now, we are DONE. We strongly feel the urge to say that they look hideous and you need to get away from them like you get away from a dead rat. 2. Wedge Boots Or Sneakers \nHonestly, we have no idea where they came from and why people even have them in the first place. What we do know is that your closet does not deserve to be treated like that and your wedge sneakers need a farewell party. 3. Holographic Items \nIt is high time you skipped the intergalactic accessories and come back down to earth. Holographic accessories and clothing needs to stay where they came from; the 90s. 4. High-Low Hemlines \nIf there has to be one kind of dress we hate, even when they were ‘in', it has to be the one with a high-low (or mullet) hem. And now that people in fash-een are finally over them, we can only let out a sigh of relief. 5. Jeggings \nAs Chandler Bing would call these, ‘they're jeans, but feel like leggings'! And sorry not sorry, but these bottoms just don't work for us. If we want comfort we would wear our PJs instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T10:24:25.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
