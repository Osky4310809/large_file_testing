Most recently, the Royal College of Physicians warned that this crisis is “the worst it has ever been”. \nYet Theresa May has her head in the sand, failing to improve the situation. And now, rather than fixing the crisis the Tories have created in A&E, Jeremy Hunt has suggested that there could be further downgrading of the four hour A&E target. \nThe Tories health policies are nothing short of disgraceful, and Theresa May is directly responsible. \nOn the economy, the Autumn Statement showed public sector net debt set to almost double from 2009-10 to 2021-22, with growth and productivity both revised down. It is now clear that the Tories’ austerity politics have failed, and the Government has acknowledged this by abandoning George Osborne’s discredited surplus target. \nOn education, Theresa May is obsessing about new grammar schools which would benefit just a few of our children, but has no plan to deal with falling budgets, chronic teacher shortages and not enough good school places. \nAnd on leaving the EU, Theresa May is steering the country towards a chaotic and destructive Brexit . By failing to provide certainty, Theresa May is putting her party before her country. This is an insult to the British people, as Brexit is the most important political issue that has faced the UK for a generation. \nIt is clear that rather than tackling the challenges we face, Theresa May's policies are divisive and will take the country backwards. Working people deserve better than Tory failure – only a Labour Government will stand up for them and their families. Theresa May's six big failures 1: Theresa May has failed on the economy Theresa May (Photo: Getty) \nIn July, the Prime Minister justified austerity politics by saying “it’s about not saddling our children and grandchildren with significant debt to come.” “He talks about austerity I call it living within our means. He talks about austerity, but actually it’s about not saddling our children and grandchildren with significant debt to come. It’s about ensuring we have an economy that works for everyone.” Theresa May, PMQs, July 20th 2016 \nBut the OBR says that public sector net debt is set to almost double from 2009-10 to 2021-22. \nAnd Theresa May has abandoned the Tories’ discredited surplus target by the end of the Parliament. “We should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the Parliament.” Theresa May, 30 June 2016 2.
