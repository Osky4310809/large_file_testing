Harvard scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could resurrect a woolly mammoth, that they didn’t stop to think if they should. But they should. They definitely and indubitably should bring back from its icy 4,000-year slumber because FUCK YES!!! that’s why. Back from the Pleistocene AKA the Ice Age, the woolly mammoth is ready to stomp on the Earth with its shaggy 6-ton body and 14-foot tusks. \nFrom the Guardian : \nSpeaking ahead of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in Boston this week, the scientist leading the “de-extinction” effort said the Harvard team is just two years away from creating a hybrid embryo, in which mammoth traits would be programmed into an Asian elephant.\n“Our aim is to produce a hybrid elephant-mammoth embryo,” said Prof George Church. “Actually, it would be more like an elephant with a number of mammoth traits. We’re not there yet, but it could happen in a couple of years.”\nThe creature, sometimes referred to as a “mammophant”, would be partly elephant, but with features such as small ears, subcutaneous fat, long shaggy hair and cold-adapted blood. The mammoth genes for these traits are spliced into the elephant DNA using the powerful gene-editing tool, Crispr.\nUntil now, the team have stopped at the cell stage, but are now moving towards creating embryos – although, they said that it would be many years before any serious attempt at producing a living creature.\n“We’re working on ways to evaluate the impact of all these edits and basically trying to establish embryogenesis in the lab,” said Church.\nSince starting the project in 2015 the researchers have increased the number of “edits” where mammoth DNA has been spliced into the elephant genome from 15 to 45.\n“We already know about ones to do with small ears, subcutaneous fat, hair and blood, but there are others that seem to be positively selected,” he said.\nChurch said that these modifications could help preserve the Asian elephant, which is endangered, in an altered form. However, others have raised ethical concerns about the project.\nMatthew Cobb, professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, said: “The proposed ‘de-extinction’ of mammoths raises a massive ethical issue – the mammoth was not simply a set of genes, it was a social animal, as is the modern Asian elephant. What will happen when the elephant-mammoth hybrid is born? How will it be greeted by elephants?”\nChurch also outlined plans to grow the hybrid animal within an artificial womb rather than recruit a female elephant as a surrogate mother – a plan which some believe will not be achievable within the next decade.\n“We hope to do the entire procedure ex-vivo (outside a living body),” he said. “It would be unreasonable to put female reproduction at risk in an endangered species.”\nYou’ll see wet blankets who don’t want the woolly mammoth resurrected say, “The woolly mammoth went extinct for a reason.” To that I retort with, “You know what else nearly went extinct? The Twinkie. Then it was brought back to life and now we not only have Twinkies everywhere, but there’s even Twinkie Ice Cream .” The woolly mammoth could be the Twinkie success story of prehistoric creatures. Think about that. \nOther killjoys want to poo-poo the idea of bringing back woolly mammoths will blab, “Yeah, but look what happened when we brought dinosaurs back from the dead in Jurassic Park .” To that I reply, “That’s a fucking make-believe movie. That would be as idiotic as comparing a processed cake product with something like a elaborate and complex science experiement.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:12:28.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
