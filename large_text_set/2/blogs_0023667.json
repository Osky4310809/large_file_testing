Bangalore Palace. Felix Hug/Gettty Images 1. Bangalore \nBangalore, the capital of Karnataka, is a contemporary, fast growing, and prosperous place that's home to India's IT industry. It's full of young professionals and has a vibrant, cosmopolitan air about it. Although it's not really a must-visit city in India, many people love Bangalore because it's full of greenery, interesting buildings and temples. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Ride Sharing Apps of 2015 Hampi ruins. Getty Images 2. Hampi \nOne of India's top historical destinations , the laid back village of Hampi was once the last capital of Vijayanagar, one of the greatest Hindu empires in India’s history. It has some extremely captivating ruins, intriguingly intermingled with large boulders that rear up all over the landscape. The ruins, which date back to the 14th century, stretch for just over 25 kilometers (10 miles) and comprise more than 500 monuments. An incredible energy can be felt at this ancient place. Badami, Karnataka. Anders Blomqvist/Getty Images. 3. Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal \nWhen visiting Hampi, it's worth taking a side trip to the heritage sites of Badami (formerly Vatapi), Aihole and Pattadakal. The Chalukya empire ruled there between the 4th to 8th centuries, and they're rich in monuments, temples, and ruins from that era. The renowned Chalukya style of architecture originated in Aihole and the village is filled with around 125 stone temples, which unfortunately don't get the attention they deserve. Badami is one of the top places to see caves in India, with four sets of magnificent ancient rock-cut cave temples ( read reviews here ). Pattadakal is smaller, with only one temple complex -- it's impressive though! Do be aware that hotels are scarce, with only a few decent ones to be found in Badami. 4. Chitradurga Fort \nThe well-maintained ruins of sprawling Chitradurga Fort are a hidden, lesser-known gem in the heart of the Deccan Plateau northwest of Bangalore, on the way to Hampi. Much of the fort was built by the Palegar Nayakas between the 15th and 18th centuries. It was later expanded by Hyder Ali, who defeated the Nayakas. Its rocky landscape on a granite hill is peppered with boulders and valleys. Notable features include seven circular walls, 19 gateways, 35 secret entrances, four invisible passages, 2,000 watchtowers, 18 temples in the upper fort, and a huge temple in the lower fort.
