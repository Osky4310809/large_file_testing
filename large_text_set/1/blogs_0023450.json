Candidates are bound to open an election account for meeting poll-related expenditure which is monitored by the EC. \nThe Commission said that with a weekly withdrawal limit of Rs 24,000, a candidate would be able to withdraw Rs 96,000 in cash during the election process which lasts three to four weeks. \nIt reminded the central bank that as per law, candidates contesting Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab can spend Rs 28 lakh each for electioneering. \nThe limit in Goa and Manipur is Rs 20 lakh each. The poll panel said despite paying amounts through cheques, candidates still need hard cash for petty expenses. Also the issue is further adversely effected in rural areas where banking facilities are negligible.   19:30 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T16:28:52.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
