He hurt me. He does it every day.’\nInternal tests on the child revealed traces of semen and swabs showed the DNA of the defendant.\nTeenager convicted for having sex with girl, 15, when he was 18 Mr Smith added: ‘The defendant’s DNA profile was found on these swabs. The Crown cannot say for certain the DNA came from semen but we can say semen was found in the anal canal and DNA was on the swabs.\n‘It could have come from the defendant’s bodily fluids, such as saliva.\n‘The Crown says that proves strong support for the theory the defendant spat on his finger and put it in his anus.’\nThe juvenile defendant was interviewed the next day but denied all the allegations and said only ‘no comment.’\nThe teenager denies the allegations and the trial continues.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T15:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:44:28.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
