Good priority! GbemigaO \nI now understand the reason why ASUU was adamant about getting its own share of the national cake- when we can waste money like this. 1b for a house! Susan \nThe so called leaders of Nigeria don’t give a damn about the masses. The camels back will surely break if this looting frenzy doesn’t stop. Some times I wonder why we as a country sit back and tolerate these donut heads we allow destroy our country and steal our children’s future. Total madness. OKWY \nGEJ can’t do anything about. If wants to stop these guys they will all defect to APC and fight him. They will come up with one or two allegations and we will be clapping for them. Forget all these heartless politicians farooq \n“The four lawmakers had rejected official houses built for them by the FCTA at a cost of N3bn, citing insecurity and delay in the provision of infrastructure. \nConsequently, the construction of the houses by Julius Berger, at the Maitama Extension, was discontinued.” \ninsecurity? N3b? \n!!!! &%$#*%**&%$ \nnow N1.5b bet you this would be reviewed upwards in due course………….naija,the greatest banana republic on earth Koko \nOne can see the reason why Senate/house of rep. will not condemn Oduah for spending N255mil on 2 cars. Nigeria doesn’t have leaders, all they have are rulers. When individual person’s residence is gulping this much, how will there be growth and development in the Country. The other day, it was presidential travel expenses that was reported. Now it is senate president and speaker and few others. Chief judge too is clamoring. Very soon ministers too will agitate. Does any of these people worry about lack of electricity, water, good road, good health care etc for the general masses? Tolu \nSo Bankole bought the house allocated to him as speaker? Rented it back to govt? Another one is being built for speaker…(what happened to monetization) I thought that was the premise for selling away all the more expensive and juicy government properties back in P. Obasanjos time. So the country will not be held responsible again. I thought that was why the accommodation allocation for these wealthy lawmakers was multiplied over, several times. Someone correct me if I’m wrong pls. Educate me The new building is rejected- who claims it? What will it be used for? Is the money wasted? And it was being built by JB. Now another allocation. Wow. This finance director or minister has obviously never worked in a company that plans to make any type of profit. And these houses and billions are just added perks for fat cats on fat and bloated salaries- at least if you earn multiple times more than your contemporaries (in any job) in the USA, then your salary is bloated. These leaders, and I’m sorry to say- ALL OF THEM, have no moral standing. This is rape, of a nation. Broad daylight rape. liberty \nOver 20 years following the movement of seat of government to Abuja; every year we’re building a “new” residence for our leaders. na war! Sir Mark \nOh jonathan, with all these millions budgeted for fuelling generators, when will you improve on electricity that the poor man may not continue to wallow in darkness? Jonathan why did you only love your country in words and not in deed. Nnaemeka Ndubuisi \nIt is not corruption when Tambuwal or the house of reps are involved. Nigeria politicians are all corrupt are deceiving ghe whole nation. Just amount to build houses for them. By the way how many times are we going to build houses for this principal officers? TOBBY777 \nOutside the 150 billion Naira budgeted for the NA in 2014, the minister of FCT proposed another 1.5 billion Naira to build houses for four principal members of the NA . The same persons that rejected 3 bilion Naira house earlier this year. Another 1 billion Naira to build a house fof the vice president. In the midst of such much suffering in Nigeria, when more than 100 million of us cant even feed ourselves with 150.00 Naira day, when there are no employment for our children, the government is plaining to spend 2.5 billiion Naira for the accommodation of 5 persons. This is the one of the most insensitive government in the history of Nigeria. \nThe ministry of Finance outside the more than 51 million Naira on refreshment in the 2014, they will also spend some N76.5 million Naira on fuel. If I may ask, how many generators does the ministry of finance have? How much will it cost Nigerian to fuel such generator(s) daily? \nHow much was budgeted for the Judiciary in 2013? While the travelling cost of the president increased with more than 100 percent from 2013 to 2014, the budget of the judiciary was reduced and we are expecting quick justice delivery system in this country. \nThe office of the secretary to the government got 16.48 million Naira, Youth Development got N1.18 million Naira,Agriculture got N5.57 million Naira. What is budgeted for youth development and agriculture is not up to 50 percent of what is budgeted for the office of the secretary to the government. Another question, does it mean the office of the secretary to the government is not included in the presidency budget? If yes, why allocate money to them again through the FCT budget? Nigeria was scam, Nigeria is still a scam and will remain a scam until we put aside our many differences our incompetent leaders have being using to hold us down and take our destinies in our hands. No sensitive government will go for this jamboree they called budget proposals. TODAY IS YESTERDAY`S TOMORROW. st \nThese issues U are discussing are petty issues. Imagine you mentioning that the finance ministry is to use 51 million on refreshments. Don’t U know they meet over refreshments and not how our money can be better managed. Stop debating such petty issues since the president consider this type of little thievery as petty. TOBBY777 \nMERRY XMAS. TODAY IS YESTERDAY`S TOMORROW.

Ministry of Finance N76.5m \n2. Police formation and command N71.3m \n3. Ministry of Foreign Affaris N56.16m \n4. Ministry of Health N47.62M \nWe will be spending more than N250m Naira on fueling generators for four ministries in 2014. \nCan somebody see the joke they called budget in this Country? How does the common man benefit from all these? \nWe are told we have some 370,000 police offices in ths country and we will be spending close to 1 billion Naira to cloth them. How much does a police clothing cost? We will spending another N238,861,716 on maintenance services (although we were not told what we need to maintain with such amount), we will also spend another N463,935,012 on maintaining police vehicles. We were not again told how many vehicles we will be maintaining with close to half a bilion Naira. We will be spending more than >N735m Naira on rehabilitating police barracks, we will also spend some N131,058,830, and spending some N310,553,170 to buy police vehicles in 2014. What we are spending on maintaining vehicles is more than what we are spending on purchasing vehicles for the police in 2014. We will be spending some N80m Naira on computer and software. \nGving the security challenges in this country, I am in support of good funding of the police, I need further clarifications on how many computers and software will gulp as much as N80m? Hope with this huge budget our police will wake up OUR from their sleeping on duty and give Nigerians the value for this huge expenditure. TODAY IS YESTERDAY`S TOMORROW. alf \nThis money is in Naira and there purchases are in dollars and pounds ooo! Actually these monies as far as i am concerned is even small considering the years of neglect. I tried to contribute my qouta by domesticating lots of things in Nigeria what did I get? I must get a note from the high and mighty to do what will be beneficial to the country and some people must benefit from that! My brother except we look inwards these costs you see will continue cos they are made in foriegn currency and the billions you here are just millions in hard currency and for a whole country, just check the money the police spend in these countries and convert it to naira you will here trillions just for a small part of there operations! Aside sentiments what our objective should be is to see that these little resources mentioned should be used properly without been stolen; then the shout of the opposition and the prudent will make sense to me, not sensetionalizing even a small money that is been allocated for an accummulated mess! janicuk \nThis budgeted money 4 gennerators and fuelling could have used to install solar panels. I can imagine the level of pollution in the country. Most of this politicians and civil servants are using Nigerian banks in London to siphon billions of Naira. Sanusi and Madam Ngozi should take note. First Bank is corrupt. Okay BarkingUk \nFirst Bank Plc Nigeria?. Have you got more stories to tell us?. It’s the order of the day. Transfer millions for us and take your commission to avoid money laundering law. Lemmy \nI am absolutely shocked that we are all here analyzing and ranting when we should all be out there on the streets shedding tears and shutting down the country. We live in so much poverty but have so much affluence around us. Nigeria /Nigerians are a typical example or a diabetic state…suffering in the midst of so much plenty. Im not here to talk about what is going to happen in 2015 election im here talking about now. They know they would get away with this and that all you people would do is just talk. It is about time Nigerians took their destiny into their hands and lest stop this looters from taking us for granted. We do not need to wait for an activist forum who would take credit for the things that we have fought for and even go behind us and get paid for our struggles and sweat and say they represent the masses. Oshiomole in recent times has proven to you that everybody is really out there for themselves but would use our sentiments to build a career for themselves cos i cannot imagine how a former labour leader who was a strong voice against no work no pay would be the one who would enforce it the most. Corrruption is not peculiar to Nigeria but while other countries like Budapest and russia etc fight against it we enshrine and celebrate it. WE HOLD OUR OWN DESTINY IN OUR HANDS AND THE STARTING POINT IS KICKING AGAINST THIS BUDGET. ITS THE LEAST WE CAN DO FOR OURSELVES. rainforest_puppy \nI am with you on this man! Whats the next step?
