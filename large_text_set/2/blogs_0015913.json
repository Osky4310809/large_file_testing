Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said his staff is still working through the pitching assignments for the first weekend of exhibition games. \nThe schedule offers some indications of their direction. \nFor the first time this spring, the Cardinals will have their hitters face their pitchers in a series of drills that is usually called \"Live Batting Practice.\" That name persists although Matheny in his five previous springs has advocated for calling it \"Live Pitching Practice.\" He even uses that phrase when talking to the players, and the designation has appeared on the schedules. \nAdam Wainwright leads the way Sunday morning on the back fields. \nHe and Jonathan Broxton will face hitters, and then five more pairs will follow them onto the fields. This will be the short burst \"Live PP.\" Starters will go about 20 to 30 pitches, and relievers will do the same. Later in the week the starters will split their appearances into two \"innings\" with an \"up-down\" in between the 20- or 30-pitch outings on the mound. From there, they can head to a between-start bullpen and a Grapefruit League appearance. \nMike Leake is set to have his second \"Live PP\" later in the week, and that would put him on target for an appearance in the third or fourth Grapefruit League game. Lance Lynn has his schedule pushed back a little bit from there, and he'll likely appear in the second turn of Grapefruit League games. \nHere are the pitchers throwing \"Live PP\" today: Adam Wainwright, Jonathan Broxton Seung Hwan Oh, Matt Bowman Brett Cecil, Miguel Socolovich Sam Tuivailala, Trey Nielsen Jordan Schafer, Daniel Poncedeleon \nThe Cardinals want the pitchers headed to the World Baseball Classic to be ready for that level of competition, and some of them could appear in games earlier than their peers. Oh is set to pitch Saturday during the Cardinals' first exhibition game and then hop a jet a week from today for Korea and the opening of the WBC with Korea's national team. Cecil and others will follow. \nAsked if he intends to get them game-ready earlier, Matheny just said it was important to have those WBC pitchers ready. \nKevin Siegrist is not yet set to throw. He had soreness in his left shoulder and the Cardinals downshifted his schedule for these opening days. He threw without difficulty or recurring pain on flat ground, and said he intends to advance to throwing off the mound this week. He'll enter the stream of \"Live PP\" and then games a week behind other relievers at this pace. \nThat's not unusual for his schedule. \n\"I already feel better,\" Siegrist said. \"There's plenty of time.\" \nDerrick Goold", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:50:14.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
