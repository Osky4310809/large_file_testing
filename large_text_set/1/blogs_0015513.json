Bowser (D) demanded : “This violence must stop,” and she called for the people responsible for Marrow’s killing to be brought to justice.\nThe mayor also deplored guns on our streets.\nThat part of the story — the presence of lethal weapons all over our city — never makes it into the press.\nSo here, straight from the Metropolitan Police Department’s blotter, is a graphic description of the problem: a list of the weapons D.C. detectives and officers recovered in the District in just over a five-day period (Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017, through this morning — Tuesday, Jan. 17). The linked document includes photographs of recovered guns.:\nThursday, January 12, 2017\nA black and silver .40 caliber Smith and Wesson, containing hollow point bullets and a 13-round magazine, in the 3400 block of 22nd Street, Southeast.\nA black High Point semi-automatic handgun in the 6500 block of Piney Branch Road, Northwest.\nA black 9mm Ruger handgun in the 4300 block of Benning Road, Northeast.\nA black and silver .25 caliber handgun with the serial number obliterated, in the 1100 block of North Capitol Street, Northwest.\nA .40 caliber Glock in the 900 block of Varney Street, Southeast.\nA Glock 17 in the 800 block of 9th Street, Northwest.\nA black and brown Mossburg pump action 12 gauge shotgun (pictured below) in the 1200 block of 16th Street, Northeast.\nA black .40 caliber Glock pistol (pictured below) in the 5300 block of Fitch Place, Southeast.\nFriday, January 13, 2017\nA black .45 caliber Taurus in the 1100 block of Eaton Road, Southeast.\nA black 10 gauge Mossberg shotgun in the 1600 block of V Street, Southeast.\nSaturday, January 14, 2017\nA .22 caliber Mossberg handgun in the 1200 block of Sumner Road, Southeast.\nA black 9mm Taurus (pictured below) in the 1600 block of 17th Street, Southeast.\nA black 9mm Vis 35 Radom in the 4300 block of Brooks Street, Northeast.\nMonday, January 16, 2017\nA black 9mm H&E handgun in the 7000 block of Eastern Avenue, Northwest.\nA black .38 caliber Taurus handgun in the 500 block of Indiana Avenue, Northwest.\nA black .40 caliber Cougar semi-automatic handgun in the 400 block of 51st Street, Southeast.\nTuesday, January 17, 2017\nA black Glock semi-automatic handgun in the 2500 block of Pomeroy Road, Southeast.\nAny citizen or visitor walking the streets of these Northwest, Northeast and Southeast neighborhoods could fall victim to one of these illegal firearms. All the weapons need is someone to pull the trigger — as was tragically the case with grandmother Marrow, who wasn’t bothering anybody. She was just minding her own business when gunfire took her life.\nAnd it’s going to happen again and again. Until we get these agents of death, and those who would use them, off our streets.
