By Brian Batko / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nLe’Veon Bell breaks plenty of tackles, but is he going to break this poor girl’s heart? \nOne of the most prevalent uses of Twitter since its inception has been the chance for regular people to contact and sometimes directly interact with celebrities, star athletes, etc. Well, Saturday afternoon, Twitter user Ava Tarantino (@avatarantino26) pulled out one of the oldest moves in the tweeting playbook on none other than the Steelers’ All-Pro running back: \n@L_Bell26 500 rts and you'll go to prom w me @L_Bell26 500 rts and you'll go to prom w me — Ava Tarantino (@avatarantino26) March 11, 2017 \nThat’s the ultimatum she tweeted at Bell at precisely 4 p.m. Saturday, and what was likely much to her ecstatic surprise, Bell replied exactly a half hour later with “600 & it's a deal”. 600 & it's a deal https://t.co/nUo76cmH8e — Le'Veon Bell (@L_Bell26) March 11, 2017 \nNow, let’s just lay this out simple here: 600 retweets might seem like a lot, but it’s really not. Bell has more than 800,000 followers, so once he puts something out to the masses, that’s a whole lot of eyes on it. To wit, Bell was immediately flooded with such responses as “have fun at prom,”“you meant 600 thousand right?” and “you're going to prom buddy! It's only a matter of time.” \nSo yeah, Mr. Bell really ran himself into a corner on this one. As of 5:11 p.m., barely an hour after the original tweet, Ms. Tarantino’s dare has 847 retweets from people who, apparently, want to see one of the NFL’s best players take her to prom. Heck, even Bell’s reply has more than 500 itself. \nIt’s possible that Bell legitimately wants to go, perhaps. Maybe he was sitting around on social media this weekend, saw the tweet and impulsively thought, “Sure, why not?” But he’s also a superstar pro athlete who probably doesn’t like parading around in random public places, and who could blame him for that? To make matters trickier, the Twitter profile for Tarantino (after expressing “leveon bell is bae” - a term of endearment that stands for Before All Else) indicates she lives in Wisconsin. Waukesha, Wis., to be exact. \nFor her part, Tarantino seems pumped. “THANK U STEELER NATION my heart is so full. just proves we are the best fans” she wrote. \nOnly time will tell if Bell comes through here. More than 45 minutes after his tweet in agreement, he had gone radio silent. Did he just make a girl’s day, or did his thumbs write a check he’s not prepared to cash? At least athletes who get into Twitter hot water can always just claim they got hacked. \nBrian Batko: bbatko@post-gazette.com and Twitter @BrianBatko.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T02:14:23.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
