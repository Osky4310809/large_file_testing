\nKremlin denies involvement in hacks that damaged Hillary Clinton during the campaign Thursday 2 March 2017 09:08 GMT Click to followThe Independent US \nLawyers have ordered Donald Trump ’s administrations to save any potential evidence of alleged Russian interference in the US election. \nInstructions were sent to White House staff after Democrats in the US Senate requested the administration and security agencies to keep all material on links between Mr Trump’s aides, campaign or transition team and the Kremlin. \nAs part of its investigation into Russia’s possible role in the presidential election, the Senate intelligence committee has also asked more than a dozen groups, agencies and individuals to preserve relevant records. Trump denies team had contact with Russia during election campaign \nOfficials told the Associated Press Mr Trump’s staff in Washington were “ordered to comply” with a memo from White House counsel Don McGahn on Tuesday. \nOne source said McGahn's memo instructs current staff to preserve material from Mr Trump's time in office, and for those who worked on the campaign, relevant material from the election. Trump’s Attorney General under pressure to resign over Russia ties \nChuck Schumer of New York, the leader of Democrats in the Senate, said he was worried about the potential destruction of data last week. \n“There is real concern that some in the administration may try to cover up its ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts and other records that could shine a light on those connections,” he claimed. \n“These records are likely to be the subject of executive branch as well as congressional investigations and must be preserved.\" \nA spokesperson for Mr Trump said the administration was ”simply taking proactive steps“ and called the accusations of nefarious ties between the President and Russia ”false and politically motivated attacks”. \nMr Trump has defended Russia against his own intelligence agencies’ allegations of involvement in the Democratic National Committee cyber attacks and other leaks and “fake news” spread to damage Hillary Clinton.
