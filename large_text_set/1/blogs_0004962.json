The Duke guard was reinstated by the team after serving just one game for an indefinite suspension following a third highly-publicized tripping incident . Allen is in the starting lineup for Duke’s home against Georgia Tech.\nAllen became the biggest story in college basketball when he tripped Elon’s Steven Santa Ana on Dec. 22. Allen had previously been busted for tripping incidents against Louisville and Florida State last week. The act set off a round of media pressure for coach Mike Krzyzewski to discipline his star, and Duke reacted with an indefinite suspension that ended up lasting only one game.\nIn addition to the suspension, Allen was stripped of his captaincy by the program. Duke was plastered at Virginia Tech in its only game without Allen, as the Hokies blitzed Duke 89-75.\nDuke’s game against Georgia Tech also doubles as its first since Coach K announced he is taking a leave of absence to undergo back surgery .
