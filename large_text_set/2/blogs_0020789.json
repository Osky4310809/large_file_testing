For her role as Belle in Disney's upcoming live-action film, Beauty and the Beast , the actress rocked upgraded versions of the character's signature blue dress and swoon-worthy ball gown. Today, the star brought a dose of that movie magic to life with her latest look.

The off-the-shoulder dress and the flowing cape made the 26-year-old look like real-life royalty.

According to her new Instagram account, The Press Tour , the bespoke gown was made from end-of-line fabric that was produced in Italy.
