It was directed by Brian Beletic — who also directed the clip for El-P’s “ Deep Space 9mm ”— and follows Killer Mike and El-P as they stand for a police lineup right after the dropped tabs of acid. Here’s what Beletic had to say about the video: \nThe video for ‘Legend Has It’ plays with the theme of guilty until proven innocent. We live in a world where the stronger the truth the greater the opposition. In this story EL-P and Killer Mike are in a police lineup and the cards are stacked heavily against them. But why is that?” And for Run the Jewels, “this video is a worst nightmare scenario. High on acid and caught in the system. Pitted against icons of innocence in a police line up that doesn’t feel real. No bunnies were hurt in the making of this video. \nWatch below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:38:18.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
