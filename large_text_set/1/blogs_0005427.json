They were just cruising along when BAM! Hit an iceberg. Giphy \nThe ship broke in half and started to sink, there weren’t enough lifeboats, women and children went first, lower tiers were stranded, Rose let Jack drown even though there was clearly enough room on that piece of wood but her heart went on… Only now one expert is claiming that the iceberg isn’t what really ruined the Titanic. Giphy \nSenan Molony, an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years studying the Titanic, claims the demise of the ship was due to a fire started long before the iceberg came into play. \nHe is suggesting that there was a fire in the ship’s hull that had been burning for three weeks without anyone noticing, which seems kind of odd, but I wasn’t there so I can’t judge. He said that the fire started near the ship’s boiler rooms, which damaged its hull — creating irreparable damage that made the ship susceptible to the iceberg. via: Wikimedia \nBasically, the fire made that part of the ship weak, so when it hit the iceberg, it immediately fell apart. \nMolony devised this idea by researching photos of the ship when it was docked before leaving for America, and he believes he sees really long black marks on the ship right about where the iceberg hit. And he even has his own conspiracy theory that people knew about the fire, but chose to do nothing about it. via: Wikimedia \n“It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice, and criminal negligence,” he said . “The fire was known about, but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea.” 22 Words Rocks ...AND GETS ALL UP IN YOUR FACEBOOK More posts in #Gallery", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:58:52.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
