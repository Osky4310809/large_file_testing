On Friday at 10 a.m. PST, 10 Lionhead bunnies will compete in the inaugural Bunny Bowl, streaming live on Annie’s Facebook page. Courtesy Annie's Homegrown \nAll this bunny bliss isn’t just for smiles, it’s for a good cause: Players on the field from the two teams — The Longears and The Lops — will be available for adoption following the big game. \nEach bunny featured in the bowl hails from Rabbit Ears Rescue, an organization that saves rabbits on the brink of euthanization from shelters . After the event ends, viewers will be able to adopt and Annie’s will give Rabbit Ears a donation to thank the bunnies for participating. \nLooking for some- bunny to love as Valentine’s Day approaches? Tune in, adopt or simply donate to the rescue to help bunnies in need.
