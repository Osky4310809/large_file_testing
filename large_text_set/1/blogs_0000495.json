ShipSpotting /Foggy \nMANILA, Philippines – Only the small boats of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) are involved in search and rescue operations for 18 crewmen of the Starlite Atlantic that sank in the waters off Batangas on Dec. 26. \nThe BRP Pampanga and monitoring, control and surveillance 3001 had been recalled, Cmdr. Armand Balilo, PCG spokesman, said yesterday. \nBalilo said one of their patrol boats and an aluminum vessel are conducting search and rescue operations with the assistance of PCG auxiliary teams which are expected to send some of their boats. \n“Our ships have conducted an extensive search reaching Quezon province. We also conducted an aerial search, but did not find any of the missing crew,” Balilo said. \nHe gave assurance that the PCG would not stop its search. \n“A person might still be found, so there should still be an asset in the area,” he said.   \nA notice to mariners or NOTAM was issued to alert vessels to be on the lookout for the missing crewmen. \nSome PCG officials raised the possibility that some of the missing crew were trapped inside the ship. \nThe 1,497 gross ton roll-on and roll-off vessel sank due to the strong winds and big waves spawned by Typhoon Nina. \nThe ship sank at around 11 a.m. near Balahibongmanoc island in Tingloy, Batangas. \nThe ship has 33 crewmembers. One of those accounted for died in the accident.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T05:12:10.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
