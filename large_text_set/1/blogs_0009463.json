Demille Award. pic.twitter.com/dxpeCDNXY6 â€” Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017 \nCecil B. DeMille Award recipient Meryl Streep used her speech at the Golden Globes to rip President-elect Donald Trump. Streep addressed \"foreigners\" in Hollywood, bullying and Trump mocking a disabled reporter in her very political address to the room full of actors. \"Ryan Gosling, like all of the nicest people, is Canadian,\" Streep began. \"Hollywood is full of foreigners and if you kick us all out, you'd have nothing to watch but football and MMA,\" the celebrated actress said. \"Which are not the arts,\" she added. \"When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose,\" Streep declared. \"Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence invites violence.\" From Streep's speech where she talked about the \"performance of the year\" that stunned her, the U.S. presidential election: STREEP: Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. If you kick 'em all out, you'll have nothing to watch but football and Mixed Martial Arts, which are not the arts. They gave me three seconds to say this. An actor's only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like. And there were many, many, many powerful performances this year that did exactly that, breathtaking, passionate work. There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good. There was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter, someone he outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it. I still can't get it out of my head because it wasn't in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when it's modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody's life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. And the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. Okay. Go on with that thing. This brings me to the press. We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage. That's why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in our constitution. So I only ask the famously well-heeled Hollywood foreign press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists. Because we're going to need them going forward and they'll need us to safeguard the truth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T12:28:10.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
