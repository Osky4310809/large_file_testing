The barely-there gown has made headlines ever since its inception; and every year, we wait patiently to see if the singer will top the look with another statement-making creation. At the 2017 Grammy Awards, Lopez has caught our eyes once again, but in a pretty, lilac gown worthy of a Disney princess. The multi-talented entertainer wore a \"lavender orchid confection\" straight from Ralph & Russo's spring 2017 couture runway. With its soft draping, flower embellishment, and pastel hue, the look was a departure from the sequined covered numbers we usually see on the red carpet. Worn with sleek straight hair, pretty pink lips, and a pair of sparkly Christian Louboutin heels, the lovely ensemble was certainly a head-turner that will remain in the best-dressed list of all times.
