Apparently, he was rushing to pick up medication left inside a stalled taxi in Glenmarie, The Star reports. \nSelangor traffic police chief Supt Kamaludin Mohamad said the 58-year-old man, who is a taxi driver, is diabetic and has a heart condition. “He used the emergency lane because he was in urgent need of his medication, which was inside his stalled taxi in Glenmarie. He had not taken his medication for more than 24 hours,” the cop said. \nThe cabbie/offending driver told police that he was unaware that an ambulance was behind his car, and that he only noticed it after belatedly seeing the emergency vehicle in the rear-view mirror. “He tried to give way to the ambulance, but it was too late,” Supt Kamaludin said. Police fined the him for abusing the emergency lane. Seems to have got off lightly, don’t you think?

You said u didnt noticed the ambulance was behind your car? okay logically human have 5 senses, how about your sight? you didnt notice the ambulance car was in hurry through your car rear mirror? r u blind? how about ypur hearing? you in panic chasing taxi for your medicine but you didnt hear the ambulance alarm sound was behind you? deaf or what? be positive guys Like or Dislike: \nFrom his story it seems he isnt fit to drive so take back his lisence Like or Dislike: \nask the driver to provide medical proof. also , it is impossible not to realize an ambulance behind, unless he is blasting his sound system in his dark tinted myvi !

In the videocam, he purposely braked so hard that the ambulance almost rear ended his car before he finally sped off. He did that perhaps out of anger because the ambulance was blaring with siren behind him and yet he refused to give way.

Clearly shows that he got away from it. Show his face, Shame him in public. He is wrong because of his ignorance and stupidity. But the truth is he is a selfish road user. Give a heavy punishment. It should be a lesson to all. Shows that the police traffic, JPJ, liow and law enforcer are not serious with the crime he made. Like or Dislike: \nBy law, RM300 fine is max punishment. If 1st time offender, still cannot tarik lesen. And naming & shaming offenders is not built into the road law. So how? Like or Dislike: on Feb 03, 2017 at 11:41 am \nUnfortunately it’s hard to believe, most 58y/olds I know don’t drive as fast. And those who do, are usually very well experienced after decades of driving. They hardly if ever panic when they find themselves in complicated situations. Although there are 50+y/olds who aren’t that good of a driver to begin with and you won’t find themselves in the emergency lane, they’d be creeping at 50km/h in the rightmost lane. Unless, although I hate to say it, if it’s a 58y/old woman. Now that would be a completely different story. Not forgetting the fact that the myvi has blacked out windows along with stickers on the back window? I doubt any 58y/old would do that. Even those with peculiar taste won’t do that. It’s most probably his son driving the car that’s registered under his name. Not saying old people are perfect drivers, but the mistakes that old people do on the road is totally different compared to the types of what younger drivers would commit and the myvi looks like as if it was driven by a younger driver.
