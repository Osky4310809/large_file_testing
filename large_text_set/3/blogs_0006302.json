(Photo: BBC) \nBut he shocks the whole Carter family by refusing to take it. \nAnd with a prison sentence for Mick now looking likely, Johnny urges his dad to tell Linda the truth about Lee and the debts before he gets locked up. Danny Dyer and Kellie Bright as Mick and Linda Carter (Photo: BBC) \nThe 39-year-old actor, who plays Mick Carter, supped a couple of beers on the long haul flight with onlookers saying he looked tired. \nHe has vowed to properly rest for the sake of his family. \nA source said: “Danny knows he has to rest-up and recuperate. He has been ground down by the workload on EastEnders and then partying on top of it. \n“This trip is going to do him the world of good. He can remain anonymous there and he can properly rest.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T13:42:19.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
