(Courtesy video) \nNow, Gino's is ready to grow again. An existing franchisee is looking for an additional location in the Baltimore area, and the fast-casual restaurant aims to open a corporate store in Pennsylvania. \nRomano said the company is still hunting for specific sites. \n\"For good reason, we’ve been stagnant or static in our growth,\" Romano said. \nHe said his company looks to Panera Bread as a bellwether to determine if an area would be a good fit Gino's. \n\"It’s good to have a role model in the business,\" Romano said. \"We’re looking for a degree of affluence as compared to a low-income area. Certainly being by a university is helpful.\" The new Gino's Burgers & Chicken in Glen Burnie will have its official ribbon-cutting on Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Gino Marchetti himself is expected to attend, along with other Baltimore Colts legends Stan White, Tom Matte, Art Donovan and Lenny Moore.

After letting its franchise registration lag during the last few years, Romano said Gino's is in the process of bringing it up to date — allowing more franchisees to come aboard. \nThe new corporate store would also support its franchise expansion. \n\"It enables us to have a live test kitchen,\" Romano said. \"Instead of training new franchisees in franchise unit ... you’re better served training a franchisee in the corporate store.\" \nAs Romano prepares to expand his business, he said he recognizes there is competition from a growing number of burger chains. \n\"What it says is it’s a segment that’s worth looking at,\" Romano said. \"You can’t keep a good thing a secret very long.\" \nBut unlike some national chains, Gino's retains a level of local nostalgia among customers who have been coming for generations. \n\"The iconic residual value of the Gino's brand, particularly in Baltimore, is huge,\" Romano said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:24:54.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
