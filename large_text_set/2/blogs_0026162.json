Most of the children said they were beaten by adults along the way, with girls suffering more abuse than boys.

They beat us, they do not give us good water and good food,\" said Jon, a 14-year-old boy who travelled alone from Nigeria to escape the militant group Boko Haram. \n\"So many people are dying here, dying from disease, freezing to death,\" he was quoted as saying in the report. \nU nicef said women and unaccompanied child migrants rely on people smugglers to get to Europe, often under a \"pay as you go system\", leaving them vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking and violence, including prostitution and rape. \nSmugglers typically demand thousands of dollars from migrants for a risky journey across the desert before cramming them onto ill-equipped boats for a perilous crossing of the Mediterranean.

Aid groups criticised the move, saying such plans exposed migrants to further risks and abuses within Libya.

More than 4,500 people drowned , and at least 700 were children, Unicef said. \n\"Children should not be forced to put their lives in the hands of smugglers because there are simply no alternatives,\" said Khan in a statement. \n\"We need to address globally the drivers of migration and work together toward a robust system of safe and legal passage for children on the move, whether refugees or migrants.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:23:41.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
