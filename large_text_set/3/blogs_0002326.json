Ed Sheeran may have just let the cat out of the bag! During a BBC interview, the \"Shape of You\" singer appears to have indicated when Taylor Swift's highly anticipated followup to her 1989 album could release. WATCH: Ed Sheeran Covers 'Shape Of You' On Classroom Instruments With Jimmy Fallon & The Roots \"Taylor [Swift] isn't going to be releasing until probably the end of this year - Christmas is the smartest time to release because that's when everyone buys records,\" the 26-year-old songwriter shared. \"So I've got a full year of just all Ed, all the time.\" Sheeran and Swift are longtime friends ,so it checks out that he'd be privy to these details. Plus, it certainly fits with the \"Bad Blood\" singer's typical schedule of dropping records in the second half of the year (in failing to release a 2016 album, Swift ended her streak of putting out a record every two years). WATCH: Ed Sheeran Claims He Once 'Got Hammered and Cracked Justin Bieber in the Face' While that means we have to wait a little longer before we can \"Shake It Off\" again like the Swifties we are, Sheeran did admit that the upside to none of his friends having music coming out is that he can focus on his own! \"I think this year is going to be the high point. I have a feeling about it,\" the singer explained. \"Seventeen is my lucky number, and everyone I was scared of releasing of albums around me released them all last year - people like Beyonce and The Weeknd and Bruno Mars.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:00:38.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
