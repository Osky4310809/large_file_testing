Newly constructed roads are damaging while under construction and newly constructed road tunnels turning to water tunnel.” \nThe group also pointed out that other states were implementing policies to reduce the suffering of their people while Imo State government kept spending scarce resources on trivial things. \n“The Christmas decorations and carnival, where millions of naira is spent on jamboree attest to this. \n”By our assessment , we declare that the state government has performed abysmally on its mandate of providing good governance to Imo people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T11:32:44.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
