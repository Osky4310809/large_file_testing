Dragon , commonly known simply as \" Dragon the Revolutionary \", is the father of the Straw Hat Pirates Captain Monkey D. Luffy and the son of the Marines hero Monkey D. Garp . [2] He is the infamous leader and founder of the Revolutionary Army who has been attempting to overthrow the World Government . He is the World Government's greatest enemy, and is the most dangerous and most wanted man in the world. [6] [4] Contents [ show ] Appearance \nDragon is usually dressed this they say he's lhrdjcjen cloak (colored black in the manga), underneath which he wears the garb of a revolutionary, colored white in the anime, and orange in the manga. He has spiky black hair with a widow's peak and a tattoo on the left side of his face, which is colored dark red in the anime, and bright red in the manga. Also, he appears to have no eyebrows. He has a bit of stubble on his chin. He is most often seen sporting a grin. Only on rare occasions, such as at Roger's execution, has Dragon not been seen smiling. [7] \nTwenty two years before the start of the series, at Gol D. Roger's execution, Dragon did not have his tattoo or his stubble. \nAfter the gubjbj poDragon's hair has grown slightly longer - reaching down his back past his shoulders. Gallery \n{{Gallery|width=150|height=150|position=center |Dragon's Color Scheme in the Manga.png|Dragon as he is drawn with his hood in the manga. |Dragon_manga.PNG|Dragon as colored in the manga. |Young_Dragon.png|Dragon as he appeared twenty four years ago, during Roger's executio Personality \nDragon's personality is mostly unknown due to the many mysteries that are surrounding him, save for an apparent love for freedom and a belief in fate, traits of a \" D \". Despite this, he is serious about his crusade, warning his subordinates that the conflict against the World Government will be protracted and arduous. \nDragon has a stern demeanor. However, he is often seen with a confident grin on his face. The only other D known to share this demeanor is Trafalgar D. Water Law. \nDragon bears concern for common people and fights against the World Government's oppression towards them, as shown when he rescued the denizens of the Gray Terminal and offered them a position in the Revolutionary Army. \nHe speaks as though he is a mystic and apparently does not like to speak of, or be asked about, his past. He also has a habit of always looking towards the East Blue when the wind changes. His revolutionary comrade Emporio Ivankov speculates that this is because he has family in the East Blue. [8] Relationships Revolutionaries \nThe Revolutionaries were relieved to find out that their mysterious leader is in fact a \" human \" when they heard that he is the father of Luffy and son of Garp. This shows that the Revolutionaries are loyal to Dragon since no one deserted him due to learning of his heritage. Emporio Ivankov Dragon speaking to Ivankov at the HQ. \nEmporio Ivankov is one of Dragon's comrades and one of the commanders of his revolutionary army. Ivankov apparently understands Dragon's habit of looking at the direction of East Blue whenever the winds blow, as though he is homesick. However, Ivankov had no knowledge of Dragon's family until after he met Luffy years later, which led the commander to protect him at all cost. It is unknown how Dragon met Ivankov. Bartholomew Kuma \nBartholomew Kuma was once a member of Dragon's crew and the Revolutionary Army, as shown in a flashback when Dragon rescued the people of Trash Mountain in the Goa Kingdom. His relationship with Dragon is still a mystery, though he knows that Luffy is Dragon's son, a fact that even Ivankov did not know until he met the boy. Though Kuma was working with the Revolutionary Army in secret as a Shichibukai, his final modification into a full Pacifista now places him fully under the World Government's control. Dragon is seemingly aware of Kuma's deal with the Marines. Sabo \nDragon's hatred of the nobles does not seem to include Sabo. In fact, Dragon was shocked to hear the boy's shame of being born a noble, and listened to what he had to say. Following the the boy's confession to the plot, Dragon and the Revolutionary Army rescued the citizens of the Gray Terminal. He later saved Sabo's life and allowed him to join the Revolutionary Army, where he eventually rose up the ranks to become the Army's Chief of Staff. Sabo refers to Dragon as \"Dragon-san\" and appears to be loyal to him and is trusted enough to lead the Revolutionary Army's investigation of Dressrosa's weapons trade. He also granted Sabo permission to obtain and consume Ace's Mera Mera no Mi . Upon Sabo's return to Baltigo following his mission to Dressrosa, Sabo personally informed Dragon about how Luffy was during his report. Family Monkey D. Garp \nDragon is the son of the famous Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp . [2] No direct interaction has been seen between the two. However, Garp was casual towards telling Luffy about Dragon's criminal status, going so far as to pick his nose while saying this. He even laughed when he realized he should not be telling people that kind of information. There appears to be some sort of understanding between the two, as Garp stated that the reason why Dragon was in Loguetown was to see Luffy set off for the Grand Line , but Dragon ended up rescuing Luffy against Smoker's Seastone Jutte. \nIt is clear that both Garp and Dragon have different assessments of the East Blue. While Garp perceives it as a rather peaceful place, Dragon expresses his disgust with Garp's view of \"peace\" since it was nothing more than a form of oppression authorized by the law in places, such as Tequila Wolf and the Goa Kingdom, evidently forcing common people to inhabit horrible living conditions. \nIt was Dragon's being Garp's son that made him a target for Chinjao's grudge when the revelation was made worldwide. [9] Since Chinjao gave up his grudge against both Luffy and Garp when Luffy restored his old head, it can be assumed that he gave up his grudge against Dragon as well. Monkey D. Luffy Dragon appears on the news about Luffy's return. \nLuffy is Dragon's son. [2] Like his own father, Garp , he seems to hold high expectations for Luffy. And although he has yet to introduce himself to Luffy, Dragon appears to support his son's actions thus far. He appeared in Loguetown to see Luffy off to the Grand Line [1] and stopped Smoker from capturing him, showing that he cares for his son's well-being, [10] though he did not seem to have participated in raising Luffy himself. Even after his men learned of their connection, Dragon just casually confirmed it. Dragon also appears to be incredibly proud of his son because of all the trouble Luffy has been causing for the World Government . His unusual habit of standing in the wind and facing East Blue (where he had left Luffy), apparently means that he misses his son. When he was informed about Luffy's second intrusion in Marineford , he decided to focus on his own goals, thinking that Luffy was old enough to take care of himself. Allies Nico Robin \n10 years before the Battle of Marineford , Dragon had ordered his men to locate the sole surviving Archaeologist of Ohara , Nico Robin who became known as the \"Light of the Revolution\" among the Revolutionaries. Though his exact reasons for doing so remain unknown, it is known that he wanted to meet Robin for a long time (even before she became a member of his son's crew). After the Revolutionaries liberated Nico Robin from Tequila Wolf after she was sent there by Kuma, Robin decided to meet with Dragon after receiving Luffy's message to wait 2 years in the newspaper. During those 2 years, Nico Robin became acquainted with Dragon and the other Revolutionaries like Sabo and Koala . During the Zou Arc, Dragon shows some concern about Robin's well-being as he asked Koala about Robin after the Revolutionaries had returned from their mission to Dressrosa, due to rumors that she had been captured on Sabaody . Enemies World Government \nDue to the fact that he is the leader and main center of the largest anti-government organization in the world, Dragon has been dubbed the most-dangerous and the most-wanted man in the world by the World Government . As Nico Robin has said, many people and organizations (especially pirates) try to steer clear of disrupting the World Government and drawing attention to themselves. \nHowever, the organization led by Monkey D. Dragon does the exact opposite. Although many people call him a revolutionary, the World Government feels that his ideals and goals can collapse the strength and justice of the World Government. So far, it seems the World Government is the only known enemy of Dragon. Regardless, just being the son of Dragon is enough to make Luffy a target for \" justice \". Marines \nThe Marines being the World Government's primary military force have much disdain for Dragon and his ideals, especially Akainu for unknown reasons. Sakazuki was also one of the only people who (before Sengoku made it public) was aware that Luffy is Dragon's son and that Dragon is the son of Garp. It is unknown if that was simply common knowledge amongst high ranking Marines or not. However, the marine soldiers were shocked when they learned Straw Hat Luffy's father was none other than the Revolutionary Dragon. Smoker , then-captain of Loguetown's base, was surprised to see Dragon there, and even more confused and angry when Dragon saved Luffy from capture; it was not until the Battle of Marineford that Smoker fully understood why Dragon intervened, at that point he saw Luffy as an even more potential threat than ever. Nobles So you've finally forced your own children to say things like this, Goa Kingdom!! ” — Dragon's thoughts on hearing Sabo's cries. \nDragon seems to hold much hatred towards the Goa nobles for destroying Gray Terminal, and saved the residents of the junkyard as an act of defiance to the nobles who tried to kill them. Dragon's hatred of the nobles does not seem to include Sabo. In fact, Dragon was shocked to hear the boy's shame of being born a noble, and listened to what he had to say. His hatred may not be absolute, it is unknown what he thinks of Nobles who are good to their people, like Dalton, Cobra, Vivi, and the Riku family. \nHis hatred also extends to the World Nobles as well, as after saving Sabo from the wreckage caused by Saint Jalmack, Dragon was furious at his actions. Blackbeard Pirates \nAs a result of Jesus Burgess being defeated by Sabo and the Mera Mera no Mi having been consumed by Sabo, the Revolutionaries became enemies of the Blackbeard Pirates, who attacked and destroyed the revolutionaries base at Baltigo. Other \nNo mother or wife (if he was ever married) has been named for Dragon. However, both were left as \"?\" in the supplement issue Grand Line Times . As a carrier of the Will of the D. , he may also be related to other D's. It is unknown, prior to Sengoku making it public to the world, if Dragon knew that Portgas D. Ace was the son of Gol D. Roger , or if he was aware of Ace's adoption into the family (though his subordinate Kuma did know). But Ace was aware that Dragon is Luffy's father (before it was announced to the world by Sengoku). [11] Abilities and Powers \nHe is the leader of the Revolutionaries and has full command of the organization. There have been some hints that Dragon is extremely powerful, since the World Government has dubbed him as the \"World's Most Wanted Man\". After Luffy tells Emporio Ivankov that Ace is his brother, the okama queen greatly fears the possibility of the World Government warring against Dragon along with Whitebeard. \nDragon is already a powerful threat in his own right, as well as having powerful subordinates such as Sabo , Emporio Ivankov , Bartholomew Kuma , and Inazuma who are in comparison, lower in rank. This only speaks volumes of Dragon's true power. When Sengoku told everyone of his relationship with Luffy, most people were stunned, including Gekko Moriah of the Shichibukai and members of the Whitebeard Pirates . This reputation alone was enough for Luffy to be marked as a dangerous potential to the future, and for Demaro Black to take advantage of via impersonation. \nIvankov has been seen commenting on how Luffy's will to live and his phenomenal strength only helps to prove the idea that he is indeed Dragon's son, implying that Dragon has similar strength and will.
