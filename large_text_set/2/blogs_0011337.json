Santu, 26 Relationship Status: Single Nothing. Maybe I'm salty, but I've never received any gifts. Not a phone call. Nothing. I mean... every day is Valentine's Day. You wanna talk? Call me. Anonymous, 34 Relationship Status: Single Absurd, commercialised, more obsessed on being regarded as a special day than it actually is. Licence for stupid behaviour in a milieu which makes a habit of being absurd anyway. Rahul, 28 My kid sister's birthday. That's it!!! Samiksha, 27 Relationship Status: Single (not very happy about it) It's just a commercial gimmick. Shibani, 30 Relationship Status: Adventurous My thoughts on V-Day? Potty, puke, although offers on food in restaurants can be a win. But, since they are only for couples, that makes the day super potty. Unless you have a (single) guy or girlfriend for company. Anonymous, 29 Relationship Status: Lover American capitalism, hallmark cards, and designed culture. If you need a special day to express love more than any other day, you're probably a prick the rest of the year. Pavani, 23 Relationship Status: Committed Gimmicky, pointless day. Also, considering nobody who actually \"celebrates\" Valentine's Day has any idea about the origins of said day, it's purely a jump on the wagon because everyone else is doing it. Massive marketing success of warping a celebration, though (like crackers on Diwali). P.S. - My 14-years-old sister now believes that it's Valentine's week, not day, apparently involving Rose Day, Propose Day, and some other such nonsense. Anonymous, 29 Relationship Status: Confused, maybe I think it's a good excuse to spend some uninterrupted time with your boyfriend. That's all. I don't care much about celebrating it in a grand way, or anything. Just a good reason to go out, or take a trip or something. Because we all get busy with our lives. So, it's nice to take time out for each other. Robin, 28 Mindless consumerism. Also, a chance for the loony brigade to get people married off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:46:48.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
