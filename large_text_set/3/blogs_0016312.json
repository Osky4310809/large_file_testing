Talk about your problems It’s easier said than done, but talking about things really, really helps. No matter how big or small, a problem affecting your state of mind matters. Even if the problem isn’t actually resolved through talking, even if the person you’re talking to can’t physically help, there’s no greater sense of relief than getting something that is bothering you off of your chest.\n(Picture: Mmuffin) 2. Listen to some music Not just for the love of music, but for those three-and-a-half minutes where you’re doing nothing but listening. In that time, your mind completely drifts away, and you won’t even notice it happening. Listening to music – whatever genre you like – can be incredibly calming and can help give you a quick time-out when it’s desperately needed.\n3. Focus on your diet While some refuse to acknowledge it, your diet can really affect your state of mind. According to Mind Charity , if your blood sugar drops, you may feel ‘tired, irritable and depressed’. They recommend eating regularly to keep the sugar level steady, and to choose foods that release energy slowly.\n(Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler fot Metro.co.uk)  \n4. Drink lots of water Mind Charity explains that if ‘you don’t drink enough water, you may find it difficult to concentrate or think clearly’. So, if you’re feeling fuzzy-headed and confused – make sure you’re remembering to stay hydrated!\n5. Exercise According to mentalhealth.org , exercise affects more than just your physique. They say that exercising also has a staggering effect over our mental wellbeing.\nThey note that exercising can give you ‘the sense of feeling good’ about yourself and helps us to feel connected to our community and surroundings – adding that exercising can help us gain a sense of purpose in life.\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) 6. Get creative Colouring books are known to help you de-stress. They can also contribute to bringing back memories of childhood, a time when you were young, free and doing nothing but playing.\nIn an interview with Best Health Magazine , Tim Bottos, associate professor of creative arts therapy at Concordia University in Montreal said that colouring books can be good for people experiencing anxiety.\n‘The image is already there; it’s a bit of a scaffolding that gives you a place to start from to build your confidence,’ he said.\nHe also noticed that it is a great way to relax, even describing colouring as a ‘type of meditation’.\nHe said: ‘The brain loves rhythm, and there’s a rhythmic motion with your hand when you colour. You’re distracting your mind a bit by doing this rhythm, and it takes you out of the spiral of your problems and what you have to get done.’\n7. Compliment yourself It may sound silly, but hear me out.\nMany of us suffer with low self-confidence. Instead of picking ourselves up, we drag ourselves down by insulting parts of our body that we don’t like and therefore becoming insecure about them.\nInstead of doing this, stand in the mirror and try to appreciate yourself. Pick out something small that you like about yourself to start – be that your hair, your eyes, even your little toe – and compliment it. As time goes on, and you feel more comfortable, compliment bigger things.\nTell yourself how great you look when you smile, and how good your bum looks in that dress. And mean it.\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) 8. Seek help from online support groups As someone who suffers with bipolar disorder, I am on many online support groups. I personally recommend them to anyone who feels they are dealing with mental health issues – no matter diagnosis.\nThrough these groups, I have been able to meet people who have experienced how I feel, and people I can open up to without feeling judged because they just get it.\nIt’s a very comforting feeling knowing there are so many individuals in the same boat as me that I can access with just a couple of clicks.\n9. Book an appointment with your GP So many people feel embarrassed about seeking help from a GP when they shouldn’t. Just because a problem isn’t physical, doesn’t mean it’s not a problem.\nWhile your GP may not be able to diagnose you if they think you have a serious mental health condition, they will be able to guide you on what to do, and may even refer you to see a specialist.\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk) More: Health I'm still scared of how coming clean about my mental health will affect my career \nAnd breeeathe: The 5-minute stress busting workout \nI spent my Saturday nights in hospital: How hypochondria ruined my life \n10. Accept medication if you need it I can’t stress this enough: there is nothing weak about taking medication. Some people need it, some people don’t. But if you feel you need it, and you have been offered it by your GP or psychiatrist, don’t feel scared about taking it.\nIf anything, you are helping to get your mental health back on track and are taking control. See it as a strength, not a weakness.\nBecause that’s exactly what it is.\nHappy International Happiness Day!\nMORE: World Sleep Day: How not getting enough sleep can affect your mental health \nMORE: M&S is launching cafes where people can chat about mental health ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T12:59:57.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
