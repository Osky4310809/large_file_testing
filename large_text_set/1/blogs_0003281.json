But abduction and torture of another human being – a mentally retarded human being – just for the sake of amusement, and to make a Facebook video? \nIf that’s not evil, the word has no meaning. \nSadly, but not surprisingly, it wasn’t just Lemon and his morally bankrupt guests who were so benighted. The Washington Post headlined a column with a similar theme , “Pro-Trump narratives converge in one awful attack streamed on Facebook,” as though the worst thing about the attack (for a liberal) was that it could help the president-elect’s poll numbers in the run-up to Inauguration Day. \nConservatives have been warning for decades that an America governed by liberalism would lose its soul. One could argue that a country that countenances the murder of millions of unborn children with their dismembered body parts sold for profit had already proven that. \nBut to experience — and then to broadcast to the world — the pure evil of moral confusion that liberalism has fostered, one good look at the Lemon panel discussion will do it. \nWhat happened in Chicago was evil. What happened on Lemon’s CNN show was worse. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
