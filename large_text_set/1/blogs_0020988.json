2017 09:09 BST Click to followThe Independent Online Palestinian territories such as East Jerusalem and the West Bank were due to receive the funds AFP/Getty Images \nThe Trump administration has reportedly frozen a multimillion dollar aid package granted to the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the final hours of Barack Obama’s presidency. \nPrime Minister Rami Hamdallah was told by US officials not to expect the $221 million payout earlier this week, the Times of Israel reported, citing a senior PA source. \nMr Obama had overruled Congress to make the decision, with the money intended to support good governance and humanitarian aid. What happens if Trump moves the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem? \nBut the State Department is now thought to be reviewing the payment and may make changes so it aligns with the priorities of the Trump administration. \nCongress had approved previous donations to the PA – it received $250 million in aid from the US in 2016 to support humanitarian costs, hospitals and buying fuel from Israel, according to the source. \nBut Republican politicians placed a hold on the most recent payment, which Mr Obama then forced through, ignoring the norm of respecting congressional decisions. \nThe House was informed by former Secretary of State John Kerry hours before Mr Trump’s inauguration.
