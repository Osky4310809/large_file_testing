Only 250 to 300 of these birds remain in the wild,” ABC said.\nFlooded palm-tree snags where Blue-throated Macaws nest. Photo by Tjalle Boorsma, Asociación Armonía.\nFrom American Bird Conservancy:\nSince 2008, with support from American Bird Conservancy (ABC) and other partners, Armonía has been protecting key roosting and feeding grounds of the largest remaining wild Blue-throated Macaw population at Barba Azul Nature Reserve. Recent sightings of 118 macaws—a record high—indicate a healthy increase of the macaw population there, a sign that Armonía’s conservation program is working.\nHowever, most of these birds only use Barba Azul in the dry season, from May to November. They disperse to breed at the beginning of the rainy season, which runs from November to April, and return to the reserve in small groups starting in March. The mystery has been where these birds go to breed.\nThe beginnings of an answer arrived in January 2016, when Armonía’s Blue-throated Macaw Conservation Program Manager Gustavo Sánchez Ávila discovered 15 roosting birds north of Barba Azul during an expedition supported by Loro Parque Foundation . With this evidence in hand, Armonía kicked off the search for breeding grounds to the north, with support from ABC and The Cincinnati Zoo .\nThe nesting period of the Blue-throated Macaw coincides with the region’s rainy season, when the Beni savanna, the grassland habitat that covers the much of the area, is mostly flooded and makes traveling by car difficult. The Armonía expedition set out on horseback, led by Barba Azul Nature Reserve coordinator Tjalle Boorsma.\nA demanding 130 km (70 mile) ride led the team deep into the flooded grasslands, northwest from the boundaries of the reserve. Initially they focused their searches on forest islands of motacú palm. In the reserve the Blue-throated Macaw prefers these trees, foraging year-round on their abundant fruit.\nAt first the expedition met with no success. “We registered a significant number of Blue-and-yellow Macaws in the area but, to our surprise, the motacú-dominated forest islands showed no signs of Blue-throated Macaws,” Boorsma said.\nAt last the team sighted a pair of Blue-throated Macaws flushing from an elongated patch of royal palms. “The discovery gave a new scope to the whole expedition,” Boorsma said.\nThe birds had been perching in dry royal palm snags flooded by recent rainfall and difficult to access. That natural barrier could very well be the reason that the macaws choose these palm snags for their nesting cavities.\nTo confirm that the Blue-throated Macaws were indeed nesting there, Boorsma concealed himself in a makeshift palm blind. After six hours of patient waiting, he observed the cautious Blue-throated Macaw pair return to their nest. A second nest was later discovered in another dead royal palm trunk.\nTwo more nests were found in totaí palms at another location about 50 km northwest of the reserve. In that case, the birds chose locations 50 meters (164 feet) away from a populated farm, and showed no signs of disturbance from being in such close proximity to humans and livestock.\n“That was the missing piece we needed to complete our investigations,” Boorsma said. “Now we definitively know that Blue-throated Macaws prefer totaí and royal palms to nest in, as dead palm snags provide an excellent vantage point from which to observe their surroundings.”\nIt’s too early to know for sure whether the macaws found during the expedition are the same birds that visit Barba Azul Nature Reserve in the dry season or whether they constitute a separate population. To answer this and other questions about where the birds go, a group of experts led by an independent researcher, Lisa Davenport, is in the process of testing tracking devices suitable for this species, so that tagged birds can be traced during their seasonal migrations.\nLearn more about the expedition here , and to help support work to conserve Blue-throated Macaw, here .\nAmerican Bird Conservancy is dedicated to conserving birds and their habitats throughout the Americas.
