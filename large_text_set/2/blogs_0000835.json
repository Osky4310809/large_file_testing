The app hits the ground running thanks to it being based on Works Mobile, a service run by Line Corp parent company Naver that already has 68 million users in Japan.\nPhoto credit: Line Works.\nWhile Line itself is losing users, dropping from 220 million to 217 million at the end of last year, the social network pocketed a number-of-the-beast profit of US$66.6 million in 2016, replacing the similarly sized loss it made in 2015.\nLine Works, a paid service after a free 30-day trial, could help boost the firm’s finances – and perhaps Line’s user base as well.\nThis post Line launches Slack rival appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:03:38.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
