ALL COLORS NO GENRES is their main mission – from hip-hop to indie, electronica, R&B and pop, COLORS BERLIN allows artists to present themselves and their work in a contemporary way. We’ve teamed up with them on a series of video shorts in which artists are invited to perform one of their own tracks in the COLORS studio. \nIt has been on hell of a year for Che Lingo. The South London emcee rode a wave of critical acclaim from his initial singles to go on to release the Better Versions EP last month. The EP is Lingo’s most concise body of work to date, and its arresting visual accompaniments only solidified the fact that he would be an artist to watch.\nAnd should anyone need any further proof of his talents, his performance of the song “Zuko” for COLORS Berlin will dispel any lingering doubts. While he may not have the same speed of delivery as his peers, his lyrical dexterity is truly a force to be reckoned with.\nWatch the music video for “Better Versions” below.\n\nBe sure to check out our previous installment of the COLORS Berlin series with Kirk Knight right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T13:29:54.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
