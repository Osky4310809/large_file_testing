Stone tortoise \nA month later animal collection officer Alan Farr was asked by a homeowner to help find a trapped bird which was making a \"peeping noise\" in her loft. \n\"After searching around and unable to find the mystery bird, I then went into her front room and found a smoke alarm beeping after the battery had gone flat,\" he revealed.
