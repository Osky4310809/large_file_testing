Most Popular By Charles P. Pierce Jan 3, 2017 There is a reason why the phrase is \"in the dead of night.\" Murderers love the cover of darkness. And our congressional majority is nothing if not diligent and, apparently, as we learn from CNN , it never sleeps. \nRepublican members voted 119-74 -- breaking with party leaders -- during a closed-door meeting in favor of Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte's proposal, which would place the independent Office of Congressional Ethics under the control of those very lawmakers, a move that outraged Democrats and outside ethics organizations…The change in rules carries the appearance of House members taking power away from the office that can investigate them for misconduct, at a time when Republicans are about to have control of two branches of government with a mandate for shaking up Washington.   Let us examine the delicacy of the prose here for a moment. \"Breaking with party leaders\" implies that, at best, Speaker Paul Ryan has been struck with professional catatonia. Since he is the Biggest Fake Ever, I doubt that's the case. And I also appreciate that this move carries the \"appearance\" that the sign reading \"To Let. Cheap\" has been hung on the Capitol dome. My guess? More than a few of our incoming solons already are contemplating the \"appearance\" of taking bags of lobbyist cash to the \"appearance\" of a bank in the Caymans. Most Popular If We Tolerate This, What Won't We Tolerate? But parsing the coverage can distract us from the sheer, balls-out audacity of the gift that the outgoing congressional majority has given to the incoming one. Investigations into professional misconduct by members of Congress will now be tossed into the conventional committee process. Even the president-elect senses with his animal instincts that this may be a step too far, so he scrambled to the electric Twitter machine to register his guarded disapproval. With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017   may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 (I think that's Hashtag-Drain-The-Swamp. My Trumpspeak Rosetta Stone program should arrive any day now. In any case, the swamp seems to be remarkably resistant to draining.) My cynical mind tells me that this little burst of outrage will pass, and that the general public won't remember it by the end of the week. But somebody should file it away, so here we are. UPDATE: Let's be completely clear. El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago isn't condemning the House's action. He's just saying that it looks lousy and that they should have waited until later to do it. If you get fooled into thinking he's expressing opposition, you're just the sucker he's looking for. UPDATE THE SECOND: The ethics process presently under assault was developed in response to the activities of Casino Jack Abramoff who, at one point or another, held paper of a very large percentage of the nation's lawmakers. He went off to the federal sneezer for a spell and has emerged as an anti-corruption crusader. And, yes, according to Tiger Beat On The Potomac , Casino Jack thinks what's going on is remarkably sleazy. \n\"While there seems to be little question that some of the procedures of the Office of Congressional Ethics can and probably have created collateral political problems for innocent Members of Congress, moving to diminish oversight is exactly the opposite of what Congress should be doing.\" Preach, my brother. UPDATE THE LAST: Well, they have, for the moment, stepped back from the swamp. Let the dumbshow begin! From CNN : \nHouse Republican leaders have pulled a proposal that would gut its independent ethics panel, amid widespread criticism of the plan, multiple lawmakers tell CNN. The decision comes less than two hours after President-elect Donald Trump criticized the timing of the vote, which was scheduled for the first day of the new congressional session. Trump called out his fellow Republicans Tuesday for proposing to curb the powers of the independent ethics panel as their first move of the year, although the President-elect suggested the ethics panel was \"unfair.\" There was a general uproar long before the president-elect wandered onto the electric Twitter machine on Tuesday morning. But that's not going to be the story that gets told. We are rapidly approaching the weeping crucifix chapter of the tale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T22:35:30.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
