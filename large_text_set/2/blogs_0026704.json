By and large, PDA is a cultural phenomenon , and is more accepted in western cultures than it is in places like India . We know this. The majority of the countryfolk here are not comfortable watching a couple in love, or steal kisses while in a busy mall. Yet, not all of us completely refrain from physical contact with our partners, when in public. Some of us are comfortable with indulging in some PDA, and some of us aren't. But, what gives? Is it that those who are okay with it are only acting from a place of rebellion? Wanting to break the rules, and do as they please? If they're 15, then, maybe yes. According to psychologists , those of us who indulge in some PDA do so simply because we are in love, and feel affectionate towards our partner. It is simply a spontaneous act of showing them that we enjoy being with them. To the ones doing it, it seems like an innocent act. It is not deliberate, or based on an agenda. It is simply a manifestation of how happy and comfortable they are with their partner. In fact, research shows that some amount of PDA can even strengthen long term relationships! So, that's that. PDA is nothing but an expression of love and desire. But, there is a caveat. Nobody likes to watch two people in the middle of a full-blown make-out session. So, we need to remember to keep the PDA appropriate. Pecks, holding hands, a gentle touch on the small of the back, and other such physical expressions of love are okay. Tongues down each other's throats... maybe not so much. The purpose of showing physical affection to your loved one when you are not in a private space, is to make them feel safe and important. That's what the touch has to communicate.
