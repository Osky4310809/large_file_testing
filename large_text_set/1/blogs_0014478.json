And the press went crazy. So I said, ‘Let’s not move it.’ But some people in the press will not be able to get in.” \nTrump added, “We have so many people that want to go in so we’ll have to just pick the people to go into the room – I’m sure other people will be thrilled about that.” \n“They’ll be begging for a much larger room very soon. You watch,” he said.   \nEsquire first reported that the incoming administration was interested in moving the briefings out of the West Wing and into a larger space in the nearby Old Executive Office Building. However, it framed the issue as a plot to “evict the press from the White House.” \nFollowing the report, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer explained the rationale behind the move Sunday on the Fox News program Media Buzz. “This is about greater accessibility, more people in the process,” he said. Adding more people who aren’t from the mainstream media, like bloggers, “should be seen as a welcome change,” Spicer said. \nThe White House Correspondents’ Association wasn’t satisfied with that explanation. Its president, Jeff Mason, said in a statement Sunday: The White House Correspondents’ Association has always advocated for increasing access and transparency for the benefit of all news outlets and the public. \nI emphasized the importance of the White House press briefing room and noted that it is open to all journalists who seek access now. \nI made clear that the WHCA would view it as unacceptable if the incoming administration sought to move White House reporters out of the press work space behind the press briefing room. Access in the West Wing to senior administration officials, including the press secretary, is critical to transparency and to journalists’ ability to do their jobs. \nThe White House Correspondents’ Association is responsible for seating arrangements and access to the 49 seats in the current press briefing room within the White House.
