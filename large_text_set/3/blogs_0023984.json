You have to embrace it and where you are as a footballer,\" he said. \n\"I've made a long way until now but the road is still long and I know I have to improve and get better. I want to help Everton as much as I can, as well as the national team. I think a lot of stuff can be achieved. \n\"Sometimes people will mistake things that I say but it's just ambition that I have; I want to win titles and trophies and I don't think people should take that as arrogance -- people should embrace it. \n\"This is what footballers need to achieve if they want to become the best, and I think young kids need to learn that too.\" Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:05:51.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
