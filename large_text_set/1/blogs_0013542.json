Choreographer Kenrick Sandy and co-director/composer Michael Asante have previously rebooted The Pied Piper, and created a martial arts/manga adventure. But this new show, Blak Whyte Gray, moves towards something deeper and more abstract, reflecting a bleak view of the world with just a hint of redemption. \nIn three parts, we see a clear progression from restricted bodies to frustration to freedom, cleverly using different hip hop styles to embody each mood, whether robotic popping, aggressive krump or infectious house. We open with Whyte, and three straightjacketed performers (including the brilliant Gemma Kay Hoddy), their bodies hinging and freezing like malfunctioning droids. Confined to a small cage of light – courtesy of lighting designer Lee Curran, who has worked with Hofesh Shechter and brings some of that same brooding atmosphere to this show – it's a triumph of awesome technique. \nIn Gray, the group breaks out to becomes a bigger clan, a gang, a battalion, fired by the anger of injustice, perhaps, at the current state of the world. 'Is everybody in the world going to die before someone finds the answer?' asks the soundtrack. There is brute force and fine precision, heavy feet slapping the floor, sharp jolts firing though hips and chests. Sandy knows the impact of tightly unified manoeuvres, his early work was built on slick, poppy formations, and he can still harness that power in this more expansive piece, with bodies in syncopated synchrony against the music's spare, pounding beats and heart-thumping bass. \nThe mood is dark, and it stays that way, even as, in the final movement, Blak, the dancers begin to loosen, bodies convulsing as if organs are trying to push their way out of rippling torsos. Dancer Dickson Mbi undergoes a transformation into a statuesque sensei. He is a startlingly powerful performer, able to morph from heavy, bold moves into elegant italics. The best dance shows to look forward to in 2017 \nThis is a claustrophobic, relentless work, with tightly drilled choreography that has moments of throwaway genius – eschewing the idea of easy, virtuoso tricks and climaxes – and it's a serious step into artistic maturity for the company. Although there's some disjointedness in the shifts between tracks/scenes and they really make us wait for the payoff, this is a impressive progression for Boy Blue, beyond just the realm of Entertainment. \nUntil 21 Jan, Barbican; barbican.org.uk \nVisit standard.co.uk/arts for the latest news and reviews from London’s arts scene. \nFollow Going Out on Facebook and on Twitter @ESgoingout More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T13:16:02.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
