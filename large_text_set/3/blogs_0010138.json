Pete and Chloe pose with Lockie earlier in the evening (Photo: Rex Features) They were seen embracing and looking very cosy together (Photo: Rex Features) \nPete, who seemed more than comfortable with the situation, looked directly into her eyes as she came closer, and they were then seen with their faces nearly touching. Chloe looked chic and stylish on her night out (Photo: Rex Features) Pete was spotted at the TRIC Awards with James Lock - with no Megan in sight (Photo: Rex Features) \nNeither Pete nor Chloe have publicly commented on the situation yet, although Pete did tweet last night to say he couldn't sleep. \n\"Over an hour I've laid here in the dark, no phone, nothing...why the f**k can I never sleep?\" he posted at 1.16am. \nWhile he's done nothing wrong, Megan is sure to object in the strongest possible terms to this latest TOWIE twist. Will Pete and Megan end their relationship on-screen? (Photo: ITV Picture Desk) \nShe took to Twitter last night to blast Pete for reportedly saying he'd be going on Celebs Go Dating, adding that she'd stayed quiet about their split out of respect for him. \n\"As he's been 'blabbing' and bragging about other Tv shows I will now confirm we are OVER and have been over for a while. End of the speculations. Now let me move on with my life. Thanks,\" she angrily posted. Chloe has previously counselled Megan on her relationship (Photo: FameFlynet) She comforted her during filming at Qube nightclub on March 8th (Photo: FameFlynet) \nIn the previous three episodes of TOWIE's 20th series, viewers have watched as Pete and Megan struggle to cope with their tempers. \nAnd with Chloe deciding not to pursue a romance with Gatsby, she's now free and single to focus on other relationships. \nCould this lead to the most explosive TOWIE storyline yet? \nTOWIE returns tonight at 10pm on ITVBe. \nMirror Celeb has contacted Chloe's team for comment.
