There were protests against Arsene Wenger by some Arsenal fans prior to the game \n\"We were a bit nervous because your confidence drops when you don't have the results,\" added Wenger. \n\"The team was unjustifiably criticised for our last game against Bayern Munich because we had an outstanding game. \n\"The game was killed not by the fault of the players but we have to look at the bigger perspective. \n\"Overall, we had to respond and that's what we did.\" Lincoln boss proud of historic journey Media playback is not supported on this device FA Cup: Danny Cowley 'proud' of Lincoln City's FA Cup journey \nThe defeat for Lincoln brought to an end their historic FA Cup run, in which they became the first non-league side in 103 years to reach the quarter-finals. \nAround 9,000 fans made the trip south to cheer Lincoln on and boss Danny Cowley praised their \"world class\" support. \n\"We need to learn from this journey, not just from today but this journey,\" he said. \n\"And if we can really, really learn and take something from playing against world-class players then we will be better footballers and players as a result.\" \n\"I did our fans a massive disservice in the week because I said they were Premier League. They were much, much better than that. \n\"You saw world-class players play today in the Arsenal team but you also heard and witnessed world-class supporters because that's how good they were.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T01:05:44.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
