I feel for a few of the players still there. \n“They still have a few really good players. Ben Osborn, Henri Lansbury, Michael Mancienne, they were there when I was there. \n“I don't think they are getting treated fairly for what they are offering and giving to the club. \n“That is my homegrown club, I was there from eight years of age. I wish them all the best.” Lascelles spent 13 years attached to Forest (Photo: 2013 Getty Images) \nSkipper Lansbury wants to quit this month as his contract is up in the summer and the club have received a £3million-plus bid from Aston Villa. \nLansbury has cleared out his boots from the training ground and said goodbye to team-mates. \nThe 26-year-old midfielder was left out of the Cup defeat to Wigan at the weekend because his head was not right. \nBut the former Arsenal youngster is still waiting for Al Hasawi to sign off the transfer, while fellow in-form midfielder Osborn is also wanted by Championship rivals Newcastle.
