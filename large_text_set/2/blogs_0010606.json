When Gov. Jerry Brown declared the emergency on Sunday night, the state’s price gouging law goes into effect:\n“For a period of 30 days following that proclamation or declaration, it is unlawful for an owner or operator of a hotel or motel to increase the hotel or motel’s regular rates by more than 10 percent.”\nWe spoke to state Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber) about the reports of gouging.\n“Stop this deplorable act,” he said. “This is not what people need at a time of great need for them.”\nThe question now is who will enforce this. Nielsen says he’s looking into it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:18:57.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
