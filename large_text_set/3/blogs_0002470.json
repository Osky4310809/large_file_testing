But since Mr Trump’s Twitter tirade – made without evidence – the news agenda has shifted to the surveillance allegations. Trump's wiretap claim 'could be a matter that brings down a president' \nThe White House has demanded an investigation into the “Watergate” level allegations as part of any enquiry into Russian connections with the Trump administration. Mr Trump has maintained his support for Mr Sessions. \nMr Earnest told ABC News: “We know exactly why President Trump tweeted what he tweeted. Because there is one page in the Trump White House crisis management playbook. And that is simply to tweet or say something outrageous to distract from a scandal. \n“And the bigger the scandal, the more outrageous the tweet.” Former director of national intelligence denies there was a 'wiretap' at Trump Tower \nMr Earnest did not deny that surveillance may have occurred, but said the President cannot “unilaterally order” the wiretapping of a US citizen. \nFor surveillance to have taken place, Mr Earnest said, FBI investigators would have needed probable cause as part of a criminal or counterintelligence operation. A judge would need to approve the case before any such operation could take place, he added. \nMr Obama denied the allegations at the weekend as “simply false” but stopped short of saying outright that there was no surveillance of Trump Tower.
