(File photo) \n\"The Great British Baking Show\" returns June 16, with an additional season also picked up, PBS has announced. \nThe season set for June on PBS, the fourth seen in the United States, is the most recent that aired in the UK. It is also the last, as fans have known it. \nAfter the production company said it was moving the show (known at home as \"The Great British Bake Off\") from the BBC to the UK's Channel 4, judge Mary Berry and hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins all handed in their notice. Judge Paul Hollywood will remain with the series in its new incarnation. Why we love to watch people bake \nThe additional PBS season will be an older one previously unseen here. \n\"The Great British Bake Off\" is one of the most popular series on British television. In the format, home bakers are challenged to make increasingly difficult cakes, pies and other baked goods, with eliminations weekly. \nABC copied the format with \"The Great American Baking Show,\" which just ended its second season (the first had \"Holiday\" in the title). Berry was also a judge on the U.S. series. \nPBS programming executive Beth Hoppe said \"The Great British Baking Show\" \"has emerged as one of PBS’ most popular programs, with the third season, debuting last July, ranking as the most-streamed program on PBS this past summer. We’re thrilled to continue airing this warm and charming competition for at least two more seasons, and continuing to build its popularity on these shores.” \nGail Pennington • 314-340-8136", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T09:45:38.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
