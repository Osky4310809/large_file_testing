This is what happens when you’re a small dude and a hard-hitting defensive player gets their hands on you.\nBeasley caught a pass from Dak Prescott during Dallas’ NFC divisional round game against Green Bay. While he was running after the catch, he ran towards Kentrell Brice in the open field.\nBrice, a rookie safety for Green Bay out of Louisiana Tech, lowered his shoulder and just destroyed the diminutive receiver. This is a picture-perfect example of what an open field tackle should look like. Beasley was fine, but he’ll absolutely feel this one after the game.\nHere’s a slow motion version of the hit, because everything looks like it hurts more in slow motion.\nSeriously, how did this hit not break him in half?\n(Via BroBible )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T01:46:53.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
