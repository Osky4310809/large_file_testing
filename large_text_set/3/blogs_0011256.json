14, 2017 \n…Fixes April for hearing of prosecution’s witness protection motion \n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja Tuesday ordered that six Boko Haram leaders and a woman be remanded in Kuje prison, Abuja pending the conclusion of their trial. \nThe order for their remand was made by Justice John Tsoho shortly after they were arraigned on an 11-count charge. \nThe six, who were said to have later formed a splinter group from the Boko Haram known as Jama’atu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan (a.k.a ANSARU), were arraigned with the second wife of one of them. \nThey were charged with conspiracy, hostage taking, giving support to terrorist group, being members of terrorist group, being in illegal possession of firearms and concealment of information about act of terrorism. \nThe defendants are Mohammed Usman (aka Khalid Albarnawi), described as the leader of boko Haram splinter group known as Jama’atu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan (a.k.a ANSARU) and Mohammed Bashir Saleh. \nOthers are Umar Bello (aka Abu Azzan); Mohammed Salisu (Datti), Yakubu Nuhu (aka Bello Maishayi), Usman Abubakar (Mugiratu) and Halima Haliru, second wife of Mohammed Usman. \nHalima was charge, in count in 11, with concealment of information from security agebcies about her husband’s involvement in the activities of a terrorist group \nUsman, Saleh, Bello, Salisu, Nuhu, Abubakar and others said to be at large of conspiring between 2011 and 2013 in Sokoto, Kebbi, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe and other states in the northern part of Nigeria “to commit act of terrorism”. \nThe offence is said to be contrary to section 17 of Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 as amended in 2013 and punishable under the same section of the Act”. \nThey were also accused of hostage taking contrary to section 15(c) of Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 as amended in 2013 and punishable under the same section of the Act. \nThe defendants were accused of being involved in the murder of “internationally protected persons” contrary to section (3) (a) of Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 as amended in 2013 and punishable under the same section of the Act. \nThey were said to have in February 2013 at Ikirima Boko Haram Camp of Sambisa Forest, murdered seven “internationally protected persons”, while Usman and one late Abu Mohammed allegedly, on March 8, 2012, murdered four others. \nUsman and the late Mohammed also accused of kidnapping Christopher Mcmamus (Briton) and Franco Lamoliara (Italian), at Birni Kebbi on May 12, 2011, and continuing to detain the two expatriates at Mabera area of Sokoto State up till March 8, 2012. \nThe two expatriates were said to be carrying out construction work in Birni Kebbi, Kebbi State, on May 12, 2011, when they were kidnapped by the two alleged terrorists. \nUsman and the late Mohammed were said to have murdered and buried Mcmamus and Lamoliara in a shallow grave on March 8, 2012. \nIt was also alleged that the accused persons, on February 18, 2013, kidnapped Carlos Bou Azziz, Brendan Vaughan, Silvano Trevisan, Konstantinos Karras, Ghaida Yaser Sa’ad (F), Julio Ibrahim El-Khouli and Imad El-Andari, at Life Camp Yard of the SETRACO construction company in Jama’are, Bauchi State. \nThe defendants were said to have detained the seven expatriates at Ikirima Boko Haram camp in Sambisa Forest for a period of 10 days. \nThey allegedly “intentionally murdered” and buried the seven foreigners in a shallow grave. \nThe defendants pleaded not guilty when the charge was read to them by an official of the court. \nOnly two of them claimed to understand English, prompting the court to engage the service of an interpreter, who interpreted proceedings to them in Hausa. \nShortly after the defendants’ pleas were taken, prosecuting lawyer, Shuaibu Labaran told the court that the prosecution intends to bring an application for witness protection as required under the Terrorism Prevention Act. \nHe said the prosecution intends to open it case shortly after its witness protection motion is heard and determined. \nBefore then, Labaran urged the court to remand the defendants in the custody o the Department of State Service (DSS) where they have been since they were arrested. \nDefence lawyers, M Attah and K. Abdulkareem (who represented only the 6th defendant – Abubakar) opposed Labaran’s application as it relates to the place of remand. \nThey expressed preference for prison, noting that their clients have not had access to members of their families and lawyers since they were arrested by the DSS about five years ago. \nThe defence lawyers argued that beside that the law requires that defendants must be remanded in prison after arraignment in court, it will be easier for their clients to see their lawyers and relatives if they were remanded in prison. \nRuling, Justice John Tsoho rejected Labaran’s argument that the state would prefer that the defendants were kept in DSS’ custody. \nThe judge said the state was with sufficient capacity to provide security for any category of defendant irrespective of their detention facility. \nHe said since it was the provision of the Constitution that the place of remand after arraignment was prison, the court cannot act otherwise. \nThe judge consequently ordered that the defendants be remanded in Kuje prison, Abuja and adjourned to April 11 for further hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:32:23.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
