McGregor kicks of his verbal assault by claiming Mayweather isn’t a true fighter, but merely a boxer.\n“Yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s great. Except you use the term ‘fighting’ differently, because he’s not been fighting for 40 years. He’s been boxing for 40 years. There’s a big difference between boxing and fighting. Boxing is limited fighting with a specific rule set. Fighting is true, where you can do anything.” \nOK, yes, but if the two ever fought, the match would take place in a boxing ring, so that doesn’t really matter, right?\n“We’re talking about boxing. That’s it. But again, age waits for no man. He’s 40 years of age. He’s a little…he’s got a little head on him. Honestly, my fist is bigger than his head. I sleep people. I put people unconscious. I’m stating facts. If I hit that man, his head is gonna go into the bleachers. You understand that? If I crack that little head of his, it’s gonna go clean off his shoulders and up into the bleachers.” \nMcGregor seems content to keep up the trash talk until Mayweather finally gives in, but even if he can’t get that big-money fight, the Irishman is prepared to take on some other big names in the boxing ring.\n“I mean, that’s the one that everyone wants, that’s the one that makes the most sense. But I’ve no problem going and slapping the head off one of his opponents that he couldn’t finish. All he does is decisions. He can never stop them. So all I have to do is pick some schmuck out that he only could decision, bounce the left hand off his dome, sleep him, and then there you go: It’s already done.” \nFor more on McGregor’s plans for the future, as well as some, um, interesting comments on the Kardashians, head over to GQ Style to read the entire profile .
