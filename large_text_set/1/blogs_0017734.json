The press event will begin at 10 a.m. on Monday, January 23 in the time zone of its native country of South Korea. That means it will take place on Sunday, January 22 at 8 p.m. Eastern time and 5 p.m. Pacific time in the US.\nSee also: The worst blunders of 2016 (besides the Note 7) 3 weeks ago Samsung’s statement about the press event says that the company will be joined by representatives of “independent expert organizations” that have also looked into the Note 7 issues. Shortly after the phone began shipping in the fall of 2016, a number of them exploded, causing damages to cars, houses and other property. Samsung stopped selling the phone a few weeks after it went on sale, and also issued a complete recall of the units that were shipped beforehand. The company has also sent out software updates to any remaining Note 7 phones designed to cut down its battery life or shut it down altogether.\nIn addition to revealing the results of their investigation, Samsung says the press conference will also see the company “unveil new measures Samsung has implemented in response to the incidents.” The event will be livestreamed on Samsung’s website.\nUnconfirmed reports claim that Samsung will put the final blame on the Note 7 issues firmly on the battery , rather than any hardware or software problems with the phone itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T03:31:30.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
