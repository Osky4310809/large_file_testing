Share Cara (left) and Annamarie (right) in happier times (Photo: Handout) Share Get daily   \nSaving lives was all in an average day for married couple Annamarie Cochrane and Cara Rintala. They were both paramedics and worked around the clock helping people in need – as well as raising their daughter. \nOutgoing Annamarie had been dating Cara for eight years. Cara was seven years older and much quieter, but the couple would finish each other’s sentences and quickly fell in love. Annamarie moved into Cara’s home in Granby, Massachusetts, and they started building their family. \nAnnamarie was known for her compassion. She’d wrap blankets around the homeless and take them to a shelter in cold weather. She’d hand lunches to strangers and went out of her way to make people laugh. Annamarie’s motto for life was, ‘Live, laugh, love.’ \nWithin five years, the couple had married and adopted a week-old baby girl called Brianna – but there was tension in their relationship. Annamarie was reckless with money and ran up credit card debts in the tens of thousands, which didn’t go down well with more sensible Cara. \nThere had also been many disputes – some of which had ended up with the police being called. Once Annamarie claimed Cara had abused her and she wanted to take out a restraining order. Cara was arrested and charged with domestic assault but Annamarie dropped the charges when the couple later reconciled. \nBut their relationship remained strained, and by 2009, Cara had filed for divorce. \nThey continued living together, and the arguments didn’t stop. They both accused the other of threatening behaviour and took restraining orders out. \nCara told a judge, \"She constantly threatens me that she’s going to take away my livelihood, my home and my daughter.\" \nThe judge was frustrated by their squabbles and questioned whether they were stable enough to look after their daughter. He said he would call child services if the pair didn’t sort things out. \nAnnamarie, 37, eventually moved out and started a secret relationship with a police officer called Carla Daniele, but within a few months she was back with Cara, leaving Carla with debts. Hysterical \nThen, at 7pm on March 2010, one of their neighbours heard his doorbell. It was Cara. She was hysterical and handed over Brianna, now two, saying Annamarie was in the basement. \"Dial 911,\" she cried. \nWhen an officer arrived, he could hear Cara yelling from the basement. Down the stairs, he found Cara sitting on the cement floor with Annamarie’s body face-up across her lap. It was covered in white paint and smeared in blood. \n\"She’s dead!\" Cara sobbed. \nAnnamarie’s body was stiff and cold, like she’d been dead for hours. Cara had flipped her over onto her lap and was wedged under her. \n\"We’ve been arguing since yesterday,\" Cara cried. \"We should never leave each other mad.\" \nCara said she’d returned from doing errands with Brianna and found her wife’s body. Cara was interviewed for hours. She said she’d taken Brianna out at 3pm so Annamarie could sleep before her 8pm shift. CCTV and her debit card use confirmed they’d visited several shops and fast food restaurants. \nWhen Cara returned to the house she claimed she looked upstairs in the bedroom for Annamarie then heard her daughter say, \"Mummy’s in the basement.\" \nDuring her interview, Cara openly complained about Annamarie’s debt, her temper and how lazy she could be. It was odd behaviour from a grieving widow.

There were also discrepancies in Cara’s story. CCTV picked up a laundry basket and a red bag in Cara’s pick-up truck when she was out, but it was never found. There was also blood on a rag found in a bin at a McDonald’s that Cara had stopped at. Experts argued over whether the blood was Annamarie’s. \nCara was the prime suspect but the evidence was circumstantial and the case went cold. Cara sold their house and moved to Rhode Island to be near her parents. \nBut the police hadn’t given up. In October 2011, Cara was finally arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Prosecutors knew that the jury would be able to see the couple had a turbulent relationship from the restraining orders they had taken out against each other. And there were angry texts between them leading up to Annamarie’s death. All that was missing was physical evidence. Destroy the evidence \nExperts testified that Annamarie was killed between noon and 2pm – an hour before Cara left the house at 3pm. Then there was the paint. It was a type that is pink when wet and turns white when dry. The paramedics said that the paint was still pink when they arrived, suggesting it was poured over Annamarie hours after she’d been killed. When Cara ‘discovered’ her wife’s body, did she cover it in paint to try and destroy the evidence? \nOn February 2013, the case went to trial. It was the first trial in Massachusetts where a woman stood accused of murdering her wife. Prosecution said Cara had \"ended the marriage, once and for all, with her own two hands\". \nThe defence said that other suspects hadn’t been investigated thoroughly because it was flagged up as a domestic dispute. They suggested Carla could have been a suspect, along with a male friend Annamarie had been seeing a lot of. \nWhen it came to the paint colour, it couldn’t be proved that it was still pink when paramedics arrived because the dimly lit crime scene photos failed to show the colour clearly. The blood that was found on the rag at McDonald’s was disputed because the DNA was so degraded. \nThe court heard that Annamarie had multiple blunt force traumas and over 20 bruises on her arms, back and legs, consistent with a fall downstairs. Annamarie had been spending money to the point of serious debt and had threatened to take Brianna away. \nHad Cara returned home, pushed her wife down the stairs then realised another assault charge would destroy everything, so strangled her? Cara didn’t take the stand to defend herself. \nThe jury deliberated but couldn’t prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt and a deadlock caused a mistrial. Again, at the second trial in 2014, the jury couldn’t agree and another mistrial was declared. This time Cara was released on a £120,000 bail. \nThe last trial started in September 2016. Could the prosecution prove once and for all that Cara had strangled her wife in a fit of rage? \nThey reminded the court that Annamarie was dead before Cara left the house and outlined the elaborate way she’d covered up her crime by going on errands, using her debit card and calling Annamarie’s phone. \nAn expert testified that the paint would dry in 30 minutes but was dripping off her body when it was discovered. Cara was the only person who had the opportunity to do that. \nFinally, after three trials, Cara, now 49, was found guilty of murder and gasps filled the courtroom. Cara broke down in tears when she heard the verdict. \n\"My daughter, my daughter,\" she cried, referring to Brianna, now aged nine. \"I’m so sorry.\" \nShe was given the mandatory state life sentence without the possibility of parole. \nIn victim statements Annamarie was described as a ‘passionate paramedic who saved lives’. It had taken six years and three trials, but finally justice was served for the life she couldn’t save. Her own.
