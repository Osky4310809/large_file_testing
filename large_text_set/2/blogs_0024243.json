In general, Republicans are getting torn apart by voters wanting to know what they’re going to do about issues like healthcare.\nLike this woman who says if Mitch McConnell can answer any of her questions, she’ll “sit down and shut up like Elizabeth Warren.”\nAngry constituent gives Mitch McConnell the what for pic.twitter.com/tyHseJVtqd \n— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 21, 2017 \n\nOr this woman, who tells Senator Tom Cotton she’ll die if she loses her insurance covering pre-existing conditions.

And while there was a good amount of organized protest within people’s own home districts (not being bussed in from those coastal liberal elite cities, as Trump loves to claim), for the most part, these look to be average citizens, just showing up to take part in the democratic process laid out in front of them.\nBLACKSTONE, Va. — Half of Main Street lined with people for @RepDaveBrat town hall at 7 p.m. pic.twitter.com/94tgZmfrk5 \n— Dan Zak (@MrDanZak) February 21, 2017 \n\nAt a town hall in in Colorado, citizens hold up their state IDs to prove to GOP that they are 100% real constituents pic.twitter.com/t2ABatcfJ4 \n— Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) February 22, 2017 \n\nAngry constituent tells Tom Cotton she’s not a paid protester.
