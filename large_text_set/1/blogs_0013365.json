As per reports, she got engaged on Sunday 15 in a private bash attended by a few friends. The lady says it is far from true. However, Bharti confirmed that she is getting engaged but the ceremony would happen only by end of January. Bharti said she was surprised that congratulatory messages were coming in advance for her engagement. So, what the special occasion that fuelled the speculation? It was a house-warming bash. \nBharti told the Hindustan Times, “It was a housewarming ceremony, as Haarsh has bought a new house in Andheri. Since there was a puja and havan, we couldn’t offer drinks after a religious ceremony, so we took our friends out for a party.” The lady also expressed her displeasure at people spreading rumours about her relationship status. She feels it is totally unfair. “If I partied, drank and posted pictures, it’s assumed that I got engaged. Tomorrow if I shoot for an episode and wear a bridal outfit, they’ll declare my wedding also. If I bought a car, they’ll say it’s a gift from Haarsh. If I flaunt my ring, they’ll assume he has put it on my finger. Why? Am I not making enough money? I slog so hard to earn and then to read such demeaning things is so unpleasant. We went to Dubai for a show and people said we have gone out for a pre-honeymoon. What is that supposed to mean?,” said an angry Bharti to the paper.

However, she says that false news pertaining to her bothers her mother and family a lot. Bharti says she belongs to a middle-class family and rumours do affect them. The lady says she is still a small-town girl from Punjab. She stated, “My mother hasn’t read the news yet, but she will get to know from someone I am sure. I don’t have a father, so my mom gets even more worried that her daughter is facing all this humiliation.” \nBharti also came clean on news of Haarsh and her taking part in the couple dance show, Nach Baliye. She confirmed that they have indeed been approached. Bharti says she is keen to do it but Haarsh is not very enthusiastic about it. “He is just not ready and is saying he doesn’t want to get embarrassed on national television,” said the stand up comic. Talking about her wedding, Bharti t old the paper, “No date has been fixed as yet. It would be either the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Also, contrary to the reports that I and Haarsh have been dating for two years, I’d like to clarify that we have known each other for seven years and this is our eighth year together as a couple.” Stay tuned to Bollywood Life for more scoop and updates….", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T14:24:14.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
