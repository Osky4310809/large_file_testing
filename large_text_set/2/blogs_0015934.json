Few manufacturers venture into this area as users generally want a smartphone that is a minimum of 5.2-inches. Luckily, Samsung and Sony are an exception to this rule. What’s the Sony Xperia X Compact like compared to Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017)? Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) review: the mid-range phone that thinks it's a flagship Sony Xperia X Compact vs Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017): design \nHere we have two different styles. On the one hand, there is Sony and their monolithic smartphones with sharp angles and, on the other, we have Samsung with their curved design with more curves on the back of the device. Other than these visual differences, the main difference is the choice of material: while the Galaxy A3 (2017), like most flagships, opts for metal and glass, the Xperia X Compact simply opts for plastic which is elegant but, for some people, it’s not a top-range material. \nSony tends to offer waterproof smartphones but it has changed its strategy with the Xperia X Compact: the waterproof feature has disappeared. It’s a shame because it has lost one of its biggest features, and allows the Galaxy A3 to have an advantage over it, as the A3 has an IP68 certification that its predecessor lacked.

On the Samsung device it's located, as usual, on the Home button at the bottom of the screen, between the two smart keys. On the Sony device, it is located on the side, on the power button. Another similarity: both phones allow you to use a microSD card with a maximum capacity of 256 GB. On the Sony device, the card slot is found on the side while Samsung have placed it on the right-hand side for the first time. \nWith its 129 x 65 x 9.5 mm dimensions, the Sony Xperia X Compact is slightly smaller than the Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) which has dimensions of 135.4 x 66.2 x 7.9 mm. As you can see by the figures, the A3 is thinner. Both devices are exactly the same weight: 135 grams. The difference can’t really be felt when handling. A small screen for a typical Samsung S7 design. / © AndroidPIT \nSamsung based their device’s design on their flagship, and the excellent brushed finishes and the premium aspects are undeniable. Sony offers a smartphone made of plastic which follows the brand’s design rules which will thrill Sony fans but it won’t please other users. While appearance is a matter of taste, I would have a preference for Samsung due to its waterproofing. Sony Xperia X Compact vs Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017): display \nThe X Compact is slightly smaller and this is reflected in the screen size. It measures 4.6-inches diagonally, whilst its Korean competitor measures 4.7-inches diagonally. This could be a deciding factor for some, but another element forces the issue: the Sony smartphone occupies more space with 69.9 % against 67.9 % on the Samsung. \nBoth devices have the same definition, 720 x 1,280 (HD definition). The screen technology isn’t the same. Samsung uses, as usual, AMOLED while Sony uses IPS LCD but, in practice, both screens are high quality. Each has its advantages, the Sony Triluminos technology is good for color rendition while the AMOLED technology allows you to use the Always-On-Display mode. Despite its HD definition, the X Compact’s screen performs well. / © AndroidPIT Sony Xperia X Compact vs Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017): software \nBoth phones run with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow although they were marketed several months apart. With that said, the Nougat update is available for the Xperia X Compact while the A3 is still limited to Marshmallow for the moment. It’s hardly surprising that both devices use their manufacturer's overlays: Xperia UI for Sony and TouchWiz for Samsung. Xperia UI is slightly closer to Stock which will thrill the purists, but TouchWiz has become rather elegant, especially if you compare it to the appearance that it made on previous models. TouchWiz vs. Xperia UI: cluttered or minimalistic? TouchWiz will be familiar to Samsung users. / © AndroidPIT \nIn both cases the use is fluid and intuitive. That said, both devices have the same default feature: preinstalled applications. It’s true that the amount of bloatware has decreased but it’s still annoying to have applications on your phone that you never wanted to use and you can’t delete them (unless you're willing to play around with it, of course). This is really a question of preference and habit. Sony Xperia X Compact vs Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017): performance \nWe’re talking about mid-range devices so you wouldn’t expect poor performance. Although they are far from able to rival current flagships, they don’t lack potential. The Sony smartphone has 3 GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 650 hexa-core processor running at a maximum frequency of 1.8 GHz with two Cortex A72 cores. The A3 has 2 GB of RAM and uses a Samsung octa-core processor, the Exynos 7870 running at a frequency of 1.6 GHz. \nIn practice, you won’t notice many differences. In normal, daily usage, both devices are fast, neither suffer from bugs or delays, and they can handle more or less any game without issue and without the phone overheating. Whatever your choice, you won’t be disappointed. \nBoth devices are fast and neither suffer from bugs or delays. \nThe Sony device offers a better internal memory. With 32 GB, it allows users to take/store more photos and videos than the A3 which only has 16 GB. On the other hand, the X Compact isn’t great for its SAR: with 1.08 W/kg for the head and 1.25 W/kg for the body, it’s poor. Samsung offers 0.349 W/kg for the head but 1.38 W/kg for the body.
