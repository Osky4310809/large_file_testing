And I thin particularly now we need that. You come out fuller than when you went in.” \nAnd the star found it “really fun” playing the lead role as the iconic Disney princess because she was able to “pad” out her characters backstory. \nShe added to the Mail Online: “That’s the wonderful thing about Belle I feel like even in the original she was very progressive she was kind of a departure from a lot of the other Disney princess characters and so I think it was really just where in the moments I can fill in a bit more of her back story I can pad her out a little bit more, it was really fun to be able to do that.” Actress Emma Watson (Photo: AFP) Actress Emma Watson (Photo: AFP) Actress Emma Watson (Photo: Rex Features) \nHowever, Emma’s co-star Dan, 34, who was cast as the Beast felt there was pressure on him to do the film justice because he “loved” the fairy tale when he was growing up. \nSpeaking previously at the London premiere of the production, he said: “The biggest responsibility I really felt was to myself. I loved this fairy tale growing up and fairy tales in general, and I like them well told, and the animated feature told it well. But every generation comes at a myth from a slightly different angle and maybe reads into it and we need these tales at different times.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:48:18.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
