Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 A Complete Rundown of Meryl Streep's Red Carpet Style \nWe can sum up Meryl Streep 's red carpet style in one word: elegant. She's been attending award shows since the '70s, which means she's been honing her signature look for quite some time. You won't ever see the actress in a flamboyant dress or barely-there midi; instead, she keeps her outfits modest and timeless. \nJust what types of dresses does Meryl gravitate toward? In particular, she has a preference for draping and sleeves, going with designer Lanvin time and time again. In addition, Meryl has long belted her gowns to show off her waistline — a trick no doubt she learned from the pros over the years. \nBut just because she sticks to modest choices doesn't mean she won't take a fashion risk here and there. She's done the plunging neckline look and worn off-the-shoulder pieces on several occasions. She hired Lupita Nyong'o's stylist Micaela Erlanger to step up her outfit game for the 2017 Golden Globe Awards , where she wore a custom-made Givenchy gown. \nIn fact, since Givenchy has a standing tradition of dressing only one star for an awards show, Meryl was the only one to wear the fashion house on the red carpet. In true Meryl fashion, she pulled the look off gracefully.
