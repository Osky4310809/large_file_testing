I have to make choices but choices that I would always share with my owners, with my board.” \nWhile competing on multiple fronts has been an obvious bonus for United this season, it is pushing them to their limit. \nA midweek clash with Rostov is the second of five fixtures in 16 days, with Mourinho admitting that he may have to rotate his squad in order to keep key men fresh and chase down top targets. \nIrwin: Man Utd must take rotation risk \nHe added: “For now it’s just to play against Rostov, play against Chelsea, play against Rostov again and then let’s see how we are in all the competitions and try to make the right decisions. \n“To finish second [in the Premier League] is better than to finish third and to finish third is better than fourth and fourth is obviously better than not being in the top four and not going to the Champions League. The second position is very difficult but it’s very possible. First is impossible. Second is possible and we have to fight for it.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T02:45:58.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
