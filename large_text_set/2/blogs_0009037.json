Huge “if” there, mind you. This is Moby we are talking about after all, and only America’s democracy at stake. No big deal.\nIn short, the musician states that the salacious details included in the leaked dossier are “100% real,” and believes the Trump administration is in “collusion with the Russian government, and has been since day one,” allegedly with the aim to provoke a war with Iran.\nHere’s Moby’s full post :\n\nAnd if, for some reason it is deleted, because this is the internet and things like that happen, here’s the full text from Moby’s outrageous claims.\nafter spending the weekend talking to friends who work in dc i can safely(well, ‘accurately’…) post the following things:\n1-the russian dossier on trump is real. 100% real. he’s being blackmailed by the russian government, not just for being peed\non by russian hookers, but for much more nefarious things.\n2-the trump administration is in collusion with the russian government, and has been since day one.\n3-the trump administration needs a war, most likely with iran. at present they are putting u.s warships off the coast\nof iran in the hope that iran will attack one of the ships and give the u.s a pretense for invasion.\n4-there are right wing plans to get rid of trump. he’s a drain on their fundraising and their approval ratings, and the gop and koch\nbrothers and other u.s right wing groups are planning to get rid of trump.\n5-intelligence agencies around the world, and here in the u.s, are horrified by the incompetence of the trump administration, and are\nworking to present information that will lead to high level firings and, ultimately, impeachment.\ni’m writing these things so that when/if these things happen there will be a public record beforehand.\nthese are truly baffling and horrifying times, as we have an incompetent president who is essentially owned by a foreign power.\n-moby\nSo, ummmm….does Moby know something we don’t? Guess only time will tell.\n[h/t NME ] \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:48:11.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
