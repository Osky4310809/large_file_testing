The final two films in George Gently are set in 1970, with change in the air, Cold War political paranoia and looming industrial unrest. \nOne film sees Gently involved in an investigation that may be a miscarriage of justice and the second has him giving evidence against corrupt police officers at the Old Bailey.

We’re a very happy and close company, and working with such friends is a joy. \n“I’m excited at being able to bring the series to a proper finale.” \nITV’s Doc Martin has been on screens for more than 12 years but Clunes, 55 – who portrays the brilliant blood-fearing GP – has told Radio Times the show will conclude after series nine in 2018. \nFollowers will be upset that the series is nearing its end. But the cast are far from down-hearted – they thought the show would wrap up after the series seven party.
