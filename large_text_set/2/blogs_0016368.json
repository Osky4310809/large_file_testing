The average driver apparently spends 86 hours a year stuck in congestion. \nNew York took four of the top 10 spots, far more than any other city. I-95 East from Exit 70A to Exit 7A was number three, Fifth Avenue southbound from 120th Street to 40th Street was number seven and NJ-495 Eastbound from the I-95 Junction to 12th Avenue through the Lincoln Tunnel was number eight. \nCorridors in Chicago took the number two and number 10 spots on the list, while streets in Boston, Los Angeles, Austin and Philadelphia filled out the rest of the list. \nOverall, drivers in New York spent an average of 89 hours last year sitting in traffic, the second highest amount of time in North America and the third across the globe, behind only Moscow and Los Angeles. \nStreets in New York City had the highest daytime congestion rate in the country among the cities INRIX looked at, and traffic speed was 8.23 miles per hour — significantly slower than the average pace of the 2016 New York City marathon winner Ghirmay Ghebreslassie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:24:10.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
