Sgt. Ian Nichol of the Toronto police financial crimes unit says the woman eventually realized she’d been had.\nHe says she was then was contacted by the same suspects posing as agents with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations and the United Nations, who told her she had been awarded $22 million by Nigerian courts in restitution as a victim of fraud.\nNichol says the suspects convinced the woman to send more money to cover fees, taxes and other expenses, prompting her to sell her condo and turn over about $410,000 more over about seven years.\nRelated Ontario man jailed — again — for running ‘deplorable’ fake cancer charity scam From romance scams to fake lottery winnings: The top 10 frauds Canadians need to watch out for RCMP in B.C. warn of fraudster preying on Vancouver women looking for love He says they used the names of real FBI and UN employees and provided fake news releases and court documents to bolster their lies.\nPolice aren’t likely to track down the person or people responsible in this case, but hope the woman’s experience serves as a warning to be cautious online, Nichol said, noting that people may be more susceptible than they think.\n“This is a person who held a responsible administrative job — she’s no dummy,” Nichol said.\n“Typically, many of our victims in these cases have some form of vulnerability.
