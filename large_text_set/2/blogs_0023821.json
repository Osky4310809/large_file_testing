After the bootcamp, they can decide to either get a Masters degree from the varsity or come back home to start their businesses. \n“This rare opportunity will enable them manage their business and employees because it would get to a point where those who are only skilled at coding would retire like footballers while those who upped their coding and leadership skill remain relevant.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:39:00.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
