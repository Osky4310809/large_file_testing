One source told SSNHQ today that Koeman's accusations were \"absolute nonsense\". Upgrade to Sky Sports now and get 12 months for just Â£18 per month! \n\"To suggest that we ignored the advice of the our medical team is total rubbish,\" the source said. \"Mr Koeman needs to check his facts before he says such things.\" \nWe understand O'Neill tried to contact Koeman on several occasions before Christmas after their latest fall-out. However, Koeman failed to return his calls. \nBehind the scenes the FAI are frustrated that by what they see as Koeman's unwillingness to talk to them, whilst being willing to discuss his concerns with the media. Highlights of the group D World Cup Qualifier between Republic of Ireland against Wales at the Aviva stadium \nThey also feel they are getting the blame for McCarthy's continuing hamstring problems, which have, until Friday, all happened whilst players for Everton. \nKoeman said on Wednesday: \"It was a final decision against the [judgement of the] medical staff of Ireland and also against the medical staff of Everton. And there are two people responsible for that. \n\"One is the player by himself. Finally, if he says, 'Yes. I'm fit', okay, but even the player needs protection from the manager and, once again, they didn't give that protection to the player.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T15:36:54.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
