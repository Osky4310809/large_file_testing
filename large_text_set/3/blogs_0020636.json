ET caught up with Grey’s star Justin Chambers, who has played Alex since the series debuted in 2005, at PaleyFest in Los Angeles on Sunday, where he revealed where he stands on Meredith ( Ellen Pompeo ) and Alex’s romantic outlook. “I think anything is possible,” Chambers told ET, referring to their ship name, \"Merlex.\" “I think friends can become lovers like that, that’s possible too.” \nChambers explained why he was OK with where Alex and Meredith currently stand and further elaborated on his preference for them to remain in the friend zone. \nRELATED: 'Grey's Anatomy's' Jesse Williams and Sarah Drew on That 'Japril' Hookup “I’m very comfortable with them being platonic -- like brother and sister, and friends. I think that suits them better,” the 45-year-old actor said, leaving the door slightly ajar if a romance were to spark up. “But hey, who knows? Nobody knows how things go, you know? I was friends with my wife before we started dating.” “They have been friends a long time though,” Chambers continued. “Alex and [Meredith] have come up together and I don’t know, [it’d be] a little weird, but anything is possible.” \nComplicating matters is Alex’s complex relationship with his ex, Jo Wilson ( Camilla Luddington ), with whom he’s been on the outs since beating up Andrew DeLuca ( Giancarlo Giannotti ) and nearly finding himself behind bars. \nRELATED: 'Grey's Anatomy' Picked Up for Season 13 “I’m excited to see what happens with him and ‘Jolex,’” Chambers said of their unclear future. “I think they really love each other. I know they have a lot of obstacles to go through but it will be interesting to see what conflicts, fires they can put out.” “Merlex and then Jolex, we’ll see what happens,” he teased.
