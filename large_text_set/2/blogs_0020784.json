You might be thinking, “OMG, cool! Let’s go live there since we’ve messed this one up with pollution and stupidity!” Twitter \nBut, well, the newly discovered planets are still super far away. They’re about 235 trillion miles (40 light-years) outside of our solar system. \n— Jenna Ruddock (@natlsciservice) February 22, 2017 \nNow, I know what you’re going to ask next. \nSeriously, I know where this is going. Twitter Twitter \nYou want to know if there are aliens up there, right? I know I’m wondering it. And lots of folks are thinking the same. Twitter \nAnd the answer is… well… I’m not really sure, but the NASA people are HYPED. \nThomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a press release , \nThis discovery could be a significant piece in the puzzle of finding habitable environments, places that are conducive to life. \nAnswering the question ‘are we alone’ is a top science priority and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal. \nThat’s the kinda quote that makes you say “ho-ly sh t fam, we’re not alone, maybe!” Twitter \nBut in all seriousness, this is a really neat, groundbreaking discovery. Space is amazing. Yay NASA!
