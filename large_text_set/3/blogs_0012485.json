In this case, researchers from the University of Bern have been working on a robot that performs the most delicate and potentially damaging step: drilling into the skull at the precise location and depth to give access to the right part of the cochlea. Yes, they have special drill bits just for getting through skull and tissue. The iii and iv parts of the figure are proposed but untested further opportunities for robotic implantation procedures. \nThe team’s paper, published today in Science Robotics , reports the success of using the robot for drilling purposes, and proposes further applications, such as the actual implantation processes. \nIn the meantime, they use the drilling process as a platform to prove that the robot can hook into surgery planning systems, stereo vision, live detection of tissue types, and so on. Other microsurgeries could also benefit from the technology. \nIf the robocalypse comes, they won’t need a treatment plan to drill into your brain. Until that happens, robots like this could provide some much-needed consistency in surgical procedures that, like this one, exist at the boundary of what humans are capable of. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:53:35.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
