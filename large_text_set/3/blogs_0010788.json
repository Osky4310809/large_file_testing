Spreading leafy fronds over a white canvas and reflecting blossoms across an unseen divide , a series of botanical collages embrace the true glory of arrangement. Composed in celebration of International Women's Day , Ayala Tal took to heart the event's inclusive message by incorporating lush and gender-neutral imagery of botanicals. \nHer 2D collages rest against a clean, blank surface, stoic and gleaming. The Tel Aviv-based artist's \"botanical jewels\" speak to the attraction all humans have to natural beauty.
