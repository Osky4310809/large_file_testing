(Lloyd Fox / Baltimore Sun) \nLouthan Distilling and Zeke’s Coffee \nSometimes, a collaboration is simply a result of proximity. \nThat’s the case with Louthan Distilling and Zeke’s Coffee Liqueur, the new product from the two Baltimore companies that share a warehouse in the Beverly Hills neighborhood. \nA couple years ago, the father-daughter team of Len and Kelsey Louthan tried to infuse their corn whiskey with coffee. The results weren’t ready for the public. \n“I guess to be generous, we were on a learning curve,” said Len Louthan. “There’s a lot of failures on the way to making something good.” \nEnter Whitney Weber, an equipment manager at Zeke’s who began tinkering with Louthan’s recipe. First, he tried adding hot-brewed coffee to the production, but the flavor turned sour. Weber’s eventual solution was to add ground coffee straight into the whiskey, and then run it through a filter to remove the coffee sediment . \nThe trial-and-error process of different volumes of water, whiskey, coffee and simple syrup eventually led to the 80-proof liqueur, which uses Louthan’s white whiskey base and Zeke’s Market Blend, a mixture of Ethiopian and Guatemalan coffees. The latter’s subtle chocolate notes brought a nice balance to the corn whiskey without losing its alcoholic kick, Weber said. \n“If you’re getting a liqueur, you want it to have a bite of liquor in it,” Weber said. “You don’t want it to be all coffee tasting. It really wouldn’t be that fun.” \nThe liqueur is made in small batches and sold accordingly — it’s currently only available on weekends at the 32nd Street Farmers’ Market in 375 - milliliter bottles. \nBut what’s the best way to use the liqueur? It’s the most common question Len Louthan receives. While the initial inspiration was to make a White Russian cocktail (“I’m just a ‘Big Lebowski’ fan, I guess,” said Weber), Louthan said he most often hears about dessert. \n“There are people who make drinks and stuff, but more people have said, ‘We just pour it over ice cream, and we love it.’” \nFor Zeke’s president Thomas Rhodes, who isn’t much of a drinker, the collaboration represents hometown pride. \n“My personal gratification is seeing Zeke’s on other quality products in Baltimore,” Rhodes said. \nLouthan Distilling and Zeke’s Coffee Liqueur ($24) is sold at the 32nd Street Farmers’ Market in Waverly from 7 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. louthandistilling.com ; zekescoffee.com . Union Craft Brewing & Vent Coffee Roasters Lloyd Fox / Baltimore Sun \nUnion Craft Brewing updated their most recent Pajama Pants oatmeal stout recipe with coffee from Vent Coffee Roasters, the one-woman operation by Baltimore's Sarah Walker. \nUnion Craft Brewing updated their most recent Pajama Pants oatmeal stout recipe with coffee from Vent Coffee Roasters, the one-woman operation by Baltimore's Sarah Walker. (Lloyd Fox / Baltimore Sun) \nUnion Craft Brewing and Vent Coffee Roasters \nHampden’s Union Craft Brewing is no stranger to coffee collaborations. A few years ago, with the help of Ceremony Coffee Roasters, Union debuted two coffee-flavored beers — AM Gold and Pajama Pants. \nThey were happy with the results, said co-founder and head brewer Kevin Blodger, but when it came to this year’s iterations, the proudly Baltimore company wanted to work with a roaster in the city. \nLocal bartender Amie Ward connected Union with Sarah Walker, the one-woman operation behind Vent Coffee Roasters. \nEven though this was Walker’s first collaboration with a beer company, Blodger said he was impressed with Walker’s extensive knowledge (she moved to the West Coast years ago to learn the complexities of coffee before returning here) and attention to detail. \n“It’s a small little roastery, but what she does is awesome,” Blodger said. “Meeting her and tasting the coffee, and just hearing her story, let us know that she’s on the same path that Union is.” \nThe 8 percent alcohol Pajama Pants is a variation of Union’s Snow Pants, a hoppy stout that blends well with Vent’s El Salvador coffee, which balances nutty and sweet flavors. \nWhile Walker enjoys Pajama Pants, she was most excited to work on AM Gold, a smooth and accessible 5 percent alcohol American cream ale. \n“I had never had a lighter coffee beer,” said Walker, who is also the in-house roaster at downtown’s Argosy Cafe. “I wasn’t expecting that.” \nAfter a series of tastings (called “cuppings” in the coffee world), Union and Vent decided on an Ethiopian Guji coffee, which provided the floral and lemon notes necessary to balance the soft flavors of the cream ale, Walker said. She knew they had a winner after a taste-test with some tough critics. \n“I have a couple of friends that are not fans of light-roasted coffee, which we used for the AM Gold, and they liked it better than the stout,” she said. “I was like, ‘Yes! I’m going to win you over soon.’” \nUnion and Vent expressed their appreciation for each other’s crafts, a running theme throughout all of these collaborations. Given the positive reception from the local drinking community, Blodger expects the two worlds to continue to overlap in new ways. \n“I’m hoping to incorporate [other coffees] into more kinds of beer,” he said. “For a long time, it was just coffee stouts and coffee porters. You see across the spectrum now.” \nAM Gold and Pajama Pants are available on draft at Union Craft Brewing’s taproom, 1700 Union Ave. in Hampden, and other select bars. unioncraftbrewing.com ; ventcoffeeroasters.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:13:40.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
