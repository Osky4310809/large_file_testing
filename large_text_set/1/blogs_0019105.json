Only 100 bottles of Ray’s Reserve will be sold, each costing $250. \nWhile the price per bottle is rather steep, Bloomquist says all of the sales profits will be used to fund Daytoon’s nonprofit organization, It’s My Time To Shine. \n“The profits will fund the Time to Shine Scholarship & Internship Program for Women which will help female students pay for community college,” Bloomquist said. “Recipients of the scholarship will be required to work a summer internship in Baltimore or Greensboro, N.C. The organization will be fully operational in 2018 and is accepting applications.” \nThumbnail photo via Mark J.
