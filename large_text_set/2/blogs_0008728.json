Eustis St. since 1952, practicing a dying craft to give new life to shoes and boots. He started out there when it was Moore’s Shoe Hospital and bought the business in 1976, renaming it Dunston’s Shoe Hospital.\nRobert Dunston works on a boot at Dunston's Shoe Hospital in Eustis.

(Jerry Fallstrom/Orlando Sentinel) He started repairing shoes after he finished the sixth grade at Lloyd Moore’s earlier location around the corner on Magnolia Avenue. He has no desire to retire.\n“I can’t sit around the house,” he said with a chuckle, chewing on a toothpick. “Can’t be doing those honey-do jobs.”\nBeing his own boss in a one-man business — a sole proprietor, so to speak — has its advantages. If arthritis or other ailments begin to wear him down, he takes a seat in his favorite chair near the window and props up his feet.\n“When I get to aching, I’ll take a rest,” he said.\nRobert Dunston takes a break from repairing shoes at Dunston's Shoe Hospital.

(Jerry Fallstrom/Orlando Sentinel) He and his wife, Dorothy, 78, have been married 57 years and have three daughters, six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nHe has a loyal base of thrifty customers who’d rather have their shoes fixed than buy new ones. He’s old fashioned — customers have to stop by to see if their shoes are ready because the business doesn’t have a phone. He said a phone would get in the way of getting work done.\nAnna Figueroa, 79, of Altoona, stopped by on a recent day to pick up a pair of shoes, but he hadn’t gotten to them yet. No worries, Figueroa said.\n“He’s such a nice man,” she said. “How can you be mad about that?”\nHe had them ready the next day, she said.\nShoes abound at Dunston's Shoe Hospital in Eustis.

(Jerry Fallstrom/Orlando Sentinel) Dunston said there’s nobody in line to take over his business after he’s mended his last shoe. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a 30-percent decline in shoe-repair shops between 2001 and 2014, down to 1,018 stores in the U.S, according to news reports.\nDunston goes at his own pace, getting around the shop with the help of a cane.\n“I stay plenty busy — busy as I want to be, to tell you the truth.”\njfallstrom@orlandosentinel.com or 352-742-5916\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-589c6dac/turbine/os-jfallstrom-1486646767-snap-photo", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-589c6e3d/turbine/os-jfallstrom-1486646911-snap-photo", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-589c6d2a/turbine/os-jfallstrom-1486646634-snap-photo", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-589e0a11/turbine/os-lk-robert-dunston-shoe-repairman-20170131"], "published": "2017-02-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:01:30.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
