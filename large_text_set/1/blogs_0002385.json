Reuters Even the RBI on November 8 statement said, \"Any person who is unable to exchange or deposit the specified banknotes in their bank accounts on or before December 30, 2016 shall be given an opportunity to do so at specified offices of the Reserve Bank or such other facility until a later date as may be specified by the Reserve Bank.\"\nThe central bank on December 31 designated its five offices -- Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Nagpur -- to exchange defunct currency notes post 50-day demonetisation period that ended on December 30. \nRBI has imposed conditions for availing extended facility for note exchanges. It had said that NRIs and Indians returning from abroad will have to physically show the junked 500 and 1,000 rupee notes to customs officials at the airport and get a declaration form stamped before they can deposit the demonetised currency in RBI during the grace period. also see", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T04:41:07.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
