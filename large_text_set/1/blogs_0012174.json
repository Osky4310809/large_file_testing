If you crocheted your snowflake using thread or yarn that responds well to blocking, i.e. cotton or wool, block the snowflake. If you used synthetic yarn such as acrylic, there is no need for blocking. My sample snowflake has not been blocked, but it should be. \nUse the snowflake as you wish; it makes a fantastic embellishment or applique. Enjoy!
