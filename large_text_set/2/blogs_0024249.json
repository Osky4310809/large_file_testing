ATLANTA—We begin our tour in Stamford, Connecticut, where folks seem to have too much time on their hands. From the AP : \nLindsay says their home has been vandalized multiple times. She says Stamford authorities have failed to properly investigate and she won't remove the slur until they do.The city issued a blight citation, which carries a $100 daily fine. NAACP representatives on Monday called for a full investigation, including canvassing the neighborhood and posting a patrol car to make sure the couple is safe. The city's director of public safety says an investigation is underway.   This is why people hate \"government.\" This, right here. These people are the victims of a repeated crime about which the city can't (or won't) do dick. So, in the place of doing dick about the crime, the city fines them for not removing the evidence of the crime fast enough. Would you like to count the numbers of different kind of sense this doesn't make? Does Stamford fine beating victims for walking around in public with unsightly facial wounds? Most Popular Moving along to Tennessee, where the brawl over marriage equality goes on, courtesy of a legislator named Mae Beavers, who appears to have beamed in from 17 th century Salem. She likes her \"Whereas's,\" does Ms. Beavers : \nWHEREAS, the decision in Obergefell purporting to overturn natural marriage flies in the face of reality, the created order, and the law of nature, just as if the Court were to claim authority to strike down the law of gravity or other natural laws. At this point, given the respect for science present in the current administration, I'm surprised the House hasn't passed a bill repealing the law of gravity. (The airlines will benefit from the competition. Invisible hand!) After all, it's all but repealed hydrology, physics, and climatology as regards the climate crisis. Anyway, in her time in the legislature, Ms. Beavers has been busy as, well, you know…Anti-choice, pro-gun and, as we see, very pro-Mark of Cain. \nAs introduced, requires the department of safety to print the language \"NON U.S. CITIZEN\" or \"ALIEN\" on driver licenses, permits, or other forms of identification issued or renewed for a temporary period to persons who are not United States citizens and not lawful permanent residents of the United States. (H/T to Friend o'the Blog Thomas Hulley for the tip on Ms. Beavers.)

(Why didn't the vandals take that handle , I ask you.) You may be sensing a kind of beaver theme building here. From The Review : \nBut even Grimm will admit he's concerned that could change, all because of an industrial history that has left nearby ground contaminated with trichloroethylene, an industrial solvent that has been linked to birth defects and a laundry list of other health problems. The DEP late last year found extremely elevated levels of trichloroethylene, known as TCE, in several \"test wells\" located in the area behind the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe and McDonald's. The water pulled from the six wells on the municipal authority's property near the Ohio River is clean. However, the test wells located less than a mile away are still part of the same watershed used by Vanport's system, a fact that has prompted the DEP to enact a response that will cost a significant amount of money. In a legal notice published in early January, the DEP admitted the TCE problem \"poses an ongoing threat to the Vanport Township Municipal Authority water supply system.\"   I admit, I'm fascinated by the technology of stripping the poisons by blowing the air through the water before it goes out to the homes. And I'm sure that EPA administrator Scott Pruitt will get right on this , just as soon as the checks clear.   (H/t to Friend o'The Blog Matthew Gulish for passing the word on this one.) Let's move on up to Iowa, where an ambitious omadhaun in the legislature has found a form of affirmative action that makes all his lights shine. Let's remember who all the real victims are. From the Iowa Starting Line blog: \nThe legislation proposes that a \"person shall not be hired as a professor or instructor member of the faculty at such an institution if the person's political party affiliation on the date of hire would cause the percentage of faculty belonging to one political party to exceed by ten percent the percentage of faculty belonging to the other political party.\" The Secretary of State's office would be directed to provide voter registration lists to the colleges so that new job applicants' party affiliation could be checked before the hiring process gets underway. Graciously, Chelgren allows for people registered as No Party to slip through the process without facing the litmus test. Most Popular Quotas! We must have quotas! When did Republicans become a protected class? I have to start reading these memos that are piling up. Related Story These Documents Are Damning, & the Senate Knows It And we conclude, as is our wont, in the great state of Oklahoma, where Blog Official Scott Pruitt Farewell Banquet Chairman Friedman of the Plains brings us this week's reading from the Book Of Armaments, courtesy of KFOR-TV : \n\"I have a hard time seeing Jesus saying, 'yep, carry a gun,'\" Rep. Emily Virgin said in the debate. \nAn audio recording captured the exchange between representatives Jeff Coody and Emily Virgin. \nRep. Coody was introducing his bill that would allow people to carry loaded handguns in their vehicles without a permit. \nCoody said it's his God-given right to carry a gun. \n\"I'm certainly not an expert on scripture, but where is it in the Bible that it is a God-given right to carry a gun?\" Virgin asked. \n\"Well, since guns weren't invented when the bible was written, I would have to refer you to Luke chapter 22 where Jesus himself told Peter that if he has a sword, take it with him,\" Rep. Coody said. Preachers agog! \nSome, like Rev. Lori Walke of Mayflower Congregational United Church of Christ, were offended. \"I don't know what Bible he's reading but mine calls Jesus the Prince of Peace, not the prince of pistols. I strongly encourage him to shore up his constitutional argument because he does not have a scriptural one,\" Rev. Walke said. Coody was undaunted. \n\"Even though the Bible doesn't specifically address guns, a lot of people want to know, well what did Jesus say about weapons? God expects us to defend ourselves,\" Rep. Coody said. Rep. Virgin argued against the bill, citing Oklahoma's high rate of domestic violence. \"I really don`t think this is a funny topic,\" Rep. Virgin said. But the laughter in the room didn't stop. And now, the punchline. \nThe bill passed out of committee 11-4. This is your democracy, America.
