If they were to, in the end, eliminate the entitlement and put it down, I think it would destroy the presidency,” he said. \nObamacare allowed states to expand the insurance program for the poor known as Medicaid, which is funded by both the states and the federal government. More than a million Americans were added to the Medicaid rolls through Obamacare. The House seeks to freeze the expansion of Medicaid expansion in 2020 and eventually phase it out. \nKrauthammer said that’s not a viable political prospect.

They’re gonna try a more serious conservative entitlement, but if they were to ask the administration to give, in the end, to fall on their sword on this, I think it would be disastrous on the part of the conservatives,” he contended. \nKrauthammer noted that once an entitlement becomes part of society, it is hard to take it away. \n“I think after what Obama did there is a entitlement that is now accepted. But in the end there’s no way that they’re gonna consolidate a loss of the entitlement,” he said. \nKrauthammer said that while House passage of the Obamacare overhaul is assured, so, too, are changes to the proposal unveiled Monday night.

And they’re now gonna transmute it into something different.” \nThe changes may be more cosmetic than substantive, he predicted. \n“But the entitlement will stay, there’s no way to ratchet it back,” he added. “And the conservatives are gonna have to swallow that in the end, because otherwise it collapses.” \nAn indication of the fight to come emerged Monday when four GOP senators from states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare said that they will not support a replacement plan unless those who enrolled are protected. \n“We are concerned that any poorly implemented or poorly timed change in the current funding structure in Medicaid could result in a reduction in access to life-saving health care services,” said a letter signed by Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Cory Gardner of Colorado. \n“The February 10th draft proposal from the House does not meet the test of stability for individuals currently enrolled in the program and we will not support a plan that does not include stability for Medicaid expansion populations or flexibility for states,” wrote the senators. \n“Any changes made to how Medicaid is financed through the state and federal governments should be coupled with significant new flexibility so they can efficiently and effectively manage their Medicaid programs to best meet their own needs,” they added. “We also believe a gradual transition is needed to ensure states have the time to successfully implement these new changes.” What do you think?
