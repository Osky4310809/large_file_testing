But he quickly apologized after his Twitter followers sent him the video, which he said he hadn’t seen before commenting.\nLet me see if I have this right. @lenadunham child molestor Woody Allen, sex with a minor, Roman Polanski, rapist, But Milo is the problem?\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\nSchilling engaged with his followers for approximately 40 minutes before being sent a link to the video, after which he immediately reversed his position.\nOk, pretty important piece of news, and commentary, I went into this discussion without. That’s a whole different ball of wax to be sure. https://t.co/qsvBiqfLWs\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\nUPDATE! I had NO idea of the video/audio of Milo’s interview which he defends and hides the identity of pedophiles. There’s no circumstance\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\nIn any setting ever where protection of a molester is appropriate and IMO legal? But I apologize if it appeared in any way I was ‘defending”\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\nthat sort of commentary. I’ll accept any and all abuse thrown my way for not thoroughly going through ALL the material before responding.\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\nSchilling kept his word and did accept criticism from his followers. He also, in a few cases, returned fire.\n@NewsGlue No, “Schilling” jumped into the conversation prior to having all the commentary. Thereby making a HUGE mistake.\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\n@stillwinning2 I do think it’s awesome how apologizing is known to the left as “backtracking”. Good stuff\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\n@CadillacSwanger Not defending, merely stating that unlike your candy ass I didn’t curl up in the fetal position when I heard it\n— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) February 21, 2017\n[ image via screengrab ]\n–\nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833842371741749253", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fcurt-schilling-initially-defends-breitbart-colleague-yiannopoulos-then-apologizes-after-watching-video%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/curt-schilling.jpg&description=Curt%20Schilling%20Initially%20Defends%20Breitbart%20Colleague%20Yiannopoulos%2C%20Then%20Apologizes%20After%20Watching%20Video", "https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833883707442343942", "https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833851676364771328", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fcurt-schilling-initially-defends-breitbart-colleague-yiannopoulos-then-apologizes-after-watching-video%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "https://twitter.com/stillwinning2", "https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833884064113422338", "https://twitter.com/CadillacSwanger", "https://twitter.com/NewsGlue", "https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833851894875447298", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833874611083284480", "https://twitter.com/lenadunham", "https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833850551796432900", "http://twitter.com/joe_depaolo", "https://t.co/qsvBiqfLWs", "https://twitter.com/gehrig38/status/833851345073483777"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:05:05.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
