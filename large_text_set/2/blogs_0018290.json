The publisher defended the deal at the time, saying \"We do not and never have condoned discrimination or hate speech in any form.\"\nCheck out photos of Yiannolpoulos \n\nThe book cancellation was announced shortly after the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) disinvited Yiannopoulos as a speaker over a video that recently surfaced showing Yiannopoulos commenting on pedophilia .\nYiannopoulos has been on a speaking tour to promote the book in recent months. Some of his appearances were heavily rebuked by critics and protesters. A Yiannopoulos speaking engagement at the University of California, Berkeley sparked campuswide protests earlier this month.\nPresident Donald Trump scolded the university and suggested federal funds could be pulled if the school \"does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view.\"\nIn response to the comments that led to Monday's events, Yiannopoulos issued an apology on his Facebook page:\n\"I'm partly to blame. My own experiences as a victim led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous,\" he writes. \"But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, 'advocacy.' I deeply regret that.
