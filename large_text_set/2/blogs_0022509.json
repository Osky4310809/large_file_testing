Cummings shoots Hibs into the lead \nShinnie started on the bench but came on after just three minutes because of an injury to Chris Humphrey and produced a beautiful pass to split the away defence, allowing the prolific Cummings to slot a shot into the Hearts net. \nHibs almost doubled their lead but Hearts goalkeeper Jack Hamilton did well to deny John McGinn and Shinnie put the rebound over. \nBut the hosts were well on top and added to their advantage moments later, Holt finding the net after Cummings had held the ball up well and then conjured up a clever reverse pass. \nJamie Walker wasted a Hearts opportunity after the break and the visitors found themselves three-down just after the hour. \nShinnie let fly from the edge of the box and the previously impressive Hamilton appeared to be at fault as the ball found its way into the net. Grant Holt doubled the Hibernian lead \nThe Ladbrokes Premiership side looked beaten but five minutes later were handed a lifeline when referee Steven McLean ruled that Hibs defender Darren McGregor had fouled Goncalves in the box. \nHome keeper Ofir Marciano saved the striker's penalty and then the rebound, but the former St Mirren forward got the break of the ball and forced it over the line at the third attempt. \nThe match swung from end to end in the closing stages but there were no further goals, although McGregor nodded a Cummings free-kick into the net, only to see had been flagged offside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:21:12.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
