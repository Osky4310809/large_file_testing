Obviously, post the successful outing, the actress must have expected everything to turn to her favour. However, this isn’t the case. \nThe actress lost out on a role in Thugs Of Hindostan. Speaking to BollywoodLife exclusively, the actress said, “Thugs Of Hindostan ke baare mein kya batau. I am not playing that role. Main chahti thi film mujhe mile (What can I say about Thugs Of Hindostan? I am not playing that role. I wanted to bag that film.)” \n(Also read: Dangal star Fatima Sana Shaikh&#8217;s fangirl moment with Shah Rukh Khan is creepy and hilarious ) \nWhile the actress had only this much to say about her losing out on the role, reports suggest there was a reason why she was dropped. It is being speculated that Fatima lost out on the role as it requires the actress to romance Aamir Khan and since she has played his daughter in Dangal, it might look inappropriate. \nThugs Of Hindostan is being touted to be India’s answer to Pirates Of The Carribean. It apparently also stars Amitabh Bachchan. The film’s leading lady hasn’t been finalised yet though names like Alia Bhatt, Vaani Kapoor and Kriti Sanon were being considered for the same.
