Never one to mince words, Charles Barkley has been particularly vocal in his belief that LeBron needs to stop “whining” to the media. \nLeBron quickly fired back with a searing missive pointing out Barkley’s hypocrisy by chronicling much of his questionable behavior during his playing days, to which the longtime TNT personality replied that he was essentially just doing his job and isn’t in the business of making friends with the players he comments on.
