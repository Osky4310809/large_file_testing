She says she expressed a dissenting opinion to an administrator. \nShe defended her stance in front of the school board Tuesday night. \nMusil will finish teaching for the remainder of the school year. Meantime, students and parents says their fight for her isn’t over. \nDistrict 208 Supt. Kevin Skinkis says the three-hour demonstration at the school was peaceful. \nHe says he and other administrators met with some of the students involved and had a productive conversation about communication and acceptance of diversity in the future. \nSandra Torres Sandra Torres is a general assignment reporter for CBS 2.
