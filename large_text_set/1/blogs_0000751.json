Well, not everyone I guess, but the trailers are fun to watch at least, even if they’re as cringe-worthy as they are unsexy. After dropping the latest full-length trailer for Fifty Shades Darker early in December, we’re now treated (tempted? tantalized?) to a shorter TV spot that is no less suspenseful.\nThe short skips the reconciliation backstory (we all know the drill – on-again, off-again couple) and this time focuses on the crazy ex-girlfriend plotline (also familiar with that one).
