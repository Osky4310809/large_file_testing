Not wanting for the loss to overwhelm him, Will found a focus by putting the engine of his friend Dev's 2010 Fireblade into his MK Indy. As Dev wanted to race at club level it seemed fitting that the engine has made its way to the track.\nMonths of planning and research finally got the engine in the MK, now with 185hp and weighing only 480kg with half a tank of fuel. A couple of trick upgrades included a Woolich racing ECU, custom loom and EFI map allowing for flat upshifts, launch control and a couple of options to boast about to his mates. \n18 months since the build began Will took the Devastator for its first track outing at Cadwell Park, and apparently it was only after he came back to the pits could he fully appreciate what he and his friend had built. Congratulations Will on this fantastic commemoration to your friend Dev, the Devastator is our Reader's Car of The Week. Read the full thread here .
