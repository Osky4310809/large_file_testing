Undercover Boss ' Wednesday, January 4, episode focused on the CFO of Painting With a Twist. Speaking of twists, this episode of CBS’ deception-based workplace reality show certainly caught Us by surprise, and even had Us reaching for the tissue box…and another glass of pinot! PHOTOS: Stars Who Were Fired From Jobs \nRenee Became \"Savannah\"…With Bad Teeth \nThe episode kicked off as we met Renee Maloney, cofounder and CFO of Painting With a Twist, a company specializing in fun, wine-filled group painting lessons. With over 300 franchise locations and more than $40 million in annual revenue, Renee was ready to check in on her rapidly growing business as her granola, single mom alter ego, \"Savannah.\" Renee’s husband wasn’t such a big fan of her new look — which included “smoker teeth” with bleached hair and eyebrows — saying she’d have to “sleep with the dogs” if she continued looking that way. PHOTOS: Stars Who Were Born Rich \nUndercover in San Antonio \nRenee’s first stop on her Painting With a Twist National Tour began in San Antonio, Texas, where she was tasked with helping teach a painting class with young up-and-comer Maci. Instantly flustered, Renee admitted, “I failed art.” She tried to lighten the mood in the class with a “blonde” joke that was greeted with an uncomfortable silence. During a one-on-one, Maci and Renee began to bond over their shared family sorrows. Maci revealed through tears that her father left their family and “started his new life…on Christmas Day.” Renee, whose own father left her mother for their babysitter, connected with Maci and shared a raw moment.

These Celebrities Can’t Stand Each Other Off-Screen \nGoing Incognito in Rockwall \nRenee then headed over to Rockwall, Texas, where she met Bree, a manager-in-training. Bree, who prided herself on having created several successful paintings for the company, griped to “Savannah” about the pitfalls of the business. Bree admitted, “The downfall to creating art is that it’s not something we are compensated for.… That’s the one thing I would change.” Renee seemed to take this to heart saying to the camera, “That’s something I really need to look at.” \nRenee was then tasked with creating her own original painting. Behind Renee’s back, Bree slammed the piece, calling it “a little bit like a doodle that you do as a kid.” Uh-oh, she dissed the boss! Bree then connected with “Savannah” when Bree revealed that prior to this job, “I had no money to feed my kids.… I took a job at a restaurant just so I could bring home scraps.” \nRenee Became a Factory Inspector \nRenee then stopped by Louisiana to check out a giant warehouse full of boxes. She was tasked with joining shift manager Calvin in a thorough inspection of boxes and boxes full of canvases. When an exhausted Renee (dressed as Savannah) asked, “When’s lunch?” an annoyed Calvin responded, “Lunch is when you finish.” When Calvin revealed to Renee that he was starting his own vending machine company to provide for his 7-year-old daughter, Renee was touched. On the spot, she offered him $5,000 toward his business, and $10,000 toward his daughter’s education.

But luckily for her, he clearly didn’t recognize her with the new ‘do. Steve instantly criticized the way “Savannah” worked the front desk, saying, “Savannah was greeting customers.… She was very quiet.” He continued to complain about her soft-spoken demeanor, saying, “She’s sucking the life out of me.” Ouch. \nHe then complained to the CFO of his company about having to pay out of pocket for his own social media classes. When Renee noticed that Steve custom-stamped the back of each of his canvases, she cringed. Annoyed with the lack of uniformity that she expected from her business, Renee said to the camera, “The stamping in the back of the canvas kind of got me in the gut.… They’re not just his customers — they’re everybody’s customers.” \nRenee Gave Maci Scholarship Money \nAfter Renee revealed her identity to Maci, Steve and Bree, they were all clearly in shock. She then offered each of them, individually, some seriously heartwarming prizes for their hard work, hardships and dedication. Renee said to Maci, “My dad left.… It makes me sad that you’re so burdened.… I wanna give you $25,000 to pay off your school debt.” On top of that, she threw in $10,000 for rent, and another $25,000 to finish school. They both cried. We cried. Tears were all over the place.
