The chief creative officer of Calvin Klein , who designed couture during his previous stint at Dior , will launch made-to-measure clothing and accessories services at Calvin Klein on April 1. The range, called Calvin Klein By Appointment, pledges to offer unique pieces, previously only made for celebrity clientele, to CK fans looking for a special slice of Simons’s creativity for themselves. “Calvin Klein is not only about iconic underwear and jeans—it’s about so much more,” said Simons in a release. \nThe line was announced on Saturday evening across Calvin Klein’s social media channels with a series of 15 women photographed in custom pieces by Willy Vanderperre , and styled by Olivier Rizzo. The cast of CK models include actress Millie Bobby Brown, Abbey Lee Kershaw, Kiki Willems, Linesy Montero, Jamie Bochert, and Julia Nobis among others, each wearing a different piece, from Nobis’s tulle skirt to Bochert’s floral separates. \nThe imagery, meant to reflect the variety of American women and the trends of the ’20s through today, was rolled out simultaneously with the end of Women’s Marches around the world, in which more than 2 million women and men peacefully protested for equality. Calvin Klein touched on the movement obliquely, with one of the campaign shots showing Kershaw wearing a draped skirt in an American-flag print. Said Simons, “Calvin Klein By Appointment 1-14 [the name of the campaign] is very much about celebrating the American woman and American fashion.” \nCreative director Pieter Mulier, who worked as Simons’s right hand at Dior, echoed the designer’s sentiments. “It is driven by character; it’s about a woman feeling empowered and being her own person in what she wears.” \nThe imagery also provided a hint as to what Simons’s vision of Calvin Klein looks like: sophisticated, slinky, sexy, ineffably cool, and with a little something for everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:58:43.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
