But it’s always been a family business, and some recent decisions made by Jeanie have upset two of her brothers. \nJim and Johnny Buss had a plan to oust Jeanie as president and controlling owner, but according to the Los Angeles Times , her attorneys went to court and were successful in shutting them down. Attorneys for Jeanie Buss sought a temporary restraining order in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday to prevent the brothers from holding a meeting next week to elect a new board of directors for the team that didn’t include her. In order to be the controlling owner, she has to be a director. The brothers withdrew the request in court Friday after Jeanie Buss asked for the restraining order. A probate court trial to resolve the matter is scheduled for May. \nJeanie shook up the front office two weeks ago , when she replaced her brother Jim and GM Mitch Kupchak by giving Magic Johnson control of basketball operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:52:05.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
