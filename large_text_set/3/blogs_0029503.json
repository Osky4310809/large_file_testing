The former president did acknowledge that health care premiums are on the rise under Obamacare but said \"the vast majority\" have not seen premiums skyrocket.\n\"While it's true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all,\" he said,\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer pushed back against Obama's comments.\n\"President Obama must be feeling the time is up,\" he said.\nSpicer said Obama was downplaying the goals of the law and the criticisms that have surrounded it.\nThe House of Representatives plans to vote Friday on the American Health Care Act, the House GOP leadership plan to replace Obamacare, which Trump supports. Ryan and the White House, however, may not have enough votes to pass the bill through the House, according to reports .\nThe post Obama Comes Out to Defend His Health Care Law appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T21:05:59.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
