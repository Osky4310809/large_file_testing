REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst - RTSXCP3 Email \nThe president is expected to sign an executive order on cyber security at 3:15 p.m. The order will advise agency and department heads that they will be held accountable for cyber security, CBS News’ Mark Knoller reports. \nAgency and department heads will be directed by the executive order to use the best practices from the private sector to enhance cyber security. They will also be required to prepare for the modernization of cyber security in their agencies. The Office of Management and Budget will oversee government-wide efforts to enhance cyber security. No vulnerability study has yet been made, according to a White House official said. \nJust before he signs the order, he’ll hold a “listening session” with cyber security experts.
