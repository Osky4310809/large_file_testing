The deadline for this petition is the 20th of February 2017 \nThe Italian Environmental Minister Mr Galletti is trying to pass a plan to destroy an uncertain but conspicuous number of exemplars of the Italian Endangered Wolf, despite the outcry of numerous associations, scientific institutions, foundations and even the Italian population and media. \nWe fear the irregularity of such plan and in particular the decision to manage an endangered species despite the lack of scientific data. We expose that the Environmental Ministry has also failed to protect this heritage species, denying scientific authorities the chance to share information and cutting funds to the research. We are concerned about the lack of legislation and strategies to manage the conflict farm livestock/predator. This costs the life to about 800 wolves per year, which are illegally poisoned to prevent stock loss.We urge EU to intervene and discourage Mr Galletty in his resolution, in order to prevent the approval of this culling plan, on the 23th of February 2017. We demand EU, in case this bill will pass, to sanction Italy for the irregular and inefficient way to manage an endangered and heritage species. \nPLEASE SIGN!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:09:07.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
