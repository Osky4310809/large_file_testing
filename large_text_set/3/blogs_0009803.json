Ranging from family friends to political associates, people came to receive wise counsel from the former Governor of the Mid-West region and old Bendel State, late Dr. Samuel Ogbemudia, and left with smiling faces. But March 9, 2017, was not a usual day for them; it was the day the sun set, the day their patriarch, Dr. Ogbemudia, left to return no more. \nThe apparent mood of sadness at his modest residence, a storey building and some bungalows, could be felt. The busy street was loudly quiet. Few shop owners opened for business and many residents wore faces all reflecting the tale of grief. \nThe former military administrator reportedly died at about 11pm on Thursday in a private hospital in Lagos, after a long battle with diabetes. But the news of his death broke in the early hours of Friday. At his residence, sympathisers trooped in to condole with the bereaved family and signed the condolence register placed at the entrance of the apartment where he used to receive his visitors. \nPrior to his demise, he used walking stick, due to the pain he suffered in one of his legs. His death came as a huge loss to the family, as only his eldest son, Samuel Ogbemudia (Jnr) offered to speak to the media. For him, it had yet to dawn on him that his life teacher and confidant was no more. \n“It is shocking; the thing (his death) has not dawn on me,” he told Saturday PUNCH. \nOgbemudia (Jnr.) added, “That is the truth. In issues like this, it is when you are in your quiet time that you will realise what has happened. He was positively strict with his children. There was no room to mess up.” \nAccording to him, his late father was regarded as a man who believed in living a modest life. This, perhaps, explained why he prepared his own tomb and issued strict instructions to be buried close to his mother and not to be kept in a mortuary in the event of his death. \nThe grave site located inside his Benin residence was being prepared when Saturday PUNCH visited on Friday. \n”He didn’t want to be put in a mortuary and he gave us a time frame. The man was always a perfectionist; anything he did was to the letter,” his eldest son added. \nAs a former military personnel, he was regarded as a brave soldier, having played a role in halting the advancement of the Biafran soldiers in Auchi, Etsako West Local Government Area. \nNigeria’s former Minister of Defence, Gen. Godwin Abbe (retd.), said, “He was a very senior colleague in the profession. God gave him good opportunities and I think he used them well. He formed the team that halted Biafran advance towards Auchi.” \nHe added, “He was a brave soldier in his time and a tough one too. He has given his best. I know that our country will miss a rare patriot like him.” \nIndeed, the late Ogbemudia was also very popular among the people of the state. Many described him as one of the greatest governors to rule the state. \nA resident of Iheya Street, where the former governor lived, Festus Omini, said the area would never remain the same. \nOmini, who had been living on the Street since 2004, said, “Ogbemudia was not a bad man. When we came here, he received us; he gave us water and light. When I heard the news this (Friday) morning, I was very sad. Well, let us bear it like that. That was how God wanted it.” \nThe late Ogbemudia was credited with the establishment of the Institute of Technology (now University of Benin). He was also a lover of sports, a passion that led him to construct the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin and the sports village in Afuze, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State. \nSome of the roads built under his administration over 40 years ago are still in use today. To many, the elder statesman spearheaded the greatest industrial revolution recorded in the now Edo and Delta states with the establishment of Bendel Brewery, Benin; Delta Boatyard, Warri; Bendel Pharmaceuticals, Benin; Bendel Hotels in Auchi, Ubiaja, Warri, Asaba, Benin and Igarra. He also established farms in Agbede and Ubiaja. \nThe popular Oba Akenzua Cultural Centre, the now Edo State Secretariat Complex, with the adjoining Palm House Complex and the Mid-West Library, in Benin, are all recorded as part of his achievements. Little wonder the state government declared a seven-day mourning to honour its “fallen hero”. \nGovernor Godwin Obaseki, in a statement, said, “As two-time governor of Bendel, which comprised present-day Edo and Delta states, Dr. Samuel Ogbemudia will be fondly remembered for the strong foundation that he laid to consolidate the infrastructural, social and economic development of both states. \n“As we mourn our great leader and father, we take solace in the legacies he bequeathed Edo State and indeed Nigeria.” \nAlso saddened by the development, a former governor of the state, Chief Gabriel Igbinedion, recalled with fond memories the giant strides of his late predecessor, describing him as “an astute administrator and later, a politician of remarkable pedigree, whose advice and selfless service to Edo and indeed humanity would be greatly missed.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:33:28.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
