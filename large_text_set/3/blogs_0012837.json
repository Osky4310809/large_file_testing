But because it was issued by President Trump, it is unconstitutional. Indeed any executive order issued by President Trump dealing with travel from Muslim countries would be constitutionally suspect because of what candidate Trump said. In my view, that is a bridge too far. It turns constitutional analysis into psychoanalysis, requiring that the motives of the president be probed. \nYou can watch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T21:56:13.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
