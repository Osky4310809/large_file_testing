These aren’t minor, incidental problems but profound ones that shape lives.” \nThis affects more than just parents. Another couple she knows are both surgeons. Their son goes to nursery and if he is ever ill — “even just a loose stool” — they have to leave the hospital and pick him up. He then isn’t allowed back in for 48 hours. “That means they have to cancel surgeries.” \nA childcare crisis is brewing in the capital. As Tulip Siddiq MP, shadow minister for the early years, notes: “London suffers from a double whammy when it comes to childcare: high costs and a lack of childcare places for parents to access.” The number of childminders is falling, while nurseries are being squeezed by rising rents and staff costs. \nCarrell believes Koru Kids, based in Euston, can be part of the solution. Even before the formal launch, Carrell already has more than 1,000 families on the network from word of mouth: both parents who already have their nannies but are looking to reduce the cost, and parents hoping this could help them afford higher-quality childcare. 'Help parents pay upfront fees for childcare', Khan tells employers \nThe site launches publicly today, after fundraising closed last week. The co-founder of Gumtree, Michael Pennington — whom Carrell had not met before — was among the investors who gave her £600,000 in seed funding. Pennington says: “Through Gumtree I’m very aware how parents struggle to find quality childcare and nannies. Koru Kids [allows] parents to socialise their children with other children from like-minded families, and at the same time reduces the cost of having a nanny.” \nAccording to the firm’s research, nanny-sharing could create 30,000 extra childcare places in London. \nA survey of more than 600 Mary Poppinses and Mrs Doubtfires showed that 17 per cent are currently in a nanny share, with a further 40 per cent saying they would like to be part of one if a job became available. Rachel Carrell is already inundated with nannies and parents who want to use her new childcare sharing website \nCarrell, 36, was formerly the chief executive of DrThom, the largest online doctors’ service, and then ran a chain of IVF clinics. While at DrThom, she had her daughter Naomi, now two, who shared a child-minder with another baby. This gave Carrell her eureka moment for Koru. “Talking to other parents, one of the things that kept coming up was that they wanted to do a nanny share but couldn’t find the right family to pair up with.” \nCarrell started an early test-run in 2016, to see if parents would sign up. “I hoped I could get one family interested but I got 37 straight away.” She quit her job that day.

Koru searches the database and then presents users with the best one or two matches. “We made a conscious decision that this would be a matching service rather than a listing,” Carrell explains. “Parents kept saying they didn’t want yet another website they had to trawl through — that was the word that kept coming up, ‘trawl’. This is much more time-efficient for them.” \nParents can then meet the best matches and the nanny. Koru also helps with that process too. “When you take on a nanny, you legally have to be the employer. We take care of payroll and all that. It’s an entire service. Because if you put yourself in the mind of someone going back to work after maternity leave, you’re thinking ‘Do my clothes still fit?’, ‘Will I still be able to do my job?’ Do you really want to be researching payroll companies too?” \nKoru charges management and commission fees but Carrell says it is still “roughly a third cheaper” than hiring a nanny. They earn more too: “Doing a nanny share is the best way nannies can improve their hourly rate, so it gives career progression.” That’s the spoonful of sugar that makes the nanny-share go down. \nFollow Rosamund Urwin on Twitter: @RosamundUrwin More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T12:30:10.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
