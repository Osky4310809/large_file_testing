It’s so big, it’s not uncommon for people to get turned around and confused as they walk through it. Fortunately, there’s a hidden navigation method. Advertisement \nAs Mental Floss points out in one of their videos , you should keep an eye out for the numerical codes found on the base of each lamp post in the park. The first two or three numbers of each code tell you which street you’re closest to. The last number tells you if you’re on the East or West side of the park. Odd means West, and even means East. So, for example, if you’re looking at a lamp post with the numbers “7021\" on it, that would mean you’re close to 70th street on the West side. Now you can explore all 3.5 square miles of landscaped beauty without worry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T02:25:10.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
