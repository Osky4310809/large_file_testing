Rauf Aregbesola, the government and the people of the State of Osun, for their support in hosting the Editors’ Standing Committee Meeting. \nIn its first quarterly Standing Committee Meeting held in Osogbo, Osun, the guild said it deliberated on issues affecting the guild and the nation. \nIn a communiqué signed by its President Funke Egbemode, the guild said Nigerian government should be more responsive in protecting its citizens in foreign countries. \n“The government, should as a matter of national interest apply the country’s foreign policy of reciprocity that affects mutual relations between Nigeria and other countries. \n“The editors are dismayed at the conspiratorial silence of senior South African nationalists, who know the enormous contributions of Nigeria to the emergence of the independent South Africa. \n“The South African Institute of International Affairs records that Nigeria spent 61 billion dollars between 1960 and 1995 in the fight against apartheid,’’ the communiqué said. \nIt said further that the guild was not unmindful of the fact that South Africans were in Nigeria running successful businesses and, therefore, the violent actions of South Africans could push Nigerians into retaliation. \n“Just as Nigerians are passionate about protecting their South African friends, they can also be passionate in protecting their own nationals,’’ the guild observed. \nThe guild, however, enjoined Nigerians resident in South Africa to remain calm, law-abiding and continue to go about their legitimate businesses even in the face of provocation. \nThe NGE, therefore, commended Gov.
