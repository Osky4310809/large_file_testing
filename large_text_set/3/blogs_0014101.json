According to a new poll from Public Policy Polling: \nOnly 24% of voters support it, to 49% who are opposed. Even among Republican voters only 37% are in favor of the proposal to 22% who are against it, and 41% who aren't sure one way or another. Democrats (15/71) and independents (22/49) are more unified in their opposition to the bill than Republicans are in favor of it. \nThat means Trumpcare is posting numbers below the level of Trump’s own rock-solid base. Trump himself currently has a 43 percent approval rating. \nMeanwhile, 47 percent of voters are in favor of Obamacare these days, to 39 percent who are opposed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T17:15:10.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
