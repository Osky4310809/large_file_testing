He’s very active on social media but he doesn’t have the same qualities of Ronaldo. \nIs Ronaldo a fading force? \n“I think, more or less, they will make the same amount of goals at the end of their careers. Neymar is already Ballon d’Or material. Actually, I believe in this moment Neymar is better than Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, he’s the best player in the world now, in 2017. \n“If we take a look at his performances and we compare them with those of Messi and Ronaldo, I think Neymar is just better at the moment.” \nNeymar has netted 14 times in 35 appearances for Barcelona this season, with a brace against Paris Saint-Germain in a thrilling Champions League clash seeing him star on a memorable night at Camp Nou.
