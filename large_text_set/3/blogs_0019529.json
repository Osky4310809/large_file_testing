Before we get into the new hint, you should know that Hunchback includes a blink-and-you-missed-it shot of Belle, wandering through the streets of Paris with her nose buried in a book. Disney animators love to put existing characters into new films , but the latest nod is even more subtle.\nThe new Beauty and the Beast gives Belle a backstory , and as she and the Beast travel back to her childhood home in Paris, we get a glimpse at the skyline. And what do you know? Notre Dame is right there. To be fair, the stories take place in vastly different time periods; Hunchback is originally set in 1482, and Beauty doesn't take place until the 1800s. But still! The connection is there.\nImage Source: Disney", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ucEiy-xcln-L8Hg2B9MZwvDIEFc/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/21/697/n/1922283/239d069a155ccb38_batb.JPG", "http://disney.com/"], "published": "2017-03-22T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:16:03.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
