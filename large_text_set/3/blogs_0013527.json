PUBLISHED: 00:00, Thu, Mar 16, 2017 | UPDATED: 21:16, Thu, Mar 16, 2017 The move was provocatively timed to coincide with a blistering verdict from watchdogs on how the Tories accounted for their spending in the 2015 general election and in three 2014 by-elections. The Electoral Commission's bombshell findings include that the Tories appeared to have understated campaign spending in the Kent battleground seat of South Thanet where Conservative Craig Mackinlay beat Mr Farage . Some think pressure on the Tories over their spending in that and several other contests could force re-runs. GETTY Ukip sparked speculation that Nigel Farage could try to become Westminster MP Related articles Tories 'appear to have understated spending' on South Thanet campaign The question is whether the Tories wrongly attributed spending aimed at getting individual local candidates elected to national party expenses, with particular controversy focused on how it accounted for the costs of a battle bus that toured activists round target seats. In Thanet South, the Commission said some of the Tories' alleged national spending related to the effort to help Mr Mackinlay. It should thus have been included in the accounts returned by Mr Mackinlay, who like all candidates was strictly legally limited in what his individual campaign could spend. GETTY Mr Farage has tried to become an MP seven times The Conservatives argue that they based their national anti-Ukip campaign in Thanet because Mr Farage and his party's national campaign did so. On Sunday, MEP Mr Farage - who has tried seven times to become an MP - said he would \"probably\" stand again for Ukip in Thanet if the contest was rerun. But there is speculation he could be tempted to join forces with close ally Arron Banks who has bitterly attacked Ukip under new leader Paul Nuttall and has vowed to start a new movement.
