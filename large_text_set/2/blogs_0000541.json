Television sets were also stolen, and the field is brown from a lack of water. Artificial turf around the edge of the field has also been ripped up. \nNo events are planned at the stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:32:40.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
