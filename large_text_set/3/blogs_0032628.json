According to Hunt’s congressional sources, committee members have spoken with Flynn’s lawyer and told him that any immunity offer would be “wildly preliminary” and is currently “not on the table.” \nHunt acknowledged that the investigation is in its earliest phases and that an offer might be made in the future, though the committee’s current view is that they are “not receptive” to an immunity deal at the moment. \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-01T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:17:19.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
