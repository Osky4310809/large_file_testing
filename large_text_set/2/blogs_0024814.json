It comes up all the time. But I don’t know how to even begin to explain it. \n“I was 17-years-old and playing for Livingston when it was reported that I’d refused to go to the Nou Camp for a trial. \n'Messi in disguise' - Meet Jordi Mboula \n“I’ve been told that various clubs and agents were involved but I honestly don’t know anything about it.” \nRather than heading for Catalonia, Snodgrass moved to Elland Road in 2008 after a spell on loan at Stirling Albion at the end of the 2006-07 season. \nHe has since taken in spells at Norwich and Hull City, with a switch to West Ham completed during the 2017 January transfer window.
