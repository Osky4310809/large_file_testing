They can also like, comment and share each individual article. Facebook users can also subscribe to publishers' digest, and therefore, will receive a notification when the latest one is released. \n\nImage: facebook\n\"More than a year after launching Instant Articles, we continue to explore new features that improve the experience for people and publishers alike. Publishers have told us they’d like to experiment with presenting packages of stories to their most engaged readers on Facebook,\" Josh Roberts, Facebook's product manager, wrote in a blog post about the update. \nThe ability to swipe through multiple Instant Articles from the same publisher isn't a brand new experience. \nAs shown in the video below, Facebook users can currently swipe through recently-shared Instant Articles from a single publisher. \nThis new product differs in that it's a curated collection from the publisher itself and offers a subscription service. Therefore, the update is creating more of a magazine-like experience as part of the Facebook News Feed and offers something similar to Snapchat Discover, the app's network of more than 20 media partners. \nFacebook is currently testing the product with nine partners: Bild , BuzzFeed , El Pais , Fox News, Hindustan Times , India Times , Refinery29 , USA TODAY and the Washington Post . \nIt remains to be seen whether Facebook will limit the network to a select number of partners (a la Snapchat) or open it up to any publisher like it does now with Instant Articles. \n\"We’re in the very early stages of developing this feature and understanding which use cases it could enable for our publishing partners,\" Roberts wrote. \"As we better understand the value this experience provides people and publishers, we look forward to working with more of our partners to help shape the future direction of this experience.\"\nBONUS: Take a tour of the biggest greenhouse in the world", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T18:12:43.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
