Am I gonna end up teaching or...? So I didn't want to spoil how much I like making music by forcing myself into making it work. My sister was studying architecture, she's four years older than me, so I was just like, 'Fuck it, I'll do that, it looks cool.' \n\"And it turns out I really enjoyed it and I'm really passionate about architecture. \n\"I was writing and recording music the whole way through the degree and then releasing it. The listenership was slowly building up, so when I finished [architecture studies], I didn't really want to get a full-time job. \n\"So I thought, 'Why not take some time off and play a show?' At that point, I had just released the last of my three EPs and I just had enough music to make up a setlist. So that's sort of where it all started.\" \nAsked whether he acquired any useful knowledge while studying music in high school, Plini explained how he was actually the only student to enroll a contemporary music class, saying it felt great to be in a class of one. \n\"That's where I got basic knowledge of modes and a little bit of ear training,\" he added. \nPlini's full-length debut album \" Handmade Cities \" saw its release in August 2016, you can stream it in full below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:09:09.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
