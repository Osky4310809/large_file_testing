Then he’s dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through.” (RELATED: Bill Maher’s Message To Hollywood: ‘We’re The Losers Now’) \n“As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he added. “You’re welcome. And by the way, I wasn’t trying to get him removed from society.” \n“I’m somebody who, many times, people have tried to make go away,” he continued. “They were successful that one time, for six months in 23 years, because that’s how long it was between the two shows [Real Time and Politically Incorrect]. It just rubs me the wrong way when somebody says, ‘I don’t like what this person is saying — he should go away.'” \nLast Thursday, Maher came out in defense of booking the provocateur after journalist Jeremy Scahill backed out of appearing as a guest on the show over Milo’s appearance. \n“Liberals will continue to lose elections as long as they follow the example of people like Mr. Scahill whose views veer into fantasy and away from bedrock liberal principles like equality of women, respect for minorities, separation of religion and state and free speech,” Maher wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:18:14.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
