It is much better than anyone could have imagined. \nFIFA: Ronaldo given unbelievable 99 TOTY rating \n\"He succeeds in one thing that seems to me very difficult: to maintain the motivation and the cohesion, not of 11 players, but of the whole squad. His management is remarkable.\" \nCristiano added another piece of silverware to his individual trophy collection on Monday by landing the The Best FIFA Menâ€™s Player award.
