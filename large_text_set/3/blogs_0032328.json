Heidi Heitkamp , D-N.D., said this week as she indicated that she did not want to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch. \n“As I said last year when Judge [Merrick] Garland was nominated — and reiterated again when Judge Gorsuch was nominated — the U.S. Senate should have an up or down vote on any Supreme Court nominee as part of fulfilling our constitutional duty of providing advice and consent on nominees to the Supreme Court,” Heitkamp said in a statement. \nGarland was nominated by then-President Barack Obama after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year, but the Republican-controlled Senate never acted on the nomination.   Trump Gives Pentagon More Leeway To Wage War In The Middle East \nHeitkamp said that just because the GOP played politics last year does not give the Democrats license to do the same with Gorsuch. . @inforum I already did. Gorsuch should get hearing & vote just as Garland should have. Sen must fully consider noms https://t.co/9LAYU6XFTQ \n— Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (@SenatorHeitkamp) March 23, 2017 \n“It’s my duty to fully consider any Supreme Court nominee, regardless of which party is in the White House — such a role should be above politics,” her statement added.   \nHeitkamp did not signal which way she intended to vote. \nShe said she is “in the process of reviewing the materials [Gorsuch] submitted and testimony from his hearing” and is considering his record.
