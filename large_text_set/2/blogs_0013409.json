Bureau of Immigration/Released MANILA, Philippines â€” The P50 million money paid to Immigration executives was for the release of the 800 Chinese nationals who have working visas but was not a bribe, former police official Wally Sombero said on Thursday. Sombero, a central figure in the Bureau of Immigration bribery scandal, told senators that what happened in City of Dreams Resort and Casino on Nov. 27, 2016 was not extortion or bribery, but a payoff. He said that the P50 million paid to Deputy Commissioners Al Argosino and Michael Robles was goodwill money with the agreement that the 1,316 Chinese nationals will be released. He added that the Chinese nationals arrested and detained at the Fontana Leisure Park and Casino in Angeles, Pampanga last November 2016 are not ivovled in online gaming. \"Yun po ay mga call center agents,\" Sombero as the Senate investigation into the Jack Lam bribery scandal continued. Chinese casino tycoon Jack Lam, through Sombero, allegedly bribed Argosino and Robles last November for the release of the 1,316 Chinese nationals arrested for overstaying and for other violations of immigration laws. Sombero said that he went to the meeting at the City of Dreams Resort and Casino with the two BI executives to talk about how to help the arrested Chinese. \"Yun po ang katungkulan ng AGSPA (Asian Gaming Service Provider Association) upang i-mediate ang industriya at sa gobyerno,\" Sombero, head of the AGSPA, said. He said that while Argosino asked for P100 million, Lam did not want to take out money from his own pocket and was pressured by Chinese business providers. \"Pressured na sila dun sa Cihnese embassy, dalaw ng dalaw po yung consul. Pressured na sila kaya kailangan na nilang mailabas yung more than 800 na Chinese na mayroong working visa out of 1,316 na nahuli,\" Sombero said. \"[S]a akin rin pong palagay at narinig ko naman yung tinatawagan nila sa China, hindi rin po kay Mr. Jack Lam galing yung pera,\" Sombero added, saying that they talked about the amount and agreed to the P100 million. He added that it was a business decision for the Chinese online gaming providers. He added, however, that it took too long for them to make the payment since the workers came form different companies and not all firms were willing to pay. Sombero said that they had to pool together money from those willing to pay to collect at least P20 million.
