For his latest work, he utilizes the moon, Earth’s closest neighbor.\nAdjusted to an enlarged sculpture, measuring in at seven meters in diameter, the resized astronomical body boasts an approximate scale of 1:500,000. For every centimeter of the sculpture, five kilometers of the moon’s actual surface is featured, which is achieved through hyper-detailed images sourced from NASA , and lit from within to capture the moon’s illuminating essence.\nSince the beginning of time, the moon served as various interpretations, more notably as a timekeeper, calendar and navigation – while artists, writers, scientists, musicians, poets and many others used the natural satellite as a source of inspiration and exploration.\nAlready exhibited in various venues — indoors and out — specifically across the U.K. and Europe — Jerram hopes that this touring art installation will prompt viewers to understand the moon’s cultural and societal impact throughout history, as well as to contemplate cultural similarities or differences worldwide.\nThis “Museum of the Moon” exhibition will be showcased in a program of events planned for the coming years ahead.\nNow, take a look at Ian Strange’s latest work . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T01:22:19.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
