Jamie Lynn Spears’ daughter is reportedly “awake and talking” after ATV accident Finally some good news for the Spears family, Jamie Lynn Spears’ daughter is reportedly awake and starting to recover after a drowning accident earlier this week.\nWe are happy to report — and hear — that Spears’ daughter, Maddie, is finally awake after she was airlifted to a hospital on Sunday .\n“With her father, mother and stepfather by her side, Maddie regained consciousness mid-day Tuesday, February 7,” the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Department exclusively told People via a Spears family rep. \n“The 8-year-old daughter of entertainer Jamie Lynn Spears was involved in an ATV accident at a family home Sunday in Kentwood, La. Paramedics resuscitated her and she was airlifted to a local hospital,” the statement read. \n“She is aware of her surroundings and recognizes those family members who have kept a round-the-clock vigil since the accident.” \nSomewhere in a duck blind \nA photo posted by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Nov 26, 2016 at 9:34am PST \nBeing aware of her surroundings is very positive news after the 25-year-old singer’s eight-year-old daughter almost drowned over the weekend.\nMaddie was driving an ATV and had to quickly change direction in order to avoid running over a drainage ditch, police previously reported. In order to avoid the ditch, she drove straight into a pond, which instantly submerged the vehicle into the water with Maddie stuck beneath the seat belt.\nLuckily, the family has now been given positive news from the doctors in Louisiana.\n“Doctors were able to remove the ventilator today and she is awake and talking,” the statement explained. “Maddie continues to receive oxygen and is being monitored closely but it appears that she has not suffered any neurological consequences from the accident.” \nChurch Lunch Family \nA photo posted by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Nov 13, 2016 at 10:29am PST \nOur prayers continue to go out to Jamie Lynn and the rest of the Spears family as we hope for Maddie’s quick recovery.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:23:19.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
