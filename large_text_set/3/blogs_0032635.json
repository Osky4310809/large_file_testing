By Rashma Shetty Bali | Published: March 31, 2017 12:16 pm This actress will be seen playing a royal princess in her next film - guess who? \nThe actress and her pretty little daughter have become the talk of town thanks to their many glamorous appearances. Now while the diva mommy is pretty pleased with her young beautiful beti who has become the new craze, especially on social media it seems like there is competition brewing in the home turf itself. The diva we hear takes special care in her daughter’s appearances and is pretty pleased with her sartorial choices. However she always ensures that she beats her in the style game. \nApparently after approving her kid’s look she surprises them with her own elaborate attires. Those close to the actress feel like she doesn’t want to lose the style game to the newbees, not even her own little girl who has become show stoppers at Bollywood events. While buzz is that the young lassie is prepping for her big Bollywood debut, her Mamma Mia is taking utmost care to stay as hot and happening as her betiyaan . \nThe actress herself steers clear of the press except for glamorous events and parties one would barely find this talented heroine interacting with the media. And we hear that the actress has also issued strict diktat to her daughter as to how to behave. The young hottie is known to post hot selfies, but some time back the lady stopped coz mom did not approve of it. The beauty is all set to enter the industry and even did a shoot with a well known fashion photographer. \nHave you guess ed the celeb s?
