From there, the people would move different body parts, allowing the researchers’ computer to decode any brain activity stemming from that motion. After that, the people could control the cursor to allow them to type between six and eight words a minute. \n“As we learn more about how the motor cortex works, we can create decoders that are better at approximating a person’s intent,” Henderson told New Scientist . He added: “It’s two to four times faster than what was previously achieved [using a brain-machine interface].” \nFor Gardener, whose name has been changed by the researchers, he had the implant surgically placed onto his brain and felt no pain. He says he was challenged when external components of the implant were screwed into his head. “It was the sound, and the feeling of vibration, like someone was using a power drill,” Gardener told the researchers. \nWhen he recovered, he was able to get the hang of the practice, typing an average of eight and a half words a minute. Even though “a short, 20-word email takes 15 minutes,” he said that it’s still an improvement from where he was with the earlier technology. “It’s at least five times as fast as the system I’ve been using,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:02:06.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
