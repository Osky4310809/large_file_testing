However, the measure never got a hearing in the state Senate. \n\"The Senate has basically said we won’t take up a licensure bill,\" said Rep. Chuck McGrady, R-Henderson, who sponsored both the 2015 legislation and this year's version, House Bill 307 . \"What I’ve done with this bill is not make it a licensure bill but require certification.\" \nHouse Bill 307 would require coverage of $40,000 a year for the behavioral treatment as long as it's conducted by a board-certified therapist. \nMcGrady told the House Health Committee on Wednesday morning that some states require licensure for coverage of the therapy, while others use national board certification as the qualification for coverage. \n\"Skin the cat whichever way you want to skin it, but this is the alternative to the bill we passed last year,\" he said. \nTwo other committee members noted that military families who relocate to North Carolina are often unpleasantly surprised to find that adaptive therapy is not covered by insurance in North Carolina. \nThe bill passed the panel unanimously and will be heard next by the House Insurance Committee.
