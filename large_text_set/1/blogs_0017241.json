In that program, healthy participants ages 20-30 and another group older than 60 were monitored annually via surveys, blood draws and reviews of their medical histories. \nFor the new study, by zeroing in on two clusters of genes whose activity was associated with the production of a potent circulating inflammatory protein called IL-1-beta, the researchers compared blood drawn from older versus younger study participants to see which genes tended to be more highly activated in older people. The genes within each cluster appeared to work in coordination with one another. \nThe researchers found that incubating a type of immune cell with two of those nucleic-acid metabolites boosted activity in one of the gene clusters, resulting in increased IL-1-beta production. When injected into mice, the substances triggered massive systemic inflammation, along with high blood pressure. In addition, immune cells infiltrated and clogged the animals' kidneys, increasing renal pressure substantially. \n\"Our findings show that an underlying inflammatory process, which is associated with aging, is not only driving cardiovascular disease but is, in turn, driven by molecular events that we may be able to target and combat,\" Davis was quoted as saying in a news release from Stanford, which is located in Northern California on the U.S. west coast. \nThis inflammatory mechanism was found to be activated only in some, but not all, of the older study participants. Those in whom it was relatively quiescent tended to drink more caffeinated beverages. Laboratory experiments revealed that the mechanism was directly countered by caffeine and associated compounds. \nIntrigued by the correlation between older participants' health, gene-cluster activation and self-reported rates of caffeine consumption, the researchers followed up and verified that blood from the group with low cluster activity was enriched for caffeine and a number of its metabolites, compared with blood from the group with high cluster activity. \nExamples of these metabolites are theophylline, also found in tea, and theobromine, which abounds in chocolate. \nIncubating immune cells with caffeine and its breakdown products along with the inflammation-triggering nucleic acid metabolites substantially prevented the latter from exerting their powerful inflammatory effect on the cells. \n\"That something many people drink - and actually like to drink - might have a direct benefit came as a surprise to us,\" said Davis, who noted that the study did not prove a causal link. \"And we've shown more rigorously, in laboratory tests, a very plausible mechanism for why this might be so.\" Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T09:52:42.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
