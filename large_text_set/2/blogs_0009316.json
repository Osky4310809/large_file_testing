French producing duo Daft Punk joined the Weeknd onstage to perform a mashup of their collaborations “I Feel It Coming” and “Starboy,” both highlights of the latest Weeknd album, Starboy . \nDaft Punk’s performance was about as futuristic as you might expect from the helmeted duo, complete with glowing, glacial scenery, lasers, and some Star Wars– inspired attire. (The cape is making a comeback, y’all.) The performance was the duo’s first live performance since the 2014 Grammys, during which they snagged both Album of the Year and Record of the Year for Random Access Memories and its standout hit, “Get Lucky.” \nMarissa Martinelli is a Slate editorial assistant.
