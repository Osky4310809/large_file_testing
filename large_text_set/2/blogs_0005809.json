It continues to lag behind the Conservative party by a mile. \nHere are the state of the party figures. \nConservatives: 42% (no change from Guardian/IMC two weeks ago) \nLabour: 27% (up 1) \nLib Dems: 10% (no change) \nGreens: 4% (down 1) \nConservative lead: 15 points (down 1) \nThese suggest Labour has made very modest progress in the last fortnight. But ICM also asked some questions about when people expect to see a Labour government, and they show the party falling back a little since September. Here are the figures. \nAsked how soon they expect to see Labour return to government, people replied: \nAt the 2020 election: 15% (was 16% when ICM asked the same question in September) \nAt the 2025 election: 18% (was 20%) \nTotal by 2025: 33% (was 36%) \nAt the 2030 election: 13% (no change) \nAt the 2035 election: 3% (no change) \nAt the 2040 election: 2% (was 4%) \nLater than this, or never: 10% (was 6%) \nDon’t know: 39% (was 37%) \nYesterday President Trump revealed his own response to unpalatable poll findings. He tweeted: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. \nLuckily John McDonnell , the shadow chancellor, has a more sensible approach. Asked about Labour’s poor position in the polls at the weekend, he reverted to the standard political response, optimism, and insisted that over the next 12 months the party could turn the situation around. \nThe poll also contained some questions about Brexit and about the government’s relations with Trump. I will post those later this morning. \nICM Unlimited interviewed an online sample of 1,984 adults aged 18+ on 3-5 February 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n10am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies launches its green budget. \n10.30am: The Campaign Against Arms Trade launches a legal challenge against arms exports to Saudi Arabia. \n10.45am: Digby Jones, the former CBI director general and former trade minister, gives evidence to the Commons international trade committee on post-Brexit trade options. \n11.30am: The Home Office minister Brandon Lewis gives a speech on reform of the fire service to the Reform thinktank. \n12.30pm: Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, is due to give a statement to MPs on his housing white paper. \nAround 1.30pm: MPs resume the committee stage debate on the article 50 bill. Voting is due at around 4.30pm and at around 7.45pm. \nAs usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although in the afternoon I will be focusing on the article 50 debate. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:36:03.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
