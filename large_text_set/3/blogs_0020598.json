Allen attended President Donald Trump ‘s inauguration and when host Jimmy Kimmel asked him about it, he got defensive. \n“I’m not attacking you,” said Kimmel. \nAllen responded, “You gotta be real careful around here, you know. You’ll get beat up if you don’t believe what everybody believes. It’s like ’30s Germany.” \nThe Center posted on Facebook regarding Allen’s comments, demanding an apology. Steven Goldstein , the executive director asked, “Tim, have you lost your mind?” He elaborated, saying “No one in Hollywood today is subjecting you or anyone else to what the Nazis imposed on Jews in the 1930s.” \nGoldstein concluded, saying “It’s time for you to leave your bubble to apologize to the Jewish people and, to be sure, the other peoples also targeted by the Nazis.” \n[featured image via screen grab] \nHave a tip we should know?
