And she thinks she knows the reason why they’ve continued to delay issuing a new ban. \nReading from a DHS intel report that was leaked to the Associated Press last month , Maddow said “the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis assesses that country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity.” \nHowever, she also obtained a new DHS intel report dated March 1st, and this one gave the following analysis: “We assess that most foreign-born US-based violent extremists likely radicalized several years after their entry into the United States.” \n“Oh, right, so much for extreme vetting,” Maddow exclaimed. “The whole justification, the whole explanation from this administration for the Muslim ban was to stop people coming into this country, at least for a while.” \nAfter playing a clip of Trump first mentioning his Muslim ban when he was just a presidential candidate, Maddow then explained why this report completely shoots down the travel ban. \n“This intelligence community document we have obtained tonight shows us two things,” she stated. “it shows us it’s the conclusion of American intelligence in consultation with the border patrol and ICE and the National Counterterrorism Center and the State department. \nThe MSNBC host continued, “It tells us that the national security justification for the whole ban, the setting up of extreme vetting is bullpucky in national security terms!” \nWatch the clip above, via MSNBC. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T06:41:46.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
