Perhaps making up for that it has a Wankel engine. Let’s see if its price is pretty elementary too.\nAdvertisement \n\nApparently the worst thing about riding last Friday’s 1999 Bimota SB8R would be the explaining you would have to do as to why you have a finicky Italian one-off rather than a more traditional Japanese crotch rocket like the TL1000R from which the SB lifted its motor. That particular bike’s price proved to be a secondary annoyance too, and it dropped in a 64% Crack Pipe loss breaking our Nice Price streak at two.\nSpeaking of streaking, why do you suppose nobody does that any more? At one point in time it was an anticipated part of pretty much any major sporting event, awards show, or Baptist church service. Hell, the fad was so popular that Christian Music Hall of Famer Ray Stevens even wrote a semi-humorous song about it— don’t look, Ethel! \n\nI’m guessing that most of you are so young that you’ve probably never heard of either streaking or Ray Stevens, and that means you’re probably going to be stymied by today’s 1962 MG Midget too, as it’s about as old-school a small sports car there ever was.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe MK I Midget and its sister the MK II Austin Healey Sprite offered some concessions to civility over the Sprite’s MK I Frogeye predecessor—things like an actual boot opening, and a proper bonnet that didn’t require a miner’s lamp to delve under.\n\nIt was otherwise a pure expression of the sports car ethos at the time. That meant side curtains, and a soft top that stored in the trunk and was worthy of a merit badge for any boy scout who could erect it. It also originally came with a 948-cc edition of the A-series four cylinder engine, arguably one of Great Britain’s greatest achievements when it came to automotive engineering. This one however, eschews the A for a B, a 13B Wankel out of a Mazda to be exact.\nNow, for editorial honesty I should disclose that I happen to own a 1961 Sprite Mk II with a 948. I also own pretty much every part of a 1973 MG Midget except the shell (which I discarded), including the 1275 A series, rib-case gearbox, and front disc brakes that will all go onto the Sprite at some point in time. This all might sway my opinion towards this rotary-engine’d Mid’g. I’ll do my best to remain unbiased.\n\nThe seller says that this red over black Midget comes with a clean title and is registered for the street. Seeing as it’s pre-1975 it’s not held to any emissions requirements or off-road-only parts requisites here in California where it is presently located. The engine is, as was noted, a Mazda 13B and that rocks a Dellorto side-draught two barrel carb. A custom stainless steel exhaust system helps fill the air with Hmmmm , and a five-speed Mazda manual puts the power down.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T15:26:22.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
