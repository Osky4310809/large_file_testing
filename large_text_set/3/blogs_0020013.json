But one group of pro-lifers are about to send a powerful message to Congress that enough is enough. \nThe campaign #Sockit2PP plans on collecting 323,999 baby socks, according to The Blaze , and will deliver them to Congress. That number represents how many abortions Planned Parenthood performed in 2014. \n“The idea was inspired by a tiny baby sock pinned to the backpack of a pro-life student at one of our college groups, and we knew this could easily become a national rallying cry,” Kristin Hawkins, the president of Students for Life, said. Her group is behind this wonderful idea. \n“It’s a great visual and an even better conversation-starter,” Hawkins added. “Planned Parenthood’s time is up, and we are going to pull out all the stops to make sure that they are defunded of the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars they get every single year.” \nI was also encouraged to hear what Hawkins had to say about millennials and why they’re getting behind the movement: \n“This generation, millennials, are passionate about helping moms in unplanned pregnancies and making sure they have all the resources they need so they never feel like they have to choose between the life they’ve always dreamed of and the life of their child. \n“Millennials grew up with the technology to see life in a womb for what it is: life. They see beyond Planned Parenthood’s deceitful façade of ‘women’s health care’ and they are excited to sock it to PP and defund the abortion giant.” \nI’m on board, too! Sock it to ’em!
