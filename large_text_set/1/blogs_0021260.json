Likewise, if you’ve recently snacked on popular brands of crackers, tortilla chips and pita chips, or consumed beer or wine. 1 \nAs the results of increasing numbers of independent tests come in, it’s becoming increasingly clear that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide, is showing up virtually everywhere — in our food, water and even in baby food and women’s breastmilk. \nIt’s not altogether surprising — glyphosate is the most heavily-used agricultural chemical in history — but it is incredibly concerning. The health risks of glyphosate, though downplayed by the chemical’s makers, are accumulating daily. Roundup Causes Liver Disease at ‘Ultra-Low’ Doses \nWhat happens when you expose rats to an extremely low dose of Roundup for two years? It’s a question researchers from King’s College London recently set out to answer, following previous research that suggested it may lead to liver injury. \nThe current study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, unfortunately appears to confirm this. 2 The study involved glyphosate exposures of 4 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day, which is 75,000 and 437,500 times below EU and U.S. permitted levels, respectively. 3 \nAfter a two-year period, female rats showed signs of liver damage, specifically non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatosis (NASH). Study author Michael Antoniou, Ph.D., told Sustainable Pulse: 4 \n“The findings of our study are very worrying as they demonstrate for the first time a causative link between an environmentally relevant level of Roundup consumption over the long-term and a serious disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. \nOur results also suggest that regulators should reconsider the safety evaluation of glyphosate-based herbicides.” How Glyphosate May Cause Liver Disease \nThe researchers noted that glyphosate may bring about toxic effects via different mechanisms, depending on the level of exposure, including possibly mimicking estrogen and interfering with mitochondrial and enzyme function. \n“Glyphosate is also a patented antibiotic (Patent No.: US 7771736),” the researchers said, “and can inhibit the growth of susceptible bacteria by inhibition of the shikimate pathway and could cause dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal tract.” 5 \nAnthony Samsel, Ph.D., research scientist and environmental consultant, and Stephanie Seneff, Ph.D., a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have also suggested that NASH, which is often linked to excess dietary fructose, is actually due primarily to the disruption in gut metabolism of fructose due to glyphosate blocking the shikimate pathway. \nPeople with NASH may go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver, which in turn is linked to an increased risk of liver cancer (rates of liver cancer have been increasing over the last two decades). 6 Samsel and Seneff wrote in Glyphosate: Pathways to Modern Diseases : \n“Exposure of Wistar rats to the herbicide Glyphosate-Biocarb over a period of 75 days resulted in liver damage, including elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \nThis suggests irreversible hepatocyte damage, as well as large deposition of reticulin fibers containing collagen type III, suggesting liver fibrosis, which is a major risk factor for hepatocarcinogenesis [liver cancer]. ” How Much Glyphosate Are You Consuming? \nJust how much glyphosate is the average individual getting, if they’re eating a primarily processed non-organic food diet every single day of the week? No one knows at this point, but the evidence suggesting liver disease may occur from very low doses should have public officials scrambling to find out. \nInstead, in July 2013, right in the midst of mounting questions about glyphosate’s safety, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) raised the allowable limits of glyphosate in both food and feed crops. \nAllowable levels in oilseed crops such as flax, soybean and canola were doubled, from 20 parts per million (ppm) to 40 ppm — just 10 ppm below the level at which Roundup may cause cell death, according to research published in 2011. 7 \nPermissible glyphosate levels in many other foods were raised to 15 to 25 times previous levels. Root and tuber vegetables, with the exception of sugar, got one of the largest boosts, with allowable residue limits being raised from 0.2 ppm to 6.0 ppm. The level for sweet potatoes was raised to 3 ppm. Genetically Engineered Corn Is Significantly Different \nFrom a regulatory perspective, GE crops are considered “substantially equivalent” to their non-GE counterparts. This means, in essence, that they are essentially the same, with no meaningful differences for your health or the environment. \nThe “fact” that GE corn was found to be “substantially equivalent” by an analysis conducted by Monsanto was a major reason why it was granted market approval for human and animal consumption in the U.S., Brazil, European Union and several other nations. 8 \nYet, the problem, and it’s a major one, is that other research has shown GE crops are not substantially equivalent to their conventionally grown counterparts, and they’re already being unleashed into the environment. \nThe latest study to do so was published online in the journal Scientific Reports in December 2016. 9 \nScientists used in-depth molecular profiling methods to reassess the substantial equivalence status of Monsanto’s GE Roundup Ready corn, which is engineered to survive being doused with Roundup herbicide (samples both sprayed or unsprayed with Roundup were assessed). \nA number of differences were revealed between the GE and non-GE corn. The former had alterations in levels of enzymes that reflected an imbalance in energy metabolism. \nChanges in proteins and metabolites of glutathione metabolism, indicative if increased oxidative stress, were also noted, along with “pronounced” increases in various polyamines, of which the researchers noted “depending on context can be either protective or a cause of toxicity.” They concluded: 10 \n“Although NK603 [Roundup Ready corn] had comparable nutritional and compositional profiles when originally accessed by Visit Site", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T08:37:37.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
