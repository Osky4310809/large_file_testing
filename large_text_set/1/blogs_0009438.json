All of them are stars and would walk into any club’s best 22. \nBut as talented as they are, they can’t win games of footy off their own boots. \nAnd with Deledio now at another club to chase premiership success, it’s imperative other Tigers step up this season, with the club — as much as coach Damien Hardwick wants to deny it — on the verge of a rebuild. \nSo who could replace Deledio in that elite five-man group? Ideally, which players can turn that five-man group into a club of seven or eight — or more? \nOn talent alone, Dion Prestia has the ability to slot straight into the Tigers’ top five players. Barring his injury-interrupted 2016 campaign, the former Sun had already established himself as one of the top contested ball and clearance players in the game, especially during his career-best 2015 season. \nThe Tigers gave up a significant amount — their first selection of the 2016 draft (Pick 7) and a future second-round pick — to secure Prestia, so they’ll hoping the on-baller can have an immediate impact. \nSCROLL DOWN TO SEE OUR RICHMOND BEST 22 FOR THE 2017 SEASON \nDeledio’s departure opens the door for Caddy to play a similar role across both half-forward and on the ball. Playing predominantly in the forward 50 for the Cast last year, Caddy snagged 21 goals from 18 games while averaging 20 disposals — a season that seemingly went unheralded. While he doesn’t have the same explosiveness as Deledio, Caddy can certainly fill the positional chasm vacated. \nThen there are the Tigers already at the club. \nShane Edwards has been on the brink of joining the Tigers’ A-Graders for a while. If he can up his scoreboard impact to around 1.5 goals per game while also racking up his 19 to 20 touches, he could join that elite group. \nNick Vlastuin has shown glimpses of his best, but still hasn’t had that breakout year Tigers fans are hoping for. Sam Lloyd, who took a major step forward in 2016 by booting 35 goals while averaging almost three tackles an outing, will be hoping to continue his improvement. \nAnd then there’s Brandon Ellis, who should be among the Tigers’ elite but took a step backwards in 2016. More on him below. Richmond recruit Dion Prestia had a career-best season in 2017.
