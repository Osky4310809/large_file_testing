But sometimes, the death of a phone can creep up on us, unexpected. And it feels a little something like this... You Feel All the Emotions \n(source) \nEvery single one. Who knew one piece of metal could make you feel so much? When your phone dies, you feel sadness because you can't text, joy because you're finally liberated, and fear because you don't know what the future will bring. It's a roller coaster. You Don't Know What to Do with Your Hands \n(source) \nThere's zero question about how or where you should hold your hands in your every day life. But when your phone dies, your hands suddenly feel like two foreign objects attached to your arms. Where do you put them? Do they go in pockets? On the table? What are you supposed to do with those things? You Keep Checking It \n(source) \nBut there's nothing to check. It's as pointless as pressing the crosswalk button more than once. Nervously swiping on a black screen can't give you that fix you're looking for. You just have to suffer through the withdrawal, without being able to text anyone about your pain. You Try to Find a Plug but Can't \nDon't bother. There isn't one. There never is. You Try to Talk to People \n(source) \nIf you were on your phone, you'd be having conversations with people who aren't there. So trying to have conversations with the people who are there seems like it would be a great idea. Except that everyone else is on their phones. Their alive phones. So you have to sit there like a ghost who nobody can see or hear. It's the worst limbo. You Feel Like You've Died \nMaybe you have? Your phone is dead. That's pretty much the same thing. Why couldn't it have been you instead? You Find a Plug \nSure, it's in a corner that's never been cleaned and smells like farts, but you will sit in it for as long as it takes for you phone to regain it's sweet life. It doesn't matter. You can text again! \nWhat do you feel like when your phone dies?
