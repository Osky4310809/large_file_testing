Related ‘The Flash’ and ‘Supergirl’ to Stage Musical Crossover \n“It is a significant character,” Berlanti said. “We’re not trying to be coy about it…we just really want the audience to enjoy the character development and not be ahead of the storyline.” \nStaying mum on details, exec producer Sarah Schehcter quipped, “It’s a man or a woman, and it’s on one of the four shows.” \nThe news comes shortly after CW president Mark Pedowitz announced this morning that the network’s digital platform, CW Seed, will introduce the first-ever gay superhero to lead a series with “Freedom Fighters: The Ray,” which will premiere in 2017. Though the show is animated, the plan is to bring the character into the live-action universe with the voice actor playing the role. \nYesterday at TCA, Bryan Fuller announced that “Star Trek: Discovery” on CBS All Access will feature a homosexual character . \n“Absolutely we’re having a gay character,” Fuller told reporters on Wednesday during the press tour.
