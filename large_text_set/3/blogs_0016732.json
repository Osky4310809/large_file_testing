Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2014\nSince taking office, however, Trump, an avid golfer who is reportedly a better player than his predecessor, has not shied away from his favorite pastime. His weekend outing in Florida was his 11th visit to one of his courses in the Sunshine State in his first two months, according to Mark Knoller, a CBS News White House correspondent who has logged detailed statistics on presidential outings over several administrations.\nThe White House did not disclose whether Trump played golf over the weekend, but a photo posted on Twitter by Newsmax chief executive Christopher Ruddy, a friend of the president, showed Trump wearing a golfing glove and posing with two others at the club.\n. @realDonaldTrump with @pgflaherty and Max Kramer at Trump International Golf West Palm today! pic.twitter.com/R0gebVs1fX\n— Christopher Ruddy (@ChrisRuddyNMX) March 18, 2017\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday defended Trump's golfing, saying the president has used the outings not just for personal pleasure but to do business, pointing to his outing with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Florida, on Feb. 11. The two played a total of 27 holes in a single day at two of Trump's golf clubs near Mar-a-Lago, the president's winter resort where he has spent most weekends since taking office.\n“You saw him utilize this with Prime Minister Abe to help foster a deeper relationship in Asia and have a growing relationship that's going to help U.S. interests,” Spicer said. “How you use the game of golf is something he's talked about.”\nHas Abe got Trump’s measure?

But the Obama White House regularly disclosed to the press corps when the president was playing golf, on weekends and even on vacation.\nTrump's aides have not done so. Of the 11 trips to his Florida golf clubs, the White House has confirmed he played a round only three times, according to Knoller's tally.\nOf Pres Trump's 11 visits to his golf clubs in Florida, WH confirmed golf only 3 times.

On a couple of occasions he's actually conducted meetings there, had phone calls.”\nSo why won't the White House be more forthcoming about his time on the course? “The president is entitled to a bit of privacy at some point,” Spicer said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thewire_in/status/831726155807985666", "https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/843893011243319299", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/525495434928988160", "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/547979137621979136", "https://twitter.com/PGFlaherty", "https://twitter.com/@davidnakamura", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/11/president-trump-holds-partial-cabinet-meeting-trump-national-virginia", "https://twitter.com/ChrisRuddyNMX/status/843164640054001664"], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:15:07.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
