The Muslim children teased a Christian boy who had a cross,\" Knapp explained. \"They have probably been disrespectful, perhaps even [have] hatred for Christians from their homeland.\" \nKnapp explained that although the boy confronted his teacher about how he was being abused and mistreated by Muslim children, the teacher couldn't do much to intervene. \nKnapp added that he even confronted the teacher about the Christian child's situation but the only solution they could find was having the child switch schools. \nThe 58-year-old priest told of another bullying situation that affected a 13-year-old Christian migrant from Syria. The Syrian child told Knapp that Muslim children were bullying him at their refugee camp and integration school. \n\"There were a lot of children who were all Muslims, and I was the only Christian,\" Knapp recalled the child telling him. \"When I would go to them and say, ' Let's play football,' they said, 'No, you're a Christian!' Then they insulted me because I eat pork.\" \nLike the other Christian boy that Knapp mentioned, the 13-year-old Syrian Christian was also forced to switch schools because of the bullying problem. Although the teen is doing much better at his new school, his mother told Knapp that she still has cause for concern.

Migrant numbers in Europe will build up in coming days and their flows may fragment further into new routes, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday, urging the European Union to grasp a last chance to resolve the refugee crisis next week. \n\"I and my children are always afraid,\" Knapp recalled the Christian mother telling him. \nKnapp told the news outlet that he understands the Christian family's fear. \n\"These are very deep injuries and, of course, there is the fear that this could happen again,\" he said. \"Until one learns that different religions can respect one another, that will be a long learning process in our society.\" \nKnapp then urged teachers and others to adequately teach migrants about the principles of religious freedom guaranteed by the German Constitution. \n\"Because it is important that people learn that they deal with such conflicts in dialogue, and it is also important to talk to one another and to say that religion is a decision of the individual that one must respect,\" Knapp said. \"And you cannot refuse or bully someone because he has made a different decision.\" \nAs Germany has been forced to deal with the arrival of over 1 million immigrants from the Middle East, reports have highlighted the growing problem of Muslim migrants harassing Christians and pressuring them to convert to Islam. \nA study produced by the Christian persecution watchdog organization Open Doors in May , which features interviews with 231 Christian refugees, found that about 86 Christians had been physically and sexually assaulted by Muslim refugees. Meanwhile, 70 Christians refugees have received death threats because of their faith. \nAdditionally, about 75 percent of the respondents said that harassment from Muslim migrants was a \"frequent\" problem. \nIn October, Open Doors Germany released a report that reveals at least 743 Christian refugees have been attacked in German refugee camps in 2016 alone. \n\"The documented cases confirm that the situation of Christian refugees in German refugee shelters is still unbearable,\" the report states. \"As a minority they are discriminated against, beaten up by and receive death threats from Muslim refugees and partly by the Muslim staff (securities, interpreters, volunteers) on grounds of their religion.\" \n\"Taking these new cases into consideration there are now 743 Christian refugees who have reported religiously motivated attacks,\" the report continued. \"With more staff at hand, a significantly higher number of cases could have been included in the survey.\" Follow Samuel Smith on Twitter: @IamSamSmith Follow Samuel Smith on Facebook: SamuelSmithCP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T03:27:34.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
