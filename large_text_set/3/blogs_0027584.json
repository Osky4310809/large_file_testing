Fortunately, it is getting easier—more and more companies are beginning to offer extended sizing, for instance—but the mass market is still, by and large, designed to accommodate only a small percentage of women. Lingerie designer Psyche Terry is looking to change that. Her eponymous label, Inspire Psyche Terry , already offers affordable underthings in a a wide range of sizes (bras are available in 36DD to 40DDD, while lingerie ranges from small to 4X). Now, she’s tackling the issue of diversity in the fashion industry , with her newest label Audrey Olivia.

Currently, Audrey Olivia offers four distinct shades designed to match tanned and darker complexions (from “Frappe,” a lighter, creamy tan, to “Black Coffee,” a deep blackish-brown). Terry says her idea to launch the label came largely from her own experiences as a consumer. \"The idea was to create a line under the Inspire umbrella focusing on the overlooked market gap of bras in varying shades of nude for the DD-DDD woman, at a truly affordable price point,\" she tells Allure . \"As a woman who has personally fluctuated in size from a B cup to a G cup and back to B again, I’ve experienced firsthand the frustration of trying to find supportive, stylish and affordable bras to accommodate all of my sizes.\" Courtesy of Brand", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:30:26.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
