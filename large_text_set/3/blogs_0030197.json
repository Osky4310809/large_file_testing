That’s a little scary if you’re just a regular White House staffer.” \nMatthews was discussing the issues arising out of Trump giving members of his family official positions in the cabinet, and even assigning some access to confidential information to them. Some have criticized the nepotism involved, while others have said there are even ethical issues with the actions. Matthews is the first to have compared them to the murderously evil brothers Usay and Qusay, the sons of dictator Saddam Hussein. \nCNN described the expanding role of the power couple: \nThe pair have long been top advisers to Trump, but both now seem ascendent. Ivanka Trump, who is getting her own West Wing office, is heading to Berlin in April at the invitation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel to attend the W20 Summit. Kushner, it was announced Monday, will lead an “innovation” office tasked with making government more efficient. \nEven as Trump courts chaos and competing factions among his top staff, the couple is often referred to as “moderating forces,” and “Donald Trump whisperers.” The phrases “inner circle” and “power couple” often accompanying reports about the two, who live just two miles from the White House in DC’s Kalorama neighborhood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:55:58.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
