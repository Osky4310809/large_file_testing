Notes Edit According to references in the GECK, Tabitha may have been known as \"Bridget\" at some point during development. If Rhonda is repaired, even though Tabitha leaves, her radio program continues to play until the player enters her room. It is only then replaced by static. Her terminal in the lower level of where she is found states that she hides a key under the stairs located out the back door, which can be used to unlock her door. Tabitha obviously has quite an obsession with keeping Raul. If the player frees Raul and escapes Tabitha's ambush, Tabitha will endlessly pursue the Courier. If the quest Crazy, Crazy, Crazy is still active, Tabitha and her movements will be visible on the map. Even before meeting Tabitha, the player can get hints that all is not as it seems on Black Mountain through Black Mountain Radio . At one point, Raul will slip up, and almost call the \"Rhonda\" personality Tabitha. At another point, Tabitha will say \"I still miss you Rhonda, after all these years,\" which is odd, as she is supposedly talking to Rhonda. An angry Rhonda also sounds exactly like Tabitha while yelling that humans should \"stay the hell away\". When fighting her, she may talk in her Rhonda voice. Tabitha lacks the 30% damage resistance possessed by most other nightkin enemies. She references Caesar's Legion as the \"battle cattle\" and the NCR as \"two-headed bear people\", because of their respective flags. \"Battle Cattle\" may also be referring to Brahmin and that Tabitha is simply delusional about them being a threat, given that one of her rants refers to \"Two-head bear people astride battle cattles\". If Rhonda is repaired, the robot and Tabitha will walk down the mountain, taking the short cut under the broken pylon and down the man-trapped path. They will pass through the first check point, guarded by a hostile super mutant and will disappear into thin air at the point where the road turns towards Neil's shack. Before the game's release, an article in Official Xbox Magazine suggested that Tabitha was a male pretending to be a woman out of insanity. Her \"true eyes\" and \"head of true hair\" cannot be looted upon her death. Notable quotes \" I guess it's time we talked about the dumb-dumbs. \" Play sound \" Do you remember the good old days where the Master ruled over us all? \" Play sound \" This is not acceptable. No self-respecting soldier of Utobitha should ever be seen running like a scared little human. \" Play sound \" That's right! I, Tabitha, will take on the burden of your obedience! \" Play sound \" You heard her, Utobitha! Beware the battle cattle, but don't *fear* the battle cattle. More after this! \" Play sound", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:44:06.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
