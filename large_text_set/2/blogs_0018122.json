And Gridiron Labs wants to take them even further into the future.\nThe LA-based design studio has imagined how protective headgear could evolve into a “prolific wearable device” by 2030.\nMore than just a piece of safety equipment, the football helmet “stands out as one of the most impactful icons in sports—symbolizing aggressive power, bone-crushing action, and gladiator-like legend,” according to Gridiron .\nGridiron Labs\nIt also serves as a scapegoat for concussions and other repetitive play-related head injuries, which have been linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among NFL players. The degenerative disease has led to memory loss, depression, dementia, and suicide among athletes.\n“Although not neglected, concussion safety is and will continue to be a challenge for decades to come,” Gridiron Labs said, addressing functionality problems like “clumsy and visually distracting” snap-on chin straps and “undesirable overall weight.”\nTo solve those (and other) problems, the design studio created a modern, high-tech mock-up of a football helmet—er, wearable device.\nAside from essential changes to the facemask, chinstrap, and venting, the company envisions embedded impact sensors, shatterproof head-up display (HUD) visors, and onboard cameras.\nGridiron Labs\n“HUDs can help players elevate their game through augmented reality, real-time game data, and personal health performance,” Gridiron said. “We imagine tasteful, unobtrusive HUD scenarios that compliment the game and player actions on the field.”\nThat includes physical health/performance (O2 levels, heart rate, etc.) and player matchup analysis, turning pros into Iron Man with a Jarvis-like assistant in the arena.\nPerformance and safety, meanwhile, remains a top priority; Gridiron Labs detailed new features like a lock-and-release retractable facemask, improved helmet fit, auto-fastening inner feed chin strap, and exterior sound control technology.\n“As a device that’s worn by every player on every down, the function of the football helmet has the unique potential to profoundly impact players and fans—and shape the future of the game,” according to Gridiron.\nThe firm even tipped an evolved brand system using a digital display helmet shell to animate team logos, display ads, reflect fan interactions, and express players’ reactions to game events and achievements.", "external_links": ["http://gridironlabs.com/future-football-helmet-design", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy"], "published": "2017-02-21T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:44:10.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
