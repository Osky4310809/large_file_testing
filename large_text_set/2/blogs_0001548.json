Easily one of the most iconic gangster films of all time, Scarface has been ripe for a modern reboot for a long time. Despite those that may prefer the film in its original incarnation, it appears a remake is definitely happening. Star Wars: Rogue One star Diego Luna is already attached to the project. According to a report from Variety, the new Scarface will be set in Los Angeles and feature a Mexican immigrant instead of the Cuban immigrant Al Pacino played in the original (hence the casting of Luna). Director of Training Day , The Equalizer and other badass films Antoine Fuqua was originally going to direct, but had to drop out due to the making of a sequel for The Equalizer . That’s a bummer, but hearing there’s a sequel to The Equalizer is a nice silver lining. The film hasn’t yet begun shooting, so it probably won’t hit theaters until 2018. Then, it’ll be time to introduce a whole new generation to Tony Montana (assuming that's still his name).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:15:02.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
