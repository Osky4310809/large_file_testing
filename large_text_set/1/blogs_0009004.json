Could   \nA retired builder choked to death after attempting a bet to eat four pickled eggs in 60 seconds for £5. \nDavid Mitchell collapsed after refusing to spit the eggs out when he lost the challenge, and they started to turn into 'cement' inside him. \nThe landlord of the pub and locals fought desperately to clear his airways but the 66-year-old suffocated and died. \nThe egg matter had turned to 'cement' inside Mr Mitchell and blocked his airways - causing him to choke, an inquest heard.

It's just the sort of thing he would do.\" \nThe inquest heard that Mr Mitchell was having his usual Saturday lunchtime pint in the White Hart Inn, Okehampton, Devon, when three builders aged in their 20s came in. \nThe men - who have not been identified - got chatting with Mr Mitchell and suggested he take on the pickled egg challenge, the Express and Echo reported . \nIf he ate four in a minute they said he would win £5 and they would buy the eggs. If he failed Mr Mitchell, who was also known as Greengrass, would pay the egg costs and settle the bet. \nIn a statement barman Barry Wiggins said Mr Mitchell seemed to jump at the chance. \nHe put two eggs either side of his mouth with a third in the centre.

Landlord Mike Dennis grabbed the village defibrillator and tried to resuscitate him. But all efforts failed. \n\"We looked into his mouth - it was totally clogged with egg' said Mr Dennis. \"It was like cement.\" \nHe described Mr Mitchell as \"always jolly, always up for a bit of fun\" and \"certainly one of life's characters.\" \nThe court heard that police drove Mr Mitchell's wife Carol to the pub after the incident, which took place in September last year. \nShe told them: \"It was pickled eggs wasn't it? It's just the sort of thing he would do.\" Read More Patient found hanged in hospital ward toilet cubicle 'was accidentally strangled by their drip feed cord' \nDevon assistant coroner, John Tomalin, last night warned anyone tempted to try a similar contest to \"think very carefully before doing so.\" \nRecording a verdict of accidental death, he said Mr Mitchell had pursued \"the folly of taking on this pickled egg challenge.\" \nAfter the hearing his widow Carol, 69, added: \"He liked pickled eggs but I've never heard of him doing something like this. Trouble is, he liked a dare. \n\"I just hope others learn from his mistake and don't attempt such a dangerous challenge.\" \nIn 2014, former Royal Marine, Gary Sims, 55, died after chocking on three pickled eggs, in a pub challenge. \nAnd on June 8, 2015, 14-year-old Anna Sexton died after gorging on pickled eggs in a late night binge.
