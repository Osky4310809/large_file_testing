Providers’ profit margins have reduced which affects their ability to invest in the workforce and their capital assets, and deters new entrants to the market,” the report says.

That’s why we’re giving councils an extra £2billion to help deliver these services, taking the total to £9.25billion over the remainder of this Parliament. \n“It’s also why we’re committed to having a fair and more sustainable way of funding adult social care for the future, especially given people are living longer. We’ll be setting out our proposals in a forthcoming green paper.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:19:39.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
