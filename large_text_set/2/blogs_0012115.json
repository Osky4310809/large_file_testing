Sharon Pruitt Pink Sherbet Photography / Moment / Getty Images Updated December 22, 2015 . For centuries, women and men have reported sexual attacks by unseen entities as they lie in their beds. Are they victims of demonic, psychological or medical disturbances? \nA reader sent me the following e-mail: \nI need an honest answer. Anyone out there have experience in spirit lovers? I am recently widowed, and as of Aug. 1st I am inundated with spirit lovers – not without choice. \nI sent a reply asking for further details, and received this story: \nMy age is 47 and I am female. For about six years, my daughter and I felt walking on the bed and other surfaces that we sleep on. My husband and son thought we were nuts. It would happen while we were completely awake or even just getting into bed. The walking would be light and sometimes the bed would wave. \ncontinue reading below our video Highest Paid Female Actors Ever \nA couple of times, during that approximate six years, I would wake up to find something sexual happening. At that time I would shake it away. My husband had been sick for the last five years (stroke and other complications), and this past December passed away. A few months before he died, I found him sitting on the side of his bed looking ashen. He had told me that something jumped on his bed. It had happened before and he always blamed it on the cat, even though the cat was not in his room. This time he believed and was shaken. \nOn August 1, the entities were back in my bed, and this time I relented at a weak moment. I can’t understand how I could have because the thought of it frightens me. The first few times, my heart was beating like a drum. Once it started, it never ended. I developed an insatiable appetite for sex and didn’t stop thinking about it 24 hours in the day. Neither did \"they.\" I rationalized that it was friendly spirits of the universe, but I knew in the back of my mind differently. \nFor three days, going on four, I had constant sex. They did not enter for long and then the next one would come. I could not get enough. Literally, I could not function normally. \nThe turning point came today. I was at work and something that was cold enveloped me starting at my feet and ending behind me. My hands, which were trying to type at the time, were frozen in place, not paralyzed. The thing seemed to scare the others away, like it had some power beyond theirs. It had sex with me while I was sitting in the chair, but it was different. More mellow and soft. It scared me tremendously because it was outward and not inward, like the others. This is all going to wear me down if I don’t find some serious help. This is all true. \nThis is a disturbing story, to say the least, and describes a classic case of an incubus attack. In paranormal lore, an incubus is a spirit or demon that attacks a woman, usually while she lies in bed, seeking sexual intercourse. A man also can come under such an attack, and in this case the spirit is known as a succubus. \nMolestation from incubi and succubi have been reported at least since the middle ages. In a related phenomenon, known as \" old hag syndrome ,\" the victim feels the presence of some entity lying heavily on top of him or her, making breathing difficult, and it is sometimes even accompanied by feelings of strangulation, but without the sexual component of the incubus. \nWilliam Shakespeare mentions this phenomenon in Act 1, Scene 4 of Romeo and Juliet : \nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them, and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage. \nIn his novel Le Horla , Guy de Maupassant also describes such an experience, which he might have suffered himself: \nI sleep – for a while – two or three hours – then a dream – no – a nightmare seizes me in its grip, I know full well that I am lying down and that I am asleep... I sense it and I know it... and I am also aware that somebody is coming up to me, looking at me, running his fingers over me, climbing on to my bed, kneeling on my chest, taking me by the throat and squeezing... squeezing... with all its might, trying to strangle me. I struggle, but I am tied down by that dreadful feeling of helplessness which paralyzes us in our dreams. I want to cry out – but I can’t. I want to move – I can’t do it. I try, making terrible, strenuous efforts, gasping for breath, to turn on my side, to throw off this creature who is crushing me and choking me – but I can’t! Then, suddenly, I wake up, panic-stricken, covered in sweat. I light a candle. I am alone. \nNext page: Explanations and Remedies Prev", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:26:38.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
