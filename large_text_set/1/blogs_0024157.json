Janssen is not in his best moment but he is young, it is first season and we have had a lot of chats with him. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has backed summer signing Vincent Janssen to come good \n\"It's normal. It's all new for him and he needs to be relaxed, train hard, try to improve and when he has the opportunity to play show his quality. But it is not a major issue. \n\"We will see what happens on Saturday. The most important thing is we believe in him and trust in him. But it is not because in the last few months he has struggled a little bit in his performances that created doubts in us. \n\"I think if he has the possibility to play he is ready to give his best. If not he must wait on the bench for another opportunity but I have no doubt about him.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T14:08:55.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
