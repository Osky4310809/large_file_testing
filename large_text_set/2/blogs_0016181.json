Advertisement \nIn order to make use of this guide, you’ll need a Raspberry Pi, a breadboard, buttons, a few LEDs, and some wires. From there, the guide walks you through using the Node-RED program to control those lights and do plenty of other things with the GPIO. If you’ve been hesitant to mess around with the GPIO, now’s the time to learn, and this guide is an easy one to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:19:00.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
