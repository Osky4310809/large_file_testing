Voices The Lib Dem way of solving our prostitution problem is nothing more than an Orange Book for penis rights \nThe idea that full decriminalising of kerb-crawling and brothel-keeping would make prostitution safe is based on the bizarre misapprehension that the only thing making prostitution unsafe is the law. Actually the thing that makes prostitution unsafe is men   14:01 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online Until 2015, the Liberal Democrats had the fewest female MPs of the three main parties Getty \nThe old sexist joke about women and politics goes that the place of a woman in the movement is prone. For the Liberal Democrats, until 2015, the place of a woman was in an unsafe seat if she made it into parliament at all – of the three main parties, the Lib Dems had the fewest female MPs, and they were concentrated in the party’s most precarious constituencies. \nWhen the Lib Dems collapsed at the polls, it became a party of men. And a party of men is exactly who you’d expect to come up with a policy of totally decriminalising prostitution , likely to be adopted at the Lib Dems’ spring conference. \nOf course, they’re Lib Dem men, so there’s a veneer of do-gooding. Some of it is even actually good. The policy would quash all historic convictions for prostitution, removing a huge burden from women in or exiting prostitution; and it also includes provisions to expand services for those who want to stop selling sex, with plans to offer support in health, housing and education. \nIf that was the whole of the policy, the Lib Dems would be doing something unambiguously positive – even radically feminist. Criminal records that bar women from legal employment, summary fines that can only be paid by taking more punters, and short prison sentences that disrupt women’s lives without offering any kind of positive interventions all help to snare women in prostitution by punishing them for being prostituted.

French lawmakers were poised on April 6 to pass a controversial law that makes it illegal to pay for sex and imposes fines of up to 3,500 euros ($3,970) on prostitutes' clients 7/8 \nProtesters hold up their fists and chant slogans during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris 8/8 \nProtesters hold a banner reading 'Don't liberate me, I'll take care of it myself!' \nDespite Crown Prosecution Service guidelines saying that prostitution should be “addressed as sexual exploitation within the overall CPS violence against women strategy”, the criminal justice response in practice is a vicious double bind. The role of prostitute is basically the role of scapegoat: she exists so men can take out their urges for dominance on someone, and then she must pay the penalty for what is done to her. \nAs the CPS guidelines suggest, prostitution law doesn’t only target those in prostitution. In fact, used properly, its targets should primarily be the pimps and the punters: the men who use women for sexual gratification and financial gain. And it’s where the Lib Dem policy touches on the buyers and the sellers, rather than the bought and sold, that its weaknesses become obvious. Because the Lib Dems also want to wipe all convictions for kerb-crawling and brothel-keeping, allowing the exploiters the same clean start as the exploited. \nThe idea that this would make prostitution safe is based on the bizarre misapprehension that the only thing making prostitution unsafe is the law. Actually the thing that makes prostitution unsafe is men, and without men to pay for sex there would be no prostitution. \nThe Femicide Census has revealed that when women in prostitution are killed, their killer is usually a client . In general, women are most likely to be killed by a current or former partner – who in the case of prostitution may well actually be the woman’s pimp, dressing his coercion up as romance. MPs involved in sex scandals MPs involved in sex scandals 1/9 Mark Oaten \nMark Oaten resigned as a senior member of the Liberal Democrats in 2006 after the News of the World revealed he had paid rent boys to perform sexual activities on him. He openly spoke about the affect it had on his family life and career in his book 'Screwing Up' Rex Features 2/9 Simon Danczuk \nHe admitted to sending inappropriate texts to a 17-year-old Sophena Houlihan and calls are being made for him to resign from his role as Labour's Rochdale MP. He reportedly blamed a drinking problem on his sexually explicit messages Reuters 3/9 Brooks Newmark \nBrooks Newmark resigned form his role as a Conservative member of parliament for Braintree, Essex in 2014 after being caught sending explicit photos, involving paisley pyjamas, to an undercover journalist Rex 4/9 Lord Lambton \nLord Lambton, a Conservative MP, was pictured in bed with two prostitutes and smoking a joint in 1973, the same year he resigned. He initially denied it, but later said he had a multitude of affairs after he was bored with his job Rex Features 5/9 Bob Blackman \nRobert Blackman, a Conservative MP had an 11 year affair with another Conservative councillor, which came out after he said marriage can only work between “one man and one woman” Rex Features 6/9 Nigel Griffiths \nNigel Griffiths, former MP for Edinburgh South, admitted cheating on his wife of 30 years with an un-named woman after a Sunday tabloid produced photographs of the affair on a sofa in his Parliamentary office Rex Features 7/9 John Major \nFormer Prime Minister John Major and former MP Edwina Currie’s four year affair began in 1984 and lasted four years. The affair came out in 2002 when Ms Currie serialised her diaries in The Times BBC News/Getty Images 8/9 John Prescott \nThe then deputy Prime Minster to Tony Blair had a two year affair with his appointments secretary, Tracey Temple 43, came to light in 2006. He said: \"I did have a relationship with her which I regret. It ended some time ago\" Getty 9/9 Paddy Ashdown \nPaddy Ashdown, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, was nicknamed \"Paddy Pantsdown\" in 1992 after he was forced to disclose a five year affair with his secretary, Tricia Howard. He admitted the affair to his wife BBC \nEverywhere that total decriminalisation is tried, women are hurt. When Leeds designated a particular industrial area as a managed zone “for prostitutes to work without fear of police action”, it became the site of Daria Pionko ’ s murder . When Germany attempted to make prostitution into “a job like any other”, it brought the rise of megabrothels, where women can be abused on a battery basis. Amsterdam’s red light district didn’t free up sex workers to become vaginal entrepreneurs, but it did make the city a centre for trafficking. \nAfter all, you have to get those girls in the window from somewhere, and contrary to the Lib Dems’ rhetoric about “consenting adults”, most women’s path to selling sex is one of desperation. Consent under duress is no consent at all. So if the Liberal Democrats refuse to see the male violence in prostitution, it’s because they really do think that the proper place for women is prone.
