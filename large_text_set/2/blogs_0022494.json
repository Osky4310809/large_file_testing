Most Popular By Charles P. Pierce Feb 23, 2017 ATLANTA—So the shebeen food truck has rolled in down here to see if the Democratic National Committee can get a two-car funeral from the church to the boneyard without killing a busload of nuns along the way. (Current Odds: 6-5 against.) But, those escapades aside, what's the most startling story for Thursday? Is it the fact that Senator Tom Cotton, the bobble-throated slapdick from Arkansas and onetime pen pal to the mullahs, got his lunch handed to him by a seven-year old named Toby Wednesday night? Or, is it perhaps the fascinating revelation that the new administration's National Security Council was constructed largely by accident ?   To me, the most startling story, and the most ominous one, was the one from the New York Times that I saw rather buried in The Boston Globe Thursday morning. \n\"I am very concerned about maintaining momentum,\" General Joseph L. Votel, the head of the US Central Command, told reporters accompanying him on a trip to the region. \"It could be that we take on a larger burden ourselves,\" he added. \"That's an option.\" The current US strategy is to press the Islamic State group from multiple directions by moving ahead with the offensive to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa even as Iraqi forces carry on their operation to take western Mosul. The United States has about 500 Special Operations troops in Syria. If the US military presence were to be expanded, additional personnel could come from conventional combat units, though Votel stressed that he would not recommend deploying large combat formations. \"We want to bring the right capabilities forward,\" he said. \"Not all of those are necessarily resident in the Special Operations community. If we need additional artillery or things like that, I want to be able to bring those forward to augment our operations.\" Most Popular Ordinarily, I leave the discussion of military matters to my running mate. But there's been a running story here in the shebeen concerning just what in the unholy hell we're doing in Syria. Are we arming the right people? Are we fighting with the wrong ones? The current Syrian government, which is a chamber of bloody horrors on its best days, is a client state of Russia, which is how Aleppo became a charnel house. Are we lining up with that bunch—I mean, with our administration being something of a Russian client state itself? And, if we're talking about more American troops to help take Raqqa in Syria while, simultaneously, the Iraqis are trying to take Mosul, how are we not sliding into a general regional war? And did anyone vote for that last fall? Getty Worse, there doesn't seem to be any real brake on the matters. If \"The Generals\" told him to, the president* would send the Pacific Fleet into Puget Sound to bombard Seattle. His National Security Council is enlivened by the presence of an apocalyptic crackpot like Steve Bannon. And John McCain, in whom so many saps place so much of their hope, is flying to Syria on Secret Agent Man missions to plot strategy with \"the rebels,\" whoever the hell they are. From ABC News : \n\"Senator McCain traveled to northern Syria last week to visit U.S. forces deployed there and to discuss the counter-ISIL [another acronym for ISIS] campaign and ongoing operations to retake Raqqa,\" a McCain spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, referring to ISIS' Syrian capital. \"Senator McCain's visit was a valuable opportunity to assess dynamic conditions on the ground in Syria and Iraq.\"… The senator has been a consistent proponent of increased military action in Syria, both against Assad's forces as well as ISIS. He was very critical of the Obama administration's decision not to launch airstrikes against Assad's forces after it came to light that the Syrian president had reportedly used chemical weapons against Syrian rebels. But McCain has also emerged as a critic of aspects of Trump's foreign policy. During a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday, McCain said the new administration was in a state of \"disarray.\" Is he running errands on behalf of a president* who so distressed him only last weekend? Is he running foreign policy on his own? Bear in mind, all ye who believe McCain will mount any kind of substantive resistance to the current administration. His primary beef with El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago is that the latter has not yet allowed McCain to have the war he's been spoiling for in the Middle East since 2008, when an ungrateful nation decided that it would rather not have him as its president. That war, apparently, would have us fighting both some of the rebels and against the Syrian government, and alongside the Kurds, which will delight our Turkish allies no end. For eight years, there was a president who was cool enough and competent enough to keep McCain's martial delusions at bay. Now we got a guy who puts together the NSC the same way construction crews pick up undocumented day workers in front of the Piggly Wiggly every Monday.
