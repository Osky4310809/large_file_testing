Per Chris Spargo of the Daily Mail , Alexander Bradley testified under oath that Hernandez shot him in the face seven months after he witnessed Hernandez murder Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. However, on Thursday, defense attorney Jose Baez brought forth a since-deleted text sent from Bradley to his lawyer suggesting he didn't know who shot him. Hernandez is already serving life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. The 27-year-old was indicted for the double homicide of de Abreu and Furtado in 2014. The Patriots drafted Hernandez out of the University of Florida in 2010. He played three seasons with the franchise before being released in 2013 following his arrest for Lloyd's murder.
