Fueled by that report on Saturday, Trump unleashed a series of jaw-dropping tweets that accused his predecessor of spying on him,” AP wrote. \nThe piece doesn’t reveal who the aide was or how high-ranking he or she was. “The president’s clip file is assembled by junior aides, though senior staffers occasionally slip in an article they want him to see,” they noted. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T15:32:09.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
