With a body that draws crowds, two seats, dihedral doors, and enough air intakes for a fighter jet, the McLaren 570S will arouse envy in all who see it. Its carbon-fiber-and-aluminum construction, 562-hp twin-turbo V-8, murderous exhaust note, and preternatural steering ensure that it’s no showpiece, either. Other cars at this heady end of the sports-car segment are more practical or more refined—or both—but none match the visceral excitement of lashing a 570S down a twisty road. What’s New for 2017? \nThe 570S is unchanged for 2017. The racy coupe was all new in 2016,offering a fresh interpretation of McLaren’s ubiquitous twin-turbo 3.8-liter V-8. The 570S and its relaxed sibling, the 570GT, are more approachable, more affordable versions of the 650S and 675LT models built by the Woking sports-car maker. Standard Feature Highlights \n• 7.0-inch infotainment system with navigation• Adaptive dampers• Carbon-ceramic disc brakes Trims and Options We’d Choose \nMcLaren offers two flavors of 570. The less expensive 570S, tested here, is the higher-performance version. For drivers seeking a more compliant ride, the 570GT is the wiser choice for piling on highway miles. We figure that if we’re spending $200,000 on an exotic sports car, we’ve already got a comfortable highway cruiser in our multi-car garage, so we’d opt for the 570S. Its base price of $191,100 includes the aforementioned standard features, plus: \n• Four-speaker McLaren audio system with four USB ports and Bluetooth• Leather sport seats• Leather-upholstered dash \nThe 570S’s options list is long to the point of being tortuous, and it requires a judicious hand to stick close to the starting price. Virtually every interior surface and several exterior panels can be replaced or at the least trimmed with carbon fiber. Premium paint colors and packages can run up the bottom line by tens of thousands of dollars; however, should you have the wallet to sprint up the bottom line, McLaren’s Design Packs are the detailed, cohesive upgrades you’d expect from a racing factory. We’d keep things simple with the nappa leather interior and faux-suede headliner for $1930, a bargain at roughly the cost of a designer handbag. The $1500 kit that lifts the 570S’s nose 1.6 inches at low speeds will pay for itself if it helps to avoid even one speed-bump mishap.
