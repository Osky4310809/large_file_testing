Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool are ready to go toe to toe with some of Europe's top clubs as they look to make a major summer transfer splash. \nThe Reds recognise they will need to bring in five or six high-quality signings for next season if they qualify for the Champions League, and they have identified some of the continent's most wanted — including striker Alexandre Lacazette and midfielder Naby Keita. \nBoss Jurgen Klopp hinted strongly this week that he will take a long hard look at his striking situation in the summer, with the inference it could be time to allow injury-plagued England frontman Daniel Sturridge to move on. \nThe Anfield club turned down loan requests for Sturridge in January, with Paris Saint-Germain West Ham keen to borrow him short-term with a view to a permanent transfer.
