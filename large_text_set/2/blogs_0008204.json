Watch | Angela Merkel vows 'everything possible' for security of German people 01:07 \nM rs Merkel has sought to distance herself from her “open-door” policy in recent months , pledging last year never to repeat it. \nShe has refused to bow to demands for a limit on the number of refugees allowed into Germany, and has instead stressed the need to deport those whose asylum claims are rejected. \nBut her new emphasis on the issue appears to be an attempt to pull back support from Mr Schulz. \nFor much of last year, the main threat to Mrs Merkel was though to be from the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. \nInstead it has come from Mr Schulz, whose Social Democratic Party (SPD) is broadly pro-immigrant and asylum-seeker. \nCrucially, the five state governments attempting to block deportations to Afghanistan are all led by the SPD. \nMrs Merkel’s government has held up an agreement with Afghanistan to accept the return of rejected asylum-seekers as a major achievement.

The AfD was third on 10 per cent. \nIt comes days after a rival poll put the SPD in front.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:54:51.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
