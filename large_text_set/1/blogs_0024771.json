As a shot of the White House appears on the screen, one of the hosts says, “Now everybody’s up,” seemingly in reference to that fact that some of the White House windows are illuminated. The time is listed as 7 a.m. ET. \n“According to a report, Donald Trump only watches the 7 o’clock hour of Fox & Friends ,” the host continues, saying that he asked the president to blink the lights on and off earlier during the show if he was watching. \nAfter he says this, the lights in one of the windows appears to go on and off, and the Fox & Friends hosts laugh and jokingly wish Trump a good morning.\nID: 10412874 3. BUT the clip in the tweet stops before the show’s hosts explain that the blinking lights aren’t actually real. View this image › \nFox and Friends ID: 10412981 4. As you can see in the full clip, posted below, host Steve Doocy explicitly says that it’s not a real clip. “We’re just having a little fun.” Video available at: https://video-cdn.buzzfeed.com/22248/mp4_1920X1080/1485537039 . video-cdn.buzzfeed.com ID: 10412670 5. Welcome to 2017! The flashing lights are fake but the idea is real -- morning TV hosts know Trump very well could be watching\n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) ID: 10413007 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! \nEllie Hall is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.
