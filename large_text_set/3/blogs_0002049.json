Friday, the former Broncos offensive tackle made it official. \nAfter 10 years in the NFL, Harris called it a career. He initially announced it on his new job, an afternoon radio show he co-hosts with Nate Kreckman on 950 AM, then confirmed his retirement with The Denver Post. \n“A lot of guys who play football don’t get to retire. The game often retires them or they wait one or sometimes two years for a call back,” Harris said on the show Friday afternoon. “I’m looking forward to the future.” \nJust a week shy of his 32nd birthday, Harris feels at peace with his decision to get out of the game before the injuries of football define the rest of his life. His family and his newfound career, which he said he’s “joining for good” will be at the forefront going forward. \nHarris played five seasons for the Broncos, in three different stints. He was Denver’s third round pick in 2007 starting 34 games over four seasons as the Broncos right tackle. He then spent time with the Eagles, Texans and Chiefs before returning to the Broncos again to win Super Bowl 50 as Denver’s left tackle. \n“The time has presented itself,” Harris said via text. “I am extremely happy in life right now and I want to continue to pursue the joy I’ve worked so hard for. It was amazing to win a Super Bowl with the team that drafted me and the city I have made home. I’m grateful to each coach, teammate and staff that helped me enjoy a career that went beyond my wildest dreams.” \nHarris was the steady rock in that Super Bowl campaign, originally signed as a backup, he became a key cog starting every game that season playing both left tackle and right tackle as the offense tried to find its way through injuries at all positions. \nA unique skillset got Harris into the NFL, but his bright mind allowed him to remain there far longer than the average player. He was known around the locker room as one of the most thoughtful, well-spoken and respected players in the locker room. \nHarris’ final season came in Pittsburgh, but ended in early October after a shin injury, which got infected and led to him being placed on injured reserve. Harris had one year left on his Steelers’ deal. \nHarris said he was strongly considering retirement at the Super Bowl in Houston last month. \nHarris currently lives in the Denver area with his wife, Jaime, and two kids, William and Betty.
