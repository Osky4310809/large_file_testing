Or that thing I said in the headline. Of course pitchers and baseball naturalists will abhor this vile act, but good thing neither of us are pitchers (you’re a catcher, bro, who you kidding) nor are we Clint Eastwood in Trouble With The Curve . With Amy Adams. And Justin Timberlake. Oh, I’m the only one who saw that dumpster fire of a movie? Please disregard.\nThe dude who sent the bat into the stratosphere is named Dakota Limon, a power hitter for Austin High School in Texas. Before we put a crown on Dakota here, let’s all recognize that we, as a nation, have a lot of work to do before we can even be mentioned in the same breath with Japan.\nvia GIPHY \nvia GIPHY \nvia GIPHY \n[h/t For The Win ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:08:21.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
