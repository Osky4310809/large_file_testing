Do these athletes think they are going to accomplish anything by not going? Do they think the President will get his feelings hurt if they don’t go? get real you dumb jocks, you don’t get it…the honor is yours to meet the President, not his for meeting you. Pompous ass clowns!!! Feb 9, 2017 10:49 AM \nWho cares. Long is a flop anyway. Feb 9, 2017 10:50 AM \nHell Yes! \nThat is what I’m talking about. \nIf we can just have 1 player skip the event per each new massacre that the White House makes up and lies to us about….then add 1 player to go to the event for each of Trump’s bankruptcies…. \nSet the table for 6, Melania! Feb 9, 2017 10:52 AM \n#Respect. Feb 9, 2017 10:52 AM \ni’ll take his spot. i’d be honored to meet my President Feb 9, 2017 10:54 AM \nbrettsdaddy11172010 says: Feb 9, 2017 10:49 AM Who cares?

Do they think the President will get his feelings hurt if they don’t go? Actually, knowing who our president is, yes…I think his feelings would be hurt and he will DEFINITELY tweet about it. mountaingirl39 says: Feb 9, 2017 10:59 AM \nwho cares. Other players have done this during Obama and Bush Administrations. Its’ their right to do so and in the run, no one gives a rats…. Just don’t make it seem like their stand is the only one that matters because it’s against Trump. walldefender says: Feb 9, 2017 10:59 AM \nThe left has been exposed as a bunch of petulant, cry baby hypocrites that have not accepted the result of the election. Grow up tedmurph says: Feb 9, 2017 11:00 AM \nYes, they accomplish something by not going. Protest is the root of the American way, from the Boston Tea Party to the Civil Rights Movement to the end of the Vietnam War and beyond. Because we can, by our 1rst Amendment rights. People that DON’T protest the racist, misogynist, crazy POTUS are the ones that need to take stock. Feb 9, 2017 11:00 AM \nAll the scrubs who rode coattails of Trump supporters Brady, Belechick, and Kraft. Yawn. oliveyang says: Feb 9, 2017 11:05 AM \nGlad to see some players make a stand against the corrupt, corporatist, racist, misogynist, and anti-environment government that gerrymandering elected regardless of race or class. Anyone who cares about the welfare of people and the environment will need to be politically active if the resistance movement has a chance. Love what Brady and Belichick have done for patriots football but hate that they support Trump and all that he represents. ch0rn says: Feb 9, 2017 11:09 AM \nOh well, one less cry baby missing out on the honor of meeting with the President of the United States. barrywhererufrom says: Feb 9, 2017 11:14 AM \nIf reporters wrote letters for players to boycott a white house visit to see Obama then the media’s heads would of exploded. Poor fellas don’t like him. You know BO supported the same travel ban in 11. The hypocrisy is profound. You are the ultimate snowflakes. Stay home it shows the type of babies you really are. QCsteel55 says: Feb 9, 2017 11:15 AM \nI see people from both sides making comments about the guys not going this year and Tom Brady not going a couple years ago. James Harrison refused to go with the team to the WH both when Bush and Obama were in office.. what does that make him? Probably still hated because these days that all we do right? Rip everyone and everything \nI hate that Trump is out POTUS but the moment he was elected i decided to keep my complaints at bay. In 4 years, ill have another chance to argue… inchoose to let my votes speak for me and chill afterwards unbridledsexy says: Feb 9, 2017 11:17 AM \nAnd when Brady skipped his visit to the white house a couple of years ago that wasn’t an issue, right? I remember a lot of you on here cheering the move. Typical PFT user comments. Feb 9, 2017 11:19 AM \nRail against political correctness, and then whine when you’re called a racist. Hypocrite much? Kingmj4891 says: Feb 9, 2017 11:20 AM \nCould you imagine if players did this because they didn’t like the democrat president, head would roll. Hypocrites are what make up the liberal left. factschecker says: Feb 9, 2017 11:21 AM \nI respect his freedom of choice. He is a grown man that has reached the mountain top at his profession so he’s doing just fine without any life advice from me. \nJust showing a different viewpoint. One that the majority of Americans use to have pre-internet. Feb 9, 2017 11:21 AM \nInk=desperate cry for attention. More ink, well you get it.
