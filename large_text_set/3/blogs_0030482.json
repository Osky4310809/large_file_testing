(Later they verbally tangle over whether they should \"sleep together\" on their chilly voyage — she's all about it, while he's a little squeamish about \"assuming\" anything.)\n\"The war? Which part?\" he asks, proceeding to mansplain that the war is taking place on fronts all over Europe.\n\"Where the fighting is most intense,\" she says. \"If you take me there, I'm sure I will find Ares.\"\n\"The god of war?\" he says, revealing that yes, he paid attention in middle school.\n\n\"The god of war is our responsibility,\" she says, and here's where it gets interesting: \"Only an Amazon can defeat him. And once I do, the war will end.\"\nA-ha! So it seems that Wonder Woman may have an agenda for leaving home after all. And of course, he's not buying any of this, despite that he just met an Amazon.\n\"I appreciate your spirit,\" he replies. \"But this war is a great big mess. And there's not a whole lot we can do about that, and once we get to London we can find the man who can.\"\nTo which she retorts: \"I'm the man who can.\"\nO snap! Is Wonder Woman going to end the war? \nFor what it's worth, Ares is a major player in the Wonder Woman DC comics canon — but he's not yet listed on the film's IMDB page. Was this a big reveal or one of those passing-reference easter eggs?\nWe'll have to find out on June 2.\nWATCH: The most anticipated movies of 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:55:48.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
