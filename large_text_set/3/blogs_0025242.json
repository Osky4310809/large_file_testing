Minneapolis City Council Member Jacob Frey is planning to introduce an ordinance allowing alcohol in the Commons park in front of U.S. Bank Stadium — the idea being that people will be able to bring their own wine or beer to drink in the park on designated days. “I envision a regular Wednesday night movie in the park, where you bring a picnic blanket, a pastrami sandwich and a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer with some friends,” Frey said. Frey first proposed allowing liquor at the Commons in August 2016. The proposed ordinance will come up for a public hearing in April along with other general rules for the park. Concession restaurants in Minneapolis parks are allowed to sell beer and wine, and alcohol can be served at permitted events. The Commons is overseen by the City Council, rather than the Park Board, so rules for alcohol consumption there will not impact the rules at other parks. Frey will formally introduce the proposed ordinance at the council’s next regular meeting on April 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:51:35.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
