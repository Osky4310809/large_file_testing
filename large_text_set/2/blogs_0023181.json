The location was just one block away from The Historic El Rey Theater where LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner's protest installation opened this week .\nShia tweeted, \"We have taken the stream down after shots were reported in the area. The safety of everybody participating in our project is paramount.\"\nBetter safe than sorry, but police say they didn't find anyone with a gun at the location, and gave the all clear. As it turns out, no one was in front of the camera at that time anyway.\nAs of 6:50 AM PT ... the camera is still down. It's unclear when they'll flip the switch again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:19:53.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
