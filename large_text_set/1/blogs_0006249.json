If it's a little higher, they'll only have to hand over some spare change.\nWhatever the day's temperature forecast, that's the price for a bowl of soup. On Friday, it was a 14-degree high, so soup was a dime and a few pennies (plus tax). The soups will be offered at the day's high temperature through January and February, which sees an average high of 33 degrees.\nThe result? Cheap, delicious soup.\nTo make sure the deal was legit, Mashable talked to the restaurant's assistant manager Beth Zoeller, who said the soup promotion has been a delicious way to get through some brutally cold winters over the last few years, even if the restaurant takes a small financial hit.\nSEE ALSO: Atmospheric river events will dump 15 feet of snow on California\nZoeller said in the past when the weather has dropped to negative temperatures, they've given back a few pennies to customers. \"We're true to our word,\" she said, adding that some people refused to be paid for the soup, while others took the change.\nThe restaurant's cream of mushroom, minestrone, cream of broccoli, split-pea and other flavors are all offered at the weather-based price, Zoeller said.\nSoup prices are based on the Chicago Tribune weather forecast, so everyone's on the same page on how prices are set.\nAlthough getting paid for some warm soup sounds awesome, Zoeller said she's not so sure it's worth the painfully cold weather.
