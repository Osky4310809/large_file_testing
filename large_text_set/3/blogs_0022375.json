The carrier is currently selling the LG V20 for just $480, or for $20 a month for 24 months. That’s a huge price cut compared to the phone’s earlier cost of $769.99.\nSee also: Best T-Mobile Android phones 1 week ago That’s a very good price for one of the first smartphones that shipped with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. The LG V20 also has a 5.7-inch Quad HD main display and a smaller secondary screen on top made for notifications. Inside, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, along with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of on-board storage, and a microSD card slot to add up to 256GB of additional storage.\nThe LG V20 also comes with two rear cameras, one with 16MP and the other with 8MP, along with a front-facing 5MP camera. Finally, the smartphone comes with a 3,200mAh battery and a fingerprint sensor in the back. One small caveat for this deal is that T-Mobile is requiring customers also purchase its $25 SIM Start Kit with the LG V20.\nAll in all, that’s a great price for a phone that was just released less than six months ago.
