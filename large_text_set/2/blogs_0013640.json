But academics just revealed what the real Mr. Darcy would have looked like , and um, we’re a little confused.\nIs it wrong that we’ve just assumed Mr. Darcy would look sort of exactly like Colin Firth? After all, he’s portrayed our brooding book boyfriend an unprecedented four times. FOUR.\nJust in case your memory needs refreshing:\nBBC’s Pride & Prejudice (as if we could forget this, OMG). \nBridget Jones’s Diary. \nBridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. \nBridget Jones’s Baby. \nSo yeah. In our minds, Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy.\n\nNot so, according to a group of historians and academics assembled by the Drama Channel . To celebrate the airing of Jane Austen Season, the channel commissioned a team of experts that included John Sutherland, Lord Northcliffe Professor Emeritus of Modern English Literature at University College London and Amanda Vickery, Professor of Early Modern History at Queen Mary University of London. These highly qualified individuals even came up with a rendering of what Mr. Darcy likely would have looked like.\nAhem, you might want to sit down. Because here it is:\nThe Drama Channel I know, right?\nI mean, we’re sure this man is perfectly lovely and charming. But cravat aside, he in no way resembles Colin Firth.\nAccording to Vickery though, this rendering (which frankly looks more like George Washington than Mr. Darcy to our modern minds), would have been a total hottie during Austen’s day. She says ,\n“As Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in the 1790s, our Mr Darcy portrayal reflects the male physique and common features at the time. Men sported powdered hair, had narrow jaws and muscular, defined legs were considered very attractive. A stark contrast to the chiselled, dark, brooding Colin Firth portrayal we associate the character with today.” As we all know, Jane Austen was a genius, and by giving us only vague descriptions of Darcy’s appearance, she ensured his enduring popularity. Sutherland says , “There are only scraps of physical description of Fitzwilliam Darcy to be found in Pride and Prejudice; he is our most mysterious and desirable leading man of all time. What’s fantastic about Jane Austen’s writing is that Mr Darcy is both of the era and timeless.” \nTimeless, indeed.\nWe’re not the only ones who are surprised by the Drama Channel’s depiction. It seems to have caught a lot of people off guard.\nHave you seen our depiction of Mr Darcy today? pic.twitter.com/Ct1xFBCIgB \n— Drama Channel (@dramachannel) February 9, 2017 Ahem. If it’s okay, we’re just going to continue thinking of Colin Firth as the real Darcy. BRB watching the BBC version of Pride & Prejudice on constant repeat.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:28:31.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
