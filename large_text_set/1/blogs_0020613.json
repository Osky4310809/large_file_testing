A statement released by APA confirmed that the book, written by its CEO, Toshio Montoya, and available in Japanese and English, claims that \"Japan constitutionally guarantees freedom of speech, and no one-sided pressure can force any assertion that is made to be repealed\". \nChina is the top source of Japan's inbound tourism industry. In 2016, 6.37 million visits to Japan were made by Chinese mainland travelers. \nAfter the event, major Chinese travel agencies refused to provide booking service for the Japanese hotel chain. \nTo protest the book's use, Koro Hotels, an international hotel chain in Zhejiang province, has begun distributing the book The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe in its guest rooms. \nThe book compiles the personal journals of a German businessman who lived in Nanjing from 1937 to 1938 as Japanese troops overran the city. It describes an unassuming hero who saved the lives of 200,000 Chinese. \nXu Xiaolei, a China Youth Travel Service spokesman, said that if the APA incident is merely company behavior, it should not affect the bigger picture of tourism exchange between China and Japan. \n\"Tourism as an industry is very easily affected by exterior factors including terrorist attacks, exchange currency rates and the political environment,\" Xu said. \nShi Xiaofeng in Hangzhou contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:10:22.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
