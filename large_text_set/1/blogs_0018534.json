One of his more notable commutations came earlier this week, as he shortened the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who had several more years to serve for leaking sensitive Army intelligence in 2010. Yet, one person Obama did not pardon, is Bowe Bergdahl, according to his lawyer. \nEugene Fidell says that his client asked Obama for a pardon, but the 44th president did not comply. \n“We had hoped that [Obama] would grant a pardon. He didn’t,” said Fidell, calling the issue is a “highly discretionary matter” for a president. \nBergdahl was charged with deserting his post in 2009. He was taken captive for five years, until Obama secured his release back to the United States, on the condition of us releasing five Taliban commanders. \nFor what it's worth (and it's worth a lot) Bergdahl's platoon mates didn't think he deserved a pardon, either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T00:37:57.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
