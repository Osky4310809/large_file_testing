Last month, a clip of Danielle confronting Phil's studio audience and saying, \"Catch me outside, how about that?\" or -- spelled in accordance with her accent -- \"Cash me ousside, how bow dah?\" went viral. She's now responsible for the most popular meme of 2017. they made a cash me outside howbow dah song and it's low key lit pic.twitter.com/LZyYHNU3M1 â€” Savage Biden (@SavageBiden) January 24, 2017 WHICH ONE OF YALL EDITED THE CASH ME OUTSIDE GIRL INTO A BAD GIRLS CLUB FIGHT ðŸ’€ pic.twitter.com/if5pNZzipL â€” Dory (@Dory) January 23, 2017 \nAnd she has continued to stay in the headlines with more outrageous conduct that has conveniently been caught on camera. Shortly after getting meme-ified, she got \"dragged\" in a vicious girlfight and then posted an insane viral reaction video . Earlier this week, footage surfaced of Danielle getting into a brawl with another passenger onboard an airplane . The incident earned her a lifetime ban from Spirit Airlines. \nTo her credit, she's managed to turn out a likely successful \"Cash Me Ousside\" merch line, and as mentioned, she's now the subject of big-time rap videos. \nBregoli originally appeared on Dr. Phil alongside her mother, who sought the help of the TV psychologist for her daughter's unruly behavior, which allegedly included stealing cars, among other misdeeds. Attitude-wise, it doesn't look like much has changed for her return to the daytime talk show. \nThis time, there will be no audience to cash Danielle outside. \"Where's everybody?\" she asks. \"There's no hoes.\" \nThe highly anticipated episode airs today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T18:07:38.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
