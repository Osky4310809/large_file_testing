He remained in neighboring Senegal, where he took the oath of office on Thursday because of concerns for his safety. This is a victory of the Gambian nation.

That is only what they have discovered so far since Mr Jammeh and his family took an offer of exile after more than 22 years in power and departed late on Saturday . \n\"The Gambia is in financial distress. The coffers are virtually empty. That is a state of fact,\" Mr Fatty said. \"It has been confirmed by technicians in the ministry of finance and the Central Bank of the Gambia.\" As Gambia waits for President Adama Barrow to return after the departure of longtime leader Yahya Jammeh, here's a look what happened ðŸ‘€ pic.twitter.com/mzRMWt3rVV â€” AFP news agency (@AFP) 22 January 2017 \nM r Fatty also confirmed that a Chadian cargo plane had transported luxury goods out of the country on Mr Jammeh's behalf in his final hours in power, including an unknown number of vehicles. \nMr Barrow's adviser said that officials at the Gambia airport have been ordered not to allow any of Mr Jammeh's belongings to leave. Separately, it appeared that some of his goods remained in Guinea, where Mr Jammeh and his closest allies stopped on their flight into exile. Watch | Gambia's defeated leader Yahya Jammeh goes into exile 00:50 \nM r Fatty said officials \"regret the situation,\" but it appeared that the major damage had been done, leaving the new government with little recourse to recoup the funds. \nThe unpredictable Mr Jammeh, known for startling declarations like his claim that bananas and herbal rubs could cure AIDS , went into exile under mounting international pressure, with a wave to supporters as soldiers wept. He is now in Equatorial Guinea, home to Africa's longest-serving ruler and not a state party to the International Criminal Court (ICC). \nMr Jammeh's dramatic about-face on his December election loss to Mr Barrow, at first conceding and then challenging the vote , appeared to be the final straw for the international community, which had been alarmed by his moves in recent years to declare an Islamic republic and leave the Commonwealth and the ICC. \nMr Barrow's adviser disavowed a joint declaration issued after Mr Jammeh's departure by the United Nations, African Union and West African regional bloc ECOWAS that bestowed a number of protections upon Mr Jammeh, his family and his associates - including the assurance that their lawful assets would not be seized. I would like to inform you that the 2nd President of the Republic of The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh has left Gambia. #Gambia pic.twitter.com/fQoWJxYXiE â€” Adama Barrow (@adama_barrow) 21 January 2017 \n\"As far as we're concerned, it doesn't exist,\" Mr Fatty said. \nT he declaration also said Mr Jammeh's exile was \"temporary\" and that he reserved the right to return to Gambia at the time of his choosing. \nAlthough the declaration was written to provide Mr Jammeh with maximum protection, it doesn't give him amnesty, according to international human rights lawyer Reed Brody. \n\"Under international law in fact you can't amnesty certain crimes like torture and massive or systematic political killings,\" he said in an email. \"Depending where Jammeh ends up, though, the real obstacles to holding him accountable will be political.\" \nMr Barrow will now begin forming a Cabinet and working with Gambia's national assembly to reverse the state of emergency Mr Jammeh declared in his final days in power, said Halifa Sallah, spokesman for the coalition backing the new leader.

The former leader also had requested \"a sort of amnesty\" for him and his entourage and had wanted to remain in his home village, Mr de Souza said. \nWith Mr Jammeh gone, a country that had waited in silence during the crisis sprang back to life. Shops and restaurants opened, music played and people danced in the streets. \nBoris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, said on Sunday that he has spoke to the new president to \"congratulate him.\" \n\"We're both looking forward to working together to strengthen UK-Gambia ties ,\" he said on Twitter.

The nation of 1.9 million, which promotes itself to overseas tourists as \"the Smiling Coast of Africa,\" has been a major source of migrants heading toward Europe because of the situation at home. \n\"I think it will be safer now,\" said 20-year-old Kaddy Saidy, who was returning to Banjul with her three young children. \nMr Barrow, who has promised to reverse many of Jammeh's actions, told The Associated Press on Saturday he will launch a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate alleged human rights abuses of Mr Jammeh's regime. Rights groups say those include arbitrary detentions, torture and even killing of opponents. \n\"After 22 years of fear, Gambians now have a unique opportunity to become a model for human rights in West Africa,\" Amnesty International's deputy director for West and Central Africa, Steve Cockburn, said in a statement on Sunday.
