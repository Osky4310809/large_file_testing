Alan Peter Cayetano. LYN RILLON/INQUIRER FILE PHOTO \nPresident Duterte said Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano may be needed in the Senate than in the Department of Foreign Affairs. \nAsked whether he would appoint his defeated running mate Cayetano to the DFA, which is what he had said in previous statements, Mr. Duterte said the two of them had yet to discuss the matter. \nMr. Duterte also said Cayetano was needed at the Senate. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Senator Cayetano is a very brilliant man. He would be needed by the Senate. Do not lose him. We can just have an acting-acting [DFA secretary],” he said in a press briefing. \nHe has appointed Enrique Manalo as acting DFA Secretary after the Commission on Appointments rejected Perfecto Yasay over citizenship questions. \nThe Senate recently underwent a reorganization that broke the supermajority. Five Liberal Party Senators critical of the administration were kicked out of the majority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T17:13:10.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
