Britain and New Zealand have agreed to set up regular trade policy talks \nBut Mr English, who took office last month following the resignation of his party leader John Key, faced warnings from rival politicians the EU’s huge farming lobby would mean a deal “isn’t going to go very far, very fast”. \nInstead, the new prime minister was told by the populist New Zealand First party to make a UK trade deal a “priority” over an EU agreement. \nLast year, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox revealed Britain and New Zealand had agreed to set up regular trade policy talks as the Government carries out Britain’s exit from the EU. \nThe UK cannot formally agree any trade deals until Brexit is complete but Dr Fox’s department has been courting a number of non-EU countries around the world as it scopes out possible post-Brexit agreements. \nMrs May today celebrated six months as Prime Minister.
