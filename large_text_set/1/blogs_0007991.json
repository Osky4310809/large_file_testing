It's not a quick process, although Ars Technica has more information if you wish to peer down the rabbit hole.\nThe NES Mini launched November with 30 NES games pre-baked onto the console . Nintendo was quick to make clear it would not expand the device's software library - and the hardware has no way of connecting to the internet to purchase or download more.\nAll of which means that this method is the only way you'll get more NES games installed on the system. Here it is in action:\nHackers have discovered the NES Mini's operating system has a hard limit of 60 games - double the amount the hardware launched with.\nBut enterprising coders have already cobbled together a system to swap games in and out to get around this, NeoGAF users report.\nNES Mini owners who have tampered with their systems have been able to play numerous NES titles not included with the hardware out of the box, including Mega Man and Battletoads.\nWe've contacted Nintendo for comment.", "external_links": ["http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/hackers-unlock-nes-classic-upload-new-games-via-usb-cable/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2c5JLHl56g", "http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1331553"], "published": "2017-01-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T13:09:07.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
