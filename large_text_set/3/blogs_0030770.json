Transfer news and gossip from Wednesday's papers PLUS: Manchester United reportedly want to sign Eric Dier AND Barcelona are favourites to sign PSG's Marco Verratti Share Chelsea are eyeing Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (Photo: Shaun Botterill)     \nChelsea have made Alexis Sanchez their No 1 summer transfer target, according to reports. \nThe Guardian say Antonio Conte has made it clear to Chelsea's recruitment team that he wants to sign Sanchez as well as a left-sided defender in the summer. \nIt is claimed Sanchez, who has 15 months to run on his current £130,000-a-week contract at the Emirates, is demanding £250,000-a-week at Arsenal or whichever club he next signs for. \nThe Daily Mail say Arsenal are unwilling to let Sanchez join a domestic rival, leaving PSG, Juventus and Inter Milan as potential destinations for the Chilean. \nNeither Real Madrid or Barcelona are interested in signing the 28-year-old. Top stories from Wednesday's Mirror \nTRANSFERS \nArsenal will demand at least £50million for Alexis Sanchez if the forward refuses to sign a new deal. The Gunners will stick to their guns over their valuation, even though the 28-year-old will have just a year left on his contract come the summer. Arsenal will reportedly demand £50million for the Chilean (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane) \nErik Lamela and Moussa Sissoko — the two most expensive signings in Tottenham’s history — have both been targeted for summer moves to Italy. Inter Milan think they can land attacking midfielder Lamela, signed in a £30m deal four years ago, for around £10million. Juventus and rivals AC Milan are understood to be interested in midfielder Sissoko, who has been a massive disappointment in his debut season since his £30m move from relegated Newcastle. \nMiddlesbrough defender Ben Gibson will cost the Premier League big guns £25million in the summer. The 24-year-old, called into the most recent England squad as an injury replacement, is his relegation-threatened club's prize asset and will be sold at a premium if they do drop out of the top flight. Manchester City and Liverpool are leading the chase to sign him. \nChelsea star Eden Hazard WILL move to Real Madrid this summer if he wants to go, according to a former president of the Spanish giants.

The Londoners have lost their last three Premier League games and are without a win in five matches. Manager Bilic’s position will be assessed at the end of the season as part of the Hammers annual review. Former Liverpool and Chelsea boss Benitez is on course for promotion from the Championship at the first time of asking with Newcastle, but his future at St James' Park remains uncertain following his clear frustration over their lack of January signings.

The England striker has a chance of playing a part in the home game against Bournemouth on April 15 — which comes a week before an FA Cup semi-final with Chelsea. Spurs are understood not to be ruling anything out in relation to his return. \nEXCLUSIVE - Former Newcastle No2 Terry McDermott tells in his new book how manager Kevin Keegan was duped into selling James Milner to Aston Villa by the club's top brass in the belief they were buying Bastian Schweinsteiger — only to discover they had offered Bayern Munich just €5million, a sum that literally made the Germans laugh.
