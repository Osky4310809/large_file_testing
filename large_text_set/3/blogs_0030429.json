Wrong disinfectant \nPoor record keeping was highlighted for infection control in the clinical decisions unit. \nThe report said staff in this area did not have easy access to chlorine-releasing disinfectant, which is required for cleaning blood and body fluid spillages. \nIn the immediate assessment unit, one staff member was spotted using detergent wipes to clean a significant blood spillage. \nInspectors also found clinical waste from the neurological intensive therapy unit had not been safely locked away. \nA follow-up inspection on 16 and 17 January found that while cleanliness levels had significantly improved, there were still issues surrounding hand hygiene and protective clothing. \"Unacceptable\" \nNHSGGC nurse director Margaret McGuire said HIS reports were taken extremely seriously. \nShe raised concerns that not not all of the issues picked up on the first visit had been addressed by the time of the second visit a few weeks later. \nShe said: \"This is unacceptable and I want to publicly assure every one of our patients and their families that the issues raised are now being fully addressed and will be rigorously implemented and maintained going forward. \n\"We will also ensure that this approach is taken seriously and consistently applied right across all of our hospitals and care settings and all of our staff are committed to this.\" \nShe said there had already been significant changes made, including training for staff and more time allocated to domestic duties within the departments. \nDr Jennifer Armstrong, NHSGGC medical director, said it had enlisted the help of Health Protection Scotland to ensure the health board \"covered all the bases\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:32:19.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
