Where the S5 Coupe takes 4.7 seconds to sprint from 0-100 km/h, the RS5 requires just 3.9 seconds to do the same. It’ll also hit a top speed of 280 km/h should buyers select the optional dynamic package. \nIf you’re interested to know, the RS5 consumes just 8.7 litres of fuel per 100 km, according to the NEDC cycle. It’ll also emit just 197 grammes of CO2 per km, which represents a 17% efficiency gain over the previous model. \nThis brute force (and efficiency) is matched by a lighter body, which tips the scales at just 1,655 kg, a decline of 60 kg. The car’s chassis also features five-link suspension at the front and rear, the latter replacing the previous car’s trapezoidal-link setup. The standard RS sport suspension also results in a much lower-riding car than before, and can be enhanced with additional options. \nThese include Dynamic Ride Control (DRC), ceramic brakes and dynamic steering with RS-specific tuning, allowing drivers to select from a variety of driving modes via the Audi drive select system. Audi Sport even offers an optional rear sport differential. \nAccording to the brand, the Audi 90 quattro IMSA GTO race car served as an influence for the RS5’s styling. At the front, the main changes include a new front bumper, Singleframe grille with honeycomb mesh, larger intakes, and tinted Matrix LED headlights. Look a little closer, and you’ll spot smaller intakes and outlets around said headlights as well. \nThe car also receives quattro blisters or wider wheel arches, which sees a growth in track of 15 mm, complemented by standard 19-inch wheels (20-inch are optional). From the rear, the RS5 is instantly recognisable due to its oval-shaped tailpipes, an RS trademark. Other details include a carbon-fibre diffuser and lip spoiler mounted on the trunk lid. \nMoving inside, the predominantly black interior comes with is accompanied by carbon-fibre trim on the doors, dashboard, and centre console. RS-specific kit found here include the sport seats (with optional diamond stitching in Nappa leather), flat-bottom steering, RS badging, and special displays for the Audi virtual cockpit system. \nThe RS5 also comes with the RS design package that introduces red accents for a bit of contrast, where you’ll find red stitching on the steering wheel, gear lever, door cards, along with red seatbelts. Speaking of colours, Audi Sport offers Sonoma green metallic as an exclusive paint finish for the RS5 Coupe.
