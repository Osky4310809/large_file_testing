Just a couple days ago, he landed himself in the hottest of water by thanking his wife — and his girlfriend — following his Man of the Match-winning performance over the weekend. \nNow, he’s back with an explanation. And it’s not any better. \nSpeaking to the BBC, Anas expounded on his earlier mistake. “My family knows that I call my daughter my girlfriend. That’s what I was talking about. I don’t have a girlfriend,” said the Ghanaian striker. \nExcuse me? \nHe calls his daughter his girlfriend?? \nAnas, who has been married for seven years and has two children, says his wife isn’t worried about any infidelity, but he failed to address the large pink elephant in the room. \nHe calls his daughter his girlfriend! \n“I love her [his wife] so much. She’s given me two beautiful children. She is fine. She knows what kind of man I am so I am not worried,” said Anas. \nAnas’s wife might not be worried, and he might not be worried, but maybe just for future reference, he should find a new nickname for his daughter. \nJust maybe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:05:54.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
