Ismaeel collapsed at Al-Hijrah School in Small Heath, Birmingham (Photo: Birmingham Post and Mail) Read More Girl, 5, died after mum turned up FOUR minutes late for emergency appointment and GP refused to see her \nBut the grief-stricken relative, who only gave his name as Mo, said: \"At the moment the death is a mystery and we won't know the reason until there has been a proper investigation. \n\"My nephew had a dairy allergy but was not allergic to fish as far as is known, so it is wrong to suggest that is what happened. \n\"He was a bright, very happy child and he was loved by his school.\" \nBirmingham City Council is now investigating the death at the school, which caters for 780 pupils aged five to 16. It is not a faith school but all of the pupils are Muslim and the curriculum follows an Islamic ethos. \nOfsted decided the institution \"requires improvement\" after its last inspection. Ismaeel was rushed to Heartlands Hospital where he later died (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nA spokesman for West Midlands Police said: \"Police are investigating after a nine year old child died after being taken ill at school. \"Emergency services were called to the Al Hijrah School in Burbidge Road, Bordesley Green, at 2.20pm Friday 3 March, following reports a pupil had collapsed after suffering a suspected allergic reaction. \"The boy was rushed to Heartlands Hospital, where he tragically later died. \"Police are working with the school and Birmingham City Council to establish the circumstances around his death.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T11:10:33.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
