Cristiano gets angry when he's replaced, just like Isco or anyone else does. \n\"It's important because that character is good.\" \nNacho also praised the impact of Madrid's 'BBC' front three of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale after they all delivered strong performances in last weekend's win. \n\"The BBC are very important,\" he said. \"They've given us trophies. They may have had some good times and some that were a little worse, but for us the BBC are vital.\" \nKeylor Navas was another to impress against Ernesto Valverde's side, with a second-half stop to deny Inaki Williams the pick of a number of good saves. \nThere had been calls for the Costa Rica international to be dropped after some erratic performances but Nacho believes he has shown great mental fortitude to come through a tough spell. \nTop PL international goalscorers \n\"I heard him say that Madrid players are in the spotlight and it's true,\" said the Spain defender. \"When you have a game that isn't so good, you're a target for criticism. \n\"Keylor is very calm, he works every day. We all have bad days. He looks strong to me. You have to be strong psychologically and Keylor is. \n\"He's had two very good games and so he can take a break with the national team.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T21:16:55.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
