Pray for him and his family,” said Brooks. “And for the president going in, pray for him and his family to guide this nation.” \n“We can’t thank the Obamas enough for serving this country,” he added. “And may God hold Trump’s hand in the decisions that he makes in this country’s name as well.”   \nYou can watch his entire video right here. The relevant comments about the inauguration come around the 4:00 minute mark: \nSo there you have it, Garth Brooks turned down an invitation to perform at Trump’s inauguration due to previous commitments he had made to his legions of fans who were shelling out their hard-earned dollars to watch him strum a guitar and sing a few tunes. \nAs for his request that everybody pray for both the Obama and Trump families as they proceed through this major transition, we wholeheartedly second that motion.
