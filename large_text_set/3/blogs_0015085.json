Bates Jr. was arrested and charged with first-degree attempted sodomy and attempted statutory sodomy after he allegedly tried to rape a 2-year-old girl. \nThe mother says she was watching her daughter play on a swing at a Kansas City playground when Bates allegedly ran up behind the 2-year-old, took her off the swing and tried to pull her diaper down. \nThe little girl’s mother told police the man had been “eyeballing” her child before the attempted crime. \nIt was when the man allegedly began to pull his pants down and thrust himself against her daughter that she quickly jumped up to get Bates off of her child with a flurry of punches. \nLaw enforcement officials say the woman knocked Bates to the ground and unloaded on him with nonstop punches. Bates reportedly fled the scene following the altercation. \nThe terrified and infuriated Missouri mother then left the playground and ran into a nearby homeless shelter with her 2-year-old daughter, according to reports. \nPolice eventually located Bates and took him into custody. During his arrest, authorities found marijuana on him. They also found “an unidentified white vial of fluid with a chemical odor.” \nThe man was taken to the Jackson County Detention Center where he was questioned. Bates allegedly told police that he took a cigarette from a stranger near the playground, smoked it and “blacked out.” \nHe apparently became coherent only after he had already allegedly attempted to rape the child. \nAs of now, William L. Bates Jr. is currently being held on a cash bond amount of $150,000 and has been given a court date of March 29. \nAnd now we must ask ourselves: What the fuck is wrong with the human race?
