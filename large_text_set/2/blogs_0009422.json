Naturally, all keen footballing minds are therefore focused on the summer transfer window, which is going to be great! Avoid the rush and book the 31 August off work now! \nOne player who might be on the move is Alexis Sánchez: amazingly, it’s turned out that having his career ruined by team-mates who do not share his talent, focus and desire cannot be mitigated by a pair of twee dog banners . And, in any event, he’s had enough of being challenged, so would like to join either Juventus or Paris Saint-Germain, while Arsenal must decide whether to sell him this year or allow him to allow his contract to run down. The player will decide on his course of action only after consulting with his unusually astute and selfless advisors, Atom Sánchez and Humber Sánchez. Arsenal need stuttering Mesut Özil to find early-season form for Bayern test Read more \nIn other Arsenal news, there has been a rush of speculation as to the club’s next manager after Arsène Wenger announced his retirement via the usual oracle of Ian Wright . It was reported that moves to find his successor were already underway, with an approach made to Borussia Dortmund for Thomas Tuchel, but Hans-Joachim Watzke, the club’s famously self-effacing CEO, has already deemed the rumours to be “completely fictional stuff”. Though Tuchel may eventually leave the Rhineland, sources close to him confide that his Wednesday afternoon World of Warcraft game is delicately poised, and he is similarly attached to his Saturday evening Dungeons and Dragons club. \nMeanwhile, Wenger is still planning for the future, registering an interest in Kylian – easiest terrace chant ever – Mbappé. The Monaco forward has scored seven goals in 19 appearances so far this season, with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United, and every other club anyone chooses to link with him already linked with him. \nElsewhere, Ross Barkley is considering leaving Everton. This would be a body-blow to all who have experienced the thrill of him saying “Lukaku” but given his shaky relationship with Ronald Koeman, he is in no rush to extend a contract which expires next summer. Both Manchester clubs are said to be “monitoring developments”, likewise Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal . \nNorth of the border, all at Glasgow Rangers have breathed a sigh of relief. Partly because Mark Warburton has finally departed – he is expected to turn up at Nottingham Forest shortly – and partly because the great Alex McLeish has declared himself interested in the job. “Obviously there’s a lot of speculation,” he speculated a lot; “At the moment there’s nothing I can update you on,” he updated you on nothing; “I’m a Rangers man so you obviously have to keep that in consideration,” he kept in consideration; “When you get asked to join a club like Rangers it’s obviously a hard offer to turn down,” he wasn’t asked to join a club like Rangers and hasn’t been given a hard offer to turn down. Or, put another way, it’s on! ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:32:45.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
