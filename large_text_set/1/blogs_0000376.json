He interviewed with the Broncos for their head coaching position in 2015, so has seen his name come up with that job open again and has also been mentioned as a candidate for the 49ers. \nIn a press conference Monday, Chargers General Manager Tom Telesco said their pool of candidates is “pretty big right now” so Patricia and Joseph may have some company on the interview list soon.
