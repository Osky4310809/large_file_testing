Prince Harry (Photo: Collect Unknown) \n“They all think his new grooming methods are down to his desire to look his shiny best for Meghan. \n\"His chest is now like something you’d see from guys in Baywatch - but without the tan.” \nLast week, the couple attended the wedding of Harry’s best friend and wingman Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip in Montego Bay, Jamaica.

The marriage lasted two years. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T07:09:53.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
