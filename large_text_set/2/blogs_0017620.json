Although day one patches and possible \"booster packs\" (like faster load times and the like) are a possibility, you won't have any space issues if you're going solely physical. It's not like we expected there to be mandatory installs with a cartridge, but confirmation is always nice.\nGoing physical is particularly easy to do on the Switch at launch, as a ton of indie developers are releasing physical editions, even for ports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:57:01.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
