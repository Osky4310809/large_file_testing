Rachel Leah Blumenthal for Eater Casa B’s upstairs space, before renovations. Rachel Leah Blumenthal for Eater Casa B’s upstairs space, before renovations. Rachel Leah Blumenthal for Eater A two-story restaurant in Somerville’s Union Square has made some changes to its ground-level dining space. Casa B has modified its vibe a bit, with a refreshed decor in its upstairs dining room (located at ground level), along with a handful of menu revisions. The Casa B team has abandoned the upper floor’s white furniture and accents for darker tones, also introducing more bar seating and high-tops for a casual feel, according to bar manager Taso Papatsoris and owners Angelina Jockovich and Alberto Cabré. Downstairs, the dining, lounge, and bar areas remain unchanged. Casa B’s menu features a variety of Spanish and Caribbean tapas alongside wine, sherry, rum, plus an assortment of Latin American, Caribbean, and Spanish wines and beers. When it unveils the new decor, the restaurant will have expanded its sipping rum offerings, as well as its local craft beer menu, with one on tap from the neighboring Aeronaut Brewing Co. Papatsoris will continue managing the cocktail program, which will lean towards classic rum as well as Latin American cocktails and variations. The food menu at Casa B will continue to feature many current favorites, as well as new items, all in the format of shareable plates in small, medium, and large sizes. When the kitchen is not open, Casa B will have a small bar menu for guests. The Casa B team hopes to formally open the upstairs bar on April 7. While the restaurant hours remain the same (5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday through Saturday), the new bar will have slightly extended hours: Monday through Thursday from 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. (bar menu available 9:30 p.m. to 11:15 p.m.); Friday and Saturday from 5 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. (bar menu available 10:30 p.m. to 12:15 a.m.); and Sunday from 3 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. (bar menu available 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. to 11:15 p.m.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:18:34.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
