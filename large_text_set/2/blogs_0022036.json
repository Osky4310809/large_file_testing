But with pantry cooking being February’s name of the game and the hope of pasta alla vodka becoming a weeknight staple, the time had come to give it a go. Anchovies or ’nduja? (Kidding: It’s the latter.) Photo by Alexandra Stafford \nAfter sweating a chopped onion and a few cloves of garlic, into the skillet went the ‘nduja, which quickly broke down, the pâté-like purée dissolving like anchovies melting in hot oil . As fiery smells wafted from the pan, in went the vodka, followed by the crushed tomatoes, and, later, the heavy cream. \nThe dish came together as quickly as promised and in the end tasted complex—sweet, sharp and rich like classic pasta alla vodka with the added dimension of heat and smoke. There are lots of big-flavor ingredients—vodka, cream, Parmigiano Reggiano—working together in this dish, but the ‘nduja, which is smoked and aged for one to two years, no doubt pulled the most weight, lending such depth of flavor in such a short period of time. Cream first, cheese last. Photos by Alexandra Stafford A few tips: \nWhat, if anything, can replace the ‘nduja? Colu notes for a meat-free dish, you can simply omit it and use a pinch of red pepper flakes in its place, though you’ll lose the smoky element. \nCrushed tomatoes, as the recipe suggests, as opposed to whole peeled tomatoes, makes this come together more easily, but if you prefer to use whole, peeled tomatoes, go ahead. I like to snip them with scissors in the pan to help them break down. \nThe parsley and oregano will add a spot of color and a touch of freshness, but the pasta is delicious without them, so don’t feel the need to rush to the store if you don’t have them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:49:39.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
