Politico counted three other factual misstatements by Spicer, including on transit figure comparisons. \nSpicer immediately launched into an angry barrage at the media in the same press conference, in which he didn’t take questions. “Some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,” he alleged, before making statements that aerial photos contradict. Not surprisingly, then, the former Republican National Committee press spokesman found himself the butt of jokes and the subject of Twitter memes. \n— Sandrine (@Sandrina1978) January 22, 2017 \nHowever, despite the joking around, many people felt the Spicer comment was a big problem and a bad warning sign. Not POTUS's job to hold media accountable. Is media's job to hold POTUS accountable. Is citizen's job to hold both accountable. #SpicerFacts \n— Jason Pickering (@JasonP8681) January 22, 2017 \nOr just not worth talking about at all. We have more pressing matters than debating the attendance at Donald Trump's inauguration. #SpicerFacts \n— Daniel Bruski 🇺🇸 (@DanielBruski) January 22, 2017 \nWhat Spicer actually said is this: “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.” According to Politico, there’s no real way to calculate global viewing audience but “at least four previous presidents drew bigger domestic TV audiences than Trump.” CBS reported that Nielsen ratings show about 30.6 million people watched the Trump inauguration, compared to 38 million who watched Obama’s. And then there are those shots of the Mall: Comparing the crowds at Donald Trump’s and Barack Obama’s inaugurations https://t.co/U4dIVzCKbH pic.twitter.com/zf8hxVDMpO \n— The New York Times (@nytimes) January 20, 2017 \nSpicer also said “no one had numbers.” \nHe claimed that photographs of the inaugural proceedings were “intentionally framed” to minimize “the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall.” He said it was the first time that floor coverings were used to cover the grass on the Mall, highlighting areas where people were not standing. But it wasn’t the first time floor coverings were used; CNN reported they were used for Obama’s 2013 Inauguration. \nThe hashtags #SpicerFacts and #SpicerSays were created to mock Spicer, whose press conference came the day after Trump was sworn in as the nation’s 45th president. \nHere are some of the best/funniest Sean Spicer memes and Tweets. Many of them came up with statements that were prima facie ridiculous. That wasn't a crowd at the Obama inauguration. It was people-colored grass.
