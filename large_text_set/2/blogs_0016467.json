You will be able to remain here.”\nBut some migrant rights’ groups called the measure largely symbolic as Montreal joined other North American cities such as San Francisco, Boston, New York and Chicago as designated sanctuary cities.\nA number of groups told a news conference a few hours before the motion passed that while the gesture would be in good faith, it wouldn’t provide the tangible changes to make Montreal truly a sanctuary city.\n“He’s coming from a good place, I’m not going to deny that,” said Jaggi Singh, a spokesman for Solidarity Across Borders. “But it doesn’t go far enough.”\nSingh said the city should at least ensure that Montreal police and transit officials will not collaborate with Canada Border Services Agency and hand over undocumented migrants.\nSingh said there are countless instances where an arrest on a minor infraction can lead to deportation, while the representative of a sex-workers’ rights group told the news conference that undocumented women working at massage parlours are routinely handed over to immigration officials.\n“Honestly, in many ways, having a symbolic motion can be worse than having no motion at all,” said Singh.\n“What it does is creates a false sense of security and false sense of protection and the moment where the police are deporting people, you destroy any sense of trust.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:59:05.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
