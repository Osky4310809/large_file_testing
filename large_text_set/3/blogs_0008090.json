This is the Zoe e-Sport Concept, which has been created to help develop the brand’s future electric cars and celebrate its success in Formula E under the Renault e.dams banner. \nAs such, it sports an exterior colour scheme similar to the livery found on Renault’s Formula E race car – matte blue with yellow highlights and plenty of carbon-fibre trim. It also comes with a wide bodykit that comes with a front airdam and splitter, as well as a carbon-fibre spoiler. \nThe new bodywork also sees a wider track, allowing for larger 20-inch centre-locking wheels to the fitted, wrapped with 245/35 tyres. Additionally, the car gets larger brakes, a flat floor and a rear diffuser to go along with the other changes. \nInside, you get a pair of Recaro bucket seats and racing harnesses to go along with a dedicated digital instrument panel, rectangular steering wheel, aluminium switches and trim, as well as a generous splashing of Alcantara. \nSo far so good, and it gets even better when we talk about the car’s electric powertrain, which is powered by the same electric motor from the Formula E race car. However, where the Z.E. 16 only gets one electric motor at the back, the special Zoe comes with two (front and rear) to give it all-wheel drive. \nNaturally, there’s more power at the driver’s disposal compared to the Formula E car’s 268 hp, with the total system output being rated at 462 hp and 640 Nm of torque. For further comparison, the regular Zoe offers just 92 hp and 220 Nm of torque. \nThere are four driving modes available here, include one that helps conserve battery power by adjusting the power output and distribution of torque. Due to the high-performance nature of the electric powertrain, the Zoe e-Sport dedicates nearly a third of its 1,400 kg weight to a larger 450 kg battery, which is 160 kg more than one found in the standard car. \nEven so, the Zoe e-Sport will still sprint from zero to 100 km/h in just 3.2 seconds, which is 10.3 seconds than a regular Zoe. It will also accelerate to a top speed of 209 km/h but how is this possible? \nWell, to compensate for that hefty battery pack, the Zoe’s chassis has been replaced with a tubular steel structure, while the majority of the bodywork is made from carbon-fibre and Kevlar. As a result, the concept weight just 1,400 kg, 68 kg less than the normal Zoe. \nDue to the new chassis structure, the standard MacPherson strut front and torsion beam rear suspension setup have been replaced with double-wishbones all around. They are accompanied by four-way adjustable Ohlins dampers to match.
