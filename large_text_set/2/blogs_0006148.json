This season, the Foxes have played five more games in all competitions than at the same stage 12 months ago, with Ranieri having to consider the demands of Champions League football on his squad. \nHe also lost Amartey, Mahrez and Islam Slimani to Africa Cup of Nations duty, making changes inevitable. \nBut it is not just the players who have changed regularly - Ranieri has also started tinkering with his formation. \nThe 4-4-2 set-up that brought them so much success last season has been replaced in recent weeks, and Leicester have started with a different formation in each of their past four games. \nThat has widely been perceived as a failing of Ranieri's, confusing his players and sending mixed messages - the Italian himself conceding they were struggling to adapt after a 3-0 defeat at Southampton in January. \n\"Maybe my players didn't understand my idea very well,\" he reflected. \nBut perhaps Ranieri was actually too slow to identify his side's problems, and too reluctant to move away from 4-4-2. \nWhile many teams adapt their formation depending on the opposition (Tottenham and Manchester City are just two of the sides to have played three at the back against Chelsea's system this season), Ranieri had avoided doing that. \nIn fact, of the 18 Premier League teams to have used more than one formation in 2016-17 (Arsenal and Liverpool have not altered theirs), Leicester were the last to change.
