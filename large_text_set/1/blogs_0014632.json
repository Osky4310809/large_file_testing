It was, unfortunately, apparently only available to customers in Japan and Lil Yachty. In spite of this, we were able to get our hands on a pair to give you a closer look, which you can see above.\nAnd that’s not the only bit of good news. Over the weekend, the sneaker became available at COMME des GARÇONS and Dover Street Market stores around the world, retailing for $320. No word yet on whether Nike will release the sneaker, but stay tuned.\nFirst seen last week at Paris Fashion Week, the COMME des GARÇONS x Nike Dunk High “Clear” boasts an upper of black and cream, Swoosh branding on the tongue, CDG branding on the heel and PVC side panels.\nIn other Nike news, the brand has recently announced that it will be launching the Special Field Air Force 1 sneaker in four new colorways.
