In February, a judge blocked the deal on antitrust grounds.\nAnthem is appealing that decision and could be forced to pay Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee and further damages. A hearing on the appeal is scheduled for this week.\nAnthem in 2016 recorded $2.5 billion in net income.\nThe company is hoping the Trump administration’s Justice Department will less aggressively pursue blocking the merger.\nThe 65-year-old Swedish last week spoke with President Trump to express his support for Trump’s health care plan. It is not known whether the subject of the merger was brought up.\nCigna is suing Anthem in a separate court case for $13 billion, plus the breakup fee. The next hearing in that Delaware case is in mid-April.\nAnthem in its proxy filing said it gave Swedish a raise to recognize his performance and place his target pay closer to that of his peers.\nAnthem’s shares in the last two years have risen 6 percent while, over the same time frame, UnitedHealth is up 41 percent, Aetna 19 percent and Cigna and Humana each 18 percent.\n“Approximately 90 percent of Mr. Swedish’s total compensation is incentive-based, as compared with 80 percent for executive officers,” an Anthem spokesperson told The Post.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T04:24:34.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
