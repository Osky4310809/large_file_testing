Women and men marched for different personal reasons, and we were so inspired to see such powerful support. Taylor Swift supported the Women’s March, but it turned out to be very controversial. In fact, when Taylor tweeted her support, she was met with a ton of backlash. Fans criticized the way that she chose to support the march. But we think that kind of criticism fights against the premise of the march.\nTaylor Swift tweeted this message of support for the Women’s March. So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched. I'm proud to be a woman today, and every day. #WomensMarch \n— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) January 21, 2017 Taylor said, “So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched. I’m proud to be a woman today, and every day. # WomensMarch” We think that’s an awesome, supportive message. And we agree, because we were totally proud to be women, whether we were at the march or not.\nCriticism for Taylor essentially boiled down to fans being upset that she supported the Women’s March without actually attending. Especially because so many celebrities were active and present at the march, people claimed that Taylor’s gesture wasn’t big enough. But we don’t agree with that. Because we think Taylor should be allowed to support the march in whatever way she wants.\nThe Women’s March was all about people standing up to make their voices heard, because all of our voices matter. The Washington Post / Getty Seeing all these incredible women flood the street to proclaim their positive messages was so inspiring. And we think that everyone’s reasons and purpose for being out there was valid. And that includes those who did NOT want to march, like Taylor.\nIf we’re going to be part of a movement that supports all women’s voices, then we should also support Taylor’s decision to support the march from a distance. We don’t know what might be going on in Taylor’s life. We don’t know the details of her exact politics. And we don’t need to know that. We appreciate her support, however she chose to give it. And we think all of us should challenge ourselves to find ways to support each other as much as possible, rather than focusing on the negative.\nWe’d love to steer the movement in a direction where we stop criticizing each other for HOW we participate. Gary Miller / Getty That’s not the important place to focus our energy. We need to band together and support each other in whatever way we choose to support. Plus, showing everyone that the people behind the Women’s March are a positive, safe community of awesome people can only help the movement grow. So rather than finding fault in the people who do support the Women’s March, we should be harnessing the collective positive energy we just created. Because by using that positive energy, we can build on our message to make real change that benefits us all.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:43:30.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
