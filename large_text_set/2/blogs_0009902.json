I don’t have much time to do extra shifts to earn money but I do them where I can fit them in so that I have money to live off. \n“I had absolutely no money for a funeral, they’re very expensive, but I wanted to give my dad a proper send off.” Beccy has called on rules to be changed after she was sent a letter from DWP denying her help (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nBecause of her tight budget, Beccy was left having to hold a basic funeral for her father - with only one set of flowers and without funeral cars for herself or her family - however the cost still came to £3,500. \nShe said: “I ended up having to hold the most basic service, with only one set of flowers, the cheapest coffin and I couldn’t even afford funeral costs. My mum ended up driving me to the funeral which wasn’t nice for her given her upset.” \nAfter using the £600 left in her father’s bank account when he died, it left Beccy £2,900 in debt. \nHowever, despite applying to the DWP for help with the funeral costs, she received a letter stating she would not be entitled to any help. \nIt reads: “We are sorry to hear about your bereavement. On January 3 2017 you made a claim for a funeral payment from the Social Fund. We have decided that you are not entitled to a payment” \nShe has now called on the government to change the rules regarding who can apply for help for funerals, in the hope that other students aren’t affected in the same way. \n“I feel like I’m being penalised because I’m a student. I work 30 hours a week as well as assignments on top, but I barely have enough money to live off without paying for a funeral too.

I was advised that if I wanted help with funeral costs I’d need to leave uni and sign up for benefits. \n“It was a very stressful time in my life and it’s only made it worse.” \nA Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “Our sympathies are with Miss Oxley at this difficult time. Funeral Payments provide an important safety net for people on benefits, covering the cost of a basic burial or cremation. \n\"This ensures we have a sustainable system that supports those most in need, while also being fair to the taxpayer.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:25:06.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
