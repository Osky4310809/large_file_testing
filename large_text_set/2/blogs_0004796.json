While attempting to orchestrate a game-winning drive against a team led by former NFL quarterback Doug Flutie, Cousins drove his team down to the 1-yard line with a completion in the middle of the field with the clock running, per SI.com . It looked as though the referee did not spot the ball quickly enough for Cousins' liking, as shown by Sports Illustrated : Sports Illustrated @SInow Video: Kirk Cousins did not like that lack of hustle from a volunteer referee in a charity flag game https://t.co/1N6gLrcPcE https://t.co/Z3pbcVItqg 2/5/2017, 3:00:34 AM The referee, who was a volunteer, spoke with Timothy Burke of Deadspin about the incident: \nHe was fired up because he was losing and running out of time. Then the other team knocked the ball away while I was trying to set it for play. He wanted me to flag him for swatting it, but what he doesn’t know is that we were enforcing another penalty and it was going to give him another down. He never apologized or even showed any kind of regret. That’s ok though... everyone else gets to see how he is. Cousins has raised some eyebrows in the past for postgame outbursts , but going off on a volunteer official at a charity flag football game is probably taking things a bit too far.
