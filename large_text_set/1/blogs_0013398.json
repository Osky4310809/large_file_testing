Activism makes a difference. If you don’t like what’s happening in Washington, then get involved,” said Polly Baca, a former Colorado state lawmaker who participated in the 1963 March on Washington. Helen H. Richardson, The Denver Post Ann Mitchell, just hands shown, puts the finishing touches on a pussyhat as, from left to right in the back Jen Grant, Julie Piller and Debbie Asmus help to knit dozens of pink hats at the home of Jen Grant on Jan. 15, 2017 in Lafayette. \nBaca, 75, said she is returning to the capital city to once again fight for civil rights, a cause she said is all the more important given Trump’s talk of building a border wall or dismantling the Affordable Care Act . \n“We care about the civil rights of women. We care about the civil rights of minorities and refugees and immigrants,” she said. “We care about the civil rights of clean energy and air.” \nThe Washington march will be the main opposition event over the weekend, but other causes are using the time, too, to organize. They will descend on the city even as Trump supporters from Colorado and across the country travel to D.C. to celebrate his victory, including one group of motorcycle enthusiasts called Bikers for Trump . \nMarijuana enthusiasts are preparing to distribute 4,200 free joints on Friday; left-leaning lawyers have planned a two-day conference to discuss legal resistance; and the American Federation of Government Employees is urging its union members to march. \nPete Maysmith, the executive director of Conservation Colorado, said he will march Saturday in Washington alongside his wife and two daughters. The reason is to show solidarity with the event’s organizers and to represent Colorado’s environmental movement. \n“I’m going in part to give voice to all of us at Conservation Colorado,” he said. “This is about saying that we value our wide-open spaces, we value our blue skies. We know that our future is in wind and solar and clean energy. We know that public lands have to stay in public hands.” \nIn Colorado, about 29,000 people have expressed interest on Facebook in joining the march and rally in downtown Denver. But organizers say the final number could reach up to 40,000. \nPeople will start gathering at the Voorhies Memorial in Civic Center park by 9 a.m. and will begin marching at 9:30 a.m. \nA rally in the park, scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., will feature 16 local speakers and performers from a range of backgrounds, including author Fawn Germer, musician Cris Williamson and state Sen. Irene Aguilar. \nBeyond Denver, other Colorado marches are planned for Aspen, Carbondale, Colorado Springs, Durango, Grand Junction and Steamboat Springs. \nOne Denverite traveling to Washington said she bought a plane ticket before Election Day with the goal of watching Hillary Clinton become the nation’s first female president. When Clinton lost, rather than cancel the trip, she chose to join the march. \n“I want to be part of this,” said Meredith Levy, 34. “I don’t want to look back and think I could have done more.” \nMany of the Colorado demonstrators said they had little interest in seeing Trump assume power Friday at noon. One exception is Dr. Emily Schneider, a Denver obstetrician and gynecologist. She said she plans to attend the inauguration Friday and the march Saturday. \n“While I may not have voted for him, it’s still a presidential inauguration,” said Schneider, who said she got her tickets through U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. “(Trump is) still going to be my president. It’s still breathtaking, this great change in power. It’s worth seeing history.” \nSchneider said it’s important to avoid describing Saturday’s march as a protest. “It’s about demonstrating peacefully that women matter, that women and their families matter,” said Schneider, who decried the sharp partisanship that has come to define U.S. politics. “I’m not anti-GOP,” she said. “I’m anti-GOP attacking women’s health.” \nTwo Democratic members of Colorado’s congressional delegation said they plan to attend the march in Washington: U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette and Jared Polis. Their colleague U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Arvada, will go to the one in Denver. Bennet hasn’t made a firm commitment but will try to attend either the D.C. march or one in Colorado. All the Democrats say they will attend Trump’s inauguration. \n“We need to ensure that this administration hears the voices of those who oppose its announced plans on health care, the environment, women’s reproductive rights and a host of other issues,” DeGette said in a statement. “I’ll be marching with Coloradans who are visiting just for this event.” \nPiller, who helped knit the pink hats, said the march and the Pussyhat Project has provided a much-needed outlet for her group of friends. “We just took this on with a vengeance,” she said. “It was kind of an assembly line of construction of hats.” \nBut she added that the Skein Gang already was looking ahead to the future. “When this project this over,” she said, “we are going to have to find another purpose.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T07:32:43.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
