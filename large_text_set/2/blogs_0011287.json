He sweats like a honey-glazed ham left floating and forgotten in a hot jacuzzi. \n“I need to hire a private detective,” he says. I am a private detective. I am going to bite your ass into 11 sections. \nThe man starts sobbing because he thinks you are going to bite his ass into 11 sections. He sprints out of your office and slams the door behind him. You spend the rest of the day sitting in your empty office and flipping through magazines looking for pictures of vegetables. Every time you find a picture of a vegetable, you pick up the phone on your desk and say the name of the vegetable. There is nobody on the other end of the phone, but you like imagining that you are telling someone about a vegetable. You do this for the rest of your life, then you go to the bathroom. No mysteries happen to you at all. \nThe End Start Over Share Your Results \nThe unhappy man lets out a sigh of relief. “Finally, some good news. What’s your name, detective?” My name is Sam Stonemarrow. Now, hold on there, pal. You're doing things all out of order. You tell me your name, and then I'll tell you mine. My name is John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help. \n“Mr. Stonemarrow, let me tell you my troubles. My name is Dusty Washcloth,” says the unhappy man. “I work for the National Museum of American History. I am their head of security, which means that it’s my job to wait until something gets stolen from the museum and then run around screaming. Last night, the museum was robbed, and a specimen was stolen from the Presidential Fossils exhibit. I immediately began running around screaming, for which I was commended. I’ve since spent the past three days bursting into random offices and asking if the people who work there are detectives.” All right, well, you've found your detective. Now, why don't you tell me what was taken? \n“Mr. Stonemarrow, let me tell you my troubles,” says Dusty Washcloth. “I work for the Smithsonian Museum of American History. I am their head of security, which means that it’s my job to wait until something gets stolen from the museum and then run around screaming. Last night, the museum was robbed, and a specimen was stolen from the Presidential Fossils exhibit. I immediately began running around screaming, for which I was commended. I’ve since spent the past three days bursting into random offices and asking if the people who work there are detectives.” Well, you've found your detective. Now, why don't you tell me what was taken? \nThe unhappy man shudders like a rooster who has seen two monsters shaking hands. “The item that was taken was none other than Abraham Lincoln’s fossilized tooth! You must recover the tooth! It is the only part of Lincoln’s body that still exists! Please say you’ll take the case, Mr. Stonemarrow!” Mr. Washcloth, your story is very moving, and of course my softer nature inclines me to assist you. But I'm afraid I can't do anything at all until you clear up one crucial detail. \n“And what’s that?” What's in it for me? \n“My employer is willing to offer you a huge and wonderful thing in exchange for the safe return of Lincoln’s tooth,” says Dusty Washcloth. “The Smithsonian recently put a beaver’s brain inside Ronald Reagan’s corpse as part of the museum’s initiative to conduct fucked-up experiments that don’t help anyone. Now Reagan’s corpse has the mind of a beaver, and he keeps smacking things with his ass in an effort to build a dam while yelling the word ‘Remorse!’ over and over again. If you bring us Lincoln’s tooth, we will give you beaver-Reagan as your personal secretary.” I've always wanted a secretary. You've got yourself a deal, Mr. Washcloth. I've always wondered what it would be like if Reagan became a nauseating beaver-man who tried to construct dams using his ass. Sorry, Mr. Washcloth, but my normal fee is that you have to dump a pile of loose cigarettes onto my porch every morning for the rest of my life. \n“What a relief!” says Dusty Washcloth. “I’m so glad you’re accepting this case! You’ve got to find Lincoln’s tooth. I’ll be waiting for you at the museum whenever you want to begin your investigation. Goodbye, Mr. Stonemarrow.” \nDusty Washcloth takes another large gulp of mouthwash, gargles with it, and spits it directly into your face. “I also gargle with mouthwash when I’m very happy,” he explains. “When something good happens to me, I spit mouthwash all over the place. I call it ‘Wet Fireworks.’” He stands up and leaves your office. Yeah, see you bright and early at the museum, Mr. Washcloth. Write the words \"He's leaving\" on a piece of paper, then throw the paper in the garbage. \nSolitude passes Dusty Washcloth in the doorway and slips into your office as he exits. It lets itself in. It knows you won’t mind, and besides, you’re familiar enough with one another to dispense with formalities. \nYou pour yourself a double of Cruel Boy’s Bourbon and light a cigarette. The thick, black smoke coats your tongue with a protective layer of sludge and suffocates the dangerous bacteria that live in your lungs. It’s healthier than a tomato. The shadows grow long across your floor to announce the sunset, and you close the blinds to choke out the glare. You have no time for windows. Windows are just garage doors for birds, and birds are just distractions that lay eggs. You have no time for distractions. \nEspecially now that you have a case. It's never too early to get started. Go to the Smithsonian and start investigating Abraham Lincoln's stolen tooth fossil. Dwell on your past. \nYou think about your past. All your regrets. All the unbearable things you’ve seen and all the unbearable things you’ve done. You sneeze so hard that your pants fall down. Your boxer shorts have pictures of your face wearing a propellor beanie on them. Pull up your pants. Stand in the dark with your pants down. \nYou choose to bravely stand in the dark with your pants down. You stand this way for a long time. At one point, a man with an easel walks into your office and paints a full-scale oil painting of you standing there wth your pants down. When he is finished painting you, he packs up his easel and leaves. You never find out who he is. That's enough standing around in the dark. Time to go to the Smithsonian and look for Abraham Lincoln's stolen tooth fossil. \nYou’ve had it with waiting around. Your policy on solving crime is the same as your policy on drinking bourbon: It’s never too early in the day to start. You toss your revolver into your gun pouch and leave your office. \nYou arrive at the Smithsonian Museum. You better go inside and start investigating. Enter the museum. \nYou step into the lobby of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The museum was founded in 1790 when George Washington ordered this enormous building to be constructed so that he could sit in a glass cube with his shirt off and American citizens could come look at him. George Washington spent the majority of his presidency in a glass cube on display in the Smithsonian with no shirt on. He believed it would be educational for Americans to get to see what the president looked like with his shirt off. For a long time, that was the only exhibit, and people came from all over the country to see shirtless George Washington. Since then, the museum has added many new exhibits, but none of them were ever as popular as the shirtless George Washington’s dead-fish exhibit. Go meet Dusty Washcloth in the Presidential Fossils Wing. \nOn your way through the lobby, you pass the statue of George Washington with his shirt off that the museum had installed after he died so that Americans could still understand what George Washington looked like with his shirt off even though he was being tortured eternally in Heaven. At the base of the statue is the inscription “Taking my shirt off is the only thing that ever made me smile,” attributed to Washington. Wave to the statue as you walk by. Bow to the statue as you walk by. Don't even look at the goddamn statue. Wink at the statue as you walk by. \nYou wink at the statue of shirtless George Washington, and you’re immediately confronted by two Navy Seals who tell you that it’s absolutely forbidden to wink at the statues. They’ve taken the vow of silence that all Navy Seals take when they join, so they have to hold a sign with the message written on it. It is the sacred duty of Navy Seals to guard statues of U.S. presidents in museums around the world and make sure that nobody winks at them. I'm sorry for winking at the statue. Thank you for protecting presidential statues all over the world. I see that you are upholding the official Navy Seal motto, \"It takes two Navy Seals to hold a single sign.\" Thank you for protecting our statues from people winking at them. \nYou leave the Navy Seals and enter the Presidential Fossils exhibit. This is a famous wing of the Smithsonian where all the fossilized bones of America’s old presidents are tossed into a big pile in the middle of the room for people to look at. All the presidents’ bones are mixed together for convenience of viewing. Wait for Dusty Washcloth. \nYou walk past the statue and enter the Presidential Fossils exhibit. This is a famous wing of the Smithsonian where all the fossilized bones of America’s old presidents are tossed into a big pile in the middle of the room for people to look at. All the presidents’ bones are mixed together for convenience of viewing. Wait for Dusty Washcloth. \nYou look at the bones. It’s a whole big salad of all the best and worst presidents together. It’s very educational. Suddenly you hear a voice behind you: “Can I help you?” Look behind you by turning around. Look behind you by rotating your head 180 degrees. \nYou rotate your head 180 degrees such that your head is facing backwards on your body. The woman who was standing behind you looks at you in horror. “What on earth is wrong with you?” she screams. “You’re a monster!” Do not be alarmed by the fact that my head is now backwards! I am a detective! Stop being afraid! It is normal to have your head be reversed in this manner! Hello, lady! Look at me in all my unnatural horror! I am an affront to God's design, and you know what? That makes me feel happy and hungry! Oh, holy God, my head is backwards now! Why did I do this? I should have just turned around normally! Please help me, ma'am! You must put me to sleep with a massive blow to the head! I am in an enormous amount of pain! \n“Stay away from me!” screams the woman. She presses a button on the wall. Beneath the button is a placard that reads, “PRESS IN CASE OF FIRE OR TERRIBLE MONSTER.” A loud alarm starts blaring throughout the museum. A voice comes over the intercom and says, “Warning. The museum is either on fire or under attack from some hideous monster that can swivel its head around. Please run screaming from the museum as fast as you can. Kill anyone who is running slower than you.” \nEveryone in the museum starts screaming and sprinting toward the exits as fast as they can. People rip each other to pieces in their insane scramble for escape. People throw themselves from windows or run straight through the walls just to get away from you. Chaos and carnage rule the day at the National Museum of American History. Make a mental note that, from now on, you're just going to turn around the normal way instead of rotating your head 180 degrees. Make a mental note that rotating your head 180 degrees is truly amazing…perhaps the only good way to look at something that's behind you. \nYou decide to learn nothing from this whole fiasco and choose instead to spend the rest of your life always rotating your head around on your neck like a furious gyroscope. But sadly, it looks like you may never get the chance, because the alarm has attracted Sensei Randal’s Intermediate Karate Squadron. These kids have studied karate under Sensei Randal for at least six months, and now they wander the world administering vigilante justice. “We are here to use the sacred teachings of Sensei Randal to kill the backward-headed monster terrorizing the museum!” shouts Dale Oaks, a 15-year-old blue belt from Grand Rapids, MI. Try to fight Sensei Randal's Intermediate Karate Squadron. Let Sensei Randal's Intermediate Karate Squadron kill you. \nYou make a mental note never to swivel your head like a freak ever again, but sadly it’s too late, because the alarm has attracted Sensei Randal’s Intermediate Karate Squadron. These kids have studied karate under Sensei Randal for at least six months, and now they wander the world administering vigilante justice. “We are here to use the sacred teachings of Sensei Randal to kill the backward-headed monster terrorizing the museum!” shouts Dale Oaks, a 15-year-old blue belt from Grand Rapids, MI. Try to fight Sensei Randal's Intermediate Karate Squadron. Let Sensei Randal's Intermediate Karate Squadron kill you. \nYou decide it would be more efficient for everyone if you just let Sensei Randal’s Intermediate Karate Squadron go ahead and kill you. Sensei Randal’s motto is “The only thing in karate is karate chops,” so that’s all he teaches his students day in and day out for years. As a result, these kids are extremely bad at almost all of karate, but extremely good at karate chops. They karate-chop you in the legs until you die. \nThe next day the front page of the paper reads “Monster Plaguing Museum Killed By Children Who Still Need To Get Better At Karate.” \nThe End Start Over Share Your Results \nYou try to fight off Sensei Randal’s Intermediate Karate Squadron. Sadly, Sensei Randal’s motto is “The only thing in karate is karate chops,” so that’s all he teaches his students day in and day out for years. As a result, these kids are extremely bad at almost all of karate, but they’re extremely good at karate chops. You’re simply no match for their karate-chop skills, and they karate-chop you in the legs until you die. \nThe next day the front page of the paper reads “Monster Plaguing Museum Killed By Children Who Still Need To Get Better At Karate.” \nThe End Start Over Share Your Results \nYou turn around and find yourself looking into a pair of eyes so dark and deep you could hide a bag of stolen sneakers inside of them for 1,000 years without anyone ever finding them. “My name is Eileen Osiris,” says the voice that belongs to those eyes. “I’m the curator of the Smithsonian museum. A museum curator is someone who thinks about old treasures and decides which ones are good to look at and which ones belong at the bottom of the ocean. I am queen of the past.” Politely shriek, \"Hubba, hubba!\" My name's Stonemarrow. Private detective. \nYou politely shriek, “Hubba, hubba!” \n“You’re very polite,” says the dame with the eyes. “What’s your name?” My name's Stonemarrow. I'm a private detective. \n“You got a first name, Detective Stonemarrow?” Yeah, it's Sam. But only my friends call me Sam. \n“It’s nice to meet you, Sam,” says Eileen Osiris. “You must be here to help us figure out what happened to our stolen Abraham Lincoln tooth. Is there anything I can do to help?” Yeah. I'm supposed to meet a fellow named Washcloth. The security guard. You seen him around? All I want to do is look at Dusty Washcloth. Bring me the man named Washcloth. Lady, I'm gaga for Washcloth. I'm a Washcloth boy, and I need to look at him. \n“I’m sorry, Sam,” says Eileen Osiris. “But Dusty Washcloth has gone missing. He left work yesterday to go to city hall to use the city’s only toilet, but he never came back. And then after that, he was murdered. His body was found at the city’s only toilet. Someone shot him in his Essential Lemon, which is the most important part of the body. I’m very worried about him because I don’t know where he is and because he was murdered.” So you're telling me that we've got a missing presidential tooth AND a missing security guard who has been murdered? This case just got a lot more complicated. Looks like I'm going to have to promote myself from \"detective\" to \"detective's dad.\" Often I have said to myself, \"The city needs more than one toilet,\" and yet our mayor restricts us all to a single toilet at city hall. This is a bad place to live. \n“The fact that we only have one toilet is both this city’s crowning achievement, and its greatest curse,” says Eileen Osiris. “Sam, will you do me a favor?” Anything for a knife-eyed dame like you. I guess. I'll do whatever. I have no plans for the next 15 years. \n“Congratulations on your promotion to detective’s dad,” says the dame. “And now,” she adds, “I’m afraid I need to ask you for a huge favor.” Anything for a knife-eyed dame like you. I guess. I'll do whatever. I have no plans for the next 15 years. \n“Please find out what happened to the stolen tooth of Abraham Lincoln. It’s what Dusty Washcloth would have wanted.” Okay. I'll do it if it's what Dusty Washcloth would have wanted. \nYou step out of the museum and into the wet embrace of the city. The sprawling metropolis is noisy and beautiful like a screaming warthog wearing a pearl necklace. Avenues and alleyways spider out across the sprawl, insinuating a Sodom’s worth of sin around every shadowy corner. But you and these streets ran each other ragged long ago, and you’ve sucked their mystery dry. You know the answers to all their riddles and the punchlines to all their jokes. And you know that, for all the illusion of infinite paths, when something goes missing that needs finding, a man who truly knows this city has only one solitary, inescapable destination: Tugboat’s Pub. Ah, yes. Tugboat's Pub: the seediest saloon in the whole damn harbor. \nThat’s right, Tugboat’s Pub: the seediest saloon in the whole damn harbor. The joint draws in crowds for its gin and exotic birds from far-off lands that quote the Bible, but it draws in loners for its illicit dealings and unseemly hearsay. Forget the booze. Tugboat’s most valuable commodity is its surplus of lowlives who keep their ears to the ground. When a crime gets committed in this city, one of the venerable dirtbags at Tugboat’s hears about it, so long as they weren’t the perp in the first place. You better get down there and start asking around about Abe Lincoln’s stolen tooth. Make tracks to Tugboat's Pub. \nYou arrive at the harbor. Proceed to Tugboat's Pub. \nYou slink along the boardwalk and find yourself standing outside of Tugboat’s Pub. From inside, you can hear the sounds of miscellaneous debauchery and a frantic piano playing the popular harbor anthem “The Only Good Place To Get Vaccinated Is The Open Ocean.” Go inside. \nYou enter Tugboat’s Pub. The smell of stale booze rushes you at the door like it wants to take your coat. The full index of Encyclopedia Of Scoundrels is here tonight, and you’re sure that one of their sticky fingers can point you in the right direction. Where would you like to begin your investigation? Investigate the bar. Investigate the VIP lounge. \nYou enter Tugboat’s Pub. The smell of stale booze rushes you at the door like it wants to take your coat. The full index of Encyclopedia Of Scoundrels is here tonight, and you’re sure that one of their sticky fingers can point you in the right direction. Where would you like to begin your investigation? Investigate the bar. Investigate the VIP lounge. \nYou walk to the back of the bar where the VIP lounge lives. The VIP lounge is extremely exclusive. It’s where some of the most glamorous and famous criminals go to pay exotic birds to quote the Bible while they think about bootlegging things. You try to enter, but a bouncer stops you at the door. “Hold up, doofus. This is a restricted area. If you’re not on my list, I need to send you to the Rejection Lounge.” I'm on the list. Pal, you might as well just send me to that nasty lounge, because the only lists I've ever been on in my life is America's 100 Most Permanent Scowls. \n“Oh yeah, what’s your name?” My name is Sam Stonemarrow. My name is John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help. \nThe bouncer screams with rage. His punches a hole through his own head, which makes him healthier and more furious. “You’re John Problem? I despise you. My brother asked you for directions to the sewer, and you shot him in the hair. He died from hair wounds! I’m going to do revenge near to your lungs to cause you troubles!” Wait, I lied! I'm not John Problem! I'm Sam Stonemarrow! What can I say, baby? That's what happens when you ask John Problem for help! You get killed! I regret nothing. I wish your brother had two heads so that I could shoot him in the hair a second time. \n“Don’t try to lie your way out of this one, John Problem. I’m going to have my revenge on you at last.” The bouncer moves toward you with his hands reaching for your soft and valuable head. Well, I guess you reap what you sow. Buy yourself some time by asking for one last cigarette before the bouncer gets his revenge. \nYou decide to really double down on telling the bouncer that you’re John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help. This really makes him furious.“John Problem, you are as smug as you are horrible,” says the bouncer. “I’m going to have my revenge on you at last.” The bouncer moves toward you with his hands reaching for your soft and valuable head. Well, I guess you reap what you sow. Buy yourself some time by asking for one last cigarette before the bouncer gets his revenge. \n“All right,” says the bouncer, “but once your billow stick is ashed out, I’m going to do revenge nearby to your lungs so as to cause you troubles.” Reach into your pocket and light up a cigarette. \nWith the kind of hero’s hand that has never been sweaty, you pull a Plume Spouter Ultra premium cigarette out of your pocket and light it up. The nine essential nutritious fumes contained in cigarette smoke choke your brain in the healing fog of wisdom, and now you can think clearly. A plan slides silently into your mind like a thief into an art gallery. You’re ready to take action. Hey, pal, I've got one cigarette left. It's not gonna be of much use to me in the afterlife. Would you like it? \n“Yeah, give it to me,” says the bouncer. Hand the bouncer your cigarette. Say, \"This is part of my plan to destroy you,\" while handing the bouncer your cigarette. \nThe bouncer lights up the cigarette and starts yawning down its beautiful fumes. Hey, everyone! Look! Two guys smoking cigarettes at the same time! Everybody, behold! A miracle has come to pass right before your eyes! Two men smoking cigarettes at the exact same time! People of America, come to understand the freak incident that has come to pass: Two men are smoking cigarettes, and they are not doing so one at a time, but are in fact smoking the cigarettes at the same exact time! Oh, my sweet and bonkers Christ! Can you possibly believe it? Two men have become what the ancient Greeks called \"twins of the plume,\" and what I mean by that is that two men are smoking cigarettes at THE EXACT SAME TIME! Come look at this disgusting proof that God exists and has gone bananas. \n“I don’t care about that,” says the bouncer. He lights up the cigarette and starts yawning down its beautiful fumes. Hey, everyone! Look! Two guys smoking cigarettes at the same time! Everybody, behold! A miracle has come to pass right before your eyes! Two men smoking cigarettes at the exact same time! People of America, come to understand the freak incident that has come to pass: Two men are smoking cigarettes, and they are not doing so one at a time, but are in fact smoking the cigarettes at the same exact time! Oh, my sweet and bonkers Christ! Can you possibly believe it? Two men have become what the ancient Greeks called, \"twins of the plume,\" and what I mean by that is that two men are smoking cigarettes at THE EXACT SAME TIME! Come look at this miracle! \nAs soon as you scream this, a swarm of paparazzi immediately bursts into Tugboat’s Pub and surrounds you and the bouncer. “I cannot believe the miracle of two at once!” yells one of the paparazzo, snapping your picture from as many angles as he can. “Two men, two cigarettes, one moment in time! A miracle I thought I’d never live to see!” yells another paparazzo. “I’ve heard of one man smoking a cigarette, but TWO men smoking a cigarette is the beautiful type of miracle that makes me insane!” yells a third paparazzo. \nThe paparazzi create complete chaos all around you. Everyone wants a shot of two men smoking the same type of thing at the same exact time. Some of them kill each other. “Stop it!” the bouncer screams. “Everyone calm down!” But nobody listens to him. The flashbulb rules the day, and in the complete mayhem, you are free to escape. Sneak past the bouncer into the VIP lounge. Wait for the chaos to die down so that the bouncer can kill you. \nYou sneak past the bouncer and enter the VIP lounge. The air in this room is thick with incense and sin. Eddies of cigar smoke ring wavy halos around dim, red-tinted lights. The sole occupant of this sauna of mischief is a man sitting in a velvet chair. “Hello,” says the man. “I am thinking about bootlegging various things, such as counterfeit moccasins and fake raisins.” Who are you? \n“Pardon me, but I am Big Excuse Me,” says the man. “I am a gangster who loves to bootleg things. Is there something I can help you with? I came here to the VIP lounge to watch a bird quote the Bible, and I don’t have any patience for distractions.” Well, let me pay for another round of birds quoting the Bible for you, friend, and then we'll talk business. I hear that you know a thing or two about a certain tooth that was stolen from the Smithsonian museum. \n“Perhaps I do,” says Big Excuse Me. “Perhaps I will tell you my secret, but I only tell secrets to my friends, and the only friends I have are the ones who buy me a round of birds quoting the Bible for our shared entertainment.” Well, let me pay for another round of birds quoting the Bible for you, friend, and then we'll talk business. \n“I’ve never been one to say no to a gift,” says Big Excuse Me. “I’d be much obliged.” Buy Big Excuse Me a round of birds to quote the Bible. \nYou throw a dollar onto the floor of the VIP lounge. A hatch in the wall opens up, and the most beautiful exotic bird you’ve ever seen struts out of it. The bird eats your money off of the ground then begins reciting the following Bible passage: \n“And then God spoke to Moses and said, ‘Moses, behold! I will give you a brand new type of vegetable called a ‘fish,’ and a single fish fell from Heaven and began flipping around on the ground and spraying its eggs all over the desert, and the eggs got eaten by scorpions, and Moses said unto the Lord, ‘I know all about fish, my Lord. They have been around for a long time,” and the Lord said to Moses, ‘No, a fish is a new thing from just now. I had the idea to invent this amazing new vegetable called a fish earlier today while I was rolling around on the ground in Heaven,’ and Moses said unto the Lord, ‘God, it is very exhausting to be your friend’ (Exodus, 9:15).” Applaud for the exotic bird. \nYou applaud for the exotic bird. Big Excuse Me is also applauding. “I love when the bird tells me the Bible,” says Big Excuse Me. “It is the only thing I like.” Okay, Big Excuse Me, we listened to the bird garble scripture. Now how about you tell me about that stolen tooth I'm looking for? Feed the bird another dollar so that it will quote another Bible verse. \n“I beg your pardon, but we aren’t quite friends yet,” says Big Excuse Me. “A true friend of mine would buy me one more round of birds quoting the Bible.” Sigh and buy Big Excuse Me another round of the bird quoting the good book. You drive a hard bargain, Big Excuse Me, but I guess I've got no choice. \nYou throw another dollar onto the ground. The beautiful bird eats the dollar off of the floor, looks you right in the eye, and quotes the following Bible verse: \n“And God said unto Moses, ’Moses, let me tell you what’s what: every night I sit on the toilet to do the Lord’s Piss, and while I am sitting there doing the Lord’s Piss, the Devil climbs up into Heaven with his long golden hair, and he squats down in front of the toilet like a baseball catcher and I brush Satan’s hair while I go to the bathroom.’ And Moses said unto the Lord, ‘O Lord, it sucks to know about this,’ and the Lord said to Moses, ‘Go and tell the children of Israel that God brushes Satan’s hair while he sits on the toilet,’ and Moses said, ‘I don’t want to tell them that. It will make them upset.’ And God became wrathful at Moses’ disobedience and decided to punish him. And so God sent a gorilla to come out of the desert and eat Moses’ sandals, and Moses said to God, ‘Oh, great job, God. Those were my only sandals,’ (Exodus, 9:15).” Applaud for the exotic bird. \nOnce again you clap your hands for the mysterious bird who comes from far away. Big Excuse Me has got a smile spread across his face wide enough to bridge a canal. “Just wonderful!” says the vicious gangster. All right, Big Excuse Me, we've heard two beautiful Bible verses. Now how about you give me the big-and-tall on the whereabouts of that tooth? Feed the bird another dollar so that it will quote another Bible verse. \n“I believe once more with the Bible and the bird, and then you will be my friend,” says Big Excuse Me. Jesus Christ. Okay. \nYou throw a third dollar onto the ground. The beautiful bird eats the dollar off of the floor, looks you right in the eye, and quotes the following Bible verse: \n“And God said to Moses, ‘Watch this,’ and the Lord made a Trans Am fall out of the sky and crash onto the ground and there was a man in the Trans Am and the man in the Trans Am got out of the car and showed Moses his ass. And Moses said, ‘O Lord, every day you find dazzling new ways to hinder me with your bullshit,’ and the Lord said, ‘Thank you,’ and Moses said, ‘It wasn’t a compliment,’ and the Lord said, ‘Let’s see that again in slow motion,’ and God made another Trans Am fall out of the sky at the exact same speed as before, but this time it fell through the roof of Moses’ house and the guy in the new Trans Am that the Lord had sent from Heaven got out of the Trans Am and he, too, showed Moses his ass. Then both Trans Am guys went inside of Moses’ house and drank all of the wine they found there, and Moses said, ‘Who is going to pay me back for all of this wine?’ and God said, ‘Moses will pay you back,’ and Moses said, ‘I am Moses,’ and God said, ‘Well, then I guess nobody’ (Exodus, 9:27).” Applaud for the exotic bird. \nYou once again burst into applause for the exotic bird. “Each time is more beautiful than the last,” sighs Big Excuse Me. Big Excuse Me, it's been wonderful listening to this bird croak out the good book, but we've done it three times and time isn't getting any slower. You've got to tell me what you know about that stolen tooth. Feed the bird another dollar so that it will quote another Bible verse. \nYou throw another dollar bill on the ground. The exotic bird eats it off of the floor then dies from eating way too much money. It is incredibly unhealthy for a bird to eat even one dollar, and you fed it four dollars. It got poisoned, and its stomach exploded at the same time. It will never quote the Bible again. Well, that's a real bummer. Anyway, what do you know about this presidential tooth that was stolen from the Smithsonian museum? \n“After this generous gift of bird that you have given me, I can tell you are a friend,” says Big Excuse Me, “and so I will play ball. In the bootlegging industry we have a common saying: ‘An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.’ It means that when someone rips out one of their eyes and hands it to you, it is polite to rip out one of your own eyes and give it to them. And when a stranger tells you about the location of a hidden tooth, then it is polite to tell them the location of a hidden tooth that you know about in return.” What are you getting at here, Big Excuse Me? That seems fair. \n“What I’m getting at is that I know where the stolen tooth of Abraham Lincoln is. I will tell you its location if you first tell me the location of a secret tooth that you know about.” I know about a tooth under a bench. I know about a tooth in a parking lot. I know about a tooth that a man is sitting on at the mall. \n“It is incredibly fair. We bootleggers have a deep and extremely dated sense of justice. So here is the deal: I know where the stolen tooth of Abraham Lincoln is. I will tell you its location if you first tell me the location of a secret tooth that you know about.” I know about a tooth under a bench. I know about a tooth in a parking lot. I know about a tooth that a man is sitting on at the mall. \n“How wonderful,” says Big Excuse Me. “I cannot wait to go look at that secret tooth. Now I will tell you this: The tooth you are looking for has found its way into the hands of a man named Julius Tube.” Who is Julius Tube? \n“No. You are the tight-lipped stranger who is my friend.” Who is Julius Tube? \n“Julius Tube is the co-owner of the Grand Matador Cinema. It’s the big movie theater downtown that people don’t really go to anymore.” You say he's the co-owner of the movie theater? Who's the other owner? What would the owner of a movie theater want with the fossilized tooth of Abraham Lincoln? \n“I don’t know who it is,” says Big Exuse Me. “I only know that Julius Tube was recently invited to the San Diego Zoo because the zookeeper wanted to show all the animals an example of a man who co-owned a movie theater. From this we must conclude that at least one other person has a stake in that theater.” That's a beautiful story about zoo animals. \n“The Grand Matador Cinema has recently fallen on hard times after they showed a screening of Gone With The Wind where each of the characters was somehow 250 pounds heavier for some reason. This caused great outrage, and very few people still go to the Grand Matador anymore. It’s possible that Julius wants to sell that stolen tooth for a king’s ransom to save his failing movie theater.” That's a heartbreaking story about a movie where everyone was heavier than normal. \n“Indeed it is,” says Big Excuse Me. “Do you have any other questions?” You say he's the co-owner of the movie theater? Who's the other owner? What would the owner of a movie theater want with the fossilized tooth of Abraham Lincoln? I'm all out of questions, Big Excuse. Right now I'm in the market for answers. I think it's time that I went and paid this Julius Tube character a visit. \nYou start walking out of the VIP lounge, leaving Big Excuse Me all alone with his vices. “Pardon me!” Big Excuse Me calls after you as you are about to make your exit. “Wait just a minute, detective!” Turn around to look at Big Excuse Me. Bend over and look at Big Excuse Me through your legs. \nYou turn around, and Big Excuse Me continues to speak. “You’ve been a good friend to me,” he says, “so why don’t you forget about that missing tooth of yours and join my bootlegging business? I’m about to create a counterfeit moon and profit by charging an entrance fee to the astronauts that land on it by accident.” Sorry, Big Excuse Me, I said I would find that tooth, and when a detective says a thing, they've got to do it. It's the only rule about being a detective. \nYou bend over and look at Big Excuse through your legs. The esteemed bootlegger continues to speak. “You’ve been a good friend to me,” he says, “so why don’t you forget about that missing tooth of yours and join my bootlegging business? I’m about to create a counterfeit moon and profit by charging an entrance fee to the astronauts that land on it by accident.” Sorry, Big Excuse Me, I said I would find that tooth, and when a detective says a thing, they've got to do it. It's the only rule about being a detective. \nYou leave Big Excuse Me alone with his problems and step out into the street. The empty night is desperate for company, and it welcomes you with a dark embrace. The sound of two criminals arguing about which one of them likes arson the most echoes through the evening. Your head is fat with new information, and you’re ready to continue your investigation. Go to the Grand Matador Cinema and confront Julius Tube about the stolen tooth. \nAs you walk through the darkness to the Grand Matador Cinema, you are stopped in your tracks by the form of a man draped in shadow. He is wearing a detective hat, so you know that he is a private eye like you. Who are you? Explain your identity into my mind! Howdy, fellow detective! \n“My name is John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help,” says the shadowy figure. “I just wanted to let you know that I’m also looking for the missing tooth. We’re both in this together, detective!” Okay, I understand. You're looking for the tooth as well? That's great! We could team up and look for it together! What do you say? Will you help me? \n“Howdy,” says the shadowy figure. “My name is John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help,” says the shadowy figure. “I just wanted to let you know that I’m also looking for the missing tooth. We’re both in this together, detective!” Okay, I understand. You're looking for the tooth as well? That's great! We could team up and look for it together! What do you say? Will you help me? \n“I’m going to keep looking for that tooth. I suggest you do the same,” says John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help. “Keep an eye out for me, detective. I might just pop up where you least expect it. Until then, so long.” John Problem turns and walks down the darkened street. You can see his detective hat disappear and reappear in rapid succession as he walks beneath a row of streetlights, and then he is gone around the corner. Shrug and continue walking to the Grand Matador Cinema. Mumble, \"Now ain't that just some kind of a thing,\" and continue walking to the Grand Matador Cinema. \nJohn Problem immediately punches you in the leg, which causes your head to burst into flames. The heat from the fire causes your brain to melt, and since the brain is the part of your body that controls your legs, your legs immediately start flailing all over the place like an electrocuted rag doll. One of your wildly flailing legs kicks you in the head, which causes you to die. \nWell, you asked for help from John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help, and he killed you right away. This makes a lot of sense, and it’s comforting to know that there are some reliable rules in a world largely governed by chaos. \nThe next day, the front page of the newspaper reads “Forgettable Detective Dies By Getting Kicked In The Head And Then Dies A Second Time From His Head Also Being On Fire.” The article features a full-color photo of your parents shrugging in front of your grave. \nThe End Start Over Share Your Results \nYou arrive at the Grand Matador Cinema. Tonight’s film is called The Hogg Brothers Run Over A Benevolent King . It is a film adaptation of the classic stage play of the same title. Go inside and buy a ticket. \nYou walk up to the box office, and your eyes are on fire with unbridled ticket lust. Your mind is swallowed by your unquenchable desire for tickets. “Hello. Welcome to the box office, home of tickets,” says the man in the box office. “How can I satisfy your ticket lust this evening?” I need one ticket to \"The Hogg Brothers Run Over A Benevolent King,\" please. Only 1,000 tickets to \"The Hogg Brothers Run Over A Benevolent King\" will satisfy my wild ticket lust. Jesus Christ, give me every ticket to every movie. I'm wild with ticket lust! \n“I’m afraid we’re only showing one movie at this time,” says the man in the box office. It’s The Hogg Brothers Run Over A Benevolent King. Furthermore, I’m afraid that we only have 1,000 tickets to that show. Christ. Okay. Well, give me all 1,000 tickets two times. \n“Excellent choice, sir,” says the man at the box office. “Here you go.” He hands you a wad of 1,000 tickets. Then you hand the tickets back to him. “Here you go,” says the man at the box office. He hands you the wad of 1,000 tickets again. At last my ticket lust is satisfied. Thank you, ticket man. Alas, my ticket lust is unfulfilled. Someday my ticket lust will drive me mad. Goodbye, ticket man. \n“Yes, of course. Very good choice,” says the man at the box office. He hands you 1,000 tickets. “Please enjoy the movie 1,000 times.” Thank you. Scowl and leave without a word. Your ticket lust has left you bitter. \n“Okay, here you go,” says the man in the box office. He hands you a ticket. “Enjoy the movie. I love you.” I love you too. \nYou step into the lobby of the Grand Matador Cinema. This place is full of tortured souls ogling the popcorn and silently hoping that the flickering glow of a projector is too scant a light source for their troubles to find them by. A mother and her two young children walk by you, talking about bullshit and nonesuch. Eavesdrop on the passing family. Ignore the passing family. \nThe family walks by you, then they are gone. Suddenly an alarm begins blaring. A firefighter walks into the lobby and starts picking people up one at a time and carrying them into the theater. The firefighter gently places each customer into a seat, then returns to the lobby to get the next customer. This means that the movie is about to begin. Let the firefighter carry you into the theater so that you can watch the movie. Skip the movie and confront Julius Tube. \nYou’re on your way to Julius Tube’s office when all of a sudden he walks right past you and goes into the movie theater! It looks like Julius Tube is planning to watch The Hogg Brothers Run Over A Benevolent King . Follow Julius Tube into the movie. Wait in Julius Tube's office until the movie ends. \nThe firefighter lifts you up, carries you into the theater, and places you in one of the seats. As you settle in to watch the movie, you see Julius Tube himself sitting in the front row wearing 3D glasses even though this isn’t a 3D movie. You’d better keep an eye on him so you can confront him after the movie. \nThe audience grows silent as the lights go down. The movie is about to begin. Start watching the movie. \nYou follow Julius Tube into the theater and take a seat toward the back. As you settle in to watch the movie, you see Julius Tube sitting in the front row wearing 3D glasses even though this isn’t a 3D movie. You’d better keep an eye on him so you can confront him after the movie. \nThe audience grows silent as the lights go down. The movie is about to begin. Start watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \n[Enter GORDON HOGG. He looks into the camera and speaks.] \nGordon Hogg: Here I am. Gordon Hogg. The eldest of the three Hogg brothers. I love my brothers too much. In fact, the only two things I like are looking at my brothers through a telescope and hugging my brothers in a way that makes people want to call the police. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nGordon Hogg: I was just now driving down the highway at top speed in my race car. I was on my way to Brother Canyon to watch my brothers do gymnastics to each other, but on the way, a disaster decided to marry me. The disaster was this: I plowed my race car right into a benevolent king who was trying to walk across the highway. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nGordon Hogg: Alas, the force of my race car plowing into the benevolent king turned the king’s skeleton into a special type of pretzel that was challenging to understand. I said to the benevolent king, “Your majesty, please do not yell at my race car even though it turned your skeleton into a kaleidoscope,” and the benevolent king said, “I am too benevolent to be angry. I love you. I am going to make your groin the Duke of Stray Dogs,” and the benevolent king sneezed on my groin to make my groin an aristocrat, and I said, “Thank you, your majesty,” and then I got out of my car and walked away. I think the benevolent king is still lying on the ground. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nGordon Hogg: But hark! I hear the noise of man’s shoe doing a closeness in my direction. From the noise of the foot, I can tell that it is my middle brother, Prentice Hogg. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \n[Enter PRENTICE HOGG.] \nPrentice Hogg: Hello, my brother Gordon Hogg. I love you too much. \nGordon Hogg: Hello, Prentice Hogg, my brother. I was just thinking about looking at you through a telescope while you did R-rated push-ups on a distant mountain peak. I love you too much. I find God to be terrible. How are you today? \nPrentice Hogg: The incurable disease known as brother fever has poisoned my blood, and at any second it will kill me. I wish a gorilla would crumple God up into a ball and slam dunk him through a basketball hoop for two points. Beyond that, I have just come from the highway, where a terrible new disaster decided to make me its wife. The disaster was this: I was driving my race car at top velocity down the highway when I saw a benevolent king lying mangled on the pavement. The benevolent king stood up and said, “I survived getting run over by Gordon Hogg! It’s a miracle!” and at that moment, I plowed into him with my race car and turned his skeleton into the type of knot that Boy Scouts win trophies for. \nGordon Hogg: I scream with horror to hear of it! Was the benevolent king furious about his skeleton? Did he yell at your race car? Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nPrentice Hogg: The benevolent king did not yell at my race car. He was too benevolent to be angry. Instead, he made my groin the Duke of Hyenas and Vultures, and he sneezed on my groin to make my groin into an aristocrat. If there is a hyena or a vulture anywhere around, my groin is the one who is in charge of it. Maybe my groin will command all the hyenas and vultures in the kingdom to eat each other and have sex with each other at the same time. \nGordon Hogg: Now I understand the shape of the disaster you had on the highway. God is the kind of warthog I love to throw my laundry at. \nPrentice Hogg: I have invented a special kind of hamburger called Brother Salad, which is when you mix spider webs and marinara sauce together in a bowl and feed it to your brother while he is doing R-rated push-ups. \nGordon Hogg: Prentice Hogg, my brother, I love to dream about thinking about your special new type of hamburger. I crave your private hamburger now more than ever. My groin is the master of stray dogs by decree of the king. \nPrentice Hogg: I wish a master hibachi chef would slice God into six pieces and flip them one by one into my landlord’s mouth to the delight of everyone in the restaurant. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nPrentice Hogg: Hark! I hear the sounds of a man’s legs doing a walk! From the sound of the shoe noise, I can realize that it is our youngest brother, Whipple Hogg. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \n[Enter WHIPPLE HOGG.] \nWhipple Hogg: Hello my two brothers. I love you too much. God is the type of nasty vegetable that I love to put inside of a volcano. \nPrentice Hogg: Hello, Whipple Hogg. You are my brother, and Gordon Hogg is my brother. I have a Ph.D. in looking at you through a telescope. \nGordon Hogg: How are you doing today, Whipple Hogg, my brother? \nWhipple Hogg: I’m afraid that I have become a disaster’s bride. I was driving down the highway in my race car at the biggest miles-per-hour possible when I saw a benevolent king lying in the road. The benevolent king stood up and said, “I have survived being run over by Gordon Hogg AND Prentice Hogg! I am the luckiest king alive!” and that is when I plowed into him with my race car and caused his skeleton to reorganize itself in the type of way that would make a doctor quit his job. \nPrentice Hogg: Did the benevolent king yell at your race car? Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nWhipple Hogg: No. The king was too benevolent to yell at my race car. Instead, he sneezed on my groin to make it an aristocrat. My groin is now the Duke of Frogs. I love that my groin can boss the frogs around. \nPrentice Hogg: Congratulations, Whipple Hogg, my brother. If my landlord does not eat God in the next 10 minutes, I am going to become a terrorist. \nGordon Hogg: What happened to the benevolent king? \nWhipple Hogg: I picked up the benevolent king and threw him as far as I could in the direction of the nearest hospital, but he only went a few feet, and then when he landed a group of scorpions teamed up to eat all of his meat. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nAll Three Hogg Brothers In Unison: And so we three Hogg brothers have all run over a benevolent king. Our groins have become aristocrats, and they command the vermin of this kingdom. We hope our groins rule over the dirty animals of the Earth with wisdom and kindness, and then we hope our groins become lunatics who command the dirty animals to go to the bathroom all over the place. Now we will go to Brother Canyon to do R-rated push-ups and eat the secret hamburger called Brother Salad. We hope God the monster gets chased off a cliff by a professional hockey team. We love each other too much, and we are going to do gymnastics to each other for 100 years. Amen. Keep watching the movie. Leave the movie and go wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nThe Hogg Brothers Run Over A Benevolent King has come to an end. Everyone in the theater is on their feet giving the film a much-deserved standing ovation. It is quite simply the greatest film ever made. \nOut of the corner of your eye, you see Julius Tube get out of his seat and leave the theater. Follow Julius Tube to his office. \nYou slip out of the theater and sneak behind Julius Tube as he walks back to his office. You accidentally follow him too quickly, and you end up getting to his office before he does, which is a little embarrassing. You’ll have to wait until he gets here. \nA man sitting at a typewriter looks up at you. “Hello,” says the man. “I’m Mr. Tube’s personal assistant. My name is Juan Problemo.” Nice to meet you, Mr. Problemo. Mind if I wait around here for your boss? Juan Problemo…any relation to Oscar Problemo? \nEven though this is the greatest movie you have ever seen, you decide to slip out of the theater so that you can wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nYou enter Julius Tube’s office and see a man sitting at a typewriter. He looks up at you. “Hello,” says the man. “I’m Mr. Tube’s personal assistant. My name is Juan Problemo.” Nice to meet you, Mr. Problemo. Mind if I wait around here for your boss? Juan Problemo…any relation to Oscar Problemo? \nYou decide to skip the movie and just wait for Julius Tube in his office. \nYou enter Julius Tube’s office and see a man sitting at a typewriter. He looks up at you. “Hello,” says the man. “I’m Mr. Tube’s personal assistant. My name is Juan Problemo.” Nice to meet you, Mr. Problemo. Mind if I wait around here for your boss? Juan Problemo…any relation to Oscar Problemo? \n“No.” Okay. Mind if I wait around until your boss gets in, Mr. Problemo? \n“Be my guest,” says Juan Problemo. He goes back to typing. Silently wait for Julius Tube. Set off a few fireworks while you wait for Julius Tube. \nYou set off a few fireworks to pass the time. The fireworks explode into the shape of the Canadian flag, which causes the U.S. military to send several dozen fighter jets to go shoot it with missiles. Keep waiting. \nAfter several hours, Julius Tube arrives. He looks at you with cold eyes. “Well, it seems I have an uninvited guest,” says Julius Tube in a stony, joyless voice. “I’m afraid I don’t have much patience for uninvited guests. Why don’t you get out of here, pal?” Why don't you hand over that tooth you stole from the Smithsonian museum, Mr. Tube? My name's Sam Stonemarrow, Mr. Tube. I'm here to retrieve a stolen dental artifact that once occupied the mouth of Abraham Lincoln. \nJulius Tube begins to laugh. His laugh is like a pornographic movie directed by a monkey: loud and unenjoyable, but presumably interesting to scientists. “You have a lot of nerve coming in here and making demands like that, detective,” he says to you. “Get out of my office before I make you sorry.” And what if I don't want to leave, Mr. Tube? What if I want to stick around until you give me that tooth? Reach into your gun pouch and pull out your revolver. \n“Well, in that case, I might know a few people who can persuade you to see things my way,” says Julius Tube. He snaps his fingers, and three stern-looking men enter the office. “Allow me to introduce the Murder Twins,” says Julius Tube, pointing at the three men. “Their names are Assassin 1, Assassin 2, and Assassin 2A. They’re the product of a secret government experiment by the CIA to produce a race of ruthless super-soldiers capable of killing a squirrel that got loose in the Pentagon during World War II. They’ve been bred to kill, and killing is the only thing they like.” The Murder Twins crack their knuckles and start walking toward you. The look in their eyes is not a kind one. Do me a favor, fellas. If you're going to kill me, will you at least stuff my eyeballs into my stomach so that I can see the inside of my own body before I die? Now let's be civil about this, fellas. Before you kill me, will you let me smoke one last cigarette? \n“Okay, but make it fast,” says Assassin 1. \n“Yeah, Assassin 2A needs to go to the bathroom,” says Assassin 2. Reach into your pocket and light up a cigarette. How do you know that your brother has to go to the bathroom? \n“One of the downsides of the genetic experiments that created us is that we don’t know when we have to go to the bathroom, but we know when our brothers have to go to the bathroom, so we all have to tell each other when we have to go to the bathroom,” explains Assassin 2A. Nod and light up your cigarette. \nWith hands steady enough to perform pig surgery, you reach into your pocket, pull out a cigarette, and set it on fire. The sweet plumes of fumes make your brain larger and allow you to think better. All of a sudden, you have a plan. Hey fellas, you might be able to kill me faster if there were more than just three of you. \n“He’s right,” says Assassin 2A. “We need to kill him as quickly as possible. You both have to go to the bathroom.” \n“Thank you for telling me that,” says Assassin 1. Maybe Juan Problemo could help you kill me. \n“Good idea,” says Assassin 2. “Hey, Juan Problemo!” \n“Yes?” says Juan Problemo without looking up from his typewriter. \n“Will you help us kill this detective?” Hold your breath and watch what happens. Yawn and watch what happens. \n“Huge mistake, motherfuckers,” says Juan Problemo. He stands up and sends the typewriter crashing to the ground. He throws off his assistant’s hat and puts on his detective’s hat, and suddenly you realize who he really is. \n“Oh shit!” yells Assassin 1. “Juan Problemo was actually John Problem: The Detective Who Kills People Who Ask Him For Help!” \n“Sayonara, you needy idiots,” says John Problem. He pulls out his enormous gun and shoots all three of the Murder Twins right in their breadbaskets. \n“My breadbasket!” screams Assassin 2A as he clutches his breadbasket and dies. \n“I hate you, John Problem!” screams Assassin 2 as the contents of his breadbasket spill all over the floor. He dies with fury in his eyes. \nAll three of the Murder Twins die from getting shot in the breadbasket. It's a good thing you were here, John Problem. John Problem, I've got to be the first person in the history of the world who's ever been happy to see you and your shit-ass business model. \n“I do what I can,” says John Problem. Well, goodbye. Now why don't you help me take care of Julius Tube? \n“Goodbye,” says John Problem. He leaves the office. \n“I don’t understand,” says Julius Tube. “How did you know that Juan Problemo was actually John Problem?” It's actually quite simple. I realized that Juan Problemo was Spanish for Jean Problème, which is French…for JOHN PROBLEM. I didn't know he was John Problem. I just thought he would help those guys kill me faster. \n“Well, that’s impressive detective work, but either way I’m afraid you’re too late,” says Julius Tube. “We have big plans for that tooth, and they’re already underway. We’ve found a wealthy buyer who collects things that have been in Abraham Lincoln’s mouth, and this tooth is going to become one of his most prized items. He’s willing to pay a king’s ransom for it. We’re going to sell it to him tomorrow, and there’s nothing you can do about it.” What do you mean \"we\"? \n“Well, then I suppose you got exceedingly lucky,” says Julius Tube. “But I’m afraid your luck ends here. You see, you’re too late to get the tooth. The plans to sell it are already underway. We’ve found a wealthy buyer who collects things that have been in Abraham Lincoln’s mouth, and this tooth is going to become one of his most prized items. He’s willing to pay a king’s ransom for it. We’re going to sell it to him tomorrow, and there’s nothing you can do about it.” What do you mean \"we\"? \nThe gunshot rings out before Julius Tube has a chance to answer you. The bullet lodges itself right in his Essential Lemon. It’s a fatal wound. “I…have been betrayed…” says Julius Tube. It doesn’t take him long to fall, and when he hits the ground, he hits it forever. \nSomehow you know who you’ll find standing behind you holding the pistol, but why not be scientific about it? Why not turn around and prove it for sure. Turn around. Look behind you by bending over and looking through your legs. \n“Hey there, Sam,” says Eileen Osiris. She gives you a kind-looking smile as she points her gun right at your Essential Lemon. Hello, Eileen. Oh, well, this is absolutely a fine shake of the whippet. This is the finest shake of the whippet I've ever seen. \n“Hey there, Sam,” says Eileen Osiris. She gives you a kind-looking smile as she points her gun right at your Essential Lemon. Hello, Eileen. Oh, well, this is absolutely a fine shake of the whippet. This is the finest shake of the whippet I've ever seen. \n“Are you surprised to see me?” Yes. No. Yes, but that's not saying much. I am always surprised by everything. Even things I already know. Every morning I read the encyclopedia entry for \"bugs,\" and I scream with shock and horror every time. \n“Well, let me explain a few things.” No need to explain. I know the whole story. You're the mysterious co-owner of the Grand Matador Theater, and you conspired with Julius Tube to steal the tooth from the Smithsonian. And then you killed him to keep all the profits for yourself. You sent me to look for the tooth so you'd have someone close by to pin the murder on! \n“You’re close, Sam, but you don’t know the whole story. Yes, I co-own the theater, and yes, I conspired with Julius to steal the tooth. But I never intended to sell it. I had for more ambitious plans.” What do you mean \"more ambitious\"? Stay silent and stare at Eileen in a way that lets her know you don't like that she is pointing her gun at your Essential Lemon. And you killed Dusty Washcloth, too! How could you do that to sweet Dusty Washcloth? \n“Yes, I’m afraid I did,” says Eileen Osiris. “I never meant for poor Dusty to get caught up in all this, but when the tooth went missing, he said that he was bound by the security guard’s code of honor to start running around screaming and asking everyone he saw if they were a detective. I had to kill him. I couldn’t let him jeopardize my plan.” And what exactly is your plan, Eileen? \n“Do you know what Ford’s Theatre is?” asks Eileen. Everyone knows that it's the theater where Abraham Lincoln got shot in the head. Everyone knows it's the theater where John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln in the head in an attempt to make it onto \"America's Funniest Home Videos.\" \n“Exactly,” says Eileen Osiris. “Everyone knows about Ford’s Theatre. It was just a normal, forgettable theater until Abraham Lincoln got assassinated there, and it suddenly became a world-famous tourist attraction. People have been coming from all over the world to see it for over 100 years.” What's your point, Eileen? \n“My point, Sam, is that with Abraham Lincoln’s tooth, I have his genetic material, so I can clone him. When Lincoln was assassinated once in Ford’s Theatre, it became a cash cow, but I’m going to use this tooth to clone Abraham Lincoln over and over again and assassinate him right here in my movie theater every single day . Sometimes I’ll assassinate him several times during a single movie. I’ll fill an entire room with 200 screaming Abraham Lincolns and then blow up the whole room with dynamite! Think of how famous my theater will be as the historic site of thousands of daily Lincoln assassinations! Julius wanted to sell the tooth for a single lump sum, but with my plan, I’ll be profiting for the rest of my life!” That incredibly good idea will never work, Eileen! It's too evil! What if the Lincoln clones fall in love with each other and start having sex with each other in the lobby, Eileen? Won't that drive away customers? \n“It won’t drive away customers. People love romance. It’s entirely natural that several thousand of the Abraham Lincoln clones will fall in love with each other. There will be dozens of Abraham Lincolns having sex with identical copies of themselves all over the theater, and I’ll have to come through and kill them all with a flamethrower while they have sex with each other. But people will think, ‘It is just like Romeo And Juliet .’” Damn it. You're right. But Eileen, think this through! This incredibly good idea will never work! It's too evil! \n“I’m sorry Sam, but the plan is already working.” She smiles at you. “Sorry to offend your rustic sense of justice.” \nShe walks over to a pot of soil and plants Abraham Lincoln’s tooth in the earth. No! Think about what you're doing! Нет! Подумайте о том, что вы делаете! \nEileen is right. She’s putting her evil plan in action, and you’re powerless to stop it. The soil in the pot stir,s and a perfect clone of Abraham Lincoln blooms out of it. \n“I ate my wife in Heaven,” says Abraham Lincoln. \n“Yes! It worked!” cried Eileen Osiris. “You see, Sam? My plan worked!” Nod sadly. Yeah, Eileen…it worked. \nAbraham Lincoln looks at you. “When I got to Heaven, I hid behind a bush for many years to wait for my wife to die. Then when my wife arrived in Heaven, I jumped out from behind the bush and ate her.” That's nice, Mr. President. I don't want to hear about that, Mr. President. \n“My wife tasted like soap! After I ate her, I went up to God and said, ‘Bad news, God, I ate my wife,’ and God said, ‘The only rule in Heaven is never bother God with your inane bullshit,’ and then he walked away.” Cool. Sounds good. \n“Well, I’d love to stay and chat, Sam, but I’ve got to go to the police and tell them that you’ve murdered Julius. I’m really sorry to have to frame you like this. Really. But…well, it’s all part of the plan.” She starts to walk out of the room, but before she can leave, Abraham Lincoln grabs her by the arm. Actually, Eileen, it looks like you might have gotten more than you bargained for. \n“What are you doing?” Eileen yells at the Lincoln clone. “What is the meaning of this!” \n“You’re under arrest,” says Abraham Lincoln. He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket and puts them around Eileen’s wrists. Don't you see, Eileen? You don't need to go get the police. The police are already here. You just resurrected the highest-ranking police officer in the country: the President of the United States! And I'm afraid he just heard you confess to murder. \n“I am going to take you to jail, and then you and I are going to be roommates in jail,” says the Lincoln clone. “I didn’t commit any crimes, but I need to be in jail. I will die if I do not go to jail.” \n“Sam, any chance you could get me out of this jam, for old times’ sake?” Eileen asks. Say nothing. Sorry, Eileen. The president is the chief of police. It's in the Constitution. There's nothing I can do. \nEileen smiles sadly. “Well, I guess I’ll see you around then, Sam.” Abraham Lincoln leads her out of the room to take her to jail. “John Wilkes Booth was also in Heaven, and he taught me how to ride a motorcycle,” says Abraham Lincoln as he leaves. \nAnd then Abraham Lincoln and Eileen Osiris are gone, leaving you alone once again. Walk back to your office. \nYou step out of the Grand Matador Theater and into the empty night. You solved the whole case, but you still feel like you didn’t figure a single goddamn thing out. You take a meandering route back toward your office to avoid the view. As you walk, you think about the old detective saying “Sometimes people are nice to you just so they can clone the president and kill him 1 million times at the movies.” Damn if it isn’t true. Keep walking. \nYou look up and see Big Excuse Me’s counterfeit moon rising into the sky alongside the real McCoy. Dozens of space shuttles swarm it as astronauts pay exorbitant fees for an opportunity to visit what they think is the real moon. After a few blocks you lose track of which one is the criminal moon and which one is real. Both are attracting astronauts, and both cast shadows across the city with their pale and heatless glow. \nThe End", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:20:05.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
