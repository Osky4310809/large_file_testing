Reddit user Gmadjar ended our 2017 Oscars respite in an incredibly funny way, by photoshopping himself into all of the Best Picture nominee's posters.\nSEE ALSO: How 'Moonlight' made Oscars history\nGuy Madjar from Chicago, says he is an aspiring graphic designer and has been photoshopping himself or friends into movie posters for years.\n\"The positive response was so overwhelming and I saw how much it was brightening up people's day, and how much people thought I looked like Josh Gad, and I just knew I wanted to do more,\" Madjar said. \"I currently have my next poster set in the works with the theme being 'Movie Classics.' I'm going to work to make these look even more real and again hopefully add a new twist to classic images.\"\nImage: reddit: Gmadjar\nImage: REDDIT: GMADJAR\nImage: REDDIT: GMADJAR\nImage: REDDIT: GMADJAR\nImage: reddit: GMADJAR\nImage: REDDIT: GMADJAR\nEach poster is a refreshing lesson in subtlety, where he delightfully keeps himself in the background.
