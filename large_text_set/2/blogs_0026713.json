Blue Whale.\nTwo schoolgirls, aged 15 and 16, fell to their deaths from a 14-storey block of flats, another, aged 15, fell from a fifth floor flat, while a 14-year-old girl died after being hit by a

and passions, using their favourite language and culture,’ reported the newspaper.\n‘They know psychology well, they convince girls that they are ‘fat’, tell boys that they are ‘losers’ in this world. And that there is another world and they will be among the chosen.’\nTwins, 3, drown in washing machine after mother 'left them for six minutes' A report on Ren TV said that an internal report by the FSB secret service, once headed by Vladimir Putin, ‘indicated that the problem of provoking suicides among underage children via Internet is really serious’.\nLast year an alleged ringleader named as 21 year old Philipp Budeikin was detained, and he has been charged with organising eight groups between 2013 and 2016 which ‘promote suicide’.\nSome 15 teenagers committed suicide, and another five were rescued at the last moment, according to the case against him.\nChildren are told on such social media that ‘the best things in life start with the letter ‘S’ – semiya (family), Saturday, sex, suicide.’\nA song tells them: ‘We have left for the open space, we have nothing left in this world’.\nThe children are asked: ‘How many dull days like this are you going to drag yourself through?’\nA picture of an approaching train has a sign: ‘This world is not for us.’\nA photograph of teens on a roof is captioned: ‘We are children of the dead generation.’\nSamaritans For emotional support contact Samaritans on 116 123 or visit their website .\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:23:02.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
