Image copyright Stanford University \nOne of the researchers, Dr Andre Esteva, told the BBC News website: \"We find, in general, that we are on par with board-certified dermatologists.\" \nHowever, the computer software cannot make a full diagnosis, as this is normally confirmed with a tissue biopsy. \nDr Esteva said the system now needed to be tested alongside doctors in the clinic. \n\"The application of AI to healthcare is, we believe, an incredibly exciting area of research that can be leveraged to achieve a great deal of societal good,\" he said. \n\"One particular route that we find exciting is the use of this algorithm on a mobile device, but to achieve this we would have to build an app and test its accuracy directly from a mobile device.\" \nIncredible advances in machine-learning have already led to AI beating one of humanity's best Go players . \nAnd a team of doctors in London have trained AI to predict when the heart will fail . \nDr Jana Witt, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: \"Using artificial intelligence to help diagnose skin cancer is very interesting, as it could support assessments by GPs and dermatologists. \n\"It's unlikely that AI will replace all of the other information your clinician would consider when making a diagnosis, but AI could help guide GP referrals to specialists in the future.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:15:43.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
