These images are apparently “based on accurate schematics”, but they don’t show us anything new or notably different. \nWell, the flash and heart rate sensors are on the camera module’s left this time around, and there seems to be no headphone jack at the bottom, keeping alive the doubts on Samsung’s final decision about the traditional audio port. From what one of our own sources tells us, the location of the speakers – at opposite ends of the phone – is correct. Do they feature Harman audio? No one knows for sure. \nBut with the Galaxy S8 expected to be all-screen and (virtually) zero-bezel on the front, most of these concept images could be very close to the real deal. There is simply no way to confirm at this point in time, so keep taking these leaks with a pinch of salt. The latest renders are pasted below for your perusal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T16:17:11.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
