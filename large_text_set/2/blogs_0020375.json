I don’t think the good people of Stoke are now avidly watching Russian automated Twitter bots. Bot out Putin! \n“We are not Trump, we are not Clinton. The idea that Putin gives a flying rat’s a**e about Paul Nuttall winning in Stoke – I just don’t see it.” Paul Nuttall, right with Nigel Farage \nL abour did not comment following a request from the Telegraph. There is no suggestion that the Twitter accounts are linked to any political party. \nThe network was uncovered by Alex King, an independent researcher who tracks Russian propaganda on social media. \nMr King found patterns that suggested the accounts were part of a co-ordinated campaign rather than driven by individual users, according to a report by the BBC . \nSome of the accounts used stock pictures as profile images with similar hashtags and messages. \nOne Tweet attacked Mr Nuttall after he had to apologise for wrongly stating that he had “close friends” who died in the Hillsborough football tragedy in 1989. — MORNING NEWS (eu) (@thomasicschenk1) February 20, 2017 \nA nother account posted a message saying “Ukip support just 12% nationally”, adding the hashtags #stokebyelection #StokeCentral #Copelandbyelection #Stoke #jeremycorbyn #labour4stoke #labour4copeland.” — Bembé Sunshine (@Spectral_News) February 20, 2017 \nT he news emerged after Mr Nuttall gave a witness statement to the criminal investigation into the Hillsborough disaster. \nMr Nuttall had faced a fierce backlash and calls to resign as an MEP after it emerged claims on his website that he lost close personal friends at Hillsborough were false. \nDuring a radio hustings with other candidates, the party leader insisted he had apologised to the \"people that matter\". \nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Breakfast he spent \"three hours” on Monday morning “giving a witness statement” to police. \nIn the same hustings Gareth Snell, Labour's candidate in the by-election, apologised to his wife, daughter and Grandmother for describing high-profile women as \"squabbling sour-faced ladies\" and \"polished t**ds\". Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (left) and candidate Gareth Snell Credit: Joe Giddins/Joe Giddins \nI n unguarded comments on Twitter from several years ago, Mr Snell called panellists on ITV’s Loose Women “squabbling sour-faced ladies”, described Janet Street-Porter as a “polished t**d” and said a “speccy blonde girl” on BBC’s The Apprentice series should “p**s off”. \nAfter Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, appeared on BBC’s Question Time, Mr Snell also tweeted: “Diane, you are great, then you say something incredibly a**ingly stupid.” \nMr Snell struck a more conciliatory tone at the hustings, saying: “I’ll take the opportunity to apologise again for the things that I said previously. \n\"I have apologised to my wife and my grandmother and my daughter because those aren’t words I would like them to have to face. So if I can take the opportunity to apologise, I will do.\" \nMr Snell also said he was sorry for the \"fruity\" language he used in a Tweet describing Brexit as \"a massive pile of s**t\".
