We hope you’ll give Slack a try.Stop by and learn more at: https://slack.com/ Slack Technologies, Inc. Web Site Slack Support   2.4.1 \n• We discovered that removing a bunch of unnecessary processes improved app startup time. Who knew? Less really is more. Or at least, less is more-faster. Or should that be fewer? Whatever: It's better.• We simplified the way we remember your teams and app settings. This shouldn't affect much, aside from some bugs wherein we forgot your teams or app settings, which are now fixed.• For the savvy troubleshooter, a new tool: Help > Show Logs in Explorer will package up some app diagnostic files, should you ever need them.• You'll now receive an OS notification when you join or leave the beta program. Our apologies to the folks previously confounded by an perplexingly inoperable \"Join the beta\" button.• Our zoom levels now match the Chrome browser, so you should feel right at home (so long as your home is Chrome).• An infrequent crash when quitting the app has been dispatched.• A slightly more frequent crash while checking for updates; eliminated.• Signing out of teams from the right-click menu is 46.8% more reliable.• And finally, if you had multiple displays, new windows (such as a call or a Post) would appear on the primary display instead of the display that Slack was on. Rather than submit this to a physics journal for peer review, we decided to fix it. All is as it should be. Screenshots Pretty useful with one major flaw.. by donothitken No hyperlinks to a local server.I freelance in an industry that creates a lot of media. We constantly need to send each other links to movies, audio, and illustrations on a shared local server.With Slack I can send the file, but not a link. This makes it a lot harder to locate shared recourses.Of course I can tell them what folder its in and they can navigate there in the finder, but on large jobs with complicated folder structures, its a huge pain.Slack is awesome, these people are smart, but as long as I need to use Messages to send hyperlinks, thats what I will use for comunication with the team. Now terrible for multi-lingual communications :-( by John in Paris I like most things about Slack, but I hate the regression in the most recent versions! Changes to how spellchecking is done now mean that only my system language is spellchecked. Which is a pain when I spend more than half my time in Slack writing in another language. And on top of that, force-touch look up of words has now been deactivated.The first problem is a major blocker for me, the second is an exceptional lack of polish in an otherwise decent app.It’s been over two months since the change that created this bug and despite assurances that developers were working on a solution, it’s still as present as ever. A major flaw in a communications tool which makes it much harder to communicate. :-( Best Patch Notes Ever by Captn Rio Apart from having the best patch notes of any program/game i’ve ever used, this App is great.Never had any issues with it. It keeps my Inbox clean with the much quicker response times. And it saves me from having to run down the hall to ask a co-worker a quick question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T14:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:42:18.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
