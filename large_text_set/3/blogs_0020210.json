Ali Ndume (APC-Borno). \nIn the motion, Ndume said that the alleged seizure of car belonging to Saraki had made the senate a subject of public ridicule. \nHe, therefore, urged the upper chamber to investigate the matter. \nThe committee was given four weeks to submit its report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:57:00.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
