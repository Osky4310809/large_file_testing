Livermore has made 25 appearances for Hull in all competitions this season West Brom have made a bid of about £10m for Hull's Jake Livermore after missing out on Morgan Schneiderlin. \nBaggies head coach Tony Pulis is desperate to strengthen his squad this month to build on an encouraging first part of the Premier League season. \nHe failed to land Schneiderlin, who has joined Everton from Manchester United, and also missed out on Leicester's Jeff Schlupp, now at Crystal Palace. \nMidfielder Livermore, 27, joined Hull in an £8m deal from Tottenham in 2014. \nPulis is a long-time admirer of Livermore and tried to sign him when he was Palace manager. \nHe is understood to be encouraged that Livermore only made the bench for Hull's victory over Bournemouth on Saturday.
