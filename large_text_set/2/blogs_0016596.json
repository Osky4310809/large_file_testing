File photo \n  The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) will adopt a new method to combat illegal drugs in communities with the use of stickers to identify drug-free homes. \nDILG Secretary Ismael Sueno said members of peace and order councils, which include the Philippine National Police (PNP) and practically all sectors of society in the barangay, would be tapped to conduct the anti-illegal drug campaign. \nThe councils would look into all the households in their locality to determine which are drug-free and post stickers on each house. This way the council members will know which households they still have to work on to get them drug-free. \nLast month, President Duterte stripped removed from the PNP and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) the responsibility of conducting anti-illegal drug operations amid the controversy over the death of Korean Jee Ick-joo, who was killed inside a vehicle parked inside Camp Crame, Quezon City. \nWitnesses have linked policemen and NBI agents to the crime. \nInvestigators said the police-suspects were hired to kill Jee but suspects later demanded ransom of P5 million from his wife.   \nThere were reports that some policemen were using the anti-drug Oplan Tokhang in extortion scams by threatening to link their victims to the illegal drug trade if they will not give them money. \nSueno said the DILG is also coordinating with governors and mayors and other local government officials for the project. ‘Drug resistant’ \nMeanwhile, Sen. Vicente Sotto III hopes citizens would resist illegal drugs and create a “drug-resistant” Philippines. \nSotto attended a meeting on the anti-illegal drug campaign with Pampanga mayors, chiefs of police and 505 barangay chairmen held at Kingsborough International Convention Center in San Fernando over the weekend. \n“The day we stop buying is the day they stop selling. If there is no one to use drugs, there will be no one to sell. Thus, I wish for a drug resistant Pampanga,” Sotto said. \nHe also lauded the efforts of Gov. Lilia Pineda and other Pampanga officials in promoting awareness against illegal drugs. \nEarlier, Pineda tapped the 5,050 barangay officials, bantay bayan members, barangay health workers and community workers to help in the province’s fight against illegal drugs in their respective communities. – With Ric Sapnu  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:23:32.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
