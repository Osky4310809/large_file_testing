About 3.3 million people . \nThe March was to serve as a political demonstration against Trump’s misogynistic, xenophobic and homophobic policies. These protests were also the largest political demonstration in the US since the Vietnam War.

This is why political stands are so important. Giphy \nHaidt explains that by taking part in a cause or organization that benefits others, your need to be a part of something bigger is realized. \nHistorically, “any volunteer work can take you out of yourself. But one that has history, traditions and rituals is an easier place to find ‘vital engagement,'” he says, referring to the term he uses to define the important relationship a person has with his or her surroundings. \nSo, if you got out your pussy hat this weekend and made your voice heard, you’re in for a happier life than the people who didn’t. \nCoincidence? I think not.
