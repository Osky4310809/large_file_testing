Britain MUST pay BILLIONS in EU exit fees, warns Irish PM Enda Kenny BRITAIN will need to pay up when it leaves the European Union, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny warned today. PUBLISHED: 16:35,  44, Thu, Mar 9, 2017 EPA Ireland's PM Enda Kenny has put pressure on Theresa May to pay EU contributions \nSpeaking at the EU Summit in Brussels, he said the UK had signed a “contract” of contributions to Brussels and would need to stay true to it despite last June's Leave vote. \nThe under-fire politician, who recently survived a vote of no confidence in the Irish parliament but it expected to step down in the near future, said while the exact amount was still to be determined it must be paid. \nThe Taoiseach warned: “When you sign on for a contract you commit yourself to participation. \n\"That, no more than any other problem, will have to be faced, it will have to be dealt with and it will be dealt with.

GETTY Theresa May is facing a Brexit roasting in Brussels this morning \nHe said: “That realisation is now growing in Ireland. Both public and elite opinion is likely to move in the direction of Irexit over the coming two years, and UK policy-makers should do all they can to encourage it. \n“Economically and psychologically, Ireland is closer to Boston than Berlin, and to Britain than Germany.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T19:02:42.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
