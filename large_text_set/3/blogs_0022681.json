To see for yourself, all you’ve got to do is walk by when the fence is open and inside you’ll witness a patio transformation come to life, with April Bloomfield’s future restaurant beyond getting a major overhaul as well. Now Eater has some even stronger details on what’s the come with the unnamed restaurant taking over, thanks to restaurateur Ken Friedman himself.\nFriedman spoke on Eater’s most recent Upsell podcast about his time in the music industry, his explosion into the New York City restaurant scene, and touched on what’s to come at Cat & Fiddle. Here’s what the often-reserved man had to say, in his own words:\nHow the deal went down “The Cat & Fiddle space became available, the landlord approached us. He asked us if we would do a British pub. I don't think either April or I wanted to just do a British pub at this point ... So, we said, \"Look, we'll do something there, but we'll do whatever we want to do. We don’t want a landlord to tell us what to do there.” And they said okay.”\n“It was this enchanted garden with a fountain” Remembering the history “So this space has a great courtyard, an amazing courtyard that when you look at old pictures of it from when it was built in 1927, it was this enchanted garden with a fountain. And over the years — it was a tea house for years, then it was a Polynesian restaurant for years — the garden was used. But then I think with the Cat & Fiddle — they used it, people sat out there — but it didn’t seem to have beautiful, indigenous plants, and there weren’t avocado trees, and lime trees, and lemon trees, and herbs. It didn’t smell like a beautiful Southern California place.”\nJolie Ruben Ken Friedman And what’s to come “Our intention is to make an enchanted garden in the front of what was the Cat & Fiddle, and then also have the indoors, which now that we've gutted it, is light and airy, and it's not a dark kind of British pub-looking place, anyway. It's wood and it's stucco and it's light.”\nHow about cuisine details? “I think at this point April doesn't want to do just British cuisine only. So we're going to do something awesome there. We're not exactly sure what it is. She has a pretty clear idea of what she's doing with the food.”\nJust don’t ask for a timeline yet “It's going to go way over budget. and, it's not going to open when we say, so I won't even say, because it will never open when we think.”\nTo listen to the entire Ken Friedman Upsell episode, you can head right to iTunes or find the transcript of the conversation online as well. Otherwise, hold tight for more Cat & Fiddle updates as they come.\nLegendary The Cat & Fiddle Is Saved With New Hollywood Location [ELA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:54:38.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
