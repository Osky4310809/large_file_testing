Wrong...\". \nHe continued: \"I thought and felt I would win big, easily over the fabled 270\" electoral votes. \nMr Trump's continued focus on his unexpected November 8 victory comes as he works behind closed doors to shape his new administration. He will be sworn into office in just 18 days. Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2016 \nIn another tweet on Monday, the president-elect complained about a cover photo used in a new book released by CNN. He wrote: \"Hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!\" \nMr Trump also sparked controversy with his New Year message, which said: \"Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!\" \nMeanwhile, Mr Trump has said Rahm Emanuel, Chicago's mayor and President Barack Obama's former chief of staff, should ask for federal assistance if he cannot bring down the city's rising homicide tally. \nThe nation's third largest city had 762 homicides in 2016 - the most in two decades and more than the largest cities New York and Los Angeles combined.
