As cries of “Smooth giraffes!” echoed across the NYSE floor, Gillette saw their value reach a record high after nine months of stagnant inactivity, blowing all first-quarter projections out of the water. \nAbout an hour later, the incredible run was briefly slowed by this tweet from the San Diego Zoo: \nBut the Gillette price began its climb back into the stratosphere when Warren Buffet—who had previously sold off his shares of Gillette stock back in 2014—bought back in for $10 million just before the closing bell, effectively endorsing the company president’s bold vision for shaved zoos and encouraging other investors to do the same. \nIf you’re a longtime Gillette stockholder, then congratulations! If you’re not, then you should probably buy some stock now, because when the Asian markets open tomorrow’s trading, the price is only going to climb from here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T04:50:23.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
