Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nCoronation Street viewers were reeling in shock after evil builder Pat Phelan appeared to brutally kill Andy Carver on Friday night. \nPhelan was seen smashing a laptop down on Andy’s head after he discovered that he had vital evidence proving that he was behind a dodgy flats scheme. \nAnd it looks like Pat can now be counted as one of Corrie’s most notorious killers. Pat Phelan has joined Coronation Street’s coldest killers \nWe look back on the most shocking Coronation Street murderers of all time… Read More Murderer Richard Hillman with a crowbar (Photo: Granada) \n1. Richard Hillman – played by Brian Capron \nBack in 2003, viewers were horrified as Gail McIntyre’s husband Richard Hillman bludgeoned poor Maxine Peacock to death in her own home. \nHillman had originally planned to kill elderly Emily Bishop while she was babysitting for Maxine and Ashley. \nBut when the bubbly hairdresser returned home early from her mum's birthday celebrations – Richard hit her several times with a crowbar. John Stape kidnapped Rosie Webster before going on a murder spree (Photo: ITV) \n2. John Stape – played by Graeme Hawley \nWhen lovable teacher John Stape first strolled onto the cobbles, it looked like factory worker Fiz Brown had finally found her perfect match. \nThat was, until, her ever increasingly odd boyfriend embarked on an affair with teenager Rosie Webster. \nSoon after, John completely lost the plot and ended up kidnapping Rosie and holding her hostage in his grandma's attic. \nLuckily, the creepy bloke was captured and chucked in jail. But on his (rather quick) release he then stole the identity of another man, Colin Fishwick, so he could go back to teaching English. \nBut things didn't quite go to plan and as John faced the prospect of being caught he ended up on a mini killing spree – leaving poor Fiz in the frame for all the unexplained deaths. But as Fiz faced a life in prison a guilt-ridden John came clean to the cops. Tracy Barlow killed Charlie Stubbs after giving him a lap dance (Photo: PA) \n3. Tracy Barlow – played by Kate Ford \nIn shocking scenes in 2007, Tracy Barlow found out about her boyfriend Charlie Stubbs’ affair with Maria and she went after revenge. \nAfter performing a seductive lap dance for him in a leather mini skirt, she hit him around the head with a heavy statue ornament. \nTracy later claimed she’d killed him in self-defence and was sentenced to 15 years in prison for Charlie's murder. \nBut she returned to the cobbles in December 2010 after forensic evidence used at her trial was discredited. Katy Harris killed her dad Tommy (Photo: Granada TV) \n4. Katy Harris – played by Lucy-Jo Hudson \nKaty Harris was only a teen when she killed her dad Tommy in one of the Street's most sensational story lines ever. \nShe stabbed him to death after a huge row. \nHothead Tommy was furious when Katy revealed she was expecting older lover Martin Platt's baby. \nThe pair fought before the devastated schoolgirl, who deliberately got pregnant to trap Martin, knifed her dad. \nKaty later took her own life after she could no longer cope with the guilt of murdering her own father. \nShe drank water mixed with sugar, which was deadly because of her diabetes, and was found unconscious by Martin. She died shortly after her arrival at Weatherfield General. Tina McIntyre was murdered by Rob Donovan (Photo: ITV) \n5. Rob Donovan – Marc Baylis The Weatherfield businessman pushed the Rovers Return barmaid to her death as millions watched. \nDodgy Rob, engaged to Tracy Barlow, became enraged after Tina threatened to go to the police. Tina McIntyre, played by Michelle Keegan with Corrie killer Rob Donovan (Photo: ITV) \nTina plunged to the cobbles after being knocked over the edge of scaffolding on the builders' yard balcony. \n\"I will never keep my mouth shut, I will scream it from the rooftops,\" she hollered - before telling Rob that Tracy would have to visit him in prison.
