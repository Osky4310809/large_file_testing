Oguzhan Ozyakup v Robin van Persie \nOguzhan Ozyakup and Robin van Persie played together at Arsenal. Whilst the latter was a big star at the club, it is well known that RVP helped Ozyakup in north London as both come from Holland. \nOzyakup has spoken publicly about his admiration for van Persie and there are even reports that the latter convinced him to leave Arsenal for first team opportunities elsewhere. \nThis friendship visibly dissipated on the field during Fenerbahce’s 1-0 win at Besiktas. Van Persie celebrated the winner by sliding in front of Ozyakup. \nAfter the match Ozyakup said: “I was very good friends with a certain player. That changed today. Sometimes you see the real face of a footballer on the field.” Jelena Karleusa v Robin van Persie \nMeanwhile, off the pitch, there was another battle going on. \nOn 41 minutes, Dusko Tosic was sent off for a coming together with Robin van Persie. \nThere is absolutely no doubt that RVP dived when Tosic squared up to him. \nOn Twitter, Tosic’s wife Jelena Karleusa called out Robin van Persie with a Tweet that has since been deleted. \nSee all the madness from Besiktas 0 – Fenerbahce 1 below.
