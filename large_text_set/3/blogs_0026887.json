Labor is AGAINST removing the deficit levy, arguing that it‚Äôs essentially green lighting a tax cut for ‚Äúmillionaires‚Äù. View this image ‚Ä∫ \nSean Davey / AAPIMAGE But there‚Äôs been some confusion recently about whether someone on $180,000 a year should be considered ‚Äúrich‚Äù.\nID: 10773960 3. Last year Labor leader Bill Shorten was asked about it by Neil Mitchell on radio 3AW ‚Ä¶ MITCHELL: What level do you look at though, that‚Äôs why it comes down to what is rich? Is $180,000 a year rich?\nSHORTEN: No it‚Äôs not, but what I would say to you is that if you have $5 million in superannuation and retirement you probably don‚Äôt need the rest of the taxpayers stuck in the traffic this morning paying for you to get a tax concession.\nID: 10773974 4. In parliament on Monday Labor goaded prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who snapped at Shorten, calling his new position ‚Äúhypocrisy‚Äù. Would you call Australians on $180,000/year \"rich\"?\n‚Äî Mark Di Stefano ü§ôüèª (@MarkDiStef) ID: 10773985 5. Some people thought that an INDIVIDUAL would be rich on that amount money. But not a household. @MarkDiStef individuals or households? Individuals; absolutely. Households; no.\n‚Äî Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoRCC) ID: 10773995 6. Many thought the ‚Äúrich‚Äù definition would depend on where you‚Äôre pocketing that $180,000. @MarkDiStef If I lived in Camooweal, I'd be rich. If I lived in central Sydney and had three kids ...\n‚Äî Stavros (The Cat) (@alias_burgerboy) ID: 10774002 7. The average income in Australia is about $80,000 . But that is obviously skewed by the mega millionaires raking in the cash. @MarkDiStef Yes, but I would also not be surprised to learn they had no money spare each pay cycle\n‚Äî Anna Spargo-Ryan (@annaspargoryan) ID: 10773997 8. Last time this question came up The Guardian ‚Äôs economics guru Greg Jericho crunched some numbers and found the MEDIAN taxable income for a single person is about $50,000 per year. @MarkDiStef well off, yes. Not rich.\n‚Äî shan (@shanbennet) ID: 10774004 9. We can all agree that $180,000 is a lot more than someone on welfare benefits receives. @MarkDiStef @NannanBay If you're on $13,000 Newstart, well then $180,000 is unbelievably rich.\n‚Äî Lucy Donoghue (@lucymdonoghue) ID: 10774003 10. And many people suggested the ‚Äúrich‚Äù part of the equation really depends on how much people SPEND. @MarkDiStef Income + Wealth are related, but not synonymous. Someone earning $180Kpa may have saved a million or pissed it away. Ditto $80K.\n‚Äî Jacob Aldridge (@jacobaldridge) ID: 10774005 11. Yes, ‚Äúlifestyle choices‚Äù are a factor. @MarkDiStef If your family brings in $180k you are doing well. If u are still broke then u need 2 look at your lifestyle choices.\n‚Äî Short Round (@john_c0nner) ID: 10774007 So we'd like to know: Would you call a fellow Australian on $180,000 per year \"rich\"?
