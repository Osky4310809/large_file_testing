According to E! News , the incident occurred in Hollywood at around 7:30 p.m.\nLocal police confirmed that Teigen was in the car that was hit, and that an unnamed person was later arrested on a misdemeanor charge for bailing on the scene. We’re SO glad to hear that Teigen was not injured and that the person responsible has been caught. Because car accidents can be incredibly scary and stressful no matter who you are, and it never helps when the person who, you know, hit your vehicle and endangered your safety doesn’t stick around to exchange information (let alone just stop to make sure you’re okay).\nA photo posted by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Jan 4, 2017 at 2:22pm PST \nWe’re also glad that it doesn’t look like Teigen will be slowing down any time soon. It was recently revealed that she’ll be accompanying husband John Legend on his “Darkness and Light” tour (with adorable baby Luna in tow as well of course). She also hopped back on the modeling horse recently by appearing in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition . Basically, she’s been pretty freaking busy, and we’re hoping this frustrating snafu won’t throw a wrench in her plans.\nA photo posted by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Jan 14, 2017 at 8:31pm PST \nSending all our good vibes Teigen’s way today and hoping that the rest of the week goes better for her. Because again, car accidents — even when you walk away okay — are the WORST and no one needs that extra stress in their lives.\nSending a hug your way, Chrissy (or a high five, or a cool secret hand shake…whatever will make you feel better).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:03:52.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
