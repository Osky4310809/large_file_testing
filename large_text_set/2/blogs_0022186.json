The phone went on sale in China last month where it racked up over a million registrations for the first sale, and now HMD Global has announced an international variant of the Nokia 6 which will go on sale in several markets, including India. Nokia 6 1 of 7 The Nokia 6 is a mid-range smartphone, but interestingly, it’s currently the most premium device in Nokia’s Android lineup. That said, the finish is quite luxurious, constructed entirely out of aluminium. The phone also comes in a limited edition, glossy Arte Black finish, which reminds us a lot of the Jet Black iPhone 7. The phone sports a 5.5-inch full HD display with 2.5D contoured Gorilla Glass protection. In the front, you’ll find a physical home button which also integrates a fingerprint sensor, flanked by backlit Android navigation keys. It’s quite slim, measuring just 8mm around the waist. The port and button placement are standard, although the use of micro-USB instead of USB Type C might be disappointing to some. The Nokia 6 comes in both single and dual-SIM variants, with the latter featuring hybrid slots to allow storage expansion up to 128GB. The phone features a 16MP rear camera with PDAF, f/2.0 aperture and dual-tone flash. At the front, there’s an 8MP snapper with autofocus, which is a rarity for smartphones even today. The selfie camera also features a wide-angle 84-degree lens, in case you want to capture group shots. Powering the Nokia 6 is the budget Snapdragon 430 processor, which is a bit of a let down. We wish Nokia had opted for at least a Snapdragon 625 SoC. Working in tandem, you get 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (4GB + 64GB for the Arte Black edition). The battery on board is a 3,000mAh unit. One of the great features about the Nokia 6 is that it runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat, with the promise of timely updates in the future. The phone features a vanilla Android interface, and comes with the Google Assistant baked in. The connectivity options include LTE support and built-in NFC. The Nokia 6 is priced at €229 (~Rs 16,117) for the regular variant, and €299 (~Rs 21,043) for the Arte Black edition. It will go on sale globally in Q2 this year. It’s clear that Nokia isn’t interested in the specs and price war with its Android phones, and instead is focussed on usability, reliability and build quality, the key pillars of its success in the past. That said, if HMD Global prices the Nokia 6 well in India, it could emerge as a favourite contender in the mid-range. We’ll just have to wait and watch.
