The thimble was an icon, but back in February a bunch of internet monsters decided its time had come , apparently. Agree to disagree.\nInstead, Hasbro announced today, the game will offer up eight new tokens: the Scottie dog, top hat, car, battleship, cat, T-rex, rubber ducky and penguin tokens. I mean, is a rubber ducky even a rubber ducky if it's not rubber?? Will these new tokens not fundamentally warp children's understanding of inanimate objects?? Am I taking this too personally?? No one will ever know the answers to these pressing questions.\nAnd there you have it, 4.3 million wrong people voted against the thimble. At least we have a cat and a T-rex now.\nWATCH: Which 'Monopoly' Token Will Go to Jail?", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/akk2G0deNxumWshiYxMfQneTgdo=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F416930%2Facd4ee03-7808-4de3-a4c2-57ef34c61410.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ukEwFM-E2VVi5n4pyQ19vK3RizQ=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F416930%2Facd4ee03-7808-4de3-a4c2-57ef34c61410.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Z7sNBrR5.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Z7sNBrR5.m3u8"], "published": "2017-03-17T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T16:03:42.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
