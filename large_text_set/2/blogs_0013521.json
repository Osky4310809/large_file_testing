We’ve seen quite a few smartphones boasting dual cameras lately, and while it started off with premium phones, one can find this coveted feature even in more affordable devices now. Interestingly, not all dual-camera implementations on phones work in a similar fashion. In fact, brands like LG and Huawei have utilized multiple sensors to perform entirely different functions. So we at 91mobiles tried to decode the various dual camera setups found in the market. The result? We were greeted with some of the best dual camera smartphones you can pick for yourself. Without further ado, let’s get started. Honor 6X Huawei has reigned unchallenged in the flagship-killer and premium segment with its dual-camera offerings and the company now hopes to extend its legacy in the budget segment as well, with the Honor 6X . Sporting a pair of 12MP and 2MP sensors on the back, the Honor 6X is a great smartphone for photography and comes with dedicated modes like pro photo, pro video, night shot and HDR. Up front, the smartphone gets an 8MP sensor which shoots great selfies as well. Suffice it to say, Honor’s experience in smartphone photography is reflected on the 6X as well. Huawei P9 \nThe camera on the Huawei P9 is one of the USPs of the device. At the back, the Huawei P9 sports dual 12MP cameras which are certified by popular lens maker Leica. While one of the cameras features a full RGB sensor to capture color, the other is a monochrome sensor for greyscale imagery. The monochrome sensor can capture up to two times the light captured by the RGB sensor. When you snap a photo, both cameras fire simultaneously, and the resultant image is a combination of the two pictures. In theory, this methodology should result in more details and better contrast and depth. Moreover, the 5.2-inch full HD display of the P9 is perfect to enjoy all your captures. A more affordable alternative to the Huawei P9 comes from the company’s sub-brand Honor in the form of Honor 8 , which also sports dual 12MP rear cameras, out of which one is an RGB sensor and the other is a monochrome sensor. However, unlike the P9, it cannot capture monochrome images directly, but you can apply a filter to achieve the same effect. Apple iPhone 7 Plus \nThe 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus is host to two 12MP rear cameras as well. While the camera hump is much bigger now, the Cupertino giant has utilised the prowess of the dual cameras well. The first sensor gets a 28mm wide-angle lens that can capture more area in a single frame, while the other is a 56mm telephoto lens which you can use to get 2X optical zoom without reducing the quality of the image. Apple has also revealed that the phone will soon get a software update that will allow you to take beautiful portraits with an enhanced depth of field and bokeh effect. The new iPhones come with loads of new features, and here’s a look at the top seven. Coolpad Cool1 Dual The newest entrant in the list comes in the form of the Cool1 Dual , a product made jointly by LeEco and Coolpad. The affordable phone makes use of two 13MP shooters at the rear, which help in depth sensing and an overall enhanced realistic bokeh effect. Apart from this, the device also gets phase detection autofocus, dual tone LED flash, as well as the ability to shoot 4K videos. Despite being the most affordable in the list, the Cool 1 Dual is quite loaded. It comes with a 5.5-inch full HD display, a Snapdragon 652 SoC, 4GB of RAM and a beefy 4,000mAh battery to power the hardware. LG V20 / G5 LG’s successor to last year’s V10 , the V20 , is also a treat for shutterbugs. The V20 sports a 16MP camera with a 75-degree lens, and a secondary 8MP camera with a wide 135-degree lens at the rear. This means, that the V20 can enjoy a host of different shots, including some stunning wide angle captures. What’s more is that the V20 also gets a 120-degree wide-angle selfie camera with a resolution of 5MP. Interestingly, the V20 doesn’t only have dual cameras, but it also rocks dual screens, as there is a smaller secondary display on top of the regular canvas. Users can also look at the LG G5 , which costs less than the V20 and comes furnished with the exact same camera setup. What’s more is that the smartphone is semi-modular, and allows users to swap its battery as well as attach several modules to boost the smartphone’s performance in various aspects. Lenovo PHAB 2 Plus Lenovo recently brought its affordable PHAB 2 Plus smartphone to India. As the name suggests, the device is a phablet sporting a gigantic 6.4-inch full HD display. At the back, the smartphone features dual 13MP cameras with f/2.0 aperture and features like laser autofocus, phase detection autofocus and dual-LED flash. The augmented reality mode in the main camera lets you create photos and videos with superimposed effects like virtual backgrounds or cartoons. Selfie lovers won’t be disappointed as well with an 8MP front shooter for selfies and video calls. And if this wasn’t enough, the PHAB 2 Plus also comes with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Audio Capture 5.1 surround sound support to make for an immersive audio experience. These are some of the best smartphones that come with a dual-camera setup. With more and more manufacturers jumping on the bandwagon, we think that 2017 might be the year when dual cameras rule the smartphone arena. So if this does turn out to be true, you know where you read it first. Thank us later.
