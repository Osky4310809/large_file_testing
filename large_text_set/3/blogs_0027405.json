While both carriers have a great selection of phones, many folks claim AT&T’s selection is a bit broader. AT&T has everything from the best flagship devices to mid-range phones, all the way down to budget friendly options. So if you’re looking for the best AT&T phones, we’ve got you covered.\nBest AT&T prepaid phones\nBest Sprint Phones Best Verizon phones In the list below, we’ve also added a couple unlocked options at the bottom of the post if you’re interested in going off-contract. Without any further ado, let’s get started!\nEditor’s note – We will be updating this list as more devices hit the market. \nLG G6 \nSee more LG G6 photos \nThroughout 2016, the LG G5 struggled to take on the Galaxy S7, HTC 10 and all the other flagships released that year. It’s not a bad phone, per se, it just lacks the level of polish we normally expect from top-tier smartphones nowadays. The phone would have been more widely accepted if it nailed the modular implementation, but unfortunately the whole module-swapping process was wonky and the three “Friends” that launched with the G5 weren’t all that appealing. With the G6, LG has gone back to the basics.\nCertainly the most standout feature on the G6 is its 5.7-inch Quad HD LCD display, with its interesting aspect ratio of 18:9 and rounded corners . It also comes with a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4 GB of RAM, plenty of on-board storage, an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and dual 13 MP rear cameras. It’s worth noting that not all LG G6s are created equal . For example, the G6 that’s coming to the U.S. is the only variant that supports wireless charging, while the Hi-Fi Quad DAC is exclusive to South Korea and certain markets in Asia. What’s more, the G6 with 64 GB of storage is only available in a handful of markets.\nThis isn’t a phone that introduces a bunch of gimmicky features that you’ll never use. It’s simply a solid, well-built smartphone that nails the main areas users care most about.\nSpecs 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 2880 x 1440 resolution, 564 ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 4 GB of RAM 32/64 GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256 GB Dual 13 MP rear cameras, 5 MP front camera Non-removable 3,300 mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm, 163 g Read more LG G6 review: it flies… like a G6!

Design-wise, many would say those two phones were close to perfect. The company forwent a plastic design and instead included glass front and back panels with an aluminum frame. They weren’t without their flaws, though. The S6 and S6 Edge didn’t offer expandable storage or removable batteries — two features Samsung has been known to include in all its smartphones for years.\nNow the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have made their way to the masses, and they fix many of the problems the S6 line introduced last year. While they don’t offer removable batteries, Samsung included expandable storage on both handsets in case the 32 GB of on-board storage isn’t enough. Samsung mostly stuck to the same design this time around, though they did shrink down the camera bumps on the back and made the devices a little thicker to make room for larger batteries.\nIn terms of specs, these are top-of-the-line smartphones. They come with Quad HD Super AMOLED displays, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processors, 4 GB of RAM, great 12 MP rear-facing cameras and run the latest version of Android. Instead of featuring the same screen sizes this time around though, Samsung kept the S7 at a smaller 5.1 inches, while the S7 Edge has been bumped up to a larger 5.5-inch panel.\nSeriously, these are some incredible smartphones. They are a little pricey, but all in all, we think the high asking price is worth it.\nSpecs Samsung Galaxy S7 \n5.1-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 577 ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4 GB of RAM 32 GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200 GB 12 MP rear camera, 5 MP front camera Non-removable 3,000 mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm, 152 g Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge \n5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 534 ppi Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4 GB of RAM 32 GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 200 GB 12 MP rear camera, 5 MP front camera Non-removable 3,600 mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm, 157 g Read more Samsung Galaxy S7 review Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review Samsung Galaxy S7 unboxing and first 48 hours Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge unboxing and first 48 hours Samsung Galaxy S7 camera: feature focus Best Galaxy S7 cases Best Galaxy S7 Edge cases HTC 10 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 / Edge vs LG G5 Buy the Galaxy S7 from AT&T Buy the Galaxy S7 Edge from AT&T \nLG V20 \nSee more LG V20 photos \nThe V20 is basically the phone for power users. It has a a big Quad HD display, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor, plenty of RAM and on-board storage, dual 16 MP rear-facing cameras, and a removable 3,200 mAh battery. Of course, the unique Second Screen makes a return this year, along with the addition of Quad DAC, military standard durability, and it’s already running Android 7.0 Nougat.\nIf top-of-the-line specs and an impressive feature set is what you’re looking for, you can’t go wrong with the V20.\nSpecs 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 513 ppi Secondary display: 2.1-inch IPS LCD display with 160 x 1040 resolution, 513 ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4 GB of RAM 32/64 GB of on-board storage, microSD expansion up to 256 GB Dual 16 and 8 MP rear cameras, 5 MP front camera Removable 3,200 mAh battery Android 7.0 Nougat 159.7 x 78.1 x 7.6 mm, 174 g Read more LG V20 review LG V20 tips and tricks LG V20 drop test LG V20 Feature Focus: software LG V20 specs, price, release date and everything else you should know LG V20 vs LG V10 LG V20, G5, Note 7, S7 Edge: display showdown LG V20 vs Galaxy Note 7: camera comparison Buy now from AT&T Buy now from Amazon Samsung Galaxy S7 Active \nSee more Galaxy S7 Active photos \nYou’re constantly dropping your phone. You always use one of those indestructible phone cases. Your phone has taken a swim more than you have this summer.\nDoes this sound like you? If so, you should probably pick up the Galaxy S7 Active.\nIt has mostly all the same specifications as the standard Galaxy S7, but this one comes with a handful of improvements for those who need a more rugged device. It’s IP68 certified for dust proofing and water resistance, and also comes with a MIL-STD-810G certification for salt, dust, humidity, rain, vibration, solar radiation, transport and thermal shock resistance.

If you don’t mind buying your next smartphone through another retailer, you should absolutely go for Google’s new Pixel or Pixel XL. When you buy one of these phones through the Google Store, you’ll be able to activate it on AT&T’s network. Plus, if you don’t feel like spending $650+ outright, Google also has some decent financing options.\nGoogle Pixel and Pixel XL \nSee more Google Pixel and Pixel XL photos \nGoogle’s Pixel and Pixel XL are here, and they truly are some amazing smartphones. \nNot only are they the first phones to ship with the Google Assistant on board, they also come with plenty of exclusive software features and some of the best smartphone cameras in existence . \nUnder the hood, they sport some killer specs, too. Both devices have an AMOLED display, a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4 GB of RAM, plenty of on-board storage and long-lasting batteries. The overall design of these phones may not be the most unique, but they do feel like premium phones through and through. \nThere are a few things about these phones that will turn some people away, though. For starters, they only sport an IP53 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning they’re not nearly as waterproof as the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge. There are ways around that , but none that will make the devices truly waterproof. Plus, if you buy the Verizon model, you’ll have to deal with a small amount of bloatware (though you will be able to uninstall it), you won’t be able to unlock the bootloader , and Verizon will be handling all Pixel and Pixel XL software updates (though the company swears it won’t delay them ). \nIf you’re in the market for a new flagship Android phone and don’t mind spending over $650, you should buy the Pixel or Pixel XL… these are two of the best Android phones out there. \nSpecs Google Pixel \n5.0-inch AMOLED display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 441 ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 4 GB of RAM 32/128 GB of on-board storage, no microSD expansion 12.3 MP rear camera, 8 MP front camera Non-removable 2,770 mAh battery Android 7.1 Nougat 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.6 mm, 143 g Google Pixel XL \n5.5-inch AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution, 534 ppi Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 4 GB of RAM 32/128 GB of on-board storage, no microSD expansion 12.3 MP rear camera, 8 MP front camera Non-removable 3,450 mAh battery Android 7.1 Nougat 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6 mm, 168 g Read more Google Pixel XL review: A Pixel’s perspective Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on Google Pixel XL vs Nexus 6P first look Google Pixel and Pixel XL vs the competition Google Pixel and Pixel XL specs, price, release date and everything else you should know Buy now from the Google Store How did you like our list of the best AT&T phones?
