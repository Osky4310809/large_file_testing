It has been approved for the animals to be killed in their dens during hibernation and sleep. All forms of trapping and firearms are allowed. This is barbaric and inhumane. The extermination is going to happen for the sole purpose of increasing the moose and elk population. The moose and elk are not in danger of extinction. The senate wants to increase the population for hunters. There are plenty of hunting grounds in this country, especially Alaska. Killing off two species in order to be able to kill another species is ridiculous. Let Mother Nature do her thing. She's been doing it for millennia and will continue to do her thing without our intervention or help. We have enough animal species going extinct every year without adding to the problem. Your signature or lack thereof is the only hope these animals have. Please stop this bill or law dead in its tracks.
