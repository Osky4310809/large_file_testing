After intense backlash from politicians following the American Health Care Act, the GOP bill to repeal Obamacare, Ryan rolled up his sleeves and a TV monitor to give a powerpoint presentation on the deficiencies of the Affordable Care Act. \nThe criticism towards the new healthcare bill has come from both ends of the political spectrum — Democrats are worried millions will lose health insurance, while conservative Republicans fear it’s still too similar to Obamacare; medical professionals have also voiced serious objections ; the biggest denouncement came from the American Medical Association in a letter to Congress. It said: \nWhile we agree that there are problems with the ACA that must be addressed, we cannot support the AHCA as drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations. \nSince the bill’s rollout, Ryan, President Donald Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer have been working overtime to counteract all the negative feedback.
