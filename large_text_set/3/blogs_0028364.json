says Donald Trump 'didn't care or particularly know about healthcare' \nClaim comes after President admits 'we learned a lot about loyalty' in wake of repeal bill defeat  50   US Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any links to Moscow Getty \nPresident Donald Trump \"didn't care or particularly know about health care\" despite trying to push a major reform bill through Congress, a senior Republican aide has reportedly claimed. \nMr Trump and top House Republican Paul Ryan tasted defeat on Friday when they were forced to pull the bill, designed to replace Barack Obama's flagship Affordable Care Act, because they could not get enough votes within their own party to pass it. \nThe President blamed Democrats for failing to support the plan, but the self-professed dealmaker also said: \"We learned a lot about loyalty, we learned a lot about the vote-getting process.\" He insisted \"Obamacare will explode\" eventually and that opposition politicians would see the light and work with him on a new plan. \nVice President Mike Pence and budget director Mick Mulvaney joined Mr Trump in aggressive lobbying for votes with members of the dissenting Republican Freedom Caucus faction, and the President had also tried to court moderates.

If you are going to be a great negotiator, you have to know about the subject matter.\" \nCNN also reported that during a meeting with moderate Republicans, when Pennsylvania congressman Charlie Dent said he did not support the repeal-and-replace bill, Mr Trump said: \"Why am I even talking to you?\" \nIn his meeting with the Freedom Caucus the President reportedly urged sceptical legislators to ignore the \"little s***\" of the policy detail and give him the support he needed. \nAmong the group's objections was the \"essential health benefits\" clause of the bill. \nIt said that requiring insurance companies to cover a list of items—including, but not limited to, access to mental health services, substance abuse counselling, physical therapy, maternal care and paediatric care like vaccinations—would raise premiums.
