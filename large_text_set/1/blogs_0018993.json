'An insult to women' \nHowever, a statement from the French Academy of Cinema Arts and Techniques, which runs the Cesars, praised the director. \n\"Artist, filmmaker, producer, writer, actor, director, there are many words to define Roman Polanski but only one to express our admiration and enchantment: thank you, Mr President,\" said the organisation's head, Alain Terzian, according to French newspaper Le Monde. \nMr Polanski, best known for the films Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby and The Pianist, has French and Polish citizenship. \nIn December, Poland's Supreme Court rejected a request by the nation's justice minister to have Mr Polanski extradited to the US to face the charges. \nHis victim, Samantha Geimer, described the ordeal of giving testimony against Polanski, in an interview for the BBC's Hardtalk programme in 2013. Media caption Samantha Geimer: Consequences of rape were awful \nThe 42nd Cesars ceremony will take place in Paris on 24 February. \nAn online petition calling for him to be removed from the jury role had gathered just under 50,000 signatures on Friday. \n\"It is an insult to women and the suffering they can endure, an insult to victims of rape,\" it read.
