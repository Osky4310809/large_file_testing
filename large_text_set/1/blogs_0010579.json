In order to gear up for the show that will hopefully fill the void that The Crown left in your heart , here is what you need to know about Victoria and Albert’s timeless romance and subsequent relationship. Full warning: Spoilers, no doubt, lie ahead! Expand Jenna Coleman as Victoria and Tom Hughes as Prince Albert in Masterpiece Theatre’s Victoria.

(Victoria’s mother, Victoire, Duchess of Kent, was the sister of Albert’s father, Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.) However, marrying one’s cousin was not uncommon during the 19th century, especially within one’s social class. Victoria and Albert were born within three months of each other—and were delivered by the same midwife. But They Didn’t Meet Until They Were Older—And at First Victoria Wasn’t Interested Victoria met Albert and his brother Ernest when they came to pay her a visit before she was queen. (Albert was German and grew up in the duchy of Saxe-Coburg.) In the years after, Albert continued to write Victoria letters. But at age 18, Victoria was crowned queen. She had grown up under the care of a controlling widowed mother and the reviled John Conroy (her mother’s comptroller), so she relished her newfound freedom and had no desire to marry. Albert came to England with the intention of telling her that she could no longer string him along. However, on this occasion, Victoria was instantly taken with him.

She was very nervous and said in her proposal that she knew Albert would have to give up a lot to be with her. Albert, of course, said yes. \nAlbert Essentially Gave Up His Home to Be With Her Albert moved to England to marry Victoria, and afterward he never lived in Germany again. Albert missed his homeland, especially its nature, which greatly differed from London’s. Expand Queen Victoria and Prince Albert with their children, 1846.

Despite this genuine adoration, the couple was not without conflict. Victoria had been prone to temper tantrums since childhood, which Albert, in particular, did not like. They Had Nine Children After their wedding, Victoria quickly became pregnant with the couple’s first child—a daughter named Victoria. Over a 17-year period, she gave birth to nine children. An impressive fact, especially since childbirth carried with it a considerable amount of risk in the 1800s. Victoria disliked being pregnant and often complained about it.

However, over time she began to rely more and more on him, especially during the periods in which she was pregnant or recovering from childbirth. Albert dedicated himself to his work and tirelessly championed the causes that he was passionate about. One of his greatest accomplishments was the Great Exhibition of 1851.

She had monuments and statues built in her late husband’s honor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:07:25.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
