But one person who is giving him tough competition, when it comes to winning hearts, is none other than his youngest son, AbRam. This baby is beyond adorable, and fans of the star cannot get enough of the little munchkin. And, thankfully, SRK is cool enough to often share pictures of his little one, too. The most recent picture he shared of him will also win your hearts, especially if you're a comic book fan. In the picture, AbRam is sitting in a ball pit surrounded by a Spider-Man balloon and toy, dressed as Spider-Man himself! This is not the first time the father-son duo has shared their love for the beloved comic book, and film character. In the past, SRK put up a video of them both wearing Spider-Man masks, and it was the cutest thing.

And we think it might even have to do with the release of the newest Spider-man: Homecoming trailer. We couldn't think of a more super father-son duo to embody one of our favourite superheroes. Check out the cute picture, here.
