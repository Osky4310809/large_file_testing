The bass throttles in, leading the beat in a simple, yet smooth trudge, bringing the tempo to just around the heartbeat. \nA deep breath yields a new instrument. \nThe synth kicks in, adding a new layer to the bass, yet in a somehow higher and more screeching tone, occupying the ear, raising hair on the back of the neck. The trombonist raises his beaten up trombone, which looks as if it was dragged through the battlefields of World War I, adding a somber yet enticing flavor to the music. Finally, the guitars join the fray with enough effects to trip the power. Reverberation fills the room as the guitars solo in tandem. \nIt only took about a minute for a completely improvised beat to sound like a fully-fledged song. That’s just the mark of good musicians. \nAnd that’s exactly what the Carpetland Flux Collective is: a State College psychedelic band known for their incredible musicianship along with a penchant for experimentation. \nHowever, they don’t want you to think that they’re a band. Instead, the Carpetland Flux Collective is just that; a collective of friends that create things together. \nWhile their main creations so far have been music, they don’t want to be thrown in the same category as a band that eats and sleeps together. Instead, Carpetland is a group of individuals that build off one another to create innovative art, each adding their own strengths and tastes into the mix. \nThe Carpetland Flux Collective has many members, although the core group consists of John Ott (junior-integrative arts) on guitar and vocals, Sam Christensen on guitar and vocals, Ryan Zieminski on piano and synths, Dan Hosterman on bass, and Evan Callaghan (senior-energy business and finance) on drums. Although that may be the roles of the group on paper, they switch instruments often. There are no real definites with the Carpetland members. Everything is a gut reaction to the situation at hand. \n“Everyone come together, it really is a collective,” Zieminski said. Carpetland regularly collaborates with other bands in the area. In that sense, everyone that contributes to the Carpetland Flux Collective’s music is a member. Even if you’re just a “homie,” you’re a part of the Collective. +3 Buy Now \nRyan Zieminski (21) of State College plays on a synthesizer as Dan Hosterarm (23) of State College plays the guitar with the Carpetlands Flux Collective at one of the band members homes in State College, Pa. on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017. Natalie Runnerstrom \nJust before the interview began, the mainstays of Carpetland Flux Collective were relaxing with Tommy Gargiulo and Riley Seiders (senior-English) of another local band known as the Crater and the Catalyst, a math rock band with a penchant for incredibly technical, yet primal music. After the interview, the two groups up jamming with the Carpetland boys just after the interview to give a taste of Carpetland. \nAlthough Carpetland has had relative success in State College, their history is brief, spanning not even two years. Ott met Christensen at a concert and realized they had similar music taste. Christensen had previously met Zieminski and found common ground as well. It was only a matter of time before they decided to get together for a jam, and Carpetland was born. They added Callaghan and Hosterman shortly after. \nIn April of 2016, they made their debut with their EP, “Feels Like A Lot,” a six song glimpse at their dense, psychedelic sound. \nSince then, Carpetland has gone on a mini tour, played small shows around State College, opened up for larger shows such as the band Cymbals Eat Guitars at Chronic Town, and begun work on a new album, slated to be a full album of around 12-14 songs. +3 \nRiley Seiders (junior-English) plays the trombone during a practice session with the Carpetlands Flux Collective at one of the band members homes in State College, Pa. on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017. Natalie Runnerstrom \nIn a Carpetland interview in September by Nick At Nite at the Lion 90.7, Zieminski said he’d be surprised if the album wasn’t completed by the end of winter. \nWhen that statement was posed to them, they all laughed and said, “And now it’s mid-February.” \nOtt clarified and said, “The album might be 40-50 percent finished at most.” \nThey said they’ve been picking up steam, but were adamant about not rushing anything. They’re not big on deadlines, because in their eyes it might hurry out music they didn’t spend enough time on. \n“Why release an album with only like four diamonds and the rest is sand, you know,” Zieminski said. \nWith no due date and a studio setup in their basement, Carpetland essentially has the keys to the city. Ott said they have easily 50 files of music to work on in the future. \nThere are plans for the upcoming album to be a narrative however, which might explain why they’re taking their time with the album. Everything must fit in correctly to them. They are “building the Lego palace,” as Hosterman said. \nThe album will feature music from all members of the core group, each member contributing their own songs to the album. It’ll bring a lot of different sounds, ranging from their psychedelic roots, to funk, to trap, to music from the Final Fantasy video game series. \nAs it turns out, Final Fantasy is one of Carpetland’s biggest influences. Zieminski even said he has Final Fantasy sheet music. \nWhile the album is nowhere near completion, Ott said they will push for a summer release, jokingly saying, “If it’s not finished by summer, we’re abandoning it.” +3 \nCarpetlands Flux Collective hangs out at one of the band members homes in State College, Pa. on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017. Natalie Runnerstrom \nThey also have a jam album nearing release, which will feature all instrumental jams of improvised music. \nIt’s been quiet since Nick at Nite’s interview of Carpetland’s current projects. They’ve largely been in hibernation since then, electing to don the lab coats and experiment with sound. \nMake no mistake, whatever Carpetland is up to, they’re going to do their damned best to blow your mind and if you ever meet them, they’ll welcome you with open arms. That is the way of Carpetlands after all. \nAs Zieminski put it, Carpetland is a “benevolent cult” and everyone is welcome to come hangout.
