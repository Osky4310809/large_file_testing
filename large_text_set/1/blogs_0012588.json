When they asked \"how do you feel about playing Aquaman in the solo film?\", he said \"Stoked. Are we still on one word? The standalone Aquaman movie, I'm really pumped about it. I start in four or five months so, a little bit of rest and then back into it. Justice League was amazing, but it's going to be fun to have the arc and talk about this guy's backstory and where he's going.\" \nMomoa actually made his DC film debut in director Zack Snyder's Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice , but Justice League will be the first time fans really get to see the hero up close, as well as the first introduction of his Queen Mera, who is being played by Amber Heard. Since he's starting production in a mere few months, hopefully fans will find out more about the project soon. \nFans will next have a chance to see Momoa in Zack Snyder's Justice League film, where he'll team up with Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Superman (Henry Cavill), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). \nAquaman is directed by James Wan with Will Beall, Geoff Johns, Paul Norris, and Mort Weisinger on writing duties. Rob Cowan is serving as executive producer and Deborah Snyder and Zack Snyder serving as producers. The film stars Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Amber Heard (Mera), Patrick Wilson (Orm) and Willem Dafoe (Nuidis Vulko). \nMORE DC Films News: Learn More About Aquaman's Jason Momoa In This Touching Video / Amber Heard Returning To Gold Coast To Film Aquaman / 5 Reasons You Should Be Reading Aquaman / Director Shares New Look At Aquaman / Jason Momoa Aquaman Photos Revealed / Aquaman Release Delayed / Why Jason Momoa Identifies With Aquaman / Jason Momoa, Amber Heard To Appear On DC Comics Comic Book Covers / Aquaman Working Title Reveal \nWonder Woman opens in theaters on June 2, 2017, followed by Justice League on November 17, 2017, Aquaman on July 27, 2018, The Flash on March 16, 2018, an untitled DC Film on October 5, 2018, Shazam on April 5, 2019, Justice League 2 on June 14, 2019, an untitled DC film on November 1, 2019, Cyborg on April 3, 2020, and Green Lantern Corps on July 24, 2020.
