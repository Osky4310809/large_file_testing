He is a Hollywood elitist.\"\nClooney's number is off in that assessment, but not by much. In 2015, one of Trump's financial-disclosure forms revealed that he had $110,228 in a SAG pension fund. That sum, which seems surprisingly high, comes mostly courtesy of his hosting gigs on The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice . Trump has also made several cameo appearances in movies like Home Alone 2 and TV shows like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air . Representatives for SAG-AFTRA, as well as for Trump, have not yet responded to Vanity Fair 's request for comment.\nClooney continued by turning his attention to Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart, a site notorious for publishing white-nationalist content, who serves as Trump's trusted adviser. \"Steve Bannon is a failed film writer,\" the Oscar-winning actor said, noting that Bannon tried to write a Shakespearean-inspired rap movie about the L.A. riots. Clooney also referenced Bannon's cushy Seinfeld residuals: in 1993, the strategist purchased a share of the famous comedy, and still collects royalties from its reruns.\n\"He's an elitist,\" Clooney said. \"That's the reality.\"\nFor good measure, Clooney also defended Meryl Streep , whose moving speech at this year's Golden Globes about the need for compassion in the Trump era drew massive backlash from conservatives. Trump himself unleashed his easily provoked Twitter fingers on the iconic actress, calling his onetime favorite \"overrated\" and a \"Hillary flunky who lost big.\" If Clooney is lucky, he'll be getting the POTUS Twitter treatment any day now.\nRELATED: Photos of George's wife, Amal: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:16:09.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
