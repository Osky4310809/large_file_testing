Here, Nina talks about how she organizes her freezer, what she makes in advance, and the simple sides that make dinner easy all month. \nThe freezer is essential for month-long cooking. I'm fortunate now that we do have an extra freezer devoted to meal planning, but that wasn't always the case. \nIn order to make the most out of your freezer space, make sure to keep everything organized. I lay my bags flat on a cookie sheet and put the whole thing in the freezer for an hour or so until they're fairly frozen. Then you can remove them from the cookie sheet and they will be a nice, flat shape that is easily stackable. \nRelated : The Best Way to Organize Your Freezer \nMulti-tasking and purchasing meat in bulk is the key to making your cooking day go quickly. I have pork roasts going in both Crock-Pots while all four burners have frying pans filled with browning ground beef. While that's cooking, I mix up a large batch of marinade (teriyaki is a favorite) that will get split between various kinds of meat. By using different meats (salmon, chicken, pork, shrimp, etc.), it feels like you are eating different meals even though you are using the same marinade. \nOnce you have your protein in the freezer, you need to think sides. For sides, as you're getting used to a new routine, make sure you stock up on boxes of rice, a box of Bisquick for quick biscuits, boxes of pasta, potatoes, and other similar things. You can throw some potatoes in the oven, top them with a bag of shredded pulled pork, and serve with a side of broccoli with only about 5 to 10 minutes of effort after a long day of work. \nRead more : Freezer Meals on Today's Prices Ready to Try It?
