By this point the jolt was out of the lightning bolt. \nOn Saturday, the last — won’t say final — version was on display on the screen at Staples Center when the Clippers played host to the Lakers. \nThe reaction followed the pattern that has been created this week. They just showed the new #Chargers logo and their tight end at the #Clippers / #Lakers game. Nothing but \"boos!\" Welcome to LA. pic.twitter.com/DhhlVvI9Ec \n— Taji #RaiderNation (@InfiniteRaiders) January 14, 2017 Los Angeles Chargers logo flashes on scoreboard – booed by Lakers/Clippers fans alike.
