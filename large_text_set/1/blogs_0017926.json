While all along, there’s never been any concrete plan to bring the series back for a fifth season, there’s always been the hope that it might return. The showrunners are game to do more . Stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are game to do more. So what’s stopping the show from continuing?\nSupposedly, Benedict and Martin. The two are extremely busy right now, if you haven’t noticed, but according to a bummer rumor, the show won’t be back because Benedict and Martin don’t like each other.\nRecord scratch, say wh t ?\nAccording The Sun (which, just remember, is basically the British equivalent of American tabloid, National Enquire) , Benedict and Martin don’t want to return because they’re no longer as close as they used to be. A source close to the two explained to the publication: “They aren’t mates and they don’t spend time together away from the show.” Another quote alleges that the pair are polite and professional, but lack warmth. It continues, “There isn’t a huge desire to come back for another season.”\nOf course, all of The Sun’s sources are totally anonymous. The publication refers to the sources as “pals” of the two actors. However, without anything more concrete, we’re definitely skeptical. And last we checked, we *also* considered ourselves ~pals~ of our internet boyfriends Benedict and Martin so…\n\nThere’s really no actual proof that the Sherlock stars don’t like each other. But even if they aren’t BFFs, that doesn’t necessarily mean we wouldn’t see more seasons. After all, acting is a job — and people in any job don’t always like their coworkers.\nPlus, both actors have gone one record saying how much they enjoy working on the show, and considering how much the INTERNET LOVES SHERLOCK, we’d know if there was on-set animosity. Benedict himself has even recently hinted at making more episodes, telling Metro , “We love doing the show and all I’ll say about it is that we’re all very busy… For now, it’s not going to happen again at the same regularity that it has been happening.”\nSo TBH, Benedict and Martin not being mates sounds like a bonkers rumor. After all, the fact that both actors have busy schedules is totally the truth. Keep holding out for more Sherlock , friends.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T04:02:18.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
