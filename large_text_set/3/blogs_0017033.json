Thanks to the internet, a lot of people have been asking the employees to get creative with jokes, doodles, even a few lighthearted insults from time to time. This strange request, however, might take the cake (or pie). \nA Domino’s customer named Ford shook things up a bit with his delivery instructions. Instead of telling them to turn left at the Seven Eleven or type in a code at the gate, Ford wrote: “send me ur baddest bitch plzzzz.” 2 \nThis was a ballsy move, you don’t want to offend anyone at Domino’s and end up blacklisted from any future deliveries (can you imagine?!), but the pizza company came through in the form of one badass delivery man. If flashing a $20 bill and squatting with the pizza boxes still in hand didn’t satisfy Ford, I don’t really know what he was looking for in the first place. 3 \nTo further reinforce that they did in fact deliver on his request, the worker who took his order wrote “we did” right on the box, with the instructions posted as well. 4 \nOf course Ford tweeted this (unconventional?) exchange and everyone loved it. Hopefully the “baddest” dude got a tip worthy of his efforts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:30:25.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
