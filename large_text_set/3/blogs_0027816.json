If a lady is petite or skinny, chances are that she also has a bony vagina. Gynaecologists say this type of vagina is more narrow and bonier than most. “The exciting part about it is that it allows for a tighter fit that ensures a sensational sexual experience. The worrying part is that it can be a little uncomfortable when a sensitive body part is conjoined with a bony one,” says sexologist, Adrian O’Neilly. \n• Full lip vagina. Simply put, the woman has plumper lips than the rest. They are so pert that they practically scream for attention. And, they’re kissable too. According to O’Neilly, “men love fat lipped vaginas because they are always very soft to the touch, very inviting and easier to find for penetration.” \n• The shaved vagina. What this says about a woman is that she’s so into making sure everything is clean shaven, prim and proper, and the sexiest of the pack. “Guys definitely notice when a woman puts a great deal of work into keeping her vagina perfectly tamed,” O’Neilly assures. \n• The expert vagina. Well, the expert vagina shows an experienced lady! She’s got those wide alleys for easy entry—or so male respondents told O’Neilly! But then, the truth is, the vagina expands as a woman becomes aroused. The only downside is that a guy might be worried that he isn’t going to be able to please his woman! \n• The accessorized vagina. This woman loves to accessorize, with lots of extra skin in the surrounding area. “The common misconception is that this type of vagina seems like its old, run down, tired or just got off a major diet. Fortunately, men really don’t mind the extra skin, so don’t be afraid to embrace it,” O’Neilly says. \n• The 70s vagina. What it means is that this lady’s got a thing for comfort and relaxation and her vagina shows it. Shaving down there really isn’t a priority for her. For the most part, guys don’t normally have an issue with an unshaven vagina, so don’t feel obligated to start a new shaving regimen, O’Neilly says. \n• The virginal vagina. What this indicates is that the lady’s body is as tight as it gets from those slender arms to that tight vagina. In fact, the walls may actually be closing in. “If you own one of these, you’re in luck because guys give this one two thumbs up. The snug fit allows for heightened sensations and a major confidence boost. Guys never have to worry about whether or not they are big enough and the close fit definitely makes them think your vagina was made specifically for them,” the sex expert says. \n• The peek-a-boo vagina. The lady concerned has that clitoris that is out just enough to give the perfect tease. According to O’Neilly, a perky clitoris makes for the perfect plaything for the male species. Plus, they love the bigger orgasms girls seem to get with these. It makes them feel like they did their job just right. \nThe bottom line: Vaginas come in all shapes and sizes and there is no such thing as the ‘perfect vagina.’ Rather, a good man will love his woman despite the type of vagina she happens to have. As for the woman, learn to embrace your vagina, regardless of what it looks like.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:06:02.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
