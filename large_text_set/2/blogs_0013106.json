And in a change, it's moving from San Francisco, where it's been held the past few years, to San Jose. \nSan Jose is much closer to Apple's two campuses in Cupertino, California. Although Apple's new Apple Campus 2 isn't yet finished, it could be close to complete by June, which suggests that Apple could hold some events or talks at its new \" spaceship \" headquarters. \nFrom the announcement : \" Located just minutes from Appleâ€™s new headquarters in Cupertino, WWDC 2017 will give developers access to more than 1,000 Apple engineers with opportunities to meet and engage with them throughout the conference.\" \nDevelopers interested in attending can sign up for a lottery starting March 27, but in order to register, you need to be a member of Apple's developer program as of Thursday. \nPhil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, said to The Loop that Apple will stream its sessions and talks for developers who may not be able to attend. \nApple describes this year's conference on its website using language that echoes remarks that former CEO Steve Jobs previously said: Technology alone is not enough.Technology must intersect with the liberal arts and the humanities, to create new ideas and experiences that push society forward. This summer we bring together thousands of brilliant minds representing many diverse perspectives, passions, and talents to help us change the world. \nBusiness Insider will be covering WWDC and any announcements Apple decides to make at its largest and only annual developer conference. \nIn the recent past, Apple has only announced new software features for iPhones and Macs, but the company has also historically revealed new hardware at the event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:14:14.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
