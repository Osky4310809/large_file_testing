As you are aware, that version is barred from appearing on The Late Show for legal reasons. That means we got a slightly different version instead, arriving from his cabin in the woods to do tonight’s “WERD” and not the legally troublesome “The Word” from that other guy’s show. Just think about Vanilla’s Ice’s excuse for his sampling of Queen’s Under Pressure. Those slight differences are so important.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T06:31:23.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
