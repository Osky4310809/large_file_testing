Canadian Press January 31, 2017, 10:21 PM Canadian Press January 31, 2017, 10:21 PM \nMONTREAL — Max Pacioretty scored a hat trick as the Montreal Canadiens beat the visiting Buffalo Sabres 5-2 on Tuesday night in the first game back for both teams since the NHL all-star break. \nDavid Desharnais and Paul Byron also scored for Montreal (30-14-7), while Carey Price made 36 saves. Alexander Radulov and Phillip Danault each had two assists. \nDmitry Kulikov and Brian Gionta scored for Buffalo (20-20-9) late in the third period. Robin Lehner stopped 30-of-35 shots. \nPacioretty scored once per period en route to his second hat trick of the season. \nHis first of the night made it 1-0 at 17:27 of the first period. The Canadiens captain took a nifty backhand saucer pass from Radulov and roofed the puck on Lehner, who tried a traditional stack-the-pads save but got nowhere near the shot. \nPacioretty added his second at 7:48 of the middle frame, again cashing in a pass from Radulov from behind Lehner's net. \nWith Montreal already leading 4-0 in the third period, Pacioretty got his stick on a loose puck in a frantic goal-mouth scramble. The goals were his team-leading 22nd, 23rd and 24th of the year. \nMontreal is now 11-4-2 in its last 17 games versus Buffalo. \nDefenceman Nikita Nesterov made his Canadiens debut after being traded from the Tampa Bay Lightning last week. \nAndrei Markov (lower-body injury) played his first game in six weeks. Markov and Nesterov skated together on the third defensive pairing. \nDesharnais was also back in the lineup after missing 24 games with a knee injury. \nThe Sabres and Canadiens met less than two weeks ago, with Buffalo leaving the Bell Centre with a 3-2 come-from-behind overtime victory. \nBut in Tuesday's contest the Canadiens secured the lead in the first period and never gave it up. \nAfter Pacioretty's first two goals, Desharnais celebrated his return from injury with his fourth goal of the year. The Habs centreman made it 3-0 for the home side after a bad giveaway by Cody Franson deep in his own zone. \nByron added Montreal's fourth goal of the evening, completing a tic-tac-toe play started by Artturi Lehkonen, Tomas Plekanec and Markov. \nKulikov broke Price's shutout bid with a shot from the point with 3:28 remaining in the game and Gionta added another for Buffalo less than two minutes later. \nNotes: Jeff Petry (flu) was not in the lineup for Montreal. Greg Pateryn got the start in his place. ...Pacioretty has at least one point in 10 straight games versus the Sabres. ... Before puck drop, the Canadiens held a moment of silence for the victims of Sunday's Quebec City mosque shooting.
