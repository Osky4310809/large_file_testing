Image copyright DFID/ESP Image caption According to DfID, UK support is currently reaching 154,000 Ugandan senior citizens \nThe ICAI acknowledged that some of the programmes funded by the UK had experienced teething problems. \nIn Nigeria, for example, workers on a project giving cash to vulnerable expectant mothers had to introduce random pregnancy tests after some women who weren't pregnant joined the scheme. \nBut the commission said DfID \"should consider scaling up its financial contributions\" where there was evidence of support from national governments. \nThe department has a target of reaching six million people a year through the schemes, including programmes targeting pregnant women and new mothers in Nigeria, elderly people in Uganda and parents in Pakistan who receive payments if their children attend school. 'Cut out the middle man' \nOxfam's head of UK policy Tim Livesey said the report confirmed what many in the sector already knew, that cash payments could be \"one of the best, fastest and safest ways to help people\". \nA DfID spokesman said: \"Cash transfers get aid to those who need it, when they need it, and achieve value for taxpayers' money - and this independent report recognises that. \n\"Small cash transfers can be the difference between food and no food for families who are living on less than two dollars a day. They empower people to make decisions about what they need, cut out the middle man, and reduce waste.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T05:16:44.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
