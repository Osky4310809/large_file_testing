A couple of days ago, on the occasion of Women’s Day, Mira gave an interview, where she spoke about about her stance on feminism and how she feels on being a housewife . For those of you who missed it, here’s what she said. \nI had a tough pregnancy, I went to those 5 months of difficult times to bring my daughter into this world. So now I want to spend every moment that I can with her and I think there is a set of responsibilities around my plate and I feel at my age I have a lot more energy, I have my future ahead of me, so I can finish all of my responsibility and I have nothing in my way. I can raise my daughter, I can be a good wife. Nothing will stop me after that. I love being at home, I love being a mother to my child, I wouldn’t want to spend one hour a day with my child and rush off to work, why did I have her? She is not a puppy; I want to be there for her as a mother. Feminism isn’t woman versus man. It’s about equality. A new wave of feminism has come that is aggressive… I feel it’s destructive. There’s a new term called ‘feminazi’, which is the female equivalent of a chauvinist. I think there should be harmony between the two sexes and equilibrium. \nThis didn’t go down well at all with other women, especially working women, because it seemed like she was belittling them. Her college mate (whose name hasn’t been revealed by Deccan Chronicle), wrote an open letter on her Facebook to lash out at Mira for her misinformed feminist comments. Dear Mira, Having watched your interview, I feel extremely enraged today. I’ve spent three years in the same college and batch as you. I can say today with confidence that your idea of feminism is extremely flawed. Seeing you walk around with your posse in college, belittling women who were not skinny enough or did not subscribe to your fashion ‘standards’ makes me wonder what you ever did to have a moral high ground over anyone at any point. Your narrow world view is astounding, to say the least. And not to forget, how your statement about working mothers takes us years back in reaching actual empowerment of which you seem to know nothing. With lots of aggression, When husband Shahid Kapoor was asked about his take, he fully supported his wife . 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T08:47:54.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
