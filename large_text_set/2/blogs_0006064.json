I will not force them, of course,\" Alvarez told reporters in an ambush interview. \nThe House speaker also warned deputy speakers, committee chairs and vice chairs that they will be replaced if they vote against the reimposition of capital punishment. \n\"'Pag deputy speaker ka pangit naman na hindi ka sang-ayon doon sa administration-sponsored bill, at saka 'pag chairman ka nung committees,\" Alvarez said. \nThe House leaders may also opt to leave the supermajority if they will go against the administration-sponsored bill.
