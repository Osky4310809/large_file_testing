(@EdelpOficial) 15 de enero de 2017 \nVeron also took control of the Pincha's set-pieces, with his deliveries keeping Bahia on the back foot. \nEstudiantes will be hoping the years haven't taken their toll on the veteran of the 2002 and 2010 World Cups, as they fight for silverware on two fronts during 2017. \nThe club currently lie fourth in the Primera Division after 14 games, four points shy of leaders Boca Juniors, while they will also fight for the Copa Libertadores over the course of the year.
