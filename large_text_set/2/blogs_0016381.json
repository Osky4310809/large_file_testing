(Photo: Getty Images) More Paris Hilton’s personal style is unapologetically feminine and all about the glamour. The blonde heiress and perfume mogul might not be a style icon in the traditional sense, but she definitely has an aesthetic and sticks to it. Sunday, she rocked an extra special, Hilton-esque number to collect her award for Fragrance of the Year at the 3rd annual Hollywood Beauty Awards. Hilton nabbed the honor for her Gold Rush scent, so of course Miss Thing needed something sparkly for the occasion – like this Swarovski crystal-laden gown by August Getty. The Internet personality and subject of This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous wore a custom August Getty Atelier gown that was made with Swarovski crystals to her premiere. (Photo: Getty Images) More If the piece looks familiar, it’s because we’ve already seen it on Gigi Gorgeous, who wore it for the premiere of her movie , This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous at the Sundance Film Festival. The piece, bedazzled with 500,000 Swarovski crystals ($270,000 worth) is what Getty calls the “million dollar dress.” As we’ve mentioned, the piece is crafted from Swarovski Crystal mesh, and hand-sewn with silver metal thread. “It took over two months to complete and over six months of technical design, with as many as five people working on it at the same time,” the designer told Yahoo Style in January. Getty Instagrammed an image of Paris in the dress, saying how happy he was to “pass this crystal wonder on to yet another #GettyGirl .” We think both women looked ah -mazing in the dress!
