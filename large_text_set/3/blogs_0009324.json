I'm looking forward to the opportunity to get a little more playing time with those guys gone.\" \nMeadows, the organization's No. 2 overall prospect according to MLBPipeline.com, has made the most of it reaching base safely in seven of his first eight Spring Training games, and hitting his first home run Tuesday against Atlanta. It's an impressive start, and his teammates have taken notice. Meadows on Spring Training ATL@PIT: Meadows talks about his spring success Austin Meadows talks about his success so far during Spring Training and his rise from the Minors after being a first-round Draft pick in 2013 \n\"He's an unbelievable guy, unbelievable hitter, a great player, a good person.\" Pirates outfielder Jose Osuna said. \"A lot of chances to make the Majors very soon.\" \nFinding a Major League home isn't easy when the starting outfield is such a solid trio, but Meadows has turned it into a positive: He's learned a lot from the likes of McCutchen, Marte and Polanco. \n\"We have a lot of fun out there, it's really loose,\" Meadows said. \"I learn some stuff from them, how they go about their business. It was really fun to be out there with those guys each and every day before they left.\" \nThe biggest lesson Meadows took from his veteran outfield was the importance of staying healthy, something he couldn't do a year ago. A hamstring injury limited Meadows to just 87 games, but he still managed to hit .266 with 12 home runs, 25 doubles, 11 triples and 17 stolen bases. \n\"I've established a program this offseason,\" he said. \"I realized the more I'm healthy, the more consistent I can be. When you're up and down health-wise, it's a little bit tougher to be consistent. I'm looking forward to this year, I've learned a lot, definitely.\" Top Prospects: Meadows, PIT Top Prospects: Austin Meadows, OF, Pirates 2017 MLB.com Top Prospects: Austin Meadows has an advanced approach at the plate and his innate ability to hit for average \nMeadows said his focus this spring is on becoming more aggressive at the plate, and not trying to rush his path to the Majors. \n\"I really don't try to think too outside the box, I really try to stay within myself, that's kind of how I've always been,\" he said. \"I really let my plan just take care of anything. I really just let everything just happen. I don't try to [think] I should be here or I should be there, I really just try to enjoy the ride.\" \nAn unusual ride of playing with an idle starting outfield, but Meadows is pulling for his teammates. \n\"We'll see. They might end up in the championship,\" he said. \"Those two [teams], Dominican [Republic] and USA, I'm rooting them on for sure.\" \nIn the meantime, Meadows hopes to keep making the most of his opportunity.
