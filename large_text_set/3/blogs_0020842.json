When Michael Phelps went to Starbucks, his barista got creative with the names. And while for most of us ‘creative’ names on our cups mean wildly inaccurate and baffling misspellings of names we always thought were very intuitive to spell, for Michael Phelps it means being paid a massive compliment, with a little bit of humor on the side.\nMichael Phelps, his wife, and a friend all went to Starbucks, and the barista labeled their cups “GOAT,” “Wife of GOAT,” and “Friend of GOAT.” In case you’re not up to date on your acronyms, GOAT stands for “greatest of all time.” Interesting names on our Starbucks cups today made us all laugh #hiltonvillage \nA post shared by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on Mar 20, 2017 at 11:11am PDT \nMichael Phelps shared an Instagram of the cups with the caption:\n“Interesting names on our Starbucks cups today made us all laugh” \nAll we can think, though, is that we’re r ally glad that Michael Phelps, his wife, and their friend all were familiar with what GOAT stands for, because if they didn’t, this could’ve been a really awkward situation if they’d assumed GOAT was some kind of strange insult. “Ugh, that guy? What a goat.”\nAlso, in case you weren’t aware, Michael Phelps and his wife are literally one of the cutest couples of all time. Recently, they visited Europe and they’re just #relationshipgoals all over the place. We’re not sure we’ve ever seen a couple that’s so Instagrammable.\nI really didn't know it would be this amazing ... love ❤️ \nA post shared by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on Feb 16, 2017 at 5:13pm PST \nLiterally too cute to handle.\nFun day yesterday! @mrs.nicolephelps #paris \nA post shared by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on Feb 18, 2017 at 6:15am PST \nNow that this joke has been made, though, baristas are going to have to step up their game to impress The GOAT , and we’re looking forward to seeing what they come up with.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:54:50.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
