Speed of your thrusts? The duration of your sessions? Frequency? How many different positions you use in the period of a week, month or year? Ever wondered how you stack up to other people from around the world? Welcome to the future of wearable technology in the bedroom.”\nThe i.Con is described as a wearable, Micro-USB charged condom ring that can provide six to eight hours of “live” usage.\nAccording to Mashable , the device uses a nano-chip and sensors to catalog numerous variables during sex — including penis girth, the “average velocity” and total number of thrusts per session.\nIt will also log other info pertaining to one’s health, such as calories burned and average skin temperature. British Condoms also claims that the i.Con can work as an STI indicator, thanks to it’s “antibodies” filter” — which alerts the user when proteins or antigens, typically found in STIs, are detected.\nEach device is made from synthetic rubber and contains a waterproof carbon fiber unit, which holds the nano-chip and sensors, Mashable reports.\nThey will be made in one size, with a “band adjustment feature,” the company says.\nOnce the user is done doing the deed, the data from their session is loaded onto their phone — either through the i.Con app or micro USB port.\n“All data will be kept anonymous but users will have the option to share their recent data with friends, or, indeed the world,” British Condoms says. “You will be able to anonymously access stats that you can compare with i.Con users worldwide.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:42:16.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
