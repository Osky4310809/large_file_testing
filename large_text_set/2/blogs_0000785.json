You want to have them around on your big day, get their inputs, and share the love. However, you do need to realise that not everyone is going to be happy for you - it's only natural. Rather than feeling bad about these people, and wasting your time and energy, it is better to keep them away from your shaadi . Invite them to the wedding if you have to, but don't include them in the planning process. Your Ex \nYour might be best friends with your ex, however it is only sensible to not involve him/her in your wedding planning. To be honest, wedding stress is going to lead you to have a few major fights with your SO (significant other) and you don't need the ex standing beside you, while you wonder if things would be different if you were getting married to them instead. Trust us, this is the last question you want to be tackling right now, especially when you are emotionally vulnerable. You can invite them to the wedding, but take major wedding decisions on your own. Friends who are not convinced \nDoubts before a wedding are always there but as long as your gut says it is right, go for it. While you are planning a wedding, you really don't need people who are not 100 percent convinced, about your choice of partner, to be involved. A friend who doesn't like the groom/bride, a relative who wants you married to her cousin instead, or someone who just wants to sabotage your big day... keep them away. The bossy relative/friend \nIt is your big day and you get to do it the way you want. People will want to help, but not all of them will do it in a friendly manner. Don't let people convince you that their way is better than yours. Some people love to control things, and your wedding could be the perfect excuse for them to take charge. Best thing, don't invite them during the planning stage. Drama lovers \nThere are some people who have the ability to make everything about themselves. It's best to steer clear of these drama mongers, and plan your wedding with people who genuinely care about your happiness.
