For the next man, it is all laid there in front of him. \nThe club is in a world famous city, attracts 60,000 fans to matches, is a huge revenue generator, has lots of cash in the bank and a fine domestic history. \nBut if you are the likes of Diego Simeone, Thomas Tuchel , Jorge Sampaoli, Max Allegri you would think ‘if Wenger is going to stay for another two or three years, in that time the Bayern Munich job might come up. Or the jobs at Chelsea, Liverpool or perhaps even Manchester United.’ The Wenger Out brigade are in full voice at the moment (Photo: AFP) \nAll clubs with much better pedigree than Arsenal domestically and in Europe. \nSurely Arsenal’s owner Stan Kroenke can see that not only are there managers out there like Jose Mourinho, Antonio Conte, Sampaoli, Allegri, Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola who are winning trophies but they are also younger and fresher. \nWenger is now an analogue manager in a digital age. \nIf anybody thinks Wenger is winning the Champions League next season or the league in the next couple of seasons they are deluded. \nWhen I look at Arsenal’s situation now I have to detach myself from everything I’ve ever written and every caveat such as Wenger is a lovely bloke and he brought us the Invincibles. \nWhen I look at what is presented in front of me I see a manager who has not won a top level title in over a decade.

For me it is quite simple. He has to go. \nWhat Arsenal need now to answer all the criticism from fans and pundits is bottle, grit, determination and leadership. Simeone has all those things and is what Arsenal need. \nHe earns around half of the £8m-a-year Wenger gets and has managed to break up Barcelona and Real Madrid’s dominance in Spain, get into Champions League finals while having to sell his best players every couple of years. \nIf they were to bring in Simeone the question I’d have for anyone pro-Wenger is would you be more or less confident of Simeone buying winners, better players, shaking up the existing squad and the two world class players at the club? Diego Simeone would be a great fit at the Emirates (Photo: AFP) \nThe answer is surely you would be more confident. \nIt also has to be said that in terms of how the club is run, Stan Kroenke is an absolute disgrace. He obviously doesn’t care about being competitive in the Premier League or Champions League. \nWhat he cares about is keeping the tills ringing, making Arsenal a business that is in the black and making sure their asset is worth more in years to come. \nThat has bred a group of people that run the club led by Kroenke but also with Wenger in it that are happy to just do the bare minimum while deluding their fans into thinking they will win something big.
