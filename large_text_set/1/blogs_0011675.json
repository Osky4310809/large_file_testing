For DJ/promoter Jason Lavitt it became his entire life. From Valley goth-boy to zealous clubster to fledgling DJ to the promoter and music curator behind some of Los Angeles’ most popular dance clubs, Lavitt’s club love might be unrivaled in this city. (Disclosure: Having covered nightlife for about just as long as he’s been doing events, I’ve gotten to know Jason Lavitt pretty well and consider him a good friend.) \nLavitt has been conceptualizing, promoting and providing the soundtrack for multiple generations over two decades now, and this three-day MLK Day weekend, he’s got several events that represent his diversity and longevity. \nClub 90s, paying tribute to hitmakers of the decade (Friday is *NSync night) is the party he throws with veteran promoter/DJ Bruce Perdew and DJ Jeffrey Lyman, currently at Los Globos. It’s become one of his most successful clubs ever, meshing pop hits with theme-driven dress-up, photo booths and giveaways. This Saturday, the 90s brand’s more intimate off-shoot, which spotlights more alternative sounds and artists, offers a Nine Inch Nails vs. Depeche Mode night at the Lash. \n“The big '90s party is a younger, more pop-driven crowd and it’s just crazy,” explains Lavitt. “The Lash parties allow us to play other stuff and it seems to attract a bit older groups who like things more intimate.” Club 90s Flyer Courtesy Club 90s \nThe ability to home in on what works for his crowds and what doesn’t is something that Lavitt has clearly perfected over his many years behind the decks at his own parties and on the dance floors of others. Several years ago, we discovered that we possessed a similar enthusiasm and stamina level for club-hopping on a given night, so he and I would make plans to hit multiple venues together, hoping to soak up their varied vibes. We called them “club tours,” and our record for different spots in one night was six, if I remember correctly.

He would talk about his night club on the Sunset Strip, the girls in glitter tube tops, Elton John and Elvis Presley in his VIP area, the glitter rock records he would bring over from London that he’d play. ... Rodney was an instant idol who schooled me on the nightclub scene.” Lavitt would go on to spin beside his idol at a glam club they co-created called Flash and revive Bingenheimer’s legendary English Disco for a stint as well. \nLike many SoCal adolescents, Lavitt rebelled against fun-in-the-sun stereotypes and became a black-wearing denizen of dark dance music. Being gay, he saw the goth clubs as a welcoming haven for self-expression, in both fashion and sexuality. “The gothic scene was the first huge thing for me. If I went dancing in Hollywood during the '80s, chances are I’d turn up at a goth club. Michael Stewart and Bruce Perdew spun amazing DJ sets at clubs like Helter Skelter and Scream. I was at all of them every week.” \nHis enthusiasm eventually led to working at the clubs, learning from Stewart and Perdew and ultimately joining them behind the decks at their Evil Club Empire events. Later, he joined forces with Joseph Brooks, owner of the import-driven record store on Melrose called Vinyl Fetish, and DJ at both Scream and glam-rock haven the Cathouse. Brooks took the glam-rock resurgence of the '80s and revived it in the '90s with Lavitt’s help, throwing a bodacious monthly party known as Club Makeup at the El Rey Theatre. But Makeup was only one of many decadent dance parties of the time. \n“I loved the whole new-glam era in the '90s,” says Lavitt, who by that time had made a name for himself throwing his own parties, too. “Hollywood saw an explosion of so many different genres then. It was exciting. DJs/promoters like Joseph, Paul V. at Dragstrip 66, Bryan Rabin and Mike Messex with Club Cherry. ... Nightlife goes in waves and for me that was a good one with all the glitter and glamour.” \nIn many ways the glam revival wasn’t much of a stretch from the goth of his youth. Both scenes were dramatic in their own way, musically and aesthetically. Lavitt was in his element with these late '90s parties, but he sought new inspirations, too. Well, old ones, actually. He created Beat It, a popular '80s night, and joined forces with the gals from '60s soiree Café Bleu for the mega-mod affair Club Shout! — which, like Club Makeup, was able to sell out the El Rey every month. \n“Another one of my inspirations was the great late DJ Billy Limbo and his retro Club 1970's, which ran for 10 years,” says Lavitt. “There has always been a need for nostalgia at nightclubs. If you are 18 to 25, chances are you want to reminisce about your childhood as an adult.” \nFor Lavitt, Club 90s was obviously a natural progression. But he was a bit ahead of his time. It took a while for 90s to resonate in the clubs, but when it did, it really did. The irony of his and Perdew’s current success with a concept that covers the era when they were actually doing clubs hasn’t escaped either of them.
