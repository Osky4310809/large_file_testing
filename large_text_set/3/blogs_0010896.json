When he gives you advice, I have to understand and try to improve. \n“Not especially to score goals. But when I have the pass, to look forward, to try to make me improve. But also when we have the chance to score, we like to create chances and score. \n“It’s important. Sometimes it could make the difference for the team, for the game, and when we have the chances to score, we have to score.” \nIt made a big difference for Chelsea as Kante scored the only goal on Monday night to take the champions-elect to Wembley for a semi-final against Tottenham next month. \nAfter winning the Premier League in his first campaign in England last season, Kante is now on course to go even better.

In the cup it is more difficult, because if you miss your chance you go out. Difficult, but we are happy to play at the semi-finals. \n“We are going to fight for every competition, in the league and the cup. \n\"The next game in the league, we have to prepare very well this game. The cup is a target, we are going to play to win every game, we are going to play to win against Tottenham. \n“We have to win every game.
