That number might not sound that exciting, but old-school fans of the series are bound to get a kick out of what it contains. In addition to fixing a few issues, it adds a limited-time dungeon based on the first game â€“ complete with a retro visual filter, sounds, and more. You can also earn a Butcher pet for your character, and a new legendary gem. We show you how to get both in this quick video. \nThe dungeon has 16 main floors, as well as a few optional areas to explore. It took me a little over an hour to go through it with a fresh character, but I was taking my time. Before you're tempted to roll through it with your existing character, be warned: If you want the Butcher pet, you need to complete the area with a new hero. It's easy stuff on normal difficulty, so don't worry too much about it. \nTake a look at the video below to see some of the highlights, including where you need to go, some familiar bosses, and the ending cinematic. It's a lot of fun, and it's a great excuse to fire up the game again if you've put it down. And if it's been a long time since you last played, take a look at my feature to see what's changed since launch (in short, a lot).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T00:54:45.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
