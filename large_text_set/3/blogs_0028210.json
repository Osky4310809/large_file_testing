The front desk staff didn't acknowledge me as I stood there waiting to ask her a question about the wait time, and the waiting room was completely packed with the same people after an hour. By the time I was seen by the NP, she checked my vitals in 5 minutes for a physical and said I was complete without any further information. I had to ask her to give me some directions to what to do next. She then told me I can go to the front desk because I was complete with my appointment. The front desk then told me to go to the back to get my blood work while another patient was there sharing his patient information. Then I was told by the assistant to urinate in a tube (I have no idea how she expected me to urinate perfectly into a tube) and then sit behind her as she proceeded to talk to a different patient about his medical history in front of me in which I tried really hard to not listen to. I don't think that is appropriate for anyone to hear about someone else's health needs if they aren't a provider. Those spaces need to be barricaded off for patient privacy. I was not pleased with the patient care I received here. I have tried to like this place as it is my third time here, but I've given it enough chances in hoping it would improve. Less than 3 months ago by a Verified Patient Bedside Manner Wait Time The doctors are great, most of the staff friendly. Nice, clean environment. I was highly upset due to the fact that I had a 9am appointment, was first to arrive before the office was even open. Was also first to check in, yet was seen after serval other clients.
