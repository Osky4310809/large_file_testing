Pat Toomey, R-Pa., provided more reason for concern this week with his response to the forced resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. He seemed more concerned that the media found out Flynn lied about contacts with Russian officials than that the contacts occurred. \nWith little notice, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., announced he would hold a telephone town meeting at 2:05 p.m. today. \nToomey has come under fire for not holding in person, public constituent meetings. \nAround 12:30 p.m., he posted this on Facebook : \nPlease join me for my 48th telephone town hall today/Thursday at 2:05. Listen on your cell phone or computer and ask me a question online.
