SoundCloud user Tesher has delivered a perfect mash-up of Drake’s opening bars of “KMT” & XXXTENTACTION’s “Look At Men” where the 6 God’s flow sounds almost identical to incarcerated rapper X’s. Listeners have been comparing the Drizzy’s flow on the track since he performed it at an Amsterdam concert and snippets of the track emerged online .\nDrake confronted these accusations in his interview with DJ Semtex, “I listened and I’m like, okay, I see where people could draw this comparison off of the first two lines, whether it be cadence or the rhyme pattern or whatever. It’s crazy that people think that after all this time, after all I’ve been through, that I’m the type of person to go and take that and make it my own. I’m not stupid, I’m not a sh*tty person like that.” Make your own judgment on the undoubted similarities in the mash-up beneath.\n\nListen to the original track featuring London road rap artist Giggs below.\n\nWith More Life came a fresh batch of hilarious new memes focusing on the project.
