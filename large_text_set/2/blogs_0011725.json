PIA \nMANILA, Philippines —This month's celebration of the 31st anniversary of the 1986 People Power Revolution would be \"very simple and very quiet\" and would highlight the need to move forward towards nation-building, Malacañang said on Thursday. \nPresidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said the event would be simple because the emphasis has shifted from the celebration of the past to \"reflection on what can happen in the future.\" \n\"It's time to move on from just celebrating the past, remembering the past and to move on into the whole aspect of nation-building, to give it a more positive outlook and… give (it) a more positive understanding,\" Abella said at a press briefing. \n\"It's going to be a very simple and very quiet… Basically, the whole thrust is moving the nation forward from just looking back at what has happened in the past but moving forward to the future of the Philippines as everybody is encouraged to cooperate in nation-building,\" he added. \nThe theme of this year's celebration is \"A day of reflection: Celebrating People Power for nation-building.\" \nThe celebration comes three months after former president Ferdinand Marcos was buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani despite protests from Martial Law victims and human rights groups.   \nPresident Duterte had said Marcos, who was ousted during the 1986 revolt, deserved to be interred at the heroes' cemetery as a former president, commander-in-chief and war veteran. Will Duterte attend? \nLast Wednesday, former president Fidel Ramos said he was informed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea that the 31st anniversary of the People Power revolt on February 25 would be smaller and would be held inside Camp Aguinaldo, not at the People Power Monument. Medialdea is the head of the organizing committee of the EDSA revolt anniversary. \nRamos, a former military chief who supported the revolt that toppled the Marcos regime, said Camp Aguinaldo was chosen as the venue to avoid traffic jam. \n\"They transferred the celebration. It seems that that it would be small. It will be inside Camp Aguinaldo to avoid traffic jam,\" the former president said in Filipino during the launching of his book \"FVR XYZ Files.\" \nAbella could not say if Duterte would attend the EDSA revolution anniversary rites. \n\"Hopefully, if it's done within the grounds and I think they're having some simple rites in Malacañang. I think there's a planned mass or something like that,\" he said. \nAsked if Duterte is expected to show up during the event, Abella replied: \"Well, I suppose so … I haven't heard anything to the contrary.\" \nPressed if Duterte's decision to allow the burial of Marcos at the heroes' cemetery would keep him away from the celebration, Abella said: \"Like I said, we move forward and not look back to the past.\" \nRamos also urged Malacañang to build an EDSA Learning Center at the back of the People Power Monument by next year but Abella said the proposal has yet to be discussed. \nLast year's EDSA anniversary rites featured the traditional salubungan, a reenactment of the unity between soldiers and civilians that led to the ouster of Marcos. \nChildren of EDSA heroes and youth leaders also joined the salubungan to affirm their commitment to keep the ideals and spirit of the revolt alive. \nA People Power Experiential Museum that combines elements of theater, cinema, photography, performances, installations, and other allied arts was also set up inside Camp Aguinaldo to educate the youth about martial law.
