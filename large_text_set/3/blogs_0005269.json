Back in 1991, Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson had the honor of singing the title track from the animated hit Beauty and the Beast , and now, 26 years later, Ariana Grande and John Legend are the voices tasked with the song for this year's live-action film starring Emma Watson . But don't fret, Dion will still play a large part in the upcoming production: she will be singing an original song for the soundtrack, \"How Does a Moment Last Forever,\" written by Alan Menken (the Disney mastermind behind the original movie) and Tim Rice. While we wait for that song to be available, take a look at what we already have and stay tuned for more fun news about the movie's soundtrack!
