But the leafy green may one day play a new role in keeping your ticker running. \nResearchers at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute have grown beating human heart cells on spinach leaves. \n“When I looked at the spinach leaf, its stem reminded me of an aorta,” WPI graduate student Joshua Gershlak said in a statement , comparing the veiny vegetable to the main artery in the human body. “I thought, let’s perfuse right through the stem.” \nSo, the WPI team—Glenn Gaudette, professor of biomedical engineering; Tanja Dominko, associate professor of biology and biotechnology; Pamela Weathers, professor of biology and biotechnology; Marsha Rolle, associate professor of biomedical engineering; and Gershlak— got to work . \nAfter stripping spinach leaves of their plant cells (the green bits), what’s left is a translucent framework of cellulose—a natural, harmless substance used in regenerative medicine (cartilage and bone tissue engineering, wound healing).\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute\nUsing the magic of science too complicated for me to explain, the researchers created a system that uses multiple spinach leaves to grow layers of healthy heart muscles to treat cardiac arrest patients. \n“We weren’t sure it would work, but it turned out to be pretty easy and replicable,” Gershlak said. “It’s working in many other plants,” including parsley, Artemesia annua (sweet wormwood), and peanut hairy roots. \nDifferent plant species could be adapted for different uses, according to WPI’s research paper. Spinach appears well-suited for cardiac tissue. But jewelweed may work as an arterial graft, while wood could be useful in bone engineering. \n“We have a lot more work to do, but so far this is very promising,” Gaudette said. “Adapting abundant plants that farmers have been cultivating for thousands of years for use in tissue engineering could solve a host of problems limiting the field.” \nThe Worcester Polytechnic Institute’s work is not complete, though: Researchers will continue studying the decellularization process and aim to build a secondary vascular network for the discharge of blood and fluids from human tissue. \nGershlak & Co. are set to present their technology and early results at the National Academy of Inventors inaugural Student Innovation Showcase in Boston next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T12:02:41.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
