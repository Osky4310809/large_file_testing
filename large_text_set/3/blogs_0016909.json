According to Xiaomi, its Redmi Note 4 that has been on sale since January this year online is now available at brick and mortar stores, expanding the company’s offline presence in India.\nFor now, the smartphone is available in stores only in a limited number of cities. But this has led to rise in the price tags. The base model that retails for Rs 9,999 online is now priced at Rs 11,499.\nFor now it will be available across 700 large retail stores in select cities and about 1,500 smaller retail stores.\nThe move will indeed bring some relief for fans and new comers who have been trying to get their hands on the recently announced Redmi Note 4 despite repeated flash sales. It usually takes just a few seconds, before the shutter closes down with many customers either choosing to wait, or others heading to stores to look for alternatives from brands like Vivo, Huawei and more.\n\nIndeed, Xiaomi spotted the opportunity, (although it is a bit late) but by now it is pretty sure that its Redmi Note 4 is a good all-rounder, meaning that it will not need to check the scales of demand versus supply.\nThe Chinese smartphone maker recently announced that it had achieved record sales of its Redmi Note 4 by selling 1 million units of the Redmi Note 4 in just 45 days.\nThe post Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 now officially available in stores from Rs 11,499 appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T10:15:26.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
