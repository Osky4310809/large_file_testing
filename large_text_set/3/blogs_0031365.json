Brexit: David Davis unveils great repeal bill white paper - Politics live Read more \nAccording to a leaked copy of his statement to MPs, obtained by the Guardian, Davis will tell MPs that as well as transposing aspects of EU legislation into UK law, the bill, which will be tabled later this year, will create a new power to “correct the statute book”. \n“Once EU law has been converted into domestic law, parliament will be able to pass legislation to amend, repeal or improve any piece of EU law it chooses – as will the devolved legislatures, where they have power to do so,” he is expected to say. \n“However, further steps will be needed to provide a smooth and orderly exit. This is because a large number of laws – both existing domestic laws and those we convert into UK law – will not work properly if we leave the EU without taking further action. Some laws, for example, grant functions to an EU institution with which the UK might no longer have a relationship. \n“To overcome this, the great repeal bill will provide a power to correct the statute book where necessary to resolve the problems which will occur as a consequence of leaving the EU”. \nHe will pledge that the new powers will be temporary; and will be aimed at ensuring a smooth and orderly transition as the UK leaves the EU – but they are likely to be regarded as a power-grab by some MPs, as they will allow changes to be made with less parliamentary scrutiny. \n“I can confirm this power will be time-limited. And parliament will need to be satisfied that the procedures in the bill for making and approving the secondary legislation are appropriate.” \n“Given the scale of the changes that will be necessary and the finite amount of time available to make them, there is a balance to be struck between the importance of scrutiny and correcting the statute book in time. \n“As the constitution committee in the other place recently put it, ‘...the challenge parliament will face is in balancing the need for speed, and thus for governmental discretion, with the need for proper parliamentary control of the content of the UK’s statute book.’“ \nThe government will also bring European court of justice case law, as it stands on the date we leave the EU, into UK law, giving it the same status as judgments of the UK supreme court. \nTo “maximise certainty” for businesses and others, the bill would keep case law as it stood on the day of exit, will say. “This approach maximises legal certainty at the point of departure. But our intention is not to fossilise the past decisions of the CJEU for ever,” he said, using the official EU acronym for the court. \n“As such, we propose that the bill will provide that historic CJEU case law be given the same status in our courts as decisions of our own supreme court.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T14:06:02.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
