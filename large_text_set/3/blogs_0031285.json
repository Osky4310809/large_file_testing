Kile 7:00 AM PDT, March 29, 2017 Playing EXCLUSIVE: Adrian Chase Gives Oliver an Ultimatum in Chilling 'Arrow' Sneak Peek: 'There's Nothing You Can Do' Oliver Queen may have escaped Prometheus’ torture chamber, but the villain’s punishments are far from over. In ET’s exclusive sneak peek at Wednesday’s Arrow , titled \"Disbanded,\" Prometheus’ plainclothes alter ego, Star City District Attorney Adrian Chase ( Josh Segarra ), pays Oliver ( Stephen Amell ) a visit at City Hall, placing a knife on his desk. “What are you doing?” Oliver asks. “Proving a point,” Chase explains, “so to speak.” RELATED: 'Arrow' Star and EP Dish on the Shocking Prometheus Reveal and 'Psychological Torture' to Come for Oliver The point, it becomes clear to Oliver, is really more of a dare. “You’re an animal who enjoys murder, there’s no telling what you’ll do,” Chase explains. “And it’s not like your alter ego can kill me, not since the SCPD put me in the protective custody since the Green Arrow slaughtered my wife.” “So you kill me in broad daylight,” the villain challenges, “or you let me live, knowing that there’s nothing you can do.” See how the chilling moment plays out in the video above!

Segarra spoke to reporters via conference call earlier this month, where he warned that Prometheus’ revenge mission against Oliver and the Green Arrow is only getting started. “Now, you’re going to get to see it turn,” the actor said of the season five villain’s unmasking. “This whole time, I’ve been waiting to pop that top off… You’re gonna see Chase just kind of trying to burn the world around him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T18:39:54.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
