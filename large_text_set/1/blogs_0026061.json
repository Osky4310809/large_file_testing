Members of the international media, who were reporting on these clamorous protests, were left reeling in bewilderment when they realized that these protestors were not fighting for the usual fare — equality, religion or saving the planet — but for their right to participate in Jallikattu, a traditional sport that requires men to run behind a bull and hang onto its hump.\nAs luck would have it, I managed to land in Coimbatore on a work assignment right in the midst of the protests. The streets were deserted and all the stores and restaurants shut, so I was rather grateful that the supplier I had come to meet took some time off from the protests to meet me at his factory so we could finalise our deal.\nSipping on some filter coffee in his office, I asked our supplier about Jallikattu and he declared, ‘Even Stalin demanded permanent removal of the ban.’\nRather confused I asked, ‘Err…I thought Stalin was only interested in communism and all that. Nice to know he had an interest in bull-fighting as well.’ The supplier glared at me, ‘Not that Lenin-wala Stalin, this is our own Stalin!’\nMy assistant who had been rather quiet all this time suddenly interjected, ‘I want to see this Stalin, what a name, it brings to mind a big black horse running wild.’\nThe supplier gritted his teeth and said, ‘That is a stallion! This is DMK party’s working president, M K Stalin who is leading the Jallikattu protests, he is trying to save our culture, you understand?’\nI hastily tried to appease him, ‘Yes sir, your culture is truly the best, everyone wants to copy it. Even McDonald’s has a new offering, the masala dosa burger, super really!’\nThat evening as we wrapped up work and headed to the airport, we encountered a large convoy of bikes filled with placard-carrying protestors and cars with rear windshields sporting posters of jewellery-laden bulls.\nWith our car stuck behind this slow procession, my assistant began waving and taking pictures of the now smiling protestors while I began brushing up my JQ.\nI soon discovered that reasons cited by the pro-Jallikattu brigade ranged from protecting indigenous species of bulls to the fact that the sport was an essential part of Tamil tradition and cultural identity. As proof, they pointed to seals of the Indus Valley civilisation which depict the sport and references to hugging the bull in classical literature from the Sangam period.\nI continued reading and found that prominent citizens like Rajinikanth, Kamal Hassan, AR Rahman, spiritual leaders and various politicians have stood up to protect something they believe is part of their ancient culture, and I begin to wonder why stalwarts all over India, including these Tamil champions, can’t do the same for something that impacts millions of lives as well? Why if Tamil Nadu’s successful agitators can get an ordinance allowing Jallikatu passed, can’t we bulldoze the government into changing other unfair legislations? Why don’t we show solidarity for another group that needs to be protected, and which is also part of our ancient history and culture?\nThey too are depicted in ancient sculptures and mythology, from 10th century Khajuraho temple with erotic depictions of women embracing women and men showing each other their genitals to the Sushruta Samhita, a Hindu medical text dating back to at least 600 BC that mentions homosexuality and states that men who behave like women, or women who behave like men, are determined as such at the time of their conception in the womb. Our mythology is also filled with myriad references to fluidity of genders. There is Ardhanarishvara, the androgynous combination of Shiva and his consort Parvati who is split down the middle as half man half woman. Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is a composite androgynous form of Vishnu and Lakshmi and the wondrous Mohini, not the one dancing to ‘Ek Do Teen’ portrayed by Madhuri Dixit but the one Lord Vishnu transforms time and again, though in the Tamil versions of the Mahabharata, it is Lord Krishna who takes the form of Mohini and marries Aravan for one night.\nThere are more than 2.5 million of our own indigenous species who need protecting, who need the might of strident protestors, who wish that stalwarts of the community come out to support them, and that ministers who work frantically to save archaic traditions wake up to the need for legislation that allows same-sex couples to live and love like everyone else.\nI wonder what must be going through the minds of these marginalised millions when they see that taming bulls wins over grabbing Section 377 by its horns.\nOur car eventually reaches the airport and as I walk in, my phone pings with a message from my 72-year-old Pintu uncle who fills his time by making up jokes and then spams my inbox with the same. I click on his latest offering and it states: A man was getting the bull ready to take part in Jallikattu and the bull said, ‘Aiyo! You people dislike me so much that you have worked day and night just to have the right to bully me?’ The man replied, ‘No! We have no beef with you, it was our Tamil pride at steak!’\nI type back, ‘Good one uncle, I guess this time you have really hit the bull’s-eye.’ And I walk towards the gate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T09:27:33.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
