Perhaps making history with the first back-to-back #1 albums ever helped him land a Billboard cover story . \nIn the feature, the Atlanta star shares his journey from the Dungeon Family days to touring with Drake, selling out arenas across the country. \nFor all of his popularity, Future has yet to be nominated for a Grammy, something that Kanye West has mourned , but Future doesn’t seem to mind. \n“The Grammys, they get what they get — the shit that they don’t, it’s the shit that they maybe don’t want to understand,” he says. “They’re not going to keep me from doing what I’m supposed to do as an artist.” \nHe also discusses his role as a father and says he enjoys being a provider for his five children. While he seems hesitant to give a clear answer on how he feels about reaching a conclusion with Ciara — earlier this year, the two settled their custody battle and she called off her $15 million defamation lawsuit — Future Hendrix expresses confidence in where he’s at in life. \n“I feel like everything happened for a reason,” he says. “I’m happy with life now. I’m happy with life, period, even with the end of a ­relationship … I’m just not going to settle for anything, you know? Even in my life now, I know I can be a better person. I ain’t giving up on myself, so if you give up on me, I ain’t got nothing else to say for you. Because if you give up on ­something that’s real, it wasn’t real to you.” \nAnd Ciara isn’t the only woman Future’s made headlines with. He’s been rumored to be cozy with Scotty Pippen’s wife and reveals that there’s much more to his love life than what the public knows. \n“What the people don’t ­understand is, I been kicking it with superstars when it comes to females for a minute — on the low-low with nobody don’t know-know,” he shares. \nRead the full interview at Billboard and see Future’s cover below.
