I've learned that mascara isn't something you have to splurge on. I've learned that you never want to mix retinol and alpha hydroxy acids . And I've learned that the no celebrity ever walks a red carpet without fake lashes. Until now. While mascara-free looks are all the rage on the runways , it's unheard of at an awards show, which is what makes Lea Michele's makeup for the Grammys 2017 so exceptional. Not only is the actress not wearing fake lashes, she's not wearing any mascara, or liner, her makeup artist Mélanie Inglessis told Allure tonight. Picking up the rose gold tones of the beading in her Roberto Cavalli dress, Inglessis wanted to do something a little different from the earth-toned smoky eyes we're used to seeing on Michele. \"We went with a rose gold, purple-y, burgundy shadow, a peachy lip, and bronzed and highlighted skin,\" said Inglessis, who combined a mix or cream and powder shadows on the eyes. She started with a layer of shimmery peach cream shadow—Chanel Illusion D'ombre Long Wear Luminous Eyeshadow in Émerveillé—all over the lids. She then pressed the pink shade in the Chanel Quadra Eyeshadow in Tissé Cambon on top of the peach, and used the dark purple shade in the palette to define the creases. A bit of lip balm on top enhanced the shine and made sure the glimmery shade would really catch the light.

The notion of going mascara-free took some convincing. \"She wasn't sold at first, but we've worked together for so long that she trusts me.\" And we're glad she did. With the pink eye shadow trend so popular on both the runways and red carpet , it's nice to see another way to wear the look.
