By using AT&T’s IoT network and the IBM Watson Data Platform, AT&T’s IoT analytics solutions will ingest data from hundreds of wells, creating the models necessary with appropriate machine learning libraries and open source technology to help predict potential failures or machine malfunctions. The company will be able to detect anomalies in less time and with greater accuracy. \n“We have more than 30 million connections on our network today and that number continues to grow, primarily driven by enterprise adoption,” said Chris Penrose, president of IoT solutions at AT&T. “Integrating the IBM Watson Data Platform into our IoT capabilities will be huge for our enterprise customers.” Bringing IoT innovations to market \nThe news today builds on existing collaborations between AT&T and IBM to deliver new IoT innovations to the market. The companies’ strategic alliance brings together leading wireless connectivity, advanced analytics and cognitive capabilities for AT&T’s enterprise customers to improve their business processes. \nStay tuned for further announcements live from IBM InterConnect. \nA version of this article originally appeared on the IBM Internet of Things blog .
