It wasn’t clear if the reference was bluster or indicated an imminent threat. \nThe suspects – three men from Kosovo and an unidentified minor – were also reportedly overheard praising the terror attack in London last week and discussing a desire to join jihadis in Syria . \nThe group had been under surveillance for more than a year. A police statement said they were detained in an overnight sweep after it was established that they had undergone “religious radicalisation”. \nThe Rialto is the oldest of four bridges that span Venice’s Grand Canal, first built at the end of the 12th century. \nThe current bridge, an arched stone construction that dates from the late 16th century, is one of Venice’s best-known landmarks. Venice prosecutor Adelchi d’Ippolito told reporters that the comment about blowing it up “was one the most worrying and alarming remarks we heard” on the intercept. \nD’Ippolito said the suspects appeared to have been studying how to make explosives, but did not have the necessary components for constructing a bomb. \n“There was [also] a lot of talk about unconditional support [for] Isis . It wasn’t just theory and dogma,” D’Ippolito added, referring to the intercepted conversations. \nTwelve raids were carried out overnight in the city’s historic centre, and one each in the nearby town of Mestre and the Veneto city of Treviso. \nInterior minister Marco Minniti praised Italy’s anti-terror squad, Digos, for “its important achievement in the prevention of terror”. \nItaly has deported 21 terror suspects since the beginning of this year, and a total of 153 since January 2015, when the country ramped up security in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. Security was tightened again after the London attack on 22 March. \nEarlier this month, authorities deported a Tunisian man allegedly linked to Anis Amri, who killed 12 people after driving a truck into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market in December. Amri was shot dead by Italian police during a routine check in Milan days after.
