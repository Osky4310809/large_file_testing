The dogs, some of which are bred for consumption with others are captured homeless dogs or even stolen pets, live a miserable existence in farms that closely mirror the horrific existence animals experience in factory farms. Dogs spend their lives trapped in small, barren wire cages, without any access to proper care or even the most basic needs. \nLearning about the cruel dog meat trade is distressing, but there is comfort to be found in many compassionate people who working to raise awareness and bring an end to this trade. Humane Society International’s Animal Rescue Team is in the midst of shutting down a number of dog meat farms. The Animal Rescue Team recently just landed in South Korea and is currently working to remove 200 animals and shut down a farm. In this particularly touching photo from the rescue, one of the dogs is finally feeling a loving human embrace. He is now safe and will soon experience freedom. \n\n\nNow that the dogs are safe at the hands of the Humane Society International, they will be flown to rescues and shelters in the U.S. and Canada, where they will be re-homed and given a life full of love and compassion – exactly what they deserve. \nHow can you help? First and foremost, educate yourself and others about the dangers associated with eating dog meat is critical to bringing an end to this practice. Humane Society International has a wealth of information and resources to help and they also run large campaigns encouraging country leaders to take action to ban the trade altogether. Many people are not aware of the cruel practices and dangers or even the existence of the dog meat trade, so your best course of action is to educate yourself and others to expose the truth of this industry – share this article to get started! \nIt’s also important to recognize that these dogs, who want to live a happy and free life, are no different than the pigs and cows that we raise for meat here in the U.S. If we could all see the animals around us as complex, emotional beings , instead of mindless commodities, the world would be a much kinder place. \nWith your help, we can shut down the dog meat trade for good. Please consider making a donation to Humane Society International so that they can continue their life-saving work. Your donation will directly pay for the dispatch of our rescue team, lifesaving veterinary care for the rescued dogs, food, cages for transport. \nImage Source: Humane Society International /Facebook Want to read more posts like this?
