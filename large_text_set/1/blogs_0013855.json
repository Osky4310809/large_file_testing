He got hit, and several days later, he was blind in one eye,” said Carol Saile, who fell in love with a writer deft handling either a pool stick or a tough story. “Bob was the boy who started mothers saying: ‘Put that thing down, you could put somebody’s eye out.’ ” \nBut man, oh man, did Saile see some stuff during his time roaming this earth, from dark taverns choked with cigar smoke to crystal clear Rocky Mountain vistas like John Denver used to sing about. \nDespite wrestling most of his life with the chronic pain of spinal arthritis, Saile laughed on a bar stool next to astronaut Wally Schirra, talked civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr. and raised three kids. Colorado ranchers and government bureaucrats alike got nothing except straight talk from Saile. In his mind, feisty conservative and staunch environmentalist need not be mutually exclusive. Born at the tail end of the Great Depression to an engineer on the Hoover Dam, Saile grew into an activist who shouted down construction of the Two Forks Dam in order to keep the South Platte River running wild and free. \nWhether raising his voice to call a turkey in the field or call attention to the dangers of whirling disease, it’s the passion that rang true. Saile was always thirsty for more. He liked to tell a story of stopping for a burger in rural Colorado, and asking the waitress where a fisherman could buy some alcohol. \n“You want whiskey?” the waitress replied. “That’s the Road to Ruin.” \nSaile flinched, expecting to get nailed by a teetotaler’s sermon. \n“No,” the waitress sweetly explained. “It’s just two blocks down the street, on the left. The name of the liquor store is The Road to Ruin.” \nSaile often wore a beat-up cowboy hat, the perfect cover for being sneaky funny and stealthy smart. He understood a mentor could be any old Texas A&M Aggie with a little knowledge and a heart big enough to share it. What did Saile teach me? Well, it was really no different from the encouragement he gladly offered to countless other Coloradans: \nIn this state, there’s no bad road to take. Around the next corner, there’s probably something beautiful, and even if the big fish gets away, it’s a great day, because we are blessed to live here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:11:26.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
