Or, preferably, ignored him. \nThat they gave his tawdry stunt the oxygen of publicity by ‘investigating’ it sums them up. Clueless at times. \nLook into the issue of football and gambling by all means, while all the time having a bookmaking partner of your own of course, but this was just a stupid stunt. \nAnyone with the merest smidgeon of betting knowledge knows this was nothing to do with dodgy gambling, this was no type of coup. It was just a gimmick. End of story.

My guess is that the five-figure sum was £125.75p. Tops. \nThe chances of anyone making any shady money out of Shaw’s pie-eating were slimmer than Arsene Wenger , in the adjacent dugout, tucking into a meat and potato while trying to do up his zip. \nThere is a reason every bookie smokes a fat cigar - and it’s not taking lumps of money on a man eating food. \nBut talking of Wenger, it was a good moment for the FA to bury bad news. Wenger on the sidelines at Sutton (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane) \nAt a similar time as the FA’s investigation into Shaw’s prattish antics was announced, the written reasons for Wenger’s pathetic four-match technical area ban were being released. \nHe had told match officials to ‘**** off’, accused one of being ‘dishonest’ and shoved the same person. Twice. \nIf the FA were serious about getting really tough with managers’ misbehaviour, they would have appealed the independent commission’s verdict on Wenger. But they didn’t. \nIs there a more heinous thing than a manager to do than to accuse an official of being ‘dishonest’? Taking a bite out of a savoury snack, maybe. Wenger is sent to the stands by Jon Moss (Photo: Shaun Botterill) Arsene Wenger clashes with fourth official Anthony Taylor (Photo: REUTERS) \nWenger and his lawyers managed to weasel their way out of a stadium suspension by, among other things, apologising, citing the misdemeanours of other managers and saying the shoves were the instinctive reaction of feeling his personal space was being invaded. Shameful, just shameful. \nRepeat. He accused an official of being dishonest. \nWenger questioned the integrity of a man who earns less in a year than he does in a week. And the FA were happy with a punishment that saw him sit in the posh seats for a few games and shell out short change.
