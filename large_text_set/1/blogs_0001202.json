If it is voluntary as it ought to be, why should it be billed at all in the first place? Why should the consumer be embarrassed in full public view to grovel before the billing clerk and explain to him whether she was satisfied with the services or not and how much of the service charges billed she considers reasonable? Representational image. Reuters \n• Second, a sizeable percentage of customers would prefer to swallow the service charges as part of the bill instead of facing the embarrassment of confronting the billing clerk with fellow diners’ gaze falling on them. They may rationalize that it is perhaps the done thing to comply though your heart says you must not; \n• The time lost in this rigmarole would be considerable. A consumer is often in a mood to leave immediately after a leisurely meal. Arguing before the billing clerk might take five to ten minutes. And if the consumer has been successful, she would be asked to wait till a fresh bill is raised and printed because tinkering with the first bill might arouse the suspicion of both the management and the service tax department; \n• Fourth, displaying conspicuously the law that service charges are voluntary and that it is contingent upon services being found satisfactory is a farce. If displayed at the entrance, it would be the most embarrassing welcome a restaurant can extend to its customers and if displayed on the table, it might put an end to the appetite of the hungry family! Displaying the information that the staff in the restaurant is mandated to wash their hands after each visit to the washroom is confidence building whereas the display of the law on tips may well end up dispiriting the consumers. \nIn any case, when something is voluntary and not mandatory, there is no way it can be billed. What the department of consumer affairs ought to have done is to declare the practice illegal, liable to a severe penalty under the consumer protection law. also see", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:34:16.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
