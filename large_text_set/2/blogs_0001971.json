If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nOddly enough, Trump’s tweet came shortly after a Fox News commentary segment early Thursday morning suggested pulled the public university should lose funding over the protests, which wouldn’t be the first time the timing suggested Trump was live-tweeting his morning Fox News viewing. \nProtests over Yiannopoulos’ appearance–which have been a frequent occurrence as the conservative troll tours college campuses –turned chaotic at Berkeley as protesters shot off fireworks, broke windows, and set fires before the event was cancelled.
