Islam.\nI know that disturbs you because chances are you live in a world where cultural relativism prevails and all religions - fusty old things that they are - are equal.\nWell, it is so if you think so, but I will note again that at least one interested party - the current president of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi - has declared bluntly that his religion is in dire need of a reformation. Chances are he knows more about Islam than you. He certainly does than me. Also, he lives in a hellacious region of the world dominated by that religion and its violent ideology.\nHow dangerous is that ideology? Ask yourself this: Why is it that since 9/11/2001 there he have been 30,209 terror attacks in the name of Allah? There have been 38 in the last six days alone , resulting in 425 killed and 419 injured. There were also 9 suicide bombings during that time frame.\nSo I repeat, why is that? DNA? That would be racist. Poverty? But most of the terror masters are rich. How about an ideology that urges you to do these things, just as it always has since the Seventh Century? Could that be the reason - just possibly?\nIf so, do you have some idea of what to do about that ideology or do you prefer to blame Donald Trump because he is trying to do something about it, at least trying to makes sure his own citizens are protected?\nI know. Sorry I asked. Blame Donald Trump. He was the one who blew all those people in San Bernardino to smithereens and then walked into that Orlando gay bar and wiped out everyone there as if they were digital images in some real life video game.\nBetter to protest at JFK or wherever they are perpetuating this horrifyingly racist and unAmerican order the orangeman has perpetrated on the innocent of the Third World. Give me your tired, your poor, Nancy Pelosi intones from the exclusive terroir of her Napa Valley vineyard. It's a desecration of the Holocaust, says Jerrold Nadler, unknowingly desecrating the Holocaust himself by making such an absurd comparison.\nNo, ladies and gentleman, pretend though it's otherwise, we do have an Islam problem, all of us. Europe as we knew it growing up is practically gone and our society has been badly infected. When a massive march of American women is led by a Muslim woman who insists she wants to \"take the vagina away\" of one of the great freedom fighters of our time, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who herself has suffered from genital mutilation, we know things have come to a drastic pass.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2017/01/28/my-islam-problem-and-yours/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.dailywire.com/news/12852/muslim-womens-march-organizer-attacks-female-hank-berrien"], "published": "2017-01-29T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T09:25:07.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
