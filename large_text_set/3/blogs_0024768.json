Here’s how to set it up. Advertisement \nTo enable it, tap the Me icon, then Options (the gear icon), then look for Two-Factor Authentication. When you enable it, Instagram sends a security code to your phone number. If you never added a phone number, you can do so under Options > Edit Profile. Once two-factor authentication is on, any time you log in from a new device a code is sent to your phone before you can log in. You’ll also get a bunch of backup codes in case you lose access to your phone, so be sure to save those some place safe. \nTwo-factor authentication is one of the simplest ways to secure your accounts and since getting your social media accounts hacked is generally an embarrassing endeavor , it’s an easy way to help lock those accounts up.
