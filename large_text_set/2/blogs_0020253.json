Here’s why a “favorite things” theme is the perfect choice. Advertisement \nA favorite things party is pretty much what it sounds like — each guests brings one or two things they’re really into at the moment. This could range from a new beer they’ve fallen in love with to their go-to brand for comfy socks. Customize this theme to fit your party, here are some options. Conversation Starter : Guests simply tell others about a recent great find, whether that’s extra comfy socks or a delicious new restaurant. This gets conversation going since everyone knows that other guests should have a favorite thing in mind, so they have an easy opener. Guessing Game : Have each guest send you their favorite thing before the party or ask each guest to write it down as they arrive. Then, post each guest’s entry or read them out loud and have others guess which entry belongs to which guest. Gift Exchange : Ask each person to bring a sample of their favorite thing and do a gift exchange. This variation may be more suitable for birthday or holiday parties, which normally involve gifts. It also limits what kind of favorite things people can bring, since it’s tough to gift a whole restaurant or a weekend trip to a nearby town. \nThis might seem a little silly, but it gives everyone something to look forward to and makes your get together more memorable.
