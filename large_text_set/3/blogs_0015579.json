The Computer Science graduate of Bingham University was last seen on Monday last week at his aunty’s residence where he was living before his corpse was found on Friday at Akpata, an area known for illicit activities and drug peddling. Northern City News gathered that Daloba, who was serving with the Industrial Training Fund, had not been going home since Monday after closing from work at the ITF. It was learnt that the Taraba State indigene had been quiet and aloof before the incident prompting family members to suspect that he was facing some emotional challenges. The Public Relations Officer, National Youth Service Corps headquarters, Mrs. Bose Aderibigbe, confirmed the death of Daloba, saying the police were investigating the incident. “What we learnt was that he had not been going home since last week Monday. The body was found at Akpata and his next-of-kin has been contacted; the police have commenced investigation into the sad and unfortunate incident,” she stated. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
