This after Olivia directs Quinn ( Katie Lowes ) to head to the charred remains of Jennifer’s cabin for any and all evidence she can find before the FBI shuts down the investigation into Jennifer’s death. \n“We can do this, Mellie. Do not despair,” Olivia tries to comfort Mellie as she power-walks her way through Olivia Pope & Associates. “Where are you anyway?” “White House,” answers Mellie, seemingly more dejected than usual. “Fitz says Teddy’s been asking for me, so motherhood.” What’s Olivia’s fix? Wine. All the wine. “We’ll drink later.” \nRELATED: Kerry Washington Opens Up About Filming 'Scandal' While Pregnant With Her Son In January, Washington spoke to ET at the Television Critics Association winter press tour where she and Young were promoting the new season of Scandal.
