One quick switch and he goes from his Mac to his PC. Here are some more photos. Advertisement \nThe wide IKEA desk is a nice touch, especially since it has enough space under there to get comfortable while simultaneously giving him enough room to keep both computers and his headphones (two, one for each computer) under there. He also gets enough desk surface for his displays, speakers, and two sets of keyboards, which I can dig (sure, Synergy is a thing, but sometimes you just like having options!) Here’s a shot straight on: \nJason also does some audio work, and you can check out some of the gear he uses—and some nice guitars—in this shot below: \nBut of course, the space serves multiple purposes, so in addition to the work—and presumably play—those computers help him out with, and the music he makes with the audio gear, it’s also a studio, which you can see in action here: \nIt’s a great space, and considering he crams so much gear into it and makes it functional earns our seal of approval. If you dig it too, head over to his Flickr page (linked below) and let him know how much you like it too.

Make sure any photos you include are at least 1280x720. Keeping them to 16:9 helps, too! Include a little text about the stuff you used, how you came up with the design, and any other relevant details. If your clever organization and good design sense catches our eye, you might be the next featured workspace!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:08:10.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
