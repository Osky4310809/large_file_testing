The Ibiza-bound flight took off from Glasgow Airport but had to be diverted to Toulouse, France \nMcKeown was disruptive before the aircraft even took off and interfered with the safety demonstration, but his boozy antics became worse after crew served him with a letter telling him how to behave, reports the Daily Record .

McKeown was already drunk ahead of the 7am flight and was chucked off the plane in France (Photo: Getty) \nAn off-duty female police officer then waded in to try to help. \nMcKeown shouted and swore at the cabin crew and repeatedly struck windows and overhead cabins before the officer managed to restrain him.

This was reprehensible behaviour.” \nThe sheriff fined McKeown £3,200, to be paid at a rate of £50 a week, and ordered him to stump up the £5,200 for Jet2 to cover the cost of the diversion. \nJet2 managing director Phil Ward said: “Mr McKeown’s actions caused inconvenience and distress for other customers as well as our crew. \n“We hope that he has learned an important lesson and that the consequences of his actions send out a strong message that this behaviour will not be tolerated.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:35:39.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
