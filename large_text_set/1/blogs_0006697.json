Keep calm and keep the secrets ! Beauxbatons Academy of Magic \" Thought to be situated somewhere in the Pyrenees, visitors speak of the breath-taking beauty of a chateau surrounded by formal gardens and lawns created out of the mountainous landscape by magic. \" —Description of the landscape around Beauxbaton [src] Beauxbatons Academy of Magic (French: Académie de Magie Beauxbâtons ) is the French wizarding school , located in the Pyrenees [1] in southern France. The school takes students from France, Belgium , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Portugal , and Spain . [1] The school coat of arms is two golden wands crossed over one another, each shooting three stars. [2] Contents Edit \nApart from the Flamels, famous ex-students of Beauxbatons include Vincent Duc de Trefle-Picques , who escaped the Terror by casting a concealment charm on his neck and pretending that his head had already been cut off; Luc Millefeuille , the infamous pastry-maker and Muggle-poisoner, and Fleur Delacour , who fought in the world-famous Battle of Hogwarts and was awarded medals of bravery from both the French and British Ministries of Magic. [1] Headmistress Olympe Maxime is (in spite of her protestations to the contrary) half-giantess; clever, elegant, and undeniably awe-inspiring. [1] \nBeauxbatons participated in the Triwizard Tournament that was held in 1792 and the tournament that was held in 1994 . During the 1792 tournament one of the tasks involved catching a cockatrice . However, the beast went on a rampage and injured three of the judges, one of the injured was at the time the head of Beauxbatons . In the 1994 tournament Fleur Delacour was selected school champion and finished in fourth place behind the other three contestants. During the 1994 tournament Olympe Maxime served as head of the academy. Castle and grounds Palace of Beauxbatons \nThe Palace of Beauxbatons is a beautiful chateau surrounded by majestic gardens and fountains magically created out of the surrounding mountains, and has stood for over seven hundred years [1] . In the Dining Hall, Wood Nymphs serenade the students while they eat, and at Christmas , the hall is adorned with great, glittering, non-melting ice sculptures. [3] \nIt is said that the stunning castle and grounds of this prestigious school were part-funded by alchemist gold, for Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel met at Beauxbatons in their youth, and a magnificent fountain in the middle of the school’s park, believed to have healing and beautifying properties, is named for them. [1] Traditions \nThe students at Beauxbatons Academy have been taught to stand at attention from when their Headmistress enters the room until she seats herself, showing great respect for her. Students take their Ordinary Wizarding Levels in their sixth year. [4] \nThe students wear pale blue robes made of fine silk. [2] Beauxbaton's carriage Students and staff are transported by use of the Beauxbatons carriages [5] (French: Le carrosse de Beauxbâtons ). [6] The carriages are a light-blue, pulled by a dozen winged horses . Despite being used as transportation by Beauxbatons, travelling in an Abraxan horse-drawn giant carriage is a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy . [7] The Abraxan horses are only fed single-malt whisky . Reputation Edit \nEducation at Beauxbatons Academy is of the same quality, if not higher, than the education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland . Beauxbatons students take their equivalent of Ordinary Wizarding Levels in their sixth year , rather than their fifth like their Hogwarts counterparts. Students who are of age were shown to be able to cast the Avis Charm wandlessly and nonverbally [8] . Rivalry with other schools Edit \nTypically, Beauxbatons Academy has enjoyed a very warm, cordial relation with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , the exception being during the Triwizard Tournament , where the two schools have enjoyed a healthy rivalry; Beauxbatons has won the Tournament sixty-two times and Hogwarts has won sixty-three. [1] \nIn the last of these tournaments from 1994-1995 , the Tournament was successfully reinstated. Their relation with Hogwarts in this tournament was strained slightly due to Lord Voldemort's servant placing Harry Potter 's name in the Goblet of Fire giving Hogwarts a second champion.
