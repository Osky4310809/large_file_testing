Health workers’ will go under special training to implement the programme in 100 districts at the beginning of the next financial year, sources told Indian Express. The programme will be integrated with one of referrals so that any early signs are treated to pre-empt what officials called “catastrophic health expenses” which many of these diseases entail. \nA report in medical journal Circulation claimed Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as the leading cause of mortality in India. “A quarter of all mortality is attributable to CVD. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are the predominant causes and are responsible for more than 80% of CVD deaths. The Global Burden of Disease study estimate of age-standardized CVD death rate of 272 per 100,000 population in India is higher than the global average of 235 per 100,000 population,” said the report. \nAlso Watch: \nIndia’s cancer burden has become a cause of concern.

While in 2013 the figure rose to 10,86,783, in 2014 it was 11,17,269, and in 2015 it stood at 11,48,692.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:06:20.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
