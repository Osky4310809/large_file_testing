We are very happy, everyone is happy at Chelsea at the moment,\" Courtois told reporters. \"If you are in first place with a seven point lead, it helps. It helps that you are winning, it helps in the way you're working and helps everybody accept the way of working. \n\"The mood is very good, everyone trains very hard during the week. When we win like Saturday, we get a free day on the Sunday and it is obviously a nice feeling. Diego didn't train since Tuesday and the manager had a plan in his head. \n\"We trained very well and we knew what to do. We played the same against Bournemouth as well. I don't think it [Diego's absence] is something that will effect us, but I think we did well again, with the guys up front. That's good for us.\" \nEden Hazard, Willian and Pedro played in the forward line in the absence of the club's top goal-scorer, with two goals coming from Marcos Alonso and another from Pedro as Chelsea's 3-0 win saw them move seven points clear at the top of the table.
