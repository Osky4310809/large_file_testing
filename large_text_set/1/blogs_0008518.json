We've confirmed it's the same headphone (confirmed with listening and measurements, which you'll see in the video), only now it's a lot more affordable. \n\nThe Sennheiser x Massdrop HD6XX lowers the price of entry into world-class headphones, starting today. \n\nThe \"drop\" page goes live at 10:00 a.m. PDT on Massdrop.com, and you can go there by clicking here , where you can request to be notified when drop is live. The Massdrop x Sennheiser HD 6XX Headphones will be available for $199.99 with free domestic shipping starting November 8th at 6:00AM PT. \nProducts mentioned in the video: Sennheiser HD 650 open, over-ear headphone G.R.A.S. 45BB-12 KEMAR with anthropometric pinna and low-noise ear simulators Sennheiser x Massdrop HD6XX Review / Preview produced by Joseph Cwik, Brian Murphy, and Jude Mansilla I've got a fever...and the only prescription is more CanJam! offline \nHere are frequency response and THD measurements we made of both the Sennheiser x Massdrop HD6XX and the Sennheiser HD650: \n\nNOTE: The measurements above reflect diffuse field correction. \nThey do sound the same, and those measurements certainly support that. \n\n\nThere's really not much to say this time around. It's just so obvious . But I'll throw in a few words anyway just so my post isn't purely pictures. Massdrop has carved out a niche in releasing their own versions of iconic headphones, with some unique properties and spectacular prices. First came the AKG K7XX - a ninja-black take on the K702 65th Anniversary Edition which had an MSRP of $499 just a few years back. Then came the Fostex TH-X00, a customized version of the classic Denon/Fostex woodies we all know and love. Denon's D5000 used to sell for $699 and the Fostex TH-900 was $1299 before they discontinued both models. The Massdrop version, not identical to either but certainly competitive with both, sold for $399 (and later $449 with an arguably fancier wood). You sense the theme here? Excellent headphones with some custom touches selling for prices far lower than expected - in some cases even lower than used prices on the original models themselves. There's also been a specialized CIEM collaboration with the Custom Art brand, an early exclusive with the AKG K553 Pro, and a specially commissioned DAC/amp called the Grace Design m9XX. Clearly Massdrop \"gets it\" on a level very few others do, to the benefit of the entire headphone community. Well, Massdrop is at it again, this time with the iconic Sennheiser HD650. One of the most loved and commonly owned \"high-end\" headphones ever, the HD650 needs no introduction. I used quotes for \"high-end\" since there are now so many more expensive models available that we sometimes forget how long the HD600 and HD650 were on top of the food chain. For several decades, if you wanted a high-end headphone without spending crazy-money on something like a Sony R10 or Audio Technica L3000.... your main choice was the HD600/HD650 duo, followed by the AKG K701, beyerdynamic DT880/990, Grado RS-1, and on down the line. But in my mind the Sennheiser duo was the first and most obvious path that most people followed. It's also interesting that the Sennheisers have experienced something of a resurgence lately. Lots of headphone enthusiasts I know, fed up with the latest and greatest models with their huge price tags, have gone back to using HD600 or HD650 as their primary headphone. HD800 and HD800S may be the \"better\" headphones in some respects but a lot of folks still enjoy the 6-series more when it comes to real-world listening. And I totally get it - the 6-series does so much right, and perhaps more importantly, so little wrong, that it still makes for an easy recommendation after all these years. That recommendation is about to get easier thanks to the new Massdrop Sennheiser HD6XX. They start with an HD650 - made in Ireland just like the regular version - add a sweet new stealth paint scheme, a redone cable, and some other minor aesthetic touches, and price the whole thing for just $199. Yes, $199. That's an insane value right there! I've (happily) paid more for used HD650 examples on more than one occasion. To put that in perspective, the original HD650 MSRP is still $499, with street prices at most places being $399, and deals coming around here and there for the low-$300 range. So $199 for this unique version is an absolute steal in my book. The HD6XX paint scheme is called Pantone Black 6 XGC, but it's actually more like a very deep midnight blue. It seems nearly indistinguishable from black until you look in the proper lighting. The HD650 logos on the sides, normally silver with darker gray lettering, are now black with silver text. The \"Sennheiser\" text across the top of the headband is black instead of white, making it very subtle in contrast to the midnight blue. There's a Massdrop logo on the inside of the headband above the right cup, and on the other side will be the serial number. This initial batch is limited to 5,000 units, so don't miss out. I imagine there will be more down the road but it will be a while. The first 500 orders placed will be guaranteed a serial in the sub-550 range, in case that matters to you. Not sure if it becomes randomized after that or not. The redone cable is pretty much the same cable as before but chopped into a shorter, more manageable length, and terminated with a 1/8\" plug. These aspects make it more useful in day to day listening as far as I'm concerned, and you can always add the (included) adapter for 1/4\" use if needed. Or grab a cable extension for across-the-room listening if that ends up being something you do. Massdrop says there will be an option for a balanced ZY branded cable at additional cost when checking out. I don't have the price available but that could be useful if it ends up being a good deal. Or, visit any one of the many companies out there who make HD650 cables. Moon Audio, Toxic Cables, Effect Audio, Signal Cable, Cardas, Norse, C3, WyWires, ... the list is massive. I've been hearing a lot about Impact Audio and their very affordable cables lately so that's something to look into as long as we're talking about great value. But, as stock cables go, this one is not stiff or annoying like some others, so most people will be fine with it. And that pretty much covers it - a nicely customized HD650 with an extremely welcome price. What more could we ask for? The parts are all replaceable and interchangeable with HD650/HD600 parts, so this is an investment which should last a lifetime of heavy use. Sennheiser even covers it with a 2 years warranty which I assume applies to the original buyer. As usual for Massdrop, orders are placed now, with payment collected after the drop ends. Headphones should ship by 12/15 which means domestic customers will have their in time for Christmas. International shipping might make it depending on where the package is headed. And now, some eye candy. Keep in mind how well the HD650 scales with better sources and amplification - I'm using sources from Aurender, Matrix, and SOtM, and DACs from Esoteric, Resonessence Labs, and B.M.C., along with a wide variety of amplification from Pass Labs, Cayin, Simaudio, Violectric, and others. The HD6XX isn't terribly picky in the same way as the K7XX, but at the same time it will massively reward you as the chain improves. I like it quite a bit off the Acoustic Research M2 but even the little Pono and iBasso DX90 do a pretty decent job. This is definitely a headphone that will grow with you as your system improves over time.
