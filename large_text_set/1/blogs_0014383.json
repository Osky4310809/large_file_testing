Malloy Updated 2349 GMT (0749   Miami residents grapple with Zika 02:33 Story highlights Lindsay C. Malloy: While pregnant with my second child, I had a false positive Zika test My experience isn't rare, she writes, and we need more funding for better testing and support Lindsay C. Malloy is a psychology professor at Florida International University. The opinions expressed are her own. (CNN) I live in Miami. I'm pregnant. I tested positive for the Zika virus. At least that's what I was told, and that's what I believed for six long, painful weeks. They were excruciating weeks of waiting for a special test that only the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do to confirm whether I had, in fact, contracted Zika during the beginning of my first trimester -- a crucial period of time for a fetus' brain and nervous system development. I endured over 40 anxiety-provoking days carrying my second baby, one that I wasn't sure I would be able to keep, before learning that my test result was -- thankfully -- a false positive. Lindsay Malloy I am a scientist. I've published many scientific papers. I've never published anything about my personal life, and even now, I am not entirely comfortable with the idea. But as Zika continues to spread, other women and families should be aware of what my family went through as they navigate testing and diagnosis themselves. We could have known more. My husband and I could have avoided a living hell during what should have been a joyous time in our lives. Facing this situation hits home for me in more ways than one. My husband is an entomologist who has done mosquito research. We knew how to protect ourselves while trying to conceive, and the critical importance of doing so. I had been reading about Zika for months, feeling heartbroken for pregnant women in Brazil and worried that the virus would travel to Miami (which, of course, it did ). Read More But at 36, I didn't have the luxury of waiting for a Zika vaccine before trying for another baby so we took extreme precautions from day one. We wore loose-fitting long sleeves and long pants, and socks and shoes, every day -- with DEET on our rare bits of exposed skin. We severely limited our outdoor time. If you've ever been to Miami in August, you know that the sweat pools in your lower back within moments of stepping outside, even when standing still in the shade, so imagine chasing after a toddler with almost every inch of your skin covered in 90 degree heat with 90% humidity. We were a spectacle, drawing stares at our local park, but it was worth dramatically decreasing our quality of life, we thought, in order to protect ourselves from Zika. I found out that I was pregnant with my second child very early on. We were thrilled. Despite our extreme precautions, I had my blood drawn for my free Zika test just one week later. I was shocked to receive the call from my OB -- my Zika antibody test was positive, meaning that I had likely been exposed to the virus in the past 12 weeks. My entire world stopped. Through sobs, I said that my positive result simply wasn't possible. We had made our lives miserable to (successfully) avoid mosquito bites. We had never traveled to the active transmission zones. It made no sense. JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:18:01.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
