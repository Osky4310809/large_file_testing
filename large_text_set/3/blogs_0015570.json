Pitcher Cody Anderson has a \"UCL sprain along with a mild flexor strain\" according to the Indians media release. He will have elbow reconstruction surgery (Tommy John) and be out for the entire season. \n2. The 26-year-old Anderson was in the Tribe starting rotation at the opening of the 2016 season. He was 2-5 with a 6.68 ERA. His arm was bothering him for most of the season. He had \"impingment\" elbow surgery after the 2016 season. \n3. Anderson still felt some arm problems this spring, and that led to the decision to have reconstruction surgery. The Indians were hoping he'd be healthy and supply depth in the starting rotation. \n4. Anderson said the surgery after the 2016 was to \"clean up\" some bone chips in his elbow. He felt better for a while as he worked on strengthening his arm. \n5. \"But a few weeks ago, I tried to air it out and I had to back off,\" Anderson told me. The pitcher said they talked about different options, but surgery was the best \"because I want to start moving forward.\" \n6. Anderson said his arm hadn't felt quite right for about a year. In 2015, he was 7-3 with a 3.05 ERA. He was considered one of the team's top pitching prospects. \n7. Manager Terry Francona said Anderson made \"a mature decision\" to opt for surgery. \"Knowing Cody, he'll come back even better, the way he works.\" \n8. Jason Kipnis had a second medical opinion on his sore right shoulder. Dr. Keith Meister agreed with the Tribe doctors, who said Kipnis has inflammation. He will rest for a week, then start hitting and throwing. \n9. Assuming the Tribe's star second baseman has no more setbacks, he will be able to play in 4-to-5 weeks, according the the Indians. That means he'll open the season on the disabled list. \n10. Outfielder Tyler Naquin is listed as \"day-to-day with bilateral knee soreness.\" Both of his knees are a bit sore. Waiting for more updates. Naquin was scratched from the lineup Saturday. \n11. Naquin said he will be fine \"in a couple of days\" and there was no need for people to \"blow it up\" in terms of concern about his knee. Francona said Naquin has \"petellar tendinitis.\" The plan is for Naquin to DH in a minor league game Wednesday. The Indians don't seem concerned about it being a long-term problem. Naquin is batting .458 this spring. \n12. The good news is Michael Brantley's comeback from shoulder problems continues to go well. He had been playing in minor league games. He will play in a big league game against the Dodgers on Monday. If all goes well, Brantley will play three games in the next four days. \n13. Francona said this of Brantley: \"By all accounts, Brantley feels really good.\" But the manager added there was no pressure to push Brantley to be ready for the April 3 opener. The goal is for Brantley to be fully ready to play when he does return.
