Punt voor Bertrand Traoré bij openingsduel Burkina Faso met Kameroen, 1-1 https://t.co/92fvefSnin pic.twitter.com/fFCFSpyt3j — AFC Ajax (@AFCAjax) January 14, 2017 Traore in opening day draw | News | Official Site | Chelsea Football Club https://t.co/PyXiMqZpcr — DanaBlue (@cfcdk) January 15, 2017 Traoré was in the starting lineup but lasted only an hour as Cameroon took the early lead and threatened to put the game out of reach in the second half. Burkina Faso’s early goal was ruled out for offside, but they did grab an equalizer fifteen minutes from time to share the spoils. While I did not get to watch the match, Traoré’s performance has garnered largely disappointing reviews, with Burkinabé goalkeeper Hervé Koffi Kouakou hailed as the man of the match. The Chelsea youngster himself was critical of his own performance but was happy with the key point, especially as the other game in the group, Gabon vs. Guinea-Bissau also finished, quite surprisingly, in a 1-1 draw. “This is a good result for us especially as we came from behind in this game. It was not an easy match, we were poor in the first half but then in the second we played better. We could have won at the end of the match but that's fine. This allows us to concentrate well for the second match.” “[Regarding my performance,] that's football. There are days like that and we have to accept it. I think of the team and the point for the draw is good to take. I do not think that to myself. Collectively, it was not bad” “We have to rest and prepare well [for the next game on Wednesday]”. -Bertrand Traoré; source: Africa Top Sports via Google Translate Next up for Traoré & Co will be hosts Gabon, who feature the mercurial talents of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Juventus youngster Mario Lemina.
