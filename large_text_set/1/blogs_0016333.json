But while the first season of the series has come and gone in the U.K., the show has yet to make it stateside... until, say, right now. Advertisement \nTo celebrate the incoming second season for the show, set to air in the U.K. this year, the first season of Lucky Man —which follows London cop Harry Clayton (James Nesbitt) after he comes into possession of a mystical artifact that grants him luck-altering abilities—is now available to watch for the first time in the U.S. and Canada through iTunes. Here’s your mandatory excelsior from Lee himself about the news: \nLuck has always been a fascinating subject to me, and I am thrilled to finally share that fascination and the story of Harry Clayton with audiences in the US and Canada. I feel like the luckiest man in the world. Excelsior! \nHow could you have possibly known that this statement came from Stan Lee without that “Excelsior” at the end? Anyway, if you’re interested in giving the series a shot, it’s available for purchase through iTunes now .
