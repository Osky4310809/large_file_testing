That's what I was talking about. I don't have a girlfriend,\" the Ghanaian striker said.\nPeople have weird pet names for their family members, I get that -- but this explanation doesn’t explain why Anas was so quick to backpedal during the interview. Perhaps he thought it sounded weird, but let’s break down exactly how this unfolded in that interview.\n“I appreciate my fans also. My wife, my girlfriend. Uh ... I mean my wife. Yeah. Sorry to say. I’m ... I’m so sorry, my wife.”\nThe only person who has said “my wife” more times in a sentence is Borat. If Anas really calls his daughter his girlfriend then why did he apologize? Why did things get so weird? None of this makes any sense.\nJudgement free zone: Is there anyone else out there who calls their daughter their girlfriend?\nh/t Vice Sports", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DAtOR2YIcEo?wmode=transparent&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=1", "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/20/africa/ghana-footballer-wife-girlfriend/index.html", "https://sports.vice.com/en_us/highlight/soccer-player-who-thanked-his-wife-and-his-girlfriend-now-says-he-calls-his-daughter-his-girlfriend?utm_campaign=trendsus&utm_source=vicesportstwitter"], "published": "2017-03-22T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:50:00.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
