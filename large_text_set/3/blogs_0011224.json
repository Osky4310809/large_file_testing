MANILA, Philippines â€” Welcome to the Kat Bersola show. After a subpar performance in their recent outings, the former University of the Philippines Lady Maroons captain is showing her old form to help UP arrest a four-game skid. Bersola paced the Lady Maroons in their 25-14, 18-25, 25-15, 25-10 victory over the University of the East Lady Warriors in the UAAP Season 79 Women's volleyball tournament at the FilOil Flying-V Centre in San Juan, Wednesday. On her loud return, Bersola said it's all business and she did what was expected of her. \"I just did my job sa posisyon ko (as a middle blocker.) Nagsasalita (ako) continously sa loob and chini-cheer up (ko) yung teammates ko,\" she said. The graduating blocker scored 18 points built on 15 attacks, two kill blocks and a service ace. Save for the second set, the Lady Maroons dominated the Lady Warriors, and Bersola said they just went back to what won them their first four games of the season. \"We just went back to basics and followed our game plan. We just tried to enjoy the game.\" The Lady Maroons will next face the De La Salle University Lady Spikers on Sunday at the same venue.
