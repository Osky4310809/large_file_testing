[5] Later that month, Samuel L. Jackson told Digital Spy that he would likely reprise his role as Frozone in the sequel. [6] In April 2015, Bird revealed to NPR that he has begun writing the screenplay for the sequel. [7] In May 2015, Bird confirmed that the Incredibles sequel would be his next film following Tomorrowland . [8] He also stated that the movie will not reflect trends in the superhero genre since the first film's release, explaining, \"I don't think that kind of idea stays interesting for very long. ... For me, the interesting thing was never the superhero part of it. It was more the family dynamic, and how do superhero things play into that.\" [9] \nAccording to the 2015 SÃ£o Paulo Disney Expo, the film was implied to be released in 2019 , fifteen years after the original. [10] It was later confirmed for release on June 21 , 2019 [11] but it was moved up to June 15 , 2018 , replacing Toy Story 4 . [12] Bird later confirmed on Twitter that Michael Giacchino will return as the composer. [13] \nOn October 26, 2016, the sequel's release date was swapped with Toy Story 4 's release date, due to the former's production moving a lot faster than anticipated, while the latter was lagging in production. \nIn November 2016, it was confirmed that Holly Hunter will reprise her role as Helen Parr in the sequel. [14] \nIn December 2016, it was confirmed on Samuel L. Jackson's Facebook page, that he had begun recording his lines for the highly anticipated sequel, confirming his return as Frozone.
