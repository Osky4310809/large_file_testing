But there are many reasons why our feline friends could be purring and they can be communicating a variety of things through their own personal language – and not all of the messages conveyed are positive.\nTurns out that there is such a thing as ‘inappropriate purring’, where a cat may actually be using its form of communication to relax itself in times of distress.\nA purr from our furry friend can mean many things from happiness to see their owner to their fear of a thunderstorm or an alert that they are in pain. However, rather than just a cry for help necessarily, the purring is often used by the cat as a form of self soothing.\nAccording to Pets4Home , inappropriate purring can confuse pet owners who are wondering why our cats are ‘singing’ during an examination by a vet or when they have a protective cone over their head. A female cat may purr while giving birth to a litter of kittens but this isn’t to identify that she is relaxed or content, it’s to keep herself and her kittens calm and is a unique self protective mechanism.\n(Picture: Getty) The purring helps the cat to block out outside sounds so all they hear is their own sound as a vibration through their bodies as well as aurally. This is why cats may purr when there are outside stimulus such as loud fireworks.\nCats will also soothe themselves when they are ill or of very old age by purring. However, it is important to remember than inappropriate purring is pretty uncommon and there will more than likely be other signs and symptoms that something is amiss too as well as just the sound that the cat is making.\n(Picture: Getty) He or she may display odd behaviours, be more subdued, may start to have accidents around the home or may become aggressive or more vocal. So hearing your cat purr should remain something to enjoy, unless there are other factors at play that could suggest a trip to the vet may be necessary. And while it shouldn’t be a cause for panic, cats CAN use this form of purring to warn you of something like an injury or discomfort to a major change in the house that you weren’t aware was distressing them.\n\nIf in doubt, the vet is the best bet. But in the meantime, continue to remember that cats will purr to show you affection far more often than they will purr to say something is wrong so while the extra knowledge and vigilance is necessary, don’t let it take away any of the comfort your pet’s purr brings to you both.\nIf anything, it adds another beautiful aspect to the sound we love to hear from our cats. Not only does it bring them joy in some scenarios; in others it brings them safety and helps them to relax.\nMORE: 12 odd cats who don’t quite know how to cat \nMORE: 15 reasons why cats are far better than boyfriends or girlfriends \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:59:37.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
