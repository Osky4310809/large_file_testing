Recently, a photo of a person who appears to be INFINITE’s Dongwoo being intimate with a woman at a cafe was revealed online. Due to low photo quality, it’s difficult to ascertain if it is really INFINITE’s Dongwoo. However, netizens posted a photo from three weeks ago of Dongwoo with webtoon writer Park Tae Joon, in which he is wearing similar clothes, leading netizens to claim that it is in fact the INFINITE member in the photo above. However, Woollim Entertainment said to Joongang Ilbo, “We checked with Dongwoo, and he said that the man in the photo is not him. There are no grounds for these rumors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:14:25.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
