It was Larson’s third victory in his last 13 starts in the series, and the sixth of his career overall. \n“The racing there with Joey at the end was awesome,” Larson said. \nBut as hard as Larson had to work, it paled in comparison to how hard Joey Logano had to pedal to finish second. \nLogano started from the pole. But he had to come from near the rear of the field not once, but twice – first after a speeding penalty dropped him from the lead to 35rd on Lap 31, and then again after his No. 22 Team Penske Ford fell off the jack on a pit stop on Lap 96. \nLogano passed nearly the combined total of 60 cars in all as he made his way back to the front on both occasions. \nAnd still it wasn’t a done deal when he regained the lead, as Kyle Larson, on fresher tires, made a pass with 17 to go – only to have Logano almost immediately pass him back to regain the advantage once again. \nLarson subsequently brushed the outside wall and fell back – but he was still faster on the fresher tires and worked hard to pass Logano yet again. He finally got back to his bumper and passed him again with 11 to go, then battled door-to-door, brushed the outside wall again, and used a lapped car as a pick to put Logano in his rear-view mirror for a third time. \nBut just as it appeared Larson might then sail away for the win, Brandon Jones hit the wall to bring out a caution and set up a restart with five to go. \nThis time, Logano got trapped behind the car of Spencer Gallagher, which had taken only two tires and could not get a good restart. \nGetting a push from Kyle Busch in fourth, lined up on the outside behind him, Larson then sailed away to victory. Busch ended up third behind Larson and Logano. \nKyle Busch was running second with 28 laps to go when he appeared to run through some Speedy-Dry and got into the outside wall, dropping him all the way to fifth before he could regroup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:16:41.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
