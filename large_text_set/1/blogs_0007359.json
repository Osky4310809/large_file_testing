Between all of the loving commentary on Twitter, and even a shout out from GQ, it is safe to say brown velvet is the new black!\nChildish Gambino a.k.a Donald Glover has had a pretty great year. Not only did he and the cast of Atlanta take home the Golden Globe for Best TV Series-Musical or comedy (which he created, wrote, and starred in), but he also released a neo-soul funk fusion album , and he landed roles in both the new Spider-Man , and Star Wars movie, where he plays Lando Calrissian . But it is the bold suit look that we are even more shocked about! Seriously we think Glover needs to win the riskiest award of the 2017 Golden Globes.\nDonald Glover wins the red carpet. #GoldenGlobes \nA photo posted by GQ (@gq) on Jan 8, 2017 at 5:58pm PST \nOn a night where guys usually show up in the same black tuxedo, or a daring male wears the occasional navy blue, we were stunned to see him not only wearing brown, but the suit is velvet. Normally we would oppose but for this occasion we would have to give him two thumbs up. On anyone else we arenâ€™t sure if they could pull off the look, but because Glover is known for his unique style and personality we appreciate the difference in suit choice.\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images Kevork Djansezian/NBC/Getty Images Donald Glover is bad and boujee indeed !\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T05:18:17.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
