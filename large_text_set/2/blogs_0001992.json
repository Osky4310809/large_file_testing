She said more people would be open to hearing the opinions of celebrities if they were willing to engage in more civil discourse. \nBaier said that people he knows in the industry are concerned about speaking out at all, but he also brought up Morgan Freeman ‘s more “practical” take on a Trump presidency. \nLeslie Marshall argued that there’s really nothing new about Hollywood being this openly political––given celebrity activism during the Bush years––and said that people are afraid, but Loudon shot back that conservatives were afraid for 8 years and the rhetoric is far more dangerous now. \nMarshall countered that there were Democrats who got threatened early on in Obama’s first term. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:32:03.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
