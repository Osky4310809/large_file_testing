No. 1 DASH diet Shutterstock \nFor the seventh year in a row, the DASH diet was named the best. DASH stands for \"Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.\" Hypertension, otherwise known as abnormally high blood pressure, is an incredibly common condition in the US. \nIt relies on lowering your sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams a day, along with eating a diet filled with vegetables, fruits, and whole grains (For reference, a single slice of pizza contains about 640 milligrams of sodium, roughly a quarter of that sodium limit). \n\"The DASH diet is really a safe plan for everyone,\" Angela Haupt, assistant managing editor of Health at US News & World Report, told Business Insider in 2016 . \"There's nothing exciting about it and that's what makes it a good plan. It's not some fad diet making outlandish claims that you can't rely on.\" \nIn addition to being crowned overall best diet, the DASH diet was also deemed the best diet for healthy eating, the best diet for diabetes, and the best diet for heart disease.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T15:36:20.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
