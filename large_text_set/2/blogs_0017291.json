Selection Sunday is looking like it may end up drama-free, too.\nBouncing back from Saturday’s blowout loss to Villanova, the Pirates pulled out a 71-64 win over Xavier on Wednesday night at Prudential Center, adding another much-needed win over a likely NCAA Tournament team to the Pirates’ résumé behind Angel Delgado’s 25 points and 13 rebounds.\nSeton Hall (17-10, 7-8), which opened its three-game homestand with a win over Creighton, is now in position to get back to .500 in the Big East with a road game at last-place DePaul on Saturday.\nOther than Delgado, the Pirates couldn’t get going offensively early, and trailed 23-16 midway through the first half, but Seton Hall responded with a 9-0 run, and ended up down 31-30 at halftime.\nDelgado nearly posted his ninth straight double-double in the first half — putting up 13 points and eight rebounds — and continued carrying the Pirates in the second half, helping turn a six-point deficit into a double-digit lead. \nDespite reigning Big East Player of the Week Khadeen Carrington’s five-point performance and another poor night from the team at the free-throw line, Seton Hall controlled the second half with a strong showing by Desi Rodriguez, who finished with 22 points, and timely shooting from Myles Powell.\nJ.P. Macura led Xavier (18-10, 8-7) with 19 points.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:05:51.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
