He declared Williams Ajayi and Ilesanmi Obe, who sued for themselves and on behalf of other members of their faction, as the authentic state chairman and secretary of the PDP in the state. He consequently sacked the state executive committee chaired by Gbenga Oguntuase, a loyalist of Governor Ayodele Fayose. Justice Taiwo Taiwo gave the verdict after refusing a request to stay the delivery of the judgment by counsel for Oguntuase’s faction, Bimpe Olatemiju. The judge, who engaged the lawyer in a series of arguments, said the request was a ploy to arrest the judgment. Olatemiju had referred the court to a letter written by Mike Ozekhome (SAN) based on a Notice of Appeal at the Court of Appeal, Ado Ekiti, listed for hearing on February 1, 2017. The appeal sought to challenge the ruling of Justice Taiwo that “imposed” a lawyer on the party against the wish of the Makarfi-led faction. But the judge in his ruling said there was no record to show that an appeal had been duly entered or that the record of proceedings had been transmitted and received at the Court of Appeal. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the court, Olatemiju sought the court’s permission to leave since he had already declared his intention not to be part of the proceedings based on the pending appeal. But Justice Taiwo ordered him to sit down, threatening to report him to the Nigeria Bar Association’s Ethics and Privileges Committee if he refused to obey. The lawyer asked the judge whether he was under arrest and insisted that he would leave the court. But the judge rebuffed him. Justice Taiwo said the motion on notice pending at the appeal court filed by the second, third, fourth and fifth defendants to change their lawyer and appoint Ozekhome as the lead counsel was not enough to delay the delivery of the judgement. The judge, who held that Senator Alimodu Sheriff and Prof. Wale Oladipo were the recognised National Chairman (third defendant) and Secretary (fourth defendant) of the PDP (second defendant) at the time the case was filed, noted that none of the parties controvert the plaintiffs. According to him, all the averments in the affidavits are deemed admitted since they were not challenged by the defendants. He said, “A political party must operate within certain guidelines and when there is a crisis of this nature in a party, we use the party’s constitution and the 1999 Constitution to remedy the crisis. “It is not in dispute that the second, third, fourth and fifth respondents were jointly represented, and it is not in dispute that the second and third are members of the PDP. It is not also in dispute that the third and fourth respondents were still acting as the chairman and national secretary. “So, going by the PDP’s guidelines, the power to conduct congresses at the wards, local governments and state levels can only be directed by the NWC and since these people were still in charge at that time, any other directive or parallel congress by any other body is null and void.” Reacting to the jugement, Oguntuase said his faction would appeal the judgment. “I plead with all the PDP members in the state to remain calm. In that judgement, I saw humour and I didn’t see honour and candour. “How will you call yourself a chairman when the governor is not behind you, when all the National Assembly members and the state assembly lawmakers are not behind you? So, this is not the last court,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
