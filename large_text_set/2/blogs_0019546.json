A lion, I guess. There is an old saying: all lions are felines, but not all felines are lions. Let everyone mind their own business. I don’t think that there is an animal in their zoo that can tell a bear what to do,” Sergey Shoigu said while answering questions from students at a conference held by the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Tuesday.

He is testing the alliance [NATO]. At any point he sees weakness, he pushes home,” Fallon said. \n“That’s why it is important we stand up for our values and we continue to back the Sarraj [the prime minister of the UN-recognized government of Libya] government while urging it to be more representative of the interests of the east.” \nLibya has been in turmoil since the killing of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, following an armed rebellion backed by Western military intervention.

However, Libya’s Tobruk-based parliament, supported by troops loyal to Haftar, refused to cooperate with the unity government. \nCommenting on the situation in Libya, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, said that the crisis could be settled only in cooperation with all political forces operating in the country, while calling attempts to dictate decision from outside the country “counterproductive.” \n“It’s clear that the country’s future must be determined by Libyans. We believe that the attempts to impose ready-made solution on them are counterproductive,” Lavrov said in his February 10 interview to the Russian Izvestiya newspaper, stressing that Moscow “continues meticulously working with both power centers in Libya.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:57:06.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
