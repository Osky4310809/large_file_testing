Why Were FBI, CIA, NSA, Justice, Treasury Involved?   7, 2017 \nMark Levin said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was incorrect when he said no FISA warrants were executed against Trump aides. Levin explains McClatchy reported the FBI, CIA, National Security Agency, Justice Department, Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Unit network were unleashed and that the New York Times reported on a wiretap launched to monitor \"Trump aides.\" Part two of the interview below. From his Monday night appearance on Hannity : MARK LEVIN: It is only conservatives who are concerned about what they are reading in liberal media. Have you you noticed that? The media is very compounded right now, they are very confused. They don't know whether to trash themselves, trash their colleagues, or what. You asked a question. What did Obama know? We know he knows this much. Everything you just read, he knew. Because it's in the newspapers. That is pretty big. Number two, we know that if a FISA warrant was secured, it is very likely in his daily intelligence briefing or a call from the Attorney General or the director of the FBI the president would be given a heads up. There's nothing illegal about it but he would have been given a heads up. Here's what else we know. There are all kinds of, based on these reports, investigative activities going on. McClatchy reported the agencies involved, the FBI, CIA, National Security Agency, Justice Department, Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Unit network, I assume Obama knew something. I mean unless he is Helen Keller. Let me make another point about this. That is a hell of a lot of agency resources. Those are a hell of a lot of investigators. The news reports should mention The New York Times , January 20th, I just want to make sure CNN and MSNBC are aware of this. ' Wiretapped Data Used In Inquiry Of Trump Aides .' I never said independent of news reports about the wiretaps -- 'wiretapped data used in inquiry of trump aides.' Well, didn't [former DNI] Mr. Clapper say there were no FISA orders ? It's very important because if Clapper says there was no FISA order and he was very broad and definite, and he said no... then what the hell are we talking about? That means that they did not have enough information for probably cause to get a warrant in front of the FISA court. So what's the FBI, the CIA, National Security Agency, Justice Department, Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Unit network investigating? What are these wiretaps that The New York Times is talking about? You know, I know they want to focus on Donald Trump and his tweets. I want to focus on America and the constitution. The reason I got fed up with this last week is because I am a constitutional conservative. I look at this, if I'm reading these news reports, we have of runaway executive branch. I don't know who knows what and as of today, the media don't appear to know who knows what which is exactly why I've been calling for Congressional investigations. The question is: why aren't CNN, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and all the rest of them, why aren't they not concerned about this? Rather than mock the president, pay attention to what your own reporters and other reporters are saying.
