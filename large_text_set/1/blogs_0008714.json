The Soca Warriors hosted the tournament, which put the three best second-place teams from the third round of Caribbean Cup qualifying in a round-robin. Suriname beat Trinidad and Tobago in extra time in the opening match, but Haiti easily handled Suriname, conceding two late but still winning 4-2. \nNeeding a win by two goals, Trinidad and Tobago got off to a fast start, with Shahdon Winchester scoring in the opening minute. But young New York Red Bulls forward Derrick Etienne found a first-half equalizer. Winchester doubled his goal total for the day before the break only for Kervens Belfort to head in a free kick to again bring things level. \nWhile Haiti could've scored an own goal late to lose the contest but advance on goal difference, interim coach Jean-Claude Josaphat had his side push for a goal only at the other end. In extra time, Belfort again headed in a goal, but Trinidad and Tobago defender Radanfah Abu Bakr, deployed as an emergency striker assisted Winchester, who again put the match back in the balance. Finally, former MLS defender Andrew Jean-Baptiste scored for Haiti and put the match out of reach. \nHaiti now will wait for the fifth-place team from this month's Copa Centroamericana for a two-legged playoff to decide which side will capture the final spot in this summer's Gold Cup.
