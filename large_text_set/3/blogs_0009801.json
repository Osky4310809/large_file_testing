Ditto the test mule’s sides and flanks – these also appear to be unchanged. \nThe rear end is where clues are more telling of the Performante’s distinguishing features. Though its tail lamps and bumper are largely unchanged, exhausts are now relocated higher up the rear fascia, with the existing central housing for the exhaust outlet now vacant on the test mule. \nOf course, more performance is the order of the day. The Aventador Performante is expected to run the current short-stroke, naturally-aspirated 6.5 litre V12 engine, with drive sent to all four corners via a development of the existing Independent Shift Rod (ISR) single-clutch sequential gearbox. \nOutputs will certainly be greater than those of the Aventador S, edging closer still to the 800 hp mark, making for a close rival to the Ferrari 812 Superfast in the horsepower stakes. Expect marginal improvements on the 0-100 km/h time of 2.9 seconds achieved by the Aventador S. \nAlso en vogue and expected on the 12-cylinder Performante bull is four-wheel steering, which aims to give a virtual lengthening or shortening of the car’s wheelbase for better high-speed stability and lower speed agility, respectively. With the Aventador S launched at the end of last year, the Aventador Performante could make it for a debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show later this year. \nGALLERY: Lamborghini Aventador S", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T08:34:09.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
