Both the 8GB or 12GB RAM options should run multiple reasonably-demanding standard applications at once. Drive sizes vary from 256GB to 1TB hard drives. There's a generous two year guarantee too if you buy from John Lewis.\n\n\nOne of the cheapest brand new 2-in-1 laptops we&apos;ve seen in a while and an ideal entry point to casual users wanting to try out the world of these higher function tablet/laptop hybrids. Specs include 2GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a 10-inch 1080p screen, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 and an Intel Atom processor.\n\n\nThere's some hefty grunt under the shell of this HP 250 G4 and there are some great prices this week. The Intel Pentium processor and 4GB/8GB of RAM mean this laptop will whip through pretty much any day-to-day activity you can throw at it without the juddering performance of cheaper laptops. Hell, it'll even have a decent crack at playing a few of the less demanding games out there.\n\n\nFrom afar, this laptop might be mistaken for a MacBook Pro which tells you a lot about its level of quality. Don&apos;t expect a full metal chassis at this price, but this is probably one of the best looking plastic bodies in its category. There are plenty of ports (old and new), 4GB of RAM and a massive 1TB hard drive. The cheapest models have a respectable i3 processor, but you can get the more powerful i5 versions for not much more if you need that extra kick. Asus saw it fit to include a DVD writer as well as a 15.6-inch full HD screen. Despite this large display and the presence of a numeric keypad, it&apos;s just a tad thicker and heavier than an Ultrabook.\nWhy not upgrade your storage with a cheap hard drive or SSD? See the best hard drive and SSD deals.  \n\nThe best deals on our favourite laptops \nWe&apos;ve reviewed loads of laptops over the years: we&apos;ve seen the good ones, the great ones and the ones to avoid. Sometimes the best laptops pop up online at some truly deal-tastic prices. So in this section, we list the very best laptops out there and the best deals on each one.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 is, bar none, the best laptop you can buy today. It features a revolutionary design that's astonishingly thin and light. Fitting a 13.3-inch screen into such a small frame means Dell has created a nearly borderless Infinity display. It's a powerful and long lasting machine even by today's Ultrabook standards. The XPS 13 comes outfitted with Intel's latest Skylake processors plus lighting, quick storage and memory, all while coming in at a very affordable starting price. For these reasons, it easily takes the top slot as the best Ultrabook , the best Windows laptop and the best overall laptop.\n\n\nThis is one of the best value Ultrabooks on the market and has been on our shortlist for a few months already. Its price has gone up marginally because of the exchange rate but with a gorgeous finish, a full HD display and a Core M CPU for under £600, it's the one to beat.\n\n\nThis 10-inch hybrid comes packing a surprising amount of goods considering its small size. It's outfitted with an HD screen and more than enough power to get you through a simple day of web browsing and even image editing. When you're ready kick back with some media streaming, you can pop off the 10-inch tablet.\n\n\nIt is expensive but this Inspiron 7559 absolutely nailed it when it comes to value for money especially for hardcore gamers. It is even out-prices Dell somehow and manages to beat laptops that costs a third more when it comes to specifications. A quad-core desktop-grade Core i7 CPU, full HD display, a GTX960M with 4GB of memory and a 1TB (models vary) hybrid drive.\n\nLenovo has crafted a brilliant, forward-thinking device that could very well create a subcategory in computing all of its own. The modest specs hold it back from taking on the big boys in terms of raw power, but the innovative digital touchpad keyboard and drawing surface look like trendsetters to us. The Android version is currently about £100 cheaper than the Windows one (click &apos;see all prices&apos; above to see all options).\n\n\nThe Asus Chromebook Flip isn't perfect, but it's an impressive little piece of kit. Plus, it's so affordable that you might want to pick one up just to have a Chromebook on hand – even if you already own a MacBook or Windows laptop. Aside from the budget price tag, the Flip is one of the best-built Chromebooks to blaze the trail onward for more convertibles. Touchscreen functionality feels more logical, with a screen that actually rotates. The Flip meets all the core tenants of an ideal Chrome OS device.\n\n\nCan a tablet really replace your laptop or home PC? That's still up for debate, but the best tablet trying to make that happen is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 - and it does a fine job with the full blown version of Windows 10, an integrated kickstand and optional keyboard attachment. Great for for creative professionals, students and everyday folks alike - it's only the premium price that push it down the list, but if you're willing to pay for it, you're getting a lot of power. A LOT.\n\nNot quite what you&apos;re looking for?
