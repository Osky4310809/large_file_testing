It’s frustrating, and even more frustrating is the fact that you don’t just have one credit score . You have quite a few of them, and this latest news about Experian goes to show that this isn’t common knowledge.

They track and gauge consumer credit through reports and scores. This week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined Experian $3 million for confusion over the scores they provide. MarketWatch reports : Advertisement Advertisement \nIn its complaint against Experian, the CFPB said in some instances, there were significant differences between the credit scores the company provided to consumers and the credit scores lenders actually used. “As a result, Experian’s credit scores in these instances presented an inaccurate picture of how lenders assessed consumer creditworthiness,” the agency said. \nExperian isn’t the only one, though. Transunion and Equifax both paid similar fines earlier this year. The issue is that, according to the CFPB, these bureaus made customers believe that their proprietary scores were the same ones used by lenders to make lending decisions. \nIn reality, you have a handful of different scores , and some of them even differ depending on what kind of loan you apply for (also, credit isn’t just used for lending. Landlords and bill providers also check your credit). There are scores specific to mortgage lending, for example. However, the generic FICO score is the oldest model and FICO says that their model is used in 90% of credit decisions. Your overall credit credit scores should be pretty similar, but there’s no guarantee. Your best bet is probably to focus on your report instead , which gives you a much more detailed view of your credit, from specific cards you have open to accounts that have gone to collections to balances you owe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T19:59:15.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
