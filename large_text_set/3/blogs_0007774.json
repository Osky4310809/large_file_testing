Arsenal played very well with 10 men\" Share It wasn't supposed to end like this Arsene (Photo: PA) Share Get Arsenal FC   \nBayern Munich boss Carlo Ancelotti is not sure whether Arsene Wenger will survive the latest Arsenal embarrassment. \nThe Gunners lost 5-1 at home to Anecelotti's side in the Champions League last 16 second leg, the exact same score from the first leg. \nAnd pressure mounts on the Frenchman, who is out of contract at the end of the season, to step down at 21 years in charge. \nAsked if Wenger can survive, Ancelotti told reporters: \"I don't know. I am not the owner of Arsenal but he is more experienced than me, can handle pressure. \n\"The result doesn't reflect what happened. Arsenal played very well with 10 men.\" \nWenger, meanwhile, saved his ire for the referee following Laurent Koscielny's second half red card that handed Bayern a penalty to go ahead and killed the game. \nKoscielny was initially given a yellow card, but then sent off. Ten-man Arsenal then crumbled after his departure, just as they did in the first leg when he went off injured. \n\"There are difficult aspects in the game that explain that we're out,\" he said to BT Sport after the game. \"I feel we produced the game we wanted and we were really unlucky with some of the decisions. It's really hard to understand.

The turning point was going down to ten men. It became impossible for the players after that.\" \n“I’m absolutely revolted and I’m sorry for people coming paying their money to see this sort of game.” \nAsked about the fan protests before the game he responded “I’ve nothing to add to that\" but when asked if this will be his last Champions League match in charge of the Gunners he said: \"I don't know\". (Photo: PA) \nHe continued to lay the blame at the door of the referee in his post match press conference. “No [the players have not let us down], the referee has let us down,\" he said. \n“In the 2nd half the referee killed the game … not only was it not penalty, it was offside. That killed us completely.” \n“The decision leaves me very angry, frustrated. I think it’s absolutely unexplainable and scandalous.” \n“I think we can compete with Bayern Munich and we have shown that in the 1st half. I think this club is in a great shape. What needs to change is the result in the next game.\" \nArsenal 1-5 Bayern Munich (agg: 2-10) player ratings: Who impressed as the Gunners crash out? \nFormer Gunners striker Ian Wright said that he believes the club are reaching the end of an era. \n\"It's a sad day because we've gone out again at this stage. We're going through a period in our history that's the worst in history I can remember. (Photo: Getty) \n\"With everything that's going on you have to say it will take some sort of monumental effort for Arsenal to turn it around in terms of the drive and determination of the players. It feels like something is coming to an end.\" \nWenger is out of contract this summer and this humiliating exit will leave the club struggling to justify him getting a new deal. poll loading Will this be Wenger's final season as Arsenal boss? 11000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:15:24.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
