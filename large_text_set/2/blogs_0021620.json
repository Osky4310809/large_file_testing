Rani ki Vav (the Queen's Stepwell), Patan \nA UNESCO's World Heritage Site, Rani ki Vav is an ancient stepwell dating back to the 11th century. It was also constructed during the Solanki dynasty, apparently in memory of ruler Bhimdev I, by his widowed wife. The stepwell has stairs going down seven levels, and panels containing more than 500 main sculptures and over 1,000 minor ones. Only discovered relatively recently, the stepwell was flooded by the nearby Saraswati River and silted over until the late 1980s. When it was excavated by the Archeological Survey of India, its carvings were found in pristine condition. Where: Northern Gujarat. Patan is around 130 kilometers from Ahmedabad and 35 kilometers from Modhera.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:38.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
