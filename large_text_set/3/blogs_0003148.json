Allison Marchese was a keen user of social media, sending messages and photos \nThe younger student was only 14 when their relationship began. \nNow Marchese has been jailed for three years, Fox61 reports. \nUnder the terms of a plea deal, Marchese pleaded guilty to two counts each of first-degree unlawful restraint and reckless endangerment, and one count each of harassment and threatening, the broadcaster said. \nA previous plea deal - which fell through - would have seen Marchese plead guilty to two counts of risk of injury to a minor, it was reported. \nBut had she proceeded to trial she would have faced a maximum of 20 years. \nIt was unclear if her Canadian citizenship would see her deported.
