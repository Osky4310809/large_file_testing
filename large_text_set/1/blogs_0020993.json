'Forced' transfer of just eight drivers triggers Tube strike \nMick Cash, RMT general secretary, said: \"RMT negotiators have made strenuous efforts through the Acas machinery to resolve this dispute but the door has been slammed in our faces. \n\"If LU are allowed to get away with this move on the Central line they will start shunting drivers around at the drop of a hat regardless of the consequences.\" \nSteve Griffiths, London Underground's chief operating officer, said: \"This strike is completely unnecessary. Everything you need to know about this week's Tube strike \n\"Like any responsible transport authority we regularly examine how we can provide the best possible service to customers and to achieve this sometimes we need to move staff from locations where they are under-utilised, to the places where they are really needed. \n\"We have agreements with the trade unions that enable us to do this. \n\"Following a review on the Central line we identified eight train drivers on the east end of the line where there is not enough work for them and we have asked them to move to another line where their work would make a real difference and help give our customers a better service.\" \nTube bosses are trying to prevent worse strike action from February 6 which would affect the entire network over a separate dispute involving station staff.
