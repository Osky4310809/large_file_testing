Most Popular By Jack Holmes Mar 2, 2017 Wednesday was filled with glowing reviews for President Trump's big speech to Congress, which historians are already calling The Gettysburg Ask Not If You Can Tear Down That Wall Address . But as the late-night brigade pointed out last night, most pundits managed to convince themselves the speech was spectacular by grading it on a voluptuous bell curve. Seth Meyers went after the various talking heads, including Van Jones and Chris Wallace, the latter of whom said, \"Tonight, Donald Trump became President of the United States.\"   Most Popular \"I bet there are some Muslims and undocumented immigrants,\" Seth Meyers shot back with more than a hint of anger, \"that would tell you you became president back in fucking January.\" This is the rub. The Beltway types are not directly affected by Trump's presidency, except that it prevents them from coasting along as they normally would, explaining how \"both sides\" do it and asking, why can't we all just get along? Talking heads have repeatedly tried to rehabilitate Trump—like, as Meyers pointed out, last April, when they congratulated him for not calling Ted Cruz a schoolyard insult—so that things can go back to \"normal.\" In fact, that's the exact word they used for Trump's speech Monday night—when, as Stephen Colbert also pointed out, the president suggested some fairly extreme things: VOICE, for instance, is little more than a way to demonize all immigrants, who just happen to commit crime at lower rates than native-born citizens. (If there's an entire government agency devoted to immigrant crime, though, it must be a terrible problem!) Yet Trump announced it in a calm voice—\"Make America great again, Clarice,\" quipped Colbert in a mini-skit—which indicates a new tone that we should all celebrate and get behind. Colbert also piled onto the bigotry-of-low-expectations critique, as he flashed assessments like The Washington Post 's \"surprisingly presidential.\" \"I like that four score and seven years ago thing,\" Colbert read from a mock newspaper article on Lincoln's Gettysburg Address , \"Plus, he didn't stop once to mock the disabled.\" As Esquire's Charles P. Pierce pointed out in the run-up , you could feel the Beltway ecosystem preparing itself to be encouraged by the speech well before it happened. Trump simply must become just another Republican president, so that the dinner parties can be attended and the think-pieces on why we need more bipartisan cooperation can be mailed in. President Trump has simply demanded too much time, thinking power, and courage in response. If he would only speak more softly, and carry a big deportation stick, all would be right with The Swamp. For those of us not willing ourselves towards blissful ignorance, however, there's a lot more work to be done.
