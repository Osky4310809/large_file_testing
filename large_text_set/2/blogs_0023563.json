PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 GETTY The Government is under pressure to drop proposals for a ‘transitional period’ \nA report by the pro-Brexit campaign group Change Britain has revealed that a transitional arrangement which would allow free movement to continue over five years would see 912,000 to 970,000 EU nationals pouring into the UK. \nThe findings show that the influx will heighten pressure on our housing meaning that Britain will require the construction of between 69,000 and 74,000 homes just to house EU migrants. \nIt is also estimated that between 163,000 and 172,000 of these nationals will be school age.

EU demands Britain goes to them for talks \nThis will put substantial pressure on our school system, and would cost between £753 million and £793 million. \nTory Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, a leading supporter of Change Britain, said: “Public services are already facing serious pressures, particularly at the frontline in Dover and Kent. GETTY Tory Dover MP Charlie Elphicke is a leading supporter of Change Britain \n“Keeping free movement - unchecked immigration from Europe - for a moment longer than we have to would only make matters worse. \n“We need sensible arrangements for certain industries – but Britain must take back control of its borders as a matter of urgency.” Brexit: Which parts of the UK had the majority vote? Fri, February 17, 2017 Much of the North East of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union including Sunderland, Gateshead, Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Stockton, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside, and Northumberland. Newcastle was the only borough to vote to remain. Getty Images 1 of 8 GREAT YARMOUTH: The town of Great Yarmouth on the East Coast of England voted by 72% to leave the European Union. GETTY David Davis has also said he is open to a transitional deal as part of the final exit deal Outside the EU we can build a fairer system to manage the impact of immigration Tory Dover MP Charlie Elphicke \nHe added: “Outside the EU we can build a fairer system to manage the impact of immigration on our public services and communities. \n\"This is what the public voted for. This is what the people demand. This is what we have a duty to deliver.” \nThe findings come after the Manufacturers Organisation - formerly known as the Engineering Employers' Federation (EEF) - led calls for a five year transitional deal, which is also reportedly supported by Chancellor Philip Hammond. \nBrexit Secretary David Davis has also said he is open to a transitional deal as part of the final exit deal. \nIf Theresa May succeeds in her aim of triggering Article 50 by the end of March 2017, and that   EU takes place on 1 April 2019, this means that the UK will be subject to a transition deal until 2024 which could mean Britain has open borders to the EU for another seven years.
