New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: [SPONSORED] MOD-ONE | Custom CaseLabs BH2 Build Log and Give Away! Welcome to the MOD-ONE ( mod-one.com ) custom CaseLabs Bullet BH2 giveaway and build log! What is this? We have decided to show off our modding skills and new MOD-ONE products in a build log. At the end of it all, we will be giving away the “build” to one lucky winner. OPEN WORLD WIDE! What are we giving away? Custom made cables sleeved in MDPC-X Sleeve More unseen custom goodies (stay tuned to find out what). How to I enter? Follow this thread, and subscribe by posting in it at least once. You must be an overclock.net member to post, but it’s super easy do. Just click on the “person” icon at the top right of the page and follow the instructions. The icon looks like this: Just some clarification on the giveaway details. This is not a complete system. You will need a CPU and cooler, video card, RAM and a hard drive to finish it off. I will provide the boxes and packaging for the motherboard, PSU and case. If any of the items need to be RMA’d for any reason, it is up to the winner to sort it out. I will keep all items in excellent condition, but sometimes you just never know if something is bad. Posting multiple times will not increase your chances of winning. So please don’t fill this thread up with “in again” type of posts. I don’t have an ETA for this project to be completed, but as of right now, I’m going to say sometime in late September or October of this year. So sit back, enjoy the mods, progress, and new MOD-ONE modding accessories and tools! A Note to those who subbed early on, Sorry for the ruse early on, but I need to make sure certain things happened when they did before I made the announcement! My plan from the begging was to do this, hence the name “A Build Has No Name”. This is because it will be up to the winner to name it after the build is completed by them! The ruse... :p (Click to show) Hello All! Welcome to my log : ) To those that don't recognize my user name, my name is Kevin, formally \"Kevin_CL\" of CaseLabs. I have started my own shop called MOD-ONE, and this \"build\" is a little promo project for that. I have some SUPER cool things planed, and I'm sure you all won't be disappointed with the out come. Be sure to sub, and I'll be sure to post updates as often as I can. I will announce parts and plans as soon as they arrive in my hands and my mind. Kinda want to keep things a surprise. On a small side note, I have decided to only work with natural window light for all images posted. The only exception is the images of the mdpc \"mini reels\" side by side. It's pretty challenging for myself to be honest, but I wanted to try something different. Ya scratch that. I tired, but my room isn't well suited for it for larger items. The mobo, and PSU however were both done with only window light Edited by MOD-ONE - 8/13/16 at 12:16am", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T11:25:57.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
