Knock yourself out. \nThe United States Capitol? Not so much. \nSo, Congressman Duncan Hunter took things into his own hands and took it down. \nThat didn’t sit well with the guy who put the picture up in the first place. \nWhat did he do? \nFrom Conservative Tribune : \nWhen Rep. Duncan Hunter took down a painting hung in the U.S. Capitol that depicted police officers as pigs, Rep. William Lacy Clay was livid at the California Republican. Even though Rep. Hunter had only taken down the painting and returned it to the Missouri Democrat’s office because it was offensive to police, Clay wanted Hunter to pay dearly for making him look bad. \nSo, what did Clay do about Hunter’s decision to take down a painting that depicted police as pigs? He, uh, went to the police. \nIf irony and cognitive dissonance could create power, the Democrats would ensure we would never have to worry about drilling another drop of oil. \n“He had no right to take that picture down,” Clay said Monday, according to The Washington Post . “It’s thievery.” \nOh, the irony. \nWe’ve seen this before. \nWho did the BLM protesters call in Dallas when shots rang out? The cops. \nWho does everyone call when they need help? The cops. \nI can’t imagine the police are going to be too sympathetic in this case. \nHunter didn’t even steal the painting so I don’t know what this guy is talking about.
