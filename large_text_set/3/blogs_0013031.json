However, the director has made some key changes in the cinematic adaptation of the novel, which includes eliminating Chetan himself. \nIn case you haven’t read the novel, let me tell you that Chetan was the narrator of Half Girlfriend , and had a pivotal role in the story. But Mohit decided to omit his character, and Chetan willingly gave him the creative liberty to do so. Speaking about further changes in the movie adaptation, Mohit told Mid-day : \nThe book was written in English, but the hero cannot converse in that language, so that has been changed. There was also some sexual abuse backstory to Shraddha’s character that I have tweaked. She has a dark past. But the story will concentrate more on the love (between her and Arjun’s character). \nI am really interested to see how this pans out! 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T13:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T11:16:05.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
