LG G6 to feature 5.7-inch QHD+ FullVision display and UX 6.0 with enhanced multitasking   LG G6 will flaunt the world’s first 5.7-inch quad-HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio” \nIn January, LG introduced the world’s first 5.7-inch quad-HD+ display with an aspect ratio of 18:9, which was expected to feature on the LG G6. Now the Korean tech giant has officially announced that the LG G6 will feature this display. The phone will also get the brand’s new mobile UX 6.0, which is specially customised to maximise the advantages of the phone’s expensive FullVision screen. \nThe LG G6’s new UX 6.0 has been designed to offer a differentiated experience for viewing content such as videos and web browsing. The FullVision screen features an expanded top and bottom, which allows users to view more information when surfing the internet, playing games or reading e-books. \nThe UX 6.0’s graphical user interface allows opening of two square windows side by side to deliver a better multitasking experience. Check out the video below for reference. \nLG also said that the camera UX on the UX 6.0 has been considerably enhanced thanks to the 18:9 aspect ratio. The Square Camera feature divides the screen into two identical squares. With this, users can capture images in a 1:1 format for social media apps and review them in the adjacent window. The brand has also added a Food Mode for high colour quality and saturation ideal for capturing food. \nThe LG G6 with the new UX 6.0 will be unveiled at the brand’s pre-MWC event in Barcelona on February 26th. We will be at the event to bring you more on the upcoming flagship.
