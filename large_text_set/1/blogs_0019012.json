In fact, Hillary Clinton’s stunning upset loss to President Donald J. Trump seems to have prompted some of her top allies to open another front to defeat the president through impeachment. Joe Schoffstall and Lachlan Markay of the Washington Free Beacon have obtained a confidential memo from longtime Clinton ally David Brock that alleges he will use his PAC, American Bridge, to set the wheels in motion. This will be a multi-year project, with Brock hoping that articles of impeachment against Trump will come out of their work. He also hopes to build a network of donors that rivals the right-leaning Koch Brothers: Brock is currently at the Turnberry Isle Resort in Aventura, Fla. for a weekend conference with more than 100 major liberal donors. Attendees are mapping out a course to combat the newly sworn-in president.\nAccording to the private and confidential memo, Brock plans to defeat Trump “through impeachment,” using American Bridge, his liberal super PAC, as the main vehicle to do so. \n“No other progressive organization has the resources and assets that American Bridge has amassed over the past several election cycles to hold Trump, his administration, and the politicians accountable,” the 44-page confidential memo states. \n[…] \nBrock’s group claims to have more than 20,000 hours of video, 289 candidate research books, and the largest available archive of Trump research in the Democratic Party. Within weeks of the election, Bridge launched a “Trump War Room,” which has already scrutinized Trump’s transition team and will continue to watch the personnel, policies, and practices of the administration. \nThe “state-of-the-art Trump War Room” will strive to “uncover details of Trump’s affection for Russia and Putin.” They are tracking Trump’s foreign and domestic business partners, construction projects in foreign countries, and negotiations on potential future projects that he “could use to put personal profit ahead of our national security.” \nThe Beacon added that American Bridge also plans to get involved in 16-20 of the most competitive senate races for the 2018 midterms. It’s certainly something to keep an eye out on the periphery. Yet, if there’s one thong that we have learned throughout the 2016 cycle, it’s that Trump will surprise you—and that he usually comes out on top when everyone says that the chips are down for him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T13:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T08:41:06.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
