That happened to be Isac, who, presumably after screaming, “WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS?” loud enough for the entire city of Abilene to hear, told his mom about his horrifying discovery. She then ordered Isac to grab a shovel, which she promptly used to kill the giant fucking rattlesnake, right in front of Isac and everything. It was a teachable moment. \nFinding a giant fucking rattlesnake in your toilet is traumatic enough on its own. But then Mrs. Mcfadden rang up Nathan Hawkins, owner of the appropriately named “Big Country Snake Removal” business, who decided to conduct a thorough house inspection. Want to guess what he found? How about 23 additional living, breathing giant fucking rattlesnakes just HANGING OUT UNDERNEATH THEIR HOUSE AND OH DEAR GOD MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP. Hawkins removed all the snakes, per CBS News , and although the article didn’t mention anything about the nighttime habits of the Mcfadden family following the mass exodus of the scaly demons secretly living below their floorboards, it’s reasonable to assume that they haven’t slept a wink since.
