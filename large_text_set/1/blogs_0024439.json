He left the team to enlist in the army, citing the 9/11 attacks as the reason he walked away from a lucrative football career. His death in April 2004 was the subject of much controversy, as it was initially ruled that he was killed in an ambush. In 2007, however, the Army ruled that Tillman’s death was caused by friendly fire . \n[Marie Tillman image via screengrab/Pat Tillman image via US Army] \n– \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
