The woman’s husband, Ismael Guerrero, heard screams outside the house and ran out in an effort to pull Scarface off his wife. The dog then started to attack him, too. \nThe couple’s son, 22-year-old Antoine Harris, stabbed the canine in the neck and head -- and the dog attacked Harris, WFTS reported . \nThe dog got into the family’s home, where two children were in a back room. Tampa police called in Animal Control, which tried to tranquilize the dog. Tampa Police Department officers then used a stun gun and bean bag gun to subdue Scarface -- and Animal Control later captured the canine. \nThe Guerreros went to the hospital and had serious, but not life threatening, injuries. \nAs for Scarface, it remains unclear what will happen to him, WFTS reported.
