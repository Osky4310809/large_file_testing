Taking to Instagram to keep fans up to date, Drizzy dropped a photo of his under construction mansion, and it seems like Aubrey is very amped about it. A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Feb 17, 2017 at 6:43pm PST \nThe mansion has been designed by a man named Ferris Rafauli, the mastermind designer behind the Sher Club, Drake's exclusive members-only lounge at Toronto's Air Canada Centre. A post shared by Ferris Rafauli \"FR\" (@ferrisrafauli) on Oct 28, 2016 at 12:59pm PDT \nThe neighborhood of Toronto where Drake decided to build his dream home is one called The Bridle Path, located in a section of the city called North York. It is reportedly the most affluent neighborhood in Canada. Once upon a time, late musical legend Prince had a mansion there, too. \nDespite Drizzy's IG acclamation, the rapper is not currently in Toronto, but rather, on tour in Europe. Tomorrow night he will be performing in Dublin, Ireland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:50:16.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
