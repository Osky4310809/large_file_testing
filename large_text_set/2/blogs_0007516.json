Launched in 2012 by two best friends, Eric Prum and Josh Williams, the brand is dedicated to making durable products that will improve the time spent at your bar cart.\n\"We’re changing the food and beverage world, one idea at a time,\" the founders wrote on the website. \"Our mission? To bring new (sometimes crazy) products to life that will make your everyday encounters with food and drinks more approachable, more functional and, most importantly, more fun!\"\nIn July 2012, the duo launched a Kickstarter campaign for its four-piece mason jar shaker, which made over $74,000, and have gone on to create over 200 tools that simplify your dining, drinking, and entertaining experience. Products range from a classic cocktail muddler to a special ice tray that makes crushed ice for you, so it's a great place to buy the basics to bring your bartending skills to the next level.\nWhile there are many companies that make barware tools, W&P's products are hard to beat.
