What if an operator got a friend to order something, then, when her friend opened the door to get her package, the operator backed the bot away ever so slowly, so her friend had to lunge at the bot, and then, boom, the bot is rolling down the street while the operator is texting her friend, like, \"how bad do you want that wine?\"\nWhat I'm saying is I'd like to become one of these operators for a day or two.\nBONUS: Flame-throwing drones make for badass trash removers", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Technologies?src=hash", "https://www.starship.xyz/", "https://t.co/Drfz5fJ42j", "http://www.recode.net/2017/3/1/14782518/virginia-robot-law-first-state-delivery-starship", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/fyPsHyv1.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starship?src=hash", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ff98b4dcfdc8427c8ac212ee8d178fdf/virginia-could-soon-get-deliveries-cooler-sized-robots", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/robots?src=hash", "https://www.recode.net/2017/3/1/14782518/virginia-robot-law-first-state-delivery-starship", "https://twitter.com/reviewrounder/status/836541207035723780", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/fyPsHyv1.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-04T07:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:43:27.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
