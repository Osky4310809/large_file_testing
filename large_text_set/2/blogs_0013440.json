Since the free rides were scaled back late last year, Cohen said students have quit after-school programs and parents have scrambled to arrange pickups. \nAccording to our media partner The Baltimore Sun , Under Armour said it has been in discussions with city, state and community leaders since January to find a way to fill the funding gap. \n“One young woman described getting stuck miles away from her house and having to walk home through dark and dangerous streets,” Cohen tells The Sun . \nThere was even a bake sale held by the city council to raise part of the funds. \nThe one-time $100,000 cash infusion restores service for now, but it is not enough to keep rides free through next year, Cohen said. \nHe says the same business leaders and city, school and MTA officials will reconvene to find a long term solution. \nTo read the full article from The Baltimore Sun CLICK HERE .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:17:58.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
