'All the layers of history' \nIn October, perhaps the most dramatic moment in the renovation occurred when the cave thought to be the tomb of Jesus was opened for the first time in centuries. \nMarble slabs were removed to allow for the chamber's reinforcement. \nThey found a top slab dating from the era of the Crusades, indicating that the tomb had not been opened for 700 years, Moropoulou said.
