Joven Cagande \nMANILA, Philippines – Policemen raided the Islamic Center in Quiapo, Manila early yesterday morning and brought around 80 men, including seven minors, to the Manila Police District (MPD) headquarters, following reports of threats to the Feast of the Black Nazarene tomorrow. \nChief Insp. Jay Dimaandal, head of MPD’s District Special Operations Unit, said the police operation was part of the “regular Oplan Galugad” search operation. \nIt was National Capital Region Police Office chief Director Oscar Albayalde who ordered the conduct of Oplan Galugad in Muslim areas suspected as lairs of terrorist groups, including the detention cells occupied by Muslim groups in Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City. \nA police team riding in 20 police mobile cars, open vans and 6 x 6 trucks showed up at the Islamic Center along Carlos Palanca Street just across the Quiapo Church past 3 a.m. yesterday. \nAccording to MPD’s Station 8 commander Supt. Olivia Sagaysay whose team also joined the operation in the Muslim Center in Quiapo, raiding policemen were backed by 11 warrants of arrest and two search warrants. \nSenior Insp. Salvador Tangdol, head of MPD’s anti-illegal drugs unit, said the police arrested Loren Fahad alias Loren Datu-Haron y Dizon, 49, and Amir Hussein, 17, who were both living at the Islamic Center.   \nThe arrests were covered by a search warrant issued by Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 37 presiding judge Virgilio Macaraig. \nPolice also seized from Fahad and Hussein 16 sachets containing suspected shabu weighing around 80 grams, two weighing scales and a bundle of transparent plastic. \nThey will be subjected to an inquest for possible violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, according to Tangdol. \nPolice raiders also recovered an unlicensed caliber .45 pistol, a hand grenade and some 100 grams of shabu from other men brought to the MPD. \nThe MPD is still verifying the records of the 80 men they brought to headquarters since past 7 a.m. yesterday. Most of the men said they had nothing to do with any criminal activity in Quiapo, stressing they are only vendors. \nIn Camp Bagong Diwa, police raiders headed by NCRPO intelligence chief Senior Supt. Eleazar Matta raided the SICA 1 and SICA 2 detention facilities, where members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, Moro National Liberation Front and Moro Islamic Liberation Front are being detained. \nMatta told The STAR policemen searched for the cellphones of detainees who might have contact with terrorist groups outside the camp who are planning to conduct bombing runs during tomorrow’s Traslacion. \nEarlier, Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno said security threats from extremist groups like the Maute group and the Abu Sayyaf surfaced in relation to the Traslacion, or the traditional procession of the image of the Black Nazarene. Erap, MPD downplay apprehensions \nBut Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada yesterday downplayed apprehensions that terrorist elements would disrupt the Traslacion, saying the possibility of such attacks is “very minimal.” \nMPD director Chief Supt. Joel Coronel advised the public to calm down and not entertain any talk of terrorist activity. \nCoronel is the overall commander of the 6,000-strong combined police, military and civilian security force that will be deployed to the Traslacion. \nThe MPD will be backed up by force multipliers composed of barangay officials, paramedics, firefighters, traffic aides and non-governmental organizations. \n“Of course, we all agree that the threat exists regarding the possibility of a terror attack in any situation, including the Traslacion of the Black Nazarene. But is there a strong possibility or likelihood that such attacks will happen? Based on the assessment of our intelligence community, it is very minimal,” Coronel said. \nHe said if the threat is high, security officials would recommend the postponement of the Traslacion, which is expected to be attended by 18 million devotees. \nBut Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Governor Mujiv Hataman advised Manila’s security forces to consider all possibilities that he Abu Sayyaf and the Maute terror groups can disturb the Traslacion to ensure all its threats will be addressed. \nHataman also said it would be hypothetical for him to give assurance that movements of the terror groups can be thwarted down south and be prevented from going to Manila. Be vigilant too, devotees told \nPresidential spokesman Ernesto Abella advised Black Nazarene devotees to be vigilant too when practicing their faith by taking necessary precautions during the Traslacion. \nThe MPD reminded again the millions of Black Nazarene devotees not to bring backpacks during the procession to avoid being confronted by security officers. \nCoronel said prohibiting the use of backpacks is implemented during events attended by huge crowds because backpacks can be used to bring explosive materials and other dangerous contraband. \n“All you need is a hand towel or handkerchief and plastic water bottle,” he said. \n“We will check and we will not allow any person carrying backpacks to approach the Black Nazarene’s carrier and the procession,” he added. \nFor those who need to bring bags, they may deposit or leave them at the 10 command posts located in strategic points. \nCoronel also appealed to the public to cooperate to ensure a smooth and safe observance of the religious activity. \n“If you notice suspicious-looking persons or situations, please report it to any security personnel. We will go to them and check them,” he added. – With Jose Rodel Clapano, Non Alquitran, Roel Pareño, Christina Mendez, Mary Grace Padin  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:01:33.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
