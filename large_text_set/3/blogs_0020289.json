There is also disruption to Emmerdale tonight, although there is still an episode which will air at the earlier time of 6:45pm.\n\nCoronation Street often airs an additional episode on Thursdays so it’s likely that fans have already been paid back for this week’s missing episode but fear not, Corrie will soon be permanently upgraded to six visits a week meaning more action on the Street than ever before.\nSpeaking of which, the soap is about to become even more unmissable with huge storylines ahead for the Barlows as well as the return of Rob Donovan , a blast from the past for Sally and the next stage in killer Phelan’s plot .\nJust not tonight. Sorry.\nCoronation Street continues on Friday 24th March at 7:30pm and 8:30pm. Emmerdale continues on Wednesday 22nd March at 6:45pm. Both air on ITV. \nMORE: Coronation Street spoilers: Phelan’s next victim?
