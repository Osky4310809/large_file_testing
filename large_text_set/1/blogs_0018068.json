January 22, 2017, 8:08 PM Canadian   8:08 PM \nOTTAWA — Cam Atkinson’s second goal of the game at 1:09 of overtime gave the Columbus Blue Jackets a 7-6 win over the Ottawa Senators Sunday night. \nAtkinson had a breakaway after a shot by Senators captain Erik Karlsson missed the Columbus net and went around the boards out to Atkinson, who was at centre ice. \nThird-period goals by Lukas Sedlak at 1:50 and Matt Calvert at 2:21 erased a two-goal deficit for the Blue Jackets. Atkinson then scored at 10:50 to give Columbus a 6-5 lead. \nAtkinson’s shot was more of a pop-up in the infield after being deflected, but as Mike Condon tried to catch it above his head the puck hit his glove and went in. \nKyle Turris then tied the game 6-6 at 12:39 with the Senators on the power play. \nZack Smith and Mike Hoffman each scored twice for the Senators (25-15-5), with Mark Stone adding the other. Condon made 22 saves. \nNick Foligno, Scott Harrington and Zach Werenski also scored for the Blue Jackets (32-10-4). Joonas Korpisalo made 28 saves. \nThe two teams wasted no time once the puck dropped as there were three goals and three penalties before six minutes had run off the clock. \nSmith scored the game's first goal when he banked a shot off Korpisalo's pad and in at 42 seconds. \nJust 34 seconds later, and only 12 seconds after Cody Ceci took a hooking penalty, Foligno tied the game as he tipped an Alex Wennberg pass in behind Condon. \nSmith scored his second of the game at 5:33 on a redirection. Curtis Lazar picked up the second assist giving him his first point of the season in his 25th game. \nAfter a bit of a lull, Harrington scored his first goal of the season when his point shot eluded Condon at 10:18 and tied the game 2-2. \nThe second period wasn't as explosive to start as the first, but there was an opening-minute penalty to the Senators and a power-play goal by Werenski at 56 seconds to give the Blue Jackets a 3-2 lead. \nThe Senators were able to retake the lead before the end of the period as Hoffman and Stone scored at 10:41 and 13:08, respectively. Hoffman scored again at 19:43 to give the Senators a 5-3 lead after two periods. \nNotes: Casey Bailey and Mark Boroweicki were scratches for the Senators. Marcus Hannikainen, David Savard and Markus Nitivaara were scratches for the Blue Jackets. Senators forward Kyle Turris played in his 500th NHL game and became the 1,505th player in league history to reach that milestone. The Senators play the second of three consecutive home games when they host the Washington Capitals Tuesday. The Blue Jackets are in Brooklyn Tuesday to face the New York Islanders for the second of five straight road games. %2Fhockey%2Fnhl%2Fblue-jackets-escape-win-senators-13-goal-game%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T03:23:07.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
