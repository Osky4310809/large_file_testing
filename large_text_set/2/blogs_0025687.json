The agency said it cannot confirm its reported assessment on Kim Jong-nam's death. \nMalaysia hasn't directly accused North Korea of having masterminded the Kim Jong-nam killing but is pursuing several North Korean suspects, including a diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. \nPolice last week identified the substance as the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent, and Malaysia's health minister said on Sunday the dose was so high it caused \"very serious paralysis\" and killed him within 20 minutes. \nMalaysian officials have said four North Korean men provided the two women with the VX agent, then fled Malaysia the same day. \nIt was unclear if those four were the four North Korean spies cited by South Korea's intelligence agency. North Korea has repeatedly criticized Malaysia's investigation and has not acknowledged the victim's identity.
