I don’t think he should have been picked for that Test match,” Fleming told RSN. \n“Generally, even if you’ve been dropped, you’re still invigorated and you’re trying to get back in there. \n“I would be thinking for Nic Maddinson, ‘you would be having the rest of the summer off, and you need to clear your mind and you need to reset’. \n“If he’s in this frame of mind, he’s going into the game with no thoughts of enjoyment. He’s only seeing a negative outcome.” \nMaddinson was dismissed for a duck on debut, before registering scores of 1, 4 and 22 in innings against Pakistan. \nUnlike Peter Handscomb and Matt Renshaw who have maintained their places in the Test squad, Maddinson was dropped after three Tests for all-rounder Hilton Cartwright. \nThe left-hander was unable to recapture form in the Big Bash league, failing to register a big score for the Sydney Sixers in seven matches. \nHe made his Test debut after averaging 38 from 58 first-class games for NSW, with two tons and an 86 in the 2016-17 Sheffield Shield season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:46:11.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
