My friends went fancy, making burgers stacked with sauces and cheeses and, if I'm remembering correctly, an insane amount of bacon. My strategy was different: I went classic and homemade. I ground the beef, baked the brioche buns, and yes, reader—I fried homemade French fries.\nRelated The Chocolate Mousse It Took Patricia Wells a Lifetime to Perfect View article I tried to, anyway. After doing some research , I decided to go with the double-fry method. The logic of this method is that you fry the potatoes once to cook them through. Then, just before serving, you fry them a second time to get them crisp.\nThe fries were not a disaster. But they never reached hot, crunchy, French fry nirvana. So considering the hassle it was to fry them—twice!—I considered the experiment a fail. (Not unrelated: I didn't win that friendly competition, either.)\nBut now I'm wondering if the problem was that I wasn't making my French fries French enough. In her new cookbook, My Master Recipes , food writer and cooking teacher Patricia Wells offers a way to make homemade french fries at home that, she says, is \"neither brand-new nor unique,\" but that is nevertheless new to me. She calls her recipe \" 'Cold-Fry Frites .\"\nWhat it is, essentially, is a way to fry potatoes that mimics the way you would boil them. Cut the potatoes into fries, rinse and dry them (to remove excess starch), and put them in a pot. Cover the potatoes with oil, then turn the heat on high.\nJust as when boiling potatoes, starting the potatoes in cold oil cooks them from the inside-out. As the oil starts to boil (and you do want it to boil), the potatoes get creamy on the inside and golden and crunchy on the outside.\nWells adds just two caveats: 1. Don't use anything other than russets. 2. Don't use an aluminum pot, which won't be able to hold the oil's heat well enough.\nI might add a final caveat: 3. There's no need to reveal that this technique is old hat. As long as your guests aren't French, they'll never know you didn't invent it yourself.\nget this recipe", "external_links": ["https://www.amazon.com/Patricia-Wells/e/B000APS7I2"], "published": "2017-03-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:11:37.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
