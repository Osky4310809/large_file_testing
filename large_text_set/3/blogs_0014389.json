At Standard Innovation we take customer privacy and data security seriously.”\n“We have enhanced our privacy notice, increased app security, provided customers more choice in the data they share, and we continue to work with leading privacy and security experts to enhance the app.”\nThose who purchased a We-Vibe device, but did not use the app, will receive up to $199 through the settlement.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:21:10.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
