The Lugansk People’s Militia says the blast was a terrorist attack carried out by Kiev’s secret services. \n“The chief of the LPR People's Militia Office, Colonel Oleg Anashchenko, has died today in a terror act,” Maj. Andrey Marochko, the department’s representative, said at a press briefing on Saturday, as cited by RIA Novosti news agency.

Igor Pavlovsky, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, however, told the Ukrainian media that the step was provoked by actions from anti-Kiev forces. \nOn Thursday, the OSCE monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine published a damning report, claiming there had been a significant increase in ceasefire violations recorded in both the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The OSCE also documented the widespread use of multiple-launch rocket systems in Avdeevka, Yasynuvata, and Horlivka, with at least 10,330 explosions recorded within the past several days. \nAccording to investigators, the Ukrainian military, acting on the orders of senior commanders and officials from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, conducted heavy artillery attacks on several residential areas of the city of Donetsk and the suburban towns of Yasinovataya and Makeyevka on February 1, 2, and 3 this year. Three civilians died and 15 were wounded as a result of the shelling. \nThe attacks also damaged at least 60 residential buildings and civilian infrastructure facilities.The OSCE mission, however, claims both sides have been responsible for the suffering of local residents. #Donetsk : vulnerable civilians - pensioners, disabled - being evac'd from areas targeted by Ukrainian artillery.Also met a WW2-born couple pic.twitter.com/BCzy6eK2jI — Murad Gazdiev (@MuradGazdiev) February 3, 2017 \nOver 30 people were killed and more than 80 others, including 47 civilians, were injured in the DPR as a result of the violence so far this year, the republic’s Ombudsman’s Office spokesman said on Friday, as cited by Sputnik News. \nThe conflict in Ukraine’s Donbass began back in 2014, when people in Donetsk and Lugansk rejected the armed coup in Kiev, which saw then-President Viktor Yanukovich ousted and Petro Poroshenko's government installed. The new government eventually launched a military crackdown in eastern Ukraine, which led to a bloody conflict that has claimed over 10,000 lives to date, according to UN figures. \nIn February 2015, Kiev and authorities of the self-proclaimed republics signed a peace agreement in Minsk, known as the Minsk Accords. It stipulates a full ceasefire, heavy weapons withdrawal from the military contact line in Donbass, and constitutional reforms that would give both the LPR and DPR greater autonomy and special status.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T12:58:34.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
