Filming is expected to start in early 2017 for an October 12, 2018 release date, where First Man currently has no other competition. \nThe film is based on James Hansen’s biography “First Man: A Life Of Neil A. Armstrong,” which is described as follows: \nWhen Apollo 11 touched down on the moon’s surface in 1969, the first man on the moon became a legend. In First Man, Hansen explores the life of Neil Armstrong. Based on over fifty hours of interviews with the intensely private Armstrong, who also gave Hansen exclusive access to private documents and family sources, this “magnificent panorama of the second half of the American twentieth century” (Publishers Weekly, starred review) is an unparalleled biography of an American icon. \nUpon his return to earth, Armstrong was honored and celebrated for his monumental achievement. He was also—as James R. Hansen reveals in this fascinating and important biography—misunderstood. Armstrong’s accomplishments as engineer, test pilot, and astronaut have long been a matter of record, but Hansen’s unprecedented access to private documents and unpublished sources and his interviews with more than 125 subjects (including more than fifty hours with Armstrong himself) yield this first in-depth analysis of an elusive American celebrity still renowned the world over. \nIn a riveting narrative filled with revelations, Hansen vividly recreates Armstrong’s career in flying, from his seventy-eight combat missions as a naval aviator flying over North Korea to his formative transatmospheric flights in the rocket-powered X-15 to his piloting Gemini VIII to the first-ever docking in space. These milestones made it seem, as Armstrong’s mother Viola memorably put it, “as if from the very moment he was born—farther back still—that our son was somehow destined for the Apollo 11 mission.” \nFor a pilot who cared more about flying to the Moon than he did about walking on it, Hansen asserts, Armstrong’s storied vocation exacted a dear personal toll, paid in kind by his wife and children. For the forty-five years since the Moon landing, rumors have swirled around Armstrong concerning his dreams of space travel, his religious beliefs, and his private life. \nIn a penetrating exploration of American hero worship, Hansen addresses the complex legacy of the First Man, as an astronaut and as an individual. In First Man, the personal, technological, epic, and iconic blend to form the portrait of a great but reluctant hero who will forever be known as history’s most famous space traveler. \nOn the heels of their six-time Academy Award-winning smash, La La Land , Oscar-winning director Damien Chazelle and star Ryan Gosling reteam for Universal Pictures’ First Man , the riveting story of NASA’s mission to land a man on the moon, focusing on Neil Armstrong and the years 1961-1969. A visceral, first-person account, based on the book by James R. Hansen, the movie will explore the sacrifices and the cost—on Armstrong and on the nation—of one of the most dangerous missions in history. \nWritten by Academy Award winner Josh Singer ( Spotlight ), the drama will be produced by Wyck Godfrey & Marty Bowen ( The Twilight Saga , The Fault in Our Stars ) through their Temple Hill Entertainment banner, alongside Chazelle and Gosling. Isaac Klausner ( The Fault in Our Stars ) will executive produce. DreamWorks Pictures will co-finance the film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:21:25.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
