Some models cost well over $100, which is what inspired Ben Goldberg to look for an affordable alternative.\n\"I was feeling like I was getting ripped off by the cost of replacement brush heads,\" Goldberg told Business Insider. \"Then my electric toothbrush died, and I was faced with the decision of whether or not I wanted to spend over $100 on a new electric toothbrush.\"\nLast year, Goldberg and co-founder Claire Burke launched Goby , a direct-to-consumer company making electric toothbrushes for a fraction of the price of big name brands, like Philips and Oral-B.\nThere are tons of electric toothbrushes on the market, and I've tried several of them. If you're looking for one that won't completely kill your budget, I can't recommend the Goby's enough. The toothbrush has a bunch of cool features — an easy-to-use button, long battery life, and subtle notifications to remind you to brush a new quadrant — but the brush's strong head impressed me the most.\nCurrently, the brush is available in four fun colors. Goby\nGoby' s signature toothbrush has a rotationally oscillating brush head, which offers a deeper clean than other types of electric toothbrushes. Not only does the brush successfully clean all those hard-to-reach areas in the back of my mouth, I really like the strength of the oscillation.\nIt feels like my brush is literally scrubbing away plaque, stains, and food particles, which is something I can't say for the pricey toothbrush I used to use. As someone who really, really hates going to the dentist, I feel like I'm getting just as deep of a clean in my own bathroom, minus the mild discomfort.\nGoby's toothbrush costs $65 on its own, but you can save some money when you sign up for a subscription. The company will send you a new head for $6 each month and the brush will only cost $50. If you're looking for a new electric toothbrush that will actually show results, Goby is one of the best value options on the market right now.\nYou can order one of Goby's electric toothbrushes and/or sign up for a subscription here.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
