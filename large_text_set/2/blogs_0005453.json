I mean that in two different ways, of course. The first way is, well, just losing your composure. The second way is by snapping on Snapchat . \nKhloé Kardashian can relate to doing both of those activities simultaneously. The 32-year-old star went on a quick rant addressed to the haters who are constantly offering their little opinions on her workout regimen. Giphy \nAfter receiving waves of hate and criticism regarding her workout videos, the “Revenge Body” host took to Snapchat on February 5, saying, \nWhat bothers me so much about people is that I’m giving you guys my workouts on my snaps for free, so what the fuck? \nUh oh! It sounds like Khloé is NOT happy. Can you blame her? I mean, she’s not wrong. If you don’t appreciate the content she’s distributing for free to benefit you, just don’t follow her. \nJudging by Khloé’s heated rant, it seems like a few of her critics were pointing out the fact Khloé has unlimited access to the right trainers and fitness equipment and they don’t. \nKhloé countered that argument, saying, \nWhy the fuck are you still complaining and saying, ‘If I had a trainer, if I had a gym’ Well, I don’t have a gym. We’re doing everything outside. I’m showing you guys how to do the workouts so you don’t need a trainer. I’m using everything that I’m sure you guys have around the house. Or improvise! What the fuck?! \nHmm, I totally understand where Khloé’s coming from, but I think she made need to hit the gym and take out some of that pent-up aggression on the weights and cables!

But to all the ones who the ones who appreciate my snaps, I love you and God bless. \nAnd the award for the most brutally honest Kardashian goes to… Khloé Kardashian! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
