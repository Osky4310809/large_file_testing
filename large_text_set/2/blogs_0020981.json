By Robert Purchese   \nAfter weeks of speculation, the Numbani Overwatch story event - which we expect will introduce one, if not two new heroes to the game - has begun. The Doomfist gauntlet has been stolen. \nOn the Public Test Realm, the Numbani map has changed. The airport starting area for the Attack team has been trashed following \"a major confrontation\" that ties into a picture piece of lore tweeted on Friday by the Overwatch Twitter account. [BREAKING] OR15 defense units destroyed in confrontation with unidentified assailant at Numbani airport. No civilian casualties reported. pic.twitter.com/3XuXbCCugh â€” Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) February 24, 2017 \nMore importantly, the Doomfist gauntlet is missing from the Numbani payload. \nThe tweeted lore picture is taken by Efi Oladele, the 11-year-old girl genius we were introduced to recently . It shows us the OR15 defense robots, albeit destroyed. One, particularly has been flung with such force into the wall it has produced a kind of crater. \nWho could do such a thing? The game's main villainous force, Talon, employs Reaper, Widowmaker and Sombra, when willing. None of those characters have abilities capable of a forceful smash. But the Doomfist gauntlet is said to have that kind of power... \nBut if it were a Talon attack, why wouldn't fictional Overwatch news network Atlas label it a 'terrorist attack' as it has done other Talon attacks? They are fairly commonplace; Talon has been the main enemy as long as the game has been going. Why does VR give some people motion sickness? Why it happens and how to avoid it. \nWe don't know when the Numbani changes will carry over to live Overwatch servers, but there is maintenance scheduled for tomorrow, Pancake Day. There is even the tenuous suggestion that timings will coincide with Paris Fashion Week , which begins 28th February, ends 8th March. It's to do with a poster on the walls of Numbani. The idea is that the new content will hit PTR 28th February and then launch 8th March. \nIf Blizzard were to go whole hog and drop a new hero reveal package tomorrow - hero plus lore trailer plus animated short - it would be a marked departure from the ARG build up Sombra had before launch. It would be a relief. \nDo bear in mind that a new Overwatch hero will likely spend at least a week on the Public Test Realm before going live. \nWho are the new heroes? One we expect to be Doomfist, perhaps voiced by Terry Crews - it would be a missed opportunity if not. The other? We simply don't know. Water has been poured on the robo-spider idea, although the idea of something robotic, something connected to Efi Oladele, still stands.
