Last week, Joe Adams, a junior at Michigan State University, was tagged in a post in a Facebook group. Someone in his class was helping their roommate find a date to a formal, and Adams realized this was his chance.\nHe commented on the post with an enthusiastic \"I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT,\" and added his dating résumé. It's really more of a work of art.\nImage: joe adams\nIt's similar to a professional résumé, in that he lays out his education and career info—he's a lubricants consultant, which he is careful to explain is \"not a euphemism.\" He lists his skills (crying during Marley & Me , replying to long texts) and some \"moderately interesting\" personal factoids (\"has never lost a Snapchat streak,\" \"makes great small talk with parents\"). He even gives a detailed breakdown of how he spends his time (\"academic grind,\" \"Facetiming with my mom\"). Are you googling him yet?\nWhy on earth did Adams have such a well-designed resume ready to go in this particular moment? He told Buzzfeed he'd been chatting up a girl earlier in the semester and when he asked her out, “She asked if I had a dating résumé that she could look at, and when I said no (like any normal person would) she told me no.\" So he decided to make something funny in case that ever happened again.\nUNREAL EFFORT BY THIS KID 12/10 RESUME pic.twitter.com/TlzfF0FV9y\n— Simone Campbell (@simonecampbelll) March 15, 2017\nLo and behold, it has paid off. Though he didn't get asked to go to the formal (a major misstep, in our opinion), his resume hit Twitter not long after he posted it. Turns out, plenty of people are interested in a man who puts in the effort.\nOkay but he's actually my dream guy https://t.co/fX9te8tyhF\n— Cait (@CaitlinRobison) March 16, 2017\nAdams told us this morning that he's been overrun with options. \"I've gotten invited to both formals and weddings. It's pretty overwhelming since I have an exam today, and my phone has been blowing up non-stop for the last week.\" But he's appreciating his newfound fame: \"The coolest part about this experience has been connecting with people all over the globe and being able to share a laugh.\"\nNow he just needs to update his career résumé to include his new title, \"king of the internet.\"\nWATCH: Adorable kid struggling to stay awake while eating is all of us on a Monday", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BYTHZEMSO09L33vr3VqBrB1ofy4=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419598%2F1b707f68-e924-4e66-828c-42f31f04467d.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/fxR8JC1s.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/fxR8JC1s.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/simonecampbelll/status/842085057607139330", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliareinstein/dating-resume?utm_term=.rgQ4vQMVB#.dxJP6rN4B", "https://twitter.com/CaitlinRobison/status/842406569446932480", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/c6fFdJWZ40fFDjoiyHMP7Dn1kso=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F419598%2F1b707f68-e924-4e66-828c-42f31f04467d.jpg", "https://t.co/fX9te8tyhF", "https://t.co/TlzfF0FV9y"], "published": "2017-03-20T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:31:19.675+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
