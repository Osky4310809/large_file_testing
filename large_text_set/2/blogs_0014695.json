McMaster wrote definitive book on Vietnam/gov micromanaging war from DC https://t.co/jiQnaYpHgZ \n— Evan Siegfried (@evansiegfried) February 20, 2017 A first step, but deeply reassuring. Good luck to McMaster in getting control of the process.

But here's a question: Will he influence Trump and Trumpism? Or be influenced by them? Thx for your service, Gen. \n— Jay Nordlinger (@jaynordlinger) February 20, 2017 Based on what I'm reading, trying to figure out why McMaster wasn't NSA from the outset instead of Flynn. \n— Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) February 20, 2017 1/ So, the news is that Trump has select Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster as his new National Security Advisor. This is interesting… (thread) \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 2/ It's interesting to those of us familiar (even generally) with Pentagon gossip because LTG McMaster is widely respected… \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 3/ …in part because LTG McMaster, throughout his career, is known to powerfully question conventional wisdom and the status quo. \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 4/ In a way, McMaster is Trump's siamese opposite. Both question the status quo, but only McMaster is consistently right in doing so. \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 5/ McMaster is known for bucking the system in a responsible manner that has won him backlash from his senior officers in the past. \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 6/ For example, despite his dazzling record, he was twice passed over for promotion to brigadier general because he didn't \"go with things\". \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 7/ SO… here's the million dollar question: Trump is a colossal nightmare who fucks up constantly. McMaster is a renowned professional… \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 8/ …who isn't afraid to challenge his superiors. What's going to happen between these two in the Situation Room? \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 9/ This is all to say that I am incredibly relieved–thrilled even–that LTG McMaster has been selected as the National Security Advisor. \n— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) February 20, 2017 Interesting, from McMaster's book Dereliction of Duty.
