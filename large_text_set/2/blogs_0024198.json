Kevin Winter / Getty Images \nO'Connell, 59, was recognized for his work on the Mel Gibson war movie \"Hacksaw Ridge.\" \n\"I can't even tell you the experience it was for me,\" O'Connell said backstage after the victory in the best sound/sound mixing category. \"As much as I thought I knew what it would feel like [to win an Oscar] I didn't. It was the greatest feeling in my entire life.\" \nO'Connell admitted he had grown accustomed to his losing streak. \"I wasn't expecting it to happen,\" he said. \nSpeaking to NBC News in the run up to Sunday's awards, O'Connell admitted that he had \"been called the Susan Lucci of the Academy Awards,\" referring to the actress who played the devious Erica Kane on the long-running soap opera \"All My Children\" and needed 19 tries before she finally took home an Emmy. \nHis win was a modest upset, as many pundits had pegged musical \"La La Land\" to waltz off with the prize. \nO'Connell will share the Oscar win with Andy Wright, Robert Mackenzie, and Peter Grace. It's the first Oscar for all four men. \nBorn on Long Island and raised in Los Angeles, O'Connell's dream as a child was to be a firefighter — not a sound mixer , whose job is to record all the sound recorded on the set while a movie is being made.
