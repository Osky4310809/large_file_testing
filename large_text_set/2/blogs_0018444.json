She said she has not been able to find out whether her relatives’ sites were disturbed because the cemetery’s phone line has been inundated with calls.\nRegardless, she said such a hateful act still directly affects her. “This desecration is a devastating thing to happen to anybody’s family,” she told TIME on Wednesday. “It was particularly devastating for me personally. These are beloved family members.”\nPerle and others who have loved ones buried at the cemetery say they’re deeply touched by the online fundraiser, organized by two Muslim-Americans, which has been collecting an average of $1,000 every 20 minutes.\nThe donation page was started by Muslim advocate Linda Sarsour and Tarek El-Messidi , who also founded CelebrateMercy, a nonprofit that teaches about Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam.\n“We just want to send a message that whatever haters and extremists try to destroy, we will rebuild,” El-Messidi, 36, told TIME. “Seeing this happen was just disgusting. It shows that when you put all the politics aside, we share humanity together. We want everyone to live in peace and we want everyone to rest in peace.”\nAndy Ulrich, whose grandparents are also buried at the cemetery, called the vandalism a “day of darkness” and said the collaboration between Jews and Muslims, who are often presented in opposition , sheds light on a message of unity.\n“I always say it takes something horrible to bring out the best in Americans,” he said. “I think that there’s more similarity in people than differences.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:35:48.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
