Akshay Kumar, who has often extended monetary help to those in need (including his ailing friend Ravi Shrivastava , and martyr jawan Gurnam Singh's family ), once again stepped up and donated Rs. 9 lakhs to each of the martyr's families. That's a grand total of Rs. 1.08 crore. \nAccording to a report, Amit Lodha, DIG of Jaisalmer sector north, said, \"Akshya himself has been in touch with me, and he keeps enquiring about the incidents. And when I told him about the Sukma incident he immediately told me he would like to contribute and do his bit for the families of the martyred jawans , we are all grateful to him for this kind gesture.\" \nAkshay Kumar was reported saying, \"They are decorated with lots of medals, and that is good. But, I looked at their faces. The samman (honour) was required for them but they need money too. You have to be practical.\" \nNow, that's a lesson in humility and generosity we can all learn from!
