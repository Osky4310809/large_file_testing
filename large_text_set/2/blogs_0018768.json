Where the AMG GT was built from a modified SLS AMG platform, the upcoming four-door version is rumoured to adopted the modular, rear-drive MRA architecture instead. \nThe AMG GT4 aims to take on the sleeker-roofed, high-performance four-door establishment which includes the likes of the Porsche Panamera , BMW M6 Gran Coupe and the Audi RS7 ; the new Mercedes is tipped to be the successor to the CLS Shooting Brake . \nFollowing its expected Geneva debut in March, the production-ready GT4 is rumoured to reach the European market next year, in line with earlier estimates of a 2018 debut. As with the two-seater GT , the GT4 is expected to be available in two variants; a standard model and an ‘S’ version, the latter tipped to surpass the 600 hp of the Mercedes-AMG E 63 S . \nThat output advantage could possibly come from an integrated starter generator (ISG), which is tipped to take residence in the GT4’s transmission for temporary boosts of 20 hp, drawing power from a 48V electrical system; the production model could also feature a lithium-ion battery of “moderate size.” AMG’s 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 could also be joined by Mercedes’ new 3.0 litre inline-six , also with ISG assistance. \nGALLERY: Mercedes-AMG GT C Coupe Mercedes-AMG GT C Edition 50, graphitgrau magno, Fahraufnahme ;Kraftstoffverbrauch kombiniert: 11,3 l/100 km, CO2-Emissionen kombiniert: 257 g/km Mercedes-AMG GT C Edition 50, graphite grey magno, driving shot; Fuel consumption combined: 11.3 l/100 km; Combined CO2 emissions: 257 g/km Research Mercedes-Benz Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:19:26.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
