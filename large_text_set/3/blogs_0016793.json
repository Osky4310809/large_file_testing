Maybe you got down on yourself today. Maybe you wallowed when you could've worked. Maybe you compared yourself to the billion and one other people who have something you want—a sure way to feel like dirt. \nBut none of that matters now. \nWhat matters is what you choose to focus on before you go to bed, before your subconscious plays with your most powerful thoughts and experiences for eight hours. What thoughts will those be? \nI'm choosing to think of the moments when I made myself feel proud. I'm going to magnify that feeling with my mind, and I'm going to make it so powerful that my subconscious can't resist it as I sleep. That way I'll be thinking positively when I awake, and I'll be training my brain as I sleep. \nI'm going to choose the experiences that made me feel grateful. And if I missed out on actually feeling gratitude for something or someone important, I'll give myself that opportunity before bed. ADVERTISEMENT \nI'll recognize where I came up short, but I won't dwell on that. Instead, I'll think of the amazing things I can do tomorrow to improve myself, my relationships, my career, and all the things I can control. But the past isn't one of those things. \nSo, to everyone who's feeling down, cheer up. Focus on things you did right, even if the day was a loss. Focus on the people who make your life worth living. And generate the positive thoughts and feelings that you want your day to be defined by tomorrow. \nIf by some glitch in the matrix you didn't accomplish anything you'd feel proud about, change that before you fall asleep. Take notes on a chapter in your latest self-improvement book. Write a thank-you card to someone who's been there for you. Meditate, and visualize the success you wish to achieve in life and love. Draft a knockout cover letter for the position you've dreamed of applying for. Make your bed, even if it's five minutes before you hop back in it. Do a 10-minute workout, or a yoga session. Inch, scrape, and crawl toward the better life you have in mind. \nYou'll adopt the mindset that it's never too late to give your best effort, and that your best effort is always a good option. You're worth that. \nBesides, the alternative isn't exactly appealing. \nYou can wallow a bit more, wishing you were somewhere you weren't, regretting the things you haven't done, fearing the life you might not get to live, accomplishing nothing. And as you drift off to sleep, your subconscious will ruminate on those disempowering thoughts. The thoughts will fester. And breed with each other. And occupy more and more of your mind so that by the time you wake up, you feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders, and that a dark cloud has obscured your vision, smothering your joy. You can do that. But it's not really what you want. \nYou want an inspired life where every breath counts, where more of your dreams come true every day, and where you make a difference to more people. That kind of life is the product of a positive mindset. And to attain it, you have to reset your mind every night before you go to bed. 1. Focus on something you accomplished today. \nRelive the experience, feeling the encouragement and confidence as if it were happening now. Magnify those feelings. 2. Feel gratitude—especially for the people in your life. \nThink about the top five people who've made your life what it is, then relive an experience that made you grateful for them. Think about the lucky breaks in your life. Choose any number of minor miracles to feel grateful for, and keep feeding that feeling of gratitude. 3. Visualize. \nProject into the future the positive feelings you've generated. See yourself accomplishing things that you've put off for weeks or months. Feel the pride coursing through your body, swelling up your heart. And express gratitude in advance for your achievements. 4. Plan. \nBrainstorm three critical goals that will bring you closer to the life you want to live tomorrow and write them down. The act of writing down your goals makes them more concrete and makes you less likely to avoid them. It also gives your sleeping brain the opportunity to create solutions for obstacles that stand in the way. 5. Read. \nRead something inspiring, and useful, and imaginative, and relevant to the struggles you're going through. Prefer a self-improvement book with oodles of ideas to test in your own life. Prefer an actual book over digital—the blue light from screens interferes with your melatonin production and sleep cycle. \nReading programs your mind to think in terms of solutions, not obstacles. \nAnytime you feel down, and especially before bed, use these five steps to encourage a restorative, refreshing, growth-oriented perspective.
