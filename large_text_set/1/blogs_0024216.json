There is no justification for what is happening. President Trump has signed an order that in effect bans people from entering the US based on their birthplace and their religion. I won’t say that we are better than this, because clearly we’re not. I won’t say that this is unprecedented, because that’s simply not true. I will however say that this is not who we should be. I will say that we should do everything we can to fight and reverse the presidential order as fast as we can. And I will say that this should be the last and final time we allow something like this to happen. It is besides the point that our industry is full of immigrant founders, innovators, inventors and leaders, because an extraordinary achievement is not a prerequisite for staying alive. It is besides the point that our company was built by immigrants, because we don’t need to to tie this back to us for it to be real. It is besides the point that our colleagues and friends will be affected by this order, because our connection to them is not what makes their suffering valid. It is besides the point that this is week one and that if we don’t stand up now, we will be next, because we don’t need to be in harms way to stop others from being harmed. It is besides the point that all religions tell us to stand up for those in need because we should not need to point to scripture to do the obvious right thing. It is besides the point that those that don’t resist are clearly on the wrong side of history, because we shouldn’t need to picture ourselves as future heroes to preserve human dignity. It is besides the point that we can name close family members that were immigrants, because we don’t need to cite personal experience to fight an injustice. It is besides the point that this is unconstitutional, because the constitution is flawed like any document and we shouldn’t need to refer to it when we want to stop people dying. It is besides the point that the people affected by the presidential order come from countries that have no historic ties to acts of terrorism in the US, because even if they did, we shouldn’t punish people for the acts of other people that happen to be born within the same imagined borderline. It is besides the point that this has all happened before, and that we can’t unhypocritically point to those past injustices and proudly say #neveragain and at the same time ignore the wrong that is happening before our eyes right now. The only thing that matters is that these are people. Human beings that need our help. Human beings that have all the same rights as we and deserve the possibility of peace, love and happiness. Human beings that have their fears, faults, hopes and dreams. Ueno is a small company and we have a small voice but we will do everything in our power to fight this injustice. Our first act will be to donate $25k to help refugees in Syria. We are talking with other people in tech and design to try and bring other people in our industry in to this donation so we can raise additional funds from likeminded people. More on that in the next few days (if you are interested in joining this effort, please email me at h@ueno.co). But again, lets keep this simple. There is no justification for what is happening. And there is no justification for keeping silent. Speak up now, your voice matters and your silence screams.
