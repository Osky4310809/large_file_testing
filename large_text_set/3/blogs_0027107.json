(Edward Lee) \nMadarasz, who entered this season with a .511 career faceoff percentage (161 of 315), has struggled thus far, claiming only 38.3 percent of his draws (46 of 120) with 18 ground balls. But Pietramala declined to anoint Moreland as the primary faceoff specialist for Saturday’s game against No. 15 Virginia (5-3) and redshirt junior Jason Murphy (58.7 percent on 91 of 155, 16 ground balls). \n“We have to have all hands on deck,” Pietramala said. “Craig had some success the year prior. … Things unfold in a game, and you’ve got to be ready and adjust and use different people. We were prepared to do that with Hunter in the Syracuse game, and we’ll be prepared to do that with all of them in this game. We’ve got to have every single one of them ready.” \nThe Johns Hopkins men's lacrosse team lost to the Syracuse Orange on Saturday, March 18; it was their third straight loss.
