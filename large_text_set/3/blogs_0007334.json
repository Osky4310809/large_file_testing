Secrets on how the CIA hacked devices made by Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft are now available for all to see. But should you start freaking out just yet? \nCult of Mac talked to a number of iOS security experts to make sense of all the new info. While it’s tempting to panic, there’s a lot more you need to know first. What is ‘Year Zero’? \n“Year Zero” is a series of 8,761 documents and files obtained by WikiLeaks that allegedly came from a secret network at CIA headquarters. WikiLeaks claims it is “the largest intelligence publication in history.” What’s in the leaked documents? Information on all of the tools the CIA uses to hack smartphones, computers and even televisions. The documents reveal new exploits that companies like Apple and Google apparently didn’t know about. The CIA supposedly kept some of those vulnerabilities secret from the companies involved, despite a promise to the contrary from the Obama administration. Can someone use the leaked CIA tools to hack my iPhone? \nIt doesn’t look like it. So far there hasn’t been any information found in the data dump that would effect someone running an iPhone or iPad with the most recent version of iOS. Should I be worried? \nMaybe, but probably not. There is still a ton of data to go through. Hackers we have talked to so far told us they’ve seen no new zero day vulnerabilities for iOS in the documents. (There might be some for Windows, though.) Most of the of the vulnerabilities described are old ones that can’t be implemented. But I read that the CIA hacked all the messaging apps? \nNot really. The CIA found a way to bypass the encryption of apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, Confide and Cloakman by hacking the encryption of the smartphone they run on. If your iPhone hasn’t been owned by the CIA, then you’re OK. Who would want the leaked info? \nThe CIA’s enemies . By leaking the CIA’s hacking arsenal, WikiLeaks just revealed to foreign government agencies how the CIA approaches hacking tradecraft. Hacker groups and others will probably be pretty stoked for the data dump, too. Why is the leak a big deal? \nBecause it reveals that the CIA has massive hacking capabilities that rival the National Security Agency. It also shows that the CIA has been dishonest with companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google. In 2008, the Obama administration promised it would disclose serious software vulnerabilities so they could be fixed. Instead, the CIA hoarded the exploits. Has anything shady been going on? \nIt’s the U..S government, so yeah. According to notorious NSA leaker Edward Snowden , the WikiLeaks documents reveal that the government developed vulnerabilities for U.S. products — then intentionally left the holes open so they could exploit them later. Who has the CIA been hacking? \nIt’s hard to tell exactly who the CIA targeted with its tools. WikiLeaks redacted the names of ten of thousands of targets and attack machines throughout the United States, Europe and Latin America. One document reveals that the CIA even hacks its own double agents . How many hackers does the CIA have? \nMore than 5,000 users are registered in the CIA’s hacking division. The team has produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses and malware. Because team members don’t need to go through the NSA to get hacking tools, they have very little public oversight. What kind of hacking tools did the CIA create?What can I do to defend myself? \nKeep iOS and macOS updated with the latest software fixes. Don’t use unnecessary apps . Avoid becoming a target of the CIA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:20:06.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
