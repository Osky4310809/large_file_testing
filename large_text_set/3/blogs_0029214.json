This project began shortly after the game’s release. At the time, the programmers believed it would take months to get the game running properly. This makes sense given all of the different mechanics within the game. As you’ll see, the group has made tremendous progress since then.\nThis is all possible thanks to a program called CEMU, which allows Wii U games to run on PC. In the beginning, the group was only able to show the game’s opening cave. Now, there is more of the game to show off. As you can see, it runs almost as well as it does on Wii U. While this emulated Breath of the Wild suffers from frame rate drops, so does the Wii U version. Minor hitches aside, the team has done an impressive job porting the game over so far.\nCEMU is funded through Patreon. It has gained many backers in the last two weeks. At the beginning of the month, CEMU had 1857 backers donating a collective $7782 a month. It now has 5135 backers who are donating $22k a month. Backers gain early access to the latest versions of CEMU. Patrons will get Version 1.7.7 on April 2, while the public will get it on April 9.\nWhile this is all extremely impressive, we know how this story usually ends. Nintendo could easily pull the plug on this game the instant it goes live. However, there are still groups out there running Nintendo games on PC via programs like the Dolphin emulator. Will this version of Breath of the Wild suffer the same fate as AM2R and Pokemon Uranium ? Who knows? But if it does manage to be released, it will ironically enough be the best version of the game.\nWant to learn more? Here’s everything you need to know about the Nintendo Switch .\nBuy it now!
