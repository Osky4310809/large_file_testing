But how would one make an actual version of the movie hamburger?\nChef and filmmaker Andrew Rea recreated of the Big Kahuna Burger in an episode of his web series Binging with Babish . Rea actually improves upon the sad-looking burger from the movie by including a toasted Hawaiian roll, two smash-burger patties topped with Monterey Jack cheese, caramelized onions, caramelized pineapples, ketchup, and teriyaki sauce. It looks waaaay more tasty than a Quarter Pounder with cheese and even a fancy Royale with cheese.\nJust add a Red Apple cigarette and you’ll be working for Marsellus Wallace in no time. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:48:16.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
