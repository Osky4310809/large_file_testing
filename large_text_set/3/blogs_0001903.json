But DND spokesman Daniel Le Bouthillier said the office of Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson confirmed the Conflict of Interest Act doesn’t prevent Turner from taking the new job.\n“The Department of National Defence has no concerns with Mr. Turner’s upcoming employment,” said Le Bouthillier. “We are satisfied that all appropriate steps were taken prior to accepting the position and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavours.”\nTurner leaves his job at DND on March 17 and reports for work at PAL on April 3 as vice-president of operations.\nBut Turner’s direct move from the department to a firm involved in a multi-billion dollar contract with his organization has raised eyebrows in Canada’s defence industry, which has its share of retired military officers and DND staff.\nThe awarding of the fixed-wing search-and-rescue contract to Airbus is currently being challenged in Federal Court by the losing bidder, the Italian aerospace firm Leonardo, which claims the contract was awarded unfairly.\nSources say Leonardo still has yet to decide whether to use Turner’s new job with PAL in its legal arguments.\nRelated Losing bidder for new search-and-rescue aircraft takes Canadian government to court National Post View: The military is an instrument of national policy, not Liberal vanity Leonardo’s legal action aims to have the court overturn the award of the contract Airbus. It has argued that the Airbus plane, the C295W, is more costly than its C-27J aircraft and cannot adequately fulfill search-and-rescue missions, particularly in the Arctic.\nNicolas Boucher, a spokesman for Public Services and Procurement Canada, said the department can’t comment on the Airbus contract because the case is before the courts, but said a fairness monitor was used on the aircraft procurement and did not report any issues.\nIn a statement Airbus noted it is limiting its comments because of the legal case but pointed out its aircraft meets all the requirements Canada established.\nLe Bouthillier said Turner followed all guidelines under the Conflict of Interest Act, which included disclosing the job offer to the commissioner. “It is worth noting Public Services and Procurement Canada oversees the bid evaluation of the process, and that PAL worked with Airbus directly, not with the government of Canada, on FWSAR,” he said. “Consequently, as Associate Deputy Minister at DND, Mr. Turner did not have any role in the evaluation that led to the selection of the Airbus DS proposal.”\nLe Bouthillier noted it was Airbus, not the government, which selected PAL as its partner to service the new planes.\nSteve Dinn, PAL’s vice president, said the company is looking forward to Turner’s arrival at the firm’s St. John’s office. “We look forward to John’s leadership as we continue our focus on export and international growth opportunities,” Dinn said.\n• Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:39:57.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
