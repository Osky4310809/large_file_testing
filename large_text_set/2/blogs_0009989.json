Those images, plus thirty others, never executed, were intended for a publication that was never realized. Washington Crossing the Delaware, the tenth panel of the series, depicts war-weary soldiers of Washington's army huddle under blankets in three small rowboats in December 1776. Standing at the helm (at lower left) is their leader, his head and back bent stalwartly into the oncoming wind.
