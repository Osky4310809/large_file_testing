The weather this February keeps getting weirder. At a time when Arctic blasts usually sweep across the nation and Northern states are covered in snow and ice, historically warm air has flooded the eastern two-thirds of the nation.\nAll-time February record high temperatures are falling and the air feels more like early May.\nA stunning 2,805 record high temperatures have occurred across the nation this month compared to just 27 record lows.\nThe warmest air with respect to normal has focused on the Midwest and, in some areas, it’s unlike anything they’ve ever witnessed.\nFlower stems are sprouting in Chicago, and the Great Lakes are practically ice-free. In an area normally thick in ice, “a boat was seen skimming over the calm waters of Lake Michigan on Monday afternoon,” CBS Chicago reported .\nChicago set record highs on four straight days between Friday and Monday, complementing a dizzying number of other warm weather milestones. Before Sunday, when it was 70, it had reached 70 only three other times in records dating to 1871. Then it hit 70 again Monday. And it could hit 70 once more Wednesday.\nIn other words, half of Chicago’s February 70-degree days in recorded history are likely to occur in this one astonishingly warm week.\n(National Weather Service) Chicago’s forecast high in the mid-70s Wednesday may flirt with its warmest February temperature on record of 75 from Feb. 27, 1976.\n“The NORMAL high in Chicago does not reach 70 degrees until May 15th, which underscores how unusual this warmth truly is,” explained WGN’s weather blog .\nOther Midwestern cities are also basking in the unusual warmth and the highest temperatures are likely still to come.\nAfter setting several daily record highs over the past few days, Madison and Milwaukee are both forecast to set their all-time February high temperatures Wednesday:\nAll-time record highs for February likely to be broken on Wednesday at MKE and MSN. https://t.co/Iz9PkINQOy #swiwx pic.twitter.com/5o5KfiXcqu\n— NWS Milwaukee (@NWSMKX) February 21, 2017\n“Only twice in 130 years in Green Bay have we seen February temps reach 60 degrees. The forecast calls for two this week,” tweeted Jeff Last , a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Green Bay.\nNational Weather Service forecast highs on Wednesday. Highs that are predicted within one-degree of a record high are circled. (WeatherBell.com) The record warmth predicted for Wednesday will put an exclamation mark on the warm stretch which began late last week. Here are some more of the notable records which have already been set:\nLa Crosse, Wis., tied its all-time February record high of 65 on Sunday Moline, Ill., set its all-time February record high of 74 on Sunday Omaha, Neb., set daily record highs on Thursday, Friday and Sunday St. Cloud, Minn., tied its all-time February record highs of 59 Saturday Milwaukee and Detroit just missed, by one degree, tying all-time February record highs Saturday Scores of daily record highs were set between Wednesday and Monday from Denver to Philadelphia. Weather.com has a good recap . Lack of snow and ice\nSnow and ice levels are near historic lows thanks to the warm weather.\nSnow covered a mere 16.5 percent of the Lower 48 states Tuesday morning, the second lowest amount since NOAA began keeping records in 2004. Only last year’s 16.1 percent, on this date, was lower.\n[ America’s year without a winter: The 2015-2016 season was the warmest on record ]\nSnow cover on Feb. 21. (NOAA) On average, a third of the nation has snow cover on this date. And in the snowy winters of 2010 and 2013, snow blanketed about half the nation.\nThis year, few locations outside Maine, northern North Dakota, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Mountain West have appreciable snow cover.\nOn Wednesday, Chicago will log its 67th straight calendar day without receiving one inch of snow, its longest such snow drought on record.\n(Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory) Meanwhile, the Great Lakes have precious little ice. As of Feb. 20, ice covered just 8.1 percent of the Great Lakes compared to normal coverage of around 42 percent.\nRecord warmth across the Great Lakes means thin ice! Stay off the ice! #WIwx #LakeMichigan pic.twitter.com/0hF4mheR7y\n— WeatherNation (@WeatherNation) February 21, 2017\nWinter to return?\nWednesday will be the last unusually mild day in the Midwest, until next week at least, as a storm winds up over the Plains Thursday and then races through southeast Minnesota into the Great Lakes Friday and Saturday.\nGFS model simulation of storm cutting from the Plains into the Great Lakes Thursday and Friday. (PivotalWeather.com) The storm will bring accumulating to Minneapolis and drag a strong cold front across the region. Much cooler air will spill into the region so that areas that were in the 60s on Wednesday will only be in the 30s on Saturday.\nIts 60 degrees at MSP right now, and in 60 hours it will be snowing.
