Glittery undercut tattoos and vibrant, hidden roots are just a few examples of the clever, crafty coifs that stylists have come up with, but most recently, we're impressed by Janine Ker of Salon Aguayo 's stenciled styles. \nWe first spotted Ker's work in January, when we showcased her in a story about inspiring beauty-based Instagram accounts . For her stencil work, the mane maven seems to first sketch out a design then bring it to life on her clients' heads. She's created everything from polka dots to lotus blossoms on hair, but we're particularly impressed by the garden of flowers she imprinted into one woman's strands. \nThe best part? The color is temporary! Ker shared that she's used Joico InstaTint Temporary Color Shimmer Spray ($10) to spray festive flair onto hair. Getting a cool new look is as easy as designing graffiti art. Read on and see her mesmerizing work for yourself!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T06:06:00.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
