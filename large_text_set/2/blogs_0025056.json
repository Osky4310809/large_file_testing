Now he wants to retire a Vikings. \nTranslation: There is no market out there for AP, and he knows the Vikings are his only real shot at another decent contract. Only the Vikings would overpay him because of what he’s meant to the franchise. Every other team could find a RB off the scrap heap and pay him way less for better production. Funny how much leverage/lack-thereof has changed AP’s tune.

Oh wait, never mind. rtl1984 says: Feb 23, 2017 2:44 PM \nThanks for the years A.D. Us Viking fans loved you, you had a lot of great runs and you’re certainly a HOFer. But, with no O-line and a huge price tag and missing 2/3’s of the last 3 seasons…I doubt he’ll be a Viking. We’ll miss you, but I think both sides are ready to move on. oldcracker says: Feb 23, 2017 2:48 PM \nHow about Peterson going to the NYG’s and showing the Cryboys what they missed out on? Feb 23, 2017 2:52 PM \nFake news. The Vikings have been shopping him for weeks. Feb 23, 2017 2:54 PM \nShouldn’t they, like, thought of this months ago?
