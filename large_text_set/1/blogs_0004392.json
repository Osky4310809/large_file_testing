That astounding number is double the entire population of the L.A. city of Calabasas.

Unfortunately though, even the most well-intentioned often use that as a crutch to spread awareness without ever attaching real people to the crisis. \nThat’s why it’s so moving to see the personal touch that Rams defensive end William Hayes is putting into his journey to aid the homeless population of Los Angeles. Related: Fellow Rams DE William Hayes brought Robert Quinn home from hospital \nHayes founded the Big Play Hayes Foundation in 2016, and according to the foundation’s mission statement , it’s really all about spreading hope and love to those in our community who have been neglected. \n“The Big Play Hayes Foundation is all about spreading hope. We work with kids in difficult situations and adults who are experiencing homelessness. My focus for the foundation is to be a support system for the people we serve and to make a positive impact in each of their lives.” \nOn Tuesday, the team posted this poignant video in which Hayes discusses his desire to use his platform to make changes for the homeless in L.A. He also takes on the role of Santa, bringing gifts to children who otherwise wouldn’t have received any.
