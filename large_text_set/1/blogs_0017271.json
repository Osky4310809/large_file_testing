There are convicted killers I’d sooner stick up for. \nOnes who’ve shown remorse, told the police which dumpster the bodies are in, kept it to single figures etc. \nHunt is pursuing an agenda that will cost many, many lives. His wilful under-resourcing of the NHS means this week even urgent cancer surgery was getting cancelled. This is a Code Red – the service at absolute breaking point. \nSo says every hospital, every medical organisation, every frontline staff member. The only people who disagree? \nWhy, it’s HRH Huntweasel and his calculating clutch of oleaginous apparatchiks – fingers in ears, blithely trying to find a positive spin on hospitals declaring a formal state of emergency.

Well he didn’t, but he may as well have. “It’s a normal winter workload,” was what he actually said. \nThis is not normal. I have skin in the game here. I worked six years as a junior doctor, until I quit to become a writer a few years back. \nAt the time, my colleagues thought I’d lost it – why would a doctor leave the profession? \nSure, it’s not the best-paid job, but they don’t do it out of greed (despite Hunt’s claims to the contrary) – they do it because it’s the most rewarding job in the world. I was only the second doctor to leave from my class of 200. \nToday, my Facebook feed heaves with friends parachuting out of the profession, leaving the country, desperately scratching around for a Plan B. They share devastating, heartbreaking stories from the wards. The NHS is in crisis (Photo: AFP) \nThe obstetrician likening the situation on her labour ward to aid work she did in sub-Saharan Africa. The seasoned orthopaedic surgeon who broke down in tears 16 hours into an eight-hour shift. \nThe near-miss with a five-year-old waiting on an A&E trolley. \nLives risked, lives probably already lost. And no obvious way forward. \nI suspect Hunt actually does have a way forward. He’s not stupid. There you go – I found a positive about him! An unfeeling moral vacuum, maybe, but not an idiot. \nI believe he’s deliberately underfunding the service in order to drive it into the ground, dismantle it and sell off the scrap to the highest bidder. The only other possible explanation is he hates ill people and wants them to die – we all have that annoying friend who complains hospitals freak them out. \nIt all became clear this week when he had a dummy run of his masterplan and sold off his own company Hotcourses for a £15million personal profit. \nJeremy – this year you earned 680 times more than a newly qualified doctor, yet they’re the greedy ones? Be glad you’re loaded enough for private medical cover – you’ll struggle to find a doctor on the NHS eager to treat you right now. Not that there’s a bed.
