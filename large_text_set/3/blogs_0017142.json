The five-day shindig saw the industry’s best minds dish out a series of red-carpet winners, wardrobe heroes and solid seasonal trends. Between these designer takeovers, we also had ourselves some celebrity spotting that did, to some extent, whet our Bollywood appetite. (Also, since movie icons grabbing coffee at our favourite cafes isn’t a regular occurrence in Delhi). ICYMI, we decided to round up these beautiful showstoppers. \n1. We had our first celebrity sighting when Vaani Kapoor emerged in a black velvet gown, featuring a very sexy thigh-high slit and a waist cut-out, by Rina Dhaka. The actress sported dramatic eyes and soft tousled hair for her glamorous ramp outing. \n2. Maybelline girl, Alia Bhatt closed the show for Namrata Joshipura (in collaboration with the beauty brand), dressed in a sparkling jumpsuit by the designer. For her part as the beauty ambassador, the actress worked smoky lids with ultra-sleek hair and a nude lip. \n3. Sakshi Tanwar was the surprise showstopper for Anju Modi (a brand favoured by Deepika Padukone during movie promotions). The recently-turned Bollywood star did a fine job of strutting in an exquisite ivory lehenga. \n4. Dia Mirza emerged in a mulberry-hued tulle dress for H&M“Sustainable Fashion” presentation. A braided hairdo, coupled with a spring-apt dewy face finished out her look. \n5. Richa Chaddha power-dressed up for designer Rohit Kamra’s menswear collection, sporting a velvet waistcoat, leather pants and a short hairdo. \n6. And lastly, cool-girl Anushka Manchanda dominated our fashion feeds, emerging in athletic gear for Nought One. The actress-musician did full justice to her streetwear-inspired separates (a camouflage-print sweatsuit paired with a workout top).
