OUT OF EVERYWHERE\" pic.twitter.com/NPkcE84o9s — Alexander Rubinstein (@AlexR_DC) March 3, 2017 \nSeveral activists carried a massive white banner with red lettering stating “US out of Everywhere,” and as the orchestra stopped playing, video shows activists chanting “US out of Syria.” \n“We were there because the White Helmets are a PR effort for the US government to drum up support for intervention in Syria. We are opposed to US intervention in Syria and everywhere else, we thought it was important to protest this event,” an activist with Hands Off Syria told RT. \nActivists refused to be identified because they’ve already faced harassment and lost jobs over their views on US involvement in Syria. \n“It was bad, because they were taking a very beautiful and well-known music and basically trying to drum up war propaganda and sentiment to justify the war when in fact that the US has bases in Syria, the US has already invaded Syria, US is already responsible for the protracted war against the Syrian people. Half of the country are refugees,” Another activist told RT. “And they want to give you Beethoven’s Ninth [Symphony]. That’s sick.” These are the fliers activists passed out as they disrupted the #WhiteHelmets at their pop-up concert at Grand Central pic.twitter.com/VG5iffjHiP — Alexander Rubinstein (@AlexR_DC) March 3, 2017 \nActivists who handed out leaflets about the White Helmets said three or four of the players in the concert felt used realizing what they were associating with.

Russian intervention infuriated the Obama administration, which has sought regime change in Syria. \nSince then, allegations have arisen that the White Helmets are little more than a propaganda effort funded by the US government. \n“All you have to do is look at their funding source – which is the US government – specifically the USAID, and the UK foreign office have given tens of millions of dollars to this group which is run by the Syria Civil Defense, which is a PR firm,” independent journalist Rania Khalek told RT. “The purpose of all this is to push for regime change in the public sphere. To paint a narrative that pushes for escalation and military intervention in Syria. ” \nIn April 2016, the State Department admitted the US had mysteriously revoked the visa of White Helmets leader Raed Saleh over ties with terrorist groups, even as the group received $23 million in US taxpayer funds. Saleh was able to attend the Academy Awards in February after a federal court overruled the Trump administration’s travel restrictions on Syrians and residents of six other majority-Muslim countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:37:33.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
