The teens then proceeded to steal $55 from her wallet and leave her for dead.\nINSANE!!!\nThey are charged with one count each of first-degree felony attempted aggravated murder and aggravated robbery and four counts each of second-degree felony obstructing justice. \nThe teen accused of shooting Deserae in the head appeared in court Tuesday, while his accomplice made his own court appearance Wednesday.\nCache County Sheriff Deputy Brian Groves testified that the alleged shooter had told his friend he \"got tired\" of all the messages and texts Deserae was sending him, to which his friend replied, \"It would be pretty easier to get rid of her.\" WTF! That is straight-up evil!\nApparently this wasn't the teens' first attempt at trying to kill Deserae, as they also had an initial plan to slit her throat on an earlier occasion.\nDeserae is currently in the hospital and her parents say she is recovering. They have set up a GoFundMe page for her.\nOur thoughts are with her! May she make a full recovery!\n[ Image via GoFundMe ] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:37:29.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
