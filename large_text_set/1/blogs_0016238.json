He also knows a thing or two about rocking a puffy coat . \n6. Kevin Durant A photo posted by ThompsonScribe (@thompsonscribe) on Jul 21, 2016 at 12:24pm PDT \nWe’d give our left leg to bring Tupac back, but basketball star Kevin Durant raised us one more with this large memorial piece of the rapper. \n5. Harry Styles A photo posted by @harrystyles on Mar 9, 2013 at 8:15am PST \nPop star Harry Styles’ butterfly tat suits him—and guarantees he can never evolve to a form without six-pack abs. \n4. David Beckham A photo posted by David Beckham (@davidbeckham) on Mar 30, 2016 at 10:28am PDT \nDavid and Victoria Beckham’s tattoos are cool enough to have their own website . Our favorite double whammy: a pin-up illustration of Victoria tattooed on David. \n3.

Lenny Kravitz A photo posted by Lenny Kravitz (@lennykravitz) on Dec 31, 2014 at 3:53pm PST \nThere’s getting “Mom” in a heart tattooed on you, and there’s getting a gorgeous portrait of actual mom on your forearm. Singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz did the latter. \n1. Conor McGregor A photo posted by Conor McGregor Official (@thenotoriousmma) on Nov 3, 2016 at 7:00am PDT \nWe will overlook the Irish MMA fighter having his own name inked on his body (did he think he was going to forget?) because who else could pull off a giant ape AND tiger head chest tattoo? We feel the sudden urge to hit the bench press.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T04:18:36.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
