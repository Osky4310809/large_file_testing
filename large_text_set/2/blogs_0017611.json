LOUIS,” the group wrote. \nSteven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center, said he still condemned President Donald Trump’s insensitivity towards Jews, but acknowledged that Pence was setting the right example. \n“Vice President Pence proved to be the ultimate mensch by visiting, and even cleaning, the desecrated Jewish graves in St. Louis,” Goldstein wrote in a statement. “Make no mistake: We have been critical of President Trump for his gross insensitivity to Antisemitism, including through his omission of Jews in Holocaust remembrance. But through the Vice President’s visit to St. Louis today, this Administration finally showed America the kind of response our nation was waiting for all along — a response filled with proactive heart.” What do you think?
