Acoustic guitar-based music isn’t easy to render particularly unique, however given the obvious Latin undertones to his music, Blanco White appears to succeed rather well in exactly that.\nCoupled with powerful-yet-gentle vocals that send the listener on a holiday very much on their own, it’s no surprise that Blanco White is steadily getting picked up by every mood-based Spotify playlist going.\nMusic licensing departments would likely dub this guy an absolute goldmine.\nMost-streamed track on Spotify : Chalk (over 1.2M listens so far)\nMost-recent video :\n\n \nWhat will he be doing in 2017 ? Mr White has, as mentioned above, caused quite the stir in certain folk/pop circles courtesy of his atmospheric Latin-tinged tones.\nGiven the first EP went so well, he figured another EP would probably be a smart move and this time has enlisted the involvement of long-time Communion Music producer type Ian Grimble, noted for his recent work with the likes of Bear’s Den, Matt Corby and Daughter.\nThe EP was recorded at the end of last year and is due out for release at the end of this month.\nMore: Music Listen to Chuck Berry's new single Big Boys as details of his last album emerge \nArtist of the day 21/03: Veridian \nLouisa Johnson's new music video is basically a mini Coachella \nSigned to : Yucatan Records\nUpcoming live dates :\n28 March: Sofar Sounds, London 29 March: The Troubadour, London ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:29:16.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
