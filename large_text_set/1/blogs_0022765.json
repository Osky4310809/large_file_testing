On course for a fourth straight league title, which would be unprecedented in the long and proud history of the club, into the semifinals of both domestic cups and into the knockout stage of the Champions League, 2016-17 has the makings of another glorious season for the Lisbon giants. \nBut it comes at a cost. The European Club Football Landscape report released earlier this month shows that Benfica have the second highest net debt in Europe -- a whopping €336 million. \nIts Seixal Youth Academy has produced some wonderful players in recent times -- Bernardo Silva, Andre Gomes and Renato Sanches spring to mind -- and club president Luis Filipe Vieira insists the long term goal is to have a first team made up entirely of homegrown talents. But until the debt is brought down to manageable levels, Benfica's young diamonds are likelier to be sold to help reduce the debt than feature in any long term team building plans. \nAnd with Benfica in such rude health on the pitch, now could be the perfect time to cash in on some of their academy products. \nNo wonder, therefore, that not a day goes by without one of Europe's biggest clubs linked to an Eagles player. Official list of scouts at Benfica-Napoli. pic.twitter.com/3OkCEMg9jE - Tom Kundert (@PortuGoal1) 6 December 2016 \nHere are five highly promising young Benfica stars who help explain why a long list of scouts make regular visits to the Estadio da Luz. \nNelson Semedo, right-back \nAn attack-minded right-back who has enjoyed a brilliant campaign after coming back from a serious knee injury. The 23-year-old is Benfica's most used player this season and his consistently outstanding displays have not gone unnoticed. \nLinked to Bayern Munich and Manchester United, Chelsea have now emerged as strong contenders to sign the Lisbon-born player, who recently said he would be happy to play out his whole career at Benfica. Victor Lindelof has been heavily linked with Manchester United. \nVictor Lindelof, centre-back \nPowerful Swedish central defender who enjoyed a spectacular debut season in Benfica's first team last year, making a big contribution to help Benfica win the Portuguese championship after an epic title race with Lisbon rivals Sporting. \nLindelof, who is equally comfortable at right-back, also shone brightly in the Champions League, most notably in the two legs of a hard-fought quarterfinal tie against German powerhouse Bayern Munich. \nHe seemed all set to complete a £35m deal to Manchester United early in January, and the latest reports from Portugal suggest the deal will still go through but only in the summer. \nAlex Grimaldo, left-back \nClassy Spanish left-back snapped up after he was let go by Barcelona last season. A La Masia graduate, Grimaldo was magnificent in the opening months of the season, his intelligent positioning, quick thinking and smooth passing betraying his Barcelona education, only to be struck down by a troublesome hernia injury that has kept him out of action for three months and which necessitated an operation in Madrid. \nIt also scuppered a widely reported transfer to Manchester City, where Pep Guardiola, who knows the player from his Catalonia days, is said to be a big fan. Should Grimaldo fully recover before the end of the season, he could well be on his way to the Etihad in the summer. \nEderson, goalkeeper \nAnother player who has been strongly linked to Manchester City, the 23-year-old Brazilian goalkeeper fulfils the Guardiola requisite of being excellent with his feet, and has the bonus of being a brilliant shot stopper. Attentive and unafraid to come off his line, he dominates the penalty area and with sharp reactions, athleticism and a big frame, he is a formidable last line of defence for the Eagles. \nYet perhaps his most impressive aspect has been his unflappable composure. The youngster has been almost faultless since getting his chance midway through last season. So good has Ederson been that nobody questions him keeping veteran Brazil stopper Julio Cesar on the bench, notwithstanding Cesar has also been tremendous for Benfica. \nEderson signed an improved contract with a whopping €60m release clause on Monday. Although players are rarely sold for the price of their release clause -- it is inserted to give the selling club a stronger bargaining position -- if any club wants to buy him they will undoubtedly have to pay big. Dubbed the next Cristiano Ronaldo, Goncalo Guedes is said to be on Paris Saint-Germain's radar. \nGoncalo Guedes \nA Benfica regular despite only turning 20 in November, Goncalo Guedes is an exciting talent who, according to latest reports , may have already played his last game for Benfica. \nWith raw speed, decent technique and a rocket of a shot, Guedes has shone both wide on either flank and in the middle, which is where he has been stationed most of this season while Benfica's star striker Jonas was out injured. \nWhen Guedes was selected by Portugal manager Fernando Santos in November 2015 he was the first 18-year-old to crack the squad since the player he is often compared to: Cristiano Ronaldo. Reports in Tuesday's Portuguese press say a deal has been struck with PSG, but nothing official has been announced. \nTom Kundert covers Portuguese football for ESPN FC. Twitter: @PortuGoal1.
