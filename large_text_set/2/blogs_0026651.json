Going for Tapas \nEvery tourist who comes to Spain wants to try tapas, one of the most famous of Spanish traditions. But many don't understand it. A 'tapa' is not a type of food, it's a way of eating it. Tapas are small portions, but they can be of anything. And to 'go for tapas' ( tapear in Spanish) does not mean ordering a lot of dishes in one restaurant (though, of course, you can), but to bar-hop, eating a different tapa in each bar. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Road Trip Apps 2. Flamenco in Spain \nProbably the most famous Spanish tradition - but so often misunderstood. \nFirstly, flamenco is not a dance. It sometimes has dancing in it . What flamenco actually is is a musical style, with far more emphasis on the guitar, vocals and rhythm than the dancing. In fact, the whole idea of flamenco dancing is a little paradoxical. True flamenco is spontaneous; true flamenco dancing requires the pretty dress: but if you're being spontaneous, you won't have the pretty dress on! Image: (c) Alexa Van Slageren 3. The Siesta \nOne of the puzzling aspects of Spain to outsiders is the siesta. Why do all the stores close in the afternoon. Do people really go to sleep? How long should your siesta be? The idea of the siesta is evolving and with everyone's busier lifestyles, it's not so easy to catch 40 winks anymore - but people still do. \nRead more about Siesta in Spain . Owen Franken/Getty Images 4. To Tip or Not to Tip? \nEvery guide book says something different on tipping. One blog post I wrote once provoked some harsh criticisms from a few sheltered middle-class Spaniards who live in a different world to the majority of people in Spain. I investigated the subject with this survey on tipping in Spain to get to the bottom of precisely when to tip and how much. \nRead more about Tipping in Spain . Image: (c) Damian Corrigan 5. Bullfighting in Spain \nBullfighting, the most controversial of Spanish traditions, is a mixed blessing for Spain. Many tourists are very curious to see it and view it as a fascinating insight into Spanish culture, but it is also a stain on the country's reputation for others. Bullfighting is nowhere near as popular as it used to be, but it still features prominently in the country's self-image. \nRead more about Bullfighting in Spain . Bar El 2D in Malasa√±a.

What's more, it isn't a preserve of the young - there is a part of town for every age group and every taste. Just remember one thing - you have to go out very late - if you're in the bars before 10pm, you'll be drinking alone. \nRead more about Madrid Nightlife .

Miss the narrow windows for each and you end up eating on your own or in a substandard touristy restaurant that caters precisely for those who haven't gotten in sync with the Spanish way of eating.

Festivals in Spain \nThe Spanish eating , drinking and dancing culture steps up a gear (if that's possible), when there's a festival on. Every town or village has a local fiesta , at which point the locals don't just eat and drink because it's fun, they do so because it would be un-Spanish not to. \nRead more about Festivals in Spain . Paella at Bodega El Patio, Malaga. (c) Damian Corrigan 9. Sangria and Paella \nMost tourists who visit Spain want to eat paella and drink sangria - what could be more Spanish? But crafty bars and restaurants know how much tourists want to sample these symbols of Spanish life and will exploit you accordingly. \nSee also:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:52:46.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
