Available Monday, it charges $80 per month with unlimited data, talk and text on a smartphone or tablet. Verizon charges $45 per line for four lines. \nThe announcement comes shortly after a study revealed Verizon can no longer call itself the fastest wireless network. T-Mobile is just as good as Verizon, according to the 2017 State of Mobile Networks report from OpenSignal. Those two are followed by AT&T and then Sprint. \nIn the press release, Verizon described itself as \"the best 4G LTE network in the country.\"\nOf course, Verizon's new plan is not completely unlimited. Verizon, after several lawsuits with it and other carriers, notes the potential of throttling. When a plan owner exceeds 22 GB of data on a single line, Verizon will lessen the access to data. \n\"While we don’t expect to do that very often, network management is a crucial tool that benefits all Verizon customers,\" Verizon wrote in the press release. \nUnlimited data on the Verizon network has arrived https://t.co/PgEEyTmNsq #VZUnlimited pic.twitter.com/OSC6S54dlD \n— Verizon News (@VerizonNews) February 12, 2017 \nVerizon previously offered an unlimited plan, but it discontinued it along with other wireless carriers. However, in recent months, other carriers have been bringing it back. For example, AT&T offers an unlimited data plan for cellphones, if customers also get DirecTV or AT&T's home TV service, U-verse.\n“We’ve built our network so we can manage all the activity customers undertake. Everything we’ve done is to provide the best experience on the best network – and we’ve built it for the future, not just for today,” Ronan Dunne, president of Verizon’s wireless division, said in a statement. “We also fundamentally want you to have more choice. We’re not limiting you to a single plan.\"\nBONUS: Ikea designed a refugee shelter and it lasts 6x longer than traditional emergency tents", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:21:10.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
