In that policy speech — 97 minutes, 18,600 Chinese characters—Premier Li Keqiang signaled a slight course adjustment for the world’s second-largest economy and some important changes in tone. Here are five takeaways: 5 Mar 2017 5:36am Charles Hutzler 1 Politics Is in Command \nThough Mr. Li took center stage, President Xi Jinping is clearly in charge. Mr. Li’s policy address contained eight mentions of Mr. Xi, some including his new title as “the core” of the Communist Party leadership . Not since Mao Zedong more than 40 years ago has a serving leader gotten so many shoutout s in the policy address. It shows Mr. Xi’s strong hand going into a Communist Party Congress later this year to chart the course for his second five-year term. European Pressphoto Agency 2 Growth Matters \nKeeping the economy humming at a fairly high rate is still a priority. Mr. Li set this year’s growth target at “around 6.5%,” a sha de slower than the last year’s range of 6.5% to 7% and actual reported growth of 6.7%, the weakest pace in a quarter century . Still, Mr. Li added that growth should be “higher if possible.” The faster tempo is needed, he says, to create jobs and raise living standards. 6.5% China's 2017 growth target 3 Restructuring Matters Too—Sort Of \nThe emphasis on growth means that putting the economy under the much-needed restructuring the government has stressed for years is taking second place. Mr. Li recom mitted to efforts to reduce excess capacity in the steel and coal sectors, pare down corporate debt and make housing afforda ble for first-time buyers. The going is likely to be slow: “Stability is of overriding importance.” Getty Images 4 Signaling Changes \nThe governme nt looks to domestic demand, and consumer spending in particular, as a new engine of growth . While government outlays for health care, education and pensions are getting a minor boost, policies to promote domestic demand are more geared to businesses than households. Tax cuts and exemptions are being doled out to smalle r firms and startups. An exception: no more mobile roaming a nd long-distance fees on domestic calls. Bloomberg News 5 A Trump Effect \nU.S. Pr esident Donald Trump didn’t merit a mention but his shadow loomed. Mr. Li cited the challenge posed by deglobaliz ation, protectionism and “uncertainties” about the direction of other major economies. Beijing’s recipe, he says, is to push ahead with regional trade agreements. Infrastructure at home features prominently, with $377 billion earmarked for railways, highways and waterways this year. Mr. Trump has yet to make good on his campaign pledge for a $1 trillion infrastructure binge .
