Yes, it’s important to give your name and explain the situation when you call 911, but there’s some things you should tell them first if you’re calling from a mobile phone, just in case. \nWhen you dial 911 with a cell phone, the call gets picked up by a nearby emergency services call center known as a public safety answering point (PSAP) .
