Ashley Graham talks about Miss Canada's body-positive message: She's a size 6... That's so crazy to say! #MissUniverse @gmanews pic.twitter.com/lex5uBQneP â€” Bianca Rose Dabu (@biancadabu) January 29, 2017 \nIn a series of recent Instagram posts, Bearchell, a 23-year-old lawyer in training from Moose Jaw, Canada, responded to commenters' jabs about her weight, sharing older pageant pics with deeply personal messages about why her frame may not look the same as other Miss Universe contestants. \n\"To be truthful, I restricted my food intake intensely at previous pageants and was miserable, self-conscious and I never felt good enough,\" she wrote. \"No matter how little I ate and how much weight I lost, I constantly compared myself to others and felt like I could still lose more.\" \n\"My mental perception did not match the physical body I saw in the mirror. There were days I would eat a protein bar, workout for hours and struggle to fall asleep because I as so hungry. My body is not naturally lean and that's okay. I am healthy. I am fit. I am confident. I am me.\" A photo posted by Siera Bearchell (@sierabearchell) on Jan 17, 2017 at 10:26am PST A photo posted by Siera Bearchell (@sierabearchell) on Jan 21, 2017 at 6:03am PST \nSee more from Miss Universe.
