Never.” \nThe friend added: “He said he had received a statement from the McCanns saying they were pleased there was an ongoing investigation which they hoped would unearth some news but they haven’t been in contact with him, neither has their spokesperson. \n“It seems he was rehashing a years-old statement that was circulated to all the media.” \nMr Williams-Thomas revealed his theory about that fateful night in Praia da Luz in May 2007 when he appeared on the show as part of a new series on unsolved crimes.

He’s said this all before and he once stood outside Apartment 5A reporting his same old belief.

It’s all based on speculation and it’s a free country and they’ve got enough to be dealing with.” \nFormer GP Kate and heart doctor Gerry, both 48, of Rothley, Leics, believe Maddie could still be alive and have never given up hope of finding her. They face the heart-breaking 10th anniversary of her disappearance in 10 weeks. She would now be aged 13. \nDetectives have explored dozens of theories about Madeleine's disappearance from being snatched by paedophiles and murdered during a botched burglary.
