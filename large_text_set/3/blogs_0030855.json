MORE CALGARY NEWS | Fire guts home in Sundance neighbourhood of Calgary \n\"And we always run into problems with parents not liking our booth, so it's nice to be able to come somewhere where we can do whatever, show whatever. This is a good opportunity for people to showcase their work and their art they otherwise wouldn't be allowed to. I'm surprised it's taken this long for something like this to come along.\" Kelso ‘Suicide’ Curtis was one of the presenters at Not Safe For Con at the Grey Eagle Casino on Saturday. (Kate Adach/CBC) \nThere were some limits on what could be shown, however, as both men and women were advised to keep their chests covered. \nBrian McCready said being able to display risque artwork made the event a richer experience for some. \n\"It's a brand new event and it's a brand new sub-genre,\" he said. \"There's lots of this kind of artwork at the Comic Expo, but it has to be kept under tables and it has to be show very carefully. Here, they can display what they want.\" Models Zory, left, and Vader, right, were at Not Safe For Con representing Strange and Beautiful, say it's surprising Calgary hasn't seen an event like this before. (Kate Adach/CBC) \nOlwen Bell, known by her stage name Arabella Allure, said an adult-only event has been a long time coming. \n\"When it comes to censorship, violence is never really censored, it's the sexuality that's censored and I think that's just not a healthy way to approach life,\" she said. \n\"It's cool to watch someone getting killed but sexy human relations are somehow taboo? That doesn't make sense to me.\" With files from Kate Adach", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T05:57:58.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
