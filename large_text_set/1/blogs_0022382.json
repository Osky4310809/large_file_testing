Trust me when I say that it wasn’t always easy for a girl like me to find relatable beauty icons : I have almost-black hair and deep brown eyes. I also have a medium skin tone, and while you’d think that would be relatively common, the truth is, few stars had similar complexions when I was growing up.\nLuckily, that’s changing. Hollywood is packed with stars who have complexions that resemble what so many other ladies have — and for girls like me, that doesn’t just make defining the looks that will work on my own complexion easier, it also gives us a positive lens through which to view our own appearances .\nHere are a few of the ladies I love to look up to for beauty inspo.\nJessica Alba Starting today, you can shop items from my closet at @vestiaireco with all proceeds going to @Baby2Baby!
