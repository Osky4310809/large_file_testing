'Escalating bullying' \n\"Our child came home to us in December and said she couldn't take any more and was going to throw herself off a bridge,\" said the mother. \n\"I had emailed the school about the escalation of the bullying and I don't think they dealt with it quickly enough - if they dealt with it sooner I don't think it would have escalated to this point.\" \nA statement from the school confirmed a ball bearing pellet gun was fired at a pupil. \nIt added: \"The matter has been treated very seriously and the pupil who fired the BB gun has been permanently excluded. \n\"We wish to send a message out to our community that this behaviour is completely unacceptable and will result in removal from our school. \n\"We have enlisted the support of a national organisation to help us further with our training of staff and pupils and support for our transgender pupils. \n\"We have met with the parents of the pupil to apologise and to see what we can do further as a school.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:52:31.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
