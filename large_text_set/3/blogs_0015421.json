Michelle Wie owns a share of the lead at the Bank of Hope Founders Cup after a smoking 7-under 65. The former prodigy and Nike fashionsta posted a couple late bogeys on her front nine and made the turn running hot. \nShe stuffed her approach on No. 1, her 10th hole, (according to LPGA founder Shirley Spork, who was near the green timing how long it took each player to putt) and rattled off a string of three consecutive birdies. \nOn the par-5 fifth, Wie hit 3-wood off the tee and 3-wood from the fairway to 15 feet and drained the eagle putt. She notched one more birdie on the eighth hole to close the front nine in 30. Jane Park and Vicky Hurst were also 7 under. \n“I really didn’t take time off this year,” said Wie of her offseason, “and came in with a really strong sense of commitment.” \nThe most obvious change for Wie these days is on the putting green, where she ditched the homemade table-top method and adopted a modified claw. \nMORE GOLF:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:09:37.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
