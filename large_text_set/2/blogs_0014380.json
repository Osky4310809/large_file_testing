For starters. But, because this is the terrified and divided world in which we now live, we're still talking about that proposed state law telling people where they can and can't go to the bathroom. \nAnd we have been for years, around the time Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick discovered that Dallas' long-on-the-books anti-bias ordinance, which prohibits discrimination when it comes to public accommodations, includes the words \"gender identity.\" The man gives new definition to the phrase \"scared straight.\" But so it goes and goes and goes despite mounting warnings from the Texas Association of Business, the NFL and now the NBA , Visit Dallas and every other big-city conventions and visitors bureau that passing a bill prohibiting transgender Texans from using bathrooms that match their gender identity will gut the state's economy by the hundreds of millions , quite possibly. Dan Patrick needs to keep his nose out of Dallas' business â€” and bathrooms \nAnd so we're clear: The bill might have a wee bit more wiggle room than, say, North Carolina's law, since Texas' bill would at least let organizations like the NFL or NBA set their own bathroom policies at convention centers or arenas. But make no mistake, it \"does preempt our ordinance,\" Dallas' city attorney Larry Casto said this week. \"We would be preempted from enforcing an anti-discriminatory application of our ordinance.\" In 2014, 77 percent of Dallas voters said they were in favor of such protections . \nSince the pocketbook argument isn't working, I don't expect appealing to Patrick's conscience (or Gov. Greg Abbott's) will succeed either. But 142 musicians, actors and artists tried that, too, this week, when they dispatched a potent Valentine's Day missive beseeching the state Legislature to stop \"the needless targeting\" of transgender people, especially kids, already facing \"higher rates of family rejection and homelessness, mental health issues and suicidality.\" \nThe letter is credited to The Creative Community Against Anti-LGBTQ Legislation in Texas and was signed by the likes of Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lawrence and Sting and Amys Poehler and Schumer and Dixie Chick Natalie Maines and dozens of other household names. It was made public on Valentine's Day -- 24 whole hours before a slew of new anti-LGBTQ bills were filed in Austin by lawmakers, many of them locals, who believe that being forced to marry or sell things to same-sex couples deprives them of their religious liberties. \nThree acclaimed musicians with deep Dallas ties attached their names to the Creative Community letter: Annie Clark (better known as St. Vincent), Sarah Jaffe and John Congleton, the latter an acclaimed producer who has worked with both women. None are necessarily known for their political advocacy. In fact, when I talked to Jaffe about the letter this week, she said she'd long been reluctant to speak out about anything. Kleinman: 'This is not a bathroom ordinance, it is an anti-discrimination ordinance update' \n\"I've always made it about the music,\" she said Wednesday night. \"But now, it's just not a time not to speak up.\" \nI asked Jaffe how she came to sign the letter, the brainchild of Jack Antonoff of the bands .fun and Bleachers . She said she received it via email the second week of February from a photographer acquaintance in Los Angeles, who thought that as a native-born Texan, Jaffe might want to lend her support to the growing coalition of Bathroom Bill opponents. Jaffe got up to speed on the issue, pronto, and said absolutely, then forwarded it to Congleton, who likewise affixed his moniker to the missive. \nAnd, yes. They all know what about half of you are probably thinking: Shut up and sing . Which, yawn, is the hoary argument made by people who believe artists are just clowns here to amuse and distract. \n\"I mean, to me it feels morally incorrect not to speak out,\" Jaffe said. I've known her for more than a decade, since she was a bespectacled teen wielding an acoustic guitar and pretty pop songs. We're acquaintances, at most, but I've never heard her speak so emphatically about anything. \n\"And, sure, there are going to be minor s---storms at every turn, but I would rather have people know where I stand on the matter,\" she said. \"I have never been an artist pushing politics. But I have no problem speaking out when I am angry or disagree. In this case, it was a matter of channeling that anger into something constructive. It may be a small part in the scheme of things, but it's a [expletive] part. And we need to play a part.\" \nClark, a Grammy-winning product of Lake Highlands , told our music critic Kelly Dearmore this week that she, too, couldn't say no to signing the letter. It was, she said, a pretty easy ask. \n\"I think we're seeing a lot of social issues swinging away from thoughtfulness and empathy,\" Clark said. \"So I'm just standing up for something I believe in, in my home state.\" \nBut for Congleton, this isn't just about artistic expression. Lending his name to the letter is also a business decision. John Congleton at his Oak Cliff studio (Michael Mulvey/Special Contributor) \nCongleton, who for years worked out of his Oak Cliff digs till recently decamping to Los Angeles, said this week that he's had to plead with some musicians to come to Texas to work with him, because they figured us for some know-nothing backwater. \n\"I always feel as if I had to defend Dallas and stand up for the state when it came to not being progressive enough,\" he said. \nThe cajoling usually worked: Congleton said just one musician, whose name he wants kept private, refused to make the sojourn to Oak Cliff. When Jaffe sent him the letter, he was more than happy to sign. \nI have no doubt Dan Patrick, Greg Abbott and the pushers of this bill will never so much as glance at the letter. But that is not the point. Here, allow me to let a Democratic state representative from Dallas explain why he thought it was \"great.\" \nBecause, Rafael Anchia said, \"these are stars, celebrities with followers and fans, and they can move public opinion.\" Even just a little. Which is better than nothing and why, in the end, they felt they had to do something while Anchia, Republican House Speaker Joe Straus and others do what Abbott apparently won't and flush the bathroom bill. \n\"I always remind people that the legislative process is not a bill-passing machine, it's a bill-killing machine,\" Anchia said. \"You know the Schoolhouse Rock song 'I'm Just a Bill'? Well, in the Texas Legislature that bill ends up in a pool of blood. There's not a happy song in the end.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:59:51.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
