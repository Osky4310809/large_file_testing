Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art ID: 10442276 “The exhibition attempts show her development into ‘Frida’ from a young girl to her death, all the interests and preoccupations, pets, friends, travel, lovers, art collecting, fashion, and the great art that she made in between. She wore her art and convictions on her body and through her life, including her dress, hair, jewelry, makeup.”\nID: 10454000 View this image ›\n“Frida Kahlo at 18 in Mexico,” Guillermo Kahlo, 1926. Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10442264 “Kahlo carefully crafted her appearance, since she knew the power of photographic portraits through her father’s profession. At times, she even assisted him in the darkroom.”\nID: 10454018 View this image ›\n“Untitled (Frida With Painted Corset),” Florence Arquin, 1941. Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10444246 “She presents herself almost the same in every image: mouth closed (there is some speculation that she did not smile because of bad teeth), straight back, serious, beautifully dressed, alert, and in clear possession of herself. This is not unlike a lot of portraiture of that time; however, she was so unique in her dress and her unusual beauty that many photographers from the US, Europe, and Mexico sought her out.”\nID: 10454051 View this image ›\n“Frida Kahlo With Classic Magenta Rebozo,” Nickolas Muray, 1939. Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10444228 “She liked it, too, so her conviviality made for an interesting portrait session. She and her husband, painter Diego Rivera, were among the first ‘artist celebrities’ of their time. The only other woman painter so well photographed was Georgia O’Keeffe, a contemporary of Kahlo’s.”\nID: 10454070 View this image ›\n“Frida Seated in Her Garden,” Florence Arquin,1943.

Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10442289 “Today, Kahlo represents a lot of what some believe threatens our culture: She was a communist, ethnic Mexican, feminist, [disabled], bisexual, a marijuana smoker, outspoken, and she demonstrated for workers’ rights.”\nID: 10454092 View this image ›\n“Frida Looking Into Mirror,” Lola Álvarez Bravo, 1944. Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10442160 “This was radical then, as it is today. If she tried to come into this country today, to accompany her husband or partake in a solo exhibition in New York, would she be detained at the border?”\nID: 10454109 View this image ›\n“Frida, on the Rooftop of Her Home in Altavista, in the San Ángel neighborhood of Mexico City,” Anonymous, 1939. Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10442104 “Think of how much we would lose if Frida Kahlo was denied entry into our country. Her beliefs and lifestyle remain relevant today for her unapologetic freedom of expression, of being the ‘other’ and proud of it, and for being unafraid to grasp her full potential as an artist and woman.”\nID: 10454120 View this image ›\n“Portrait of Frida Kahlo in Front of Her Painting ‘Earth Goddess, Frida and Diego,’” Héctor García, circa 1949. Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10442350 “Personally, my favorite picture is Imogen Cunningham’s portrait of Kahlo. Cunningham was a celebrated San Francisco portrait photographer and friend to the famous photographer Ansel Adams. The picture’s beautifully composed, lit, and printed, and Kahlo is young and radiant.”\nID: 10454149 View this image ›\n“Portrait of Frida Kahlo,” Imogen Cunningham, 1931. Throckmorton Fine Art / The Harn Museum of Art\nID: 10442365 “I hope people see these words in her life and visage: joy, pain, love, forgiving, proud, revolutionary, feminist, enigmatic, contradictory, broken, strong, sensual, seeker, home, will.”\nID: 10454130 View this image ›\n“Funeral of Frida Kahlo,” Mayo Brothers, 1954.
