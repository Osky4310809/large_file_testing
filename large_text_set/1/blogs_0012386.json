The class takes place at Barry’s Bootcamp, but make no mistake, it doesn’t look like your average steel gray gym. With red lights beaming and EDM beats bumping, you’d think you were at any other raging nightclub in the city. \nThirty-one-year-old trainer Matty Maggiacomo and his 29-year-old DJ boyfriend Aaron Aanenson started the class. While Aanenson performs a set, Maggiacomo puts the class through a hellish, hour-long, full-body workout with a mix of cardio and high-intensity interval training.
