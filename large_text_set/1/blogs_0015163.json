Our colleagues on the ground in the Gambia will proactively contact all customers on holiday with us as soon as possible to prepare for return to the UK.” \nThe FCO have advised tourists: “The potential for military intervention and civil disturbance is high and could result in Banjul International Airport being closed at short notice. \n“You should follow events closely, take extra care, keep in regular contact with your tour operator and airline and continue to monitor travel advice and social media updates in case tensions rise as the current political deadlock continues.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:30:52.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
