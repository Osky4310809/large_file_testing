He knew what the teen was up to,\" said Arlington police lieutenant Chris Cook of officer Ball. \nAfter realizing he'd made a mistake, 17-year-old was surprised to hear Ball's punishment of choice. \n\"He said, 'You give me 200 push-ups, I won't put you in jail,\" said Lt. Cook. \"He could have very well arrested this teen, but instead he tried to do something better,\" said Lt. Cook about the unnamed teen. \n\"I would have made him do more push-ups,\" the boy's mother said regarding the officer's actions. \nWhile officer Ball was inspired by the discipline on his high school football team , exercising on marijuana may actually be better for you. One California gym even allows its members to smoke weed while they work out ; a world's first. \nRaiza Paredez posted video documentation of the alternative punishment, which has since received over 200,000 views. \n\"Big UP's to the Arlington Police Officer that made the young black guy that decided to smoke weed on the movie theater parking lot to do push-ups then take him to jail or shoot him just Cuz. We need more cops like this. #Policeeverywhereneedtotakenotes #ArlingtonPoliceDept,\" Paredez wrote. \nAlexandra Rosenmann is an AlterNet associate editor.
