You can watch them on the Escape Plan 2: Hades set in Atlanta below! \nAlso starring are Jaime King ( Sin City , Hart of Dixie ) and Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson ( Get Rich or Die Tryin’ ). King is set to play the role of Abigail Ross in the film, while Jackson will reprise his role of ‘Hush’ from the first film. Steven C. Miller ( Marauders , Arsenal ) is directing. \nThe original Escape Plan followed one of the world’s foremost authorities on structural security, who agrees to take on one last job: breaking out of an ultra-secret, high-tech facility called “The Tomb.” Deceived and wrongly imprisoned, Ray Breslin (Stallone) must recruit fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to help devise a daring, nearly impossible plan to escape from the most protected and fortified prison ever built. \nEscape Plan was released by Summit Entertainment in 2013, and though it only grossed $25 million domestically, it took in $137 million worldwide with the bulk of the international gross coming from China. \nEscape Plan 2: Hades is a co-production between Emmett/Furla/Oasis and Chinese company Leomus Pictures .
