Panfilo Lacson and his committee on public order will give Arthur Lascañas a second chance to tell the chamber what he claims to know about death squads that allegedly operated in Davao City when Rodrigo Duterte was its mayor. \nThe principal argument of those who want to block Lascañas’ new testimony is that he had lied under oath the first time and should face charges for perjury instead of being given a chance to tell a completely different version of his original story. \nFacing the Senate for the first time last year, Lascañas had denied the claims of another self-confessed member of the Davao death squads, Edgar Matobato, about the operations of the DDS allegedly under the supervision of mayor Duterte. Lascañas’ testimony led the Senate committee conducting the inquiry on extrajudicial killings to conclude that the death squads did not exist and the Duterte administration does not condone EJKs. \nThe senators’ concerns about Lascañas’ credibility are valid. But under the circumstances, they may also want to find out the reason for the reversal of Lascañas’ testimony. It could provide an interesting twist to a narration of gruesome events allegedly involving the nation’s highest official. \nIf he is barred from telling the Senate what he claims is the truth this time, it’s unlikely that Lascañas will keep his mouth shut anyway. Now under the protection of human rights lawyers, he is going to take his story to whoever is interested in hearing it – and there are many who will want to listen. \nInstead of rejecting his turnaround outright, senators should consider Lascañas’ Take 2 as an opportunity to puncture his story. Instead of merely giving a “public confession” at a press conference organized by staunch Duterte critic Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Lascañas must now narrate his new version of events under oath.

Still, if he insists he’s telling the truth this time, he must know that his own statements can be used to indict him for mass murder. If he lies under oath again, senators can hold him liable for perjury and propose appropriate sanctions against his handlers.
