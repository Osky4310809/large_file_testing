Is it possible, likely or can you confirm instances where the CIA used Malware to \"Attribute\" cyberattacks to other nations? Possibly Russia https://t.co/Ay1Ms84TPT \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 9, 2017 \nLater on that day, actor and LGBT rights advocate Chaz Bono sent out a tweet of his own where he quoted Hannity, asking if the “new Right” were “traitors” and “Fascists” like President Donald Trump. So is the new Right, all Putin loving, reality denying, traitors to the principals our country was founded on, Fascists, Just Like #Trump ? https://t.co/lfpfxIEpr2 \n— Chaz Bono (@ChazBono) March 10, 2017 \nThat tweet was mostly ignored, considering it came from the verified account of a celebrity, gathering up a little more than two dozen retweets. However, almost two days later, Hannity noticed, and he wasn’t happy. Chaz clearly you are just ignorant. Read the @wikileaks info released this week. Try and educate yourself before tweeting inane lib tlk pts! https://t.co/hLWri23Lx7 \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 11, 2017 Also Chaz I thought you liberals were supposed to be \"tolerant\", &\"inclusive\". You r just the typical phony Hollywood hypocrite. https://t.co/hLWri23Lx7 \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 11, 2017 I have said many times we should NOT trust Putin. I embrace truth everyday. I love my country and am not a fascist. You r ignorant and dull. https://t.co/hLWri23Lx7 \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 11, 2017 Chaz come on my TV show so I can expose to all what a hypocrite you are and that you're dumber than dirt. https://t.co/hLWri23Lx7 \n— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 11, 2017 \nIn response to Hannity’s offer to appear on his TV show, Bono declined, saying he doesn’t “play with stupid.” Oh Sean, while that's tempting, I don't play with stupid. But have fun denigrating the CIA and propping up Putin. Reagan would be so proud. https://t.co/eaqIrPeX7X \n— Chaz Bono (@ChazBono) March 11, 2017 \nWe’ll make sure to keep you updated if this beef continues. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:29:46.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
