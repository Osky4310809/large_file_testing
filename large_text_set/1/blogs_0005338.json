The record business is very hard now I can’t even predict what is going to be successful or not. But with this I was able to sit there and say the reason you are here today is a job. We are going to give you an opportunity to play around the UK 8 shows a week. By the end of the year I hope these will be the start of careers of years to come.” Simon Cowell is considering legal action against the BBC show \nGary even hired former X Factor judge Dannii Minogue on the panel, and reportedly attempted to poach current X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger.

You just are.

I will do anything to get me from that space. I’ll go for a run. I’ll go and have an ice bath or I’ll go and watch my son’s football game. I know what I need to do to get out of it. And that means I have to keep working.” Gary admitted he was depressed following Take That split (Photo: Rex Features) \nHe continues to explain that all performers battle similar demons, saying: “Because it’s an indescribable thing, waving off at Hyde Park and as far as your eye can see there’s hands waving back at you. Now that’s not normal, that isn’t.” \nHe continues that it is important artists manage to handle “the balance of life”. \nLet It Shine begins on BBC1 at 7pm on Saturday, and will go head to head with ITV’s The Voice.
