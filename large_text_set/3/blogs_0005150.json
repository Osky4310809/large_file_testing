Giggs, Krept & Konan, Dave and Kyla are other U.K. artists that have joined Drake on stage over the course of the tour. \nBryson Tiller announced that he was vibing with Drake for something that might be featured on More Life . \nDrizzy also recently shared a new song called “ Hush Up The Silence ” featuring WizKid. And, of course, he has already released “Two Birds One Stone,” “Fake Love” and the 21 Savage-assisted “Sneakin'” that were advertised as singles for More Life . \nOh, and that collab with Jennifer Lopez still hasn’t surfaced after the two were getting cuddly for the ‘Gram before sharing a prom kiss . \nThere have been a couple of rumored tracklists circulating (which means that at least one of them is fake … or both — because the internet). Both have more than the 20 new tracks that HDD reported were coming. Both have songs with English MC Giggs. \nAlleged production is from 40, Boi1da, Southside, TM88, Vinylz and Murda Beatz. \nMore Life is the follow-up to Drake’s record-breaking VIEWS , which was also nominated for several Grammys, but received a lowly 2.9 rating on HipHopDX and was named one of our worst albums of 2016.
