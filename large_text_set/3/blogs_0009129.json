Some of the cold and snow will reach as far south as the Tennessee Valley and Carolinas . \nTemperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below normal, on average, from Minneapolis to Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Boston. \n“Unlike the unseasonable warmth of February, frequent blasts of cold air will dive into the Midwest and Northeast into next week,” AccuWeather Meteorologist Kyle Brown said. \nThe wave of cold poised to drop highs into the 10s and 20s F across the Upper Midwest on Friday will sweep into the mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys, upper part of the mid-Atlantic and New England to start the weekend. \n“The coldest air will settle over the Northeast on Saturday and Sunday,” Brown said. \nTemperatures will likely fail to rise out of the single digits and teens in much of New York state and New England. \nAverage daytime temperatures trend upward quickly during the month of March due to the stronger sun. During the middle of the month, normal highs range from the lower 40s in Minneapolis to the lower 50s in New York City. \nLows in the single digits will settle as far south as the central Appalachians over the weekend. \nThe cold will be compounded by gusty winds at times, especially in the Upper Midwest and Northeast, according to Brown. \nHowever, winds will not be nearly as intense as the destructive winds on Wednesday which wreaked havoc from the Upper Great Lakes to the interior Northeast. \nChilly air is forecast to be pulled as far south as the interior Southeast by Sunday. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:19:26.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
