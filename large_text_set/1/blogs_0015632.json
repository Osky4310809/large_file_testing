One of those features is light painting mode, a photographic technique that can only be composed with a long exposure.\nMost smartphones now come equipped with \"manual\" camera settings so that you can control things like the exposure and shutter speed, but the Honor 6X helps take the guesswork out of setting that up. Here's how to use it.\nHow to take light painting photographs with the Honor 6X Open the Camera app . Swipe over to the left. Select Light painting mode at the bottom.\n\nSelect which light painting mode pairs best with your situation. Tap the Shutter button . The shutter will stay open until you tap the red Stop button. When it's finished, the camera app will take you back to the preview window. \nFor best results, we suggest keeping the Honor 6X as steady as you can by holding or resting it against a flat surface. For added stability — for you serious light painters out there — try strapping it onto a mini tripod and pairing a Bluetooth remote so that you don't have to touch the screen.\nMore: Honor 6X vs. Honor 5X vs. Honor 8: What's the difference? \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T14:07:57.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
