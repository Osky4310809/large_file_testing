Perry the job of energy secretary, Perry “discovered” that he would “become the steward of a vast national security complex he knew almost nothing about, caring for the most fearsome weapons on the planet, the United States’ nuclear arsenal.” \nThe only source for this knowledge mentioned by the Times was Michael McKenna, an energy lobbyist who previously advised Perry’s failed 2016 presidential campaign and worked on the Trump transition’s Energy Department team. McKenna left the transition team weeks before the selection of Perry as secretary of energy was announced. \nMcKenna told the Times, “If you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, ‘I want to be an advocate for energy,'” The energy lobbyist added, “If you asked him now, he’d say, ‘I’m serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex.’ It’s been a learning curve.” (RELATED: The Washington Post’s Incredibly Botched Story On ‘Russian’ Hacking) \nMcKenna, though, told TheDC that the “headline” and lede of the story “don’t really reflect what I said.” He added that “of course” Perry understood the role of the Department of Energy when he was offered the job. Two-thirds of the DOE’s budget is devoted to maintaining the nation’s nuclear stockpiles. The nation’s primary site for the assembly and disassembly of nuclear weapons is located in Amarillo, Texas, a state Perry was governor of for 15 years. \nTheDC has reached out to Davenport and Sanger to see if they will issue a correction to the story. They did not respond by press time.
