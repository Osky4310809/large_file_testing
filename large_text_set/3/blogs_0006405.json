Taneytown, Glenarden, Bowie, and Hampstead rounded out the top five safest cities. \nThe state average violent crime rate was 5 crimes per 1,000 people. \nThe list was compiled after the group reviewed the most recent FBI Uniform Crime Report statistics. They did further research and removed cities with populations of less than 5,000. \nTo determine the safest cities, they were ranked based on the number of reported violent crimes (aggravated assault, murder, rape, and robbery) and property crimes (burglary, arson, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft) per 100,000 people. \nViolent crimes accounted for 70 percent, while property crimes accounted for the other 30 percent. \nHere is the top 30 list of Maryland’s safest cities: \n1.
