The first is a warm front well to the south that is just close enough that we will see periods of light rain in the city throughout Monday. Heavy cloud cover and east winds will keep the temperature in the low 40s well into Tuesday. \nA low pressure system is expected to form along the warm front as the front approaches the Delmarva peninsula tonight. As that storm gathers strength it will give us a steady rain tomorrow afternoon and evening. The storm will also slowly drag warmer air our way. Look for the temperature to crawl to the mid 40s tomorrow and continue up to the upper 40s on Wednesday afternoon. \nWinter's hammer is going to drop Wednesday evening as the jet stream will swing way south, allowing a cold front with plenty of Arctic air behind it to push across the country. Skies should clear on Thursday but the high will only be in the mid 30s. Colder weather, with highs only around freezing and lows in the lower 20s, is on tap for the weekend . We could see a few snow flurries on Friday, but don't hold your breath. \nThe upcoming cold weather could stick around for at least a couple of weeks. If it does, this could be the first month since June 2015 to be cooler than normal. The last 18 months, and 20 of the last 21 months, have been warmer than average, peaking with the freakishly warm December 2015. It hasn't been cold for a long time. \nLooking back, except for a couple of extreme events, the weather of 2016 was fairly quiet. The first extreme event was the Blizzard for the Ages that dumped more than two feet of snow on the city on January 23rd. Within a week the temperature had rebounded to the upper 50s, melting all but the filthiest of snow mounds . Two weeks after that we had our coldest Valentine's Day on record and the first below zero day in more than two decades. Temperatures once again quickly rebounded and the following month was the fourth warmest March since records began in 1869. August and September also turned in top ten warm months . \nConsistently warm months with almost no extended cold spells adds up to a warm year. 2016 tied 1990, 1991 and 1998 as the second warmest years on record, falling just a tenth of a degree behind 2012. Five of the ten warmest years recorded in Central Park have occurred in the last ten years.
