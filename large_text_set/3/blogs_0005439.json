He handles game situations very well and off the pitch, he is a spectacle because of his professionalism.\" \nModric joined the club in 2012 and has yet to help Madrid to a league title, but Zidane stressed the veteran playmaker's importance to his squad, saying: \"I don't often say it, but his team-mates love him very much.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:58:19.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
