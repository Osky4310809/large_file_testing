(Photo: Janet Van Ham, HBO) \nBill Maher’s concerns about Donald Trump’s presidency go far beyond the business of jokes. \n“We’re entering a different era in the world, so I think comedy has to take a back seat to that. I think we’re entering a different everything and no one knows what’s going to happen,” says Maher, who opens Season 15 of HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher — with a new intro and set — just hours after Trump’s inauguration today (10 ET/PT). \nHe wonders about Trump’s penchant for lashing out at critics and how that might affect outspoken comedians. \n“What’s consistent is how much he loves (Vladimir) Putin. But he has attacked everybody else,” Maher says. “He attacked the Pope, he attacked the chick from Twilight , he went after (civil rights icon) John Lewis on Martin Luther King” weekend, he says. “If you attack him, he’s like a mean girl at a sleepover. He just wants to get back at you.” \nBased on Trump’s attacks on the press and statements advocating opening up libel laws, Maher worries about how the new president will respond to critics. Bill Maher finally scores sit-down interview with President Obama \n“I thought that we all lived in a country where free speech is accepted. But Donald Trump doesn’t accept the concept of free speech,” says Maher, who was sued by Trump in 2013 after offering to donate $5 million to charity if the billionaire could prove he wasn’t the son of an orangutan (The suit was withdrawn.). \nThe presidential shift will be quite dramatic, says Maher, who interviewed President Obama just before the election. \n“I think he did a great job as president, but (the interview) did remind me he ain’t no radical. I don’t know what the right wing was so worried about,” says Maher, who donated $1 million to an Obama Super PAC in 2012. \nBill Maher, left, talks to U.S. Sen.

(Jane Fonda is tonight’s first interview guest, with commentator Keith Olbermann as the mid-show interview guest and a roundtable that includes economic-equality advocate Heather McGhee, presidential historian Jon Meacham and departing U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez.) \n“I can’t be me and do my job and satisfy my audience without speaking openly and freely,” he says. \nOn a comedic level, he says it may be difficult to top Trump's comments. Punchlines: It's the FBI all over again \n“He goes beyond parody all the time. He’s so ridiculous that some days you go, ‘What could I possibly add to that?’ ” he says. “But I’m not going to lie. It’s great for business. People want to see this man lampooned. Most of the country didn’t vote for him. Most of the country doesn’t like him. I haven’t seen liberals this angry in a long time.” \nBut Maher will criticize fellow liberals, too. \n“I’ve always tried to go by being a truth-teller as opposed to being a team player. I tell the liberals when they have spinach on their teeth,” says Maher, who blames political correctness for the Democrats’ loss. “If you listen to any Trump voter, the first thing they always say about Donald Trump is, ‘We know he’s crude, but we know he’s not politically correct.’ We have been choking on this political correctness for a long time.” \nMaher enjoys talking to – and arguing with – people who disagree with him. He recalls giving a platform to a group of rising conservatives, including Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, on Politically Incorrect . \"I'm a little bit proud of her, but, boy, I certainly don't appreciate what she's helping her boss do to the country.\" 224 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k9j90Y NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
