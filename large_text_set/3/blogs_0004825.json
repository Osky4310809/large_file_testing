Just another terrible decision!” Trump said in a morning tweet. \nIt appears to reference reports from Monday that a former Guantanamo Bay detainee was killed on March 2 by a US airstrike authorized by Trump at an al-Qaeda outpost in Yemen.\nThe Pentagon confirmed the death of Yasir al-Silmi who was released in 2009 by former President Obama.\nIn Obama’s first campaign for the White House, he pledged to shut down the terror detention center immediately after coming into office. But instead of it closing, Obama released many of the detainees over the next 8 years.\nTrump, by contrast, pledged to fill Gitmo back up. \n“This morning, I watched President Obama talking about Gitmo, right, Guantanamo Bay, which by the way, which by the way, we are keeping open. Which we are keeping open … and we’re gonna load it up with some bad dudes, believe me, we’re gonna load it up,” he said last February.\nIt’s unclear what prompted Trump’s outburst Tuesday.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:41:17.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
