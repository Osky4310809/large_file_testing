Center.\nRandall Bolton, 31, was charged with fourth-degree assault, disorderly conduct, terroristic threatening and trespassing, said Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley. \nVideo of fan being removed from court pic.twitter.com/Rnb6YyeUzB \n— Lou Sports Network (@CardsRadio) February 11, 2017 Bolton ran onto the court from the stands during a timeout, made contact with one of the University of Louisville dancers, and then attempted to make his way into the Miami team huddle. \n\"There was a little bit of a commotion in our huddle,\" Miami coach Jim Larranaga said after the game. \"I glanced up, and there was someone there in our huddle, I believe in red. We don't normally wear red.\"\nFans near the court reported that Bolton appeared to be shouting something as he was restrained by police, but nobody seemed to be able to make out what it was. No one was harmed during the incident. \nLouisville erased a seven-point halftime deficit in the game to top Miami and claim its 20th victory of the season.
