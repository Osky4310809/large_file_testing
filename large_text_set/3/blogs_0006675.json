Dabbling in drug use has become “a little more socially acceptable” as long as it doesn’t hurt performance, Alpert tells ThinkAdvisor. \nMales are also compulsively paying for sex at local massage parlors. Their drug use and paid sex can be part of thrill-seeking behavior, Alpert says. \nAlpert coaches clients on how to perform at a high level without relying heavily on drugs. He also provides treatment for anxiety as well as stress- and relationship-management. \nMeanwhile, some Wall Street banks are “now somewhat more friendly toward providing [mental health] services and just being more supportive,” Alpert tells ThinkAdvisor.
