She's been quite badly injured by the attack,\" Butler said. \nIMF chief Christine Lagarde said the organisation was \"working closely\" with French authorities to investigate the incident. \n\"I condemn this cowardly act of violence and reaffirm the IMF's resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate,\" Lagarde said. \nFrench President Francois Hollande said authorities would go \"all the way\" to find those responsible.
