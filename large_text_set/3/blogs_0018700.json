Other than the video of the elderly woman’s iCloud account being broken into, there has been no evidence shared with the media to suggest that the hackers’ claims of having gained access to a large database of Apple usernames and passwords are legitimate.\nHowever, if it’s true that the hackers are attempting to engage with the media in an attempt to increase their chances of a substantial payout then that would be in line with an increasingly common technique deployed by extortionists.\nFor instance, we have discussed before how an individual hacker or hacking group known as The Dark Overlord has targeted investment banks – stealing internal documents and bringing them to the public’s attention in an attempt to extort more money.\nIn another extortion attempt, The Dark Overlord stole hundreds of gigabytes of files from the Gorilla Glue adhesive company , and attempted to increase their chances of crowbarring more money out of corporate victims by sharing details with security industry media. For the record, when The Dark Overlord contacted me to help them blackmail companies, I declined .\nI believe that companies should do everything in their power to protect their customers and prevent criminals from profiting from extortion.\nWe simply don’t know the truth of the Turkish Crime Family’s claims, and whether Apple users are at risk.\nBut I do hope that the media stories will help remind Apple users of the importance of using a strong, unique password to secure their account and enable two-factor authentication to make their accounts harder to break into.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T15:49:20.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
