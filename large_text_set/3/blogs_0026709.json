Use these to impress your friends over the weekend. \nKrispy Kreme has made our world a better place in so many ways. Becoming famous for misspelling words that start with a \"c\" long before the Kardashians did it, Krispy Kreme also gave us the Sloppy Joe doughnut . (Yes, it's a thing!) Here are some more mouth-watering facts about the doughnut shop. The Recipe is a Secret \n(source) \nKrispy Kreme isn't a secret family recipe, even though it is a secret. Founder Vernon Rudolph purchased the signature Krispy Kreme recipe off of a New Orleans chef before he started making them back in Winston-Salem, NC. That recipe is carefully guarded in a vault in the same Krispy Kreme factory that makes the dry mix used by every Krispy Kreme in the country. Krispy Kreme goes to great lengths to keep this recipe secret, and even waged war against one New York-based location after they began supplying unofficial Krispy Kreme donuts to a \"rogue operation\" in New Jersey. Don't mess with big doughnut! Rudolph \"Advertised\" Using the Doughnut's Scent \n(source) \nWhen Rudolph founded Krispy Kreme, he made his donuts in a factory, then sold those donuts directly to grocery stores. But the aroma of the donuts emanating from his factory was so mouth watering, that it would lure in people off of the street. Rudolph soon cut a hole in the wall of his factory and began selling them off the street. How does that old saying go? Scents sells? Someone Made a $1,685 Krispy Kreme Doughnut \n(source) \nA London department store once sold a Krispy Kreme doughnut that went for $1,685. It was topped with a 23-carat gold-dusted Belgian white chocolate lotus flower and was filled with Dom Preignon champagne jelly. Oh, and it also had edible diamonds. Because sometimes you have so many diamonds you're like, \"What should I do with all of these diamonds? I guess I'll eat some of them\"? The Largest Box of Krispy Kremes Held 2,700 Donuts \n(source) \nThe largest box of donuts was created by the Kuwait Food Co. Americana in 2009. It's a replica of the normal, smaller Krispy Kreme box, except that it can hold 2,700 donuts. It measures 19' x 13' x 3' and weighs almost 300 pounds. Not only does it hold 2,700 donuts, but it also holds the Guinness World Record for largest box of donuts. So who holds the record for largest cup of coffee to go with it? There's an App That Tells You When the Hot Now Light is On \n(source) \nKrispy Kreme is famous for their \"hot now\" light, which lets you know when those babies are fresh out of the oven. But now you don't have to sit outside of your local Krispy Kreme just waiting for that red, neon light to pop on â€” there's an app that tells you when a fresh batch is ready to go. It therefore also tells you when you're going to break your diet. \nDo these facts make you hungry for donuts?
