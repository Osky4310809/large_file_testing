In the official release a glitch would cause the 1080p resolution to display at 900p then stretch it to 1080p. This mod fixes that, so you can enjoy Platinum Games' latest opus in all its visual splendor. \nAnother flaw in the official release was the framerate, which would frequently drop to under 60fps even on very powerful rigs. Kaldaien's mod optimises this too. \nAccording to several commenters on Reddit , the fan-made patch seems to work fairly well. \nInstalling the mod requires players to switch their game to the \"Testing\" branch, then, once in game, hit Ctrl+Shift+Backspace to bring up the settings menu. From here, reduce Global Illumination workgroup from 64 to 16. \nHopefully you'll have some luck with it as Nier: Automata is an astonishing game - and one that deserves to be played long after the end credits .
