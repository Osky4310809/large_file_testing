The Trump nominee simply replied, “42.” \nThe Texas Republican followed up by wondering, “Could you explain what it is to which we’re referencing?” \nGorsuch explained that he sometimes uses the question in his courtroom to “put [people] at ease.” He continued that “they all know the answer, and they all know the answer because they’ve all read Douglas Adams’s ‘Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’.” \nThe Supreme Court nominee then gave the book a ringing endorsement: “If you haven’t read it, you should. It may be one of my daughter’s favorite books. And so, that’s a family joke.” \nCruz revealed that “it is a book that I’ve very much enjoyed as well.” He added that “it is, I think, a delightful example of the humanity of a judge that your record has demonstrated.” \n[image via screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
