Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com \nSt. Luke's Hospital in 1905 \nSt. Louis development officials are considering two proposals to renovate the former St. Luke’s Hospital on Delmar Boulevard as offices, apartments and stores. \nMost recently the old hospital at 5535 Delmar was the site of St. Louis ConnectCare, which filed for bankruptcy in 2013. The city’s Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority owns the vacant building complex. \nBehind one of the redevelopment proposals is Maxine Clark , founder and retired chief executive of Build-A-Bear Workshop, and Bob Clark , chairman and chief executive of Clayco Corp. Their proposed project is called Delmar Divine. \nThe other proposal, called Grand Missourian International, is from Prad Sabharwal , managing director of Ananta Advisors, an international real estate investment firm based in St. Louis. \nSabharwal and Bob Clark, who is not related to Maxine Clark, made separate presentations about their projects Jan. 24 at a two-hour closed meeting of the LCRA board. Otis Williams, executive director of the St. Louis Development Corp., said afterward the board will get more information before deciding which project to support. \nBoth projects propose renovation of the existing buildings. \nGrand Missourian International plans include apartments, a movie theater and workshops for makers of clothing, home furnishings and other items. Among the firms involved in the proposal is Tropicana Leisure Hospitality, an international resort developer based in Mumbai, India. \nThe project would produce 500 jobs, according to the presentation to the LCRA board. \nSabharwal declined this week to discuss his project. He said through a spokesman he would speak about the plan after the LCRA board selects one of the proposals. \nAn aspect of both plans is a potential St. Louis home of Teach for America, a nationwide organization that places new college graduates as teachers in inner-city schools. Teach for America currently has 80 teachers in St. Louis, according to the organization’s website. Maxine Clark is a member of the group’s local and national boards. \nShe said some of Delmar Divine’s 160 apartments could provide affordable housing for Teach for America participants. \nClark, who has focused on education issues since retiring from Build-A-Bear in 2013, said Delmar Divine could be a base of operations for nonprofit organizations unable to afford pricier offices. She said she began considering such a project years ago and recruited Bob Clark, a longtime acquaintance, to the effort. \n“We’re both get-it-done people,” she said. \nClark said their project’s name is a reference to the “Delmar divide,” the oft-cited description of the race-and-wealth line that splits the city between the mostly poor and nearly all black north and the wealthier, mostly white south. \nDelmar Divine could help erase the divide, said Clark, adding that it could prompt redevelopment north toward the KIPP: Victory Academy elementary school on Arcade Avenue and Better Family Life’s housing renovation project in the Page Boulevard area. \nClark is chief executive of the Clark-Fox Family Foundation, which aims — in its words — to “fund the future of St. Louis through education, community initiatives, and economic development.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T22:09:28.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
