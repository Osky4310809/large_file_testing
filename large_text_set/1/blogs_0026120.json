As is common with the King.com games, players can play on their own without needing to connect with their friends. However, challenging your Facebook friends and sharing your achievements with them will bring you certain benefits that you will eventually need if you want to keep progressing. The first version of Candy Crush Soda Saga has 75 different levels where you have to match candies, gummies, and other sweets in order to make them disappear from the board. The goal, as always, is to get three stars on each level, which will allow you to get all kinds of gifts. Visually speaking, Candy Crush Soda Saga has the same esthetics that made Candy Crush Saga so famous. In other words, it has simple, lovely, very colorful designs that will enchant both kids and adults. Candy Crush Soda Saga is an entertaining game. Though it doesn't offer many challenges, it does suck its users in thanks to its simple, easy-to-learn mechanics. Requirements \nRequires Android 2.2 or later.
