The singer and the song topped it off with a touch of class. Nessun Dorma: None Shall Sleep. Just right. \nI was at the King Power Stadium on Sunday and a lot of people were doing a lot of sleeping. The home crowd were drowsy; so were their team who have failed to score a league goal in 2017. Watch highlights of Leicester 0-3 Manchester Utd \nLeicester were doing a lot of the things they did last year, they just weren't doing them so well. They gave Manchester United a lot of possession while looking to score on the quick break. United helped themselves to three goals with the possession they were given but it could have been more. Leicester had started well enough but by the time the second goal had been celebrated they were dead men walking. \nOne of the questions running about the stadium was whether Claudio Ranieri is also a dead man walking now. Newspapers have carried rumours of players going upstairs to speak to their chairman about Ranieri. \nA few years ago when some Sunderland players went upstairs to express concern about what they saw as the zanier aspects of Paolo di Canio's reign as a former Sunderland player and chairman I understood. Yet if I was the chairman of Leicester City and the players came to me complaining about Ranieri I would run them out the door. \nOf course Leicester's form this year means that people are going to re-evaluate how good they actually were last season. They won the Premier League by 10 points though, having started the year as 5,000/1 shots. Leicester defied the odds to lift the Premier League trophy last season \nRanieri was a good enough manager to keep the collective cool at Leicester when more celebrated managers at other clubs were losing theirs. Don't forget there were periods when people fancied almost all of the traditional contenders but eventually we settled on Spurs as the team most likely to benefit when Leicester fell apart. \nIt never happened. Spurs lost their nerve too. \nRanieri will always be a colossal part of the history of Leicester City football club. As such he has earned the right to see out this battle. \nIn front of the Sky Sports cameras on Sunday, Leicester's attacks were toothless and predictable. The defence was pretty limp too. In midfield things were a bit different from last year. Looking at N'Golo Kante on the way to what looks like being a second successive Premier League medal in two season of English football, you can't help wondering if Leicester sold the engine of their success to Chelsea. Suddenly £32m looks like a bargain. Claudio Ranieri's future has been plunged into doubt \nLeicester now find themselves one point above the relegation zone. In the group most worried about the trapdoor Hull, Sunderland and Swansea have shown signs of a pulse recently. Leicester are still in the Champions League with a tie against Sevilla and still in the FA Cup with Derby County coming to visit on Wednesday. There is still a chance that they can make something of their season. \nAfter the game yesterday Kasper Schmeichel gave a frank TV interview. I remember doing something similar myself when I was at Manchester City and we were in dire trouble. I wish Kasper better luck than I had. \nHis intention was to draw a response, to wake his team from their slumber. He said all the right things. He refused comment on rumours of a delegation going upstairs to undermine Ranieri. He said that last season is dead and gone. It was time to stop thinking about it. He said his team-mates needed to \"stand up and be counted because this season from top to bottom hasn't been good enough… we are reigning champions and quite frankly it's been embarrassing\". Kasper Schmeichel labelled Leicester 'embarrassing' after their Super Sunday loss \nHis dressing room should listen. I passed the players' car park on the way in and the way out of the stadium yesterday. Even by Premier League standards the quality of vehicles there was impressive. It didn't look like a place for the lean and hungry; it smacked of, 'Look how well I've done'. \nAnd it isn't even two years since these Leicester stars were in a far worse situation. At the start of April 2015 they were anchored at the bottom of the Premier League with seven points between them and safety.
