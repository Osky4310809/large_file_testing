She additionally wore a Planned Parenthood logo on her lapel. \nShe also sported an armband that featured the bedazzled red word \"Persist,\" which alluded to the \"nevertheless, she persisted\" reprimand that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated against Sen. Elizabeth Warren in early February when explaining the Republican majority's decision to block Warren from speaking further on Jeff Session's confirmation hearing for attorney general.\nHis statement \"she persisted\" was taken up by the feminist cause. \nStyled by Jamie Mizrahi, Perry performed her latest popular single with Bob Marley's grandson Skip Marley, behind a theatrical fence. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the on-stage fence was part of Perry's statement against President Donald Trump's ban on muslims from seven countries and his desire to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. \nPerry wrapped up her performance with a shout of \"No hate!\" as the U.S. Constitution was projected behind Marley and her as the two held hands together.  \nHer song's lyrics also struck a defiant tone that went along with the theme of her performance, particularly the hook of \"so comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble / so comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble.\" \nThe lyrics of the song later communicate: \"Are we tone deaf? / Keep sweeping it under the mat... / Thought we could do better than that / I hope we can\"\nThe singer's Grammy Awards 2017 performance is in line with her support for liberal political causes in recent months. She was an unabashed supporter of Hillary Clinton throughout the campaign run-up to the election in November. \nShe and boyfriend Orlando Bloom pulled off the look and appearance of the Clinton couple on Halloween last year when they wore costumes of the famous political pair. \nMoreover, Perry commented right after the election that Clinton \"lit a fire inside of me that burns brighter and brighter every day.\" It's clear Perry will continue to make political statements in favor of her favorite liberal causes. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:54:03.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
