Experts believe that the leading playback singer possesses a “high octave vocal range”. Understandably, her “high-energy singing” has been lent to many actresses who have gone to perform those chart-topping numbers at TRP-inducing award functions. In fact, what has left the music lovers stunned is her ability to transition from the higher octaves to the lower ones and vice versa. Anyone with even a mild understanding of music would know that dropping notes is considered a definitive benchmark of quality singing. sunidhichauhan/via Instagram But, few know about her high-octave battles in personal life. \nAt the age of 18, Sunidhi married director-choreographer, Bobby Khan. This news came in the heels of her blossiming career in Bollywood. Much of the reportage revolved around her parents’ disapproval of the match and her resolve to still go ahead with it. As it is with any Bollywood marriage, it was followed closely till the announcement of her separation broke. As a newly-retired teenager (yes, she was that young), Sunidhi had tackled divorce, while also managing a career in the always-dwindling Bollywood industry. sunidhichauhan/via Instagram \nIn 2002, the Indian society was steadily coming to terms with its millennium hangover. The Y2K generation was only starting to initiate a dialogue about usually-hushed subjects. Divorce was obviously one of them. A divorced woman wasn’t exactly viewed objectively. So, instead, Sunidhi drew avoidable sympathy for stepping out of a failed relationship. As a young girl, who married too soon by the benchmark of the post-millennium India, and divorced too soon by the benchmark of the same society that wasn’t as modern, Sunidhi was poised to be at the receiving end of conflicting views. All she had with her, was her talent and a second chance, if she was willing to take one. And she did. sunidhichauhan/via Instagram \nSunidhi made an exemplary career out of her second chance. She went on to lend her name to a record-breaking 2000 songs, a significant portion of which include award-winning chartbusters. We’ve instinctively picked on her voice when the likes of Madhuri Dixit, Bipasha Basu, Katrina Kaif or now-reigning Kangana Ranaut have lip-synced to her. Sunidhi also became the first Indian female singer to collaborate with pop sensation, Enrique Iglesias for the Hindi version of the song, Heartbeat. Oh, and have we told you that she can sing in Bengali, Bhojpuri, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odiya, Tamil & Telugu, too? sunidichauhan/via Instagram But, most of all, in a clapback to all the non-believers, she found love … again …amidst all her resounding success. \nWe tend to undermine second chances, sometimes even deprive ourselves of them believing that we don’t deserve them. Sunidhi didn’t let a failed relationship become her only sustaining reality. She replaced it with her powerful voice and told the world, “Watch me”! Or in her case, “Hear me”! sunidichauhan/via Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:05:12.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
