It started with unicorn-horn makeup brushes and iridescent lipstick , and now the mythical creature seems to be invading bath time, as there's a wealth of unicorn-themed bath bombs on the market. The latest addition to the plethora of mythical beauty goodies? Why, unicorn soap, of course.\nEarthsRawBeauty , which specializes in all-natural homemade bath treats, quickly went viral for its recently launched colorful soaps. Crafted with skin-loving ingredients like goat milk, coconut oil, and shea butter, these unicorn soaps are scented with a tantalizing blend of berries, apples, peaches, and kumquat. Yum! If you needed any proof that unicorns are actually good for you and your skin, these soaps should do the trick.\nThe woman behind the company, Carmen Iclodean, first started making her Believe in Magic soaps in the shape of an actual unicorn, complete with a rainbow mane and all. Then she tried experimenting with an equally as colorful bar version that includes a cute golden horn. Both soaps are pretty darn adorable â€” so adorable, in fact, that they quickly went out of stock. Bummer!\nAs of March 16, EarthsRawBeauty isn't accepting preorders , but while you patiently await the next stock to be ready, read on to see what these gorgeous soaps look like IRL.\nRelated:\nThis Is When the Viral Unicorn Bath Bomb Will Be Available For Sale\nPrevious Next", "external_links": ["https://www.earthsrawbeauty.com/product/believe-magic-pre-order/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BRq_5u0hmeU/?taken-by=earthsrawbeauty"], "published": "2017-03-16T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:12:21.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
