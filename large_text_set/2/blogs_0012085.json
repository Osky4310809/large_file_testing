Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger to resign from Trump’s economic advisory council. The reason: Trump’s controversial statements and policies, particularly on immigration.\nAlmost 400,000 signatures have been collected on online petitions calling for Iger to dump Trump, an Organize Florida representative said. On Tuesday, activists dropped off printed copies of the petitions’ electronic signatures at a Disney corporate office.\nThen the activists took to the streets, with several dozen people gathering outside a Walt Disney World entrance for a rally.\nProtesters carried signs and chanted slogans sprinkled with Disney pop culture references.\n“Wall-E, not Walls!” “The Force is not with Donald Trump.” “Donald Duck, not Donald Trump!”\nDisney World representatives did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe organization causing the public-relations headache for Iger is called the the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. Trump appointed the panel, consisting of about 15 present and former corporate leaders, last year shortly after his election.\nPressure has been on some of those executives to quit after Trump’s executive order temporarily banned nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States,. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick announced his departure this month after complaints from employees and customers.\nIger skipped the council’s first meeting this month. Disney said he had to attend a previously scheduled company board meeting.\nPeople attending Tuesday’s event pointed out Disney is a company that celebrates diversity and is seen as a symbol of American values.\n“Disney’s success is built on the back of immigrants,” said Rasha Mubarak, with the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Florida, speaking to the crowd.\nOther speakers included farmworker activist Tirso Moreno and Angela McKinnon, a longtime Disney foodservice worker who is now the financial secretary and treasurer for Unite Here! Local 737.\nTrump’s policies are “so against Disney’s values,” McKinnon said before the protest. “It’s against my values and Central Florida values. For Iger to stay on that board, it’s not a good thing.”\nGot a news tip? spedicini@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5240; Twitter @SandraPedicini\nCaption Disney sets 'Rivers of Light' debut and replaces 'Wishes' fireworks show “Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\n“Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\nCaption Disney sets 'Rivers of Light' debut and replaces 'Wishes' fireworks show “Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\n“Rivers of Light,” the first nighttime spectacular planned for Disney’s Animal Kingdom, will debut Feb. 17, Walt Disney World announced Thursday morning.\nCaption Ticket prices are increasing at Disney theme parks General admission prices are set to increase at Walt Disney World theme parks starting Sunday.\nGeneral admission prices are set to increase at Walt Disney World theme parks starting Sunday.\nCaption Lawsuit alleges injury on Disney's PeopleMover ride Two sisters have sued Disney Parks and Resorts, alleging they sustained injuries on the Magic Kingdom’s Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover.\nTwo sisters have sued Disney Parks and Resorts, alleging they sustained injuries on the Magic Kingdom’s Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover.\nCaption Disney reveals opening dates for Avatar and Star Wars Lands During an earnings call, Disney revealed that the Avatar Land would open May 27 and Star Wars land will open in 2019.\nDuring an earnings call, Disney revealed that the Avatar Land would open May 27 and Star Wars land will open in 2019.\nCaption Get immersed in the arts at new Epcot festival - Theme Park Ranger The Epcot International Festival of the Arts focuses on visual arts, performing arts and culinary arts.
