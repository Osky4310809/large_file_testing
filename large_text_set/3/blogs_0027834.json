It can give an individual, and in turn, a side, the spunk required to turn around fortunes, as seen in the case of Bangladesh, who made their 100th Test a memorable one by beating Sri Lanka for the first time in the longest format of the game. What the win also did was strengthen the sense of belief in a side that has scaled more than a mere few accolades over the last two years. \nOn Saturday (March 25), at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla, Bangladesh reinforced the significance of that confidence and momentum carried forward from the Test series that they drew 1-1, as they beat Sri Lanka convincingly by 90 runs after setting them a record 325 to win in the first of three One-Day Internationals. Led by a brilliant knock of 127 off 142 balls from Tamim Iqbal, Bangladesh took a 1-0 lead in the series after bowling Sri Lanka out for 234. This was the first time that Bangladesh have successfully defended a total against Sri Lanka; their other wins have come chasing. \nDuring the course of his century, Tamim became the first Bangladesh cricketer to amass over 10,000 international runs, notching the highest-ever score by a Bangladesh batsman against Sri Lanka. In addition, Shakib Al Hasan (72) and Tamim's stand of 144 was also the highest-ever in an ODI between the two sides. \nSri Lanka who were without the services of Angelo Mathews, Lasith Malinga, due to injury, and Niroshan Dickwella, who was suspended, never really were in the chase to begin with. In order to scale a total of that magnitude, they needed a good start at the top. Danushka Gunathilaka falling leg before to skipper Mashrafe Mortaza off the third ball of the innings set the tone for the visitors. The other standout difference between the sides was fielding, with Bangladesh displaying immense intensity and commitment in contrast to Sri Lanka's insipid performance. \nMehedi Hasan, who was handed his debut cap, troubled the Sri Lankans from the outset, beating the bat on a couple of occasions. The batsmen struggled as they failed to read him. Skipper Upul Tharanga survived a close stumping chance, but he was rewarded in the sixth over when Kusal Mendis hit out straight to deep midwicket as Sri Lanka were reeling at 15 for 2. At the end of the 15th over, the required run-rate had soared over 8, and Sri Lanka were 43 for 3 in contrast to Bangladesh's 89 for 1 at the same stage. The loss of regular wickets didn't help their cause. \nDinesh Chandimal (59) and Asela Gunratne (24) added 56 runs for the fourth wicket, but the pair departed within five overs of each other. Sachith Pathirana (31) and Milinda Siriwardana (22) added a few runs, but it was Thisara Perera's cameo that could've exuded hope for Sri Lanka, who needed 122 off the last 10 overs. Despite his valiant knock of 55 off 35, that kept Sri Lanka in the chase for longer than anticipated, it was all too much to ask for from the hosts. \nEarlier, Sabbir Rahman started cautiously after Soumya Sarkar departed for 10, taking nine balls to get his first run. But once he did, with a boundary, there was no looking back as the dynamic youngster went on to add 90 runs for the second wicket with Tamim, en route his fourth one-day fifty. While Sabbir took on the role of the aggressor, Tamim was happy to play second fiddle in the stand. Sabbir scored 54 as the pair led Bangladesh to 64 for 1 in ten overs, setting the tone for the innings. \nOf Sabbir's 54 runs (off 56 balls), 40 came in boundaries before he was sent back after Tharanga pulled off a screamer at short extra cover, giving Asela Gunaratne a wicket in his first over. As is often seen, one brought another for Sri Lanka, with the in-form Mushfiqur Rahim departing in the next over for 1 after Sandakan took a sharp return catch. \nTamim and Shakib thereafter took on the responsibility of rebuilding and rather well, as the former brought up his 35th ODI fifty. The pair went on to add a century stand for the fourth wicket, which was the most number of runs the pair have ever added in ODIs. Bangladesh's run-rate that was hovering around the six-run mark, dipped as Tamim approached his century. \nHowever, a feature of their stand was the effective rotating of strike and aggressive running, albeit minus the boundaries. While Tamim brought up his eighth ODI century, Shakib scored his 33rd ODI fifty soon enough. Shakib's innings had only the one boundary at that point. However, three successive fours off Kumara for Shakib took Bangladesh to 256 for 3 with five overs to go. Shakib's acceleration post his fifty saw him race away from 50 off 61 balls to 72 off 71 before being caught out by Sandakan at short fine leg, ending a mammoth stand as Bangladesh already had their highest total against Sri Lanka. Tamim did well to ensure Bangladesh didn't lose fizz after that as he accelerated before he was finally caught out at long on by Gunathilaka. \nIf the widths offered by the Sri Lankan bowlers did them in early on, it was the lengths towards the end. The last ten overs fetched Bangladesh 109 runs as they finished strong thanks to lusty late blows from Mahmudullah (13* off 7) and Mosaddek Hossain Saikat (24* off 9). \nBrief scores : Bangladesh 324/5 in 50 overs (Tamim Iqbal 127, Sabbir Rahman 54, Shakib Al Hasan 72; Suranga Lakmal 2-45) vs Sri Lanka 234 in 45.1 overs (Dinesh Chandimal 59, Thisara Perers 55; Mashrafe Mortaza 2-35, Mehedi Hasan 2-43, Mustafizur Rahman 3-56) by 90 runs. © Cricbuzz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T00:13:25.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
