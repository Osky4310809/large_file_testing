KENDALL JENNER IS QUEEN OF ALL SKY CREATURES! LISTEN TO HER GENTLE CALL AS SHE ALERTS THE ENTIRE BIRD COMMUNITY THAT SHE HAS BOOKED A CAMEO ON “THE LATE LATE SHOW.” \nThe news about Kendall’s bird skills came just moments after the entire world learned Andrew Garfield is surprisingly limber, completing a perfect backflip in front of the “Late Late Show” crowd. \nThe segment also featured Stevie Nicks doing some baton work and Taylor Lautner proving to us once and for all his mouth is just a grape vacuum at this point. \nJames Corden is a sort of guru when it comes to getting celebrities to expose all their weird talents they’ve been hiding from the masses. \n“Hidden Talents” is one of the best running segments in late night, and it’s VERY clear why. \nTake this edition for example. \nTERRY. FREAKING. CREWS. PLAYING. A. GODDAMN. FLUTE. \nWhat else do you want? WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?!?!?! \nOH, YOU WANT LUCY LIU DOING A SPLIT. \nBoom. Done. \nARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?
