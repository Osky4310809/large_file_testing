That's why I came here and did that.\"\nLater that night she was \"constantly ushering over\" waiters because she wanted pizza, reports Woman's Day. Her husband, singer Keith Urban, was then reportedly seen brushing pizza crumbs off her dress.\nThe Best Actress nominee also \"shooed away\" a cocktail waitress at one point.\nHer behavior led to \"some observers wondering whether she'd had a few too many pre-show wines,\" Woman's Day revealed, according to the Daily Mail.\nMore recently, Kidman was forced to clarify a comment she made about President-elect Donald Trump.\n\"I just say, [Trump's] now elected, and we as a country need to support whoever's the president because that's what the country's based on,\" she had said during an interview with the BBC, according to KIRO.\nAfter receiving backlash on social media, Kidman explained her statement to Access Hollywood.\n\"I was trying to stress that I believe in democracy and the American Constitution. It's that simple,\" she said. \"I'm just, I'm out of it now. That's what I said. It's that simple.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T19:20:09.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
