LED headlamps integrated into the design of the sculpted air intakes on the bonnet also emphasize that front muscle, integrating with, and wrapping around the front wheelarch. to mark the company’s 70th anniversary, the car is being launched in a new color, ‘rosso settanta’. \n\n\n\nthe interior architecture of the ‘812 superfast’ has been revisited inline with the more extreme exterior, while maintaining the exceptional on-board comfort and space that ferrari’s ‘berlinettas’ offer. the cabin has been given a sportier, more extroverted look with the main elements seeming to float, creating an effect of both thoroughbred racing eagerness and lean elegance. the horizontal dash loops stylishly around the central air vents for a sophisticated, sculptural look. new, more sporty and ergonomic seats feature alongside a new human-machine-interface: including a new steering wheel and instrument clusters, plus upgraded infotainment and air-conditioning units. \n\n\nat the rear, four round tail-lights inspired by ferrari tradition emphasize a design crafted around horizontal lines and give the ‘812 superfast’ a broad, imposing stance, visually lowering both spoiler and cabin. in true ferrari-fashion, style and aerodynamic function are seamlessly integrated to produce innovative solutions and forms. two examples are the multi-functional frontal section, which incorporates a cluster of aerodynamic solutions including active flaps at the front of the underbody, and the rear flank which features an aerodynamic by-pass to increase downforce. \n\n\na front-engined production vehicle hasn’t come near to delivering the sheer power of the 6.5 V12 engine’s power, underscored by a full, rich exhaust sound that exploits the acoustics delivered by its increased displacement. the ‘812 superfast’s’ dual-clutch transmission has specific gear ratios which, combined with shorter up and down-shifting times between gears, sharpening throttle responses further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T12:34:39.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
