There's an expletive-laden label for these types of players, but let's just call them a pain in the backside or, simply, nuisances. \nYou know the sort: They push the laws of the game to breaking point and can sometimes cross the line. We're talking histrionics, like when a player slams to the turf as if he's been hit by a crowbar when the TV replays show it was a mere brush of the hand. \nThey'll whinge throughout the 90 minutes, seemingly forever in the referee's ear. Or the offender will leave their studs in on a tackle on the sly before denying any knowledge of the incident. Man United's Marcos Rojo got a mid-match potassium boost in his side's 1-0 victory over Rostov in the UEFA Europa League. The guys answer your tweets on Romelu Lukaku's production, Hazard's form, Man United's season goals, and the state of MLS. \nIt is important to distinguish between a hard man -- someone who takes no prisoners in a challenge like former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane -- and those who have a more snide side to their game. \nKeane played in an era of Dennis Wise, Rivaldo, Craig Bellamy and Robbie Savage -- all impossible nuisances -- but are we losing these types of characters in the modern game? Are players becoming too nice? \nLet us know your thoughts on our XI -- which is restricted to just active players; five of whom have been managed by Jose Mourinho -- and the footballers you love to hate in the comments section below. \nPlayers fans love to hate XI: Joe Hart, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Marcos Rojo, Ander Herrera, Nigel de Jong, Sergio Busquets, Joey Barton, Luis Suarez, Jamie Vardy, Diego Costa. \nJames Dall is an associate editor at ESPN FC.
