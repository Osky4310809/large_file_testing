McGregor's not even a licensed boxer? \nYes and no. The Irishman was granted his license in California but not in Nevada, due largely to his outstanding punishment, but also because the process is more stringent. McGregor has never boxed professionally but did so as an amateur and given the huge sums of money involved, he is unlikely to be denied the right to fight.

The major stumbling block to McGregor taking on Mayweather is the Dubliner's contract with the UFC. He has five fights remaining on his current deal and that would take him to the end of 2018 at the earliest. By then, Mayweather will have been out of the ring for more than three years and his appetite would surely have waned.

No-one expects him to turn his back on the Octagon on a full-time basis, so this would have to be a one-off. That would mean sitting down with the UFC chiefs, including president Dana White, and thrashing out a compromise. Mayweather at the MGM Grand Garden Arena (Photo: Getty Images North America) What has White been saying about it? \nJust last weekend he said there was \"no chance\" the fight would happen, but several weeks ago he made Mayweather an offer of $25m (Â£20m) - probably knowing full well that wasn't nearly enough to tempt the retired boxer. White has grown the UFC into the behemoth it is today and doesn't want to see its name dragged through the mud, but at the same time, he must realise the money the organisation could make from the fight - and the potential boost to his company's profile. McGregor is currently the biggest name in MMA, especially given Ronda Rousey's latest KO defeat and Jon Jones' ban. Keeping the Irishman happy must be near the top of White's agenda. The UFC chief lives in Vegas, so the next few days could be interesting.

McGregor has already said he won't fight again until after the birth of his son in May, which would leave him with enough time for a camp. It also allows Mayweather time to return to his training routine, given he hasn't fought since 2015. McGregoof Ireland exits the Octagon after his victory over Jose Aldo (Photo: Getty) What weight would it be at? \nMcGregor has fought in three different weight classes in the UFC, at 145lb, 155lb and 170lb, while Mayweather finished his career at the boxing welterweight limit of 147lb. He did face Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez at a catchweight of 152lb so the smart money is on either of those latter two numbers. McGregor in the Octagon (Photo: Getty) Does it have to happen in Las Vegas? \nNo, but it's hard to see it taking place anywhere else. Mayweather has fought in his adopted home since 2005 and although there could be big-money offers from the Far East, Vegas is a safe bet. Since Mayweather retired, the T-Mobile Arena has opened as an alternative to the MGM Grand Garden Arena and is the most likely venue.
