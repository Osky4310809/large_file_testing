It’s hard to say. Your chances of being in a terrorist attack are probably a lot lower than the chances of losing your smartphone, so it’s not entirely far-fetched that people are more worried about the immediate effects losing their phone would have on their lives than a terrorist attack would. It doesn’t mean people wouldn’t find a terrorist attack extremely stressful in reality. \nThe moral of the story: As with most studies, take the results with a grain of salt. (But also maybe take a moment to reexamine your relationship with your phone.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T23:41:03.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
