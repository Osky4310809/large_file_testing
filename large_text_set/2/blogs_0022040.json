Original host Joel Hodgson tapped Nerdist favorite Jonah Ray to star as the latest hapless human forced to watch terrible movies for science, accompanied by his robot friends Crow and Tom Servo (voiced in the revival by comedian Hampton Yount and “Grace and Frankie” star Baron Vaughn). Terrorizing Jonah is Felicia Day as evil scientist Kinga Forrester, assisted by Patton Oswalt as TV’s Son of TV’s Frank. The writing staff for the revival includes Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland and plenty more . The series was just unveiled to fans at a recent series of screenings in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles — but the rest of the fans who made the series possible with their cash (as well as anyone with a Netflix account) will be able to check it out soon.
