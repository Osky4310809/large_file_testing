They will be passed on but not whilst he is in rehab. \n\"He has to focus on the task in hand... he is doing well and feeling pretty pleased with himself currently.\" \nMirrorOnline reported before Christmas that Gascoigne had been involved in an altercation at a hotel in Shoreditch in east London which resulted in him needing hospital treatment. A photo of Paul Gascoigne holding an England shirt was also published alongside it (Photo: Facebook / A1 Sporting Speakers) \nThen last week it emerged he had admitted himself to rehab. \nMr Baker added: \"Next week there will be news about the assault he suffered that kicked all of this off. \n\"There will be proof he was totally innocent and was viciously attacked from behind in an unprovoked incident. \n\"Hopefully there will be an announcement re the attacker as well.\" Paul Gascoigne with his agent Terry Baker (Photo: Facebook) \nMr Baker revealed last week how Gazza was seeking professional help to give up alcohol and “get free of his demons”. \nMr Baker said: “He hates being an alcoholic. \n“We hear often how similar he is to George Best . \n“Well we knew George really well and George was what you would tend to call a functioning alcoholic but he had no intention of ever giving up drinking. \n“When he had his liver transplant he stopped for a while but he enjoyed drinking, Paul hates it. \n“At all times Paul wants to be alcohol free but it is an addiction.\" Read More \nGascoigne, 49, earlier this month posted on Twitter he had been kicked down the stairs at a London hotel, fracturing his skull and breaking two fingers. \nThe former Newcastle United and Tottenham player, who won 57 England caps and was arguably the best footballer of his generation has been in rehab previously. Gazza has been in rehab before - but is determined says his agent (Photo: A1 Sporting Speakers) \nDespite pledging to kick booze has fallen off the wagon on several occasions. \nIn 2013 he was flown to a clinic in Arizona, US, after videos showed him slurring at a charity event. \nMr Baker defended himself by suggesting he is in fact “helping” Gazza by taking him on a tour of live shows where Gascoigne speaks to a live studio audience. Gazza gained worldwide fame at the 1990 World Cup (Photo: Getty) Read More \nHe told BBC Radio Five Live: “He’s doing pretty good. In fact I would say he’s the best he’s been since 2015. \n“That’s mainly because he’s chosen to go into rehab and he wants it. \nFirst of all he loves doing the shows. We only do about 15 a year. We drive him all over the country. \n“If it’s in Scotland we will drive him to Scotland, where he is loved by the Glasgow Rangers fans, we will do the show and come home. \n“We have a laugh all the way there, we have a laugh all the way back. He loves being on the stage, it’s the closest he gets to being a footballer again with the adulation and the people chanting his name. Read More \n“He has to make a living. He can’t afford to pay his rent with out making a living. \n“There’s no one waving a wand and making him have money and he needs to earn a living. \n“It’s the only way he can make a living. \n“Television doesn’t pay very much for the odd appearance and television is far more pressure for him than doing the live shows, he loves doing the live shows. \n“He enjoys doing it very much indeed. It gets him away from the monotony of life and it’s what he wants to do.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T16:31:42.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
