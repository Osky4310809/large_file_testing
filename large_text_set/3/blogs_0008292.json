The corps member serving in Nasara Standard Academy, Kaura Namada, Kaura Local Government Area of Zamfara State, further disclosed that he was detained along with the school principal, Aliu Sanusi, for over eight hours at the Area Police Command, Kaura Namada. The incident which happened last week Wednesday resulted in Uwakwe’s redeployment by the National Youth Service Corps management to another state for security reason. Uwakwe, 27, is a Mechanical Engineering graduate of the Institute of Management and Technology. He taught Basic Science and Physics in the junior and senior classes respectively. He had asked the JSS 3 students to write a test. In response, a girl identified as Nana Sadil-Liman hissed repeatedly. He said, “After she hissed the first time, I ignored her, then she hissed again. I now asked why she was hissing, she didn’t answer. Then, I told her to kneel down. I went to her desk and took her answer script and saw where she wrote, ‘This is nonsense test.’ “I asked her why she wrote this, she said nothing. So I asked her to crawl on her kneels round the assembly ground.” The corps member said he narrated the incident to his colleagues and also showed them what the girl wrote on her answer script, adding that he went to the library shortly after. Out of curiosity, his colleagues, he said, went to the class to see the girl, but they could not locate her and her brother. “After some minutes, someone came to meet me in the library that the school principal wanted to see me. When I came out, I saw a vehicle parked in front of the staff room and the principal asked me to follow them but I refused because I didn’t know who they were or where they were taking me to. “The principal then volunteered to go with me. So they took us to the police station and two policemen beat me with their fists and koboko. Then they asked me to remove my shoes and my belt which I did. They took me and the principal to the Area Commander and we were detained for more than eight hours,” Uwakwe narrated. He said the Area Commander asked him to write a statement and also directed the school principal to set up a committee that would apologise to Nana’s father for the punishment meted to his daughter. Uwakwe said the matter was subsequently taken up by the NYSC in the state which complained to the state Commissioner of Police. The Commissioner of Police berated the police for detaining me, saying the matter should have been resolved amicably, he said. The NYSC Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Bose Aderibigbe, confirmed the incident, saying Uwakwe had been redeployed to a state in the East for security reason. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
