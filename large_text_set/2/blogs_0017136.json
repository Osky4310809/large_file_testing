All this tough guy, breathy, growling, mumbling, I can't understand you!\" Image copyright Twitter/Wendy Coke-Sy \nTV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC: \"We are living in astonishingly ambitious times for TV drama, attracting world class talent to the small screen, and sometimes this means the basics of storytelling get slightly overlooked - either in terms of audibility or making a story too complicated or difficult to follow (as Sherlock was criticised for). \n\"However, it does feel that mumbling is the latest bandwagon for BBC bashers to jump on and the odd muffled word gets spun into a story. Actually, my enjoyment of SS-GB wasn't marred by sound issues.\" Image copyright Twitter/Chris Bennion \nIt's not the first time the issue of mumbling on TV dramas has been raised, with past programmes such as Jamaica Inn and Happy Valley having hit the headlines over the audio. \nBack in 2013, the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, told the Radio Times: \"I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man but I think muttering is something we could look at.\" \nSome have blamed actors, while others have pointed the finger at flat-screen televisions, which don't have the depth to encase larger speakers. \nSpeaking on the Today programme , ITV's Victoria creator, Daisy Goodwin, pointed out that Riley may have made a conscious choice to not speak with perfectly clear diction in keeping with his character. \nSS-GB, a five-part drama, also stars Kate Bosworth as a US journalist for the New York Times. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
