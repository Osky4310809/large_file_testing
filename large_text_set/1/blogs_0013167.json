Deirdre Connolly with Andy Cohen Courtesy of Bravo \n“We kept getting these updates, ‘She’s here,’‘she’s not here yet,’‘she’s in the car,’‘she’s getting out of the car,’ so it was sort of all these miscommunications, but Andy gets a charge out that,” Connolly said. “When you’re doing something every day and something throws you a curve ball, it kind of gives you adrenaline and he really feeds of that and it doesn’t faze him.” \nWhen the embattled pop star made her grand entrance three minutes past 11, she strutted in as if nothing was amiss. \n“We were going to have the drag queens come out and then she walks up and we’re like, ‘Lose the drag queens. Mariah Carey’s here,” Connolly recalled. “She walked out and was like, ‘Oh, it’s live already? OK, fine.’ And just settled in. It’s fun, I like a little zaniness and she’s unapologetically the best kind of diva in my opinion.” \nThough Carey is welcome to visit the revamped Clubhouse in 2017, she’s not the only mega-star on Connolly and Cohen’s list this year. \n“We’d love to have Michelle Obama when her time opens up,” Connolly said. “I think Andy’s dream guests include Madonna and Beyoncé … Hopefully 2017 is the year these bookings come through.” \n“Watch What Happens Live” airs Sunday through Thursday at 11 p.m. on Bravo.
