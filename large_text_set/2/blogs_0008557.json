King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 9 hours ago 7 \nAs reported, glam metallers Nitro are making a comeback with original guitarist Michael Angelo Batio and vocalist Jim Gillette, along with Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler.During a recent appearance on the Talking Metal Podcast , Batio revealed that the lineup was actually completed with a renowned Grammy Award-winning bassist whose identity still cannot be unveiled.Additionally, the guitarist said the band is planning to release one to three songs sometime in March.But perhaps the biggest surprise is that the guys have apparently ditched their glam metal roots and went for more of a death-metal approach, going so far that they hired Lamb of God producer Josh Wilbur, who worked with the band on three of their latest full-length albums - 2009's \" Wrath ,\" 2012's \" Resolution ,\" and 2015's \" VII: Sturm und Drang .\"Batio stated: \"Jim has a great death metal voice that he didn't have back then and he's going to be singing. There is going to be singing and there's going to be super-heavy death sounds.\"To categorize what we are doing - think part Lamb of God and a very small part that nods to the past [of Nitro] only because Jim is singing first and the music is super, super aggressive. I am using all seven strings on the guitar. It's mean. It's really mean.\"Discussing how the boys got Mr. Adler into the fold in the first place, Michael explained: \"Neither one of us actually knew him. We were at my house, recording demos and writing songs, I had this really good drums and I'm a really good drum programmer. I'm doing these advanced-level drums and Jim goes to me, 'Who do you think we should get for drums?'\"We're shaking out heads and he goes, 'Chris Adler.' And I'm thinking, 'Lamb of God's drummer?' Neither one of us ever met him, but, I've worked with a publicist named Suzanne Penley; her significant other, Dave Vincent from Morbid Angel, he's a super-close friend of mine, and she works with Chris.\"So I called Suzanne and I told her we're interested in getting Chris for the album, and it turned out Chris is a fan of mine! And so the whole thing just worked itself out and Chris is in the band now. He's not leaving Lamb of God. Jim and I can both do things while he's away with Lamb of God, but he's a member of Nitro now. He's absolutely fantastic, my favorite metal drummer. There's not many people when you listen to drums you know who it is - and he's one of those. He's got a very distinct style and he can play anything.\"Batio added: \"He's super busy. One of the bonuses that came with Chris is that he's worked with producer Josh Wilbur for the last 10 years, since ' Redneck .' He brought Josh onboard, he's the producer of the new [Nitro] album, and man is it sounding great!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:59:50.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
