These displays are becoming a bigger and more elaborate each year in MLS as part of the growing soccer culture in America.

That kind of ‘success’ though, is impossible to predict. We really don’t feel any pressure that we have to design something that can match that kind of impact.” \nThe fan group said it typically takes a team of 10 to 20 people a week to create a tifo. Saturday’s display wa created over a weekend, the group said. The effort is a collaborative art project, spearheaded by a group of three or four people who refused to be identified. \n“We don’t make tifo for recognition or status,” Centennial 38 said in a statement. “We make tifo to support the team. It’s bigger than any individual, and that’s why we prefer a degree of anonymity and prefer being referred to as a group.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T01:45:48.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
