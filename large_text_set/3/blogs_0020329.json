Hours later, her family found a devastating clue to her disappearance: a Facebook Live video in which the high school freshman was allegedly sexually assaulted by several men.\nAfter seeing the video, the girl’s family alerted police, who began an extensive search for the girl. She was found crying on a neighbor’s porch on Tuesday. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment and then released to her mother. (PEOPLE is not identifying the alleged victim or her family.)\nChicago Police confirm to PEOPLE that they believe the girl knew at least one of her “five or six” alleged attackers. Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says that the investigation is progressing, but no formal suspects have yet been announced.\nUPDATE: CPD making good progress identifying persons of interest in 10th Dist assault.

Although authorities acknowledge that the video had about 40 people watching it at one point, it’s unclear who, exactly, was viewing. “We are not releasing that information at this time,” a police spokesperson tells PEOPLE.\nNOVA SAFO/AFP/Getty This is not the first time that Chicago has been rocked by a disturbing social media video. In January, four people were arrested for the alleged torture of a bound and gagged special-needs man. That attack was also streamed live on Facebook.\nFor authorities, these attacks highlight a problem of the way that people interact on social media.\n“What’s even more disturbing, more than the fact that they did this, there were so many people that saw this and they didn’t pick up the phone and dial 911,” police Superintendent Eddie Johnson tells WGN-TV . “That’s just not right.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:00:53.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
