The surprise new buildout drops on Main Street in early April, less than two blocks from the existing 4th Street Market .\nThe newcomer is the work of Leonard Chan and partner Phillip Kwan. Chan is the Orange County guy behind everything from The Iron Press and California Shabu-Shabu to various spots at places inside the Anaheim Packing District and beyond. Now they’re tackling the boom-or-bust Santa Ana market, which is already rife with concepts like coffee house Hopper & Burr and dinner destinations Playground and Irenia .\nMcFadden Public Market will take a decidedly late night tone, with an on-site barcade called Mission Control that will serve drinks alongside the video games . You’ll otherwise be able to dine at four other concepts within, including one called Rooster Republic that does fried chicken and another called Bone Stock that offers a modern take on Vietnamese food. There’s Tacos en tu Boca for a cross-cultural take on tacos, and Milk Man for ice cream. Elsewhere on the drinks side will be Under Control, a craft cocktail bar and lounge for live music.\nMcFadden Public Market officially comes online April 3, but will start operating in a soft open sort of way beginning March 31. Show up that first night and you’ll get 25% off anything you eat or drink, plus free play on the games. After that, expect daily hours from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., plus longer for the bars.\nMcFadden Public Market \n515 N.
