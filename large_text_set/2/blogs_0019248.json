Following the news that she would be launching an accessories range with the Bugatti Group, the undeniable icon just unveiled select pieces from the Celine Dion Collection at a press conference in Las Vegas. \nAccording to Women's Wear Daily , Celine reportedly displayed about 70 pieces from her collection at a trade show on Feb. 21. Her entire collection, however, will feature a whopping 200 pieces including backpacks, clutches, wallets, and even tech accessories. As a sentimental addition, Celine designed each bag to have the visual representation of her voice's unique sound wave on the interior. This same visual was repeated in the floor design at her event. \nLaw Roach, Celine's stylist and a judge on the current season of America's Next Top Model , was also in attendance. In a particularly candid moment, Celine thanked him for transforming her style in the best way she knows how: through song . . . while wearing an amazing ensemble from the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring 2017 collection, no less. \nItems from the Celine Dion Collection — which range from $78 to $1,998 — won't be officially available until September, however, four pieces will be available on her website on a pre-sale basis starting Feb. 27. Those pre-sale items are meant to represent four mini collections within her entire range: the Cavatina, Vibrato, Octave and Pizzicate collections. \nAhead, check out pictures of those items, as well as snaps from the exciting launch event.
