In fact, it doesn't look like it's any closer to happening now than it was this time last year, but one very important person who remains keen on the idea is Avengers: Infinity War star and Hawkeye actor Jeremy Renner.\nAsked in a recent interview for his thoughts on the possibility of a movie which would star both the archer and Scarlett Johannson's Natasha Romanoff, he replied: \"I always thought it would make sense early on to do a Hawkeye/Widow movie because they’re quite similar. They don’t have powers, have high skill sets and have history together. But I don’t think there are any discussions about that happening. I’d love to do it though.\" So, that's not exactly the most optimistic of updates then!\nHowever, with a jam packed Phase 3 slate, it's hard to see where a Black Widow movie could fit. It would certainly make sense for Clint Barton to show up, but rather than it being a full on team-up, flashbacks depicting how the two met would arguably be a lot more interesting.
