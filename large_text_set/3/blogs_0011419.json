A toad was paying him a visit every night at his home in Alabama, he explains on Imgur . \nHe thinks it was a Fowler’s Toad or American Toad, and got the idea that the amphibian might need a hat. Chris called him Mr. Toad, although he admits the “he” could have been a “she”. \nHe decided to make hats for the toad and send the pictures to a friend’s little boy, who had lost his frog. He sent the boy the hats afterwards, so that he’d have some hats for when he found a new toad. \nEach hat creation took around 10 minutes, but there was a flare to the designs that Mr. Toad seemed to appreciate. \nNote: photos below may take a few seconds to toad…we mean load. \n“The toad that hangs out on my porch needed a hat,” writes Chris. \n“I decided to enter the world of toad millinery and help the little guy out. Foam paper seemed like a toad friendly material.” \n“Here’s Mr Toad getting a hat.” \n“Perfect fit! He looked dapper, but still needed something…” \n“Turn that hat into a toad pimp hat.” \n“Add a monocle for a dapper pimp look.” \n“How do you do, fellow kids?” \n“Better lighting with the flash. He didn’t mind.” \n“Howdy Tex!” \n“My dog Daisy for scale.” \nFortunately, Chris says that Daisy the dog never pays the toads any attention. \nShare this whimsical toad adventure with your family and friends.
