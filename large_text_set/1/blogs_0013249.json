Yet, this summer, Lionsgate is hoping to land a box office smash with a new, gritty take on the Saban’s superhero franchise. \nAs previously reported, Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks both threw their weight behind the project, cast as Zordon and Rita Repulsa, respectively. Cranston has likened the film to Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight , saying, “This is different. This is as different a reimagining as the [1960s’] Batman television series as it became the [ Dark Knight ] movie series.’ You can’t compare those two, and nor can you compare this movie version of the Power Rangers to that television series. It’s unrecognizable for the most part. There are tenets of the folklore that you hold onto for sure, but the inspiration is different, and the sensibility of it, and the approach to the film making is completely different.” \nWhile a teaser premiered at Comic-Con offered our first glimpse at the movie, today’s trailer provides the first look at the Power Rangers in action along with Cranston’s Zordon. While I’m not yet ready to agree with Cranston’s Dark Knight comparison, it does look more geared to adults than Fox’s previous stab at a feature film, 1995’s less than stellar Mighty Morphin Power Rangers . Plus, the trailer is soundtracked by Kanye West’s “Power”. Check it out above. \nDirected by Dean Israelite and also starring Dacre Montgomery , RJ Cyler , Naomi Scott , Becky G , and Ludi Lin , Saban’s Power Rangers hits theaters March 24th, 2017.
