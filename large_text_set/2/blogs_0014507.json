Weezy also brought out Mannie Fresh, 2 Chainz, DJ Khaled, Fat Joe, Remy Ma and more. \nWith the NBA All-Star Weekend taking place in Lil Wayne ‘s hometown of New Orleans, the rap icon made the most of the occasion to make the BeatsXNOLA hosted by LeBron James on Saturday a once-in-a-lifetime kind of event. \nDuring Wayne’s performance, he reunited with two of his three Hot Boys bandmates and brought out Mannie Fresh , 2 Chainz , DJ Khaled , Fat Joe and Remy Ma during his set. \n“We got Tunechi, Juvie, Mannie and Turk in here tonight in their backyard in New Orleans,” James said during an introduction. “I grew up on these boys right here…. I had to let y’all know that everything that goes on tonight, you better appreciate the shit, because it may not happen again.” \nHot Boys formed in 1997 and helped launch the careers of members Lil Wayne, Juvenile , Turk and B.G. They split up in 2001 due to issues with their record label Cash Money. Legal troubles followed for members Turk and B.G., in particular. Turk spent 2006–2012 on first-degree attempted murder charges and in 2012 B.G. was sentenced to 14 years in a federal prison for gun possession and witness tampering. As such, B.G. was absent from Saturday’s reunion. The Hot Boys (without B.G.) notably performed with Mannie Fresh during Lil Wayne’s Lil WeezyAna Fest in August 2015. \nWatch video footage of the night shot by XXL and others here: TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:16:59.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
