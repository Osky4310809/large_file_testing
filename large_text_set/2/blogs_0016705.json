Knowing these vital organs remove waste and toxins from your system, stimulate the production of red blood cells and regulate your blood pressure, you know you need to do something fast. \nIt's very likely that one of the first things your doctor will do is put you on a regimen of medications. \nBut a new, five-year study just emerged revealing that one of the best things you can do for your kidneys is to eat three or four servings of vegetables and fruits daily. Not only can they help you regain your health but also may help save you money on medical costs, including medication. \nIn fact, eating healthy fruits and vegetables could help cut your drug costs by as much as 50 percent. Eating the Right Foods Improves Your Kidney Function \nYou might be wondering how that works. According to the study at the University of Texas, it starts with a shift in nutrition. \nCertain foods help you manage your blood pressure better than others and, at the same time, improve several other aspects of your health, potentially initiating healthier readings in things like systolic blood pressure . \nThe five-year study showed that a positive change in diet lowered the systolic blood pressure of subjects with kidney disease better than those who opted for medication. \nU.S. News reported that the study tracked a small number of participants with kidney concerns so researchers could compare standard medical treatment outcomes with nutritional intervention. \nThe goal of the scientists was to determine who did better — the people in the drug group or those in the food group. The two gauges were not only which did better at naturally decreasing blood pressure but also whether or not using food to do it could make any difference in costs. \nYou already know the outcome. Healthy food prevailed, hands down. Study participants showed improvement the first year, and drug costs lowered every year thereafter, saving an average total of $153,000 for the veggie group over the span of the five-year study. 1 \nDr. Nimrit Goraya, study author and program director for nephrology at Baylor Scott & White Healthcare in Temple, Texas, said that for people with kidney disease — or those wanting to prevent it — the importance of eating the right foods rather than settling for medications was \"huge.\" Other studies show that taking blood pressure drugs may increase your risk of death . Vegetables and Exercise — Stunning Findings for Blood Pressure \nA 28-study review at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, involving more than 1,000 patients on kidney dialysis, resulted in more very promising statistics. Scientists found that those who regularly employed both aerobic and resistance (strength) training exercises lowered their blood pressure readings significantly. 2 \nLona Sandon, clinical nutrition program director at the School of Health Professions at UT Southwestern in Dallas, noted that three or four servings of veggies and fruits, depending on the type, make all the difference: \n\"It is remarkable what fruits and vegetables can do, along with a little exercise. Blood pressure meds come with many side effects that may leave people feeling sluggish, or other problems. \nThe side effects of fruits and vegetables and exercise is better health. When people have access to healthy foods, they can change their health. And especially when they eat the recommended amounts that were provided to them in the study. \" 3 High Blood Pressure: the Second-Highest Cause of Kidney Failure \nA few years ago, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that high blood pressure fatalities were on the rise . \nMany people don't realize that the kidneys and circulatory systems work together to prevent high blood pressure (HBP), aka hypertension. As the American Heart Association 4 reveals, kidney damage from high blood pressure occurs three ways: First, HBP causes artery damage. The dense blood vessels and arteries in kidneys mean that high amounts of blood flow through them, but because this disease weakens them, adequate blood can't be delivered to kidney tissue. Blood doesn't filter properly through damaged kidneys. Miniscule, finger-like nephrons filtering your blood get their supply through even smaller, hair-like capillaries, but with kidney damage, they don't get the oxygen or nutrients they require. Hormones, acids, salts and other fluids in your body are left unregulated. Blood pressure is also unregulated and doesn't produce an important hormone for it to self-regulate, beginning a downward spiral. More arteries become blocked and stop functioning, causing kidney failure. \nThis all sounds pretty grim, but the important thing to remember is that this usually happens gradually over several years — and it can be prevented. \nIn the U.S. every third person aged 65 and older has chronic kidney disease, or CKD. Most don't progress toward advanced stages because they succumb to end-stage renal disease first, even if they have stage 4 CKD, a 2014 study in the journal Clinical Practice reveals. 5 \nAn Italian study found that consuming just 7 grams a day of protein led to a reduction in kidney failure. Perhaps more importantly, an argument was made that a low-protein diet is far preferable to one containing excessive protein. 6 That said, you may need to restrict your protein intake . \nAbout one-half gram of protein per pound of lean body mass is all you need. Fructose should only be eaten in small amounts — about 25 grams or 6 teaspoons — per day (in spite of the fact that the American Kidney Fund allows for as much as 40 to 50 grams). DaVita, a kidney education website, notes: \n\"Researchers are discovering more and more links between chronic diseases inflammation and \"super foods\" that may prevent or protect against undesirable fatty acid oxidation, a condition that occurs when the oxygen in your body reacts with fats in your blood and your cells. \nOxidation is a normal process for energy production and many chemical reactions in the body, but excessive oxidation of fats and cholesterol creates molecules known as free radicals that can damage your proteins, cell membranes and genes.\" 7 \nBesides kidney disease, some of the diseases studies have associated with free radical damage include cancer, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and other recurring and degenerative conditions. But foods containing antioxidants can help neutralize and protect your body from free radical damage. \nFoods containing phosphorous tend to promote kidney stone formation . Foods with high amounts of potassium, such as vegetables and seeds, are good choices, in moderation. Unfortunately, only 2 percent of people in the U.S. get adequate amounts of potassium, often because the others eat too many processed foods. \nThe top 15 fruits, veggies and other foods 8 , 9 containing potent antioxidants for a healthy balance between sodium, potassium and phosphorus include: \n✓ Red bell peppers \n✓ Asparagus , string beans and celery \n✓ Garlic and onions", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:43:34.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
