Our security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing he will be caught in a short period of time.\" \nHe said that of 21 victims who had been identified so far, 16 were foreigners and five were Turks. Another 69 people were being treated in hospital for their wounds. \nIt is not known if any Britons were among the casualties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T11:44:11.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
