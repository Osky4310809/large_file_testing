Instead of going to an arbitration hearing, they’ll simply pay Donaldson a 2017 salary of $17 million. \nThat will change in a big way a year from now, when Donaldson’s poised to shatter league-wide arbitration records in his final year of eligibility. In the meantime, the Blue Jays have just four cases to resolve, three of which are relatively minor. \nTeams and players have until Friday to exchange figures, which makes this week a busy one for negotiations and agreements alike. Conversations with three people actively involved in ongoing arbitration cases around baseball provide a closer look at the Blue Jays’ four arbitration-eligible players… \nDARWIN BARNEY Under team control through: 2017 MLB Trade Rumors 2017 salary projection: $1.6 million \nBarney signed his most recent contract in free agency, which complicates his case. Making matters more difficult, there aren't many great comps out there. At this point one informed observer considers the MLBTR projection light. \nAARON LOUP Under team control through: 2018 MLB Trade Rumors 2017 salary projection: $1.2 million \nThe combination of an early-season injury and struggles at the MLB level will limit Loup to a minimal raise. \nEZEQUIEL CARRERA Under team control through: 2019 MLB Trade Rumors 2017 salary projection: $1.2 million \nCarrera will get a nice raise, but he'll still be making modest money in 2017. Unfortunately for the 29-year-old, post-season production doesn't drive arbitration salaries; he hit .303 with an .858 OPS during the 2016 playoffs. \nMARCUS STROMAN Under team control through: 2020 MLB Trade Rumors 2017 salary projection: $3.5 million \nStroman will earn a big raise in his first time through the arbitration process, setting up future increases in each of the next three off-seasons. \nThe right-hander pitched more than 200 innings in 2016, and has significant playoff experience, including a strong start in last year’s Wild Card game. If the sides were to go to a hearing, Stroman could tell a compelling story of overcoming injury and delivering in big spots. \nOn the other hand, missing most of the 2015 season limits his career innings, and his platform ERA was a pedestrian 4.37. \n“That missing year and mediocre platform do him no favours,” said one experienced arbitration specialist. \nNathan Eovaldi ($3.3 million for 2015) and Garrett Richards ($3.2 million for 2015) look like prime comps for Stroman, though both are from a couple of winters ago. Eovaldi posted an identical 4.37 ERA in 199.2 innings during his platform year on his way to a $3.3-million salary. \n“Stroman is a better pitcher and has the post-season experience, but Eovaldi has more career bulk, and I think they ultimately balance out,” a second arbitration expert said. \nWhen Marlins starter Tom Koehler obtained $3.5 million this time last year, he had 173.1 more career innings than Stroman plus a comparable platform year. There’s no way for Stroman to overcome that innings gap, but he should gain points for pitching big games for a playoff team. Plus, he has a lifetime 24-16 record and even though the arbitration process has gradually adopted some modern stats, wins still get starters paid. %2Fbaseball%2Fmlb%2Fblue-jays-arbitration-primer-stroman-poised-first-big-raise%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T19:50:17.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
