It’s set to go into effect at 7 p.m. Monday night and last until 2 p.m. Tuesday. \nIf affects Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Howard County, Harford County, Carroll County, Frederick County, Montgomery County, D.C. and more counties in western Maryland. \nCounties further to the east and south, like Prince George’s and Anne Arundel, are under a Winter Weather Advisory that expires at noon Tuesday. \nFor areas affected by the winter storm warning, “We are expecting now roughly eight to twelve inches of snow,” says Meteorologist Chelsea Ingram . Other regions could potentially see four to six inches. \n“This is the last gasp of winter, and probably the biggest one we’ve seen,” she says. “Between about 8 p.m. and midnight, that’s when we expect to see that snow to really start going. Between about midnight and 8 a.m. [Tuesday], that when we could actually see some periods of heavy snow. Maybe even one to two inches per hour coming down.” \n\nThere are two systems that meteorologists are watching, with one area of high pressure to the south of Maryland and another of low pressure coming from the west. \nThe NWS says snow may make many roads in the area impassable and produce power outages. \n\nThere will likely be a very sharp division between snow and a mix of rain and snow by Tuesday. Even going through Tuesday afternoon we’ll be seeing the snow showers at varying levels of intensity moving on through. \nThe Maryland Emergency Management Agency offers the following tips for the public during the storm: Closely monitor updated weather forecasts and keep electronic communications devices charged. Be cautious shoveling snow or ice to avoid overexertion. Take frequent breaks and keep hydrated. If you must travel, make sure to have car chargers, kitty litter or sand for traction. Let friends or family know of your travel route and expected arrival time. If it is safe to do so, consider clearing off roofs if significant snow has accumulated.
