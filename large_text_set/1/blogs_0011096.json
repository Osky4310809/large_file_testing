Bob Arum for a fight with Pacquiao. \n“I have been speaking with Bob Arum about a Kell Brook versus Manny Pacquiao fight,\" Hearn recently told Sky Sports. \nBrook (36-1, 25 KOs) is the reigning IBF welterweight champion who tried his luck at middleweight but got knocked out by Gennady Golovkin in September last year. \nPacquiao could face Brook in the United Kingdom sometime this year as part of Arum’s plan to launch a world tour for the Filipino icon . \nBut first, Pacquiao must deal with Australian Jeff Horn on April 23 at a still to be determined venue. Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nHearn, for his part, said Brook is willing to wait for Pacquiao, who, if he retains his WBO welterweight crown against Horn, could unify titles with the British star. \n\"We are ready to go with that right now, but I think they like the idea of fighting Horn first, so we will now try and work for an Autumn fight,” he added.
