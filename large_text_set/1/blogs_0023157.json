With Trump’s backing and the potential support of some vulnerable Democrats from red states, abortion opponents are optimistic.\n“We are certainly going to be encouraging the Senate to vote,” said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. “We know there would be overwhelming support among the American people for it.”\nThe bill, which was introduced by Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) with companion legislation introduced by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), would put into law a prohibition against the use of federal funds for abortion, which lawmakers already routinely insert into larger pieces of legislation. It would also ban the District from using locally raised tax dollars to provide abortion services to poor women.\n1 of 18 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Photos from the scene of the March for Life rally in Washington View Photos The 44th annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C.

Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not publicly said whether he will bring the bill to the floor for a vote. His office declined to comment as Senate Republicans gathered in Philadelphia for their retreat.\nBut Politico on Wednesday reported on a behind-closed-doors exchange in which McConnell said the bill could not pass the Senate because Democrats have enough votes to block it. His office declined to confirm the exchange.\n“Unlike the House, there’s not a lot of will to have these fights in the Senate,” said Jennifer Duffy, an expert on the Senate at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “Sure, there are a few members but not the numbers they have in the House.”\nSenate Democrats could filibuster to block a vote on the antiabortion bill. And even if the legislation came up for vote, passage would be difficult. To meet the 60-vote threshold, Republicans would need to deliver all their members — already a tall order — and gain eight Democratic defectors.\n“Right now, unfortunately, the majority of Democratic senators are linked at the hip with Planned Parenthood,” Tobias said. “When the abortion lobby says, ‘Jump,’ these Democratic senators say, ‘How high?’ I don’t have a lot of respect for them because I don’t believe they are showing a lot of independence.”\nAbortion opponents would have to rely on Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III (W. Va.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), who all face reelection in 2018 in states that voted for Trump. They also all opposed changing the Democratic Party’s platform to call for the repeal of the Hyde amendment, which bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortion except to save the life of the woman or in cases of incest or rape.\n“Keeping taxpayers out of the abortion business should be a bipartisan issue and we hope that Senate Democrats will support this reasonable and popular principle,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, said in a statement.\nCasey, the antiabortion son of a former Pennsylvania governor with similar views, supports the Hyde amendment and has introduced legislation to codify it into law in the past. His spokesman, John Rizzo, said he would review the bill if it came to the Senate.\nAlthough Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) supports the Hyde amendment, he opposes Smith’s bill because it restricts District funds and prevents women from purchasing insurance coverage for abortion services through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\nThe Trump administration “strongly supports” the bill, according to a policy statement issued by the White House on Tuesday.\n[ Trump reverses abortion-related U.S. policy, bans funding to international health groups ]\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order reinstating a rule that prevents U.S. aid from going to foreign organizations that perform abortions.", "external_links": ["http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/senate-house-filibuster-mcconnell-234192", "https://twitter.com/@jennaportnoy"], "published": "2017-01-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:46:20.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
