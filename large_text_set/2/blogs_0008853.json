Ahead of the official unveiling, an alleged live image of the upcoming Micromax smartphone featuring a dual rear camera setup has hit the interwebs. In addition, most of the other specifications of the device have also been tipped. \nAs seen in the live image, the new Micromax smartphone will feature a metal unibody design. It will have two cameras at the rear in a vertical position with a dual-LED flash sitting in the middle. The device will get a physical home button, which will hide a fingerprint sensor beneath. The source suggests that it will offer a 13MP camera on the back, accompanied by another 5MP sensor. The selfie shooter on board will be a 5MP sensor, which also seems to be accompanied by an LED flash. \nAs for the other specs, the new Micromax offering will reportedly offer a 5.5-inch full HD display with a 2.5D glass on top. It’s likely to be powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6750T processor, mated to 3GB of RAM and Mali T860 graphics. Other expected specs include 32GB storage, Android Nougat, 4G and VoLTE. \nThere’s no word when Micromax is planning to launch the phone at the moment… if it’s indeed the real deal that is. The device is expected to be priced below Rs 15,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:18:14.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
