Among the measures that have benefited the species were a redesign of locks and levees, setting up manatee sanctuaries and speed limits on boats to avoid collisions, the department said in a statement.\n‘We consider this a success story,s Phil Kloer, a spokesman for the department’s Fish and Wildlife Service, said by telephone. ‘It has been doing very well, it has been coming back.’\nDespite the new classification, federal protections for the species will remain in place, the department said.\nDon’t be coy now (Picture: Getty) But Frank Jackalone, director of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, criticized the decision, saying that local and state authorities likely will ease boating rules designed to protect manatees.\n‘Florida boaters are going to take this as a signal that they can increase their speed in manatee’ zones, he said by telephone.\nFlorida state numbers show 520 manatees deaths last year, 104 of them from watercraft.\nJackalone said that the Interior Department decision also failed to address the impact of the closing of ageing Florida power plants whose warm water outflows manatees depend on during cold winter months.\nUnder the ‘threatened’ classification, manatees are considered likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.\nAn ‘endangered’ listing means that a species is in danger of extinction.\nPeek a boo Picture: Rex) The reclassification follows years of lawsuits against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by the Pacific Legal Foundation.\nThe group sued to have the manatee downlisted on behalf of Florida’s Save Crystal River Inc, a nonprofit that feared more federal regulations in the area, Christina Martin, a Pacific Legal lawyer, said by telephone.\nThe manatee, also known as the sea cow due to its diet of sea grass, can weigh more than 3,000 pounds (1,350 kg).\nIts total population has rebounded to more than 13,000, the Interior Department said.\nHere are some lovely picture of sea cows to celebrate: \n(Picture: Rex) (Picture: Getty) (Picture: Getty) (Picture: Getty) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T10:28:59.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
