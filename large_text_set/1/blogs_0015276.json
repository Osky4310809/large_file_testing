We added another dynamic but lost focus for only five minutes. \n\"You have to accept the result. We know something could happen but we'll use this as motivation for the next game. We knew it was logical that one day the unbeaten run would come to an end. \n\"I always said that the season until the end is tough. We were unfortunate with the own goal. But this can happen in football. I am very proud of my players. \n\"Sevilla have shown that they are contenders for La Liga. We will continue with the same work as we've done until now. We'll analyse the game and see what needs to improve. \n\"I'm happy with the game but disappointed with our two mistakes. We aren't going to change anything. It's difficult to digest a loss but you have to relax and think about Wednesday [against Celta Vigo in the Copa del Rey] with a clear head. \n\"Sevilla played very well. They were intense in everything they did. Obviously we're hurt. A defeat is never welcome here.\" \nZidane also paid tribute to Ramos, who was the target for abuse from Sevilla fans in Thursday's 3-3 Copa draw, responding by cupping his hands to his ears in celebration after converting a 'Panenka' penalty. \n\"I'm very proud of our captain, he played a great game,\" Zidane said. \"Own goals happen in football. He showed great personality.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T01:28:29.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
