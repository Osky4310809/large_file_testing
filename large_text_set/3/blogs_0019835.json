It’s a chilling reminder of the fact that while the concept for the show might seem neat and entertaining, there are some very stark parallels between our world and that horrifying dystopia.\nSpeaking of dystopias, over on Movies.com , Erik Davis shares a defense of why The Terminator deserves to stick around. It’s a response to the rumor that the forthcoming newest installment of the franchise was reportedly cancelled. According to Collider , Mission: Impossible 6 features a stunt for which Tom Cruise has trained for well over a year. I’m a fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise simply for its showy over-the-top setpieces and stories, so you know I’m interested. \nOne of the more striking elements of the John Wick movies is the novel way in which they shoot the gunfighting sequences (i.e., you can actually see what’s going on). This parody of John Wick featuring only Nerf guns feels really true-to-form. Those sounds, though! Hilarious . Kudos, Corridor. (via Pajiba )\nAll it took was a variant cover of Gwen Stacy as Deadpool to bring us Gwenpool . So, Marvel seems to be testing the waters a bit again as they’ve put Mary Jane Watson into some other iconic Marvel roles: The Punisher, Iron Fist, and, of course, Deadpool.

Just watch it.\nWhat’d you see today, dear pal-o-mine-oh?\n(featured image via Hulu)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
