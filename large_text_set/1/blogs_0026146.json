Now the Queen is put in a very difficult position.\" The Queen now finds herself in a \"very difficult position\" it is claimed (Photo: AFP) \nMay is under growing pressure to say whether she was briefed by Trump's aides on his controversial travel ban when the pair met for the first time last week. \nShe is facing calls from MPs to say what she was told by American officials about the temporary ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries issued hours after her meeting with the president in the White House on Friday. \nDowning Street refused to be drawn on a report by Channel 4 News that she had been told refugees would be barred from travelling to the US, although officials were said not to have revealed much detail. \n\"You will have heard the Prime Minister and the president's comments following their discussions and we are not going to go into details of a private meeting,\" a No 10 spokesman said.

Parliament needs to know what she knew and when.\" \nDespite growing protests at the planned state visit, May - in Dublin on Monday for talks with Irish prime minister Enda Kenny - was adamant it would go ahead. \nIn the Commons, Johnson told MPs the Government had been given assurances the ban would not affect British passport holders. \nForeign Office sources suggested the UK had secured a \"special carve-out\" from Trump's policy after a round of frantic diplomatic activity, with Johnson and Home Secretary Amber Rudd contacting their counterparts. \nThe US embassy had earlier suggested that UK citizens with dual nationality including one of the seven countries covered by the temporary travel ban - Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - should not seek to obtain a visa. \nThe guidance was subsequently removed from the embassy website.
