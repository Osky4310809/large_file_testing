Our reporters answer the question that plagued both England legends' careers Now that they're both retired from football, we can start the debate all over again! Share Frank Lampard has joined Steven Gerrard in retirement after a storied career (Photo: The FA via Getty) Share Get football   Thank you for subscribing!   \nIt is the debate that's raged throughout both of their brilliant careers. Two players at the very centre of the golden age of both the Premier League and the England team. \nThat Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard never played together for club and couldn't quite click for country only served to make this argument all the more fiery. \nTwo such shining talents - at the heights of their powers at the same time - will always invite fierce comparisons. But then, isn't that half the fun of sport? \nSo, we asked our reporters one of the ultimate questions of the Premier League era after Lampard announced that he had joined his former international team-mate in retirement: Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard \nAnd it's fair to say it was a tough call... The pair were plagued by comparisons throughout their playing days (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Read More Mike Walters \nGerrard for me every time. \nNothing against Lampard - because I saw his first goal in senior football, for West Ham at Barnsley on the opening day of the season in 1997. At 19, he tucked away the winner with the maturity of a veteran, and purely as a goalscoring midfielder in the modern era he is incomparable. \nBut when everyone else was having a stinker, did he turn games through his passing range, spectacular goals and sheer force of his personality, like Gerrard in the 2006 FA Cup final? \nHow many times did Lampard haul England up by their bootstraps when their tempo was moribund? \nOne game stands out for me: Andorra away, March 2007, when travelling England fans turned on manager Steve McClaren (and, bizarrely, injured players sitting in the stand, including Lampard). Lampard vs Gerrard: Premier League head-to-head 10 Draws Read More Jamie Carragher finally admits his respect for Frank Lampard after Chelsea legend hangs up his boots Gerrard's proudest moment was winning the 2005 Champions League (Photo: null) \nAfter a dreadful, goalless first half it was Gerrard who escaped the brutal marking and rose above the physical provocation to score twice as England went on to win 3-0. \nAn enduring regret is that Harry Redknapp did not get the England job because, better late than never, he would have found a way to get the best out of Lampard and Gerrard in the same team, a trick which escaped Sven Goran Eriksson, McClaren and Fabio Capello. \nJames Corden got it right in that Comic Relief sketch when his character Smithy, from Gavin & Stacey, stumbled into the England team room at the Grove hotel and, turning to Lampard, said: \"You are really, really good at football, and he (Gerrard) is just as good, if not a teensy bit better.\" Neil Moxley Lampard won 11 major honours in a trophy-laden spell with Chelsea (Photo: Getty) \nLampard - not by much - but for a start he weighed in with more goals. \nThe ex-Chelsea man did not win matches through the sheer force of will as Gerrard did but his return from midfield is staggering. \nHe also fitted well into a team pattern - as evidenced by the Premier League crowns he won. \nWould Gerrard have thrived under Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge? \nProbably, but he would have had to have to fit into a more rigid shape. I always got the impression it was him plus ten at Anfield. Read More John Cross \nBoth. \nThey were both world class players. It's a poor reflection on England tactically that the national team never released their true potential that they showed week in and week out for their clubs. Lampard vs Gerrard: Premier League head-to-head 913 England Caps Simon Mullock \nThis question is as difficult to answer as brown sauce or ketchup on your bacon sandwich. \nLampard's numbers are better in terms of games played and goals scored - and his knack of avoiding injury during an era where players got so much faster and stronger was incredible. \nIf we are talking about consistency then Lampard wins it.

I don't think I have seen another central midfielder in the Premier League with the ability to change a game like Gerrard. \nHe didn't just score goals - he scored heavy goals. There were times when Liverpool were virtually a one-man team. It was an honour to be in Istanbul 2005 and Cardiff 2006. \nSo I'm leaving the condiments alone. Lampard or Gerrard? I'll go with Paul Scholes. Lampard and Gerrard often featured alongside one another for the Three Lions (Photo: GETTY) Richard Innes \nIn many respects, they were remarkably similar players: energetic, classy, athletic central midfielders who regularly scored vital goals for club and country. \nThat's why it's virtually impossible to pick one over the other if you look at the pair of them in isolation, assessing them purely on the basis of their individual abilities. For me, the difference only becomes clear when you look at what they did for the players around them, as the fulcrum of their respective teams. \nLampard always gave the impression of a man thriving in a positive environment; of a player elevated towards brilliance by a happy, very timely change in circumstances at Chelsea. \nGerrard, on the other hand, often seemed hindered by the hand he was dealt. Inextricably tied to the club that he couldn't leave, he had to drag Liverpool towards the level at which he belonged. \nWhile Lampard was being pushed, Gerrard was having to pull - and that's why he would be my choice. Steven Gerrard has returned to Liverpool to begin a career as a coach. Could Lampard go to Chelsea in a similar capacity? (Photo: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty) Jack Rathborn \nThis debate will forever be debated but the short answer is Frank Lampard because a team will never simply play a one-off game. \nSteven Gerrard's peak was undoubtedly higher, though his teams often demanded his inspirational moments, whereas Lampard was mostly surrounded by better players. \nThe sheer consistency, health and unprecedented production for a midfielder mean Lampard is the choice. To be able to pencil in 20 goals, at least, and up to 20 assists in all competitions over an extended prime of five-plus years would be an incredible luxury for a manager from any era. \nA player of Gerrard's ilk could separate two elite sides in huge games more often, which is tempting, but his positional discipline was often suspect, whereas Lampard could adjust better to different styles. The pair were joint recipients of the PFA's Merit award in 2015 (Photo: PA) Alex Richards \nThey couldn't live with each other, and apparently they can't live without one another. \nBoth were stupendous midfielders, at the heart of two of England's biggest football clubs as they battled for domestic and continental glory. \nSo how do you choose between them? Certainly it's difficult and an unbiased answer is one that 99 per cent of football supporters seemingly struggle with. For all their club successes, the international era of Lampard and Gerrard was one largely of failure (Photo: Jan Kruger - The FA) \nTo do so in an unbiased fashion is similarly difficult. \nSo I'll leave it as this. \nIf I'm in a 38-game league season, then I'm going Lampard, for consistency and the guarantee of double figure goals and assists year in, year out. \nIn a cup final, then Gerrard, a man who seemed to win matches, on the biggest of stages for his boyhood club, seemingly by sheer force of will. Adam Newson \nAt both their absolute bests Steven Gerrard would probably shave it but, as Jose Mourinho once said, Lampard is a player for all games. \nRain or shine. Summer of winter. Lampard delivered match after match - something his record of 164 consecutive Premier League games for an outfield player is testament to. \nHis goalscoring from midfield was and is unrivalled while his number of assists (202) is often overlooked. There's very little Lampard couldn't do. The pair briefly resumed their rivalry in the MLS (Photo: Paul Webb) \nYes, Gerrard single-handedly dragged Liverpool to wins they didn't deserve and his performance in Istanbul is one of the greatest displays of sheer will to win you're likely to see. \nBut Lampard was just as effective in big matches, just not in the same style. Don't forget he scored an FA Cup final winner and an equaliser in a Champions League final. \nIt's a shame - although Liverpool fans will rightly disagree - that Mourinho never got his wish of uniting the pair at Chelsea in 2005. \nThe two of them in the same team under a tactically competent manager could have been something very special for Chelsea and England. poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:38:42.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
