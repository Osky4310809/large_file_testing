At the end of a 10-day search, Chip Lindsey hit all the marks: develop and evaluate quarterbacks extremely well; comfortable within Malzahn’s system and coaching style; and a play caller with hurry-up, no-huddle roots. The Arizona State offensive coordinator was hired to replace Rhett Lashlee and will call plays and handle the quarterbacks starting now, Malzahn reiterated often during a press conference Saturday. Still, Lindsey wasn’t the only coach Malzahn spoke to about the job. He publicly turned down by Oklahoma State offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich , who interviewed at the beginning of the week, and Noel Mazzone pulled his name out of the hat quickly following a report linking his name to the job. “I had a really open mind, talked to numerous people,” Malzahn said. “I wanted to take my time, by design, and if you look at our defensive coordinator I did the same thing when we hired Kevin Steele last year. Bottom line is I was looking for the best person for this job that would give us the best chance at being successful. Chip Lindsey fit all three.” *** Get free breaking news in the Auburn Undercover newsletter *** Malzahn said he talked to some “very good” and “talented” candidates. “Chip is in a similar situation that I was when I came here (to Auburn) in 2009,” said Malzahn, who was hired at Auburn after three years calling plays at Arkansas and Tulsa. “I think I had three years experience before I came here, he’s actually got one more than me. At the end of the day, there wasn’t an exact time. I just wanted to make sure I have the best guy. When I came to that conclusion, we hired Chip Lindsey .” Malzahn also refuted reports, including at AuburnUndercover, that there was some disagreements within the athletics department about candidates. “We’re all on the same page.” Lindsey will be paid $700,000 per year as part of a three-year contract at Auburn, a source told AuburnUndercover. He is eligible for a bonus at the end of each year he completes on his contract in addition to other performance-based incentives. Those numbers were not immediately made available and a contract has not been released to the media. Lindsey was paid $650,000 per year at Arizona State. “I wanted to talk to as many people as I could to get the right guy,” Malzahn said. “I talked to numerous guys, like I said, and it just came back to Chip. I’ve got a lot of trust. He’s ready for the job.” The job will serve as a reunion for Lindsey, who served as an analyst on Malzahn’s staff at Auburn in 2013. Receivers coach Kodi Burns , then a graduate assistant, running backs coach Tim Horton , special teams coach Scott Fountain and defensive line coach Rodney Garner were on the staff at the time. Lindsey hired Burns at Arizona State, but Burns decided to leave the job for Auburn after only two weeks in January 2016. Players, coaches, fans react to Chip Lindsey as Auburn OC Start SlideShow “He left me pretty quick, didn't he?” Lindsey said. “I'm excited. Kodi was here in ’13 with me and he's a bright young coach. Just looking forward, really, to working with that whole staff. I've worked with all those guys and they're just a great group of guys, great group of young men. Some older than others, I guess. Those guys are men of character, guys you want to be around and you want your kids to play for and I'm looking forward to being around them.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T10:41:35.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
