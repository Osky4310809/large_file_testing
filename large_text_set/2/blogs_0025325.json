Mr Lynn, who was wearing only his boxer shorts, was able to bite a hole in the bag so that he could breath. \nMoments later he heard a thump as the men threw Mrs Howarth into the back of the pickup truck as though she were “a bag of potatoes”. Sue Howarth died in hospital a few days after the attack \nT hey drove around for some time before, before they stopped, pulled Mr Lynn out and marched him through the veld and through a barbed wire fence. \n“He told me to kneel and that's it - I woke up with my arms behind my back and on my left hand side looking horizontally and it was black. It was all black. I couldn't see a thing.” \nHe crawled around 30 metres and then walked towards a road where found his wife, struggling to stay alive. \nSeveral cars and trucks drove by before two men who were towing a fishing boat stopped to help. Mr Lynn was taken to hospital and sedated. Mrs Howarth died on Tuesday morning. \nMrs Howarth was born in Southsea in Portsmouth. She was the daughter of a Royal Navy officer and loved horses and dogs, especially border collies. Mr Lynn said she won his heart when she helped him stand up after he had fallen off a chair at a dart tournament in Johannesburg. I don't know what they achieved. That's what I want to try and find out \nW hat troubles him most about his wife’s murder is that the men appeared to have no real motive other than stealing a small amount of money. “These people… I don't know what kind of goal they have in life. I don't know what they achieved. That's what I want to try and find out. \n“There is nothing here. They killed my wife in a ditch… I don’t know why I survived. Why should I have survived?” Mr Lynn said he doesn’t know he will do next. \nHe is retired, has no children and hasn’t thought about returning to his hometown of Belfast in Northern Ireland. “Sue’s dogs are taken care of. I would like to give everything I own away and disappear for good,” he said. \nThree men, who were arrested in front of a tavern in the town of Belfast late last week, appeared in court on Monday morning in connection with the attack but were not officially charged and so cannot yet be named. \nThey were remanded in custody will appear again on March 10. \nOutside the court more than a hundred farmers gathered to show their support to the couple and to plead for the government to do more to protect farmers. \nDavid Spoor, a farmer in the area, said farm murders have reached an “unprecedented level” in South Africa . \n“Not much was stolen,” he said. “The torture and the beating and the shooting is just totally unnecessary. They could have just tied them up, taken their goods and left. This was torture.” \nAccording to the group Afriforum 345 farmers were murdered in South Africa in 2016. Mrs Howarth was the 15th person living on a farm to be killed in February alone.
