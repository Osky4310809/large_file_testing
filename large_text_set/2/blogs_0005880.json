His fight against the establishment in the 1984 film was inspired by events that happened in Elmore City, Oklahoma , though the film was shot in Utah. Social In Okla City (@SocialNOklaCity) Henryetta Dance Canceled Due To 38-Year-Old City Ordinance https://t.co/uQHMoxPiNm pic.twitter.com/0IcGsPMoS4 February 9, 2017 \nThe Henryetta ordinance dates back to a 1979 ruling, which watered down an earlier ruling that banned all public dancing regardless of location. \nMayor Jennifer Clason, who was born in the town of 6,500 east of Oklahoma City, said she always knew about the old city ordinance but that it has never been enforced. \n“I’d never looked at it because it never came up,” she told KTUL-TV. “It’s an antiquated ordinance, no one has ever looked at it to change it.” \nPolice Chief Steve Norman said his department has no interest in enforcing the rule. \nCity councillors will consider abolishing the ordinance during their meeting on 22 February. \nAssociated Press contributed to this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:34:58.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
