At that time, I was on my menstrual period and had very heavy bleeding. \nMy periods were very heavy for the first three to four days and I would have to wear both pads and tampons at the same time. The bleeding was so bad that I had to change both of them every 2 hours. \nI normally stay at home on the first three days of my period but on this particular day I needed to be at the office to sign some very important paperwork. About thirty minutes before leaving for the day I fainted. My co-workers rushed me to the hospital. While there the doctor told me that I lost a lot of blood and he wanted to give me a blood transfusion. I declined that treatment. I declined the blood transfusion because I didn’t need it since I wasn’t dying. \nI was just anemic from having heavy menstrual periods. The doctor was not pleased with my decision but he didn’t force the issue and I was sent home later that night with some drugs. \nMy struggle with fibroid \nThe reason my periods were so heavy at that time was because of the three fibroid I had in my uterus. I first found out about them back in 2012 and in 2013 I had them removed with surgery. Two years later they came back even bigger. My doctor wanted to schedule another surgery but if it didn’t work the first time why would I go under the knife again for a second time? So I decided to just deal with the pain and heavy bleeding and search for a natural way to get rid of them FOR GOOD! \nSearching for natural ways to get rid of my fibroids was not easy. I saw several advertisements of all kinds of treatments to shrink fibroids. I was a little skeptical but I was desperate to get rid of the fibroids so I tried one in particular which didn’t work. I was still having heavy painful bleeding with lots of clots. I noticed that the soreness in my breast was gone, but after going for another scan, I was told that my fibroids were still there. I was so discouraged that I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to discuss other possibilities for removing the fibroids. \nAbout two months later, while surfing on the internet I saw a post on Facebook talking about how to get rid of fibroid naturally without surgery. I was very skeptical about it. I didn’t even bother to follow the link in the post to read more. Two days later, as I sat alone in the sitting room feeling hopeless about my fibroid, I decided to go on Facebook and see if I can still access the post I saw two days earlier, thank God I was able to get it. I reluctantly gave the Natural product a try …it just made sense. On September17 of 2016, I began the Fibroid Shrinking program as seen on this website here => http://www.newnaijasolution.com/freefib/ \n2016: The Turning Point \nAfter being on this program for about 2 and half months, my period was no longer heavy as before. Usually my periods would last 8 days, with 3 – 4 days being very heavy. I would also spot a lot in between my periods but the spotting stopped, with 2 days of heavy bleeding and my cycle lasting for only 5 days. Once this happened I cancelled my appointment with my doctor and stayed loyal to my program. CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW THE SAME PROGRAM \nThe final result \nLike I said earlier, I had 3 fibroid. One was growing inside my uterus and the other two were inside the walls of my uterus. The largest fibroid was the size of a grapefruit. When I got my results back from a scan I went for, the result shows that I only had one fibroid inside the wall of my uterus and that it was the size of a small apple. So two fibroids completely dissolved away and the largest one was the size of a small apple instead of a grapefruit. Since I wasn’t having any problems with my periods and 2 out of the 3 fibroid were gone, I decided to just continue with the program and go on with my life. \nFibroids completely gone \nTwo months later, I went for another scan and to my surprise and that of my doctor, my fibroid were gone. My doctor kept going over and over the scan result to make sure she was reading it correctly. She couldn’t believe that all of my fibroids were gone without surgery. My uterus was back to its normal size and my periods are now 3 days long. She asked me what I did to make them go away and I told her “ I did what I should have done back in 2013. There are not enough words to explain the happiness I have now. I wish I knew about this program when I first had fibroids but as the saying goes ‘things happen for a reason'”. \nI am so thrilled with my experience that I inspire others to experience for themselves the profound transformation this fibroid treatment program offers. \nI strongly recommend you visit http://www.newnaijasolution.com/freefib/ in case you know someone who has fibroid. It has changed my life and now I’m free!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T12:32:28.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
