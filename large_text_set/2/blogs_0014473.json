I’m truly afraid,” one VA worker who wished to remain anonymous said to WSB-TV. \nThe poster in questions shows Secretary of Defense James Mattis above the phrase “Make Killing Great Again.” It reportedly is hung on a third-story office door. \nThe worker said the poster makes her scared to go into the building. \n“I thought that he would come in there any day and at any time and start shooting the office up,” the staffer said , adding that worker who hung the poster needs to receive a mental health evaluation. \nThe department is aware of the poster and who put it up, according to emails obtained by Diamant. The poster was taken down by Friday afternoon and the department is investigating the matter, according to James Hutton, the acting deputy assistant secretary at the VA. \n“I really feel like if was black or if was from Middle East, they would have took him out of the building in handcuffs,” the anonymous employee went on . \nVeteran Affairs staffers in Florida recently had to deal with a troubling incident. A few workers left a dead veteran’s body in a shower for nine hours and tried to cover up their mistake by falsifying reports.
