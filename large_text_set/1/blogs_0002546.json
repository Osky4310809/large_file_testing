He also advised Nigerians to refrain from making comments that could inflame the crisis in the area. Dambazau said this in   Abuja by his press secretary, Ehisienmen Osaigbovo. The minister said some people were looking for ways to further create division along religious or ethnic fault lines for their selfish interest, with the aim of creating instability in the country. He said that true religious leaders should not fan the embers of hate, but ensure that communities live in peace. The minister noted that economic growth and development would remain a mirage for Nigeria, with over 500 ethnic groups and multiple religions, “unless we resolve to live amicably as a people with a common destiny.” Dambazau said, “Criminals who perpetrate violence against innocent, law-abiding citizens did not discriminate along religious and ethnic lines as could be seen in communities in Zamfara, Katsina, Taraba, Enugu, Lagos and Niger states which were attacked by violent criminals. “A criminal should be treated as such, whether he is involved in armed robbery, drug trafficking, homicide or cattle rustling. People should avoid honouring criminals with religious or ethnic attachment.” He advised opinion and religious leaders to focus on the real enemies of the society, who illegally acquired weapons to terrorise Christian and Muslim communities alike. Dambazau said he had directed the Nigerian Police to ensure the sustenance of law and order, and to arrest and prosecute anyone involved in criminal activities in the area and across the country. Meanwhile, the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, on Tuesday pledged that the federal legislature would probe the crises in Southern Kaduna, which “have led to the wanton loss of lives and property in recent times.” Saraki said this while replying a concerned Nigerian on Twitter on Monday. A twitter user, Chimeze Okoro Ukoha, had tweeted, [email protected] , about 800 Christians massacred in Kaduna and nobody is talking about that. VERY BAD.” In his response, Saraki said, “Once @NGRSenate resumes, this issue will be addressed to get a clearer picture of what the real situation is and find a lasting solution.” Saraki added in another tweet, “Every Nigerian’s life matters and @NGRSenate will work to ensure that rule of law is always upheld as prescribed by the Nigerian constitution.” But, the General Overseer, Omega Fire Ministry Worldwide, Abuja, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has raised the alarm that members of the cabal in the Presidency with a penchant for hatred for Christians were pushing the country to a religious war. According to him, the war between Christians and Muslims “will irreversibly mark the end of Nigeria.” The cleric was reacting to the continuous killing of Christians by alleged Fulani herdsmen in Southern Kaduna and concluded that Nigeria was sliding into fascism and official terrorism. A statement by his Advisor (Public Communications), Mr. Phrank Shaibu, obtained by The PUNCH in Abuja, said Suleman made the remarks during the last edition of the monthly Miracle and Fire Night Service of the church in its international headquarters in Auchi, Edo State. He warned President Muhammadu Buhari and his co-travellers to stop acts of divisiveness, marginalisation, exclusion and palpable hatred for Christians and the body of Christ. “The lack of tolerance currently being witnessed was unprecedented in the history of the country. Anybody who makes the Church and Christians his target for destruction in 2017 will die! God will use them as scapegoats. “A close look at unfolding events reveals that some members of the cabal in the Presidency who are notorious for their hatred for Christians are pushing the country to the precipice and are determined to start a war between Christians and Muslims – a war that will irreversibly mark the end of Nigeria,” Suleman said. According to him, the alleged double standard being adopted by Buhari and the government of the All Progressives Congress in handling the state affairs, especially his silence on the genocide in Southern Kaduna, has continued to fuel mutual recriminations and mistrust among the diverse ethnic and religious groups in the country. While condemning what he referred to as crass abuse of power by the APC in the ongoing genocide in Southern Kaduna, the cleric said he was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that time was “running out on Nigeria because of the way President Buhari is piloting the affairs of the nation.” He said, “The current destruction of churches and about 49,000 houses as well as the mindless onslaught against Christians in Southern Kaduna by Islamic fundamentalists disguising as Fulani herdsmen in a well choreographed acts under the watch of Governor Nasir el-Rufai and President Muhammadu Buhari, is completely unacceptable. Suleman warned that if Nigeria must continue to exist as an indivisible entity, then the President must come out to assure Nigerians that his administration would desist from being used as a platform for such primitive persecution and mindless killings.
