Fitness tracker company Misfit revealed their first touchscreen smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor, which will sell for $199 when it is released.\nSee also: Best smartwatches 3 weeks ago Visually, the Vapor looks very similar to many Android Wear devices. It has a 44mm stainless steel case with an 1.39-inch round AMOLED display, and inside it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100, 4GB of onboard storage and a battery that is suppose to last up to two days on a single charge. The watch itself is charged with a magnetic cradle. The bezel of the device has been designed so that you can touch for accessing the Vapor’s user interface.\nThe Vapor also has a gyroscope, an optical heart rate sensor, GPS support, and microphones, along with WiFi connectivity. It is supposed to be “swimproof” and water resistant at up to 50 meters.\nWhen the Misfit Vapor does come out, it will be available in Jet Black and Rose Gold colors. There’s no specific release date for the Vapor yet, other than sometime “later this year”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T18:16:54.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
