We are jumping into a precipice, but neither Brussels, nor Berlin or Washington for that matter will even turn their heads when we hit the bottom,” Samardzic warned. \nCommenting on recent complaints about Russia allegedly arming Serbia, he said that the US is supplying arms to Kosovo Albanians and that a complete demilitarization of Kosovo would be the right way to go. \nSpeaking about the scenarios of a future EU proposed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and the calls within the EU for a so-called \" multi-speed Europe ,\" Samardzic said it was the only way to prevent the breakup of at least the “core EU.” \nHe also underscored the importance of a fiscal union between economically advanced European nations without which no “healthy currency” is possible. \n“A fiscal union could offer a way out this crisis. We need to save what can still be saved and then all others could be saved too if only the ‘core EU’ countries are ready to finance this,” Slobodan Samardzic continued. © Sputnik/ Slobodan Samardzic \n“What we have now is a complex structure of countries with different economic potential and traditions that are hard to manage from a single center. They want to have a simpler system and rightly so, but what is going to come out of this is anyone’s guess,” he said in conclusion. © AP Photo/ Andy Wong 'It's Up to Them': Amid 'Two-Speed Europe' Talk, China Pledges Support for EU During an EU summit in Versailles on March 6, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Spain called for the creation of a so-called \"multi-speed\" Europe.\nFrench President Francois Hollande said in turn that the option of a \"multi-speed\" Europe, with different countries integrating at different levels, has been resisted for a long time but is now being considered as a possibility. \nNever miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T09:40:26.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
