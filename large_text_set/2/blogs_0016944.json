King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 13 hours ago 9 \nDeftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter, one of the first notable metal musicians who put extended-range guitars on the map, confessed he was actually very much against seven-strings at first. \nHe told TC Electronic : \"From the beginning, I was always playing six-strings. I used to shun [seven-strings], like, 'Never seven-string!' That was all through the '90s. Late '90s is when I first got into Meshuggah, once I realized they were killing it on the 7-string, I made the decision instantly! \n\"And right after I got into 7-strings, which was around 2000 - that's when Meshuggah busted out their 8-string sound, I was like, 'Oh man!' I wasn't making decisions based on what they were doing, what made me do it was that - I had shunned the 7 for my entire existence up to that point. \n\"The 8 was entirely brand new in my perspective. I was like, 'You know what? There's not a lot of people doing that right now. I think I wanna jump on that wagon early, have some fun there.' I definitely can't do what dudes I love do with it, but who cares? [Chuckles]\" \nAsked on how the extra low-end impacted his playing style, Stephen replied: \"I got stuck playing all on the seventh string all the time and forgot there were other six strings there. \n\"So when I first went to the 8, I got stuck on the eighth string, I'm not even noticing the bottom, but not as long as it did when I got from 6 to 7. I was like, 'Alright, get back on all the other ones.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:43:07.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
