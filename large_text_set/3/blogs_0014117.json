They remind you of Pumbaa from The Lion King, they’re furry, and they’re pretty adorable. Well, not these wild boars. Hundreds of them have simply taken over two Japanese towns near the exclusion zone near the abandoned Fukushima power station there. What’s more, they’re radioactive. Radioactive wild boars are just hanging around. What even is this world?\nSix years ago the Fukushima plant had a nuclear meltdown, which forced the town residents to have to leave the town as well as its surrounding areas. Now that it’s time for the residents to return home, there’s a bit of a problem. The boars are taking over like it’s their home only, scavenging for food, and essentially chilling out where all the people should be living.\nThe boars have become irradiated since they’ve been chowing down on plants and food left in the area that were exposed to the meltdown, and they’ve been exposed as such to radiation levels way higher than what the government has stated are safe for living creatures. Hunters have been dispatched to take the boars away from both towns of Name and Tomioka, and then at the end of March residents are going to be asked to return to their homes.\nThe evacuation orders will be lifted, and if residents don’t end up gong back to the area, they may risk losing some of their housing benefits. But if there were a whole bunch of radioactive boars roaming around where my home used to be, I might be a bit hesitant to go back home too. Hopefully, the issue will be resolved with minimal damage to either the boars or the area. And hopefully, everyone can go back to their homes without too many issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T08:13:44.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
