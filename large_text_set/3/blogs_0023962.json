Media caption \"It's other people's loved ones - you don't do this\": People gather at Philadelphia graveyard \nBut Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said on Thursday the latest suspect's motives are unclear. \nIn one of the threats made against a Jewish Community Center on 18 January, a caller is heard saying: \"In a short time, a large number of Jews are going to be slaughtered. \n\"There's going to be a bloodbath that's going to take place in a short time.\" \nInvestigators say the Israeli teen used camouflage technologies to disguise the origin of the dozens of calls. \n\"He didn't use regular phone lines. He used different computer systems so he couldn't be backtracked,\" Mr Rosenfeld said. \nHe is also suspected of making threats against Delta Air Lines, forcing a plane to make an emergency landing in 2015 in order to be searched for explosives. \nIsraeli's minister of public safety Gilad Erdan congratulated the police for the arrest.

Media caption The BBC spoke to a Muslim-American couple targeted by an abusive caller \nAccording to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the army had refused to draft him on personal grounds, after determining that he was unfit for service. \nIn the US, more than 120 hoax bomb threats have been made against Jewish schools, synagogues and cultural centres since earlier January, according to the Anti-Defamation League. \nThere have also been at least three vandalism attacks made against US cemeteries in recent months. \nThe spike in anti-Jewish incidents led to criticism of the Trump administration, with some saying they did not react quickly or forcefully enough to the hate threats. \nLast month, the White House denounced the threats and rejected \"anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms\". \nEarlier this month the Department of Homeland Security condemned the \"unacceptable and disturbing rise in the number of apparent hate-inspired attacks and harassment against individuals and communities\". \nIt pledged to provide \"support to groups affected by these incidents to enhance public safety\".
