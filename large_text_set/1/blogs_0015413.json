Image: Twitter/@ArcticDavos Climate Researchers Are Setting Up an Arctic Base Camp at Davos   03:53   \nOn Tuesday morning, a team of climate scientists were busy setting up a mock Arctic base camp at the Swiss resort that is hosting politicians, celebrities, and the global economic elite for the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week. \nTonight, they’ll sleep in those tents. Tomorrow, they’ll try to convince the most powerful people in the world that they should give a shit about the Arctic, an area of increasing economic importance that’s nonetheless hugely threatened by climate change. \n“The main objective is to explain why Arctic [climate] change poses global risks for societies and economies around the world,” said Gail Whiteman , a professor of sustainability in business at the University of Lancaster and the woman heading up Arctic Basecamp Davos , in an interview from the camp.

At the end of October, Arctic ice was at its second-lowest point since we started keeping track. \nArctic Basecamp Davos will feature talks from the likes of Al Gore and David Miller, the former Toronto mayor who’s now head of World Wildlife Fund Canada. But the meeting will also try and connect businesspeople and other Davos types directly with scientists who know what’s happening the Arctic, without the Davos filter. \nIt won’t be easy, since the focus is, of course, the world economy and keeping the whole system moving along, overcoming or deferring crises. The WEF’s global risk report pegged climate change at number two on the list of global risks—to the economy, of course. Climate change is on the agenda, but in the context of issues like carbon markets.

Early headlines have been about China’s move to take on the role of global free trade champion, now that Trump— no fan of trade deals like the TPP —is headed for the White House. \nWhatever comes of Arctic Basecamp Davos, one hopes that at the very least it provides a much-needed reality check.
