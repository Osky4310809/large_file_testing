Indulgence without discipline is not the answer!\nYou can see it on their cute little faces. That feeling of entitlement. The knowledge that they just have to scrunch up those cute-as-button noses and let out a whimper to get anything they demand. That knowing look in the calculating little eyes; the confidence that they have their parents wrapped around their chubby little fingers. The knowledge that they just have to throw back their heads and look up with those innocent faces to set parents drooling, showering them with love and kisses.\nIt is sickening to watch parents at an airport or other public places overindulging young brats. Today fathers tend to be as indulgent and wonderstruck as mothers have naturally always been. As a result, neither parent is willing to play the disciplinary role in a balanced good cop/bad cop strategy of bringing up kids. Who then is the disciplinarian? Neither, it seems. In fact even when teachers or schools try to discipline or pull up a child for a misdemeanor, most parents are affronted and react with aggression.\nAs the Indian educated urban middle class sees a steady increase in DISK (double income, single kid) families, what are we doing to our children? Research reports that 10 per cent of Indian couples are opting to have just one child and that around 25 per cent of college educated women prefer a single child! One child means better quality living and education with lesser spends for sure, but also more indulgence, more pampering and spoiling, and more emotional issues for the child. As a result, we are looking at a dangerously self-centred, uncaring generation!\nWhat kind of self-obsessed, overindulged monsters are we bringing up? Perhaps some parents find it easier to give in to a child’s demands rather than handle a tantrum. Maybe others wish to relive their childhood by giving a child all they themselves didn’t have as children. Yet others could be focusing fiercely on the shared love for a child, in order to push other issues to the background, where these fester and wait – forgotten, but ticking steadily like a time bomb. Whatever the reason, imbalanced pampering is bad for your child!\nWhatever happened to responsible upbringing? Parental duty is not just to protect and indulge, but also to inculcate values and enable a kid to grow up independent and self-reliant. Parents must show by example, as well as actively teach kids about good and bad, about consequences, about the criticality of mutual relationships, positive interactions, and the importance of being responsible citizens.\nWhen you have plenty, it is natural to wish to indulge every whim of those you love best in the world. But sometimes you need to take a harder line. If children grow up thinking everything is just a wish away, they are unlikely to appreciate the importance of hard work. If they are not taught to apologise and atone for misdeeds, these may translate to illegal activities later. When you do not tick off your child for hitting another or using bad language, you are corrupting his/her sense of morality. When you over-protect children, you are not allowing them to create their own armour against the world.\nGiving in to demands and ignoring warning signs of bad or delinquent behavior ensures children become egoistic, self-centered, attention-seeking adults with an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and uncaring about others.\nInterestingly a recent TV show, Big Switch, aimed at teaching pampered, rich kids the value of money, relationships and hard work. In their first season they attached rich kids to slum buddies encouraging them to help fulfill their wishes. But young parents need to make that “big switch” in everyday lives. Born to and surrounded by New Age technology, our kids may be much smarter than we were at their age, but they still need to appreciate and respect the privileges their parents bring them. And they need to be made capable enough to build their own lives from scratch.\nIn short, it is imperative that children be kept grounded and disciplined despite wealth and indulgence, if you wish them to grow up as responsible, well-adjusted and happy people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:30:21.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
