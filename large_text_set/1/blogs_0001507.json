We’re getting a brand-new Star Wars movie, Game of Thrones comes back with its penultimate season, and Marvel’s got not one, not two, but three major films debuting this year. Plus, you’ve got a ton of books and comic books. What isn’t there to love? Advertisement \nPersonally, I’m really, really, really hoping that Wonder Woman fixes DC’s cinematic slump and finally puts the franchise on the right path. This one seems like the franchise’s last real attempt to work, and I’m crossing all the fingers in the world for it. I’m also really excited for the latest iteration of A Series of Unfortunate Events (Neil Patrick Harris looks phenomenal), as well as Fox’s Legion . Plus, Chuck Wendig’s Aftermath Trilogy comes to a close in February. It’s had its ups and downs, but it’s a pretty great addition to the Star Wars canon. \nSo, share up, what are you most psyched to see or read in 2017? Are there any announcements you’re hoping for as well ( The Winds of Winter , maybe)? Let’s get excited for 2017 in the comments!
