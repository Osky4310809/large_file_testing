Our test kitchen says that making a series of small changes is one easy way to enjoy big results. \n\nWe asked the cooks in the Williams-Sonoma Test Kitchen to share their favorite secrets for maximum health and wellness with minimal effort. Read on to discover how five simple changes can help you achieve a feel-good lifestyle. \n1. Drink Water Instead \n\nHere’s one crazy-easy, cost-free change anyone can make: Simply choose water over other beverages that typically have hidden sugars and calories. If you’re really craving a sweeter beverage, try diluting some fruit juice with sparkling or still water. 2. Prep Ahead for the Week \n\nOn the weekend, get a head start on tasks like rinsing and prepping your greens and veggies, cooking off grains or beans, making a vinaigrette or caramelizing onions. Weeknight favorites like salads, omelets, frittatas or veggie tacos come together quickly when a lot of the legwork has already been done. Not only are you doing yourself a favor by cooking at home, but your future self will thank you! 3. A Little Bit of Cheese (to Go a Long Way) \n\nUse just a little bit of cheese to finish soups, salads, tacos and other dishes. Select harder cheeses that pack a lot of punch and flavor without fat, like Parmigiano-Reggiano, Pecorino Romano or aged gouda. Another great option is to opt for softer cheeses, like goat cheese or sheep’s milk feta, where a little goes a long way. 4. (Good) Fat is Your Friend \n\nFat adds flavor and helps keep you satiated, so you won’t be grabbing for a snack about 30 minutes after your meal. Go for anti-inflammatory fats, like mono-unsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids, by doing small things like adding avocado to sandwiches and extra-virgin olive oil to salads. 5. Omit One Thing \n\nThe test kitchen suggests picking one vice to omit from your diet for a particular day of the week. Think meatless Mondays, going dairy-free on Wednesdays, no processed foods on Thursday—you get the idea. \n\nWhat feel-better changes are you implementing this year?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T09:53:51.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
