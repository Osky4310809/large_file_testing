As Entertainment Weekly reports, the post-Inauguration gathering will feature performances by headliners Janelle Monáe , Maxwell , and Angelique Kidjo , plus former former Dirty Projectors members Amber Coffman , Samantha Ronson , Indigo Girls , and Emily Wells .\nA number of other acts — including Questlove , Grimes , Matt and Kim , KT Tunstall , Neko Case , Rakim , TV on the Radio , and Lila Downs — are part of the March’s Artist Table and will take part in sister events scheduled across the country.\n“I am honored to join this critical movement to bring justice and equality to all,” Monáe said in a statement. “Music has always been a powerful tool for galvanizing unity and I believe that singing and standing together, our voices will be stronger than any force that tries to repress us.”\nSpeaking of forces trying to repress us, it bears mentioning that the actual Inauguration’s lineup is almost laughably lackluster next to that of the Women’s March. Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration features the likes of 3 Doors Down, Toby Keith, and YouTube performers who were somehow coerced into committing career suicide. Hell, even the Women’s March after-party has the Inauguration beat with performances by The National and Sleater-Kinney .\nFor a full list of Washington, D.C., parties that are far better than whatever Trump’s getting up to, check out D.C.
