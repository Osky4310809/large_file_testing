There will be no concomitant increase fares,” Quiambao said responding to Senator Grace Poe’s query. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Wala rin pong effect sa fare sa MRT, sa ating future MRT-7 at ito pong common station. Totally separate yung pong fare mechanism ng MRT 7 at ito pong common station,” the DOTr official added. \nIt was Poe, chair of the committee on public services, who initiated the inquiry on the common station project that would connect the LRT1, MRT 3 and the soon-to-be-built MRT Line 7. \n“Walang sneaky ha na bigla na lang kasi may mga ganito, ganyan, yun pala pinapasok nyo na yung cost dyan,” the senator said. \n“Wala po Madam chair, as far as the legal is concerned. We’ve studied the MOA ( memorandum of agreement ). We’ve made sure under the instruction po of Secretary (Arthur) Tugade that there will no concomitant increase in fares of the lines,” the DOTr official added. \nThe MOA was signed last January 18 for the construction of the project, which will commence in the last quarter of the year and is expected to be completed by April 2019.
