However, she said does not care what anyone else thinks of her. \n\"I'm OK with myself. I sleep pretty good at night,\" she said. \nAnthony has been back in headlines recently, as she was spotted at an anti-Trump rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., in early February. Also, the judge in the case, Belvin Perry Jr., recently said he believes Anthony probably killed her daughter by accident but stands by the jury's decision to acquit her for murder, according to the Orlando Sentinel . \nAnthony currently lives in West Palm Beach with Patrick McKenna, a private detective who was the lead investigator on her defense team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T22:05:35.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
