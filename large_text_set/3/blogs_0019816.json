Three members of the team were hugely unpopular \nMichael, fair play to him, only took the 'low' offer and added another £300 to the team total. \nBut Carole chose to go for -£1,000 and Georgia opted for -£2,000, resulting in accusations they 'backstabbed' their teammate to win the cash. It's fair to say everyone on Twitter was pretty angry. \nYou can see evidence of that below - but raging the most was Shayna's stepdad. In the hilarious clip he clutches the remote and launches a foul-mouthed attack on Carole, who took the offer from the Chaser. \nHe says: \"F***ing going on the programmes and then take a minus offer. Not impressed. (Photo: Twitter/@Shanyaaa24) \n\"F***in' boy's hard work undone.\" \nBasically, it's how every viewer of The Chase felt last night. \nShayna told Mirror Online her family sits down to watch the show every night before dinner at 5pm and her step dad is \"always talking to the TV\". \nThe clip, which she shared on Twitter, has had over 2,000 retweets since last night. Shayna said: \"He's now the family celeb thanks to me.\" \nOther viewers admitted they were also swearing at the TV, called him a legend and said it's the \"funniest thing they've ever seen\". Someone even started a #JusticeForDarragh hashtag And one suggested they should set up a GoFundMe page \nAnother person went a step further and ACTUALLY SET ONE UP. There were Wanted posters And someone even amended the dictionary definition for 'coward' One person tweeted the police Trump has got nothing on The Chase \nThe backlash has even prompted Darragh, the contestant who put £9,000 into the pot, to take to Twitter in defence of his teammates. \nHe said: \"Ease off my teammates. It's a lot easier on the couch.\" \nHe then added: \"Thanks for all the support but I would appreciate it if people eased off my teammates. Its (sic) hard in front of the cameras.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T14:44:11.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
