Because no matter how well you shoot your photos, there are always little things to fix and retouch afterwards.\nHere are free and paid tools—including software, services, and apps—that you can use to make your pictures more compelling. \nPaid Photo Editing Tools 1. Photoshop Elements \nThe Photoshop suite is the ultimate in image editing. Elements offers every editing tool you need and then some. This is top-of-the-line software, which means that it’s not the cheapest item here.\nNote: Consider also Photoshop CC , the latest edition of Photoshop that costs $9.99 every month.\n2. Photoshop Lightroom \nElements offers huge functionality in editing individual pictures. Lightroom focuses on editing in batches. So it retains many of the features you’d find in Elements, but is especially powerful at organizing and editing pictures at a large scale.\n3. Camera+ \nCamera+ is an app that significantly enhances the capabilities of shooting pictures on your phone. You can change shooting modes, adjust touch exposure, and set up a grid to guide your shots. And, it’s only $1.99.\n4. Fiverr \nFiverr is a marketplace for small, inexpensive gigs. There are a lot of people who offer to edit photos, all with their own specialities. Too many people to look through? Rank them by “Recommended,” “High Rating,” and “Express Gigs.”\n5. Shopify Experts \nOkay, maybe you’re willing to spend more than $5, and on more professional agents. Well head over to the Shopify Experts page. There are dozens of photography experts you can reach out to for photography services.\n6. Tucia \nIf you don’t want to spend time hunting down the right person to send photos to, consider Tucia, an agency that has edited over 3.7 million photos. There are three tiers of services for different features. One cool service it offers for every tier: unlimited free revisions.\n7. Portrait Professionals \nIf your products involve human models, take a look at Portrait Professionals. It’s a software tool that’s optimized for airbrushing portraits to fix blemishes and reshape the face.\n8. Pixelz \nFor $1.45 per image, Pixelz uses proprietary software to strip your images of their backgrounds so that you can substitute something in its place (for example, pure white, or the right shade of blue). It promises a 24-hour turnaround.\n9. Mister Clipping \nMister Clipping makes paths by hand, not software, to remove the backgrounds of your photos. Its prices range from $0.95 to $9.95 per image, and a free trial is available.\n10. KeyShot \nKeyShot is an image rendering piece of software that can create high-definition visuals and models. They can be made so high-def that they look like real photographs. In the right hands, KeyShot can do wonders, and is used sometimes by big companies to create their marketing materials. At $995, it’s the priciest item on this list, but there is a 14-day free trial for you to see if you could use it.\n11. Digital Tutors \nWe’ve given you some pretty sophisticated software tools for editing photos. We wanted to include Digital Tutors because it’s one of the best learning resources online. It has lessons on many aspects of using Photoshop, KeyShot, and design more generally.\nFree Photo Editing Tools Okay, those paid tools are great, but if you happen to be on a budget or don't want to invest a lot of money, no worries. Take a look at the tools below. They may just get you to where you need to be.\n12. GIMP \nGIMP is the most sophisticated free image-editing tool. You can use it to retouch, edit, and draw. Just download the software and you’re ready to start editing.\n13. Fotor \nWant to edit online, directly on your browser? Take a look at Fotor. It offers editing and beauty retouching. Most cool is its High Dynamic Range feature: you can take three photos with different exposures to combine them into a single image, with the best light and tone from each of the separate photos.\n14. PicMonkey \nPicMonkey is another great online photo editor with a very cool feature: Collage. You can take various photos and arrange them together. If you have lots of products, you can collage them together as perhaps a banner image for your store or in an email newsletter.\n15. Pixlr \nThe Pixlr editor is one of the most widely used image editors online. It has three editions, all free: Pixlr Editor, Pixlr Express, and Pixlr O-Matic. The latter two can also be used as apps.\n16. Photo Editor by Aviary \nThis is a free app that you can use to edit images on your phone. Enhance with hi-def, fix red-eyes, and adjust various aspects of lighting.\n17. Photoshop Express \nWe’ve opened with a very expensive piece of Photoshop software, and we feel that it’s fitting to close with a free one. Photoshop Express is an app for your phone with slightly fewer functionalities than Photoshop Touch. It lets you crop, fix red-eye, share on social media, and more.\nConclusion With recommendations of tools and resources for shooting , a step-by-step guide to using them , and tools to edit the pictures afterwards, you’re running out of excuses for poor-looking products.
