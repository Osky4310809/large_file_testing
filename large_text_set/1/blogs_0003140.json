(Rich Pedroncelli/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   5:54 PM \nALBANY — Former model and sexual abuse victim Nikki DuBose is coming to the state Capitol Wednesday with a message for state lawmakers — children need to be protected. \nDuBose is the featured speaker at a rally being planned by advocates for legislation that would change New York’s statute of limitations and make it easier for child sex abuse victims to obtain justice in state courts. \n“We are talking about kids,” DuBose, 31, told The Daily News. \n“Why is it OK for an innocent child to be sexually abused and to have his rights, his soul, his identity, his emotions his life taken away from that very moment and for him to not receive justice?” DuBose continued. “Why is that OK?” \nDuBose, who quit modeling four years ago and recently wrote a book about her experiences in the industry and her battles with addiction and mental illness, said she hopes her story of growing up in an abusive home and the sexual abuse she suffered as a model will help convince lawmakers the law needs to be changed. \n“These are real things that happen that happen every single day,” DuBose said. “They happened to me. I can tell you it completely screwed up my life.” \nDuBose said she was sexually abused as a child by both her mother, who is now deceased, and a male family member who she declined to name because of possible legal ramifications. \nThat abuse, she said, traumatized her and made her more vulnerable to the sexual abuse she suffered as a model. DuBose began modeling at 16. \n“I was raped as a model,” said DuBose, adding that she was too traumatized at the time to pursue charges against her attacker. \n“When you are sexually abused as a child it desensitizes you,” she said. “You are more likely to put yourself in dangerous situations.” DuBose said she was sexually abused as a child by both her mother, who is now deceased, and a male family member who she declined to name because of possible legal ramifications.

Under current law, a person has until their 23rd birthday. \nAdvocates are also pushing for a one-year window to revive old cases, and treat public and private institutions the same. Currently, someone abused at a school or other public institution must file a notice of intent to sue within 90 days of the incident. \nSenate Republicans and some legislative Democrats have opposed the idea of a one-year window to revive old cases, fearing it would spark a torrent of frivolous cases. \nDespite a fervent campaign by the Daily News and advocates last year, the legislation failed to win approval in either the Senate or Assembly. \nAdvocates are hoping for better results in 2017. Wednesday marks the official start of the Legislature’s annual session. \n“We need to remind all our elected officials that this isn’t about politics, it’s not about parties, it’s about protecting children, not predators,” said Gary Greenberg, founder of the Fighting for Children Political Action Committee.
