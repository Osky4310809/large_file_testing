As long he speaks with an inside voice , it appears many in the media are OK with him telling lies and spreading xenophobia .

Twitter \nThe White House has provided no evidence to back up this assertion whatsoever. \nLong story short: President Trump had quite a weekend, and while many thought his speech was a turning point, it seems they couldn’t have been more wrong.
