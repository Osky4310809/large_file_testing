Photo: Apple \nDevelopers hoping to attend WWDC 2017 can now officially enter Apple’s lottery for the chance to shell out a few grand on the trip out to San Jose. \nRegistration for the WWDC lottery is open from Monday, March 27 until Friday, March 31 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. Along with developer entries, Apple is also accepting applications for its WWDC 2017 scholarships that include a free ticket and lodging for the event. \nWWDC 2017 attendees will be selected via a random ticket selection process. About 5,000 developers will be selected to attend the event alongside Apple’s 1,000 engineers who will provide detailed information on the various aspects of building apps. \niOS 11, macOS 10.13, tvOS 11 and watchOS 4 are all expected to be unveiled at the event. It’s still unclear if new Mac hardware will be announced. \nThis year Apple changed the location of WWDC from the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco to the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. The change should make it cheaper for developers to find hotels and other accommodations. Apple will notify all WWDC lottery winners by April 3 at 5PM PT, which is when credit cards will be charged the $1,600 entry fee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T01:10:52.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
