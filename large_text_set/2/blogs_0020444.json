Brady/Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division The Hidden History of Photography and New York By Jordan G. Teicher Feb. 22, 2017 “It is one of the most beautiful discoveries of the age.” So wrote Prof. Samuel Finley Breese Morse on March 9, 1839, in a letter from Paris published in The New York Observer later that spring. The discovery was the daguerreotype process, a technique that produced a unique image on a polished, silver-plated copper sheet. Just two days earlier, Professor Morse had become the first American to see Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre’s invention, more than five months before the astronomer François Arago would officially introduce it to the world in a presentation at the French Academy of Science. Morse, professor of painting and sculpture at the University of the City of New-York (now New York University) and the inventor of the telegraph, had tried to fix the image of a camera obscura decades earlier. But he found producing a “true image” to be “impracticable” and abandoned the effort. Examining Daguerre’s detailed images, he knew he was witnessing an extraordinary achievement. “The exquisite minuteness of the delineation cannot be conceived,” he wrote. “No painting or engraving ever approached it.” Morse’s early introduction to the daguerreotype was just the first of many firsts that New Yorkers claim in the medium’s nascent history. New York City was not only the birthplace of American photography, but also the setting for some of its most substantial early commercial and technological developments. Just a few months after Morse’s visit, European newspapers bearing detailed descriptions of Daguerre’s process reached New York City by boat. By the end of the month, the Englishman D.W. Seager had made the first daguerreotype in America — a view of St. Paul’s Church and a corner of the Astor House in Lower Manhattan— and displayed it at the shop of a chemist, James Chilton, at 263 Broadway. Soon after, Mr. Seager delivered a lecture on the process at the Stuyvesant Institute that inspired Alexander S. Wolcott, a manufacturer of instruments and dental equipment, and his business partner, John Johnson, to build the prototype for a “studio camera,” the first to receive a patent in the United States. In October, Mr. Wolcott used the camera to make a photo of Mr. Johnson, the historian William Welling said, on a plate “only 3/8th inch square.” It is believed to be the first photographic portrait made in America, though other New Yorkers have also claimed the distinction.

Together they created a primitive gallery with a glass ceiling on the roof of the school’s University Building at Washington Square East, where, even on sunny days, their subjects had to sit still five to seven minutes for an exposure to be made. After the summer, Morse moved to a studio at the corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets, where, for $25 to $50, he offered instruction to aspiring image-makers, including many, like Jeremiah Gurney and Mathew Brady, who became among the country’s finest. From its first year, the daguerreotype was a novelty that inspired curiosity and excitement in New York City, due in part to the arrival in November 1839 of François Gouraud, a friend and student of Daguerre’s who was determined to popularize the process in America. He opened an exhibition room in the Granite Building on the corner of Chambers Street and Broadway, where he displayed the latest daguerreotypes from Paris and gave lectures, which were open to the public for 25 cents. European daguerreotypists like Frederic Goupil-Fesquet and Horace Vernet used the process to make documentary landscapes of exotic destinations. In New York, meanwhile, early landscapes were rare, and largely made on paper. Victor Prevost, a Frenchman who studied the calotype process with the photographer Gustave LeGray, opened a commercial studio at 627 Broadway in the early 1950s and began methodically photographing prominent city buildings and streets on sensitized wax paper. The aim, it seems, was to publish the images in a book, but that never seems to have been achieved. While others, including Morse and Brady, took the occasional street scene, New York’s entrepreneurial photographers knew that the real photography market was in portraits, and they worked singlemindedly to capitalize on it. Experiments in lens design from New Yorkers like J.G. Wolf, as well as improvements in chemical compounds, served to shorten exposure speeds and improve the customer experience. Photo Samuel F. B. Morse, c. 1860. Credit Mathew B. Brady/Museum of the City of New York By 1840, these advances were enough to pave the way for photography’s professionalization. Mr. Wolcott and Mr. Johnson were the first in the country to open a commercial portrait gallery, and others soon followed. Images in New York cost $3 to $10, a sum that allowed more people than before to see themselves reflected in a portrait, an experience both strange and wonderful. “They were not all that cheap, but they were so much cheaper than having a painted portrait. It really democratized the whole idea of having your image for yourself,” said Miles Orvell, an English professor at Temple University and the author of American Photography. By 1844, there were 16 daguerreotype galleries in New York City. Less than a decade later, according to Professor Orvell, there were 86, more than in any other metropolis in the country. The epicenter of the trade was Broadway, home to the largest and most lavish galleries in the city, which served as both studios and exhibition spaces. For Brady, who became famous photographing “men of achievement” including presidents and statesmen, these portrait rooms served a grand social function. “He displayed these images with the idea that the way to improve character was to hold up these models of what great people are,” Professor Orvell said. New York’s booming gallery business concurrently created a new industry for photographic materials. In the 1840s, Edward Anthony, a student of Morse’s, established the first depot to serve daguerreotypists exclusively. Through the 1850s, the city’s status as a major port made it the center for the supply of plates, cases and other photo goods to the nation. “The whole history of photographic equipment development and manufacturing began in New York City,” said Geoffrey Berliner, the executive director of Penumbra Foundation , a nonprofit photographic arts organization in New York that offers classes in the daguerreotype and other 19th-century processes. Until the 1860s, the daguerreotype was the main event in American photography. But it was complicated and labor-intensive, so when nimbler, cheaper processes came along, the daguerreotype all but disappeared. “The history of photography is a history in some sense of the changing of technology,” said Sean Corcoran, prints and photographs curator at the Museum of the City of New York. New York City’s contribution to American photography and American culture ultimately transcended any particular technology, Orvell said. By making images essential to the way people saw themselves and others, the city’s photographers, for better or worse, changed the fabric of American social life. “Photography in this early period you might say is establishing in a popular form the major premise of our way of interpreting other people,” Professor Orvell said, “which is that we can tell who people are by looking at them.” Follow @ teicherj   You can also find Lens  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:18:27.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
