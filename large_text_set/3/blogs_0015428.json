Cleveland eventually hired David Blatt, who they fired at mid-season during his second year and replaced with Lue. \nIn May of 2015, Calipari signed an extension with UK through 2022 which guarantees him $54 million over the next seven seasons. \nHis son, Brad, will be a sophomore guard for the Wildcats next season and he also has once again signed the nation's top incoming recruiting class.
