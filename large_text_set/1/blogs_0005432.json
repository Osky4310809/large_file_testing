Jennifer Lawrence confessed in 2015 to having hit a bong prior to attending the Academy Awards, while Susan Sarandon once told “Watch What Happens Live” host Andy Cohen that she’s shown up stoned to “almost all [Hollywood events] except the Oscars.” Last year’s goodies bag for Academy Award nominees even included a $249 Haze Dual vaporizer.\nSarah Silverman had LIQUID POT in her clutch on the #Emmys red carpet, y'all. pic.twitter.com/eaO1odQ92l \n— Laurel Pinson (@laurelpinson) August 25, 2014 \n\nGetting stoned at the Globes, long known as Hollywood’s booziest and most party-hearty awards show, promises to be easier than ever this year. In the not-too-distant past, joints were discreetly consumed on the smoking patio of the Beverly Hilton, the longtime home of the ceremony, or in a hot-boxed green room.\n“But right now, it’s all about the vape,” said an awards-show veteran who currently works for a well-known TV star.\nVaporizers, which can hold marijuana or hash oil, give off no telltale odor, unlike a skunky joint.\n“You go to wherever the e-cigarettes are being smoked and enjoy,” the celeb employee said. “Nobody can tell the difference, [except] that we’re passing our vape pens to each other. Cigarette guys don’t do that.”\nBrowner, for one, doesn’t bother to hide. “Most people are scared to light joints [on the smoking patio], but I break the ice,” she said. “I take half a puff and somebody is grabbing it away from me [to smoke]. Then I light another one and another one after that. Suddenly, it’s an hour later and you remember that you have to get back in.”\nThese events are so long and drawn out, it could be that weed is the thing that makes them tolerable.\nShe recalled taking a limo to an awards show with a celebrity customer and her entourage. As the car nosed toward the venue, the actress realized that she had made a terrible mistake — and it had nothing to do with wearing the same dress as Gwyneth Paltrow. When the camera-flashing paparazzi and long red carpet came into view, paranoia coursed through her brain’s amygdala region and the effects of too much marijuana overtook the starlet’s body.\n“She had eaten a 250 milligram edible and thought it was a 25 — on an empty stomach,” Browner said. “She couldn’t bring herself to walk the carpet. Her guests got out and the driver took her around to a back entrance.”\nAmong Sunday night’s attendees are several outspoken marijuana advocates. Donald Glover, who scored nominations as star and co-creator of the FX show “Atlanta,” acknowledged in 2013, “I smoke weed all the time, I do edibles all the time, I’m always high.” Evan Rachel Wood — nominated tonight for best actress in a drama TV series for her work on HBO’s “Westworld” — was pregnant in 2013 when she tweeted, “I cant smoke any weed right now. Damnit!” Seth Rogen has publicly chatted about getting stoned with pal Jonah Hill, a nominee in the best actor in a movie musical or comedy category for “War Dogs.” (In fact, Rogen has said that the plot for last year’s “Sausage Party” grew out of a smoke session with Hill.) And “Hacksaw Ridge” star Andrew Garfield, up for best actor honors in a dramatic motion picture, recently revealed that he celebrated his 29th birthday in 2012 by munching pot brownies at Disneyland. He described the experience as “literally heaven.”\nRachel Evan Wood, Jonah Hill, and Donald Glover are all marijuana advocates, and will all be in attendance Sunday night.

A little over a decade later, Robert Mitchum got himself busted for possession. Marilyn Monroe can be seen toking what appears to be a hand-rolled joint in a home movie, and Peter Sellers turned Britt Ekland onto her first spliff in the 1960s. Over the next 50 years — behind the scenes, at least — pot would become as common as Dean Martin’s cocktails and get us to the point where Bill Maher uses cannabis to jack up his liberal bona fides, Cameron Diaz casually talks about having bought marijuana from classmate Snoop Dogg while in high school, and Bethenny Frankel goes public with the possibility of launching Skinnygirl-branded weed.\n\nFor so much loosey-goosey behavior, however, some nonsmokers are less than lit by it all. One source who’s tagged along to Emmys, Oscars and Globes awards shows with industry pals gripes about the brazenness of it all.\n“There’s no getting around this: If the event takes place in LA, people will be smoking inside, outside, on the way in,” he told The Post. “When it was illegal, people exercised some caution. Now, with the stuff legalized, it’s, ‘Hit the gas, buddy, and smoke away.’ ”\nYet the source admitted that he sees the benefits: “These events are so long and drawn out, it could be that weed is the thing that makes them tolerable.”\nShort of getting paralyzingly wasted on unexpectedly loaded edibles, some Hollywood insiders said that weed can enhance grand entrances. “A red carpet is the best place to be stoned,” the television star’s employee told The Post. “I walked one completely high. Marijuana improved the experience of cameras going off, people smiling, music blasting and reporters stepping up with microphones. Everything gets better with pot. Food tastes better and the red carpet feels better.”\nWorld-class stoner Tommy Chong agrees. Once half of the weed-loving comedy duo Cheech and Chong, he appeared as Yax in the award nominated “Zootopia” and will roll up to the Globes “as high as possible.”\nHe told The Post, “I prefer joints to vapes and will be smoking them beforehand and on the way. If I start to come down, though, I’ll vape from my seat. You crouch, take a hit and palm the thing like a magician. I’ll be sitting with my castmates” — among his co-stars are J.K. Simmons, Shakira, Octavia Spencer and Idris Elba.\n“Hopefully,” he added, “they will want to get high as well.”\nGet America Stoned Again pic.twitter.com/SHMbpTbefu \n— Tommy Chong (@tommychong) November 11, 2016 \n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T00:38:52.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
