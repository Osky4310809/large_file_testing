To see what parts of our routines would be most disrupted, we chose a variety of occupations, regardless of the gender disparity, that a person is most likely to encounter on a day-to-day basis, then calculated what percentage of those jobs are held by women. Here’s how a day might go if all women were to stay out of work.\nWhile plenty of occupations are overwhelmingly male, like roofers and mining machine operators, women make up a large percentage of the occupations with which many of us interact on a common basis. And that’s not going to change. Women are now more likely to have a college degree than men, so the workforce will only become more dependent on them as time passes.\nMethodology \nWe examined American Community Survey records for the years 2013-2015, grouping responses by gender and the 2010 Census definitions of occupation . For activities that involve multiple professions, like seeing a doctor, the percentage is weighted by the number of total people in each individual job.
