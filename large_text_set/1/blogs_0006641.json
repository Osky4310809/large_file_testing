The 2018 Ford F-150 will make its debut at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. \nWhat’s new? New front and rear styling, advanced tech including available Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection, and improved engines. The latter includes an all-new 3.0 litre Power Stroke V6 turbodiesel and enhanced V6 and V8 petrol engines. \nThe 2018 F-150 line-up, from XL to the range topping Limited, receive new grilles, headlamps and bumpers that create a visually wider and more planted stance. Ford has also gone for maximum differentiation between the series. For instance, on the Sport Package-equipped Lariat F-150, the signature twin bars are painted in body colour for a “custom athletic appearance”. There are also six new wheel designs, ranging from 17 to 22 inches in diameter. \nA new sculpted tailgate with deeper accent form and stamped “F-150” are flanked by new tail lamp designs. For further style differentiation, a tailgate applique adds a horizontal element to King Ranch, Platinum and Limited versions. The Blue Oval’s goal was to enhance the F-150’s “milled from a block of high-strength, military-grade, aluminium alloy” look. What do you think? \nInside, MY2018 brings two new seat trim colours – Dark Marsala for F-150 Platinum and Navy Pier for the top-of-the-line F-150 Limited. New trim offerings including carbon fibre trim on F-150 XLT Sport and Lariat Sport models, while the F-150 King Ranch features new Kingsville Appointed seats. \nThe light-duty pick-up truck includes some new tech, some of which are new to the class such as adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality that utilises a radar and camera to follow traffic, even until a complete stop. Also segment-first is the available Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection. \nAway from safety, the F-150 can be had with an embedded 4G LTE modem that connects up to 10 mobile devices at one time, and available B&O Play sound system. They join existing segment-exclusive features such as Sync 3 with FordPass, 360-degree cameras, a lane-keeping system and BLIS with trailer tow tech. \nFord says that this is the most advanced F-150 engine lineup ever, with the best ever towing capability. There’s a new standard direct injection NA 3.3L V6 that offers the same 282 hp and 343 Nm as the previous model’s base 3.5L V6. \nThe new second-gen 2.7L EcoBoost engine boasts dual port and direct injection tech, reduced internal friction and improved robustness. Like the 3.5-litre EcoBoost (375 hp and 637 Nm in 2017 spec ), the 2.7L will be paired to a 10-speed automatic transmission for 2018. \nThe top 5.0L V8 gets “significant upgrades” for increased power and torque, although no figures were released. It’s also paired with the 10-speed auto for the first time. Automatic start-stop is standard across the range. \nThe big news is the availability of a diesel engine for the first time in an F-150. The 3.0 litre Power Stroke oil burner is said to be a variation of the proven twin-turbo unit Ford also builds for PSA Peugeot Citroen and Jaguar Land Rover. No figures yet though, and the Power Stroke will only be available in mid 2018. The rest of the range will go on sale later this year, in fall.
