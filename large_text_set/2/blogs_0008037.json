This technique gets a glorious homage from filmmaker Vugar Efendi in The Evolution of Stop-Motion , a video that shows the development of the technique from its first users to the present. \nThe short film lasts three minutes and it is hypnotic in its display of stop-motion from such a range of creative eras. As a technique, stop-motion involves creating the illusion of movement an when object is moved in small increments between photographed frames, and then played back in sequence. \nIt can make dolls dance, household appliances talk, or a toy circus come to life like it did in the film The Humpty Dumpty Circus (1897) the very first use of stop-motion in film. Efendi’s film starts in 1900 with The Enchanted Drawing and runs through the 2016 film Kubo and the Two Strings . The homage is a short stroll through the history of cinema using stop-motion as the comedic and energetic host. See how the technique makes films come to life in the short below: \nIf you want to see more tributes Vugar Efendi, follow him on Vimeo / \nThis article originally appeared on The Creators Project México. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:05:59.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
