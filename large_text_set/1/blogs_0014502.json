The line started out as a 1940's inspired statue line, but their immediate success quickly allowed DC to expand them into other collectible lines and even their own (also successful) ongoing comic. \nNow the popular heroes are invading Funko's POP line, and they are going to be hot collector's items when they hit store shelves. Funko has put together some of it's best sculpts for the line, and the set includes a few notable chase figures that collectors will want to add to their shelves. \nThe initial line includes Batgirl, Wonder Woman, Katana, Harley Quinn, and The Joker, with chase figures for Wonder Woman, Harley, and Joker in the mix as well. The DC Bombshell POPs are hitting store shelves in February of 2017. \nFunko is also launching a new line of Hero Plushies that includes a DC Cinematic Universe inspired Superman, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, and Batman. The plushies are expected to hit sometime in March of 2017. \nHit the next slide to check out the new Funko entries for yourself!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:18:56.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
