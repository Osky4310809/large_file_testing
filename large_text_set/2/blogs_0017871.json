People are getting freckles tattooed on their faces because they’ve lost their goddamn minds. And this isn’t an isolated incident, there are plenty of people getting these stupid ass tattoos.\nI’m dead serious here. There are people spending hard-earned money to have freckles tattooed on their faces. Is this as dumb as prison inmates getting tear drops tattooed underneath their eyeballs after killing someone? You know, I kind of think it is actually as dumb as the tear drop tats:\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\nThis ‘freckle tattoo’ trend was recently featured in Allure and on the UK’s Metro :\nMontreal-based cosmetic tattoo artist Gabrielle Rainbow started freckling after seeing her best friend constantly pumping up her natural dash of summer freckles with makeup, according to an interview with Newbeauty.\nThe process looks something like this: “When they are freshly done, [the freckles] will appear swollen, almost like bee stings,” says Rainbow. “The swelling will go down within a couple hours, and you’ll be left with your cute, fresh freckles. Over the course of one to two months, the color will soften dramatically and look more natural. They will fade naturally with time, and if you wish to keep them, you can always get the color boosted whenever you like.”\nOkay, at least we can blame Canada for this trend and don’t have to own it as our own.\nWhy do I feel so passionately about this being the dumbest trend in history? Well, I was blessed with that Scottish-Irish complexion which starts out as a body completely scattered freckles but when I spend time in the sun I slowly turn into one gigantic freckle. I’m not saying that I’m the King of the Freckles, but I’m at least a high-ranking member of its court. So I find it offensive that anyone would ever spend money to have freckles when they’re nothing but a nuisance to begin with.\n( h/t Metro UK ) \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:30:51.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
