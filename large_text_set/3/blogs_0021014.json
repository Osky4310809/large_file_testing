An adult mollusc can grow up to two inches long. They cling together in ‘reefs’, blocking up pipes. Their stripy shells give them their name They cannot be eaten. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:27:20.998+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
