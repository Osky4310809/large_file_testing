No word yet on what Justin planned in regards to a celebration, but it's possible these two are catching up on some much-needed R&R with a tropical vacation. \nPalm trees swaying in the background, anyone? Photos \nJennifer Aniston Quotes: Love, Marriage & Kids \nBut if Justin's past romantic gestures are any clue, he certainly stirred up an unforgettable day for Jen. Over the Thanksgiving holiday last year, Theroux flew all the way from Germany to surprise his wife and her dinner guests. \n\"My husband, who's been away for almost a year it feels, surprised me on Thanksgiving and came home from Germany. It was really sweet,\" the Office Christmas Party star said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show . \"We had just been together the week prior; I was going to London to do some work. His schedule was apparently 'completely booked' for the week, and he wasn't going to be able to come back.\" \n\"Everyone was just very somber,\" Jennifer explained, referencing Theroux's absence. \"Next thing you know,\" she said, \"turkey walks in and there was another turkey holding that turkey. And that was my hubby.\" \nAnd the husband of the year award goes too... \nHere's to another fabulous year, Jen! We hope today was one for the books.
