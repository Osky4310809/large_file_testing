Because they were all still there when I walked out the door. \n18C? There’s been a committee. It’s made a report. We’ve read the report. No doubt something we’ve brought to the joint party room in due course, I imagine tomorrow. But there’s all of the reports about a massive split. That’s a load of rubbish. I can’t understand how these reports get legs when I was actually in the room and what they say is just wrong. \nI don’t get pursued by people up and down the street by people talking about 18C. Updated 20:49 \nGood morning blogans, \nWelcome to March 21, the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination . I kid you not. The theme this year is “Racial profiling and incitement to hatred, including in the context of migration”: \nEvery person is entitled to human rights without discrimination. The rights to equality and non-discrimination are cornerstones of human rights law. Yet in many parts of the world, discriminatory practices are still widespread, including racial, ethnic, religious and nationality based profiling, and incitement to hatred. \nIn Australia last night, cabinet met to discuss the vexed issue of section 18C (sans 18D) of the Racial Discrimination Act. \nThe Australian , which has been campaigning to change the law, suggests that cabinet favours the Right’s proposal going the Full Monty - that is, remove the words “insult” and “offend”. \nThe Australian has learned that a major sticking point was the ­offence of “humiliate” within the act, which several senior MPs who are backing change argued would be politically difficult to remove. \nThe government is not confirming these reports and any change first has to get through the party room. \nThis is what these two sections say: \nSection 18C: Offensive behaviour because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin \n(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if: \n(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult , humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and \n(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group. \nSection 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith: \n(a) in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; or \n(b) in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest; or \n(c) in making or publishing: \n(i) a fair and accurate report of any event or matter of public interest; or \n(ii) a fair comment on any event or matter of public interest if the comment is an expression of a genuine belief held by the person making the comment. \nKatharine Murphy reported yesterday that Liberal moderates like Russell Broadbent and Craig Laundy are opposed to the change and prefer a process change which would stop vexatious claims earlier. \nThe Coalition party room will meet this morning and we expect a briefing around midday. \nIt is going to be a rocky road today. Keep calm and carry on. Or out the door. Speak to me in the thread, on the Twits @gabriellechan and @mpbowers or on Facebook .
