Robert Bentley, it's easy not to notice when he does something right. \nThe governor, though, deserves great credit for creating a task force - via Executive Order 28, signed Tuesday - to recommend a way to remove state sales tax from \"groceries and essential food products.\" \nIf the task force and then the Legislature can make the arithmetic work, this sales-tax exemption would be a long overdue reform. \nAlabama's biggest cities are burdened by the highest major-municipal sales taxes in the nation, at 10 percent for Birmingham, Montgomery, and Mobile. (Chicago's is 10.25 percent, but exempts groceries, making its effective rate much lower.) Meanwhile, only one other state, Mississippi, taxes basic sustenance without some sort of rebate or credit - and its statewide sales tax is only 7 percent. Alabama's high sales taxes on foodstuffs are both immoral and economically counterproductive (about which, more discussion in a moment). \nUnfortunately, grocery taxes also bring in significant money to a state treasury already, and always, on the edge of serious imbalance. If food is made exempt from sales taxes, most and perhaps all of those state revenues will need to be replaced from some other source. \nThe state Constitution requires that all state sales taxes go to the education budget. Removing the tax from groceries would subtract about $350 million from that $6.3 billion budget, or nearly 6 percent in a state already ranking in the nation's bottom fourth in per-pupil spending and second-last in test scores . Granted, spending levels often don't correlate with education quality, but if results aren't good and funding already is low, it makes no sense to cut spending even more. \nTherefore, the vast bulk of that $350 million should be replaced through other means. In Alabama, that is hard, because most other state taxes are constitutionally required to go not to the education budget, but to the General Fund. Alabama can't just eliminate the grocery taxes and slightly bump up, say, income taxes, to make up the difference in the education fund - at least not without a constitutional amendment. \nAll of which means the new task force's job will be very difficult. \nDifficult - but necessary. \nIt's necessary because the sales tax on groceries falls far more heavily , as much as five times as large a percentage of income, on the working poor and the fixed-income elderly than on the wealthy. Unlike sales taxes for goods related to entertainment, or home-improvement gadgets, or fancy (rather than basic) clothing, grocery purchases aren't \"voluntary.\" Everybody needs food to live, and food takes a much bigger chunk of the working poor's budget. This isn't a matter of demanding that we tax the rich more than the poor, but rather that we stop doing the abominable thing of taxing the poor more than the rich. \n(To be clear, we are talking about saving money for low-income workers, not shirkers: Those using food stamps do not pay sales taxes on those purchases anyway.) \nFor just that reason, 49 states already recognize the immorality of fully taxing basic sustenance. As Thomas Jefferson said (partly literally, partly figuratively), government should \"not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.\" \nTaxing groceries also is economically counterproductive. For people on the edges of the job market, every dollar counts. The more expensive basic sustenance is, the less rewarding it will be to move from welfare to work. Because sales taxes aren't applied to food-stamp purchases, the move from no job to a low-wage job carries with it an effective hike in food prices if groceries are subject to taxation. That disincentive, at least at the margins, adds to the factors dissuading people from leaving the dole and becoming productive, tax-paying wage earners. \nSeveral other considerations, for which space does not permit full discussion here, likewise indicate that taxing food hurts not just the low-wage worker but the longer-term vibrancy of the whole economy. In sum, it's an inefficient tax. Gov. Bentley is right to want to remove it, and his task force merits major public support.
