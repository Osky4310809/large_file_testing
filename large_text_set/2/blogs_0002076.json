Hopefully that comes with perks like dedicated servers (ha) for some games and better infrastructure, but for now, at the very least, we don't have to pay for it. But when we do later in the year (whenever they flip that switch), it'll at least be cheaper than the competition.\nAccording to Dr. Serkan Toto, a Tokyo-based games consultant, Nintendo president Kimishima confirmed to Nikkei that the Switch's online pricing will be around 2,000 to 3,000 yen, which roughly translates to $17-$26 per year. That's around half (if not a little less) than PS+ or Xbox Live Gold.\nDr. Serkan Toto [Twitter]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:40:41.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
