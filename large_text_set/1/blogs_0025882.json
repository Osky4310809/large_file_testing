That adage certainly holds true for Houston. The U.S.’s fourth-largest city will host Super Bowl LI (and Lady Gaga’s dazzling halftime show) this weekend. With robust international influences from a diverse population, the sprawling metropolis offers plenty of diverse neighborhoods to explore, along with exotic cuisines, of-the-moment boutiques, and innovative art offerings. Truly, H-town radiates a supersize mix of high style and downhome charm. Below, a few ideas of things to do should you find yourself in town for game day—or otherwise. \nGreen Spaces, World Class Art, and Live Music \nFor world-class art on a sleepy, bungalow-lined street, the astonishing Menil Collection rotates the private collection of its founders, Houston oil-royalty couple Dominique and John de Menil. The linear, light-filled space, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano is studded with works by Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon, 20th-century European artists like Picasso and Matisse and a behemoth of African artifacts. Just across the street, don’t miss the Cy Twombly Gallery and the moody, octagonal Rothko Chapel , a smattering of 14 works bathed in dark, solemn hues. For continued reflection, the dreamy Isamu Noguchi–designed Cullen Sculpture Garden displays works by Henri Matisse and Auguste Rodin and on Rice University’s campus; artist James Turrell’s pyramid-esque Twilight Epiphany Skyspace is particularly stunning at sunset (procure complimentary reservations online). Later the prestigious Houston Ballet dazzles inside the plush, theatrical Wortham Theater Center. \nThe vibrant 12-acre urban park Discovery Green has something for everyone (art sculptures, playgrounds, an ice rink), while the vast sprawl of Hermann Park Conservatory contains a lovely rose garden. For a peaceful stroll or invigorating run, Buffalo Bayou weaves along the city’s center—past rolling hills and downtown city views (later, sip a glass of afternoon wine under Beauty and the Beast –like chandeliers at The Dunlavy ). When night falls, the small music venue Nightingale Room hosts live music and rotating vinyl DJs while the lofty OKRA Charity Saloon (a nonprofit bar raising money for local charities) slings drinks.

It also thrives on diverse culinary ambition. For coastal Mexican food, Chef Hugo Ortega’s airy seafood-savvy Caracol rivals something you’d find in Mexico City, while the newly-opened Xochi focuses on Oaxacan classics with homemade queso fresco, nixtamal, and earthy moles. For festive diversions, the snazzy taco haven Cuchara brings in mariachi bands and El Real , which is housed in a former cinema, screens old spaghetti Westerns. \nWith a thriving Vietnamese population, Houston is a hotbed of eastern delights. For rice plates and stir-fries, try the no-frills, family-owned Huynh Restaurant , or opt for a heaping bowl of vegan pho at Café TH . In the hyper-local Heights barrio, a craft butcher shop and café at Revival Market serves charcuterie, quinoa burgers, and crispy chicken sandwiches with avocado with an Old World Euro-American tinge. The Italian-flared Coltivare plucks fresh produce (from its own side garden) for craft cocktails and, to eat, offers fresh salads, pasta, and wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas. At dinner, Helen Greek Food and Wine serves gulf shrimp saganaki and a Hellenic wine list while the rustic-chic Tiny Boxwoods is beloved for its outdoor patio. Hop over to Common Bond Bakery for fresh oven breads and snag a table at Local Foods (with a new downtown location) for crunchy, veggie market salads and sandwiches. \nAnd then there’s the fine dining. On Lower Westheimer, James Beard Award–winning chef Chris Shepherd’s new under-one-roof concept of five eateries titled One Fifth Houston debuts with a steakhouse menu. Of course, sushi and sake devotees find refuge at the sexy, dim Uchi . In the glam River Oaks, Chef Ford Fry’s State of Grace affords award-winning people-watching, along with a raw oyster bar and lobster hush puppies. For fine French cuisine, the new Brasserie du Parc hosts a stunning copper bar, antique mirrors, and grand views of Discovery Green. The Pass offers adventurous fine-dining and Provisions serves casual classics like rustic pizzas and vegetables. Speaking of classics, famed Texas barbecue is alive and well at the beloved smoke-shack shrine, Killen’s . Expand Photo: Courtesy of Caracol \nWatering Holes \nThe venerable Anvil Bar & Refuge in Montrose still shakes and stirs some of the best cocktails in town (try the Brave, which mixes Del Maguey mezcal, tequila, and amaro) or opt for the refined Billecart-Salmon Champagne service. A booth at the festive, Mexican-themed Pastry War presents limited-edition tequila bottles and smoky, medicinal mezcal sips. For a touch of Southern sophistication, the grown-up Julep pairs its namesake mint juleps with oysters. In an old gas station, the industrial Eight Row Flint also is beloved for its bourbon and punchy margaritas. Under stringed patio lights, craft-beer enthusiasts frequent The Hay Merchant while a buzzy, post-work crowd gathers at the grand Public Services for wines, whiskeys, and salty bites like smoked cheese and Ritz crackers. Named after Malcolm Lowry’s 1947 novel, the divey Under the Volcano functions as a lively tiki-style bar (think: frozen drinks) with a prized jukebox. Alternatively, rum-laced island drinks are all the rage at the tropical-Polynesian flared Lei Low . For coffee, both Southside Espresso and Boomtown tout all-terrain caffeinated drinks from flat whites to steamy cortados.

To start, the chic Austin-based Kick Pleat stocks labels like Creatures of Comfort, Apiece Apart, and Rachel Comey. The longstanding institution, Tootsies still drapes Houston’s fashionable set in marquee labels. Last year, the posh River Oaks District (think Tom Ford, Dior, Stella McCartney storefronts) opened, bringing with it lux Dallas-based retailer Forty Five Ten where boutique shopping and sipping (either Champagne or coffee) converge. Ann Mashburn , also in River Oaks, has offerings from the designer’s namesake label alongside pieces from Jil Sander, J Brand, and Italian toiletries by Ortigia Sicilia. \nFor homewares, Upper Kirby’s Kuhl-Linscomb is Houston’s answer to ABC Carpet: a string of bungalows stocked with mod furnishings (Knoll, Eames), decorative pieces, and ample, bespoke grooming lines. For designer and vintage wares, Abejas carries Home & Loft Istanbul robes, Péro jackets (hand-beaded in India) and classic Ray Bans. Unearth antique and industrial treasures at Found for the Home or drop by Indulge Decor for soft bed linens (Sferra) and indie-labels like Ulla Johnson. For pampering, The Four Seasons tranquil, refurbished spa cures whatever ails. For callus care, stop by the new minimalist nontoxic nail salon, Paloma with your favorite hue and settle in the serene, Aegean blue Knoll Womb Chairs. Expand Photo: Courtesy of Ann Mashburn \nTo Stay \nDowntown, the aforementioned grande dame returns: The newly renovated Four Seasons features a calming cream-meets-beige palate and in the afternoon, a buzzy bungalow pool scene. Blocks away, the 135-room Hotel Icon sits in neoclassical bank building (est. 1911) and maintains much of its original period touches. The Museum District’s dimly lit Hotel ZaZa features cheeky concept suites and, tucked away from the Galleria’s bustle, the well-traversed Omni Hotel sits on two-acres of rolling greenery. The leafy theme continues inside with a lobby filled with live plants and terrariums.
