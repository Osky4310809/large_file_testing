Feb 28 The elephant in the pro-GMO living room, climate change deniers With all the GMOs being grown for ethanol, why would we be shills for Exxon? I wanted to take a moment and address the elephant in the room, climate change deniers that are pro-GMO. The anti-biotechnology movement loves to bring them up as much as we like to bring up their strong ties with the anti-vaccination movement . Gillam’s organization, US RTK, is actually funded by the anti-vaccination movement It really gets bad when the pro-GMO Heartland Institute creates billboards comparing accepting the science on climate change to the Unabomber. They may be pro-GMO, but they are still science deniers. They are cherry picking science so they can use it as a weapon against NGOs like Greenpeace. Of course Greenpeace does the exact same thing. They accept the science on climate change because it suits their agenda, not because of the actual science. Things get even muddier when people accept the science of climate change, but don’t accept the doomsday predictions of the world ending tomorrow. Keith Kloor is a perfect example. He is 100% in acceptance of the science behind climate change . Yet Polluter Watch tries to insinuate the opposite simply because he doesn’t think we should cut off our supply of fossil fuels overnight. So what makes us different than the anti-biotech crowd? Criticism. Before knowing who or what the Heartland Institute was, I shared one or two articles from them about GMOs. I was slammed by my followers. Comments, PMs, and emails flooded in telling me about the Heartland Institute. But my favorite conversation was between Mike Shellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute and Patrick Moore of Allow Golden Rice Now. Both are extremely pro-GMO and pro-nuclear power. Shellenberger is seen here on Twitter trying to comprehend Moore being pro-CO2 and pro-nuclear at the same time. Shellenberger accepts the science of climate change, Moore does not Compare that to the anti-GMO movement that refuses to criticize the large amount of anti-vaxxers within their ranks. More than likely because many of them receive a lot of funding from anti-vaccine organizations , like the Organic Consumer’s Association and Dr. Joseph Mercola. I find it unfortunate the climate change deniers even open their mouths about it. Often they are pro-vaccine, pro-GMO, and pro-nuclear power. One reason scientists give for the need of GMOs and nuclear power is to help adapt to and mitigate climate change. When I put together a protest outside Greenpeace’s office in DC to question their stance on GMOs I was disappointed to hear some would not join me for fear of being lumped in with Patrick Moore. The Independent Women’s Forum is an example of an organization I want to like. I attended one of their events in DC about the culture of fear, and it was magnificent. They brought together a very politically diverse group of women. Julie Gunlock and Jenny Splitter couldn’t be further apart politically, but when it comes to parenting it would be hard to find better role models. http://www.iwf.org/media/2801808/Release:-Independent-Women's-Forum-Launches-Reasonable-Moms I knew that as a conservative leaning organization that they would probably question the Greenpeace line that “the end of the world is nigh”. But I was disappointed to find them looking to change school curriculum to question the very nature of climate science. Things got so bad that I found myself having to block Julie Kelly on Twitter, also with IWF, after she wrote an article critical of of journalists and scientists defending the consensus on climate change. I had been communicating with her for a year or more about other issues, and did not want to publicly engage on Twitter the way I was tempted to. But what about politicians? Judging by social media, many scientists and science communicators appear to oppose President Trump. Some have raised concerns that any push for deregulation under Trump will only taint GMOs. Even drug companies don’t want Trump to deregulate them , stating concerns over insurance coverage. But politicians are different than NGOs like IWF or even Greenpeace. NGOs don’t work for the people, politicians do. President Trump’s job is to literally serve the people of the United States. I can oppose him on many issues, and still want to work with him for one that I care about. Which is why I was confused by Tim Schwab of Food and Water Watch attacking Mark Lynas for bringing the UK’s Owen Patterson to Cornell University to speak about the safety of genetically modified crops Patterson is a politician, and politicians have to be worked with to get anything done. I would proudly march in DC with Julie Kelly and even Patrick Moore as individuals in support of GMOs, but definitely not under their organization’s banners. I would also proudly march with some of my favorite anti-GMO Twitter “friends” in support of climate change science, as long as nothing said Greenpeace or “ eco-feminism ”. Maybe that is part of the problem. Putting ourselves into groups of “us” vs. “them” limits our ability to work together on common issues. And that, I’m afraid, might be exactly what organizations like Heartland and Greenpeace want most to prevent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:52:13.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
