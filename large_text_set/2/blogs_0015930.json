By Pooja Nayak | Updated: February 21, 2017 10:06 am Amitabh Bachchan's Diwali party was a star studded affair with Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, Ranbir Kapoor and others \nThe political slugfest between Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and PM Narendra Modi is only getting uglier by the day. A day after Modi accused the ruling Samajwadi Party of indulging in discrimination and said if a village gets a graveyard, it should also get a cremation ground, Akhilesh has hit back by referring to Amitabh Bachchan’s Gujarat tourism video promoting the Wild Ass Sanctuary. \nBig B, who is the brand ambassador for Gujarat, has been showcasing the Indian wild ass sanctuary in the Rann of Kutch through a commercial that glorifies ‘donkeys’ Speaking of which, Akhilesh lashed out saying, “Ek gadhe ka vigyapan aata hai, main iss sadi ke sabse bade mahanayak se kahunga ke ab aap Gujarat ke gadhon ka prachar mat kariye (There’s an ad on TV which shows donkeys. I appeal to the century’s biggest star to please stop promoting the donkeys of Gujarat),” Akhilesh said, referring to Amitabh Bachchan while addressing a public meeting in Unchahar (Rae Bareli). Gujarat ke log gadho ke prachar karwa rahe hain, aur hum par aarop laga rahe hain ki hum kewal kabristan aur sirf unke (indirectly referring to the minority community) liye kaam kiya hai,” (People from Gujarat are getting ad campaigns done on donkeys and accusing me of working only for graveyards.” \nRubbing in to clarify his point, the UP CM also read out Amitabh Bachchan’s voice-over in the ad campaign where he invites people to visit the wild ass sanctuary the next time they plan their holidays. “What will happen if donkeys also start getting advertised?” the UP CM asked mockingly. Here, watch the ad campaign that is being mocked by Akhilesh. \nHowever, knowing that this ‘donkey’ remark could unleash a political storm, the Samajwadi Party rushed to defend the CM. SP spokesperson Udayveer Singh said, “The Prime Minister has been saying that UP is number one in loot, rape and crime. The CM has only said that even the donkeys of Gujarat are being glorified.” Now it’s left to see how Amitabh will react to this. Keep watching this space for more updates.
