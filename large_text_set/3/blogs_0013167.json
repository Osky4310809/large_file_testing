While researching my book about her -- \"Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader\" -- I heard stories of how she had won over both David Cameron and Barack Obama by teaching them how to swear in German. She also, apparently, does a pretty accurate impression of the former Pope Benedict, which Putin was said to find particularly amusing. We all caught a glimpse of this more human side of her in 2012 when she broke up G8 talks on Syria to watch the penalty shootout of a Champions League final. But she is also obsessed by detail. The German Chancellor, who has a doctorate in quantum mechanics, is known for her obsessive attention to detail and for her patience. Unlike Trump, who likes to tweet in the small hours of the morning, Merkel often waits days or even weeks before she responds. When a problem emerges, she gathers facts before she makes a decision. By her own admission, she has turned \"cautious deliberation into an art form.\" Indeed, the Germans have even invented a verb for this: Merkeln -- which was the Youth Word of the Year in 2015 in Germany -- means to be indecisive or to not have an opinion on something. But she will not be rushed into anything contrary to Europe's interests and she is certainly not going to be intimidated by Trump's male bravado. In her eleventh year in office, the pastor's daughter who grew up under the communist dictatorship -- and who speaks Russian -- is not likely to welcome President Trump's desire for friendly relations with Putin. Will Europe ride the populist wave? A visual guide Nor is Germany, one of the largest exporters of goods, likely to be enamored by Trump's protectionism. Should he be worried? Should he accommodate his awkward German ally? Or could he simply ignore her? That would not be wise. Much as Trump would like to establish more friendly relations with Moscow, the European Union is one of the US' most important trading partners. Millions of jobs in the US depend on trade with the EU. Upsetting that relationship will make it difficult to bring back jobs to the American Rust Belt -- the area that elected Trump. The 45th President needs to develop a very different style if he is to establish positive relations with Germany. Upsetting Europe's strongest power is simply not an option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T19:08:11.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
