When treated with love and brought up wisely, a beagle has a character that is utterly charming. For the fans of the breed, beagles are practically perfect dogs – not too big, not too small, with no eccentric needs, good-natured, and incredibly fun to have around. And so it is with shock that many of us learn about the terrible fate that many beagles are subjected to. Every year, about 70,000 dogs are being used in research experiments in the U.S. About 96 percent of them are beagles. \nWhy beagles? The breed is being targeted precisely because of the characteristics that people love them for – their natural docility and tendency to trust humans. Those dogs are simply very easy to work with and it’s absolutely heartbreaking that their trust is being taken advantage of in such way. \nFortunately, there are organizations devoted to rescuing dogs from laboratories, like Beagle Freedom Project. Beagle Freedom Project is a Los Angeles-based project founded in 2010. The team negotiates with laboratories all around the world to rescue dogs and other animals that are being used for experiments and give them another chance at having a normal happy life. One of the beagles rescued by the organization is Isaac . He was saved from experiments almost four years ago. The world outside of the cage was overwhelming… The first several months proved to be very difficult for Isaac. He was scared of loud noises, nervous all the time, not sure what would happen to him now. It took a lot to make him understand that nothing as terrible was awaiting him anymore. Once he recovered his trust in people, this beautiful dog gave all his heart to his new family. He is very sweet and affectionate and loves to give and receive attention! Isaac now lives in a house with a big yard where he spends a lot of time playing and exploring. He loves following his new human mom who calls him “the perfect pup.” His family even adopted another rescued beagle – Ernie! \n\nWe hope that as many beagles as possible will find a family and happiness like this thanks to the amazing work of organizations like Beagle Freedom Project. Every dog deserves a chance to have a loving and happy life in a safe place. \nClick here to visit the Beagle Freedom Project’s website and find out what you can do to help the beagles! \nAll image source: Beagle Freedom Project Want to read more posts like this?
