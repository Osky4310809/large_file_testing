(Spoiler: He’d want to mull it over). Rex Tillerson: \"Would need a lot more information\" to make decision on potential Muslim registry https://t.co/OOV03roPPJ pic.twitter.com/17C9wVwiH3 \n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 11, 2017 \nInstead of simply saying “no, registries based on religion are abhorrent and contrary to the founding ethos of the United States,” Tillerson—wrapping his answer in conditionals and theoreticals—signaled an openness to the idea, telling Shaheen “I would need to have a lot more information around how such an approach would even be constructed,” and adding that such a registry would likely extend to “other people as well.” \nLater, during an exchange with New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, Tillerson—seemingly attempting to leave himself some wiggle room should such a registry actually be introduced, as has been suggested by some in Trump’s camp— insisted that he does “not support targeting any particular group.” Tillerson’s semi-push-back contrasted sharply with Trump’s Homeland Security secretary nominee, John Kelly, who explained in no uncertain terms during his hearing that “I don’t think it’s ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor” for tracking, and rejected the creation of such a registry. \nBut Tillerson’s unnervingly chill demeanor wasn’t just limited to the finer points of religion-based population tracking. Ice-Cold Rex was also subjected to a (surprisingly forceful) line of questions from Florida Republican Marco Rubio regarding the deaths of Russian dissidents under Vladimir Putin, to which he first insisted he’d need more information, and finally acknowledged that, hey, shit happens. . @marcorubio : \"Do you believe that Putin & his cronies are responsible for ordering the murder of countless dissidents?\" pic.twitter.com/BzuGBnBTEV \n— David Mack (@davidmackau) January 11, 2017 \n“People who speak up for freedom in regimes that are repressive are often at threat,” Tillerson explained, adding “and these things happen to them.” \nTillerson is expected to be confirmed by the Senate.
