In the latest video for “Legends,” taken from last year’s Coolaid LP, the rap icon reminded fans of his legendary status.\nThe opening of the music video also features a trailer for a Coolaid movie, which is rumoured to be coming soon. Snoop will star in this film based on his life with the latest album serving as the soundtrack.\nThe release comes just a few days after SPINES announced that the brand has partnered with the veteran rapper to present its 2017 spring collection. Despite not being at the forefront of hip-hop as much anymore, it’s good to see Snoop Dogg so active.\nIn other news, take a look inside Daft Punk’s LA pop-up store.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:03:11.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
