I first saw them when I was 16, Iâ€™m now 64. F**k, where did my life go?\" \nOne fan wrote back: \"Your life went right where it was suppose to; creating & enriching a wonderful family, friends, and fans\" \nAnother said: \"Life goes by too f**king fast that's for sure! I'm right there with you Sharon\". \nIt would have been an emotional night for all involved in the band and their followers. \nThe rockers shared a video of their final song, as well as a T-shirt that read: \"Keep calm, Black Sabbath is gone, the end\". \nSharon met Ozzy when she was 18 and her dad, Don Arden, was managing Black Sabbath. \nWhen Ozzy was sacked from the band in 1979, the pair began dating and Sharon started managing him as a solo artist. \nThey tied the knot in 1982 and went on to have three children together, Aimee, Jack and Kelly. \nTheir marriage has certainly had its ups and downs, but they've overcome it all.
