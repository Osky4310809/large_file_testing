According to DJ Koh, Samsung's president of mobile, the incidents were caused by the battery cell and no outlying piece of hardware and software.\nAs reported last week, the batteries built by Samsung SDI had a defect in the top right of the lithium ion cell, and in some cells, caused fire. The batteries from Amperex, the Hong Kong-based facility that built the batteries for the second group of Note 7s, had a defect in the top left portion of the cell that caused short circuits in a small number of units. In addition, Samsung says some of these batteries didn't have the necessary insulation to protect overheating from spreading to the rest of the battery in a short circuit scenario.\n\nThrough the investigation, Samsung worked with a number of independent organizations, including UL, Exponent, and TUV Rheinland, to build an eight-step battery safety check that will be implemented throughout the company's manufacturing processes in the future in order to prevent any such problems from happening again.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7 Galaxy Note 7 fires, recall and cancellation: Everything you need to know Survey results: Samsung users stay loyal after Note 7 recall Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review The latest Galaxy Note 7 news Join the Note 7 discussion in the forums!
