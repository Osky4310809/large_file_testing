It would make America sick again and lead to chaos,” claimed U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate Leader. \nDemocrats accused Republicans of not having a plan to replace Obamacare, leaving Americans in the lurch. \n“They have no replacement plan because they can’t agree,” said U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Leader. \nLou Ann Jeremko, at the Consumer Health Coalition, said working Pennsylvanians without employer health insurance could become uninsured. \n“They’re working individuals or individuals with some sort of income that puts them over the poverty level that would make them eligible for medical assistance.” \nWhat worries consumer health advocates is that the Republican Congress will repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacing it with something that provides health insurance for the one million Pennsylvanians currently covered by it, and without maintaining some other important provisions that benefit all of us. \nThose provisions include coverage for those with pre-existing conditions like cancer, or family insurance for children under 26, or mandated preventive services like mammograms. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \nBut local Republican lawmakers say most of that will not change. \n“It doesn’t mean on the morning of Jan. 21, [the day after President Trump takes office] you no longer have health care,” U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly told KDKA political editor Jon Delano. “Everything is going to stay in place. They’re not going to have the rug yanked out from underneath them.” \nBut there will be changes, says U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus. \n“We’re going to have a different model, one that moves away from Washington mandates to expanded patient and consumer choice,” he said. \nAnd, hopefully, says U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, it will be a bipartisan fix. \n“Let’s work on this together. That’s the way to find solutions. I would think all Americans would hope that we would do that,” he said. \nBut no sign yet that both sides will work together.
