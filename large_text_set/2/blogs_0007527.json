You'll need “a creative nose, a trend-sensitive tongue, and a love of vodka,” according to a statement. \nThe previous sensory master, Per Hermansson, is retiring after four decades with the title. \n“This is one of the most complex jobs in the business—you need ot be equal parts innovator, chemist, teachers, creator, and ambassador,” Hermansson said in a statement. “This person not only needs to have the technical skills needed for the job, but a passion for creativity to keep Absolut on the forefront innovation.” \nThe job promises ample travel—\"around the world\" is mentioned more than once—as well as a good amount of time in Ahus, Sweden, where Absolut got its beginnings. And, of course, the idea of scent is important to this role. \n“Smell is directly connected to the limbic system—our center for wants, desires, and emotions,” according to the statement. “The successful candidate will need to be able ot break through the noise and really pay attention to those unconscious bodily sensations.” \nStill not sure as to what qualifies a sensory expert? There's a quiz for that. Absolut put together a few questions to help you figure out if this is the right gig for you. ( Take it here .)
