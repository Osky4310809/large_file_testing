GET STARTED The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 50th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition Posted March 9, 2017 02:01 PM by Webmaster Kino Lorber have confirmed that they are preparing a brand new 50th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of director Sergio Leone's classic western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), starring Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Aldo Giuffrč, and Luigi Pistilli. The two-disc set will arrive on the market this summer. Synopsis: By far the most ambitious, unflinchingly graphic and stylistically influential western ever mounted, The Good The Bad And The Ugly is an engrossing action shot through with a volatile mix of myth and realism. Clint Eastwood returns as the \"Man With No Name,\" this time teaming with two gunslingers to pursue a cache of $20,000-and letting no one, not even warring factions in a civil war, stand in their way. From sun-drenched panoramas to bold hard close-ups, exceptional camera work captures the beauty and cruelty of the barren landscape and the hardened characters who stride unwaveringly through it. Forging a vibrant and yet detached style of action that had not been seen before, and has never been matched since, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Eastwood style.
