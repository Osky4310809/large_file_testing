Oh but let me tell you – these burgers are absolutely amazing and pack a real punch! They consist of a patty made out of lentils, chickpeas and carrot, and are then topped off with a FIERY black pepper sauce AND a Dijon Mayonnaise. All vegan, of course! Black Pepper Burgers [Vegan] 1 13.66-ounce can of chickpeas, drained 1/2 cup dry red lentils, plus 1 cup of water 1 carrot, grated 2 teaspoons finely chopped Thai basil 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon onion powder Salt and pepper, to taste For the Black Pepper Sauce: 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 1 cup vegetable stock 1 tablespoon sweet dark soy sauce (for color and sweetness) 2 teaspoons regular dark soy 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon spicy Dijon mustard To Serve: Bread rolls, arugula, spinach, and tomato Preparation To Make the Black Pepper Sauce: Using a spice grinder, freshly grind your peppercorns and then transfer it to a bowl. Add vegetable stock, rice milk, sugar, salt, sweet dark soy, regular dark soy, and cornstarch into the bowl. Whisk to combine. Transfer mixture to a small saucepan and add your knob of vegan butter. Whisk over low heat until butter has melted, and then bring to a boil so that the sauce thickens. Once thickened, pour into a bowl and set aside. To Make the Dijon Mayonnaise: Mix mayo and mustard together. Set aside. To Make the Burger Patties: Cook lentils in water until tender. Bring to a boil, and let simmer covered for about 15 minutes. Add more water if necessary. You want your lentils to be a little on the mushy side, to help bind the burger. Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine cooked lentils, chickpeas, carrot, Thai basil, ground coriander, ground cumin, cayenne pepper, chili pepper flakes, onion powder, minced garlic, paprika, chickpea flour, and salt/pepper in a large bowl. Using a potato masher, mash ingredients together well. Leave some chickpeas slightly un-mashed to create texture in the burger patty. You should have a mixture that will form into patties. If it is too wet, add a little more chickpea flour. Form your mixture into 7 patties and place on a non-stick paper lined baking tray. Bake patties for 30 minutes. At this point, you can let them cool and wrap them up individually for freezing or refrigerating. If you’re going to serve them immediately, let them cool for a short while and then sear them in a hot, lightly oiled pan to create a nice crust on the outside. Serve in a warm, toasted split bun and top with rocket, spinach and a tomato slice. Drizze both sauces on and serve.
