Others, such as Netherlands-based Mosa Meat, have used muscle cells from cows to create the world’s first “clean” burger and meatballs. However, Memphis Meats is focused on chicken and duck right now because they're two of the most widely consumed proteins in the world. \nAnimal advocates and scientists say this could have huge ethical and environmental implications. Research suggests that growing food for the world’s increasing population is likely to send greenhouse gas emissions over the safety threshold in the next three decades unless there’s a worldwide push to eat less meat. Then there’s the possibility that the widespread use of antibiotics in meat is contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs . This is also to say nothing of the fact that most of the animals raised in factory farms are treated, frankly, like shit. \nThose in the meat processing industry have also taken note. WSJ reports that last fall, Tyson Foods Inc. launched a venture capital fund to invest in cell-cultured meat growth, and Kevin Myers, the head of product development for Hormel Food Corp. told the WSJ that he thought cultured-meat tech is a “good long-term proposition.” \nAccording to the USDA, U.S. consumers ate an average of 90.9 pounds of chicken apiece last year. While Memphis meats can’t yet produce clean chicken in such large quantities, the company is hoping to begin selling its meat commercially by 2021, so you may see it on your grocery store shelves soon enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:46:18.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
