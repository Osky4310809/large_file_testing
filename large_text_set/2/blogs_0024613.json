That would be breaking embargo. Plus, even if I could review the game now, despite hours and hours of playtime I still honestly feel like I haven’t played enough to deliver a fair and decisive verdict. But for this preview I do have one major takeaway from my sessions so far. I don’t mean this as a quality judgment but as a simple statement of fact. Nintendo has released many huge and important games in the past, but The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is Nintendo’s attempt to put its own spin on the modern AAA video game.\nAll you have to do to realize this is simply look at, on paper, what The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild actually is. This is an open world game with a huge map dotted with villages and enemy outposts. You climb towers to reveal more parts of the map and unlock fast travel points. You use a smartphone-like device to tag important objects. After taming a wild horse you register it at a stable like a car in a garage. Nintendo has namechecked Western influences like Grand Theft Auto and The Witcher , but really none of these systems are too different from what you’d find in any recent Ubisoft game . It’s crazy how close this game is coming out next to Horizon: Zero Dawn , another game very much in this mold.\nBut it’s more than just the genre the makes Breath of the Wild feel like Nintendo trying to offer players what it thinks a “big” game in 2017 should be. With its various loot like weapons and armor, as well as Link’s general frailty, the game makes survival a big part of its exploration. That and frequent goofy, unexpected moments like being struck by lightning, catching your horse on fire, and cooking bad food make the game perfect for streaming. Even with no one else watching it’s fun for multiple people to riff on what’s happening onscreen or makes memes out of captured screenshots.\nMeanwhile, Breath of the Wild’s production values certainly rival today’s biggest games. The Miyazaki-esque melancholy of the beautiful HD visuals maybe even tip the game into AAArtisinal territory. And of course this is the first time a Zelda game has had full voice-acting. None of these things are cheap, which is why we suspect Nintendo is using Breath of the Wild’s upcoming DLC to recoup costs, a very common modern AAA video game tactic.\nHowever, AAA games are nothing inherently special these days. What makes Breath of the Wild such a special game is seeing Nintendo’s essential, irrepressible weirdness shine through what could have just been a fantasy Far Cry clone. It comes out in systems like all-powerful Guardian robot spider enemies that stalk you like BioShock’s Big Daddies throughout the grassy fields. Along with creating intense surprise encounters, they test whether you are ready to be in whatever part of the world you’re heading to without explicitly curtailing the game’s wonderful sense of freedom.\nThe same goes for the stamina system, from Skyward Sword , that lets you scale any mountain and swim any ocean and glide across any valley, but only for a limited time until you get stronger. Better climb that tower fast enough to avoid getting annihilated by a laser beam. Heck, even just managing and upgrading inventory space becomes a game of priorities. like something out of Resident Evil .\nThis is the first Zelda where just messing around aimlessly in the overworld of Hyrule ruins is fun and rewarding in its own right, even after watching a co-worker play through basically the same opening section. It’s as much a lived-in quiet post-apocalypse as it is a playground you poke at for secrets and get ready for it to poke back hard. I haven’t even entered a proper dungeon yet. The exploration mechanics are that engaging and the quirky towns full of personality are that worth hanging out in.\nThe last piece of the puzzle, literally, are the shrines. Shrines are micro-dungeons that offer bite-sized brain teasers like something out of Portal . Most require you to use a rune spell such as freezing water or figuring out how magnets work. Shrines are brilliant for several reasons. They’re clever puzzles. You have to actually think about which tool to use to find the solution. It’s not like finding a hookshot in a dungeon and then obviously using the hookshot to beat the boss. It’s similar to A Link Between Worlds’ praised item rental system but the spells are unlimited.\nShrines also make sure there’s a constant stream of the puzzles that Zelda is known for, even in this new open-world framework that doesn’t lend itself as well to randomly needing to push blocks around or throw bombs. And since Shrines reward you with both fast travel points and orbs that can be traded for health or stamina upgrades, you are encouraged to seek them out and therefore keep exploring the world. They don’t overstay their welcome so you always find time to tackle just one more.\nThere are shades of Final Fantasy XV , but more than anything, Breath of the Wild so far reminds me of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain . I’ve felt this way since E3 . It’s not just because both games let you summon a dog to help as you snipe enemies off of guard towers. And it’s not just because of some story similarities I’ll refrain from mentioning due to spoilers. Both games are the result of old titans of the Japanese video game industry applying their unique game development cultural sensibilities to the new AAA Western open-world game. Just swap Kojima’s weirdness with Nintendo’s weirdness. But beyond being weird, there’s an added sense of craft, a desire to make sure every inch of the world feels like it’s own place worth investigating and not just a block of content, that you don’t get in something like Watch Dogs . It’s a synthesis, not a compromise. MGSV is one of my favorite games of this generation, and I’m very stoked to play more Zelda .\nAgain, I’ll post deeper opinions next week, but in a way The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is much like the Nintendo Switch hardware it launches alongside with, or even the Nintendo mobile apps . The company is finding exciting ways to finally merge its cherished past with the agreed upon video game future.\nWant to learn more?
