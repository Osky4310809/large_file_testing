Some officials say that the start date might have to be pushed back because the state agency that will regulate growers, producers and pot shops won't have the regulations required by state law in place by then. In fact, the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation needs to establish not only how recreational shops are licensed and permitted but also how the multibillion-dollar product is grown, tracked and tested. \n\"It's taking so long to get the draft regulations out there,\" says Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML. \"It wouldn't surprise me if they're late. Furthermore, there's every indication the legislature will pass some more bills altering the regulatory system this year, which could require a mid-stream adjustment that would further push legal sales down the line.\" \nState Sen. Mike McGuire, head of the Senate Governance and Finance Committee, told the Sacramento Bee that delays are probable and that some businesses would open anyway . \"But is it a licensed business?\" he asked. \nYet Alex Traverso, spokesman for the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation, insists recreational sales will start on Jan. 1. He says regulations will be sent to the state Office of Administrative Law in March, after which the public will have 45 days to offer feedback. \"The Jan. 1 deadline is mandated by law, and we have every intention of meeting it,\" he says.
