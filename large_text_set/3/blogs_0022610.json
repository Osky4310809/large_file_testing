Photo: Apple \nThe next major update for iTunes has arrived. \nAlong with unveiling new iPads and iPhones , today Apple released a new software that finally brings cross-device movie rentals to iTunes. \nIn the new iTunes 12.6 update, Apple is introducing a new feature called “Rent once, watch anywhere” that allows iTunes users watch iTunes movie rentals on any device with iOS 10.3 or tvOS 10.2. iTunes movie rentals were inexplicably only available on the device your rented them on until now. Apple did allow users to transfer rented movies to other devices via USB, but the movie was then removed from the library of the device it was transferred from. \nToday’s update makes renting movies pain free. The release notes for the update also indicated that iOS 10.3 and tvOS 10.2 may be released to the public soon as they are required for the new feature to work. \nMac owners should see the update rolling out this afternoon. To download the most recent version, click the “Check for updates” option in the iTunes menu.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:46:27.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
