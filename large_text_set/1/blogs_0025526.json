Penarol will also retain 20 percent of the centre-back's rights and could receive another €5m based on the number of first team appearances he may go on to make. \n\"Barcelona and CA Penarol have reached an agreement for the transfer of Santiago Bueno,\" a statement from the club read on Tuesday . \n\"The player will be a Barca player until June 30, 2019, with the option of three additional seasons. \n\"The Uruguayan defender is currently taking part in the South American Youth Championship with his country. When his participation in the tournament ends, he will join up with the Blaugrana .\" \nBarca are currently pursuing an aggressive strategy when it comes to recruiting young central defenders. \nLast summer they signed France international Samuel Umtiti, while Brazilian Marlon Santos joined the B team on loan until the end of the season. \nThe club maintain an option to sign Marlon permanently -- which they are expected to take up -- after he impressed Luis Enrique enough to earn several call ups to the first team this season. \nColombian centre-back Yerry Mina is also on club's radar and they have an agreement in place to sign him from Palmeiras for €9m in the future. \nMina recently spoke of his \"excitement\" at being targeted by Barca but said that his desire is to remain in Brazil for the next year, where he will have the chance to compete in the Copa Libertadores after helping his side win the Brasileirao . \nSamuel Marsden covers Barcelona for ESPN FC.
