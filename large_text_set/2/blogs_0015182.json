He said that opposition leaders will remain united and focus on unseating the Jubilee administration. He said he is ready to concede defeat during nominations for the opposition flag bearer. By TITUS OTEBA More by this Author \nThe opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa) is optimistic of winning in the forthcoming general elections against Jubilee, Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula has said. \nMr Wetang'ula has said that Nasa leaders have put in place measures that will stop Jubilee leaders from rigging the coming elections. \n\"We can't reveal the measures we have put in place but Kenyans can be rest assured that we (opposition) leaders are going to emerge winners and rule this country,\" said Wetang'ula. \nSpeaking at Tuuti market in Kanduyi Constituency on Sunday, Mr Wetang'ula said that opposition leaders will remain united and focus on unseating the Jubilee administration. \nHe said he is ready to concede defeat during nominations for the opposition flag bearer and will support any leader who will be chosen by the majority as the presidential candidate to face the Jubilee candidate. \nSTRONG OPPOSITION \n\"Those who were thinking that we will disintegrate before the next general elections are shocked that we are emerging very strong day in day out and any leader amongst the four opposition principals will be supported fully to help us beat hands down the ruling coalition,\" said Wetang'ula. \nThe Bungoma senator cautioned the Independent, Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) against working in cahoots with the Jubilee leaders “so as to aid them in poll rigging the way they did with the previous polls body in 2013”. \n\"Let IEBC officers remain independent. They should not be coerced to support a certain coalition. Let them do their professional job that will not attract condemnation from either political divide. We need quality results devoid of any manipulation,\" he said. \nAccompanied by Ford-Kenya Secretary-General and Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu, Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi, Kabuchai MP James Mukwe and a host of aspirants vying on the Ford-Kenya ticket, Mr Wetang'ula accused a local daily of trying to portray Jubilee as having already won the coming elections. \nHe urged the media to inform Kenyans on what is happening in the country and not try to manipulate people's minds to believe that a certain coalition is headed to victory. \n\"We need professional journalism that informs rather than [manipulates] voters’ minds. We are not contented with a certain local daily,\" said Mr Wetang'ula.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:35:07.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
