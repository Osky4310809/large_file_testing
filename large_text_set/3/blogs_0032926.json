I didn’t do it for Playboy .”\nFROM COINAGE: Power Rangers Morphing Through the Years \n“Never do anything you don’t want to do,” adds White. “Listen to your instincts and follow it. It was a great lesson to learn, but what can I say? I did something I shouldn’t have.”\nShe was not fired and went on to wear over 6,500 dresses on the show — “Never the same one twice,” she says.\nWhite says she still doesn’t know the secret to Wheel of Fortune ‘s success, saying, “I still don’t have an answer! I really don’t. It’s just one of those things that every once in a while, everything falls into place… it’s an escape.”\nHer own personal success hit her in a big way, telling Fox News she remembers seeing herself on the cover of a magazine when it hit her.\n“I was on the cover of Newsweek,” she remembers. “That was the moment for me. The other one was when I got my star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. When I first moved to L.A., I went walking down the Hollywood Walk of Fame and I would tell myself, ‘One day I’m going to have my own star.'”\nDespite achieving her dreams, White says she doesn’t see herself retiring soon.\n“I’m sure I will one day,” she says. “But I’m enjoying my job so much. I don’t want to retire. I hope to continue doing it for as long as I can.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T04:09:02.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
