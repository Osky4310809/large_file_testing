I really do think people at Arsenal have given him total trust. He will go down in history as the greatest Arsenal manager and I think he wants to manage for another five or six years by the sounds of it. \n\"I think he is a great manager and he has been fantastic. If you go back from when he started right through to a period of time where now people are complaining they haven't won the championship for a period of time and that just get to a certain stage in Europe. \n\"He is still managing one of great teams in Europe and they could finish in the top four and win the FA Cup. That would be a real tail-off!\" \nThe evolution of Gini Wijnaldum \nOf his battles with Wenger, Pulis added: \"'It is just two competitive people getting on with their lives and having a bit of a scrap here and there. \n\"We will respect them. They are a top, top side â€“ very talented. It is just about making sure you stay with them and stay in the game.\" \nWest Brom are eighth in the table, three places behind Arsenal in the table going into the match, the Gunners having lost three of their last four league matches.
