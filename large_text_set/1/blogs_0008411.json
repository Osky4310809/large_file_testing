Credit: Jordi Vidal/Getty All Stories \nMastodon will hit the road this spring for nearly 30 dates in support of their as-yet-untitled, upcoming seventh album. The tour stars in Missoula, Montana on April 14th and comes to a close a little more than a month later in Austin, Texas. Eagles of Death Metal and Russian Circles will serve as openers. Related Mastodon's Troy Sanders on 'Blind Experiment' of Gone Is Gone LP Bassist/vocalist talks \"different sense of fulfillment\" that side-project supergroup brings, what to expect from main band's new album \n\"We couldn't be more excited to pour majestic rock sauce all over your town,\" Mastodon said in a statement. \"Come on down and help us celebrate the season of new beginnings where fresh buds bloom, animals awaken, the earth comes to life and there's a new Mastodon album to melt your face off!\" \nAccording to the band's drummer-singer-lyricist Brann Dailor, the forthcoming record will focus on the tale of \"a desert-like version of the Grim Reaper.\" The group brought back Brendan O'Brien, who previously worked on 2011's Crack the Skye , to produce. \"Those guys are really excellent players,\" O'Brien told Rolling Stone . \"All three of the guys that sing are excellent singers now. We're able to do a lot more melodically and still keep it aggressive and crazy.\" \nSome of the band's friends and family were diagnosed with cancer, which also influenced the album's overarching theme. \"At the end of the story, the person simultaneously dies and is saved,\" Dailor said. \"It's about going through cancer, going through chemotherapy and all the things associated with that. I didn't want to be literal about it. But it's all in there. You can read between the lines.\" \nMastodon Tour Dates \nApril 14 - Missoula, MT @ Wilma TheaterApril 15 - Seattle, WA @ Paramount TheaterApril 16 - Portland, OR @ Roseland TheaterApril 18 - San Francisco, CA @ The WarfieldApril 20 - Los Angeles, CA @ The PalladiumApril 21 - Phoenix, AZ @ Comerica TheatreApril 23 - Salt Lake City, UT @ ComplexApril 24 - Denver, CO @ FillmoreApril 26 - Kansas City, KS @ Uptown TheaterApril 27 - St. Louis, MO @ PageantApril 28 - Birmingham, AL @ Iron CityApril 29 - Jacksonville, FL @ Welcome to Rockville FestivalApril 30 - Ft.
