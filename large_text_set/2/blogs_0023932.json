But the new look approved this week by city council has been mocked relentlessly on social media for being unimaginative and uninspiring. An open letter circulating among the city’s design community says the wordmark (industry lingo for logo) is an “insult to the design and creative sector” and an “insult to Vancouverites and all who love our city.\n“If the city is not ready to invest in a cohesive new identity with resources and time to do it right, it is better to not redesign at all than to do it half-heartedly,” the letter states.\nFrom a technical standpoint, Neat said he was distracted by the awkward white space around some of the letters, as well as the choice of the — gasp — Gotham font. Popularized by Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, the New York-designed font has faced backlash by some typography geeks for its overuse.\nBut bigger than that was the failure of the new logo to say anything about what values the city stands for, Neat said. Sure, the colour scheme is blue and green, a nod to the natural surroundings, but it could’ve been much more.\nHandout The Australian city of Melbourne's logo has been hailed as inspiring. All the logo says is “we don’t want to offend and we don’t want to say anything,” Neat said. “Personally, as a resident of Vancouver, I think we could be more aspirational.”\nBut Steven Cox, creative director at brand consulting firm Cause+Affect, says simple isn’t always a bad thing. It would be virtually impossible, he said, to come up with a logo that captures the diversity of the city — its natural environment, its tech sector, its ethnic mix.\n“People need to remember, the more complicated the thing you’re trying to symbolize, the simpler the symbol has to be,” he said.\nLogos shouldn’t have to tell a story; they should be thought of as symbols that allow people to create their own stories, he said.\nA city’s visual identity is notoriously difficult to pull off and there are many blog posts and journal articles dissecting “why place brands fail” so often. From Kelowna, B.C., to Adelaide, Australia to the state of Tennessee, logos have come under fire for being too simple or too abstract.\nHandout So cool, some tattoo it on their bodies. But the open letter circulating in Vancouver says many cities have pulled off successful brands, including Amsterdam, Melbourne and Montreal.\n“People tattoo the Montreal logo on their body,” said Denis Suhopoljac, design director at Unbounce, which helps companies create landing pages.\nThe logo is shaped like a flower and each petal forms the letters V and M, the initials for “Ville de Montréal.” And “the intersecting lines at the centre symbolize the city’s vocation as a crossroads of communication and civilization,” according to the city’s website. \nReached by phone Friday, Dean Ponto, co-creative director at Hangar 18, the design agency paid $8,000 to come up with Vancouver’s new logo, declined to comment. The firm was the “lowest bidder” for the project, according to the city.\nCritics were careful to point out that it is possible the firm presented the city with some brilliant designs that were just weeded out by city staff. Inevitably, when your client is a government body, you’re going to go through multiple sets of eyes, Neat said.\n“In compromising, often times we can get to a point where you’ve compromised everything out,” he said.\n“I empathize quite a bit with them.” \n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:56:04.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
