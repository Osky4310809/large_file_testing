Photo: Apple \nApple’s enormous new campus finally has an official name: Apple Park. \nPreviously known as the “spaceship” campus or the minimalist Campus 2, the 175-acre plot will open for business in April, although work won’t officially be completed until late summer. Steve Jobs Theater will seat 1,000 \nIn addition to the two names mentioned above, the new Apple HQ was briefly rumored to be called the Steve Jobs Campus, although the fiercely unsentimental Jobs apparently “ made his views … clear ” that he didn’t want this. \nInstead, the campus’ 1,000-seat auditorium will be named the Steve Jobs Theater as a tribute to the company’s co-founder. “Opening later this year, the entrance to the 1,000-seat auditorium is a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder, 165 feet in diameter, supporting a metallic carbon-fiber roof,” Apple said in a press release .\n“The Steve Jobs Theater is situated atop a hill — one of the highest points within Apple Park — overlooking meadows and the main building,” the company said, observing that Jobs would have turned 62 this month. Apple Park will house 12,000 employees Apple Park’s Steve Jobs Theater is going to be stunning. Photo: Apple \nThe campus will house around 12,000 Apple employees, the equivalent of 35 fully filled Boeing 747s. The building’s strange round design is supposedly intended to create serendipitous interactions between workers. \nAs with all of Apple’s new ventures, Apple Park also boasts impressive environmental credentials — and also an insane attention to detail that reportedly drove builders mad . \nApple employees will be also able to break a sweat in the campus’ snazzy $75 million gym . \nCupertino says Apple Park will include a visitor center with an Apple store and a cafe that will be open to the public. \nWant to get a closer look?
