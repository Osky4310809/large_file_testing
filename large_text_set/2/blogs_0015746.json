Of that total, more than 25 percent were motivated by anti-immigrant sentiments. \nNearly 19 percent of those incidents targeted African Americans, while nearly 10 percent were anti-LGBT and another nine percent targeted Muslims. \n\"We've also seen a steady accumulation of white nationalist flyering reports (at least 85), 78 percent of which occurred on college campuses,\" the SPLC adds, explaining that most of these flyers were passed out by organisations affiliated with the Alternative Right (or Alt-Right), a loosely knit movement of far-right groups that include white nationalists, neo-Nazis and others.
