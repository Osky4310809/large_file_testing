On Monday night, Linkin Park and Kiiara performed their rousing electronic ballad on The Late Late Show . Related Linkin Park Preview New Album With Anthemic Song 'Heavy' Alt-rock outfit teams with rising singer Kiiara for first track off upcoming LP \n\"Heavy\" is a fraught power ballad built around a sparse beat. Linkin Park's Chester Bennington sings: \"I don't like my mind right now, stacking up problems that are so unnecessary.\" Kiiara echoes: \"You say that I'm paranoid, but Iâ€™m pretty sure the world is out to get me.\" \nThe thin instrumental offset Bennington's theatrical vocals and matching stage pyrotechnics. Kiiara, meanwhile, appeared cool and precise, singing the single's second verse. Each singer took turns harmonizing when the other handled lead vocals. \n\"Heavy\" is slated to appear in May on Linkin Park's new One More Light album. The band's last record, The Hunting Party , came out in 2014.
