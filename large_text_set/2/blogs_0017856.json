They are asking President Donald Trump to overturn it. \nFormer Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was also Trump’s vice presidential-elect during much of the period covered by the DHS scans of the Indiana system. \nIndiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson, the incoming president of the association, told TheDCNF Tuesday that, “we know that between November 1 and December 16 we were scanned with about 14,800 scans, nearly 15,000 different times.” \nThe state’s IT team traced the intruder to a DHS computer’s IP address. The same DHS unit attempted 10 times in 2016 to hack into the Georgia electoral system. \nFederal officials are barred under DHS rules from trying to penetrate a state system without the express approval of the state. Neither Georgia nor Indiana approved the DHS scanning attempts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:28:08.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
