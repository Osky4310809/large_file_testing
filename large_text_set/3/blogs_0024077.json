Henderson/Getty Images Adam Wells Featured Columnist March 25, 2017 Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf continues to make her case to keep the Raiders in California, speaking at a rally Saturday to debunk rumors a new stadium proposal has stalled. Via Comcast SportsNet Bay Area , Schaaf told the NFL and the Raiders to focus on \"what we have on the table right now\" regarding a new stadium proposal: \nThere is a story out there, and it is a myth that we are here to dispel. And it goes something like this: People are saying that Oakland's efforts to build a new stadium have been stalled for years. 'Nothing has changed, and therefore the Raiders have no choice but to leave.' We are calling bulls--t on that. Schaaf has been making the rounds lately in a last-ditch effort to keep the Raiders from moving to Las Vegas. She recently sent a letter to the NFL, hoping to convince it the franchise is where it belongs by saying there are 55 acres \"immediately available\" south of the O.co Coliseum for stadium construction. The league reportedly did not receive the letter well, with Vic Tafur of the San Francisco Chronicle noting one NFL executive thought it was an effort for Schaaf \" to save face.\" The NFL's annual league meetings begin Sunday in Phoenix and run through Wednesday, and the Raiders' future home is expected to be a hot topic of discussion. The franchise needs 75 percent approval from the 32 team owners to move to Las Vegas. Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network reported the \"outlook is positive\" the Raiders will get approval to move either at these meetings or in May. Earlier this month, ESPN.com's Paul Gutierrez reported the franchise secured financing from Bank of America to build a $1.9 billion stadium in Las Vegas. The Oakland Raiders were established in 1960 and spent 22 years in the city before moving to Los Angeles for 13 years. They returned to Oakland in 1995, and if the owners give them approval for relocation, they would play the next two seasons in the city before moving to Las Vegas.
