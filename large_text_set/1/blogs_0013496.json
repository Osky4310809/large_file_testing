Few, far between and potentially flawed \nLenovo’s pill-bug phone isn’t the only one to stretch the boundaries of flexible devices. In fact, twistable phone prototypes are something we were seeing as far back as 2011 . Samsung will reportedly release a phone that folds open into a tablet later in 2017, which would take the curved-screen (but static) Edge handsets to the next level, and LG Electronics is rumored to be supplying Apple, Google and Microsoft with flexible phone displays in 2018 . Lenovo, too, is working on a tablet prototype that folds down to make a smaller overall package. The company briefly flashed it to journalists at the same time it showed off the wraparound CPlus. \nBut while research on flexible and foldable phones is heating up in corporate and private labs, don’t expect to see them everywhere at once. Companies tend to go slowly and cautiously with radical new designs. \nNobody remembers Samsung’s Galaxy Round, but it made the S7 Edge possible. Josh Miller/CNET \nTake Samsung’s first curved-screen phone, for example. The Galaxy Round was essentially a concept phone that never left South Korea, but its design morphed through several iterations to arrive at today’s S7 Edge with its two curving sides. Xiaomi’s nearly bezel-less Mi Mix is also another concept device whose technology will show up in other handsets down the line. It’s likely that the first of these futuristic, flexible phones will: Cost a lot to make (and be therefore expensive to buy) Sell in small numbers Sell in one or two test markets to see how early buyers react \nThere’s also wear and tear to consider on phones you repeatedly fold and bend. “[I] don’t see why I’d like my phone to bend and in fact, have put it in an OtterBox to protect it from the daily abuse it has to endure,” said Chris Schmandt, who directs the Living Mobile Group at MIT’s Media Lab. \nIt’s possible, too, that a new, more flexible design could affect the kind of hardware you can put into a device, say, a smaller battery than you can stick in a large, flat rectangle. It’s also likely that rigid parts, like circuit boards, will have to use a different internal configuration, or be made to slightly bend as well. The drive to get there first \nSo if bendable and flexible phones aren’t guaranteed to be a smash hit, why would companies pour cash into R&D for phones that may not go mainstream for years, or even ever? The truth is, we can’t always accurately predict which trends will catch on and which will go thud. \nBut there is a certain glory in innovating first, and there’s a distinct market advantage for companies that have the most experience if and when flexible and bendable gadgets take off. \n(Samsung in particular might benefit here if it’s first to release its foldable electronics . “Samsung will likely take the ‘disruptive’ road back to the market,” said Wayne Lam, an analyst with IHS Markit, “And hopefully put the Note 7 fiasco behind them.”) \nLG’s G Flex 2 actually flexed when you pressed it down, but LG seems to have discontinued the line. Josh P. Miller/CNET \nWhat excites me most, though, is that this type of innovation helps phone makers everywhere build on past discoveries to propel new ones. It is, after all, only through trial and error that the industry collectively figures out what works and what doesn’t. It’s the kind of development that will give us the next tech we can’t live without, the same way that the passion to miniaturize a desktop computer brought about the smartphone tucked into your pocket right now. \nThis article originally appeared on CNET.com . © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..
