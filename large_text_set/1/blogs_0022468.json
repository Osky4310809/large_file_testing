By Ray Fittipaldo / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nIf it looked like the Steelers were taken by surprise at what the New England Patriots were doing on offense Sunday in the AFC championship it’s because they were. Outside linebacker Bud Dupree and cornerback Artie Burns said Monday the Patriots caught the Steelers off guard with how they attacked the Steelers at the beginning of the game. \n“The first drive hit us by surprise,” Dupree said. “They came out firing and they caught us off guard. We were checking and they were checking at the same time. Hats off to that team. They had a great preparation.” \nThe Patriots drove 62 yards in six plays and took a 3-0 lead on the first drive. Brady completed his first five passes on the drive for 12, 41, 5 and 4 yards before a third-down pass fell incomplete. \n\nThe Patriots jumped out to a 10-0 lead when they scored a touchdown on their third drive and had 17 by halftime. \nDupree said the Steelers had prepared for the Patriots to operate out of the no huddle, but they were taken aback by the frequency with which Brady ran it. \n“We didn’t really anticipate it like that,” Dupree said. “It was more in their approach to the no huddle, the checks they made right away. It was a great job by Tom Brady.” \nBurns said the Steelers were not expecting Patriots receiver Chris Hogan to be the main offensive weapon for Brady. \n“We knew he was one of the guys who could stretch you,” Burns said. “That’s why we played a lot of zone, to keep the top on the coverage. He was able to slip behind it. That’s why he had the game he had by slipping behind our deep coverage to make plays.” \nRush thwarted \nDupree said he and James Harrison dropped into coverage more than they rushed against the Patriots. He said the game plan was for Ryan Shazier and Lawrence Timmons to rush up the middle to take advantage of the Patriots’ weakness on the interior of their offensive line. \nHowever, the Patriots countered by sliding their protection and they were able to pick up the rushes from the inside linebackers with relative ease. \n“We were trying to attack the middle and trying to win one-on-ones, but we just couldn’t get off,” Dupree said. “It would have worked, but we couldn’t stop them on third down to get into the situation we really wanted to get in.” \nInjured defensive end Cam Heyward watched helplessly as the pressure the Steelers dialed up failed to get to Brady. \n“I just think we could have gotten off on third down, especially early on,” Heyward said. “They out-executed us a little bit. I thought we held up really well against the run. We needed to get more stops and got the ball to our offense more. We needed to get more pressure. It was a little bit inconsistent. They did some things and they converted, and you tip your hat to them.” \nOn the mend \nInside linebacker Vince Williams said he will have shoulder surgery and is expected to be in a sling for 10 weeks afterward. Williams played the past two playoff games with the injury. \nReceiver Sammie Coates said more surgery for his fingers could be in store. He is meeting with team doctors in the next couple of days and will find out more after meeting with them. Coates injured his fingers in a victory against the Jets in September and played with the fingers splinted for the remainder of the season. \n“Surgery is always an option,” Coates said. “We’re going to see how it goes. I have to see the doctor this week and I’ll see what they say.” \nOffensive lineman Ryan Harris said he rehab from a hematoma on his leg is going well. He was injured in early October and team doctors told him at that time a return might be possible during the season, but the Steelers placed Harris on injured reserve to free up a roster spot. \nHeyward said his rehab from a pectoral injury is going well. He’s not sure if he’ll be ready for OTAs and minicamp this spring, but he is definitely expected to be ready for the start of training camp. \n“I’ve progressed pretty well,” Heyward said. “I’m ahead of schedule on a lot of things. Hopefully, I can keep doing that.” \nRay Fittipaldo: rfittipaldo@post-gazette.com and Twitter @rayfitt1.
