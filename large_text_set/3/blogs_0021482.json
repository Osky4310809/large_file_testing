This 18-year-old named Lee De Paauw drank 10 cups of “goon” (boxed wine) and then hurled his body into a crocodile infested river. He was hoping to impress a cute, British backpacker named Sophie, but the croc stole his thunder. 2 \nThey walked along the Johnstone River in Innisfail that is well-known crocodile area. He told Sophie in what I’m sure was a drunken slur, that crocodiles don’t attack Australians, only backpackers. He jumped off a jetty and was almost immediately snatched by a crocodile. The croc bit his left arm, but that didn’t stop Lee from fighting back. He told an Australian news station that the first punch got the croc in the snout and the second landed on his eye and then it finally let him go. \nHe was able to swim back to shore and had so much adrenaline pumping he didn’t feel the pain until he was walking along the main road. 3 \nThe plot twist is Sophie was not impressed by his “heroic” stunt. Shocking. She explained, “You’ve seen Jaws you know what it’s like. There was a lot of blood, a lot of bone. It was pretty horrendous.” \nTragically this story will not have a romantic ending because “Being attacked by animals doesn’t really do it for her.” Hey at least he gets to keep his arm. 4 \nPeople on Twitter think this kid is a moron for voluntarily jumping in with the crocs, but Lee stands by his drunken choice. He has no regrets about his extreme attempt at impressing his crush. He might be the stupidest guy around, but he begs to differ because he was “just trying to prove a point.” 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T20:09:48.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
