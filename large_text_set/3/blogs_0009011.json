The number of F8000’s sold is not known. \nAccording to the documents published by WikiLeaks, audio could be obtained even when the TV appeared to be off, using a ‘Fake-Off’ mechanism that took control of the LED light. \nIt is not clear from the leak whether the audio was streamed or downloaded. In a section titled ‘ToDo / Future Work’ the document discusses plans to stream audio from the TVs. \nVideo capture is also listed as planned for future development in the documents. \nREAD MORE: Apple, Samsung, Microsoft: WikiLeaks blows lid on scale of CIA’s hacking arsenal \nThe document revealed that the CIA and MI5 developed the ability to extract browser and WPA/Wi-Fi credentials and history, with plans to develop a ‘Fake-Off’ mechanism for WiFi, enabling them to transfer data even when WiFi appears to be off. \nThe tools were named ‘Weeping Angel’ after predatory creatures from the British sci-fi series ‘Doctor Who’ which take on the form of stone statues before attacking their prey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T14:11:07.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
