Bang!’s Paul Rust and Community -alum Gillian Jacob, Love explores a problematic romance between straight up nice guy Gus and the self-destructing Mickey. As you can probably gauge from the sex, cocaine and magic mushrooms in the teaser above, this isn’t your usual gooey love story.\nIn this chapter, it looks as if the flawed pair will continue to try and make their relationship work — even if that means Gus getting tied up in some unfortunate situations. Here, the character can not only be seen getting wavy and powdering his nose, but also getting into trouble with the law. For Mickey, it appears old habits die hard.\nThe second season will run for 12 episodes and debut on March 10. Fans will be delighted to know Love has already been renewed for a third season.\nOnce you’ve finished watching, be sure to check out our 5 best Valentine’s Day movies.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:31:14.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
