That sure does sound familiar!\nWith still-lingering rumors about a potential offshoot of Pokémon Sun and Moon known as Stars coming to Nintendo Switch, it's tempting to want to connect these dots and be on our merry way.\nOne of the job openings calls for an artist experienced with working on Wii U and PlayStation Vita character models, and another involves animating and modeling, as well as assisting programmers with data work.
