Like the original, this series will examine the oceans and all of the weird and crazy shit that happens in the briny deep, with a press release specifically highlighting methane volcanos in the Gulf Of Mexico, the “Boiling Sea” phenomenon, and interesting creatures like “hairy-chested Hoff crabs,” “snub fin dolphins that spit water through the air,” and “Pacific leaping blennies” (which have been photographed for the first time as part of Blue Planet II ). The series also sent a pair of manned submersibles deep into Antarctic waters “for the very first time,” so there should be plenty of new stuff for people who feel like the first Blue Planet alreadytaught them everything they need to know about the oceans. \nA premiere date for Blue Planet II has not been announced, but BBC America has confirmed that David Attenborough will once again be narrating the series. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:21:47.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
