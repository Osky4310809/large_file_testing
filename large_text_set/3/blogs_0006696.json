Also Read: 'My Cousin Vinny' 25th Anniversary: Behind the Scene That Won Marisa Tomei Her Oscar \nIf you’re already as confused as Judge Haller was in the movie, let’s back up. Near the end of the film, defense lawyer Vinny Gambini (Pesci) is questioning his fiancée (Tomei) on the stand. He shows her an evidence photo of tire tracks, and she goes on to explain to the judge and jury that the car driven by the defense could not be the one that made the tracks shown in the photo. Here’s a chunk of Lisa’s testimony from the movie: \n“When the left tire mark goes up on the curb and the right tire mark stays flat and even? Well, the ’64 Skylark had a solid rear axle, so when the left tire would go up on the curb, the right tire would tilt out and ride along its edge. But that didn’t happen here. The tire mark stayed flat and even. This car had an independent rear suspension. Now, in the ’60s, there were only two other cars made in America that had positraction, and independent rear suspension, and enough power to make these marks. One was the Corvette, which could never be confused with the Buick Skylark. The other had the same body length, height, width, weight, wheel base, and wheel track as the ’64 Skylark, and that was the 1963 Pontiac Tempest.” \nBut wait! There was a third car that could’ve made those marks! According to Launer, the third car was the Chevy Corvair.

Oddly enough, I had not seen him since high school, and I saw him at the premiere. He said [ laughs ], ‘You know, there were actually three cars with independent rear suspension.'” \nLauner said all of Lisa’s automotive expertise came straight from his own head. \n“There was no research whatsoever. That’s what I would call misspent youth,” he said, explaining, “When I was in high school, there was a time I could give you the weight, engine displacement, horsepower options and suspension description of every car sold in America.” \nThere you have it. Case closed. 'Wayne's World' 25th Anniversary: 12 Things You Probably Didn't Know (Photos) \nMike Myers and Dana Carvey turned their hit \"SNL\" sketch \"Wayne's World\" into one of the 1990s quintessential cult films. It opened in theaters on Valentine's Day 25 years ago. And though critics grumbled about it, it wowed audiences with its ridiculous number of gags. Directed by \"Decline of Western Civilization\" mastermind Penelope Spheeris, it remains one of the great send-ups of slacker culture and corporate media. In celebration of it, IMDb and TheWrap have gathered 12 facts about the comedy you probably didn't know. Paramount \nIt's not uncommon for shows and movies involving teens to use actors in their twenties and thirties as the lead characters, and \"Wayne's World\" was no exception. At the time of filming, Myers was 28 and Carvey was 36. Paramount \nMyers said that he was convinced that \"Wayne's World\" was never going to make it through production, and credited the film's producer, \"SNL\" creator Lorne Michaels, with pushing the project past skeptical Paramount execs ( via Yahoo ). Myers noted that the first notes back from Paramount on his script for the film were: \"I don't get it.\" Getty \nThe scene where Garth asks Wayne if he was ever turned on by Bugs Bunny dressed in drag was actually based on an ad-libbed conversation Carvey and Myers had while waiting for a plane to fly by so they could start filming. Myers loved the joke so much he asked Carvey to use it again when the cameras were rolling. Paramount \nAfter filming wrapped, Carvey suffered from severe jaw pain after emulating Garth's overbite. He had to hold bags of ice to his jaw for several days after shooting ended. Getty \nIn 2014, Myers directed a documentary about Shep Gordon, a famous Hollywood agent who managed the careers of stars like Emeril Lagasse, Pink Floyd, Blondie, and Alice Cooper. The documentary traces its roots back to \"Wayne's World,\" when Myers and Gordon first met while working on the film with Cooper. Getty \nBack in the '90s, Dennis Hopper was one of the most popular actors in Hollywood when it came to playing villains, and Spheeris wanted to cast him as the father figure to Wayne's nemesis and scumbag TV producer, Benjamin Oliver (Rob Lowe). Unfortunately, budget constraints prevented the hire, so Hopper's character got merged into the Benjamin role. Getty \nThe famous \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" lip-synch scene was based on Myers' childhood memories of singing along to the song in the car. According to Rolling Stone, Michaels and Spheeris wanted to use a Guns N' Roses song as that band was more contemporary, but Myers threatened to walk off set if he didn't get his way. Paramount \nIt took four hours to complete the Bohemian Rhapsody scene, and Myers was complaining of whiplash and neck strain from headbanging so much, according to an interview by Spheeris in Entertainment Weekly . Getty \nBut that famous scene was just one of many moments where Myers and Spheeris locked horns over the direction of the movie. Eventually, the two severed ties with each other after Spheeris and Myers were bitterly split on Spheeris' final cut of the film. Spheeris blamed Myers for blocking her from returning to direct the sequel. The two eventually reconciled at a cast reunion in 2013. \nOne scene that was put in by Spheeris that Myers thought would fall flat was Robert Patrick's cameo as a police officer that looks exactly like the T-1000 that Patrick played in \"Terminator 2.\" Myers thought that the reference wouldn't work, but it ended up getting the biggest laughs during test screenings. Paramount \nAnother song that \"Wayne's World\" used as a gag was \" Stairway to Heaven ,\" but the royalties were far too costly for the film's $20 million budget. As a result, Myers had to make the gag work while only using five notes from the song. And he succeeded. Paramount \n\"Wayne's World\" turned \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" into a hit again, 17 years after it was released. Queen guitarist Brian May showed the film to Freddie Mercury three months before he died of HIV-AIDS, and Mercury reportedly loved the scene. \n\nCheck out IMDb for even more \"Wayne's World\" trivia.
