If we learned anything at all from today's morose testimony by James Comey it is that he's unwilling to confirm investigations were underway, or even considered, to reveal the leakers that keep disseminating sensitive information to the press. Bear in mind, this is a felony punishable up to 10 years in ape raping prison, yet no one seems the least bit interested in who was committing them. \nWe can hardly conclude that Comey is a democratic shill, considering he was instrumental in making Hillbot look like a literal prisoner one week before the elections -- with the announcement of his pointless investigation which he later redacted. What sort of game is Comey playing anyway? He confirms Russian investigation but will not confirm investigation into felonious leaks? pic.twitter.com/vbQQsM2nms \nNewt weighed in on the matter which he described as 'idiotic' -- confounded at the juxtaposition of Comey freely admitting to investing Russian phantoms, but unwilling to even say he might look into the leaks. \nPray tell me, why? \nWhat sort of game is Comey playing anyway? As far as I can tell, he's a bull in a China shop just making a mess and a lot of noise -- but doing nothing other than that. Lots of accusations are flying on both ends, but nothing is ever revealed or concluded. He's probably the most universally hated man in America, from both sides of the aisle, yet there he is shilling away. \nHow can anyone believe a word coming out of this man's mouth?
