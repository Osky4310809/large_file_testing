No action was taken. That means this bill is now expired and rotting like old milk in the fridge — but these are Iowa Republicans. You know they’ll try to dismantle science education the next chance they get. All the more reason to keep watching them and push back when necessary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T05:25:54.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
