Vice President Joe Biden, in his role as President of the Senate, presided over a joint session of congress to certify the vote. Rather than acknowledge the clear results of the election, something Democrats thought was very important before Trump won, Democrats took the opportunity to raise a series of objections. From NPR :\nMore than half a dozen members rose at different points to object to the results of the election, citing Russian hacking, the legitimacy of the election and electors, voting machines, voter suppression and more.\nAs each Democrat rose to object to the certification of the vote, Biden stated the requirements, i.e. an objection must be in writing and must be signed by both a member of the house and a senator. The objections were all in writing but none had been signed by a senator, so Biden repeatedly cut the Democrats off with a bang of his gavel. CNN reports Biden told Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, “There is no debate. There is no debate. There is no debate.”\nFinally, when Rep. Pramila Jayapal rose to object to the certification of the vote in Georgia, Biden briskly cut her off with his gavel. “There is no debate,” he said. Biden then repeated the requirements for an objection to the certification and asked, “Is the objection in writing and not only signed by the member but by a United States Senator?” Rep. Jayapal replied, “Mr. President even as people waited hours…” Biden slammed the gavel and again repeated, “There is no debate.” Biden added, “If it is not signed by a senator the objection can not be entertained.” This time Rep. Jayapal said, “Mr. President the objection is signed by a member of the House but not yet by a member of the Senate.”\n“It is over,” Biden replied. The quip brought a laugh from House Speaker Paul Ryan and a standing ovation from Republicans in the chamber.\nBiden really does seem to have offered the perfect response to the last two months of Democratic efforts to undo the results of the election.
