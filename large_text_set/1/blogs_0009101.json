The pair seemed happy during the duration of their meal and Carter noted no problems while serving them. \nIt's only when the waitress looked at the $30.52 bill that she realized she had been a victim of racism. \nAs you can see (below), the racist couple left no tip and defended themselves by writing that they \"don't tip black people\". The gross pair even went as far to commend Kelly for her \"great service\", which is especially cruel considering. \nTake a look at the offensive receipt (below): \nIn a comment to NBC Washington , Ms. Carter expressed her shock, explaining: \n\"I looked at the receipt three times.\" \nSo awful. \nVideo: Fox News Airs Shockingly Racist Chinatown Segment! \nFollowing the upsetting news, Anita's president Thomas Tellez revealed his outrage over the incident, telling the outlet: \n\"It's disheartening; I'm outraged. I was appalled, though it's kind of in line with the political landscape, unfortunately.\" \nDespite Kelly's hurt and pain over the incident, she's not going to let the unfortunate situation get her down. In fact, the server claims she'd wait on the couple if they visit the establishment again. \nCarter explained: \n\"I keep my head up. I have to keep moving. One hateful remark can not stop me. My arms are still opened to him. That's him, not me.\" \nWow, what a class act! We're truly humbled by Kelly's sense of compassion and dignity. \nP.S. You can watch Kelly's full interview on the situation (below): \nSo, would YOU serve the couple again if you were in Kelly's shoes?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T02:01:17.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
