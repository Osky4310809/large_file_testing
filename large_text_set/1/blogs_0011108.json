Scarecrow Sprinklers are safe for people and pets. Versatility: no need to take separate control measures against each of the various types of pests. Scarecrow Sprinklers are humane: pests are simply driven off, uninjured. \nCons Scarecrow Sprinklers may get you wet if you're not careful! \nDescription I had trouble at first with a leak where the stake meets the hose.... \ncontinue reading below our video How to Position Lawn Sprinklers But just keep at it: you'll get a good, tight fit eventually. When a pest gets within range (35 ft.), Scarecrow Sprinklers begin moving in an arc... and spray out a 3-second, pulsating stream of water. It's the combination of the movement, the noise and the water itself that scares off pests. Scarecrow Sprinklers will continue to shoot out water at 7-second intervals until the pest leaves. Uses a 9-volt battery (sold separately). \nGuide Review - Scarecrow Sprinklers \nThe principle behind Scarecrow Sprinklers is simple enough. A motion sensor lurks within the \"crow's head\" sensor housing. Just as with motion-activated lights, anything that crosses the sensor's path activates the device -- except that, instead of a beam of light, a stream of water shoots out upon activation. The stream of water is directed at the pest, scaring it off. \nA sprinkler head sits atop the sensor housing, which, in turn, sits atop a stake and a stake extension. The stake is jammed into the ground. The stake extension is hollow and forms a \"T.\" To one end of the T's crosspiece, hook up a garden hose. The other end is sealed with a flow through cap, unless you wish to attach a second hose (for watering) or wish to install multiple Scarecrow Sprinklers. The fact that you can attach a second hose thusly meets an obvious objection some might raise concerning the Scarecrow Sprinkler upon first hearing about it: namely, that while it's running, you'd be unable to water your plants. \nRegulation of Scarecrow Sprinklers occurs on 3 levels. Firstly, the directions indicate the water pressure you should use. Secondly, adjust the arc of the spray coming from the sprinkler. This is done by changing the position of stem tabs on the sprinkler unit. Finally, there's a knob on the sensor housing that determines the sensor's sensitivity. On all 3 levels, regulation is fairly intuitive and just requires a bit of practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:31:02.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
