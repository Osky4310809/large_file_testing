Unzue is a superb professional. A fantastic person. \n\"We are very happy with his work. We are delighted that he is working the way he is doing. \nIniesta: I didn't want to join Barca \n\"When the season is over, and it has been said by several club spokespersons, the coach will be announced. The club always works, constantly. \n\"Also in sports planning. But the most important thing is what we have on the table. And we are alive in the League, in the Champions League and in the Copa del Rey.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T11:59:20.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
