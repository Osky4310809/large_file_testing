Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLabour peers have vowed to rewrite Theresa May ’s Brexit Bill and said they will not be “cowed” by threats to abolish the House of Lords if they succeed. \nLabour Lords leader Baroness Smith has tabled eight amendments to the Brexit Bill which was passed by the House of Commons on Wednesday night. \nThe amendments largely ape those which Labour MPs tried and failed to secure in the Commons during the Bill’s stormy passage this week. \nThey include guaranteeing rights for EU nationals currently living in Britain, and forcing Ministers to give quarterly updates to Parliament on how the Brexit talks are progressing. \nThe Bill will be debated in the Lords later this month and Tory Government sources have hinted the chamber could be abolished if it tries to “frustrate” the new Article 50 law.

The stakes are too high and we will do our duty.” \nTheresa May was forced to distance herself from the threats, which were texted to journalists by a prominent Government figure following the Brexit vote in the Commons on Wednesday night. \nThe PM’s spokesman said the source’s comments were “not the view of the Government”. \n“We fully respect the very important role the House of Lords plays,” the spokesman added. \n“There’s an important role to play in scrutinising and debating legislation and it will now proceed with that.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:07:22.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
