[6] He and his crew currently occupy Wano Country . [4] \nHe was first referred to by Monkey D. Garp in Water 7 and then directly mentioned by Gekko Moriah shortly after he obtained Monkey D. Luffy 's shadow ; [10] his title of Yonko was revealed just after the Straw Hat Pirates defeated Moriah. [9] Contents Appearance Kaido's eyes seen in full detail. \nKaido is an abnormally large, extremely muscular man, appearing at least six times the height of Eustass Kid , who stands at 205 cm (6'9\"). He has a comparatively small face, [1] with yellow bloodshot eyes underneath small eyebrows (similar to those of an Oni ), [11] a hooked nose, a long chin, often with thick veins on his forehead, pronounced lines around his nose stemming from his angry sneering, and extremely pronounced crow's feet below his lower eyelid creases. [12] He has very long, thick, swept-back black hair that resembles a mane, a wavy, waist-length fu-manchu mustache , and a spiky goatee along with a pair of long, thick, light horns curved forward on each side of his head. On his right abdomen, he sports a large, cross-shaped scar, and on the left side he has a black and gold tattoo resembling reptilian scales, going from his chest down the front of his left arm to end with a white skull at the lower forearm. [1] \nKaido wears a dark blue feather coat draped on his shoulders, below which is a plain, light-colored, long-sleeved, close-fitting, and open shirt [13] held together by a light rope belt, a shimenawa , below which hang various light tapes, ribbons, and two thick chains attached each to a separate fabric piece on each side. Below that, he wears unspecified dark pants, and slightly above his wrists are spiked bracelets. [1] Personality \nKaido is a merciless and confident warrior who never misses an opportunity to gain an advantage in war, as evidenced by his plan to attack Whitebeard during the latter's attempt to save Portgas D. Ace from execution. [14] He apparently craves excitement, as he is prepared to start the largest war in the world because he felt it was too mundane. [15] This recklessness, coupled with his apparent inability to die, has caused Kaido to make attempting suicide his hobby. [16] \nHe is also pitiless and not open to negotiations or excuses, making it unwise to provoke or underestimate him; this is enforced dramatically when Donquixote Doflamingo , a former Shichibukai and former World Noble known for his fearless attitude, was very afraid of angering Kaido when he became potentially unable to fulfill his end of their business deal due to Trafalgar D. Water Law holding Caesar Clown hostage. [17] One of his crewmates later stated that Kaido would be very angry once he heard the news of the SMILE Factory 's destruction. [18] \nKaido is highly confident in his power and considers himself to be far above the likes of Supernovas, referring to their actions as \"little pirate games\", even refusing to take the Straw Hat Pirates and Heart Pirates seriously despite them crippling his SMILE trade; [19] this is reinforced by his belief that defeating a Shichibukai is nothing to be impressed with and his dismissal of Donquixote Doflamingo as being weak. [20] A drunken Kaido drowns his sorrows. \nKaido is a very heavy drinker and, while drunk, his mood changes erratically, such as when he quickly went from being melancholic over his inability to increase the number of his Gifters and fulfill his dream of having a crew consisting of only Devil Fruit users to becoming angry and violent, beating his subordinates and cursing Luffy and Law. [21] \nLike other people, Kaido has a unique laughing style : \"Worororo\". [22] Relationships Crew \nKaido cares somewhat for his subordinates, as Scotch confirmed that Kaido would be angry if he were to be attacked. [23] His subordinates seem to respect him, as Scotch refers to him as \"Kaido-sama\" [24] while Sheepshead calls him as \"His Majesty\". [25] However, Kaido acts callously toward his subordinates when in an angry mood, having once sent his subordinates flying out of his fortress with brute force while smashing wanted posters of his enemies. [26] Prior to his supply of SMILEs being cut off, Kaido's dream was to have a crew composed entirely of Devil Fruit users, which he wanted to be the best crew the world had ever seen. [27] Jack \nJack is one of Kaido's three right-hand men, implying that the Yonko has great trust in him and his power. [28] However, when learning about Jack's failure to rescue Doflamingo, Kaido appeared to care more about the loss of his SMILEs than the loss of his subordinate. [29] Allies X Drake \nPrior to the timeskip, X Drake seemed to be interested in meeting Kaido, having willingly provoked his subordinate Scotch on the Yonko's favorite winter island in order to gain his attention. [30] He is now apparently subservient to Kaido, being stationed with his subordinates. [31] His allegiance with Kaido was first shown when he squashed a rebellion perpetrated against Kaido's subordinates on the same winter island. [32] Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown \nKaido is a black market customer of Donquixote Doflamingo . [33] Caesar Clown produces and delivers large amounts of the substance SAD to Doflamingo, who uses it to manufacture artificial Devil Fruits called SMILES , which in turn are sold to Kaido to create his army of Artificial Zoan Devil Fruit users. [34] Despite this, they do not seem to be on friendly terms, as Law asserted that Kaido would slaughter Doflamingo if he were to be rendered unable to supply Kaido with Zoan fruits anymore; Doflamingo himself displayed great fear at the thought of angering Kaido. [17] \nHowever, Kaido does not appear to resent Doflamingo despite his defeat, as he felt sympathetic for Doflamingo not being powerful enough to defeat Luffy and Law; however, this may have been a result of Kaido being drunk at the time. [35] Scratchmen Apoo \nKaido encountered Scratchmen Apoo along with fellow alliance members Eustass Kid and Basil Hawkins when he fell onto their base after jumping from Ballon Terminal . [1] While what happened during their confrontation is unknown, Apoo now appears to be allied or, at the very least, a subordinate to Kaido, as he contacted him to reveal that they had lost contact with Jack. During the conversation, Apoo referred to the Yonko as \"Lord Kaido\". [36] Shogun of Wano Country \nKaido formed an alliance with the Shogun of Wano Country and executed the daimiyo Kozuki Oden . Enemies Gekko Moriah \nKaido once had a rivalry with the former Shichibukai Gekko Moriah . The two of them fought in the New World, and eventually Kaido won after slaughtering Moriah's entire crew. This had an adverse effect on Moriah's perception of subordinates and led him to seek revenge against Kaido by building an army of undead soldiers . [37] [9] Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance \nTrafalgar Law sought out an alliance with Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates allegedly in order to dethrone Kaido; Luffy agreed to the alliance and even declared that he would defeat all four Yonko. [38] Though Law suggested that their chances of success are only 30%, Luffy remained undeterred. [39] \nHowever, it is later revealed by Law himself that he formed an alliance with Luffy not as a means to dethrone Kaido, but instead because he wanted to get Kaido angry at Doflamingo by having the Straw Hats destroy the SMILE Factory . [40] Law also notes that if they kill Doflamingo and destroy the factory, Kaido will transfer his grudge to the pirate alliance. [41] \nKaido knew of the two crews before he heard what they had done to him, and when he heard about them destroying his source of SMILE, he wept and cursed them. However, he still does not take them seriously, viewing himself as far stronger than they are. [42] Eustass Kid \nKaido defeated Kid during their encounter at Kid's base and threw him in a jail cell. Later, Kaido used Kid as an example when illustrating the difference in power between him and the Supernovas . [43] Kozuki Family \nKaido became the sworn enemy of the Kozuki Family after he executed Kozuki Oden and his wife. To learn the secret that Oden knew, he hunted down Oden's son and his retainers Kin'emon , Kanjuro , and Raizo . He entrusted his right-hand man, Jack, to search for Raizo at Zou. Kaido believed that Oden was a foolish lord. Yonko Edward Newgate \nAs they were both Yonko, Kaido and Edward Newgate were not allies. Under normal circumstances, they did not provoke each other; however, Kaido saw the opportunity to engage his rival prior to the impending Battle of Marineford and did not hesitate to attempt to do so. [14] Two years later, Kaido cursed Whitebeard for being able to die while he remained alive. [44] Shanks \nWhen Kaido tried to stop Whitebeard from going to Marineford , Shanks interfered and clashed with him in order to allow the other Yonko to rescue Ace. [14] It is not known what happened during their encounter, but Shanks arrived at Marineford unharmed. [45] Abilities and Powers \nAs one of the Yonko , Kaido is among the strongest pirates alive, [3] renowned as the \"Strongest Creature in the World\". [6] He attempted to take Whitebeard's life, something few would dare, and subsequently clashed with Shanks . [14] When Gekko Moriah was in his prime, Kaido fought him and emerged victorious, having killed his entire crew. [10] The Gorosei mentioned Kaido as one of the few people able to stop Blackbeard . [46] \nAdditionally, Trafalgar Law stated Kaido to be able to easily kill Donquixote Doflamingo , a world-famous and extremely powerful pirate in his own right. [17] Law speculated that even with an alliance with the Straw Hats , their chance of defeating Kaido is only about 30%, [39] although the statement is questionable, seeing as at that time Law was not serious about fighting him. [47] Kaido in fact defeated another member of the Worst Generation, Eustass Kid , whose bounty is 470,000,000, with apparent ease, [48] and refused to take Law and Luffy's alliance seriously regardless of what they accomplished, due to viewing the defeat of a Shichibukai as being nothing special. [20] \nSimilar to the other Yonko, Kaido has many underlings and other pirates allied with him [31] and is able to claim self-governing islands as his own territories. [23] With Caesar and Doflamingo as his associates, Kaido has created an army of over 500 Artificial Zoan-type Devil Fruit users, [34] his Gifters. Physical Abilities \nBefitting his bulk, Kaido has tremendous physical strength, and is capable of swinging his weapon hard enough to send a normal-sized person flying into the distance in one blow. [49] He once sunk nine enormous prison ships singlehandedly. [50] \nPerhaps the greatest sign of Kaido's strength is his apparent inability to die. He has been caught and tortured 18 times, and people as powerful as the Marines and other Yonko have attempted to execute him 40 times. However, he mysteriously survived every single attempt because every single execution weapon broke when being used on him. Most notably, Kaido has jumped from 10,000 meters from the sky onto the ground, creating a massive shockwave strong enough to sink a large ship nearby, and emerged only with a headache; it has even become a hobby for him to attempt suicide, only for it to fail. [50] Weapons Kaido's kanabō mace. \nKaido wields a giant kanabō fitting for his size; in conjunction with his immense strength, Kaido can use it to smash adversaries over vast distances. [51] History Past \nNot much is known about his earlier life, but sometime when he became a pirate, he had been defeated seven times and was captured eighteen times by the Marines and the other Yonko, causing him to live as a criminal. During those captures, Kaido was repeatedly tortured and given the death sentence forty times. However, no execution device was effective on him, and Kaido managed to sink nine massive prison ships. [52] \nAt one point in his life, he fought with Shichibukai , Gekko Moriah and defeated him in the New World ; [10] though the details of the battle are unknown, Moriah lost his entire crew to Kaido. [37] \nKaido also managed to gain possession of a Road Poneglyph , one of the four poneglyphs that could reveal the location of Raftel when deciphered. [53] \nSometime within the last four years, he began collaborating with the Shichibukai Donquixote Doflamingo and the rogue Marine scientist Caesar Clown to create an army of artificial Zoan Devil Fruit users, via SMILE . [34] Summit War Saga Marineford Arc \nWhen Whitebeard attempted to save Ace from his execution at Marineford , Kaido tried to attack him. However, Shanks intercepted Kaido before he could reach Whitebeard. [14] It is unknown how their encounter ended, but Shanks arrived unscathed at Marineford by the end of the war . [45] During the Timeskip Kaido looks down at a traumatized Momonosuke. Sometime during or shortly after the timeskip, Kaido and the shogun of Wano Country executed Kozuki Oden and pursued his son and retainers in order to interrogate them about a secret Oden knew about Raftel . [54] He told Momonosuke that his father was a foolish lord and killed his mother in addition to his father. [55] Dressrosa Saga Dressrosa Arc Kaido appears at the Kid Pirates' hideout. \nKaido went up to Ballon Terminal , where he encountered Urouge , who learned of his intention to attempt suicide and allowed him to proceed. Kaido jumped off the Sky Island and landed 10,000 meters below on the Kid Pirates ' base. However, he only recieved a minor headache and found himself face-to-face with the Kid, On Air , and Hawkins alliance. After cursing Whitebeard for having been able to die, Kaido yelled that Doflamingo needed to make preparations for battle before promising to start a massive war due to the world boring him. [56] Yonko Saga Zou Arc \nAfter their encounter, Kaido formed an alliance with Scratchmen Apoo and badly defeated Eustass Kid , placing him in a cell. [48] After Jack 's defeat, Apoo contacted Kaido in his fortress, revealing that they had lost all contact with Jack's fleet after they went to attack Zou for a second time. [36] Totto Land Arc Kaido vents his rage on his subordinates. \nAfter learning that Jack's attempt to rescue Doflamingo failed, Kaido was enraged at not being able to acquire any more SMILEs, which meant he could not gain any more Gifters. As he drowned his sorrows in alcohol, Kaido's despair turned to rage when his subordinates mentioned Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law , causing him to smash one out of the building with his mace. Kaido angrily stated that the two Supernovas were nowhere near him in power, pointing to the defeated Eustass Kid as an example.
