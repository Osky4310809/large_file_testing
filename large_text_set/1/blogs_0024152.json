McAleenan, Acting Commissioner, U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) recently filed complaints against U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after the federal agency demanded social media information from Muslim American citizens returning home from traveling abroad , reports the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).CBP allegedly demanded travelers' social media handles and poked around their public posts. The federal agency also potentially accessed private posts by demanding cell phone passcodes and looking through traveler's social media apps directly on their phones. Even worse, border agents allegedly physically abused a man who refused to hand over his unlocked phone. What someone posts on social media should have absolutely no bearing on whether or not they are allowed to travel. Demanding social media data is a blatant violation of travelers' free speech and privacy rights. EFF notes that the CBP's 2009 policy on border searches of electronic devices is \"woefully out of date.\" Please sign this petition to urge CBP to update its policies, making clear that CBP will not and cannot violate travelers' First and Fourth Amendment rights and will obtain a probable cause warrant before searching a phone or other digital device. read petition letter â–¾ The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) recently filed complaints against U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after the federal agency demanded social media information from Muslim American citizens returning home from traveling abroad.
