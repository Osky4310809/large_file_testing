The Angelina Jolie -led Maleficent pulled in $758.5 million at the global box office, the Kenneth Branagh -directed Cinderella grossed over a half-a-billion dollars, the Jon Favreau -directed Jungle Book came within $34 million of hitting a billion, and pre-sale tickets are selling gangbusters for Beauty and the Beast . \nSo the question is: Which fairy tale will that turn into a live-action film next? Back in May 2016, it was reported that Disney was provided with a new pitch for The Little Mermaid — based on Hans Christian Andersen's 1837 tale, which studio previously adapted into the classic 1989 animated film — that they reportedly loved - so much so that they began talking to producers about moving forward with it. \nThen, three months later, Deadline reported that Marc Platt and Hamilton‘s Lin-Manuel Miranda have been brought on to produce the project. Miranda is also working with eight-time Academy Award-winning composer Alan Menken — who co-created the music for the 1989 film — to write new songs. \nHowever, at this time, Disney hasn't green-lit the project yet, but we're sure that day will come soon enough, and when it does, the Mouse House will have to find someone to play Ariel. Who could that be? Well, as you can see the banner image, Anna Kendrick , Taylor Swift , and Miley Cyrus quickly come to mind, but there are seven others that could also portray the sweet and rebellious young mermaid with a heavenly voice. \nClick on \" Start Slideshow \" to see which actresses/singers made the cut! \nThe Little Mermaid (1989) synopsis: Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson) is a free-spirited mermaid, who is off on the adventure of a lifetime with her best friend, the adorable Flounder (voiced by Jason Marin), and the reggae-singing Caribbean crab Sebastian (voiced by Samuel E. Wright) at her side. But it will take all of her courage and determination to make her dreams come true—and save her father’s (voiced by Kenneth Mars) beloved kingdom from the sneaky sea witch Ursula (voiced by Pat Carroll).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:04:04.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
