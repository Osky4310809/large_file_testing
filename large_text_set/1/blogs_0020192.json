While we understand that it’s hard to resist a pair of breezy palazzos when you see one, it’s important to keep your body shape in mind too. And like always, we are here to help with a quick guide to finding the right pair of palazzos for your body type . \n1. Palazzos for pear-shaped women \nHave curvy hips, heavy thighs and a full rear? You are a pear, girl. But if you thought that palazzo pants are not for you, you are wrong. Palazzos are actually perfect for your body type as the flowy nature of the garment helps you hide those thighs you are so conscious of. Go for one that fits well at the waist and flares out from the thigh. Fabrics like chiffon or georgette will give the perfect silhouette without hugging your body. Look for solid colour palazzos and pair them with horizontal or zig zag striped tops as that creates the illusion of a broader torso, taking the attention off your bottom half. \nOur picks \n2. Palazzos for apple-shaped women \nWide torso, broad shoulders and full bust. If that sounds like you, you have an apple-shaped body. And palazzos can really help you create a longer and leaner look if you style them right. Since you carry a lot of weight around the middle, the idea is to create a vertical line with a pair of straight palazzos in order to look leaner. Monochrome looks work in your favour. Pick slightly loose fitting kurtis that end well below the hip. Soft fabrics like cotton or silk and deep V necks are your BFFs. But be wary of complex, busy designs. \nOur picks \n3. Palazzos for athletic women \nAthletic women are skinny and have a straight frame. Look for palazzos that fit snugly around the hips and have a medium to wide flare. Pair them with shirts for a busy day at work or a spaghetti top for day out with friends. \nOur picks \n4. Palazzos for hourglass-shaped women \nWell, you can flaunt any style without a care in the world. But if you are tired of those tight denims, churidars and dresses, it might be a good idea to try out a pair of comfy palazzos. Just go for fabrics that give you the perfect fall and swish as you walk around. Feel free to pair them with a top or kurti of your choice. Well-fitted at the waist, these enhance your curves while allowing you the ease of movement. \nOur picks \n5. Palazzos for short women \nNever go for voluminous styles as they will cover your frame completely. Pick light weight fabrics and narrow flares for a stylish look. Make sure you team your palazzos with a pair of wedges or platforms to get that perfect fall. \nOur picks \n6. Palazzos for tall women \nIf you are a tall woman, you don’t have to worry one bit as you look amazing in these wide-legged wonders. Palazzo pants accentuate your tall frame and would look great with shirts or kurtis. Pick palazzos with a medium to wide flare and team them with a medium length kurti to balance out your body proportion if you have long legs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T03:55:13.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
