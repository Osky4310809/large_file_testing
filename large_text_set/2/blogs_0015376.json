They would hook up for half an hour or an hour and that would be it,” alleged the source. \nThe Sun alleges that the rumoured 'affair' was an 'open secret among sections of the local gay community.' \nThe alleged affair ended in 2015, according to the friend. \nMirror Celebs has contacted Tom’s reps for comment. Neither Tom nor Lance have addressed the claims on social media.

I always knew it was going to happen at some point.” Tom proposed to Lance at home (Photo: Getty) They announced their engagement in The Times newspaper (Photo: Getty) Read More Tom Daley says he talked about marrying fiancé Dustin Lance Black in the first month they met \nLance added: “We were so busy making all these plans — we both wanted to have children; we both wanted to build a home of our own someday… Marriage is the foundation to all of these other big plans we have. So we knew we were going to get engaged — it was just a matter of when, and who does it.” \nThey have spoken about both wanting to propose to each other; they both secretly got rings and talked to each other’s loved ones - but it was Tom who got down on one knee first. \n“I had the ring box in my underwear, and when he came out of the bathroom, I just went down on my knee and proposed,” recalled Tom. “Then he ran off to the bathroom to get his rings, and he had this whole speech prepared, but he’s a writer so his was quite extravagant.
