Veena-Vani at State Home after being shifted from Niloufer Hospital in Hyderabad on Sunday | sayantan ghosh The twins were quick to adapt to their new home and surroundings and already started making friends. “The hospital had been my best friend for over a decade and now this hostel is my best friend,” Vani said. Both the girls have a bigger room now. “They are now about 14 years old and the government has taken the decision at a meeting held between health and the women and child welfare department senior officials. They have made special arrangements for the children. It is more spacious and better ventilated. Whatever more is required will be provided,” said Dr C Suresh Kumar, superintendent Niloufer Hospital. “As of now, the government wants to keep them at the State Home. The decision of shifting the twin sisters was made in their interest. The girls are getting older and their security too has be taken into account. There is an 80 per cent chance of mortality according to AIIMS doctors. Our hospital has nothing to do with the government’s decision on their shifting from hospital,” he said. ‘Ditched by parents’ Both the girls have been disowned by their parents, says Kumar, “Parents don’t visit their daughters regularly. Maybe on a few occasions like their birthday they see the children. They speak to them over the phone but that too is rare. The kids are, for all practical purposes, disowned by their parents,” the hospital superintendent said. Veena aspires to be an engineer and Vani a scientist. The twins, born in Nalgonda district, have remained fused together since birth. They first underwent an operation at the Government General Hospital at Guntur in Andhra Pradesh in 2004. From there they were brought to Niloufer Hospital here where they had been under the care of doctors. \nO", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T03:26:27.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
