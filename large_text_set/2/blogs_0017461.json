Another photographer handed the umbrella to Ramos.\n“It was a bad moment in her life,” said Ramos. “Unfortunately it was captured.”\nA few months later in 2007, Spears wrote on her website: “I apologize to the pap for a stunt that was done 4 months ago regarding an umbrella. I was preparing my character for a role in a movie where the husband never plays his part so they switch places accidentally. I take all my roles very seriously and got a little carried away. Unfortunately I didn’t get the part.”\nSpears was placed on two psychiatric holds the following year. Despite a successful comeback, including starring in a Vegas residency show, she and her estate remain under a conservatorship run by her father, Jamie Spears.\nRamos quit working as a paparazzo in 2013 to focus on filmmaking shortly after Kanye West allegedly assaulted him . West settled Ramos’ lawsuit against him two years later.\nSpears has not commented on Ramos’ auction.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:17:24.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
