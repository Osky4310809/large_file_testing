Here's How to Get Started. \nOutraged by Donald Trump? Then it's time to get your hands dirty. Most Popular By Megan Friedman Jan 30, 2017 The day after Donald Trump's inauguration, millions of women around the world took to the streets to make their voices heard. And at protest after protest after that, demonstrators heard one clear message from organizers: This is just the beginning. Ever since Trump won the presidential election, many women's groups have reported floods of people expressing interest in running for office, and that number has only increased since his inauguration.

At the beginning of 2017, women were just 19.1 percent of incoming members of Congress, and were just 21 percent of the Senate. Women made up only 24.6 percent of state legislatures, 10 percent of all governors, and 18.4 percent of mayors of cities with more than 30,000 residents, according to Emerge America, a group that recruits Democratic women to run for office. \nAt the beginning of 2017, women were just 19 percent of incoming members of Congress, and were just 21 percent of the Senate. Most Popular But there's a glimmer of hope now, at least. The day after the march in Washington, 500 women from across the country gathered at a training in the nation's capital to learn how to run for political office. Emily's List, a group that recruits pro-choice women to run and one of the event's sponsors, has had more than 3,300 women express interest in running since Election Day, and more than 800 of them signed up in the four days after Inauguration Day. Emerge America has seen an 87 percent increase in applications for its six-month training program since Trump's victory. And She Should Run, a nonpartisan group that encourages and gives resources to women who want to run for office, has had 6,500 women participate in its incubator program since Election Day. It's clear that women across the country are newly galvanized. But how, exactly, do you take the first steps? There's a lot of soul searching—and bureaucratic red tape—involved. Here are experts' tips on how to throw your hat in the political ring. 1. Think about why you want to run. Pick the three issues you care about most. Does Betsy DeVos' nomination for Secretary of Education get you fuming? You're not going to be happy on a local zoning board—you should run for the school board instead. Do you think your town isn't living up to its potential? Run for city council. Sure, running for office in general is important, but it's just as important to find a position that best fits your experience and passions in life. Figuring out what specifically drives you not only helps you determine what position is best, but also helps you craft an authentic message to get votes. \"Women often want to do something, and we have so many ladies come to us that are really nervous about telling their personal stories,\" says Lucinda Guinn, vice president of campaigns for Emily's List. \"But people need to talk about their hospital bill they couldn't pay, or that time they turned to Planned Parenthood for support. Those stories are important connection points to make sure that they're going to be good leaders and connect with their community.\" Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 2. Get involved in your community, and put your name out there. If you want to run for office in your area, but haven't put in time in your community, then you might not be ready yet. \"The first thing I ask people is, 'What have you done to show that you have been of service to people?'\" says Aisha Moodie-Mills, president and CEO of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Institute, which trains members of the LGBT community on running for office. \"If you don't have an answer immediately to that, you have to evaluate what you're doing in your free time.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Try going to city council meetings, or meetings of community associations, and speaking up. Volunteer for neighborhood causes that matter to you. If you belong to a major political party, attend their local meetings, and help out on the campaign of another woman who shares your values. When you do that, you not only help your local community, but also put your name out there and make valuable connections for your future political run. 3. Do your research, which means lots and lots of coffee dates. It can be maddeningly difficult to figure out not only who represents you, but also what seats are open and when they are up for election. (Think about it: There's no incentive from people in power to give information to people who want to kick them out.) So this is when you have to pick up the phone and talk to lots of people. Google your local leaders as much as you can, but you may have to head to your local board of elections to talk to an actual human being. Local government clerks can give you information like filing dates, campaign requirements, and important contact information for the race you need. \nThere's no incentive from people in power to give information to people who want to kick them out. But a few pieces of paper aren't going to get your campaign started. You need to talk to real people currently in power to get the inside scoop on the political landscape, and that's as easy as a cold call or email. \"Get some coffees on your calendar,\" advises Erin Vilardi, founder of VoteRunLead, a nonpartisan group that trains women who want to run for office. \"Elected officials want to hear from you, and after all, they work for you. Offer to bring the coffee to them and you're going to get that meeting.\" Once you get those meetings, ask officials where the opportunities are, and how to get them. And then ask them who else you should talk to, and start the process all over again. 4. Decide your timeline. Government moves slowly, and even though you might want to start coming up with a campaign logo tomorrow, you might want to hit the brakes for a second and figure out a timeline. Want to run in 2018? You have to start immediately. But if you want to run in 2020 or later, you have time to beef up your résumé and make connections before getting on the ballot. And that kind of preparation can win an election. \"One of the biggest issues for women is they often run too late in the election cycle,\" says Andrea Dew Steele, founder and president of Emerge America. \"Men are ready. The minute the next cycle runs around they're lining everything up, and the woman is really contemplating—is it the right time?\" If you plan out your political path far enough in advance, you can clinch coveted endorsements in your community that could make the difference between victory and defeat. Most Popular 5. Think local, at least at first. If you're running for office for the first time ever, start small. Local school boards and city councils are a good way to dip your toe in the political waters, and the more local the job is, the more likely you'd be able to keep your day job at the same time. Vilardi of VoteRunLead says that local positions are the way to go. \"You're going to see results sooner and it's going to feel great,\" she says. \"So much of government feels like it's not doing enough, not moving fast enough, and at the local level you can really get some stuff done. The top is sort of where it's ugly, but the local level you can use your power for good.\" \n\"Women often run too late in the election cycle. Men are ready\" But if you have some community experience under your belt, several experts noted that the state legislature is where you might make the most change. Currently, women and marginalized communities are being targeted in state legislatures across the country, and the only way to make change is to be there fighting back. \"We are under siege in the state legislatures,\" Moodie-Mills says. \"If you look at North Carolina as an example, when [the transgender \"bathroom bill\"] HB2 was being debated and voted on, we had no LGBT people at the table. That's why we were on the menu.\" Getty 6. Get schooled. Are you now fully self-actualized and prepared to run for a specific office? Even if you're not, there are trainings across the country to help get you started. Emily's List and Emerge America target Democratic women, Wellstone works with progressives of any gender, the Gay & Lesbian Victory Institute works with the LGBT community, Higher Heights for America recruits black women, and the New American Leaders Project works with new immigrant communities. And that's just the beginning: VoteRunLead works with women of all political stripes, Maggie's List recruits conservative women, and IGNITE focuses on women in high school and college. These are just a few organizations that are waiting for you—and can give you the skills, knowledge, and connections you need to mount a strong campaign. They'll get down to the nitty-gritty and give you information you didn't know you needed. 7. Find your dream team, and start raising money. One of the most daunting tasks in any campaign is raising money. Fundraising is a huge part of politics, and it can feel awkward to call friends and family asking for their support. But hey, you did it when you were running that half-marathon for breast cancer research, so you can do it for your own political campaign, right? And you may not have to raise as much as you think. \"People underestimate the level of support they actually have. That's partly a function of the image that those who are in office are wealthy white males,\" says Sayu Bhojwani, founder and president of the New American Leaders Project. \"But the campaign that you're likely to be running as your first campaign is not likely to be a break-the-bank kind of campaign.\" Depending on where you live, if you run for school board, you may only need to raise around $500 to $2,000 for a campaign, and some cities even match the money you raise by as much as six to one. And there are some groups that may help fund your campaign, like Run for Something , which recently launched to support progressives under 35. What you do have to do is find a group of people willing to put in a lot of time for you, whether it's your friend with an MBA who can be your treasurer to your graphic-designer cousin who can help make posters. They don't have to be political animals, but they do have to be devoted to your cause. 8. Know that you are enough—even if you lose. Experts say many women need to be asked over and over to run for office because they think they either aren't ready or don't deserve it. They think they're too young, too old, have too many drunk photos on Facebook. But men don't seem to have those sorts of issues, and that's why they're overrepresented in basically every form of government. And if you lose, that's okay! You've still gained a lot of experience so you can try again. \"People don't often realize that the very skills you hone in politics can help you outside of office and in your professional career and personal network,\" says Erin Loos Cutraro, cofounder and CEO of She Should Run. \"The very skills of networking and leveraging the influence that you have connected through your campaign is in itself important.\" The key to securing rights for marginalized groups is to have members of those groups in the halls of power. And if not you, who else is going to do it? \"If you are turned off and just kind of disenchanted with the leaders who are around you, look in the mirror because you're the person that we all need to see,\" Moodie-Mills says.
