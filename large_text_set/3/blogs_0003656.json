A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Feb 19, 2017 at 2:00pm PST \nGoodwin bagged a handful of goals and assists in the short time he’s been in Rotterdam (alongside fellow Australian Kenny Dougall), and has thrived despite sometimes starting matches and other times coming off the bench. \nThe Socceroo’s ability and commitment to the team was quickly noticed by Sparta supporters. \n“The [Sparta] crowd’s taken to me really well,” Goodwin told foxsports.com.au. \n“It’s obviously nice when you come on and the crowd chants your name. It gives me the confidence to go out there and make an impact.” \nWhile Goodwin concedes that the challenge of playing in Europe is always something he’s opportunities. \n“I was in the A-League for four seasons and I wanted to try and progress and be the best player I can be,” said Goodwin. 🔴⚪️ A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Nov 5, 2016 at 2:24am PDT \n“I feel being in Europe is the best place to do that and Holland is a really great place to learn you trade in football.” \nHe added: “I want to have game time and make an impact and play games for my country. \n“It’s something you dream of when you’re a kid. \n“I think being over here I have a good chance of doing that so long as I keep playing as I have been and making an impact.” \nGoodwin has been making that impact despite all the challenges that come with a European move. \nHe’s had to begin learning a new language, get used to playing on an artificial pitch as well as in snow (that he hadn’t seen since he was six) - as opposed to 35 degree heat in Australia. It was a transition which also resulted in sickness after Socceroos travel. A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Feb 11, 2017 at 3:29pm PST \nBut on top of that, Goodwin’s had to deal with injury, competing for spots against higher quality players and adapt to a new style of faster football, all while playing many more games than he was with Adelaide or Newcastle Jets. \nPlus, there’s the new added pressure of potential relegation from the top Dutch league. \nHowever, none of those factors have stopped him improving, pushing for selection at club and national level. \n“My mentality is going into every training session and bettering myself,” he said. \n“If I do that I think I have the ability to go further to try and play for the national team on a more regular basis. \n“I think if I keep improving like I am the opportunities will come and hopefully I take them.” A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Jan 16, 2017 at 1:17pm PST \nGoodwin has been in the last two Socceroos camps but hasn’t been handed an opportunity to play for Australia since a six-minute cameo against England in May 2016. \nIf he’s picked for the next camp ahead of the next two WCQs, Goodwin has a clear goal. \n“I want to try and work my way into the next camps and try and push for game time,” said Goodwin. \n“Every time I go in I learn a lot and I’m always hungry to be in the next one.” \nBut he added: “To do that I’ve got to be making an impact here with Sparta and doing well. \n“For me it’s about making as big an impact as I can and trying to get goals and assists and then from there if I’m in the squad, going into the trainings and doing the best I can.” A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Oct 15, 2016 at 1:45pm PDT A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Aug 15, 2016 at 12:36am PDT 🔴⚪️⚽️ A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Oct 16, 2016 at 2:52pm PDT A post shared by Craig Goodwin (@craiggoodwin16) on Oct 25, 2016 at 3:11pm PDT  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:33:47.908+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
