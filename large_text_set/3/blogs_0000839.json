The one exception is the game against Crystal Palace on April 1st, which remains a traditional Saturday 3pm kick-off. * April 1 falls on a Saturday and April 30 falls on a Sunday, which creates what is surely a rare scenario of having six match-weekends in a single calendar month! Chelsea’s midweek showdown against Manchester City remains on Wednesday, the 5th of April, but has been pushed back to an 8pm kick-off, while the match the following Saturday, away to Bournemouth, has been pushed back to a Saturday 5:30pm kick-off. The other three Premier League games currently scheduled for April, away at Manchester United, home to Southampton, and away at Everton have all been made Sunday kick-offs. The Southampton match (now April 23) falls on FA Cup semifinal weekend, so should Chelsea beat Manchester United in the previous round, that Premier League match will be rescheduled. Speaking of rescheduled games, there is still no date set for Chelsea’s postponed match against Watford, which was supposed to take place in two weeks but has been replaced by the aforementioned FA Cup quarterfinal against Mourinho’s men. On a personal note, I’m pleased to see that neither the Palace game (April 1) and the City game (April 5) were moved to different days since I will be attending those in person. That’s right, WAGNH on Tour, coming soon to the SW6.
