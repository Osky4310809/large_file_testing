The shop’s been open for about a year now and in that time their client list has shot up tremendously, in part due to their unique studio layout which includes pieces like Medicom Bearbricks, OG Obey artwork and a Nike shoot signed by Kobe Bryant when he visited Milan.\nLooking through the photos below, astute readers will also notice pieces from rap clothier Pauly, better known as @himumimdead . Notable tattoo clients of the shop include Marcelo Burlon and A$AP Bari.\nCheck out what the staff is rocking below and make sure to drop by should you find yourself in the Italian fashion capital.\nSATATTTVISION \nVia Alessandro Tadino, 3 \n20124 Milan \nItaly \nName: Andrea \nOccupation: Owner/Creative Director\nBrands: YEEZY SEASON 3, Saint Laurent, Cartier\nName: Antonio \nOccupation: Tattooist\nName: Mirko \nOccupation: Tattooist\nName: Paul \nOccupation: Tattooist\nName: Yuri \nOccupation: Tattooist\nName: Bigo \nOccupation: Tattooist\nName: Zano \nOccupation: Tattooist\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T12:32:01.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
