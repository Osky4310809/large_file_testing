The question is, are you exercising? \nThe human body is genetically programmed to move frequently. While modern technology makes life easier, it can become an obstacle to physical activity. For example, sitting in front of a laptop all day will make a person less physically inclined to move around. \nIn other words, “getting off one’s butt” isn’t a popular choice as against surfing the net or playing video games. In fact, gadgets have influenced people to become less social. ADVERTISEMENT \nHuman beings have evolved over the last million years from a fight-or-flight survival mode. Today, convenience through technological advances allows individuals to communicate faster without having to get up from one’s chair. \nThink about it: Prehistoric man didn’t have a chair to sit on. He was always on the move. There was no excuse for being sedentary. \nNow there is such a thing as diseases caused by inactivity. While the very act of sitting isn’t wrong, it will become detrimental to your health if you are a chronic sitter. \nDiabetes and heart disease have been linked to a sedentary life. If you spend a large part of your day without any form of exercise, you are at risk of developing a lifestyle disease such as diabetes, hypertension or heart disease. \nSitting too much for too long increases the risk of breast and colon cancer. \nIn fact, inactivity, especially prolonged sitting, is being placed in the same danger category as smoking! \nIn a 2012 study led by researchers from Harvard and published in the Lancet, it was determined that inactivity was connected to over 5 million deaths worldwide—more than the number of deaths caused by smoking. \nBut this doesn’t justify the choice of smoking over exercise. Chances are, if you do not exercise, you could be a candidate for depression. \nBlood circulation \nIt is also understandable that if you sit for prolonged periods, your blood circulation is compromised. Moreover, your lymphatic system will not be activated to move around and collect the toxins within your body. Worse, your feel-good hormones are reduced. \nOther biological effects include a negative influence on appetite, blood sugar balance, blood pressure, hormone production and blood fat. \nDieters, beware. There is a particular metabolic activity level the body needs. Inactivity will slow down circulation, increase blood fat and raise blood sugar levels. The result: a heart at great risk for cardiovascular problems. \nThe World Health Organization published “Global Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health in 2010,” which cites sedentary living as a risk factor for global mortality. Here are the top five risks: \n1) High blood pressure", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T01:51:21.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
