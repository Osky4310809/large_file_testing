Instead, they are both in a care home. \n“They’ve both gone downhill a lot in the past year.

Chris and Hilary, from Dorset, were diagnosed with dementia within just two years of each other (Photo: alzheimersresearchuk.org) \n“Mum constantly asks where my dad is, even if he’s standing next to her, and she won’t always recognise that that’s him. \n\"But there is a constant familiarity there, even if she doesn’t know it’s really him she’ll hold his hand and rest her head on his shoulder. \n“They loved walking and would walk for miles and miles, happily taking in where they were and enjoying the time together. \n\"We try to take them to the beach and other places where they can walk so they can still do that together.

In some ways, the pair's love story is reminiscent of the hit 2004 film, The Notebook \nBut adamant he had not, Chris asked her out on a date to diffuse the situation. \nThe couple married in 1969 and had three children together – Joanna in 1970, Victoria in 1971, and James in 1979. \nIn 2007, Hilary fell down the stairs and had a brain aneurysm, which led her to develop vascular dementia, which she was diagnosed with just a few years later. \nShe would repeatedly go missing after becoming lost and confused. \nNot long after, in 2012, the family were told that Chris had Alzheimer’s. \nThe couple lived in Lytchett Matravers in Dorset from 1984 until 2014. \nThey then moved to Parkstone, Dorset, to be right next to their two daughters, before they had to go into full-time care a year ago.
