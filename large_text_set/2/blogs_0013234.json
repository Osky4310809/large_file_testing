Bros. Claus Andersen/Getty Images \nDeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry are very good at basketball—good enough, it turns out, to play alongside each other in the NBA All-Star Game on their Toronto home court. When Raptors fans watch DeRozan and Lowry, they’re not just looking at the best guard tandem in the NBA. They’re also seeing best friends. Like, get-them-bunk-beds best friends. \nThat beautiful, unconditional bromance has escalated throughout their four seasons as teammates. On the court, DeRozan and Lowry share a telepathic ability to connect on alley-oops. Off the court, they hang out together, mock each other , conduct playful interviews , and generally carry on like brothers.
