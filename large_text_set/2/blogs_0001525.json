The takeaway here is to always believe in yourself and to continue pursuing your dreams, despite the setbacks you’ll no doubt experience along the way. \nThis “determination to succeed” is also something shared by one of Honda’s most well-known nameplates – the CR-V. Since it went on sale in the United States back in 1997, the CR-V has become America’s best-selling SUV. No surprises then that the fifth-generation CR-V is featured in the spot, as the nameplate passes the two-decade mark this year. \n“Since its introduction in 1997, (the) CR-V has set the standard for efficiency, practicality and driving fun, becoming a customer favorite and taking the title as America’s best-selling SUV over the past two decades,” said Susie Rossick, assistant vice president of Honda Auto Marketing. \n“To celebrate the all-new, fifth-generation CR-V , we wanted to share inspiring stories that bring to life what we mean when we talk about The Power of Dreams,” she added. \nIn the US, the CR-V is offered with two petrol engines – a 2.4 litre DOHC i-VTEC four-cylinder or 1.5 litre turbocharged four-cylinder. Both engines are mated to a CVT, and can be had in two- or four-wheel drive guises. A bigger vehicle than its predecessor, the SUV also gains an expanded feature set, which also includes more safety and driver assistance features. \nGALLERY: Honda CR-V (US market) 2017 Honda CR-V", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T14:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:55:34.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
