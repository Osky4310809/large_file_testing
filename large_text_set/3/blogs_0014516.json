Residents there had housed, fed and cared for the stranded passengers during that tragic period in American history. \nOne scene of the play has a Muslim character being strip-searched in an embarrassing way at the airport, as his fellow passengers board their planes soon after the 9/11 flight ban has been lifted. \nFormer Canadian Prime Minister Chretien, who presided when 9/11 happened, went on stage before Trudeau to speak of his memories of the tragic day.  \nIn his introductory statement, Trudeau spoke of the unique relationship between the United States and its neighbor to the north.\n\"There is no relationship quite like the friendship between Canada and the United States,\" said the prime minister, who espoused on the definition of true friendship.\nHe stated true relationships are not just about companionship but also about a willingness to care and help each other. \nHe praised the play for rendering tribute to that friendship.\n\"The world gets to see what it is to lean on each other and be there for each other through the darkest times,\" Trudeau said on stage of the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, Telegraph reports. \nBroadway's welcoming of Trudeau is in stark contrast to how audience members received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Vice President-elect Mike Pence when they attended a viewing of the show \"Hamilton.\" Both were booed by attendees. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T16:42:12.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
