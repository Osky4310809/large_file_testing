We’ve heard that the company is going to ship an S Pen with the Galaxy Tab S3. The tablet itself won’t have a place for the stylus like we’ve seen on the Note series. Samsung will ship the S Pen as part of a bundle with the tablet. \nAdditional accessories for the Galaxy Tab S3 include a Keyboard Folio and a Book Cover case. Samsung is going to release both Wi-Fi and LTE models of the tablet. Customers in the United States will be able to purchase one from Verizon and US Cellular. It’s unclear at this point in time whether the LTE Galaxy Tab S3 will be available from T-Mobile and AT&T. \nThere hasn’t been any indication as yet to suggest that just like last year there’s going to be an 8-inch model of the Galaxy Tab S3. The 9.6-inch Galaxy Tab S3 is expected to feature a 2048×1536 pixel resolution display, Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM and Android 7.0 Nougat. Samsung is likely going to release the Galaxy Tab S3 in South Korea first by next month. \nSamsung will formally announce the Galaxy Tab S3 on February 26 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:37:46.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
