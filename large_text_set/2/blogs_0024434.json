Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSir John Major tore into Theresa May tonight for pursuing a “high risk” Brexit strategy that will hurt working people and threaten the NHS. \nIn his first major speech since the EU referendum , the former Prime Minister warned “whole communities” will be left worse off if Mrs May drags Britain out of Europe without a proper trade deal. \nIn a searing blue-on-blue attack, Sir John accused his Tory successor Mrs May of painting an “unreal” picture of how the Brexit negotiations will pan out. \n“I have watched with growing concern as the British people have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic,” he said. \n“Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery.” (Photo: PA) \nAnd he added: “A hard Brexit – which is where we seem to be headed – is high risk. Some will gain. Others will lose.” \nSir John said that behind the scenes, relations with Brussels have already “soured” ahead of the looming Brexit talks. \nAnd in a scathing verdict on Mrs May's diplomatic efforts, he added: “A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK’s interests.” \nSir John warned the Brexit talks are likely to hit problems as soon as Mrs May triggers Article 50 next month, with the EU demanding a £60billion ‘divorce bill’ from the UK taxpayer. \nThe bitter row could end up in court, he warned, and see Britain marching out of Europe without any trade deal at all. \n“The trade negotiations will require statesmanship of a high order. There is a real risk the outcome will fall well below the hopes and expectations that have been raised,” he said. (Photo: REUTERS) \nAnd he made clear that if trade talks do collapse - leading to huge tariffs and other barriers on trade with Europe after we leave - it will damage ordinary people’s lives across the UK. \n“People voted to leave Europe in the belief it might improve their lives,” Sir John said. \n“If events go badly, their expectations will not be met, and whole communities will be worse off. \n“The particular fear I have is that those most likely to be hurt will be those least able to protect themselves.” \nSir John warned that the right-wing Tories who led the Leave campaign would then try to use Brexit to turn Britain into a tax haven-style economy, with pared-back public services. \n“It has worrying implications for public services such as the NHS – and for the vulnerable,” he said. \n“There is a choice to be made, a price to be paid; we cannot move to a radical enterprise economy without moving away from a welfare state.” (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nSir John also warned of the ‘political’ cost of Brexit as Britain is driven into the arms of Donald Trump. \nBut conversely America would be less interested in the ‘special relationship’ because it needs a close ally inside the EU, he added. \nSir John campaigned hard for ‘Remain’ during the EU referendum , and made clear tonight he still sees Brexit as a “historic mistake”. \nHe said the PM is right to now deliver the will of the people - but made a fierce defence of the right of pro-Europeans to keep making the argument for staying in the EU. \nIt follows a volley of attacks on his successor as PM Tony Blair , who said last week people should “rise up” against Brexit. \nSir John said: “A popular triumph at the polls does not take away the right to disagree. \n“Freedom of speech is absolute in our country. \n\"It’s not ‘arrogant’ or ‘brazen’ or ‘elitist’, or remotely ‘delusional’ to express concern about our future after Brexit .” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:52:45.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
