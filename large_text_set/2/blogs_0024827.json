North Hills defeated Upper St. Clair High School, 65-50. From local dispatches \nSaying its been awhile since Woodland Hills won a playoff game would be an understatement. the last time they had that feeling was in 1995 — until Wednesday night, \nThe No. 11 Wolverines (15-8) recaptured that feeling with a 47-43 win against No. 6 Mt. Lebanon (14-9) at Baldwin High Schoo in the Class 6A first round. \n“It was a big win for our program and the kids,” Woodland Hills head coach Odell Miller said. “The kids knew what was at stake heading into the game. We had a gameplan and it worked. I am so proud of them.” \nThe Wolverines were led by the experienced Deontae Robertson finishing with 20 points and Amante Britt with 14. Robertson hit two free throws with 12 seconds left to push the lead to 46-41 As freshmen, the seniors went through an 0-21 season, but Miller is glad they were able to stick around to witness this. \n“Our seniors stayed the course, They are a great example for our younger kids.” \nOther Class 6A games \nCanon-McMillan 70, North Allegheny 67: The No. 8 Big Macs (18-5) won just their third playoff game in school history and first since 2008 against the No. 9 Tigers (14-9).

Down by seven entering the fourth quarter, McGuffey tied up No. 9 Valley (11-12) at Baldwin in the last minute with a shot by Trent Belleville to send the game into overtime. Senior Colin Chapman took over in the extra frame for the Highlanders, scoring five of their seven points.
