Oscars 2017: Full coverage \nHe was the accountant who handed the wrong envelope to actor Warren Beatty, resulting in the blunder at last month’s ceremony. Media caption The moment La La Land’s producers realised Moonlight had won best picture \nMs Boone Isaacs said: “From the night of the ceremony through today, PwC has taken full responsibility for the mistake. \n“After a thorough review, including an extensive presentation of revised protocols and ambitious controls, the board has decided to continue working with PwC.” \nThe firm’s Tim Ryan will now take a “greater oversight role” at future ceremonies. \nA third person will also become part of PwC’s on-site team at the Oscars. This individual will have knowledge of the award winners and will sit in the control room with the show’s director throughout the event, she added. \nImage copyright Image caption Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel helped correct the error on stage \nJust before the best picture announcement, Mr Cullinan tweeted a backstage photo of La La Land’s best actress winner Emma Stone, minutes before handing presenters Beatty and Faye Dunaway the envelope for best actress in a leading role, rather than best picture. \nMs Boone Isaacs said Mr Cullinan’s distraction caused the error. \nMr Cullinan and his fellow PwC accountant Martha Ruiz were told they would never work at the Oscars again. It was the awards’ most high-profile error since they began in 1929. \nPwC took said the accountants made “a series of mistakes” and failed to follow established backstage protocols. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
