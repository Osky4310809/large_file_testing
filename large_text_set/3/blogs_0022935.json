He then slid the puck to Backes, who blasted it into the back of the net. \nThe assist gave Marchand his 80th point of the season, making him the first Bruin to reach 80 points since Marc Savard during the 2008-09 season. \nTo see Marchand set up Backes, check out the Arbella Coverage Cam above. \nThumbnail photo from Tom Szczerbowski/USA TODAY Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T09:02:32.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
