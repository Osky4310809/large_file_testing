It’s the first time this has come to my attention so I have instructed Liane Hornsey our new Chief Human Resources Officer to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations.” Kalanick continued: “We seek to make Uber a just workplace for everyone and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber—and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired.” 1/ What's described here is abhorrent & against everything we believe in. Anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired. https://t.co/6q29N7AL6E — travis kalanick (@travisk) February 20, 2017 2/ I've instructed our CHRO Liane to conduct an urgent investigation. There can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber. — travis kalanick (@travisk) February 20, 2017 \n“On my first official day rotating on the team, my new manager sent me a string of messages over company chat,” wrote Fowler. “He was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn’t. He was trying to stay out of trouble at work, he said, but he couldn’t help getting in trouble, because he was looking for women to have sex with.” \nShe continued: “It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, and it was so clearly out of line that I immediately took screenshots of these chat messages and reported him to HR.” \nWhen Fowler reported the behavior she “was told by both HR and upper management that even though this was clearly sexual harassment and he was propositioning me, it was this man’s first offense, and that they wouldn’t feel comfortable giving him anything other than a warning and a stern talking-to.” \nReporting the incident allegedly had a negative impact on her ability to move up in the company, according to Fowler’s report. And she wasn’t alone: During her time at the company, Fowler claims to have spoken with other female engineers who told her they had experienced similar treatment. \nOther highlights from Fowler’s account: “Over the next few months, I began to meet more women engineers in the company. As I got to know them, and heard their stories, I was surprised that some of them had stories similar to my own. Some of the women even had stories about reporting the exact same manager I had reported, and had reported inappropriate interactions with him long before I had even joined the company. It became obvious that both HR and management had been lying about this being ‘his first offense,’ and it certainly wasn’t his last. Within a few months, he was reported once again for inappropriate behavior, and those who reported him were told it was still his ‘first offense.’ The situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and still nothing was done.” “When I joined Uber, the organization I was part of was over 25 [percent] women. By the time I was trying to transfer to another eng [sic] organization, this number had dropped down to less than 6 [percent]. Women were transferring out of the organization, and those who couldn’t transfer were quitting or preparing to quit. There were two major reasons for this: there was the organizational chaos, and there was also the sexism within the organization. When I asked our director at an org all-hands about what was being done about the dwindling numbers of women in the org compared to the rest of the company, his reply was, in a nutshell, that the women of Uber just needed to step up and be better engineers. … On my last day at Uber, I calculated the percentage of women who were still in the org. Out of over 150 engineers in the SRE teams, only 3 [percent] were women.” \nIn summarizing another incident, Fowler wrote that the director of Uber’s engineering organization promised to order leather jackets for all SRE team members but later declined to do so for the group’s approximately six women, attributing the decision to the fact that the company got a discount for the men’s jackets since it ordered more than 120 of them. According to Fowler’s account, the director responded to her subsequent complaint by “saying that if we women really wanted equality, then we should realize we were getting equality by not getting the leather jackets.” She continued, “We were told that if we wanted leather jackets, we women needed to find jackets that were the same price as the bulk-order price of the men’s jackets.” \nUber has declined to comment beyond Kalanick’s statement. Fowler did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
