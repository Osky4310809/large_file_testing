Even the stars of the show, including her on-screen husband Kevin McKidd , have been crying out for her to return to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\nNow Sandra Oh has said that she’s unsure whether she’d return to the Grey’s Anatomy or not. \nOh appeared on Access Hollywood Live to promote her new movie Catfight , where she was quizzed about whether she’d considering donning her scrubs and becoming Christina Yang again.\n“As an actor, as an artist, it’s a full life that one has,” she said, recalling the ABC drama fondly. “And as I look back to that time, which is extremely important and deeply meaningful to me, and it means a lot to me that a whole generation, a new generation of fans are discovering the show. So it means a lot.” \nWhen quizzed further about whether she would consider a return to the show, Oh initially said no.\n“At this point… No, I don’t think so,” she said, before adding: “I just don’t know. It would have to feel right.” She also said that she had spoken to Grey’s Anatomy show runner, Shonda Rhimes, about the possibility of returning when the show eventually comes to an end.\nHowever, given that Grey’s just been renewed for a 14th season, and ABC have said they have no plans to end the long-running drama, it doesn’t seem like this will happen any time soon.\nMeanwhile, Grey’s Anatomy continues Thursdays on ABC.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:53:05.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
