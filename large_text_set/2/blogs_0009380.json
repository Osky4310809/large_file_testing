Previous decades of research have shown no link between personality similarities for romantic partners or friends, but that may have been because prior studies relied on self-reported questionnaires—now, researchers used actual behavior on social media to discern what people’s personalities are really like. \nBreathe Easy Exposure to dirty air can have serious consequences. People who breathe in air with more fine particulate matter are more likely to die prematurely than those who live with less air pollution, a study from China found. This was due to greater chances of dying from heart disease , high blood pressure , stroke , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). \nPop an Aspirin The same drug that can ease your headache might have an even greater benefit: cancer protection.

Tumors need new blood vessels to grow, and aspirin may interfere with that process, the scientists say. \nCheck Your Cheese Some kinds of Sargento cheese may be contaminated with listeria bacteria , CNN reports.
