Surely a million or two is being added to his value with each goal? If he keeps it up, we can picture the scenes in the Toffees boardroom when he eventually departs... poll loading What will Everton do with Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley this summer? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T18:26:23.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
