TNN | Updated: Mar 17, 2017, 03.50 PM IST Former 'FRIENDS' star Matthew Perry appeared on Jimmy Kimmel 's show on Wednesday (March 16) and the actor made a lot of revelations. While most people eagerly share their stories about encountering Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , Matthew told a story which he was not very proud of. \"We actually beat up Trudeau\", Perry recounted on Jimmy Kimmel Live. \"I think he was excelling at a sport that we weren't, so it was pure jealousy. And, you know, we beat him up,\" the Friends actor recalled.

I think he was the only kid in school we could beat up ... I'm not bragging about this. This is terrible. I was a stupid kid.\" Born in the U.S., Perry moved to Ottawa with his Canadian mother after his parents split during his infancy. She found a job working for the Liberal Party and eventually became a press aide to then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Perry, who recalled being a few years older than Justin Trudeau, attended Rockcliffe Park Public School with him. The Ottawa primary school is where many politicians and ambassadors send their children. \"I think I was rather instrumental in him going to such heights, becoming prime minister,\" Perry quipped about the younger Trudeau to Kimmel. \"No, no. I feel shame. I don't want to think about it.\" WATCH: Matthew Perry - Jimmy Kimmel Full Interview Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
