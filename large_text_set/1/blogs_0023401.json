There was no report of any casualty in the blasts. Only a brick wall was damaged in Manipur, they said. \nIn Vishakhapatnam, more than 100 youths, including Telugu actor Sampoornesh Babu, were detained by police ahead of their proposed silent protest called to demand special category status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh.
