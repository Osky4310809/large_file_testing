This trait carried over into the design of the windows in his houses. Borrowing from organic motifs, Wright created a series of compositions suited for each house, from the tall, triangular stained glass windows of the Hollyhock House to the mahogany Samara clerestory panels of the Bachman-Wilson House .\nBut perhaps most famous of his window designs was the Tree of Life motif created for the residence of Darwin D. Martin House in Buffalo New York. The window reduced the image of a tree to its most essential geometric forms: a square representing roots; simple straight lines for the trunk; chevrons for the branches; and gold, red and green shapes as leaves. Each small piece of glass in the window was set into the brass frame at a specific angle to enhance light reflection to control the quality of light in the room.\n\nIn this photo series, the delicate construction of these windows is shown. Created for the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, the window are assembled piece by piece, with the brass frame being assembled around the glass pieces. In total, each window takes about a month to construct, with including 10,000 individual cuts of brass, a week of glass cutting, a few days to solder everything together. Check out the full series below.\nFrank Lloyd Wright Tree Of Life construction. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:08:12.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
