The musical starts preview performances on March 15, with opening night set for April 20 at the Shubert Theatre. \nThe musical follows Dolly as a widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again. \nMidler last hit Broadway for the hit one-woman play I’ll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers in 2013. She made her Broadway debut in Fiddler on the Roof in 1966 and went on to have an iconic career both on the stage and off. \nFrom Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous Four-time Tony winner Jerry Zaks is directing the musical, with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman and book by Michael Stewart.
