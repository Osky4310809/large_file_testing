Villa vs Athletic scored three goals in 4'47\". Milestone. â€” OptaJose (@OptaJose) February 18, 2017 \nThe ex-Sevilla man netted his second instants later with a cool finish, and rounded off his hat-trick in the 85th minute converting from close range. \nThat devastating run sealed a 4-1 win for Atletico, who remain in touch with the Liga front-runners four points shy of Real Madrid, albeit having played three more games than their city rivals. \nGameiro's triple also took him perilously close to toppling a seemingly unbeatable mark. \nHis three goals came in just four minutes and 51 seconds, putting him second to David Villa in the overall standings. \nThe current MLS star set the all-time record in 2006 while playing for Valencia, smashing three goals against Athletic in four minutes, 47 seconds.
