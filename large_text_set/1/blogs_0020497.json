As usual, Transfer Talk has its finger on the pulse when it comes to which rumours are picking up steam. Check out all the latest deals here . United miss another Mendes man \nParis Saint-Germain are winning the race to sign Manchester United target Goncalo Guedes from Benfica, and have agreed a £25 million deal for the winger. \nGuedes, 20, has been likened to Cristiano Ronaldo, and PSG coach Unai Emery said on Monday that he was of interest to the French champions. But the Mirror says negotiations are already advanced, and the player missed Benfica's 4-0 victory against Tondela this weekend amid speculation a move was underway. \nIf the transfer happens it would be the second time in a matter of months that United have been beaten to the signing of a Benfica player represented by Jorge Mendes after Bayern Munich signed Renato Sanches last year. Clubs line up for Young loan \nJose Mourinho is considering letting Ashley Young leave Manchester United on loan after a request from the winger, who has not started a Premier League game for the Red Devils since November. \nAccording to the Mail , Young, who joined United in 2011, wants to play more regularly than he has this season. The report adds that Mourinho did not plan to make any more changes to his squad this month and would have liked to keep the 31-year-old as part of his options for the Europa League and FA Cup. \nHowever, West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion, Swansea, Crystal Palace and Young's former club Watford have all been made aware of the situation. Rating the latest rumours \nIs Nelson Semedo heading to Chelsea? Is Arda Turan on his way out of Barcelona? Craig Burley has his say on the latest transfer rumours: Craig Burley assesses the latest rumours in football, including Man United target Nelson Semedo now being linked to Chelsea. Chelsea's Krul intentions \nTim Krul has emerged as a surprise target for Chelsea and could be the key to Asmir Begovic leaving to join Bournemouth. \nIt has been reported that Premier League leaders Chelsea are only willing to let Begovic leave Stamford Bridge this month if they can find a suitable replacement. And that is where out-of-favour Newcastle United goalkeeper Krul comes in. \nThe Guardian reckons that Krul, who is on a season-long loan at Ajax, but is yet to play a minute for the Eredivisie side, could return to England and join Chelsea on a temporary basis. Tap-ins \n- Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Celta Vigo and Atalanta are all keen on Lucas Biglia after he rejected the offer of a new contract with Lazio, AS reports. Argentina international Biglia, who is admired by Atleti coach Diego Simeone, will be a free agent in the summer. \n- Having seen an offer of £6m for Robert Snodgrass turned down, West Ham United are set to return with a bid of £8m which could reach Hull's £10m valuation with add-ons, the Telegraph claims. Snodgrass has been the Tigers' star performer this season scoring seven goals and setting up three more in 20 Premier League appearances. \n- It's not often a transfer rumour involves a big-name player being linked with a move away from the Chinese Super League, so strap in. Marca reckons Jackson Martinez could be on his way out of Guangzhou Evergrande after Felipe Luiz Scolari left him out of their squad for the Asian Champions League due to new rules about foreign players. \n- Southampton are considering a move for Napoli striker Manolo Gabbiadini , the Mirror claims, as Claude Puel looks to freshen up his attacking options. Only three teams have scored less than the goal-shy Saints this season, so the reasons for the move are obvious, but it is said they will have to up their £13m offer to £14.5m if they want to cut a deal. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T03:05:55.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
