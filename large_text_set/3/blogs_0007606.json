As The Guardian reports , two limited edition Bowie LPs, recorded in the 1970s, will be released in honor of Record Store Day’s 10th anniversary on April 22. \nThe first record, Cracked Actor (Live in Los Angeles 1974) , was recorded during the musician’s so-called Philly Dogs Tour , a name given to the second leg of his iconic 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour. (Fans may recognize some of the songs from the BBC documentary Cracked Actor , filmed during the same year.) The three-LP release is different from the 1974 Bowie live album, David Live , as it was recorded with a new band and backup singer. It also has a unique set list and includes two songs recorded for The Gouster , a long-lost 1974 album released in a box set last year. \nThe second Bowie album is Bowpromo , a rare Bowie promo album from 1971. It features alternate covers of songs that would later be included on Hunky Dory —Bowie’s fourth studio album—released later that year. Bowpromo originally featured seven songs by Bowie, and five by UK recording artist/actress (and onetime Bowie girlfriend ) Dana Gillespie. However, its reissue only contains Bowie's tracks. \nFull track listings for both albums are available on David Bowie’s official website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T23:21:51.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
