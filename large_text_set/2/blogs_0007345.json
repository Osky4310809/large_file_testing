Yeah, we’re seriously jealous AF. We have so much love for Bob Ross , and we’re naturally obsessed with the fact that Bob Ross is on Netflix . No human in the world has ever been as naturally soothing as the amazingly talented icon, so we get why this guy had a Bob Ross birthday party. What better way to celebrate?!\nChris Nervegna shared his birthday with the world via Twitter, and basically everyone freaked out because, well, how could you not? This is actually such a genius idea.\nIn the now-viral tweet about his Bob Ross birthday party, Chris Nervegna wrote, HAD A BOB ROSS PAINTING PARTY FOR MY BIRTHDAY. LOVE. MY. FRIENDS. BEST. DAY. EVER. HAD A BOB ROSS PAINTING PARTY FOR MY BIRTHDAY.\n\nLOVE. MY. FRIENDS. \nBEST. DAY. EVER. pic.twitter.com/HWCR9oDZl1 \n— Chris Nervegna (@Brovegna) February 5, 2017 Nervegna explained how things went down to BuzzFeed , saying,\n“I can’t explain to you how bad the paintings were coming out in the beginning. I mean, absolutely horrible. Towards the end,” Nervegna said, “everyone’s started coming together and looking amazing. I was shook.” And then things got even MORE amazing, somehow, because when he posted about his party on Twitter, someone else shared that they, too, had a Bob Ross-themed birthday party. @Brovegna I did it first pic.twitter.com/yhdqfpKyob \n— P-Diddy (@Rogers14Peyton) February 6, 2017 Like, OMG! Are we the only ones who haven’t given this a shot? We’re definitely going to give this ah-mazing theme a try for our next birthday.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:35:48.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
