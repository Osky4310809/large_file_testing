\nCape Town - Following the launch of a successful inaugural edition last year, Hollywood star and bodybuilding legend Arnold Schwarzenegger will be back in South Africa in 2017, as his globally successful Arnold Classic series returns to Johannesburg between May 5-7, 2017. \nIncreasing the number of codes on the schedule to more than 50 at this year's multi-sport festival, and with last year's participants looking for more space to expand their programmes during the second edition of the event at Sandton Convention Centre, organisers of the Arnold Classic Africa are aiming for a bigger and better spectacle. \nThe event will also hold another health and fitness expo, which last year hosted 200 exhibitors. \n\"Last year we were really pleased with the response and the turnout, and this year we want to make sure every visitor to our event has more to do and more to see,\" said Arnold Classic Africa partner Wayne Price. \n\"After attracting world-renowned stars to compete in 2016, we are aiming to do the same once again, and the additional sports are expected to attract more athletes and spectators. \n\"With just 100 days to go, the excitement is building fast and we are eager to host another spectacular showpiece.\" \nOne of the world's most inclusive and popular sports festivals, the Arnold Classic was founded 30 years ago by Schwarzenegger, a former Mr Universe and seven-time Mr Olympia, when he launched the inaugural event in Columbus, Ohio. \nHaving since expanded to six continents, the franchise has become one of the fastest growing multi-sport series around the globe. \nThe African leg made a significant impact from the start, and in October last year the Arnold Classic Africa won the accolade for Best Domestic Event Contribution to Tourism Growth at the Events Tourism Exchange Awards. \nThe 2017 Arnold Classic Africa will again be held in partnership with the Gauteng provincial government and the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC). \n\"We are pleased to once again play a role in such a popular event, which helps us to meet our objectives in bringing people together and promoting health and fitness,\" said Faith Mazibuko, the Gauteng MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture. \n\"After seeing the success the Arnold Classic Africa enjoyed last year, we are confident it will once again be enjoyed by thousands of people in our province, across the country and around the world.\" \nFor information on tickets for the second edition of the Arnold Classic Africa, visit www.arnoldclassicafrica.com Read more on: arnold schwarzenegger NEXT ON SPORT24 X", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T06:36:07.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
