We love the vivid way she captures simple details and memorable moments‚Äîher photos draw us in and make us wish we were part of the scene. Gabriela grew up in Cordoba, Argentina, where she lived until moving to Montreal, Canada, in 2001. She identifies her main interests as portraiture, food photography, and lifestyle photography. We asked Gabriela a few questions about her photography, where she finds inspiration, and what advice she would give fellow photographers. \n500px: How did you get started in photography? \nGabriela Tulian: My first contact with photography was in 2011. At that time, my job required me to take pictures of commercial products, so buying a camera was the obvious choice. The first time was about a great deal of experimentation and fascination, and quickly photography began to take on great importance in my life. How would you describe your photography style? \nI‚Äôm constantly seeking to define my photography. It‚Äôs hard because I like to take a wide range of pictures. Most professional photographers recommend specializing in a specific style, but for me it doesn‚Äôt work. I follow my feelings and I capture what inspires me in that exact moment and place. Where do you find your inspiration? What are some of your favorite places to shoot? \nThere is always a creative quest for new inspiration. I try to travel or visit new places as much as possible. I listen to music to get in the mood to create‚Äîmusic that speaks to me. I also use communities such as 500px and social networks to follow the work of talented photographers. Besides, I get inspired by other artists‚Äô work the same way that I am inspired by the world around me, films, and even books. \nNature fuels my soul; as far back as I can remember, I‚Äôve always loved spending time outdoors. Shooting outdoors is a great experience; we have unpredictable conditions, locations, and some places truly offer stunning backgrounds to take the image to the next level. But it‚Äôs not always possible to go too far. I‚Äôm fortunate to live in a beautiful city, Montreal, because it also offers me much captivating scenery to work with. \nHow did you get started in commercial photography? \nShortly after I started, I was contacted by a microstock agency offering to buy some of my pictures. Today, commercial photography takes most of my time, and I adore this exciting world. What are your techniques for capturing great lifestyle photography? \nI try to be a spectator to the world around me, so I can capture that ‚Äúmoment‚Äù as spontaneously and authentically as possible. I love connecting with people in an easy and relaxed way; creating an atmosphere where we can really get the best from everyone and everything flows naturally. \nYou‚Äôve worked as an Assignments photographer for 500px. Can you tell us a little bit about what that experience was like for you? \nFor me, Assignments are extraordinary challenges. \nThey allow me to organize my work differently, and create according to the client‚Äôs needs. These are extraordinarily enriching learning experiences. \nParticularly, I love working with 500px. I like the staff‚Äôs personal touch. They make me feel very comfortable; they have always been there for any query, concern or unexpected situation, and I am very grateful for that. \nMany of your photographs feature women or girls. What inspires you to create these portraits? How do you get ideas for the composition, subjects, or themes of these images? \nPortraits represent a new world to me and I still have a lot to learn, but they allow me to convey new emotions that I otherwise would not be able to convey. \nAs my daughter is my most accessible model, she appears fairly often in my pictures, but in general I like people with character, who defy stereotypes. Regardless of where this new world takes me, I enjoy the learning process. \nHave you faced any challenges as a woman working in photography? \nBeing a woman has led me to more benefits, I believe. I have always felt supported by the entire photographers‚Äô community, and when it comes to clients, I think that being a woman has never caused any inconvenience. What advice would you give women working in the field of photography? \nFocus on your own vision; take lots of pictures. That is the best way to learn, improve, and find your own path. Do not despair when creativity disappears; it is just a cycle that comes and goes, and you have to learn to live with that (this is what I always tell myself üôÇ ). \nWho are some of your favorite photographers that are women? \nI have many photographers in mind, but here are a few:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T08:09:17.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
