Advertisement - story continues below \nThe specialist detected a “mass” in her uterus, which would require surgery and an egg reserve blood test before being able to determine whether or not she would be able to have children. \n“As she delivered the news, my heart raced and my legs shook,” said Falzone. \nFalzone added that the expertise and quality care of her “Earth angels,” a team of doctors including Dr. Andrea Vidali, Dr. Jeffrey Braverman and Dr. Mutahar Ahmed, are the reason she escaped having a hysterectomy. \nWhen Falzone posted the incident on Facebook, her friends and family were quick to show their support.

Reading it, I could feel your emotion in the article!! Here’s Hoping for the Best for u going forward!! God Bless.” \nAnother posted, “Diana — you are amazing!! Thank you for sharing your story. I love you and am proud to be your sis. Your strength inspires me.” \nTwitter followers were also supportive of Falzone, wishing her health and happiness. @dianafalzone I was sorry to hear about this, Diana. Good of you to speak out and open up. Discussions are always better than silence. \n— Logical Libertarian™ (@LgclLibertarian) January 26, 2017 @dianafalzone I pray for you! With God, all things are possible!! \n— Will (@adjutant171) January 26, 2017 \nFalzone said she is opening up about her story to urge women to “trust your intuition.” \n“If you have symptoms of endometriosis, do not be afraid to advocate for yourself. Trust your intuition and seek out a specialist. Remember, not all medical practitioners are well-versed with the signs of this disease,” said Falzone. \nThe young reporter has said she is considering adoption. \n“I strongly believe a child chooses you. If I’m meant to have a child biologically I will. If not, there are many children that need loving, supportive homes and when and if that time comes I would welcome that,” she told Daily Mail Online.
