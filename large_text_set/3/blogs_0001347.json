(Cue \" should I stay or should I go .\")\nThat pact, which was negotiated in late 2015 and entered into force in November 2016, is the first global warming treaty ever devised to commit developing and industrialized nations alike to take steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. It is the culmination of more than three decades of dogged diplomacy on this issue, and abandoning it would be a bold and risky move.\nSEE ALSO: No, U.S. climate scientists didn't trick the world into adopting the Paris deal\nIf the administration chooses to exit Paris, or to submit the agreement to the Senate for a vote, which the Obama administration deemed unnecessary, it would risk fierce blowback on the international stage from friends and foes alike (not to mention outrage from the domestic climate movement).\nIt would be the international relations equivalent of pleading with all of your friends and enemies to gather in one room to work on a vital shared concern together.\nThen, right after you reach agreement — largely due to your own herculean efforts — you let out an absurdly loud fart, the type of fart so loud that everyone knows you did it on purpose.\nThen you throw a stun grenade over your shoulder, slam the door as you run out, step on a rusty nail and fall down a flight of stairs.\nYou're left lying there, at the foot of the stairs, needing a tetanus shot, with several broken bones and a room full of newfound foes eager to retaliate against you for what you did in that room.\nThat injured person on the floor would be the Trump administration's foreign policy, were it to go through with a Paris Agreement withdrawal.\n(It took a masters in foreign policy to be able to write that, I'll have you know.)\nSeriously though, the U.S. is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet, and the biggest historical emitter — meaning that we caused much of the global warming problem in the first place.\nThe entire world — and I do mean the entire world — is united on the need to tackle global warming. And we're thinking of turning our backs on the rest of the globe at the very moment when there is finally agreement on this issue.\nIn other words, that's messed up.\nTo hammer home that point further, here's a list of all the countries that would be further ahead of the U.S. in addressing climate change if Trump pulls the rug out from underneath the Paris Agreement. Each of them has already signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, meaning it is already in force for them.\nYou can bet these are also the ones that will be most ticked off by a U.S. withdrawal.\nAfghanistan\nAlbania\nAlgeria\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArgentina\nAustralia\nAustria\nAzerbaijan\nBahamas\nBahrain\nBangladesh\nBarbados\nBelarus\nBelize\nBenin\nBolivia\nBotswana\nBrazil\nBrunei Darussalam\nBulgaria\nBurkina Faso\nCambodia\nCameroon\nCanada\nCentral African Republic\nChad\nChile\nChina\nComoros\nCook Islands\nCosta Rica\nSeriously folks this list keeps going.\nCote D'Ivoire\nCuba\nCyprus\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea (aka North Korea)\nDenmark\nDjibouti\nDominica\nEstonia\nEuropean Union\nFiji\nFinland\nFrance\nGabon\nGambia\nGermany\nGhana\nGreece\nGrenada\nGuatemala\nGuinea\nGuyana\nHonduras\nHungary\nIceland\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIreland\nIsrael\nItaly\nAnd going...\nJapan\nJordan\nKazakhstan\nKenya\nKiribati\nLao People's Democratic Republic (aka Laos)\nLesotho\nLithuania\nLuxembourg\nMadagascar\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nMali\nMalta\nMarshall Islands\nMauritania\nMauritius\nMexico\nMicronesia\nMonaco\nMongolia\nAnd going...\nMorocco\nNamibia\nNauru\nNepal\nNew Zealand\nNiger\nNiue\nNorway\nPakistan\nPalau\nPanama\nPapua New Guinea\nParaguay\nPeru\nWe're only on the letter \"p.\" Are you getting the point yet?\nPoland\nPortugal\nRepublic of Korea\nRwanda\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\nSaint Lucia\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\nSao Tome and Principe\nSaudi Arabia\nSenegal\nSeychelles\nSierra Leone\nSingapore\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSolomon Islands\nSomalia\nSouth Africa\nSpain\nSri Lanka\nState of Palestine\nSwaziland\nSweden\nThailand\nTonga\nTunisia\nTurkmenistan\nTuvalu\nUganda\nUkraine\nUnited Arab Emirates\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nUruguay\nVanuatu\nVietnam\nZambia\nGet all that?\nKeep in mind that this is just the list of countries that have both signed and ratified the agreement. The roster of countries that have signed, but not yet ratified the agreement is even longer, representing just about every nation on Earth.\nOfficials celebrate the completion of the Paris Climate Agreement at the close of COP21 in Dec. 2015 outside Paris, France.\nImage: Mori/AP/REX/Shutterstock\nLeaving the agreement would abdicate U.S. leadership on a critical issue that will shape our future in ways that we haven't even fully grasped yet, from where our biggest cities are located to how much food we can grow.\nIt would also severely complicate the Trump administration's ability to solve a wide range of problems around the world. In addition, it would hand leadership on this issue, and on clean technology development, to China.\n“There is a very high risk that there will be blowback from other countries on the rest of the Trump foreign policy agenda,\" said Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who served as a climate advisor at the State Department under President Obama.\nHe said the risk isn't so much that the U.S. delays its emissions cuts by a four-year Trump term, but rather that other countries, particularly major developing nations like India, Brazil and China back away from their pledges too.\nFor now, we're all still in that room. But the world is watching us closely.\nBONUS: 2016 was Earth's warmest year on record, continuing a three-year streak", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LwdcdpW4suvV5syAwCthZWFBZ88=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F403292%2F60781e19-d41b-4605-81df-c3273e447452.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lNfrQ2jYX0C7MPucWgY6AJHw5ig=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F403292%2F60781e19-d41b-4605-81df-c3273e447452.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/EDnPnbE2.jpg", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/climate-change-trump.html", "http://giphy.com/embed/lAETSZ2PMEKg8?html5=true", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/EDnPnbE2.m3u8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN1WwnEDWAM"], "published": "2017-03-04T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:43:33.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
