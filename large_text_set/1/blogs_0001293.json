They’re thinking about £75m would be more than right for a player of his age. \n“Costa is Brazil-born and the Chinese believe Brazilian footballers are best suited to their league. The division is full of them. Hulk, Oscar, Paulinho, Alex Teixeira and Ramires are to name only a few out here.” \nChelsea recently profited from the sale of midfielder Oscar to CSL club Shanghai SIPG for £52m, while Ramires headed to Jiangsu Suning in January 2016 for around £25m. \nCosta was reportedly interested in a move to China last year before Antonio Conte chose to hang on to the striker, with that decision playing dividends through the Spaniard’s top form this season.
