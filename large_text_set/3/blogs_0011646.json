Yeah, but it's important for me, above all at this point of the season, to manage very well the situation and understand when it's right, for example, to play with Cesc or with Matic. \n\"We are talking about two great players, for sure with different characteristics. Nemanja is more physical, more technical, less fantasy than Cesc. Cesc has more fantasy but is less physical than Nemanja.” \nOf the 27 League games Chelsea have played, Fabregas has been named in the first XI just seven times. Mourinho: It's Chelsea's fault they're not in Europe, not mine \nHowever, Conte has learned to appreciate the former Arsenal and Barcelona star even more because of the way he's handled the situation. \nHe added: “Cesc is showing he has a great impact for us. I hope to finish the season in the right way and to try to win (trophies). But for sure Cesc has shown himself to be a great professional but, above all, a great player. \n\"I'm very pleased to see that in him, his commitment and work-rate. This season he faced a new situation. \n\"In the past, Cesc has always played every single game. It's not easy to change. But, for sure, Cesc showed me that he is not only a great player but a great person. \n\"I think, this season, he has improved a lot in all aspects and, for me, he is a really, really important player.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:45:51.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
