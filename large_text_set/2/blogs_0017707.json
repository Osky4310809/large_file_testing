You might expect to see a bunch of new and trendy brands on such a list, but as it turns out, most of the fastest-growing franchises aren’t flashes in the pan; they’re companies that have learned how to sustain their growth over years and even decades. In fact, the average company on the list has been franchising for 24 years. And this year’s number one, Dunkin’ Donuts , has been going strong for 62 years, with no signs of slowing down. \nRelated: The 9 Advantages of Franchising \nAltogether, these companies added a total of 8,695 franchises in North America between July 2015 and July 2016.

Growth is one good indicator of a strong franchise system, but it’s essential you do your homework to find the right opportunity for you. Always read the company’s legal documents, consult with an attorney and an accountant and talk to current and former franchisees before you invest. \nCheck out this year's list and learn more about successful franchising:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:12:30.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
