And while we’re utterly stoked (because it means we’re that much closer to the U.S. March 17th premiere date!) right now we’re specifically fixated on Emma Watson’s fashion choices for the event.\nIn case you missed it, Watson recently created a new Instagram account called The Press Tour , specifically made for…you guessed it, the film’s press tour (because she knows how desperately we want to be a part of every single moment of this movie). And the very first posts entailed pictures of her Paris screening ensemble.\nIt’s so elegant it HURTS!\nA post shared by The Press Tour (@the_press_tour) on Feb 19, 2017 at 2:29pm PST \nWatson included a caption with the post, writing, “ Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, the new Co-Creative Directors of @oscardelarenta , created this Jacobian flower-embroidered duchesse satin bustier with an organic silk faille sash and organic wool trousers as part of their first collection. The entire look was made in-house at Oscar de la Renta’s NYC atelier.” She also noted that the heels were Burberry. \nOkay, there are so very many things to love about this ensemble. But we think the thing we love most is how effortlessly chic it looks. Watson (and of course, her designers) managed to create a look that is somehow understated while also achieving major WOW factor. We also love her bold red lips (very French!) and loose locks.\nOh, and we of course love this little detail: A post shared by The Press Tour (@the_press_tour) on Feb 19, 2017 at 2:44pm PST \nAS IF WE COULDN’T LOVE THE OUTFIT ANY MORE, SHE COMPLIMENTS IT WITH CHIPS!\nWe’re officially loving this new Insta account, because anything Beauty and the Beast AND Emma Watson-related is basically our favorite thing by default. Can’t wait to see what else she shares with us, and also totally stoked to see what other mind-blowing fashion she has in store.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:10:43.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
