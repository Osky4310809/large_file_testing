The incredible design, the reference to wider popular culture, the timing of the drop — it was hallmark Supreme.\nOf course, as with almost every single Supreme item ever made, there’s a backstory to the new Obama pieces — and it’s currently ruffling a few feathers on social media. Perhaps, justifiably.\nAs Instagram user supreme_copies points out, the story dates back to 2009, during Obama’s first year in office. The new president makes a visit to Ghana, and, to commemorate the visit, locals made “Kangas” — a long, flowing garment covered in vibrant, colorful patterns and political graphics that is traditional to Kenya and other African countries in the Great Lakes region.\nWith the preview and lookbook released today, I figure it's time to cover at least one piece revealed today- or should I say piece(s). We arrive at perhaps the most interesting collection of the entire season, the 'Obama,' series (which consist of a pair of pants as well). This isn't the first time Supreme has payed homage to Obama with a graphic (although many aren't aware), and in this day and age the collection only makes sense. We date back to 2009, Obamas first year in office. The then new President visits the African country of Ghana. To commemorate the visit, locals produced many 'Kangas,' a traditionally large piece of textile, riddled with vibrant patterns and political graphics, made to be worn (exemplified bottom right.) What has since been replaced with 'Supreme,' once said 'Akwaaba,' – meaning 'Welcome.' At the time, dresses and button-downs alike were made of the print, making their way into the US and specifically Harlem (exemplified bottom left). Actress Victoria Rowells memorably wore a dress of the textile the same year to the Emmy Awards. Interesting to see Supreme with a more recent reference, as well as take their own hand at the pattern with one of their more recently popular articles, the Anorak. Shoutout to @trmmll and @streetchief for the images and info! #supremeforsale #supreme4sale \nA post shared by Supreme (@supreme_copies) on Feb 13, 2017 at 2:06pm PST \n\nSupreme being Supreme, the streetwear label changed the word “Akwaaba” (welcome, in English) on the fabric to “Supreme,” and splashed it across the new pieces. This has led to some people accusing the brand of appropriating traditional African culture without giving proper credit. Fans of the brand, however, argue that Supreme has been doing this kind of thing since the beginning, and that it’s more of a homage to the design, rather than outright theft.\nThe sleuth behind supreme_copies also notes that actress Victoria Rowells wore a dress made from the same textile to the Emmy Awards in the same year.\nWhat do you think?
