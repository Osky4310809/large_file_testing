His bond is set at $500,000.\nDiggs, who survived the ordeal with just a few cuts, says she plans on relocating because she doesn’t feel safe in her neighborhood anymore. Her friend set up a GoFundMe page to help her raise funds to cover the moving costs.\nDiggs told the “Today” show on Monday she feared her attacker would kill her by driving the car in the river with her still in the back seat.\n“My biggest fear was [that] he was going to drive this car into a river. I’m going to drown here and no one’s going to know I’m in this trunk,” she recalled.\nDiggs then used the light from her insulin pump to find the trunk release latch – something she learned about while watching YouTube videos.\n“I just got the bright idea to use my insulin pump light, which is not a bright light, but it was bright enough to see,” she said.\nVideo shows Diggs springing from the trunk and running into the gas station. Station owner Yosef Al Sabah led a distressed Diggs to a safe place and locked the door before contacting police.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T17:46:48.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
