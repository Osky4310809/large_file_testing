Bolling, who doesn’t like McCain in general, said he doesn’t care for McCain “taking shots” so much at the president. \nGreg Gutfeld pointed out if the name of the game here is conservative orthodoxy, President Trump isn’t exactly the most consistent here. \nBolling pointed to McCain’s stances on immigration, war, and cap-and-trade before outright saying, “The biggest thing I don’t like about him is that he’s a well-respected senior senator who’s very vocally pushing back on a lot of Trump initiatives.” \nBob Beckel pushed back and slammed Trump for just making things up, as well as lashing out at people like McCain, but Bolling insisted, “Donald Trump is not gonna sit back and let John McCain undercut a lot of the things that he’s trying to do! I don’t blame him!” \nThey kept going back and forth and Beckel told him at one point, “You’re apologizing for Trump’s mismanagement of his job.” Bolling insisted he wasn’t. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:14:58.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
