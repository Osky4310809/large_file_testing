Stephen K. Bannon, who took over Breitbart's news website after his death, is now the top assistant to the president. \"My goal is to destroy the New York Times and CNN,\" Breitbart said in the video. \"And not just them.\" \"That they would take our criticism and our acting as their checks and balances --the fith estate on the fourth estate-- that they would correct themselves and become better citizens.\" \"IThey've chose not to go that route and I really believe and I'm committed to the destruction of the old media guard... and its a very good business model.\" Breitbart said. \"I believe that from that something better will come.\" \"The media class is the wall that we have to climb over in order for our voices to be heard,\" he concludes. \"Once our voices are heard, then Democracy will happen.\" Courtesy of the documentary: 'Hating Breitbart' Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:14:36.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
