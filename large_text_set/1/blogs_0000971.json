Hearty Crockpot Meat ‘n Veggies View this image ›\nSumnersgraphicsinc / Getty Images “I buy three to five pounds of meat (beef, chicken, pork, lamb…your call!) and put it in crockpot with some potatoes (cut in half or whole) and favorite veggies. Fill the crockpot with water so it just covers the ingredients. Then set to cook for six to eight hours on low. The longer you cook it, the more fall-apart tender the meat gets. This is cost-effective — you can get inexpensive/tougher cuts of meat (which have more flavor than expensive cuts) because they soften up in the crockpot.”\n— Albert Matheny , MS, RD, CSCS co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab and advisor to Promix Nutrition\nID: 10197522 12. Rotisserie Chicken with Quinoa, Salad, and Wine View this image ›\nCourtesy Brian St. Pierre “I love this meal because it’s quick, tasty, satisfying and requires minimal cooking skill.
