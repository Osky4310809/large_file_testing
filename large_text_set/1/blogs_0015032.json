The trailer of the actress’ web-series Maaya has been unveiled and people are intrigued by the story that looks like a passionate thriller. It is directed by Vikram Bhatt who has made many films in this erotica-thriller genre. Shama says working with Vikram was a fabulous experience. Here are excerpts from an interview…. \nAfter the much talked about Sexaholic, you are back with Maaya. Don’t you fear getting typecast in these roles only? As an actor, for a moment, yes I did think like every human being what if I get typecasted after Maaya. Then, my spiritual side told me that I could change anything if I wanted to. It is all in your hands and the choices you make that guide you in building your future. The only thing I can get typecasted is whether I am a good actor or a bad one. I don’t have any fears on that aspect. I just go for projects that give me a kick and liberate me as an actor and person. Maaya is much more than BDSM. When people will see it, they will realise it. I always wanted to work with Vikram (Bhatt). I chose Maaya as it has potential for an actor to perform. \nComparisons are bound to arise with 50 Shades of Grey. What is your take on the similarities? Honestly, there is nothing in common between Maaya and 50 Shades of Grey except the BDSM part and love story. However, Maaya is an intense love story while 50 Shades of Grey was a very Mills and Boons romance teamed with BDSM. In Maaya, BDSM is in the background. It is more about the fear of being accepted and a personal struggle to be what you are. It is also about love and to what heights you can go in your love for someone. There is confusion, sacrifice and a lot of other issues than BDSM. I cannot wait for people to see it. \nAs an actor, what is the challenge of doing erotica as a genre? As an actor, I don’t think. When I was very young, it was very challenging for me to think of erotica or love scenes for that matter. I did not experience life and did not have any idea. Now, I have loved and lived my life. I have grown as a person. I am normal like anyone else. I accept it (sexuality) very openly as it is who we are. There is no point pushing ourselves away from it. I would not want to be an hypocrite, it is not right. God has created the genre (erotica) and we came into this world because of eroticism. I have no shame in accepting it as I respect the Almighty. We are all beings at the end of the day. It is not very difficult for me as I see it as a natural instinct in a human. It is not tough to do erotic scenes per se. But in order to act in Maaya, I had to understand the world of BDSM. What is the frame of mind of people who indulge in it? What and why they like the idea were queries I wanted answers to. They are as normal as we are. It is just that they have different choices. It is that natural. It is easy to work with a friend whom you trust completely. Vikram is a fabulous human being. He respects artistes in every way. He helped me understand Maaya and what Sonia (Shama’s character) is going through. I was confident with him that he won’t shoot anything that looks bad.

How important is it in times when sexual crimes against women are on the rise? I think this is the time, in fact it is past time that we as human beings understand the sexuality of each other and become more understanding about it. There will be lesser crimes. As of now, their is no understanding and people are going berserk. They don’t understand this phenomenon within us. People do not talk about it openly. People are suppressing this energy, which is a strong force in a human being. There is no energy bigger than sexual energy. This is why it is called a violent instinct. We should let people understand that they need to express it correctly. They don’t have a fricking idea. This is the bloody time to accept ourselves. In India, sexuality was a discussed liberally in ancient times, then we killed that concept. Now, we need to help each other understand and accept their instincts so that they don’t do anything stupid or hurt people. \nHow was the experience of working with Vikram Bhatt? It was phenomenal and beautiful. He is extremely talented and clear about what he wants. If someone likes my work in Maaya, all credit to Vikram. I did not understand this genre. He told me what he wanted and I delivered. He says I am fab in Maaya. He has worked with so many actors, it is wonderful to hear such genuine praise from him. I remember after a scene he literally hugged me and cried. He said I was fantastic and I have grown in confidence as an actor post Maaya. He and his dad, Praveen Bhatt, who was the cinemtographer are just too funny. They made me laugh before such tough scenes that I had to beg them to let me be in character. I am missing shooting with them. I have learnt that you can film the toughest of scenes if you have a great environment around you. Vikram is very sensitive and sensible. He does not waste his artistes’ time. He is just fantastic. \nHow much importance do you give to sexual satisfaction as a woman? Sexual satisfaction is very important for a man and woman. It is sad that women remain unhappy with their sex lives as they lack knowledge. I mean, there are women who don’t know what is an orgasm. It is such a beautiful experience. Sexual happiness is important. For a great mind to exist, you need to be sexually very satisfied in life. \nWhich is your favourite erotic film? It has to be Basic Instinct. Sharon Stone is just fantastic in the film. It is just her eyes, they speak volumes about eroticism and power. I just love that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T06:05:04.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
