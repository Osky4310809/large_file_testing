The Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee is liable to drive Americans nuts. There ought to be a way to suspend the senators’ pay for every hour one of them talks.\nOr wheezes. I mean, I’m pushing 71 and it takes me an hour to answer the phone. But I’ve got nothing on Sen. Patrick Leahy. In Vermont they’ve got a horse-drawn plow that talks faster than he does.\nAnd what’s the purpose, other than to evade the voters? The confirmation process has become an elaborate kabuki play in which the senators try to get the nominee to tell them how he’s going to vote so that they can oppose him even though he’s qualified.\nNot that this particular nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, isn’t part of the problem. In the movie version, he could be played by Jimmy Stewart. And they could even use the old title “The Man Who Knew Too Much.”\nAnd who won’t stop reminding you of it, either.\nThis struck me when Leahy was trying to get Gorsuch to endorse extending constitutional rights to refugees who have never been within 1,000 miles of America. That would be good news for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has been blocking Trump’s so-called travel ban.\nLeahy, seeking to goad Gorsuch into endorsing the 9th circuit, asked whether “the president’s national security determinations” are “reviewable by the court?”\n“No man is above the law,” Gorsuch growled.\n“It is being asserted that their national-security determinations are unreviewable by the courts,” Leahy plowed on. “Do you disagree?”\nThat’s when Gorsuch launched into a disquisition on the Youngstown Steel case, in which the Supreme Court, in the middle of the Korean War, stopped President Harry Truman from seizing the steel mills.\nGorsuch quoted Justice Robert Jackson’s famous opinion declaring a president’s power is at its maximum only when he is acting with express authorization of Congress. But Gorsuch pulled his punch.\n“Listen, you schmekels,” he could have said. “You passed a law saying a president could ‘suspend the entry’ of ‘any class of aliens’ as ‘he may deem to be appropriate.’ So don’t try to hang this problem around my neck.”\nThe senators made another attempt to get themselves off the hook in the case of the most famous working stiff since Joe the Plumber. His name is Alphonse Maddin, better known as The Frozen Trucker.\nThe hapless trucker (whose case I touched on last week) had been fired for leaving his iced-up trailer by the side of the road on a freezing night. One senator after another got on Gorsuch’s case for backing up Maddin’s employer.\nWhat’s so maddening is that Gorsuch was siding with the Senate against the administrative agency that bent the law to benefit the trucker. So the senators are blaming Gorsuch for trying to enforce the law the Senate wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:42:50.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
