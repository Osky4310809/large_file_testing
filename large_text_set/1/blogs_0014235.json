Michail Antonio played a great ball in just behind me. I hit one in training in the week and hit the post. \n\"I thought I'd give it another go and it's gone in and I'm happy. It's been a while in the making - I've been trying for a couple of years. It's got to be the best goal I've scored.\" â€” Michail Antonio (@Michailantonio) January 14, 2017 \nHammers manager Slaven Bilic confirmed that Carroll has a history of attempting the acrobatic, even if his injury record still worries the ex-Croatia boss. \n\"With his history of injuries, I go a bit crazy when he does that in training because you don't want him to get hurt,\" Bilic said. \nConte gives no assurances over Costa \nNew Palace boss Sam Allardyce, meanwhile - still without a win since taking over at Selhurst Park - was also left in awe of the front man's quality, the pair having worked together when Allardyce was Hammers manager. \n\"It's a terrific finish from Andy Carroll and he's always had that in his locker,\" said Allardyce. \"The volley was outstanding. \n\"But he was all on his own, stood in the box, and we had three defenders doing nothing.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T01:49:38.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
