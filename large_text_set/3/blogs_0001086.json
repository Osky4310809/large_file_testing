Or maybe someone in the kitchen, as those jellies won't set themselves. \nBut Spartak Moscow defender Dmitri Kombarov threw all conventional logic out of the window in renting a lion for his five-year-old daughter. \nYup, the king of the jungle and one of nature's most feared killing machines. \nAdmittedly it was only a cub and Kombarov's daughter Ulyana was able to pose for snaps on social media playing happily with the little big cat. Ulyana and her birthday present (Photo: CEN/@dmitrykombarov) \nKombarov said on Instagram: \"My beloved daughter, today is your fifth anniversary. Your mother and I love you more than life.\" \nThe renting of big cats has become a status symbol for the Russian elite, with the going rate to hire them for parties is about 10,000 RUB (Â£139) for an hour. \nBut Kombarov's gesture has drawn criticism on social media with people suggesting that the cub looked like it had been drugged.
