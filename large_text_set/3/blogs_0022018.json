I failed math when I was a kid, but I think that’s kinda close. One fun day I will break the world record.\nGreat day on the links shooting scenes for our HBO’s #Ballers.\nSubsequently, I also hit two other great balls… when I stepped on a rake.\nOk, no more bullshit haha.. back to work. Have a productive day. #OnSet #Ballers #LasVegas #TheGolfingBeast Big shout out to my bud and the man himself @jordanspieth for my gear \nI know I’m in the minority here because The Rock seems like a gentle giant who visits hospitals and gives to charities and yada yada, but he is the KING of the humble brag. He’s clever with it too because he’ll throw in a couple self-depreciating jabs in, but the brag always outweighs the self-burn. Self-burn: “I failed math when I was a kid.” Brag: “I’m an actor who just fucks around and almost breaks 50 year records because I’m big, strong, talented, and have a white smile.” Oh ya, I almost forget, the empowerment piece: “Have a productive day.” Wow, The Rock really cares about me!\nI say all this knowing that if I ever spent time with the dude, I’d name my son after him. But until then, I don’t need to be constantly reminded of how much more evolved of a man he is than me.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:29:02.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
