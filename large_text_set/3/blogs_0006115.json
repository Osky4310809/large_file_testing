Gary Cahill, acting Chelsea captain, knows this better than most, having won just about every trophy available to him during his five-year Chelsea career. He also knows that no lead is truly safe, having seen Chelsea first give up, then reestablish seemingly unassailable leads on our way to the Premier League title two years ago. \"The last time we won the League we were eight points clear at one stage and then, all of a sudden, we were level on goal difference. I know the points can quickly disappear. That’s why we need to keep focused.\" \"If everyone is aware of that and we keep the hunger, then we will be okay. Experience comes into play, especially at this stage of the season. We know what we have to do and we are ready to see this over the line.\" Manchester City had a chance to close the gap to eight points with their game last night. Having failed to do so will no doubt add to their frustrations from the weekend when Chelsea beat West Ham to keep well ahead of the chasing pack. \"I’m sure [Spurs and City] are frustrated. It was important we responded after what happened on Sunday. There have been times when we have played first this season and managed to get the result. This time it was their turn and the pressure was on us in that sense. I’m sure they were watching and hoping we’d lose. It could have been a sticky game for us, but we did enough to get the win.\" Liverpool will be the only top six team in action this coming weekend, as the rest of the big teams break for some FA Cup quarterfinal action. For Chelsea, that will mean a second meeting of the season with Jose Mourinho and his merry band of superstars. Cahill’s no doubt hoping to leave all them frustrated as well. \"It’s a fantastic game for us, for everyone involved. There are still big teams in it, so you’re not going to dodge them at this stage. If you go on to win the Cup, you certainly deserve to.\" -Gary Cahill; Source: London Evening Standard Game-by-game, week-by-week. It won’t be an easy ride, but The Double remains a decent possibility at this point.
