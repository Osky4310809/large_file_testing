SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 9 February 2017 \nH is reaction to the ruling was reemphasised with this post on the White House's Instagram account: A photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Feb 9, 2017 at 4:04pm PST \nT he tweet quickly became a meme, inspiring countless sarcastic responses and parodies from critics of the President.
