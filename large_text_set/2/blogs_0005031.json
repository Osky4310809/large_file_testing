CBS Television Studios is producing the series, which is said to be set in 1976 with ties to the original series. \nThomas’ version of the Lost Boys would reboot the original film starring Kiefer Sutherland, Corey Haim, and Corey Feldman. The series would ideally take place over 70 years with each season focusing on a decade, beginning in 1967 in San Francisco. \nThomas is still producing iZombie , which wrapped production on its third season. Maybe this will free him up to work on that Veronica Mars series we've heard about .
