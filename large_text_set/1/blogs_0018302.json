Judith Klinger told WCBS 880’s Peter Haskell it comes down to equality. \n“I don’t want her to have to think about women’s rights,” she said of her daughter. “It should be God given. She should assume it. Let her be entitled to it.” \nTrump was born and raised in New York City, but the majority of the city and state voted for Hillary Clinton. On Saturday, people donned pink knit hats and held signs that read “Women’s rights are human rights,” and “Putin’s puppet.” \nWomen, men, children and grandparents, many wearing pink, were eager to stand up and stand out to peacefully gain support for issues close to their hearts, CBS2’s Dave Carlin reported. \n“I mean look at this, listen to this. This is our moment, this is our moment!” Courtney Williams, of Astoria, Queens, said. \nDoreen Black, of Midtown, told Carlin she’s been to a lot of marches in her life. She said it wasn’t about protesting a president as much as fostering a sisterhood. \n“We need to get rid of this nastiness that is prevalent now,” she said. \n“We should all band together and demand our rights,” Barbara Golden, of Lower Manhattan, said. \n“We’re very diverse, and that’s what makes us great,” Flatiron resident Rebecca Saffer said. \nPatricia Palermo, one of six women wearing surgical masks that said “Save the ACA” (Affordable Care Act), said she would fight Trump’s effort to eviscerate the law. \n“His words and actions contradict each other,” she said. “We (as New Yorkers) know him that’s why most New Yorkers are against him.” \nZakiyyah Woods, a hospital senior clerk from Brooklyn, said it was important to host a local march to show that New Yorkers don’t agree with Trump’s divisive rhetoric on Muslims, women and Latinos. \n“We’re a melting pot. You hear languages from all over the world here,” Woods said. “No matter who you are and where you come from, New York is a safe haven. They come here to feel more accepted and safer.” \nMore From CBS News \nCelebrities Helen Mirren, Whoopi Goldberg, Cynthia Nixon, Courteney Cox and Yoko Ono joined local lawmakers, like Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and first lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray. \n“This is on us. This change is on us,” Goldberg told the cheering crowd. “We’re about to go further than you ever thought you could because what’s at stake is everything you believe in. We’re going to show America what we can do in New York.” \nNixon said she was there “to tell Washington they need to think twice about messing with women and think twice about messing with New Yorkers. We will not just roll over and play dead.” \n“Thanks to every one of you for coming today to show that we will not be silent, we will not be moved!” she added. New York City's #WomensMarch culminated with a protest outside of Donald Trump's eponymous tower: https://t.co/Tgey8Ddt1F pic.twitter.com/tFDoch8Pn6 \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) January 21, 2017 \nLargely, peace and non-violence prevailed, though the day was not without its moments of tension. For some, the main frustrations involved travel. \nDrivers in Midtown were stuck in traffic jams, and there was chaos first thing Saturday morning as crowds boarded buses from Manhattan to Washington, D.C. At Port Authority, some riders claimed their buses were overbooked and slow to get going. \nThe march was expected to end near Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, where the president conducted nearly all of his post-election business. It’s also where first lady Melania Trump and the couple’s young son Barron will remain. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
