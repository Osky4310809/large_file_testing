But Arena has had to make his share of changes to the roster , and he might still make more before the USMNT’s following match in Panama — and Feilhaber might be giving him something to think about. \nEither way, it’s a great goal and a nice way to start 2017 for Feilhaber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T05:02:13.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
