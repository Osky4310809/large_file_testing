The club lost to the LA Galaxy 2-1 at home on Saturday. \nRSL had also ended last season with a seven-game skid without a win, finishing in sixth place in the Western Conference and losing in the opening round of the playoffs. \n\"At the conclusion of last season, we felt that while we were disappointed in the end result, Jeff had done enough to earn another shot to lead the team in the 2017 campaign,\" general manager Craig Waibel said in a statement. \n\"We have a high sense of urgency for progress this season, and have made many offseason changes towards that endeavor. So, while these decisions are always difficult, we, as an organization, felt that it was necessary to make the change in our head coaching position now. \n\"The process for a hiring new head coach to lead the club has already begun. We will work quickly and diligently to ensure that we find the right leader that shares our values, passion, commitment and vision.\" \nCassar had been an assistant at RSL since 2007 and took over the top job in 2014. \nRSL said goalkeeping coach Daryl Shore will serve as interim coach, with the rest of the assistants remaining with the club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T02:33:39.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
