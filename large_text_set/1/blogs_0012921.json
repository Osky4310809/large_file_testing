(John Roark/Athens Banner-Herald via AP) \nIt's predicted to be an icy weekend, which means increased danger of going from vertical to horizontal on unforgiving pavement in one slippery second. \nSt. Louis University occupational science and therapy instructor Julia Henderson-Kalb provided recommendations on how to stay upright with a forecast of up to three-quarters of an inch of ice through Saturday night. \nStart with wardrobe selections before leaving the house. Avoid shoes with smooth soles or heels. Boots with non-slip rubber and grooved soles will provide the best stability. Wearing a heavy, bulky coat will not only keep you warm but provide some cushion in case you fall. \nWear sunglasses during the day to reduce glare and better avoid hazards, and don't bundle up to the point where your vision is blocked. \nRemember to not overdo it, Henderson-Kalb said. It may be tempting to grab all the groceries at once to avoid the cold, but it's better to make more trips. \n“You want to leave your hands and arms free to balance yourself,” she stated in a press release. “Beware if you are carrying a heavy backpack or other load — your sense of balance will be off.” \nJust like when driving a car in icy conditions, take your time. \n“Allowing more time lets you focus on safety and to be aware of the surroundings, both of which are important to avoid falling in winter weather,” Henderson-Kalb said. “Walking more slowly will also help your reaction time to changes in traction.” \nAssume that all wet, dark areas on pavement are slippery and icy. Move like a penguin by bending knees slightly and walking flat-footed. \n“Put your center of gravity directly over your feet as much as possible,” she stated. “Take short steps or shuffle. It also helps to stop occasionally to break momentum.” \nKeep your hands out of your pockets. Extending your arms out to the side can help maintain balance. In addition, keep eyes ahead, use hand railings on stairs and walk along the grassy edge of sidewalks or driveways for better traction. \nEven after taking these precautions, ice and gravity may still get the best of you. Henderson-Kalb offers the following tips if you slip: \n• If falling backward, tuck chin to chest and slap the ground with palms and forearms to help prevent your head, wrists and elbows from hitting the ground. \n• If falling to the side, try to allow your forearm to contact the ground first, lift your head to the opposite shoulder and continue to roll out the fall. \n• If falling forward, try to land on your side and then follow instructions for falling to the side. \n• If you hit your head or may have a broken bone, ask for help before moving. If uninjured, try to get up because it is helpful to get off the cold surface. \nMichele Munz • 314-340-8263 \n@michelemunz on Twitter \nmmunz@post-dispatch.com Winter storm may bring ¾ of an inch of ice to parts of St. Louis region this weekend \nForecasts are for 1/4 to 1/2 inch of ice in St. Louis city and county, and as much as 3/4 inch to the west in parts of St. Charles to the west, as well as to the southwest along Interstate 44 Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T03:54:31.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
