Bush, had told The Associated Press that the language in Mrs. Trump’s suit was “an unprecedented, clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain.”\nPainter continued, “This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money. That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress.”\nOther critics suggested that allegations about hurting the Melania Trump brand could open the First Family up to unwanted probing of their financial affairs in court.\nSEE ALSO \nMelania sues Mail Online a third time for claiming she was an escort 0:0 Melania Trump filed her third defamation suit against the Mail... Mrs. Trump still suing for the same $150 million in reputation damages and adds that the prostitute allegations continue to be repeated, most recently by New York Times journalist Jacob Bernstein at a Fashion Week event . Bernstein later apologized. \nHer lawyer, Charles Harder, and spokeswoman did not immediately return requests for comment on the changes.\nBut just a day after the suit was first filed Feb. 6, Harder said in a statement that the First Lady “has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so. It is not a possibility. Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted.”\nReps for the Mail Online did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. The news site eventually apologized and removed the August 2016 article.\nView this document on Scribd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:13:50.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
