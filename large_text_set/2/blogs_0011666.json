Obviously I haven’t changed what I’m heading there for. It doesn’t change my message at all.” \nThere have been a few reports since the election about friction between Mattis and Flynn . \nMattis said today he fully intends to work with whoever is on the president’s staff, explaining his main goals are to “listen, learn, help, and lead.” \nYou can watch the clip above. \nCorrection: A previous version of this post said that Mattis is the Homeland Security Secretary. He is the Defense Secretary. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:35:35.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
