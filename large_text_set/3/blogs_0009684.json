And a recent survey from Bankrate.com shows that 26% of Americans between the age of 50 and 64 have saved nothing at all for retirement. These and a host of studies and surveys support what many Americans already know: The majority of us are financially unprepared for retirement. \nMany people who don’t have the money to retire in place – that is, at home – may look for alternatives: either abroad, where it’s possible to settle down with a lower cost of living and access to affordable healthcare in some exotic corner of the world (see What Does Retirement Abroad Cost? ), or a different, more reasonable corner in the U.S. (see Finding a Retirement-Friendly State ). \nBut where to go? We looked at data from Bankrate.com’s “Best and Worst States to Retire” list to determine which states are the most expensive, taking into consideration each state’s cost-of-living rank as well as its tax-rate rank. We looked at the 10 worst (i.e., most expensive) states in each category, and found six that made top 10 appearances in both categories – making them the priciest places to retire in, overall. Here's the roster, starting with the most expensive state. New York \nCost-of-Living Rank: 48 (3 rd highest) Tax Rate Rank: 50 (highest) State Income Tax: 4.0% to 8.82% State Sales Tax: 4.0% Estate/Inheritance Tax: Yes/No \nNew York has the 3 rd highest cost of living in the U.S., behind only California and Hawaii (#1). The state’s 12.7% tax burden for 2012 (the most recent data available from The Tax Foundation, a private tax policy research organization) is well above the national average of 9.9% – and is the highest in the country. Taxpayers pay $6,993 per capita in state and local taxes each year, and the top rate for capital gains is 31.5%, the second-highest rate in the U.S. (after California). State and local governments collect about $2,494 per capita in property taxes, the 4 th highest in the nation. Connecticut \nCost-of-Living Rank: 46 (5 th highest) Tax Rate Rank: 49 (2 nd highest) State Income Tax: 3.0% to 6.99% State Sales Tax: 6.35% (7.75% for certain luxury items) Estate/Inheritance Tax: Yes/No \nConnecticut is the 5 th most expensive state in terms of cost of living. Its 2012 tax burden of 12.6% ranks 2 nd highest in the nation, and taxpayers pay $7,869 per capita in state and local taxes. Property tax collections amount to about $2,726 per capita, which ranks 2 nd nationally. Connecticut offers no exemptions or tax credits for most pensions or other retirement income – including Social Security benefits (unless the taxpayers has a federal adjusted gross income of less than $50,000, or less than $60,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). The exceptions are Railroad Retirement benefits and military pensions, which are both excluded from taxes. California \nCost-of-Living Rank: 49 (2 nd highest) Tax Rate Rank: 45 (6 th highest rate) State Income Tax: 1.0% to 13.3% State Sales Tax: 7.25% Estate/Inheritance Tax: No/No \nCalifornia has the 2 th highest cost of living and ranks 6 th in terms of tax rates. The individual income tax top rate of 13.3% is the highest among states that impose an individual income tax. Its 2012 tax burden of 11% ranks 6 th highest in the nation, and taxpayers pay $5,237 per capita in state and local taxes. State and local governments collect about $1,365 per person for property taxes. The state sales tax is 7.25% (the highest among the states mentioned here), and the combined rate in special city/county taxing districts can be as high as 9.75%.Although Social Security and Railroad Retirement benefits are exempt from taxes in California, all other sources of retirement income are fully taxed. Topping out at 33%, the state has the highest capital gains tax rate in the country. New Jersey \nCost-of-Living Rank: 43 (8 th highest) Tax Rate Rank: 48 (3 rd highest) State Income Tax: 1.4% to 8.97%S tate Sales Tax: 7.0% Estate/Inheritance Tax: Yes/Yes \nNew Jersey has the 8 th highest cost of living and the 3 rd highest tax rate in the country. The state’s 2012 tax burden was 12.2%, and taxpayers pay $6,926 per capita in state and local taxes. Property tax collections are about $2,989 per person, which ranks 1 st nationally. New Jersey is one of only two states that levy both an inheritance tax and an estate tax . While close relatives are generally excluded from the inheritance tax, other beneficiaries face tax rates ranging from 11% to 16% on inheritances over $500.The The estate tax is set to disappear in 2018. Rhode Island \nCost-of-Living Rank: 41 (10 th highest) Tax Rate Rank: 43 (8 th highest) State Income Tax: 3.75% to 5.99% State Sales Tax: 7.0% Estate/Inheritance Tax: Yes/No \nRhode Island has the 10 th highest cost of living in the country, and the 8 th highest tax rate, even though it lowered its top income tax rate from 9.9% to 5.99% in 2011. The state had a 2012 tax burden of 10.8%, and taxpayers pay $4,998 per capita in state and local taxes. Property taxes are about $2,282 per capita, which ranks 6 th nationally. Railroad Retirement benefits are exempt from taxes, and so are Social Security benefits if they fall below the applicable threshold ($80,000 for single filers and up to $100,000 for joint filers). Other retirement income is taxable at ordinary income tax rates. Vermont \nCost-of-Living Rank: 42 (9 th highest) Tax Rate Rank: 41 (10 th highest) State Income Tax: 3.55% to 8.95% State Sales Tax: 6.0% Estate/Inheritance Tax: Yes/No \nVermont has the 10 th highest cost of living and 8 th highest tax rate. Its 2012 tax burden was 10.3%, and taxpayers pay $4,557 per capita in state and local taxes. Property tax collections amount to about $2,331 per capita, which ranks 5 th nationally. Vermont taxes most retirement income at ordinary income tax rates, including Social Security benefits, which are taxed up to 85% (in sync with the federal rate). Railroad Retirement benefits are exempt. The Bottom Line \nSeveral states have tried to make their tax systems more appealing to retirees. Maine, for example, boosted the amount of pension income that can be excluded from state taxes, and Nebraska increased its exemption for Social Security income. The federal exclusion for estate tax is currently $5.45 million, and both New York and Maryland are incrementally increasing their exemptions to match the federal amount. \nWhether you are concerned with making your money last longer during retirement or leaving more assets to your children, the local cost of living and tax rate may be an important consideration during retirement. Not that non-financial factors – your interests, hobbies, comfort, health and proximity to friends and family – aren't important when choosing a retirement destination. Just bear in mind that wherever you retire (be it in place, in another state, or abroad) can have a considerable impact on your finances, as well.
