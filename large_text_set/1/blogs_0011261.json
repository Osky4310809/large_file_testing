Wilson was already a convicted pedophile when he molested his 23-month-old niece and another 14-year-old girl, Inquisitr reported. The 33-year-old previously spent four years in jail for sexual assault, and took his young niece in to his care because her parents were drug addicts. \nIn November 2014, medical officials discovered the child had genital injuries that required reconstructive surgery. Authorities were notified after the girl tested positive for several STDs including HIV, chlamydia and genital herpes. \nUpon conducting tests on all four people who lived in the child’s home, it was determined that her uncle -- who also had STDs -- was the suspect. \nThough he had chlamydia and a relevant criminal history, authorities did not arrest him.\nAround the same time, a 14-year-old girl informed authorities that Wilson sexually assaulted her. She tested positive for several STDs and discovered that she was pregnant. \nThe victim was sexually assaulted inside Wilson's pickup truck, a statement by the Houston Police Department read. The victim also told police she was sexually assaulted by Wilson on several other occasions.\n“Wilson admitted to investigators he sexually assaulted the victim numerous times over the past couple of years and also had intimate relations with several unidentified females,” the report added.\nWilson was charged with “super aggravated sexual assault”  -- an enhanced charge because of the age of his niece. \nThe jury took an hour to find Wilson guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison.\n“It’s a monster that does this kind of crime, this guy doesn’t deserve one minute less than the maximum punishment,” legal analyst Joel Androphy said, reports Inquisitr. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:03:43.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
