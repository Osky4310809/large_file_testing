Usually when we are not good, we lose. We are not used to it yet, so it feels a bit strange.” 'The first ugly game we won' 0:54 \n“It was intense and we had to fight. We had a few moments, so I don’t think it was only luck that we scored the equaliser. \n“It was clear we had to do a few things better in the second half, and we did. We were really in the game, we fought, took the battle and I liked that, it’s this kind of game which we haven’t won until now.” \n“The first five minutes of the first half were ok, but the most consistent team in style is Burnley, and they play how they play and are really used to it,” he said. \n“They fight for second balls, they had a better formation, and we couldn’t adapt that quickly. We didn’t find the target often enough and we lost the second ball. So they were always in the game. \n“I am happy about three points, that’s the most important thing.” Liverpool's German manager Jurgen Klopp (R) embraces Liverpool's English midfielder James Milner.
