Work. Photo   Let the record show that no one appreciates a good time — or knows how to make one happen by sheer force of will — more than Rihanna. The singer was nominated for eight Grammys — six for her album ANTI , one for being a featured artist on Kanye West’s “Famous,” and one for doing the same on Drake’s Views — and left the night empty-handed. This is a travesty, because ANTI is a fantastic departure from her usual pop anthems, not to mention her best album yet. Related Adele at the Grammys: \"I can't possibly accept this award … my life is Beyoncé.\" But because Rihanna is Rihanna, she still came prepared to endure more than three and a half hours of Grammys pomp and circumstance and mic problems. And because Rihanna is Rihanna, she did so with the company of a diamond-encrusted flask. — Rihanna World Tour (@RWTGuide) February 13, 2017 I’d say that Rih kept getting caught on camera swigging from the flask, but that would imply that Rihanna feels shame, and I wouldn’t dare lie to you. She clearly didn’t care at all.

And hey, Rihanna is nothing if not a debauchery egalitarian, so she even took a moment during the Grammys to FaceTime some lucky bastard into the room to share her view: BITCH RIH ON FACETIME pic.twitter.com/rVH98FHr0C It’s still a damn shame that Rihanna didn’t win any Grammys. But at least she came prepared to have the time of her life, no matter the (ultimately unjust) outcome.
