(Getty)\nA European report is claiming that refined palm oil, a key ingredient in Nutella, may increase your risk of cancer. In response to the news, some Italian retailers have boycotted the ingredient. \nThough initial concerns about palm oil were announced in May by the European Food Standards Authority, the news is only just reaching the US, where there are currently no FDA restrictions against its use.\n1. The EFSA Claims That Palm Oil Can Pose a Cancer Risk In May, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) claimed that palm oil is carcinogenic, and “generated more of a potentially carcinogenic contaminant than other vegetable oils when refined at temperatures above 200 degrees Celsius.” Glycidyl fatty acid ester (GE) is at the center of the cancer concerns, and GE is only produced when palm oil is heated above 200 degrees celsius.\nIn May, the chair of the ESFA panel that investigated palm oil, said: “There is sufficient evidence that glycidol is genotoxic and carcinogenic, therefore the Contam panel did not set a safe level for GE.”\nOn December 7, an academic study funded partially by UK charity Worldwide Cancer Research claimed a link between palm oil and the rapid spread of cancer in mice. Mice who were fed a high fat diet and large amounts of palmitic acid (a large component of palm oil) developed the most aggressive cancer spread, according to the article in Science Daily. \n2. Ferrero Is Defending the Use of Palm Oil Ferrero has launched an advertising campaign to assure the public of Nutella’s safety.\nIn their commercial campaign, Ferrero says that Nutella would not be the same without palm oil and that they “use it in a way that isn’t dangerous.” \n3. Nutella Was Trending on Twitter Wednesday Night Supermarkets wanna ban nutella, because it may cause cancer???!! Wtf 2017 i had big hopes for you!! pic.twitter.com/gludo7qcZY \n— Sansho (@sanshodelaine) January 12, 2017 \n\nAs of Wednesday evening, Nutella was trending on Twitter , and people across the globe were voicing their opinions on the news. Many have commented that despite cancer claims, eating Nutella is still worth it .\n\"Nutella can cause cancer\" automatic banning of the product. Cigarettes on the other hand, LITERALLY CAUSES CANCER.. still on the market. \n— 彡 (@ReconBlackbird) January 12, 2017 \n\n4. Palm Oil Is the Cheapest Vegetable Oil Palm oil is the cheapest oil in the market, and according to the Daily Mail , a switch away from palm oil could cost an extra $8-$22 million each year.\nFerrero’s purchasing manager, Vincenzo Tapella, told Reuters , “Making Nutella without palm oil would produce an inferior substitute for the real product, it would be a step backward.”\n5. Nutella Profits Have Gone Down 3% According to the Daily Mail , Nutella’s profits have taken a 3% hit since the EFSA claimed palm oil is more carcinogenic than any other oil. \nNutella makes up about a fifth of Ferrero’s sales, according to Channel NewsAsia. \nAs of January 11, the US Food and Drug Administration had not banned using palm oil in food.\nDwyane Wade: Photos of Gabrielle Union’s Husband Dwayne Wade, Gabrielle Union's husband, plays basketball for the Chicago Bulls.
