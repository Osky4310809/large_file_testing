Thatâ€™s a position that lends him to many smug proclamations that can blow up hilariously in his face. Naturally, he made a spectacularly short-sighted boast as the Cowboys tied up their game against the Packers with 35 seconds to go. \nNothing could possibly have happened after this, right?\nCongratulations to Dak Prescott for again outplaying Aaron Rodgers, again holding off Romo and again performing like a clutch MVP.\nâ€” Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) January 16, 2017 \n\nMeanwhile, young Sixers superstar Joel Embiid is a Packers fan, as it turns out. He was tweeting his support for Green Bay throughout the game.\nAaron Rodgers is the GOAT #GoPackGo \nâ€” Joel Embiid (@JoelEmbiid) January 15, 2017 \n\n\nReferees are the only thing that can stop us ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”\nâ€” Joel Embiid (@JoelEmbiid) January 15, 2017 \n\nAs he is perhaps the pro athlete who is currently the best at Twitter , Embiid is uniquely qualified to clap back at Bayless, and he took the bait from Skip like we all hoped he would. \nWell he's going homeâ€¦â€¦.. https://t.co/DPybmM9Lak \nâ€” Joel Embiid (@JoelEmbiid) January 16, 2017 \n\nAs far as trash talk goes, this oneâ€™s pretty tame from The Process. Itâ€™s almost a shame, because responding to a troll like Bayless gives him more attention, and thus more power. Any shot taken at Skip has got to be vicious to make it worth it. But weâ€™re still entertained by most anything Embiid does, so who are we to judge? Now weâ€™re secretly hoping Skip invites Embiid onto his Fox Sports 1 show. Thatâ€™d be something thatâ€™d get us to watch.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T05:04:57.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
