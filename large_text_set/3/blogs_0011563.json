But it is the sense of guilt that weighs heaviest on the 20-year-old. \nSyasneh became an unlikely revolutionary when at 14 years old, he and a group of friends sprayed-painted graffiti on the wall of their school in Deraa, southern Syria, in February 2011. \n“Ejak el door, ya doctor” or “It’s your turn, Doctor (Bashar al-Assad),” the black scrawlings read. \nIt was not long before the mukhabarat - the secret police - came knocking at his door. \nAfter Syasneh and his classmates were arrested the people of Deraa took to the streets in a rare show of defiance to demand their release. They marched every day until they were returned to their parents 26 days later - beaten and bruised. \nT he sight of the tortured boys only incited the demonstrators, whose peaceful protests were answered with bullets and tear gas. On March 15, cities across the country joined them for what was dubbed the “day of rage”, and the small anti-government movement turned into a full-scale revolt. \nThe adolescent prank set in motion events that continue to rock Syria, and the world, to this day. \nT he civil war, which passes the grim milestone of six years this week, has claimed the lives of some 500,000 people and left many thousands more maimed and injured. Whole cities have been flattened and more than a quarter of the country’s 21 million have fled, sparking the biggest humanitarian crisis of our era. \n“We saw the riots in Tunisia and Egypt and it encouraged us to spray the message,” Syasneh says, speaking to the Telegraph by telephone from Deraa in one of few interviews he has ever given. “But it was more of a joke, we never imagined there would actually be an uprising in Syria.” \nHe had grown up in a conservative Sunni Muslim family in Deraa, a breadbasket in Syria’s south, unremarkable but for its proximity to the Jordanian border. \nF or as long as he and his parents could remember, the Alawite Assad family had ruled the country with an iron grip. \nAt school he was made to recite slogans in support of the Baathist regime and taught to hold his tongue when it came to politics. \nA polite and studious teenager, he says it was out of character for him to graffiti the message that day. “But we were full of anger. Sick of the repression and the torture,” he says. \nHe was taken from his house in the middle of the night three days later and brought to the headquarters of the mukhabarat’s feared Palestine Branch in Damascus. I wasn’t sure if I would even leave jail alive \n“They beat me with cables, poured freezing cold water on me and electrocuted me many times,” he recalls. “They hanged me by the wrists from the ceiling of the cell and left me there for a day until I confessed to it and gave them the names of the other boys. \n“It was very, very hard, I was just a kid,” says Syasneh, who is thinly built and sports a cleanly shaven face that makes him appear much younger than his age. “I wasn’t sure if I would even leave jail alive.” A man walks on the rubble of damaged buildings after an airstrike on the rebel held al-Qaterji neighbourhood of Aleppo \nU pon his release he joined the protesters, who hailed him a hero for daring to speak out against the dictator. \nHe left school and continued to graffiti revolutionary slogans on the walls of government buildings under the cover of darkness. He helped rally grassroots political groups, which gathered each week to call for the removal of President Assad. \nBut Syasneh’s life would take a violent change of course when his father, a retired architectural engineer, was killed in the summer of 2013. \n“My dad was not a fighter, he had never held a weapon,” he says. “He was going to the mosque one Friday when he was hit by a rocket. By the time I got to the hospital he was dead.” Mouawiya Syasneh in front of a Syrian revolutionary flag Credit: Mouawiya Syasneh \nH e decided that day to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA), an anti-government militia formed of mostly rank-and-file army defectors which at the time was gaining in strength and numbers. He was just 16 when he first picked up a gun and 17 when he killed his first soldier. I didn’t care if I was martyred fighting the regime because then at least I’d be with my father \n“I never thought about shooting anyone before that, but he was my whole life and I wanted to fight for him. I didn’t care if I was martyred fighting the regime because then at least I’d be with my father,” he says. \nJ ust a month after signing up he was shot in the leg by a government sniper, the cause of the limp he still has today. \nAfter years of fighting, the cradle of the revolution is in ruins. \nHalf the population of Deraa, which once stood at 100,000, has left for neighbouring Jordan or claimed refuge in Europe. A large number of those who stayed were either arrested or have since been killed.

But he says he still cannot help but resent those who chose to leave at a time when their country needed them most, something he had the opportunity to do but declined. \nHe stayed in Deraa - never once leaving the city - where he still lives in his partially damaged childhood home with his widowed mother and three siblings. They live off his meagre wage from the FSA and often struggle to afford food.

He no longer dreams of going to university and becoming a pilot, as he did before the war. Nor does he allow himself to think about marrying or having children, but only of how he wants to be remembered when he dies: “As a rebel, the kid who brought freedom to Syria.” I never expected that my father would be killed or that thousands of other boys’ fathers would be too \nI ask him whether, given the chance to go back, he would do it again. \n“If I knew what I knew now I don’t think I would,” he answers after some hesitation. “I never expected it to amount to much. I never expected that my father would be killed or that thousands of other boys’ fathers would be too. I regret that so many innocent people had to die.” Chart of civilians killed in Syria Credit: SNHR \nT he ripples from that day at al-Banin high school have been felt far and wide. Syasneh, who only turned 20 in November, struggles to comprehend the magnitude of it all. \nThe conflict has drawn in more than 60 countries - bombing Syria in support of one side or the other. Russia’s definitive intervention on behalf of the regime and the Obama administration’s inaction look to threaten the post-Cold War world order.
