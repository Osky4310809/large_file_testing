After bowling the hosts out for 189 on day one, Smith’s men stood tall to finish the day at 6-237, with a lead of 48 despite a spirited and highly impressive display from India’s bowlers. The Australians had taken on the Indians at their best and come out on top. \nLess than two days later they were rolled for 112, suffering a demoralising 75-run loss. Having had the wood on India’s batsmen for the first Test and a half, the tourists found themselves chasing leather as Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane combined grind and style to rack up a match-defining 118-run partnership. All of a sudden, India had a batting order again. \nThe Australians had kept Ashwin reasonably quiet across three innings, but on day four they fell in a heap as the beguiling off-spinner tore through the country’s middle and lower order to finish with figures of 6-41. And just like that, India’s most important bowler was back in the swing of things. \nThe Indians have been fantastic front runners for the past year and a half and now that they have taken momentum back, the Australians will have to be at their best to turn this series around. \nJust ask Alastair Cook. Last year his English outfit came within four wickets of winning their series opener against India. They lost the five-match serious 4-0. Kohli's selfish celebration 0:32 \nWILL THE REAL STARC PLEASE STEP UP? \nMitchell Starc is Australia’s strike bowler, the man even Kohli is afraid of and a fearsome prospect when everything clicks. \nOn two occasions this series, Starc has turned a match on its head by taking two wickets in an over. \nIn Bengaluru he not only knocked over batsmen, he literally shattered a stump when clean bowling Karun Nair. \nThe problem is, in the other 40 overs he’s bowled there’s been just one wicket to fall. \nAustralia were hoping Starc would deliver the same sort of performances which rattled Sri Lanka last year, when the left-armer sliced through their batting to the tune of 24 wickets at 15 runs apiece. \nThat was Starc when everything clicks – firing in accurate yorkers at speeds of 150km/h, unsettling batsmen with bounce and sheer pace. \nThose spells have been too infrequent in India, where Starc has struggled previously. \nFrom four Tests in India he now boasts seven wickets (five from the opening two Tests of this series) at an unenviable average of 50.14. \nWith the second Test in the balance Starc was at his erratic best – following an unplayable delivery with an almost unreachable wide. \nSteve Smith needs to be able to call on the Starc from Sri Lanka if Australia are to retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy. Starc swings Test for Aussies 1:27 \nWILL HANDSCOMB MAKE THE MOST OF STRONG STARTS? \nPeter Handscomb has all the tools required to succeed in Asia. We’ve seen that thus far this series, with the unorthodox right hander enjoying starts in all four of his innings – he is yet to post a score below 15. For the most part his footwork has looked supreme; alternating between coming down the track and going deep in his crease to counteract the variable bounce and turn that has been offer. \nThe problem is none of these starts have gone on to be match-defining knocks, with his highest score of the campaign being 24. Done in by a delivery that scooted low from Ravi Jadeja in the first innings in Pune and one that bounced sharply from Ravi Ashwin in the second, Handscomb’s dismissals were of his own making in Bengaluru. \nAfter racing to 16 off 30 on day two – an impressive strike rate on a day that only saw 197 runs scored – Handscomb was out attempting to clip Jadeja over mid-wicket. He then fell trying to slog Ashwin in the second innings. In fairness to Handscomb, he was fast running out of partners in the second innings, but as things stand his record against India’s spinners is less than impressive. \nHailed as one of Australia’s best players of spin, Handscomb has averaged 15.25 against India’s tweakers. Ashwin's insane juggling act 0:52 \nWILL LYON BOUNCE BACK FROM INJURED FINGER? \nLost in the fallout of Australia’s stunning collapse and the DRS controversy was the injury drama surrounding star spinner Nathan Lyon. \nThe 29-year-old had a monumental influence during the first innings in Bengaluru, taking career-best figures of 8-50. \nHowever he struggled thereafter, going wicketless in India’s second innings despite sending down a team-high 33 overs. \nLyon’s control in the first innings was key to his haul of wickets, but this fell away badly as he mixed in full tosses and irregular lengths with the unplayable balls from day one. \nPart of the reason for this? The cracked callous on his spinning finger. \nLyon became troubled by the injury midway through India’s innings and received treatment to the right index finger – with an ointment applied – before going on to bowl a further 14 fruitless overs. \nThere is a nine-day gap between the second and third Tests, giving Lyon some much-needed time to recover and get treatment on his digit. \nThe Australian camp doesn’t seem particularly concerned at this stage, but that might change should Lyon’s grip on the ball and ability to get revs still be hampered when play starts in Ranchi next week. \nCoach Lehmann will be desperate for that callus to heal so he can have his No.1 spinner running at peak capacity.
