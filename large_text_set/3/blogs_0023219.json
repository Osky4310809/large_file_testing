The PFA Player of the Year was linked to Arsenal in August but eventually committed himself to an improved four-year deal. It seems, however, the Foxes face another period of uncertainty regarding the Algerian. \nCatalan newspaper Sport says Barcelona are determined to bring him to the Nou Camp and have been in contact with him 'for months'. \nArda Turan has failed to impress since signing for Barcelona and will be sold this summer, leaving space for a new attacking midfielder. As long as Mahrez is happy to sit behind Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in the pecking order, a move to Spain is a very real possibility. \nThe Spanish paper say, unsurprisingly, Leicester do not want to sell but negotiations over a fee have nevertheless begun. \nMundo Deportivo , meanwhile, focus on Isco's contract situation at Real Madrid. The Spanish midfielder has just over a year to run at the Bernabeu and is unlikely to sign an extension due to a lack of playing time. \nDespite reported attitude problems, Barcelona are said to have 'left the door open' to Isco at the end of his current deal - and that is sparking fear at Real Madrid. \nThe European champions want to sell him this summer rather than risk him moving to the Nou Camp for free in 2018. \nDiego Simeone has told AS he had a €35million offer to leave the club - but chose to stay because he feels at home at the Vicente Calderon. \n\"I didn't leave because I feel an identity with the club,\" he said. \nAS have also run an interview with Monaco's sporting director, Antonio Cordon. They focus on Kylian Mbappe, who was close to joining Real Madrid before he joined the Ligue 1 side. \nCordon is asked how much it would cost to sign the Frenchman this summer, but he refuses to say. \nItalian newspaper Tuttosport lead on potential Chinese investment in AC Milan. \nThe consortium are keen to pay in installments, say Tuttosport , but Fininvest — Silvio Berlusconi's company, who own Milan — are demanding the money all at once. \nThe paper also carries quotes from Croatian midfielder Marko Pjaca, who complains he is not being given enough game time at Juventus. \nLa Gazzetta dello Sport lead on the official announcement that from 2018/19, Italy will be given an extra place in the Champions League. All of Europe's top four leagues — England, Spain, Germany and Italy — will be guaranteed four teams in the competition each season. \nThe Italian paper also saves space for the London terror attacks. Former Italian boxer Maurizio Stecca, who won gold at the 1984 summer Olympics, was caught up in Wednesday's events. \n\"I saw death in front of me,\" he said. \"It was like being in Hell.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:58:11.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
