She came out of the gate in the late ‚Äô90s and early 2000s with a punk attitude and flaming hot pink ‚Äî and sometimes spiky ‚Äî hair. Since then, Pink has matured her punk look, while still keeping herself edgy with either a short bleach blonde or pastel pink ‚Äòdo. But Pink‚Äôs latest hairstyle is making us nostalgic for her early 2000s fuchsia days , and you‚Äôll see why.\nThe Grammy Award-winning songstress posted a photo to her Instagram on Friday revealing a new hot pink (and purple) angular bob. Pink‚Äôs comin‚Äô up, so we better get the party started!\nShe captioned the pic, ‚ÄúFeelin myself @colormeknights#rainbowbright.‚Äù Feelin myself @colormeknights #rainbowbright \nA post shared by P!NK (@pink) on Mar 17, 2017 at 12:09pm PDT \nIt certainly isn‚Äôt styled the same as it was back in ‚Äô99. But that spicy pink is definitely giving us #tbt vibes! YeaAaa Flashback to my very first VMA's in 99 Me and my little will be watching the shenanigans from our couch cuddle...

In classic Pink style, she‚Äôs kept it short, with shaved sides and longer locks on top. It looks like she let daughter, Willow, take over the pink hair patrol while mom went on a brief hiatus.\nHappy New Year #newlove #newlife #newenergy #newhope #newday the harts thank you for your love ‚ù§Ô∏è and we send it back to you in spades. \nA post shared by P!NK (@pink) on Dec 31, 2016 at 2:56pm PST \nBut with the pastel pink hair trend on the rise ‚Äî seriously it seems like everyone has tried pastel pink hair ‚Äî it looks like Pink wants to reclaim her title as Queen of the Pink Hair. Doing so with that beautiful pink to purple ombre has us bowing down without question.\nThanks Jackson Hole #familydatenight #zacbrownband \nA post shared by P!NK (@pink) on Mar 19, 2017 at 2:13pm PDT \nWe‚Äôre excited that Pink has returned to her roots (get it?) with a hot pink hairdo. Maybe she‚Äôll humor us and hair gel it into those dangerous spikes we fell in love with. But then again, Pink may have left those spikes in the early 2000s for a reason‚Ä¶\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:54:53.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
