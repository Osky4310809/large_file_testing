These green soybeans are a rich source of fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. They're also delicious . \nNow sushi-lovers need to be wary when eating the appetizer, as an edamame product from Advanced Fresh Concepts has been recalled in 33 states. A random quality testing analysis revealed a potential contamination of Listeria monocytogenes . What is the recalled product? \nThe products affected by the recall have the UPC code 0-23012-00261-9; are dated between January 3, 2017, and March 17, 2017; and are sold in 8-ounce (227-gram) packages under the name \"Edamame — Soybeans in Pods.\" Where were the recalled products sold? \nThe at-risk edamame was offered at grocery stores, cafeterias, and corporate dining centers in 33 states: AL, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, ME, MI, MN, MS, NC, NH, NM, NY, OH, OR, PA, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA, and WY. What are the symptoms of listeria? \nThis potentially fatal bacteria can cause an array of symptoms, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The symptoms can pop up as early as a few days after eating contaminated food or up to a few weeks later, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Who is at greatest risk? \nIn those who are healthy, the bacteria manifests in short-term symptoms like high fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. But in pregnant women it can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, premature labor, and illness in newborns. Listeriosis can be fatal for the elderly, those who suffer from chronic medical conditions, and individuals with weakened immune systems. What can I do? \nAccording to the FDA, no recalled product should be available for purchase right now. Consumers in possession of a recalled product should return it \"to the point of purchase for a full refund\" and those concerned about a product they purchased should get in touch with the store of purchase. Anyone displaying symptoms of Listeria should speak to a medical professional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:56:46.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
