Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic mayor of Chicago, recently said that he thought building a wall on America’s southern border would not be a priority for the new president. This has turned out to be wishful thinking. On January 25th Mr Trump signed a pair of executive orders that mandate the building of the wall as well as increasing the number of border-police officers by 5,000 and immigration-enforcement officers, who deport illegal immigrants, by a whopping 10,000. The orders also called for cutting federal funding of sanctuary cities, like Chicago, which protect illegal immigrants from deportation. Mr Emanuel reacted almost immediately. “I want to be clear: We’re gonna stay a sanctuary city. There is no stranger among us. We welcome people—whether you’re from Poland or Pakistan, whether you’re from Ireland or India or Israel and whether you’re from Mexico or Moldova where my grandfather came from. You are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American dream,” he said at a news conference after a city council meeting. Mr Emanuel is not alone in his defiance. The mayors of Los Angeles, Seattle, New York and other big cities made similar statements. Immigration-rights campaigners and human-rights activists are fuming about the president’s executive actions. Marielena Hincapié of the National Immigration Law Center, says that Mr Trump’s orders demand that local police become de facto immigration agents and authorise a supersizing of border patrol and immigration enforcement while freezing the hiring of immigration judges. She predicts that the presidential action will result in a monumental waste of taxpayer money and create chaos in the immigration system and courts. During his presidential campaign Mr Trump galvanised his adoring crowds by telling them that Mexico would pay for the wall. (“Who is gonna pay for the wall?” Crowd: “Mexicoooo”.) Before signing the executive orders, he told journalists from ABC News, a television channel, that the construction of the wall would start within months and that, initially, the American taxpayer would pay for it. But ultimately, Mexico would cover 100% of the cost, he claimed. Mexico has so far categorically refused to pay for the wall. It will cost billions. According to a report by Bernstein Research, the border between America and Mexico stretches 1,989 miles (3,200km), but the wall needn’t be as long thanks to natural borders such as the Rio Grande. Assuming a length of 1,000 miles and a height of 40 feet (12 metres), Bernstein reckons that the wall would cost of between $15bn and $25bn. Mr Trump suggested a price tag of $10bn. Within the ranks of the Republican party, many are critical of Mr Trump’s wall. Will Hurd, a Republican congressman who represents the Texan borderlands stretching from San Antonio to El Paso, released a statement on January 25th saying that “building a wall is the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border. Each section of the border faces unique geographical, cultural, and technological challenges that would be best addressed with a flexible, sector-by-sector approach that empowers the agents on the ground with the resources they need. [….] There is no question that we must secure our border, but we need an intelligence-led approach in order to effectively combat the 19 criminal organizations currently operating in Mexico.” If today brings bad news for those who hoped Mr Trump’s bark was louder than his bite, tomorrow is unlikely to be any better. He is reportedly planning to issue another executive order on January 26th that would mandate a temporary halt on the admission of refugees to America as well as an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. Part of the plan is to drastically reduce the number of refugees allowed to come to America this year from the already relatively paltry 110,000 to 50,000. Leading Mexican politicians are urging Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico’s president, to cancel his planned trip to Washington next week. They see Mr Trump's actions as offensive, and absurd. More Mexican immigrants have returned to Mexico from America than have migrated to America since the end of the recession, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Centre. But Mr Trump tends not to be unduly bothered by facts. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:06:54.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
