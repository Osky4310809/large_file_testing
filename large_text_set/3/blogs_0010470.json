Steven King is no stranger to controversy , but he kicked one hell of a hornet's nest on Sunday thanks to a tweet that was just straight-up racist.\nSEE ALSO: Aziz Ansari's 'SNL' monologue is a blistering attack on the 'lowercase kkk'\nIt started with a cartoon tweeted by the anti-immigrant account Voice of Europe, showing Geert Wilders, a far-right politician from the Netherlands who wants to end immigration and ban the Quran, poking a finger in a dam to hold off a literal wave of Islam.\nIt's racist as hell.\nBut then King upped the ante by tweeting the cartoon with the addition, \"Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.\"\nWilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO\n‚Äî Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017\nThere's a lot of racist buzzwords and phrases going on here for something that's under 140 characters. The phrase \"culture and demographics are our destiny\" certainly seems to read like a white supremacist point of view. And concerns about restoring \"our civilization with somebody else's babies\" is such a dog whistle that your local kennel is now deaf.\nBut don't just take my word for it: the Republican congressman's statement got the full support of racist-wisp-of-swamp-air David Duke . And not that we should be surprised: Trump has plenty of supporters ‚Äî and advisors ‚Äî who also back white nationalism.\nSo, of course, Twitter users, including some associated with the GOP, got whipped up in a frenzy over King's statement, many noting his previous controversy at the 2016 RNC when, during an MSNBC interview, he talked about the lack of contributions to society by \"sub-groups.\"\nOthers used the hashtag \" #someoneelsesbabies \" to show their displeasure with King's statement.\nGOP Congressman @SteveKingIA promotes the un-American ideas of white nationalism. Will any Republican congressmen condemn his bigotry? https://t.co/5etQ8fwZx2\n‚Äî Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) March 12, 2017\nMy part Chinese son and his white dad. #SomeoneElsesBabies pic.twitter.com/U1OE9iaQLC\n‚Äî heidi heilig üá∫üá∏ (@heidiheilig) March 12, 2017\nNot that his m.o. wasn't already known, but Steve King just publicly subscribed to white nationalism.
