I liked his competitiveness,\" said Dodgers manager Don Mattingly. \"He's got some weapons, so it's good to see him throwing the ball well and healthy. I don't even think he was healthy when I had him before, but he's always competitive.\" \nFife became the 11th Marlin to start a Spring Training game, which says something about his chances of starting the season in Miami's rotation. \n\"We'll see. He's throwing the ball good, though. He's had a good camp,\" Mattingly said. \n\"I've got to prove I'm healthy,\" Fife acknowledged. \"I know my career the last three or four years hasn't been exactly stellar in that aspect. \n\"But I didn't think the career was over. My agent said some teams were still interested; I did throw the ball well when I was able to throw last year, and I changed a bunch of things this offseason in terms of nutrition and training and sleep habits and the whole thing to try to revitalize this thing and keep it going a couple more years.\" Dick Scanlon is a contributor to MLB.com.
