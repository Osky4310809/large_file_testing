Samsung is expected to add support for Citibank and American Express soon. \nUsers, who sign-in for early access program, will be among the first ones to be informed when the service officially goes live. These users will also possibly be the first ones to access it when Samsung Pay goes live in the country. \nAdditionally, Samsung phones like the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge alongside the upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ is also expected to be compatible with the service. Other handsets that are eligible for the early access programme is also set to receive Samsung Pay support via a software update. \nSamsung Pay works with both NFC and MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission). This means it works with any payment terminal (card swiping or reading machine) that accepts contactless payments or the more traditional method of swiping your card through the reader. \nThere is a catch, however, in that it works with only the top-tier Samsung phones, leaving a great deal of phones (and users) out of its reach. \nIt takes just three simple steps to use Samsung Pay, according to the company. First swiping up to launch the service, authenticating via PIN or fingerprint and then making payments using your compatible Samsung phone.
