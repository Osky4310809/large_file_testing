Your prayers have just been answered. \nLabia lovers rejoice — artificial pads shaped like camel toes exist. And you can buy them online now. Image via Next Shark \nIf you are unfamiliar, “camel toe” is slang for the effect created by tight fitting pants around a woman’s groin, drawing attention to the shape of the external genitals. Most women are concerned about having camel toe. But now not only can we celebrate it, we can enhance it. Image via Aliexpress.com \nSo many questions come to mind. Should we wear our artificial vagina to daycare drop off? The grocery store? Or should we save it for a fancier occasion-say, Parents Night at our kid’s school? When we get home at the end of a long day, do we take our bra off first or our artificial vagina? Do our bra and artificial vagina need to match? Will we find ourselves asking “Does my artificial vagina make my vagina look fat?” \nWe’re guessing wearing one of these puppies would distract from the bags under our eyes from middle of the night feedings. Of course, you could just save your money and wait for Mother Nature to run its course. Vaginas sag like every other body part, especially if you’ve had children (cough, so I’ve heard).

What? \nHer: Oh my god. \nMe: (Trying desperately to move my distended belly to one side to see what all the fuss was about). \nMe: Ohmyfuckinggodwhatthefuck. \nHer: Should I get the doctor? I don’t remember this being a problem when you were born. \nMe: That’s super helpful. \nHer: … \nMe: Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. \nI could go on but you get the drift. Thanks artificial vagina maker , I don’t need the reminder. \nIf these lip plumpers aren’t for you, there are also products that are made to prevent camel toe. One such product, called Cuchini , has the slogan: “Our lips are sealed.” \nThe possibilities really are endless.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:07:43.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
