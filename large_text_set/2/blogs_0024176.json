He can do the waltz sans-gravity (you know you loved it in La La Land ). He can rip off his shirt and do the Dirty Dancing lift-the-girl-above-his-head move (we all saw it in Crazy, Stupid Love ). And now, it would seem that the handsome dad can bring the glory of ’80s prom style back with a single tux shirt.\nThe Best Actor nominee whipped out the ruffles tonight on the 2017 Oscars red carpet, pretty much teaching a master class in tuxes. It was admittedly a risk, but in a sea of plain tuxedos it was nice to see something fresh .\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images Ruffled shirt aside, Mr. Gosling opted for a dashing bow tie and shawl-collar tuxedo combo to round out his winning ensemble. No doubt his stylist Samantha McMillen pulled together the swoon-worthy look for tonight, but we’re sure Eva Mendes approved as well.\nFrazer Harrison/Getty \nAnd to anyone who might hate on your shirt, Ryan, we just have this to tell you: We’ll be your prom date!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:34:39.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
