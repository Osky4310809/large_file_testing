He made the transfer to Milan, is playing and has been called up for the national team. We will wait for events. It is good news to have the possibility. I think it’s €12m to recover him.” \nWhile Deulofeu has already graced the first team at Barcelona, Bellerin left for Arsenal in 2011. \nHe has developed into a proven Premier League and international performer with the Gunners, with his performances sparking speculation of a possible return to his roots. \nBellerin: Barca interest is special \nBellerin is tied to a long-term contract at Emirates Stadium, but Barca continue to monitor his situation. \nFernandez added: “He is a good player and he is playing very well at Arsenal. He is young and very interesting.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:56:10.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
