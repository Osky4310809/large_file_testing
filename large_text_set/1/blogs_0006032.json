The J.M. Smucker Company announced a limited voluntary recall on Tuesday of 20 kinds of canned cat food, affecting popular brands like 9 Lives, EverPet, and Special Kitty. The products impacted by the recall were produced between Dec. 20, 2016, and Jan. 3, 2017, and the full list can be found below, complete with UTM codes. The J.M. Smucker Company is asking customers who purchased any of the products currently being recalled to call 1-800-828-9980 or email consumer.relations@jmsmucker.com. \nThe Food and Drug Administration described the recall as both limited and voluntary, pointing to possible low levels of thiamine (vitamin B1) as the cause of concern. Cats fed a diet with a lack of thiamine can develop thiamine deficiencies, potentially leading to wobbly walking, circling, falling, and seizures, though most symptoms are usually reversible. That said, if you've noticed any of these symptoms in your cat, contact your vet immediately! 9Lives Meaty Pate Chicken and Tuna, 7910052228 9Lives Meaty Pate Seafood Platter, 7910000402 9Lives Meaty Pate Seafood Platter, 7910003670 9Lives Meaty Pate Super Supper, 7910000327 9Lives Meaty Pate Super Supper, 7910002860 9Lives Meaty Pate Super Supper, 7910052229 9Lives Meaty Pate Super Supper, 7910052229 9Lives Meaty Pate With Chicken and Seafood, 7910003640 9Lives Meaty Pate With Chicken and Tuna, 7910000324 9Lives Meaty Pate With Chicken Dinner, 7910000410 9Lives Meaty Pate With Liver and Chicken, 7910000312 9Lives Meaty Pate With Ocean Whitefish, 7910000420 9Lives Seafood Poultry Variety Pack, 7910053377 9Lives Meaty Pate With Chicken & Tuna, 7910003660 EverPet Mixed Grill Dinner, 7910053114 Special Kitty Beef and Liver Dinner, 8113112120 Special Kitty Classic Tuna Dinner, 8113112157 Special Kitty Mixed Grill Dinner With printed wrap, 8113109609 Special Kitty Mixed Grill Dinner Without printed wrap, 8113112119 Special Kitty Super Supper, 7910079041 Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T04:32:46.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
