Le Canard Enchaine said her wages went up during that period, earning between 6,900 to 7,900 euros a month before taxes. \nThe newspaper claims that she was re-employed by her husband for at least six months in 2012 after Francois Fillon was elected Paris legislator. \nAs the conservative nominee, Fillon , a former prime minister, has been championing transparency and deep cuts in the ranks of civil servants to lower state spending. Early opinion polls suggest that he and far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen could advance to the second round of the April-May election. \nDuring a trip to the southwestern city of Bordeaux, the conservative candidate hit back at the report, slamming the newspaper for what he called a misogynistic approach. \nHe said he was “outraged by the contempt and the misogyny in this story. Just because she is my wife, she should not be entitled to work? Could you imagine a politician saying, as this story did, that the only thing a woman can do is making jam? All the feminists would scream.” \nRead More: Why France’s Marine Le Pen Is Doubling Down on Russia Support \nFillon spokesman Philippe Vigier earlier insisted that Penelope Fillon’s work wasn’t fictional. \nBenoit Hamon, who is vying with former Prime Minister Manuel Valls to be the Socialists’ presidential candidate and could face Fillon in the presidential race, proposed that, in the future, close relatives of politicians should not be hired and paid for by parliamentary funds. \n“Lawmakers should not be allowed to hire their children, cousins, relatives or wives anymore,” Hamon told French public TV.
