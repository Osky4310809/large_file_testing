And this body-positive model’s side-by-side photos of herself wearing pink Spanx are just the inspiration we needed to love ourselves a little bit more .\nIn the two snaps, body-confident Instagrammer Self Love Liv , a young Englishwoman, wears Spanx pulled way up, holding in her body, and pulled down, freeing herself to breathe normally and feel comfortable.\n“Do you know how uncomfortable these things are,” she captioned the photo. “Don’t be fooled by campaign ads and TV shows and those fabulous Insta models. Spanx are created to give the illusion of a flatter stomach and smaller figure. You don’t NEED them.” SPANX I bought some Spanx about a year ago, hoping it would slim my figure and I could wear body con dresses. Do you know how uncomfortable these things are breathing was not an option! I felt tight, uncomfortable and restricted in the first photo. The relief of taking them off was amazing!! Don't be fooled by campaign ads and TV shows and those fabulous insta models. Spanx are created to give the illusion of a flatter stomach and smaller figure. You don't NEED them. I feel totally fine in the second photo, and I can breathe again! You don't need an item of clothing in order to love yourself. You don't need to wear a tight piece of material in order to wear a dress or top. WEAR IT ANYWAY. You are FABULOUS. You are FLAWLESS. You are BEAUTIFUL. Don't let any fucker tell you otherwise. Love your damn self! ❤ \nA post shared by Olivia (@selfloveliv) on Feb 8, 2017 at 10:27am PST \nYou can tell by the look on her face that she’s way more at ease in the second photo — Spanx are no joke!\n“You don’t need an item of clothing in order to love yourself,” Liv wrote. “You don’t need to wear a tight piece of material in order to wear a dress or top.” The amount of love and support I've had over the last few days has been overwhelming. I was on Teen Vogue (their website) and it was amazing. The response I've had has been incredible. I will not let the trolls win. I will not let negativity win. I will not let my eating disorder back into my life. If my body offends you, then turn away. Like I give a shit about you boo. I love every inch of me. My curves, rolls, fat, scars, E V E R Y T H I N G Deal with it ✌ \nA post shared by Olivia (@selfloveliv) on Feb 11, 2017 at 8:35am PST \nLiv is right about not needing Spanx to wear clothing you love — and your body will thank you for going without. Research has found that shapewear of this kind, if worn for too long, can have a serious impact on the body.\nSide effects can include meralgia paresthetica, a condition that “causes painful burning and tingling in the thighs when there is too much pressure on nerves that run through the groin,” according to the Los Angeles Times , and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Yikes!\nSo skip the Spanx and let your body be free. You’re perfect already!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:25:30.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
