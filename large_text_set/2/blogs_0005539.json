Reissig explained that his father visits his mother’s grave twice a day.\n“He has a routine where he clips some roses from his rose garden at home and delivers them to Mom. Then he hooks up a hose and waters her grass twice daily,” he wrote in the post. \n“With the recent drought, and hers being one of only graves getting watered, you can see that Moms stands out from the rest and is very beautiful. One day while watering he saw a young lady down from him kneeling at a grave and crying uncontrollably. Dad went down and talked with her and found that her husband had been an SSGT in the US Air Force and lost him in 2010.”\n\nReissig then revealed the amazing, selfless thing his dad did to honor the veteran.\n“After they talked and shared stories, she thanked him and left. Dad decided to Honor this soldier and start watering his grass along with Moms daily. He does it every day. He said it is the least he can do for him after all that he sacrificed for us. You can see his green grass in the pictures down from Moms,” he wrote.\n\n“Very thankful for this young Man's service and very proud of my Dad and what he does to Honor him. Love you Dad!”\nThe incredibly story quickly went viral, with many applauding the kind man for his gesture and for his unbelievably selfless heart.\n“What a wonderful man. We can all follow his example to show kindness to everyone we meet,” one reader wrote on Newsiosity’s Facebook page.\n“Beautiful story and shows he was a wonderful husband and father,” another added.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:10:11.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
