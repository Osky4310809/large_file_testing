attack reports say was perpetrated by a lone gunman who is in custody. Print Text Size People stand on the tarmac after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday, January 6, 2017. AP \nWhat we know: \n—Five people are dead and 37 were injured after someone opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, according to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. \n—The incident occurred at baggage claim in Terminal 2 of the airport. \n—A suspect is in custody. \n—This is a developing story and we’ll be following it here. All updates are in Eastern Standard Time (GMT -5). Updates Share Suspect's Brother Says He Served in National Guard, Sought Psychological Treatment \nBryan Santiago told the Associated Press that his brother, Estoban Santiago, who several news agencies have named as the suspect behind the shooting, was receiving psychological treatment in Alaska, though he said he did not know what his brother was being treated for. Santiago, according to his brother, had served in the Puerto Rican National Guard for a couple of years, and a Puerto Rico National Guard spokesman said Santiago was deployed to Iraq for a year in 2010. Florida Senator Bill Nelson said Santiago’s military ID was found on the gunman, but stopped short of confirming that the ID belonged to him. A Canadian Embassy spokeswoman said the suspect is believed to have travelled to Fort Lauderdale from Anchorage, with a transfer in Minneapolis, though it is unclear what airline the suspect used. In a press conference, Florida Governor Rick Scott said the investigation is still ongoing, and added that though he did not talk to President Obama, he did reach out to President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence.

At a news conference, he said the investigation is continuing. The shooter is unharmed, he said, and was taken into custody by a Broward County deputy without incident. He said the FBI and the Broward Sheriff’s Office (BSO) were questioning the suspect. BSO is leading the investigation, he said. Reports of a second shooting were unconfirmed, he said. “There is no active second shooter,” he said. \nGeorge Piro, the FBI special agent in charge, said it was “too early” to attribute a motive to the shooting. Mark Gale, the airport director, said operations at the airport were “suspended … for the time being.” It’s unclear, he said, when they will resume. He said everyone at the airport was sheltered in place. \nOfficials declined to comment on reports that the shooter was a passenger on an inbound flight who had checked a gun in with his luggage. \nShare More from Governor Rick Scott \nRick Scott, the Florida governor, says he is in Fort Lauderdale and has spoken to President-elect Donald Trump about the shooting at the airport. He says they spoke about “security and safety” at Florida airports.

Santiago’s name was first released by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida during an interview with MSNBC. Not much else is known about him at this time. NBC News: Multiple senior law enforcement sources say Esteban Santiago born 3/1990 is in custody. Had military ID on him. Born in NJ. Share Witness Accounts \n“At first we thought it was firecrackers,” Mark Lea, 53, told MSNBC. “Everyone started screaming and running. The shooter made his way down through baggage claim. He had what looked like a 9 mm and emptied his entire clip. People were trying to run.” \nJohn Schicher told MSNBC the gunman began firing just feet away from where he was standing with his wife and his mother-in-law. “He walked over and he was right in our area, like within just feet of us, shooting people,” he said. “I didn't know if I would be shot or if my wife or my mother-in-law would either.” Unconfirmed Reports of Additional Shots, Sheriff's Office Says Active search: Unconfirmed reports of addt'l shots fired on airport property. — Broward Sheriff (@browardsheriff) January 6, 2017 \nSuch reports often turn out to be false, and we’ll keep an eye on the situation and update it when we learn more.

The upper level of airport is open, the department added. \nThe airport tweeted the incident occurred “in Terminal 2, Baggage Claim.” Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. \nEvery day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. \nExcept, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After , which was published earlier this year. \nSocial scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Conor Friedersdorf New information on conflicts of interest that would challenge even a saint \nWells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump, according to an investigation just published by the Wall Street Journal. \nWhile the president-elect’s finances remain murky, due largely to his refusal to release his tax returns, the newspaper reports that he owes at least hundreds of millions of dollars, that the debt is held by more than 150 institutions, and that some of it is backed by his personal guarantee. “As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president,” it states. “If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as so-called special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Mr. Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump personally guaranteed on the loans.” Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. \nIn February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. \nThe cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next \nIn the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. David A. Graham Multiple agencies have confidently concluded that Russian hackers intended to hurt Clinton and help Trump, but it’s unlikely to persuade skeptics. \nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence released its most detailed report on alleged Russian hacking aimed at interfering with the presidential election on Friday. \nThe 25-page report states that the CIA, FBI, and NSA have concluded that Russia was behind a series of attacks, as well as disinformation disseminated via various media, with the goal of undermining faith in U.S. elections and harming Hillary Clinton’s presidential prospects and her prospective administration. They have concluded, however, that there was no meddling in vote tallying. \nAlthough the unclassified report, which is based on a longer, classified report, uses the strongest language and offers the most detailed assessment yet, it does not or cannot provide evidence for its assertions. That virtually guarantees that it will not change many minds in the debate, which has become heavily partisan. The intelligence community is in effect telling readers, “trust us”—something the president-elect, among others, has been unwilling to do. Paul Zak Neurochemical research has shown that the hormone released when people are in love is released in animals in the same intimate circumstances. \nI’m not a dog person. I prefer cats. Cats make you work to have a relationship with them, and I like that. But I have adopted several dogs, caving in to pressure from my kids. The first was Teddy, a rottweiler-chow mix whose bushy hair was cut into a lion mane. Kids loved him, and he grew on me, too. Teddy was probably ten years when we adopted him. Five years later he had multiple organs failing and it was time to put him to sleep. \nWhen I arrived at the vet, he said I could drop him off. I was aghast. No. I needed to stay with Teddy.As the vet prepped the syringe to put him to sleep, I started sobbing. The vet gave me a couple minutes to collect myself and say goodbye. I held Teddy's paw until he died. Honestly, I didn't think I was that attached. Megan Garber The Daily Show resurrected Luther, the character who promises to tell Americans what the president is really thinking—but gave the president himself the last word. \nThere’s perhaps been no better satire of the Obama presidency than the figure of Luther , Obama’s anger translator. Key & Peele ’s serialized sketch, in which the title character says all the things Obama won’t and can’t say as president, was multifaceted in its insights: about the performative demands of the office, about Obama’s own cool demeanor, about the collision of all those things in the person of the country’s first black president. Key & Peele ’s Luther sketches—including, and perhaps especially, the one performed with the actual President Obama, at the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner —were, in all that, as profound as they were wacky, and as much about the country Obama governed as they were about the president himself. Derek Thompson Here's an uplifting college meme that's right: The person you've become by the time you're 18 matters more than any decision by an admissions board you'll never meet. \nThis is an advice column about getting into an elite college. And, like every column about the anxiety of getting into an elite college, it must begin with a massive caveat: If you and your parents are worried about getting into an elite school, odds are that you are already elite. \nThe raw numbers are instructive. There are more than 4 million 18-year-olds in the United States. About 3.5 million of them will go to college . And just 100,000 to 150,000 of those—somewhere around 3 percent of the entire age group —go each year to selective schools that admit fewer than half of their applicants. College-admissions mania is a crisis for the 3 percent. \nThat said, the 3 percent mania is real. Hence the annual April blossoming of op-eds promising, with comforting certainty, that \"it doesn't matter where you go to college.\" That is a really nice message. It's also wrong. David A. Graham Views of the WikiLeaks founder have shifted as American partisans project their own priorities onto him. \nIt’s not that unusual for a public figure to go from hero to villain. But going from villainy to heroism? That’s a tougher road to traverse. \nJulian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and central figure, has managed to do both over the last few months, culminating in a remarkable embrace by the president-elect and two longtime critics on the American right, Sean Hannity and Sarah Palin. Over the same time, some of Assange’s erstwhile champions on the American left have drifted away, disillusioned by the way WikiLeaks attacked Hillary Clinton during the presidential election. Has Assange changed, or is his rehabilitation on the right, and his loss of esteem on the left, simply a factor of political exigencies within the United States? The answer is a little bit of both. Ronald Brownstein The roots of Russia's political appeal in Europe and the United States \nDonald Trump is practically alone in mainstream American politics in his consistent praise of Vladimir Putin and insistence that the United States would benefit from warmer relations with Russia. But that inclination to view Putin more as ally than adversary places Trump squarely in line with the racially infused, conservative-populist movements gaining ground in both America and Europe. \nAnd that means the intra-GOP friction over Russia between Trump and more traditional foreign-policy thinkers like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina points toward a much larger debate over the priorities that should drive American foreign policy. \nAcross the political spectrum, mainstream foreign-policy thinkers in both the United States and Europe view Putin as a threat largely because he is pushing to expand Russian influence across eastern Europe and the Middle East in ways that could destabilize the U.S.-led system of alliances and global rules that has defined the international order since World War II. That concern has spiked amid a succession of provocative actions from Putin, ranging from his 2014 incursion into Ukraine and brutal military campaign against anti-government rebels in Syria, to the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party email accounts to influence the 2016 American presidential election. (Trump, due to receive an intelligence briefing about those conclusions on Friday, has steadfastly resisted and belittled that conclusion.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T11:23:07.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
