King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 16 hours ago 9 Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor revealed the band's new EP \"Not the Actual Events\" was inspired by the band's older catalog, specifically the mid-'90s stuff.He told Zane Lowe (via Alternative Nation ): \"The inspiration musically came, oddly enough, from working on a project of Nine Inch Nails for something else. \"We allowed ourselves to become self-referential, look back at some of the things we've done and write a song like something else, which has never been the starting point. But it was listening back to some mid-'90s stuff that sounded pretty exciting having not listened to it in a while. 'Let's make something that is referencing that.'\"It wound up being really fun and exciting, and felt like, 'Wow, we've been restricting, there's a lot of creative avenues we didn't allow ourselves to even think about.' It felt like maybe we've done something kind of like that in our own heads.\"Having fun for a day in the studio felt very liberating, and also made me realize some of the stuff I was learning, these experiments I went on, was reactive to things that weren't necessarily that true. It was an interesting cerebral experiment to see, 'Can I emulate this trend that is happening?' It's not me, I'm not emotionally connected to it.\"You can check out the EP's lead single \"Burning Bright (Field on Fire)\" featuring Dave Navarro in the player below.
