Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAs a young person who enjoys a night out, it's a rite of passage to lose your purse or wallet and have to go through the painstaking process of cancelling all of your cards and ordering replacements. \nMost of us have to face facts and bid farewell to our Boots Advantage Points but, if you're lucky, someone will find it and get it back to you. \nWhat you don't expect is for that purse to be delivered via post with an incredibly weird note from whoever found it. \nHayley Minn, 25, from London, lost her purse on a night out when she was drunk - a standard occurrence for most young people, really. \nBut six weeks later she received it back in the post along with a note which she described as the 'creepiest ever'. \nIt began: 'Dear Miss Hayley, How are you? Hoping you will be fine and well. Hayley lost the purse on a night out with friends (Photo: Mirror Online) \n'I would like to inform you that I found your precious purse (looks like it) by Liverpool street (sic) station. Might you dropped it and looking for it.' \nThat's all polite, right? So far, so good. \nBut then it took a bit of a weird turn... He continued: \"My whole intentions to go inside your purse was to look for your address or anything which can help me to send this thing to you nothing else but I found some naughty stuff as well - don't need to feel any embracement (sic) honestly I like those people who take extra care lol.\" \n(That's condoms, for anyone who didn't get it). \n'Kindly check all your belongings and if possible do let me know via email once you received it on funny.stud@hotmail.com' \nWHAT AN E-MAIL ADDRESS. (Photo: Mirror Online) \nHe went on to promise he hadn't taken anything out of the purse and it's exactly how he found it. Obviously being accused of stealing something would have ruined his chances of a date. Here's where it gets a bit weirder... \n'Just a piece of advice kindly look after yourself and all your belongings when ou go out or allow someone else because you are one of the beautiful person I ever seen (I am sure in real you are more beautiful as compare to your picture) \n'I wish if I can take you out sometime and spend time but I am sure you will definitely have someone in your life who is taking care of you very well otherwise allow me lol :) Hayley described it as the 'creepiest note' (Photo: Hayley Minn) \n'Have a good weekend. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require anything or if you think I would be able to do anything for you. \n'Enjoy every single moment of your life and enjoy as much as you can because you never know what is going to happen next :)' poll loading What do you think of this note? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Creepy Cute \nHe signed the letter 'Your Secret Friend or Admirer lol' and included a polite instruction 'Email Friend (if you don't mind).' \nHayley says she didn't hear from 'funny stud' again. \nIt's probably for the best.
