He added that Railway work under his government was being done in ‘mission mode’. \nModi was accompanied by Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. \n“Railway samanya jan se judi hui vyavastha hai..Lekin durbhagya se Railway ko uske naseeb par chhod diya gaya. Aur gat 30 varsh me, khas karke jab ki mili-jhuli sarkare rehti thi, usme ek tarah se jo sathi dal rehte the ve tab mantri-parishad me judte the, ya sarkar ko samarthan dete the, agar unhe Rail mantralay mile to (Railways is associated with the common people.Unfortunately, it was left to its fate. And in the last 30 years, particularly when coalition governments were there, a coalition partner would join the council of ministers or support the government, if they were given the Railway portfolio),” said Modi. \nThis led to Railways being ignored by successive governments, he said. His government has given priority to Railways, Modi said, adding that in the last over two years they had doubled the Railway budget. \nModi said his government was working in ‘mission mode’ to develop Railways thoroughly on issues like safety, sanitation, environment and cargo. “In the world, 70 per cent cargo is being transported through rail. Whereas in India, only 15-20 per cent cargo is being transported by rail. Work to increase cargo through railways is on,” he added. \nRedevelopment of Gandhinagar Railway Station is one of the projects initiated by the Union government in collaboration with the state government.
