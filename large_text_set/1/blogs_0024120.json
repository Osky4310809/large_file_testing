These are the resources, the publications, the articles, the essential tools, the resistance squads, the warriors both veteran and upstart, each and every one dedicated to fighting the Trumpocalypse and advocating for human rights, civil liberties, the safety and dignity of immigrants, minorities and refugees, of the LGBT community, of women’s health, science, the arts, sanctuary, your own tremulous and terrified heart. Also hope, kindness and just the type of fundamental human decency that was spit upon and stomped to the ground on November 8th.\nAnd let’s be absolutely clear: This is the time. It is, tragically and rather gruesomely, unlike any time in recent U.S. history, as the world bears sickened witness to America’s sudden lurch toward tyranny, toward a flatulent fascism like we’ve never really known, a complete upheaval and molestation of America’s truest values. \nThe assaults are coming fast and vicious. We are no longer a full democracy . It does not matter if you’re working-class or “elite,” midwestern or coastal, Repub or Dem, blue or red or anything in between: Trump means everyone ill. \nI realize the following list might seem overwhelming. You must take sufficient time to filter, to pore through, to see where you can engage most successfully. Meditation helps tremendously. And yoga . And reconnecting with your immediate community, your loved ones, your local kula. Also, bourbon. Also, nature. Also, compassion. Raging, outraged, middle-finger compassion. You know the kind? \nDo you have the time for any of this? Of course you do. You must have the time. You cannot be too busy. Not anymore. You cannot be too stressed or tired or “just not feeling it,” meekly hoping someone else will fix it all for you, will defend you and your family, your kids, your gay/black/Islamic/Latino/feminist/scientific/ journalist friends, against Trump’s radioactive, sociopathic hatestorm. There is simply too much at stake. Paige Carmichael, 6, from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, participates in the Women's March on Washington, following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, in Washington, D.C. Meet the near future. She will eat megalomaniacal, tiny-handed Trump-trolls like a goddamn Kraft Lunchable. \nKnow this: There is tremendous power in unity. The awe-inspiring Women’s March revealed a global wellspring of fiery, compassionate solidary the likes of which the world hasn’t seen in decades, if ever. It was downright breathtaking. In short: The raw engine for real progress is there. And you are the fuel. \nDoes that sound cheesy? I don’t care. Do it anyway. \n( Caveat : This list is, naturally, by no means complete, nor is it intended to be so. I leave it to those who create/operate these resources to spur you to more specific actions, the most effective ways to use your energy, time and money. Read thoroughly. Dig deep. Add your own orgs and sites and methods. , both local and national, and I’ll add them to the list. We are in this fight together). \nStart with: \nScientists march on Washington ( Facebook / email updates ) Smart people are dangerous. If tyranny is to succeed, smart people and their books, science, know-how, college degrees and clever ideas to keep us all alive must be shut down in favor of 5th-grade gruntspeak and “alternative facts.” This is the Trump ethos. \nAlready, a new march has been planned (date TBA) in defiance of Trump’s unprecedented crackdown on the EPA, on climate science, the USDA, HHS, all communications from national parks, threats against NASA, et al. \nDon’t f-ck with science, Orange Monster. They know how you breathe. Get your clever signs ready. \nJoin, donate, support, participate Set up automatic monthly donations. Get their newsletters. Attend local chapter meetings. Note actionable items on their websites. The ACLU alone is gathering a Constitutional Defense Fund to battle Trump’s vicious attacks and needs immediate financial help. Flip them $10 a month? Planned Parenthood has never been under such scathing duress from the gleefully misogynistic GOP. They can tell you who to call, right now. There are multiple ways you can help. \nThese are some of the larger, most essential groups doing some of the most vital work (bonus: many supported/co-sponsored the Women’s March).
