It was the recipe that would propel Mimi Thorisson’s rise from blogger to cookbook writer and, later, the host of a popup bistro and cookery workshops at her restored château in rural south-west France. ‘Ever since I moved from Paris to the countryside it was my dream to run a little restaurant, but I had no idea where to do it,’ Thorisson tells me. \nAfter four years in Médoc, she and her husband, Oddur, a photographer, chanced upon a tumbledown château in 2014, with room enough for their large family and many dogs, as well as for her imagined tables d’hôte. Mimi and some of her children return with freshly baked baguettes Credit: Oddur Thorisson \nA s wallpaper was stripped and the kitchen was revived, the house revealed its story: once a hotel, it still held the owner’s recipes and cookbooks, ‘even the menus for her restaurant’, and the Thorissons preserved ‘as much of its history as possible’. \nThey welcomed guests (fans of the blog, Manger , and of her first cookbook ), from places as far-flung as Chile and Singapore, to feast at their new home, as well as hosting cookery class - es. ‘I still remember the first one I ran,’ Thorisson says. ‘I saw the people outside and thought, I have no clue what to do! Oddur said, “Just do what you always do – cook.”’ \nAnd so she did, as well as taking her visitors to the local market, cycling to vine - yards, hunting for antiques and running photography lessons. The workshops continue seasonally (‘We always cook together and there is always wine – lots of wine’), and Thorisson even exported her pop-up to Paris. ‘We have been so busy,’ she says. Mimi Thorisson with some vegetables from the garden Credit: Oddur Thorisson \nA vegetable garden has been cultivated, too, bearing 40 crates of ‘amazingly sweet, meaty’ tomatoes last year, enjoyed while Thorisson wrote her second book. French Country Cooking , from where these exclusive recipes (below) come, tells the story of her house and its latest incarnation as a hub of enchanting food. \n‘Last night I cooked quails wrapped in bacon, using the Jura-wine gravy from a previous roast, and put the last of the pumpkins into a soup with sage and beurre noisette.’ \nA third book, in which Thorisson hopes to explore her Chinese roots and those of her Icelandic husband, has already been conceived. ‘I am always inspired,’ she says. ‘It comes from an enthusiasm for eating well. And I’ve found my perfect setting.’ Beetroot salad with crème fraîche Credit: Oddur Thorisson 2 medium beetroots, peeled and very thinly sliced ½ large head red cabbage, cored and very thinly sliced 3 red endives or 2 small Treviso radicchios, leaves separated 1 large red onion, thinly sliced seeds from 1 large pomegranate 60g pumpkin seeds, lightly toasted leaves from a few sprigs of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 1 tbsp drained capers 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil grated zest and juice of 1 lemon 120ml crème fraîche METHOD In a medium bowl, combine the beetroots, cabbage, endives or radicchios, onion, pomegranate seeds, pumpkin seeds, parsley and capers. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle over the salad and toss everything together. Serve on plates, topped with the crème fraîche and lemon zest. Quail millefeuille Credit: Oddur Thorisson \nA n easy dish that just sounds complicated, which works in your favour when you serve it to guests. SERVES 4 quails extra-virgin olive oil, for cooking 1 medium onion, diced 1 small carrot, peeled and diced 1 bouquet garni 75g unsalted butter, plus 30g, melted, for the pastry pinch of Rabelais spice or allspice ½ head savoy cabbage, sliced into strips 4 potatoes, peeled and very thinly sliced, preferably using a mandolin 5 sheets frozen filo pastry, thawed 2 tbsp red wine 1 bunch of spring onions (4-5), white and green parts, thinly sliced 1 bunch of fresh chives, finely chopped METHOD Cut the quail breasts off the bones and cut off the legs. Chop the carcases into chunks. In a large pan, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over a medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and quail carcase pieces and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Season lightly. Add the bouquet garni, nutmeg and enough water to just cover. Cover the pan and simmer over a medium-low heat for at least 45 minutes and up to 1 hour 30 minutes, as time allows. Uncover and boil the quail stock over a high heat until you have about 180ml. Meanwhile, in a sauté pan, heat 15g of the butter over a medium heat. Season the quail breasts and legs with salt and pepper and the Rabelais or allspice. Add to the pan and cook until golden on each side, a few minutes per side. The meat should be very rare at this point as you want it to stay tender and keep all its juices. Set aside to cool, then slice the breast meat thinly, and, with a fork, remove all the meat from the legs. Melt 30g of the butter in the pan over a medium heat. Add the cabbage, season with salt, and sauté for 3 minutes; it will still be slightly crunchy. Set aside in a bowl. In the same pan, heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan over a medium heat. Working in batches and adding oil as needed, cook the potatoes until golden on both sides, 1-2 minutes per side. Season with salt. Set aside on kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil. Preheat the oven to 180C/ gas mark 4. Lightly brush each pastry sheet with melted butter. Cut out 20 rounds about 11.5cm in diameter. Strain the quail stock into a small saucepan (discard the solids). Bring to the boil over a high heat. Add the wine and continue to boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the remaining 30g of butter, and whisk constantly until the butter is melted and the sauce has thickened. Season to taste. Line a rimmed baking tray with baking parchment. Put four rounds of filo on the sheet, topping each with a layer of potatoes. Continue with a layer of quail, cabbage, and a few slices of spring onion. Repeat to make four layers per serving, ending with the last filo rounds on top. Brush with melted butter. Bake until the pastry is golden and everything is hot, 8-10 minutes. To serve, drizzle the sauce around each one and sprinkle with chives and any remaining spring onion.
