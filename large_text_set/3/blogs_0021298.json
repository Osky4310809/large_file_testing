Despite the fact that income has increased in the U.S. over the past decade, the country’s happiness is declining — so it looks like the old adage that money can’t buy you happiness is more than just a platitude.\n“It’s the human things that matter. If the riches make it harder to have frequent and trustworthy relationships between people, is it worth it?” asked the report’s author, John Helliwell. “The material can stand in the way of the human.” Maybe it’s the view? #Norway is the world’s happiest country, according to the newly released World Happiness Report. Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, and Finland round out the top five.

I don’t think Denmark has a monopoly on happiness,” said Meik Wiking, chief executive officer of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen. “What works in the Nordic countries is a sense of community and understanding in the common good.” W O W, this is the northernmost city of N O R W A Y!

My kind of beach and two minutes of sun yesterday. There is certainly no time to be bored in such a beautiful world. Thank you @hattvikalodge for keeping us warm in these stormy days #keepcalmandlovenorthernnorway \nA post shared by Martina Gebarovska (@dreamingandwandering) on Mar 20, 2017 at 8:49am PDT \nThe report is based on the answers of participants in 155 countries who ranked their homeland on a scale of one to 10 on a variety of factors including how much social support they feel they have, their freedom to make their own life choices, their sense of how corrupt their society is, and how generous they are.\nWhile most countries are getting happier, America’s happiness score has declined by five percent over the past decade. Jeffrey Sachs, the study’s co-author, says that strength of community is declining in the U.S.\n“We’re becoming more and more mean-spirited. And our government is becoming more and more corrupt. And inequality is rising,” he told Cosmopolitan . “It’s a long-term trend and conditions are getting worse.” Helliwell added that happiness and doing what you love are more important than politicians think. Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Finland, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden rounded out the top 10.
