Everyone from Scorsese to Aronofsky has cultivated their talent through hard work and inspiration from other artists, and director Wes Anderson, as quirky and unique as he might be, is no different. In this supercut by Candice Drouet , we get to see how directors like Stanley Kubrick and the British filmmaking duo, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, inspired Anderson's visual style in a side-by-side comparison of 20 visual references has admittedly made in his films. \nIt's interesting to see the many different places from which Anderson says he drew inspiration. Hitchcock's The 39 Steps , David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia , and Ken Loach's Kes are all very different films, but all managed to find their way into the director's mind while he made his own . \nBut apart from enjoying the sheer thrill of trivia, this supercut is great in that it demonstrates how great filmmakers take inspiration from everything and anywhere. It's not just about watching films and seeing how your favorite filmmakers lit a scene, dressed a set, or composed a shot, it's also about being present in your own life and being observant in your own world. I mean, if Anderson can be inspired by a bottle of Polish vodka, I think we can all find our own inspiration just about anywhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:08:58.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
