He continues to forcefully grab people’s undeveloped property,” Olokobi lamented. \nWhen contacted, Osuolale said an agreement was signed between the community and his company in 2016 at the instance of the Ojon of Ejigbo and Ijanland, Oba Moroof Adekunle Ojoola as the mediator. \nHe advised the property owners to honour the agreement to ratify their property on or before the expiration of the deadline to avoid the demolition of their properties. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:10:59.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
