Brendan Steele is currently tied for third place at this weekend’s Phoenix Open , but that’s not important right now. What is important is Steele was acknowledged by a fan(?) or his son who yelled out “Steele fucked my mom” right after Brendan tee’d off. \nSuch a more entertaining and intimate shout than “mashed potatoes.”\nGod bless this man for his originality and his dedication to drinking during PGA events. \nI imagine the heckler will not be shouting “get in the hole!” after Mr. Steele Your Mom tees off. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:34:32.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
