They played their last game ever in the Georgia Dome, but Sunday’s game wasn’t technically their last home game of the season. They will be the home team in Houston on Feb. 5 when they play the AFC Championship winner between the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots. \nThe team designated as the home team in the Super Bowl alternates between the AFC and NFC every year . Last year, the AFC champion Denver Broncos were “at home” when they beat the Carolina Panthers. The designation is largely symbolic. \nThe home team gets one advantage, however: It gets to choose whether it wears white or colored uniforms. Teams that wear white have been much more successful in the Super Bowl. All-time, the white team has an overall 32-18 record, and has won 11 of the past 12 matchups. The last team to wear a colored jersey and win the Super Bowl was the Green Bay Packers six years ago against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV.\nThe Falcons are flying high off two straight dominating offensive and defensive performances. They may not need the luck, but just in case they should probably keep their usual home uniforms in their lockers.
