This is because, every government, according to Soludo, has promised to move away from depending on oil for revenue but have failed to do so. \nWhile talking on transitional plans from sole dependence on oil to other sources of revenue, Professor Soludo asked, “Is it a plan to post-oil economy that Nigeria has been waiting for? Whose plan is it? Ownership would determine if the plan is just a public relations plan or a national plan.” \n“At what rate is the Economic Recovery Growth Plan ERGP consistent with the APC manifesto? \nThe APC manifesto promised a conscious plan for post-oil economy in Nigeria. \nTo achieve this, APC shall restructure the country” \nWhat has changed? The rapid accumulation of foreign reserves depletion was not an accident. \nThere are no projection for exchange rate overhaul in the APC plan. \nThe IMF complained that naira was undervalued and pressured. \nNominal exchange rate would have been at 70 to 80 naira to the dollar if we had not maintained an under-valued naira – said Soludo. \nI can bet that not much would happen at the end of plan in terms of restructuring of the economy – Soludo. \nExtended ERGP or ERGP plus-plus. \nNo doubt, the fg means well for Nigeria but the road to hell is always filled with good intentions. \nWhat Nigeria needs at this time is statesmanship politics – Soludo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T13:27:20.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
