Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Collection Updated February 28, 2017 . \nFew people today have even heard of the Battle of Talas River. Yet this little-known skirmish between the army of Imperial Tang China and the Abbasid Arabs had important consequences, not just for China and Central Asia, but for the entire world. \nEighth century Asia was an ever-shifting mosaic of different tribal and regional powers, fighting for trade rights, political power and/or religious hegemony. The era was characterized by a dizzying array of battles, alliances, double-crosses and betrayals. \nAt the time, nobody could have known that one particular battle, which took place on the banks of the Talas River in present-day Kyrgyzstan , would halt the Arab and Chinese advances in Central Asia and fix the boundary between Buddhist/Confucianist Asia and Muslim Asia. \ncontinue reading below our video 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance \nNone of the combatants could have predicted that this battle would be instrumental in transmitting a key invention from China to the western world: the art of paper-making, a technology that would alter world history forever. Background to the Battle \nFor some time, the powerful Tang Empire (618-906) and its predecessors had been expanding Chinese influence in Central Asia. \nChina used \"soft power\" for the most part, relying upon a series of trade agreements and nominal protectorates rather than military conquest to control Central Asia. The most troublesome foe faced by the Tang from 640 forward was the powerful Tibetan Empire , established by Songtsan Gampo. \nControl of what is now Xinjiang , Western China, and neighboring provinces went back and forth between China and Tibet throughout the seventh and eighth centuries. China also faced challenges from the Turkic Uighurs in the northwest, the Indo-European Turfans, and the Lao/Thai tribes on China's southern borders. The Rise of the Arabs \nWhile the Tang were occupied with all these adversaries, a new superpower rose in the Middle East. \nThe Prophet Muhammad died in 632, and the Muslim faithful under the Umayyad Dynasty (661-750) soon brought vast areas under their sway. From Spain and Portugal in the west, across North Africa and the Middle East, and on to the oasis cities of Merv, Tashkent, and Samarkand in the east, the Arab conquest spread with astonishing speed. \nChina's interests in Central Asia went back at least to 97 B.C., when the Han Dynasty general Ban Chao led an army of 70,000 as far as Merv (in what is now Turkmenistan ), in pursuit of bandit tribes that preyed on early Silk Road caravans. \nChina also had long courted trade relations with the Sassanid Empire in Persia, as well as their predecessors the Parthians . The Persians and Chinese had collaborated to quell rising Turkic powers, playing different tribal leaders off of one another. \nIn addition, the Chinese had a long history of contacts with the Sogdian Empire, centered in modern-day Uzbekistan . Early Chinese/Arab Conflicts \nInevitably, the lightning-quick expansion by the Arabs would clash with China's established interests in Central Asia. \nIn 651, the Umayyads captured the Sassanian capital at Merv and executed the king, Yazdegard III. From this base, they would go on to conquer Bukhara, the Ferghana Valley, and as far east as Kashgar (on the Chinese/Kyrgyz border today). \nNews of Yazdegard's fate was carried to the Chinese capital of Chang'an (Xian) by his son Firuz, who fled to China after the fall of Merv. Firuz later became a general of one of China's armies, and then governor of a region centered at modern-day Zaranj, Afghanistan . \nIn 715, the first armed clash between the two powers occurred in the Ferghana Valley of Afghanistan. \nThe Arabs and Tibetans deposed King Ikhshid and installed a man named Alutar in his place. Ikhshid asked China to intervene on his behalf, and the Tang sent an army of 10,000 to overthrow Alutar and reinstate Ikhshid. \nTwo years later, an Arab/Tibetan army besieged two cities in the Aksu region of what is now Xinjiang, western China. The Chinese sent an army of Qarluq mercenaries, who defeated the Arabs and Tibetans and lifted the siege. \nIn 750 the Umayyad Caliphate fell, overthrown by the more aggressive Abbasid Dynasty. The Abbasids \nFrom their first capital at Harran, Turkey , the Abbasid Caliphate set out to consolidate power over the sprawling Arab Empire built by the Umayyads. One area of concern was the eastern borderlands - the Ferghana Valley and beyond. \nThe Arab forces in eastern Central Asia with their Tibetan and Uighur allies were led by the brilliant tactician, General Ziyad ibn Salih. China's western army was headed by Governor-General Kao Hsien-chih (Go Seong-ji), an ethnic-Korean commander. (It was not unusual at that time for foreign or minority officers to command Chinese armies because the military was considered an undesirable career path for ethnic Chinese noblemen.) \nAppropriately enough, the decisive clash at Talas River was precipitated by another dispute in Ferghana. \nIn 750, the king of Ferghana had a border dispute with the ruler of neighboring Chach. He appealed to the Chinese, who sent General Kao to assist Ferghana's troops. \nKao besieged Chach, offered the Chachan king safe passage out of his capital, then reneged and beheaded him. In a mirror-image parallel to what had happened during the Arab conquest of Merv in 651, the Chachan king's son escaped and reported the incident to Abbasid Arab governor Abu Muslim at Khorasan. \nAbu Muslim rallied his troops at Merv and marched to join Ziyad ibn Salih's army further east. The Arabs were determined to teach General Kao a lesson... and incidentally, to assert Abbasid power in the region. The Battle of Talas River \nIn July of 751, the armies of these two great empires met at Talas, near the modern-day Kyrgyz/Kazakh border. \nChinese records state that the Tang army was 30,000 strong, while Arab accounts put the number of Chinese at 100,000. The total number of Arab, Tibetan and Uighur warriors is not recorded, but theirs was the larger of the two forces.
