Making Nutella without palm oil would produce an inferior substitute for the real product Vincenzo Tapella, Ferrero Purchasing Manager \nOther substitutes, such as sunflower oil, would change its character, according to Ferrero. \n“Making Nutella without palm oil would produce an inferior substitute for the real product, it would be a step backward,” Ferrero's purchasing manager Vincenzo Tapella said. \nAny move away from palm oil would also have economic implications as it is the cheapest vegetable oil, costing around $800 a tonne, compared with $845 for sunflower oil and $920 for rapeseed oil, another possible substitute. \nIn the nutritional information on it's website, Nutella reveals that each 15g tablespoon of the spread contains 8.5g of sugar - which means that each 400g jar contains a whopping 227.2g. Getty Images Nutella is a popular treat with children and adults alike \nThat works out as 75 three gram sugar cubes per jar - and makes up more than half of the jar's weight. \nExpress.co.uk have contacted Nutella for comment. In a statement to Mail Online regarding the viral image, Nutella said: \"We don’t disclose the full proportions of the ingredients in Nutella as our recipe is unique and we wish to safeguard this. \n\"The product’s label provides simple and clear nutritional information per 15g portion, or two heaped teaspoons, as well as per 100g. The ingredients are also listed on the Nutella website.\" \nFerrero said: \"One of Ferrero’s core nutritional beliefs is that small portion sizes help people to enjoy their favourite foods in moderation. The labelling on our products enables consumers to make informed choices and helps ensure that Nutella can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.\" \nOf the cancer scare, they said: \"The health and safety of consumers is an absolute and first priority for Ferrero and we confirm that Ferrero products are safe. \n\"The EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) has analysed the presence of contaminants in a large number of products and oils stating that the presence of contaminants depends on the oils and fats used as well as the processes they are subjected to. \n\"It is for this reason that Ferrero carefully selects quality raw materials and applies specific industrial processes that limit their presence to minimum levels, fully in line with the parameters defined by the EFSA. In addition, our auality teams constantly monitor such factors and guarantee the food safety of our products to the consumer.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T13:11:05.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
