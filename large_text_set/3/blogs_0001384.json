What is this, 1999? While it really is an intriguing case, Nokia had a few other devices that also deserve their fair share of attention - the Nokia 6, 5, and 3 completed the company's strong presence at the trade show. The Nokia 3 also garnered a lot of attention mostly because of its quite affordable projected price of âŹ139, the European equivalent of $146. You get what you pay for: a 5-inch device with a 720p HD display, a humble MediaTek chipset ticking alongside 2 gigs of RAM, 16 gigs of storage, a 2,650mAh battery, and finally, 8MP cameras up front and at the rear. You don't need to be that special to take adequate pictures Both cameras are boasting autofocus capabilities and large apertures of f/2; the front snapper also offers a field of view of 84 degrees, making it great for group selfies. There's nothing terribly special about either camera on the Nokia 3, but this doesn't mean they are bad.... Actually, they fare pretty well if the lighting conditions are favorable, and in spite that they're far from perfect when it comes to detail reproduction, they make the Nokia 3 a perfectly capable camera phone. Here are a couple of camera samples that will show you how the main and front snappers fare.
