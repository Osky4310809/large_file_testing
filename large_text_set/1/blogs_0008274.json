In commemoration, iFixit has published a roundup of 15 iPhone teardowns the site has completed over the past decade, offering a look at how the design's construction has evolved over time. In contrast to Apple's iMac s and MacBooks which have become progressively more difficult to repair in recent years, the iPhone's repairability score has fared a lot better after quickly improving upon its first incarnation, as noted by iFixit. iFixit's teardown of the first-generation iPhone iPhones have become taller, wider, and skinnier. But theyâve also become more repairable. The very first iPhone earned a dismal 2/10 on our repairability scale. It had a soldered battery and was almost impossible to open without breaking the case. Repairability improved radically from there â jumping to a 7/10 for the iPhone 3G. Since then, the company's flagship smartphone has remained relatively repair-friendly, earning at least 6/10 on iFixit's repairability rating with every iteration. The most recent iPhone offering, the iPhone 7 , was awarded 7/10 on the scale in 2016. Check out the \"10 Years of iPhone\" roundup page on iFixit , which also features a neat look at the visual changes the components have undergone over 15 models.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T12:13:54.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
