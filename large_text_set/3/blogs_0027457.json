However steady the progress, selling out a 30,000-seat StubHub Center has been a process unlike what the Rams experienced when making their Los Angeles return in 2016. \nThe Rams sold all 70,000 of their season tickets in six hours . \nThe Chargers have taken longer to sell less. \nThey began accepting $100 refundable deposits on Jan. 12 and announced season-ticket prices on Feb. 14 . They opened business to existing season-ticket holders (those from Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego) on Feb. 22 and to other customers on March 9, a club source said Thursday evening. So, it’s been two weeks since the public sale opened. \nThis was never a competition with the Rams. The Chargers know what they’re up against in a new market. \nTheir team slogan, “Fight for L.A.,” was chosen for a reason.
