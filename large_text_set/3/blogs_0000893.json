Officials at the border are thieves. We spent N125,000 to cross into the country despite having all our complete documents. If they take a look at your passport, you must give them money to get it back. I have not seen that kind of thing in my life. \n“I think all the thieves congregate in the Nigerian border. From the closest Togo to Benin border posts, there was no problem. The Nigerian end of the Nigeria/Benin border is full of crooks. Something needs to be done.” \nMcKinney said they were, however, excited to be in Nigeria despite being warned not to come. \nHe explained that they had come to Nigeria to carry out medical expedition to treat dysentery in some remote villages in Cross River State. \n“We are excited to be in Nigeria. Although we were warned not to come, I must state that the people are nice, even the security officials at the checkpoints within the country,” he said. \nWhen contacted, the Service Public Relations Officer of the NIS, Mr. S. James, requested further details from the tourists so as to properly address the matter. \nJames said, “We would like them to give us details because it is this kind of information that will assist us to clear the rot in the system. This kind of experience is not good for the service. We need to portray a good image of the country at all entry points.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:09:21.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
