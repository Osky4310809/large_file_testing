If someone compares me to him, it's an honour.\" \nNasri was seen as having the potential to become one of the best deep-lying midfielders in the world when he was at Marseille, but he insists he has always felt more comfortable playing in a more advanced role. \n\"I didn't want to be the 'No.6 of tomorrow' because there were players who played the role before me who did great things. I was better suited to pushing forward than a classic No. 6. \nGiroud goal was unbelievable but lucky, says Koscielny \n\"Today, I play as a box-to-box No. 8 and it gives me pleasure.\" \nNasri has scored three goals in 15 games in all competitions for Sevilla this term, who sit second in La Liga and face leaders Real Madrid in Thursday's Copa del Rey encounter before taking them on again in La Liga on Sunday.
