The company will be retrenching workers to stay afloat. Picture: Siyanda Mayeza Related Articles SA slaps huge import tax on EU chicken legs \nJohannesburg - Government departments and South Africa’s poultry producers will meet in the next few weeks in a last-ditch bid to save the country’s chicken industry. \nThe sector is on the verge of collapse as it battles with a flood of cheap chicken quarters that are allegedly being dumped by EU countries and the US. \nThe move comes as several of the country’s biggest chicken producers, including KwaZulu-Natal’s iconic Rainbow Chickens, push ahead with mass retrenchments and farm sell-offs, which will see Rainbow alone cutting more than 1 350 jobs at the end of this month. \nKevin Lovell, chairperson of the SA Poultry Association, told City Press on Friday that government, led by the department of trade and industry (the dti), had committed to a summit aimed at keeping the industry alive. \n“Government – not just the dti – has understood that urgent and comprehensive action is required. \nWe are meeting in the near future to look at finding a solution for the current crisis and to stabilise the industry in its short- and medium-term future,” Lovell said. \n“Government understands that we are at a South African textile industry moment, where shrinkage caused by cheap imports became permanent, that we are about to fail rather than contemplating failure,” he said. THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE COPING WITH THE REAL PAIN OF JOBLESSNESS \nGodfrey Mtshali’s face starts to twitch as he describes his daily task of counselling his colleagues at Rainbow Chickens who will lose their jobs at the end of this month. \nThe 57-year-old father of three university-going children is an employee relations specialist, so despite the fact that he is going to lose the job he took up seven years ago when he moved from Tiger Brands, Mtshali has to hold it together and help his colleagues prepare for life in the unemployment line. \nOn January 31, a total of 1355 Rainbow employees will be retrenched as the company sells off 15 of its 35 farms in Camperdown and Hammarsdale, western Durban, in the face of daily losses of R1million caused by a glut of cheap imported chicken dumped on South Africa. \n“It’s difficult,” says Mtshali. “I have to deal with my own emotions and keep them under control while counselling my colleagues. At least I have the training for it, but it is difficult.” \nMtshali and his colleagues had a bleak Christmas as they were informed of the retrenchment process late last year. \n“The announcement hit us like a bomb,” he recalls. \n“As a father you are expected to provide. I have three children at university and have to find a means to ensure that their education continues. \n\"How can you tell your child that you cannot go back to school,” he says. \nAgnes Wanda (54), who has been working at Rainbow for 31 years, is also one of those who will lose their livelihoods on January 31. \nWanda is a “scaler” on the Rainbow production line, weighing 2kg lots of chicken for packing, and has worked at the company for her entire career. \n“I’m afraid about what is going to happen,” says Wanda, whose wages support seven people. \n“I don’t know how we are going to afford to live. When I told them at home, they were so scared and frustrated because the young people don’t have jobs and can’t do anything about the situation,” she says. \nSean Petit, managing director of Rainbow Chickens’ consumer division, said this week that they had to make the cuts for the company to survive. \n“We have to sell half our farms and 1355 of our people will lose their jobs. We can’t just keep on waiting for government to intervene,” he said. “There is no going back on this decision. These farms are being sold for commercial purposes and these jobs are gone forever.” \nLovell said that last year around R7 billion worth of imported chicken-leg quarters – which are dumped by European companies because consumers there only eat breasts and wings – came through Durban harbour at a cost of R10/kg – half the industry standard price. \n“This is such a waste. This R7 billion could have stayed in South Africa and supported the local industry,” he said. \nLovell said poultry producers would ask government to introduce regulations that would in effect halve the amount of chicken entering South Africa as this was the minimum requirement for the local industry to survive. \n“The outcome of the meeting will have to cut imports dramatically, by 50% or more. We are flexible about how we achieve this, and are hopeful that government will be equally flexible,” Lovell said. \n“There is no such thing as cheap food if you don’t have a job. If the industry is stabilised and the imports are stopped, we can not only save existing jobs, but also create 50 000 direct and indirect jobs, which is 5% of government’s target, with the right support and intervention,” said Lovell. \n“None of this can happen if so many participants in the industry are in give-up mode. The jobs that are being lost are gone forever. The farms that are being sold will never be used for farming again,” Lovell said. \nThe potential collapse of the poultry industry also holds serious implications for soya bean farmers – 90% of whose produce is consumed by chicken producers – and for maize growers, as poultry is South Africa’s second-largest maize consumer after the human market. \nSpokesperson for the dti Sidwell Medupe said that a committee comprising the dti, the agriculture ministry and other players would meet to look at how to address the problems the industry was facing. \nMedupe said this committee would “consider all the challenges experienced by the domestic poultry industry and develop a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges in a holistic and sustainable manner”.
