You can try stenciling a small heart into your eye shadow, or drawing a small one with liquid liner at the corner or under your eyes, or go all out with heart shaped lipstick a la the Red Queen in Alice In Wonderland . Golden lips A photo posted by KIM TER STEGE (@kimterstege) on Jan 25, 2017 at 2:32pm PST \nBefore you freak out, golden lips can be done in a very subtle way as well. Play around with some rose gold lipsticks or glosses, building up colour as much as you're comfortable; or try a swipe of sheer golden gloss over your regular lip colour, and you're good to go. Peach-ish or apricot blush A photo posted by Makeup Paola g (@makeuppaolag) on Jan 15, 2017 at 12:59pm PST \nGo soft with your blush this year, with soft, peach toned blushes to add a hint of colour. But don't go overboard. Glossy lips A photo posted by ¡MISS VZLA STYLE PANAMÁ! (@missvenezuelastyle) on Jan 24, 2017 at 10:58am PST \nOut with the matte, in with the glosses this Valentine's Day. Opt for sheer pinkish glosses, or even one with glitter, if you're feeling fancy. Coloured eyes A photo posted by Debasree Banerjee (@debasreee) on Feb 8, 2017 at 11:26pm PST \nWhether you opt for full on coloured shadow, or a coloured liner to line your upper or lower lash line, don't be afraid to embrace the rainbow this Valentine's Day. Big lashes A photo posted by Lakmé Fashion Week (@lakmefashionwk) on Feb 4, 2017 at 11:42pm PST \nNothing says romantic like a set of super long fluttery lashes. So whether you use falsies, or are blessed with the perfect set of lashes, get your mascara on, and test your flutter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T11:46:11.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
