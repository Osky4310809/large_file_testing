You don’t absolutely need one to get through the day, and some of the best smartwatches are much too expensive for many folks out there. With that said, they are good for a lot of things. They can provide you with an easy way to get information, allow you to dismiss or reply to new messages without having to pull out your phone, and much more.\nBest Android phones Best Android Wear watches Now, we’ve already rounded up some of the best Android Wear watches and fitness trackers you can buy, but what about the other wearables that are worth considering? With so many smartwatches on the market, we understand choosing the right one can be a bit daunting. We’re here to help!\nHere are the best smartwatches you can buy right now.\nEditor’s note: We’ll be updating this list regularly as new devices launch. LG Watch Sport \nSee more LG Watch Sport photos \nAlongside the launch of Android Wear 2.0 , Google and LG took the wraps off two new smartwatches to showcase the big update. The higher-end of the two is the LG Watch Sport, and it’s currently the best smartwatch you can buy right now.\nThe Watch Sport has basically every feature you’d want in a smartwatch – a big AMOLED display, built-in GPS, an optical heart rate monitor, LTE connectivity, an IP68 water resistance rating, as well as support for Android Pay. The main button on the right side of the device also acts as a way to scroll through menus in Android Wear, which allows for a much faster and more robust navigation experience.\nIt’s a bit pricey at $349, but we think it’s worth the money. If you’re interested in learning more, be sure to check out our LG Watch Sport review attached below.\nSpecs 1.38-inch POLED with 480 x 480 resolution, 348ppi Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor 768MB of RAM 4GB of on-board storage 420mAh battery 45.4 x 51.21 x 14.2mm, 89.4g IP68 dust and water resistance Read more LG Watch Sport and Watch Style review LG Watch Sport and Watch Style specs, price and release date Where to buy the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Buy now from the Google Store LG Watch Style \nSee more LG Watch Style photos \nAs previously mentioned, the LG Watch Style was also unveiled alongside Android Wear 2.0. It’s not as feature packed as the Watch Sport, but it’s still a great option if you’re looking for a cheaper, less bulky smartwatch running Android Wear 2.0.\nUnlike the Sport model, the Watch Style does not feature NFC for mobile payments, nor does it come with a built-in GPS, LTE connectivity or a heart rate sensor. While those omissions might seem like a big deal for some people, it’s worth noting that not everyone wants a big, bulky watch with a ton of features. The LG Watch Style is just that – a stylish, well-performing showcase for Android Wear 2.0 that doesn’t try to do too much. It’s a great smartwatch, and one you should definitely consider if the current crop of Android Wear devices are just too big for your wrists.\nSpecs 1.2-inch POLED with 360 x 360 resolution, 299ppi Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor 512MB of RAM 4GB of on-board storage 240mAh battery 42.3 x 45.7 x 10.79mm, 46g IP67 dust and water resistance Read more LG Watch Sport and Watch Style review LG Watch Sport and Watch Style specs, price and release date Where to buy the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Buy now from the Google Store Samsung Gear S3 \nSee more Gear S3 photos \nSamsung’s Gear S2 smartwatch from 2015 was a very impressive offering, and now the company is back with yet another pair of Tizen-powered smartwatches, the Gear S3 Classic and Gear S3 Frontier! Featuring the same great rotating bezel, an all-new design and many more enhancements, these new wearables are definitely a step in the right direction.\nWhether you’re looking for a more classy or sporty look, the Gear S3 line probably has something for you. The Classic model is geared towards folks who want to wear their watch to work or out on the town. It should be noted that the Classic version does not come with LTE connectivity, though, so you’ll need to be paired with a smartphone if you want to receive notifications on your wrist. If you’re looking for something a bit more rugged that features LTE connectivity, the Frontier version is the watch for you. Both models also come with an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, as well as big 380mAh batteries and 1.3-inch Super AMOLED displays.\nSpecs Samsung Gear S3 Classic \n1.3-inch Super AMOLED display with 360 x 360 resolution, 278ppi 1.0GHz dual-core Samsung Exynos 7270 768MB of RAM 4GB of on-board storage 380mAh battery Tizen 49 x 46 x 12.9mm, 59g IP68 dust and water resistance rating Samsung Gear S3 Frontier (LTE) \n1.3-inch Super AMOLED display with 360 x 360 resolution, 278ppi 1.0GHz dual-core Samsung Exynos 7270 768MB of RAM 4GB of on-board storage 380mAh battery Tizen 49 x 46 x 12.9mm, 63g IP68 dust and water resistance rating Read more Samsung Gear S3 review Samsung Gear S3 officially announced: specs, price, release date and more Samsung Gear S3 hands-on and first impressions Samsung Gear S3 vs Gear S2 comparison Buy the Gear S3 Classic from Amazon Buy the Gear S3 Frontier from Amazon Motorola Moto 360 (2nd Generation) \nSee more Moto 360 (2nd Gen.) photos \nThe original Moto 360 was one of the best Android Wear watches around for quite some time, and now its successor is also at the top of the list.\nThe Motorola Moto 360 (2nd Gen.) has a bigger battery than its predecessor, a Snapdragon 400 processor and comes in two different sizes to fit more users’ wrists. You’ll even be able to customize it with Moto Maker. Overall, the biggest advantages the new Moto 360 brings to the table are the refreshed processing package, a customizable design and the addition of lugs that will make it much easier to swap out watch bands.\nWe should also note that if you’re more of a fitness-oriented person, the Moto 360 Sport is also a great option. It’s cheaper than the standard Moto 360, and comes with a large array of fitness tracking features.\nSpecs 42mm variant: \n1.37-inch IPS LCD display with 360 x 325 resolution, 233ppi 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor 512MB of RAM 4GB of on-board storage 300mAh battery Android Wear 42.0 x 42.0 x 11.4mm IP67 dust and water resistance rating 46mm variant: \n1.56-inch IPS LCD display with 360 x 330 resolution, 263ppi 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor 512MB of RAM 4GB of on-board storage 400mAh battery 46.0 x 46.0 x 11.4mm IP67 dust and water resistance rating Read more Motorola Moto 360 (2nd Gen.) review Motorola Moto 360 (2nd Gen.) unboxing and initial setup Buy now from Amazon Apple Watch Series 2 \nI know, I know. This is an Apple product. And we only like Android products here, right?\nWrong-o.\nThe Apple Watch Series 2 is a really nice smartwatch that does exactly what it should. It’ll give you quick access to notifications, allow you to pay with your wrist, give you turn-by-turn directions, and it’s a decent fitness tracker. And in terms of design, it doesn’t feel like Apple cut too many corners with the overall look and feel of the device. Even the Sport model (the cheapest one of the bunch) feels like a well-built piece of hardware.\nThere are a few downsides to the Watch, though. Battery life isn’t stellar, and oftentimes the interface can get really confusing. It’s a solid second attempt at a smartwatch, sure, but Apple still has a lot of work to do.\nThe Apple Watch Series 2 is on the pricier side of the smartwatch landscape at around $369, but you might be lucky enough to find a refurbished model for less than that on Amazon or eBay.\nSpecs 42mm variant (aluminum): \n1.5-inch OLED Retina display with 390 x 312 resolution, 390ppi Apple S2 processor watchOS 42.5 x 36.4 x 11.4mm, 34.2g (case only) 50m water resistance, ISO22810 rating 38mm variant (aluminum): \n1.3-inch OLED Retina display with 340 x 272 resolution, 340ppi Apple S2 processor watchOS 38.6 x 33.3 x 11.4mm, 28.2g (case only) 50m water resistance, ISO22810 rating Read more Apple Watch Series 2 review Apple Watch Series 2 vs the competition Buy now from Apple So there you have it, our list of the best smartwatches on the market!
