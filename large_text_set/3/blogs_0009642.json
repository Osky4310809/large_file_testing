The news set off a rhetorical firestorm that the Chicago Tribune dubbed the \"Skokie swastika war.\"\nThen and now — as the Jewish community sits on edge after a spate of bomb threats and... \n(Ron Grossman) The special German prosecutor's office that investigates Nazi crimes concluded that enough evidence existed to pursue murder charges against Karkoc.\nAP's initial investigation found that Karkoc entered the U.S. in 1949 by failing to disclose to American authorities his role as a commander in the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion. The investigation found that Karkoc was in the area of the massacres, but did not uncover evidence linking him directly to atrocities.\nThe second story, based upon an investigative file originally from the Ukrainian intelligence agency's archive, revealed that a private under Karkoc's command testified in 1968 that Karkoc ordered an assault on the village of Chlaniow in retaliation for the slaying of the SS major who led the Legion, in which Karkoc was a company commander.\nA German roster of the unit confirmed that Pvt. Ivan Sharko, a Ukrainian, served under Karkoc's command at the time.\nOther eyewitness accounts, both from villagers and members of Karkoc's unit, corroborated the testimony that the company set buildings on fire and gunned down more than 40 men, women and children.\nOther soldiers who served under Karkoc backed up Sharko's testimony about civilian killings.\nPvt. Vasyl Malazhenski, for example, told Soviet investigators that in 1944 that unit was directed to \"liquidate all the residents\" of Chlaniow — although he did not say who gave the order.\nSharko also testified in the investigative documents that Karkoc's company was directly involved in a \"punitive mission\" against Poles near the village of Sagryn in 1944.\nAssociated Press \n  Europe Homicide Crime Alzheimer's Disease", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:34:03.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
