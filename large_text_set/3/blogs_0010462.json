First off, if you're out there doing it by yourself, all of a sudden you have a solo instrument that's got to articulate bass, rhythm and melody, so you've got two or three things going on at once and, right there, that's a challenge for me. \n\"Then, adding to that, if you want to try and do fingerpicking, it is so different than an electric guitar.\" \nThe guitarist noted during the rest of the chat: \"I started on electric. I started playing when I was 11 and I didn't start playing acoustic till I was about 17. I got my first acoustic and started dabbling around with it, writing songs and stuff. I would play it a little bit in electric shows and stuff and then I started getting a little more serious about it in my late 20s.\" \nEric Johnson released an all-acoustic album titled \"EJ\" back in October. You can check out the \"Water Under the Bridge\" single below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T06:41:53.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
