Locals may recognize her from her days at O Ya and the Guchi’s Midnight Ramen pop-up, but she has also worked at Martín Berasategui’s three-star Michelin restaurant in San Sebastian, located in Spain’s Basque Country, and beyond. Plus, she studied pâtisserie at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris.

The beverage list, by Pagu consultant Tom Schlesinger-Guidelli (previously Island Creek Oyster Bar’s longtime general manager), features wines from the Iberian Peninsula and Basque Country, Japanese sake, Spanish ciders and sherry, and more. Pagu’s beer and cocktail selection comes courtesy of head bartender Caitlin Sullivan, who is serving up sake cocktails, large-format cocktails, a variety of gin and tonics, and lots more.

The large space features a variety of seating options, some of which change from a breakfast-and-lunch cafe-style configuration to a nighttime pintxos bar. There’s also a mezzanine section that overlooks the restaurant, a couple of main dining areas, and a counter surrounding the open kitchen. A four-course tasting menu is served at the “kitchen view” seats . Bonus: The kitchen features an ultra-snazzy Hestan suite ; grab a reservation in one of those seats and gaze in awe.
