I just thought it was the right thing to do.\" \nVictories for Muhammad Ali, Calum French, Pat McCormack, Radoslav Pantaleev and Frazer Clarke earned British Lionhearts a 5-0 victory over the Italian side. \n\"What happened was a shock, but you have to get on with things,\" 19-year-old flyweight Ali said after his bout. \nWelterweight McCormack, 21, added: \"My head was a bit all over and I couldn't really stop thinking about it, but I'm just glad I've come, got the job done and the win. \n\"We had a meeting, a talk. The coaches handled it very well, got us through it. \n\"Tony was standing right next to us, and as everyone was running away he was running to aid. He saw a lot more than us and was a bit shook up. I respect him very much as a man for doing that.\" \nSuper-heavyweight Clarke, 25, said everyone's thoughts were with the victims. \nHe added: \"If we can't get in there and fight after what we saw, how does everyone who was there get on with their lives? \n\"Police officers lost colleagues, families, friends. We were the lucky ones so we had every reason to get in there and put a show on.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T03:52:51.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
