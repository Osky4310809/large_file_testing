When we were comparing notes 0n Goa which, of course, is every Mumbaikar's favourite holiday spot, I was told that my vacation was a mere holiday and not an experience. Wow, thanks! \nThe thing is, that I love my slightly luxurious travels. While booking a hotel, and yes it is always a hotel and never a hut, I always check out the loo first. I need my own space and I cannot share the pot with a stranger. That automatically put hostels out of my list. But the point is, just because I prefer to pay for my own personal loo and a bed sheet without holes, how does that make my travel experience any lesser than yours? \nI believe in experiencing the local flavour as much as the next backpacking travelling hobo around the curb. But trekking it out and budgeting every penny you spend is not the only way to do it. When I plan a holiday, it is like a gift to me from me, an experience to relax after all that hard work I put into my daily life. And I prefer to go a tad luxurious, spend a little extra, and live life slightly queen sized. And I totally understand that your way is right too. Both of us get exactly what we went. You can get your high from the rough end of your travelling stick, and I can get mine from room service. I genuinely feel that nothing makes you more or less of a traveller, or your travelling experiences any less exuberant, either way! \nAt the end of the day, for me, it is about the experiences you have, and not the hotel you stay in or the kind of bike you hire or the food that you eat. You can enjoy the local vibes as well as you can, a shaky tent or a posh hotel notwithstanding, and that's the beauty of travelling. \nAlso, if I choose to stay in bed all day long, and you prefer to visit every visitor's attraction there is, we both are still getting what we want. I came for an experience that lets me relax, sleep in, and watch the sunset from a new place. Whereas you get your kicks out of exploring the city. The point is, we both get what we want. So if I want to spend a couple of thousands extra on a hotel, please let me. I don't need your criticism, and I won't give you mine, because we are both looking for the same thing at the end of the day - a break from the usual.
