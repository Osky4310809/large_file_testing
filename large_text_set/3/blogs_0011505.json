Amtrak also canceled and modified service up and down the Northeast Corridor. In New York City, the above-ground portions of the subway system were being shut down Tuesday morning.\nIn Massachusetts, where forecasts called for 12 to 18 inches of snow, Gov. Charlie Baker encouraged motorists to stay off the roads and to take public transit only if absolutely necessary. The fast snowfall rates will “create hazardous driving conditions across the Commonwealth,” he said.\nSchools in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston and elsewhere were all closed Tuesday.\nBank teller Jana White said her plans for riding out the storm included “lots of hot chocolate and a couple of sappy movies.” The 23-year-old Trenton, New Jersey, resident said she expected to get Tuesday off work.\n“It’s a reminder that winter is always ready to take shot at you, so you have to stay prepared,” she said. “We’ve got food and snacks and drinks, so as long as the power stays on we should be in good shape.”\nIn Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and urged residents not to be lulled into a false sense of security due to the mild winter.\n“This is a serious winter storm,” Hogan said, adding that some parts of the state could see 12 to 18 inches of snow. “It’s obviously going to be the biggest event we’ve had this season and people need to be prepared. They need to be safe.”\nThe heaviest snowfall was expected Tuesday morning through the afternoon, with snowfall rates as high as 2 to 4 inches per hour.\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that approximately 700 National Guard members would be deployed, along with more than 2,000 snow plows to keep up with the storm that was expected to bring a foot or more of snow to some parts of the state.\nThe nor’easter comes a week after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s. Spring officially starts on March 20.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Bruce Shipkowski contributed to this report from Trenton, New Jersey.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T09:40:56.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
