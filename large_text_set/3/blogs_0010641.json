In a clever wrinkle, the Monster of the Week was dementia, which tragically affects so many people as they age. But in the case of Wesen, dementia has an added, dangerous element. \nAs Rosalee ( Bree Turner) and Monroe ( Silas Weir Mitchell) tell Nick ( David Giuntoli) and Hank ( Russell Hornsby) , when Wesen suffer from dementia, they can woge without knowing it, which puts them at risk of becoming known to the general public, who can see the transformations that Wesen ordinarily hide. \nSo there were two Wesen who took the lives of others in \"Blood Magic.\" One was an old man whose confusion led him to woge and attack two innocent Portlanders. \nThe other was a doctor who was also a Wesen who, in his woged, giant bug-like form, was the Wesen \"Godfather of Death.\" -- Grimm (@NBCGrimm) March 11, 2017 \nAs Rosalee and Monroe told Nick, this Godfather of Death is summoned to kill Wesen whose dementia has caused them to woge without knowing it. It's a ritual among Wesen, they say, for loved ones or caretakers to call on the Godfather when the time has come to end the life of a Wesen whose dementia is putting others at risk. \nMonroe and Rosalee have made an agreement that each will contact the Godfather of Death if the other becomes ill with dementia. \nThis was sad and touching, and a nice insight into the Wesen world, and how those in the community have their own rituals, far removed from humans. \nIt was also a good touch that Nick and Hank were mainly interested in clearing a nursing home orderly accused of killing an elderly lady whose own dementia led her to attack the orderly and who the doctor, who was on staff at the nursing home (how appropriate), had killed in his Godfather of Death duties. \nOther notable moments from the episode: \nEve's research: Eve ( Elizabeth Tulloch ) is staying at Monroe and Rosalee's, though she spends all her time at the spice shop, poring over spooky books of Hexenbiest spells that belonged to Adalind's ( Claire Coffee ) mother. After a concerned visit from Nick, Eve says that she wants to go inside the mirror portal, instead of waiting for that skull monster inside to attack again. Nick insists she shouldn't do this alone, and Eve agrees. And then, naturally, at the end of the episode, Eve smears some of her blood on a mirror at Monroe and Rosalee's and, alone, enters the mirror portal. What happened to not doing this alone? And no wonder Monroe was nervous about Eve bringing this weird mirror portal stuff into their house. You know, that doesn't really look like a good idea... #Grimm pic.twitter.com/ZNRhcjjpM1 -- Grimm (@NBCGrimm) March 11, 2017 \nRenard's worried about Diana's drawings: After hearing from his Siberian friend that the symbols Diana has been drawing could be a sign of something very dangerous, Renard (Sasha Roiz) tries to pressure Adalind into letting him see those tunnels where Diana saw the symbols for himself. She refers Renard to Nick, who isn't crazy about that idea, obviously. Is Renard really just worried about Diana, or does he have ulterior motives? \nFinally! A customer at the spice shop!: Unfortunately, Mrs. Stanton is buying melatonin to try and get her husband to sleep. And as we see at the end of the episode, Mr. Stanton is the Wesen whose dementia has led him to kill two Portlanders. \nPortland mentions: On the plus side, Northwest Portland's Cafe Nell gets a shoutout from Sgt. Wu (Reggie Lee) for its \"amazing linguini and clams.\" On the minus side, one of the innocent victims is murdered by Mr. Stanton as she exits the restaurant and heads to her car. \nAlso, we saw the distinctive sight of Portland's Amtrak Union Station in the background as Nick and Hank showed up at the orderly's place. \nLines of the Week: \n\"If it messes with my family, I will rip its green, ugly eyeballs out\" -- Rosalee, stating on the record that she's ready to take care of that \"skull monster\" in the mirror; \n\"I think Eve's looking for a little redemption. Aren't we all?\" -- Adalind to Nick on why Eve is intent on crossing the mirror portal to find and kill what's on the other side to remove the threat from the others; \n\"Make sure your brother doesn't fall off the bed. Oh, and no making him float, either\" -- Adalind, dispensing motherly guidance to an offscreen Diana; \n\"I suppose if any place is going to have a giant assassin bug, it'd be Portland\" -- the medical examiner (Dana Millican) to Nick and Hank about toxins found in a victim's body. \n-- Kristi Turnquist", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:55:21.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
