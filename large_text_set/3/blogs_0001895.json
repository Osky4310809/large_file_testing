With Brexit emerging as the likely trigger for SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon to demand a second independence referendum, Mrs May admitted leaving the EU could bring “unintended consequences”. \nBut she insisted there was a “positive, optimistic and passionate case” to stay together. \nMrs May said it would also give Scots a chance to increase trade with emerging markets — including a push of Scottish whisky in the vast and lucrative Indian market. “After Brexit, its potential for growth in exports across the world is immense,” she said of the £5 billion whisky industry. \n“But within the EU, Scotch whisky faces a tariff of 150 per cent for selling to India. And Scotch whisky, the world’s pre-eminent spirit, has just a one per cent share of the Indian market.” Nicola Sturgeon insists she is not bluffing about second Scottish independence referendum \nBut Mrs May acknowledged that Brexit required a careful overhaul of decision-making in the British Isles to ensure that the Union was not pulled apart. \n“In short, we must avoid any unintended consequences for the coherence and integrity of a devolved United Kingdom as a result of our leaving the EU,” she said. \nIn a speech designed to counter head-on Ms Sturgeon’s moves towards another independence referendum, Mrs May said she would adopt a new “collective responsibility” that meant every decision must be taken with the Union in mind. \nShe struck a positive tone, in contrast with the Project Fear of David Cameron’s campaign, saying: “Together we form the world’s greatest family of nations. It is written in our collective achievements, both at home and in the world.” \nShe criticised Ms Sturgeon for “tunnel vision nationalism” and playing politics “as though it were a game”. “It is in the interest of everyone in our country that we seize those opportunities and make a success of what lies ahead.” \nMrs May said the “pooling and sharing of risks and resources” between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were a benefit to all, from the banks bailout to meeting welfare payments when North Sea oil prices plunged. Sir John Major criticises Theresa May's Brexit strategy \nEarlier, a senior SNP MP, Stephen Gethins, refused on BBC radio to say if the nationalists would try to call a second referendum. He said Mrs May’s decision to leave the European single market was straining relations. \n“If the UK Government rejects a perfectly reasonable compromise ... Then we really need to consider our options,” he said. Scottish Secretary David Mundell hit back: “What we see are synthetic grievances ... Brexit has been just another excuse for talking about independence.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T17:50:52.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
