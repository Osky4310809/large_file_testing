Wilson came on for 25 minutes at Plymouth to be the 19th player blooded in the first team in the 15 months since Klopp arrived Share Harry Wilson is the 19th player to debut for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp (Photo: Liverpool via Getty) Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Wednesday night at Plymouth may not be a glamour fixture for most Liverpool players but it's one Harry Wilson won't forget. \nThe 19-year-old became the 19th player to make his debut under Jurgen Klopp in the Reds' 1-0 win over the League Two outfit. \nWilson's full international debut for Wales came in October 2013, but he had to wait until this week for his first-team Liverpool bow. \nAnd he did it in style, replacing Brazilian star Philippe Coutinho for the last 25 minutes at Home Park. \nSo that's 19 debuts in 15 months for Klopp, 12 of them young players who were at the club when the German arrived. \nHere's who the Reds boss has blooded so far and five of the brightest sparks at the club who could be next.

Rhian Brewster Rhian Brewster is among Liverpool's vibrant striker stocks (Photo: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC) \nThe 17-year-old striker was, alongside 'keeper Kamil Grabara, Liverpool U18's brightest player in their 3-1 FA Youth Cup defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday. Despite being starved of service for much of the game, he ran hard with and without the ball and scored a brilliant goal. He was the quickest to react to Okera Simmonds' low cross, firing past Aro Muric to haul Liverpool level shortly after the half-hour mark. The striker joined the Reds at the age of 15 and he has already represented England U17s.

Already on the first-team radar, he was an unused member of the FA Cup bench at Exeter City, where a host of Klopp's young guns first appeared at St James Park. Paulo Alves Paulo Alves was on the bench at Plymouth but wasn't used (Photo: Liverpool via Getty) \nIt seems like a matter of time for this teenager, who was an unused substitute for the Red's 1-0 win at Plymouth on Wednesday night. He hails from Cristiano Ronaldo's childhood stomping ground, Madeira in Portugal, and arrived at Anfield from Porto during the summer of 2015. Alves, sometimes referred to as Paulinio, turned 19 on Christmas Day and has already had a taste of senior football with Sanjoanense in the Portuguese third tier. Bobby Adekanye Bobby Adekanye came to Liverpool from Barcelona via Ajax (Photo: Liverpool via Getty) \nThe Nigerian-born Dutch youth international came to Anfield with some serious pedigree - cutting his teeth at Ajax and then Barcelona before a year on loan at PSV Einhoven ahead of the move to Liverpool. A sharp left winger, Adekanye told the Liverpool Echo last year that he models his game on Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben. “Arjen Robben,” he said. “I’ve always liked his style and I try to play like him. He’s exciting and makes football a joy to watch.\" Brooks Lennon (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty Images) \nA rare American talent in the Premier League ranks, Lennon is being linked to a return to Real Salt Lake, the club from which Liverpool signed him in the MLS. A loan deal would of course delay any start for the Reds, but a call on his future would show how he's regarded at Anfield - it could be permanent with the US club keen to enlist local talent. Danny Ings return from injury has limited his time in the U23s but he's impressed when given the chance. The 19 who've debuted under Klopp \n1. Connor Randall \n7 appearances in total.
