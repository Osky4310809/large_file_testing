We don’t blame you, man. \nFITNESS FEAT #2: As he notes in his Instagram bio, Zach Ruhl is “a good ol’ Texas boy that likes lifting heavy shit.” The man doesn’t have any legs, but those arms? Jacked. \nFITNESS FEAT #3: In an act of pure balance and strength, Russian native Alexander Khokhlov manages to overhead squat about 230 pounds with one arm. His form isn’t perfect, but you know, we’ll let it slide this time. FITNESS FEAT #4: Mikey Witous might be a dwarf, but that didn’t stop him from pursuing his love for CrossFit. In fact, it just makes him the self-proclaimed #FittestDwarfonEarth. Here he is squatting 475 pounds, breaking his personal record by 20 pounds. \nFITNESS FEAT #5: Four people, one flip. Even though this trampoline show group makes the stunt look easy, we strongly advise that you don’t try this at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T05:12:46.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
