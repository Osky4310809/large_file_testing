Here are 12 times the long-running comedy series got it right. Fox \nLady Gaga \nOn the episode \"Lisa Goes Gaga,\" Lady Gaga is shown suspended by cables flying over the audience at a concert. Well surprise, surprise because at the Super Bowl LI's halftime show, Gaga descended from the stadium's roof with suspension cables wearing pretty much the same outfit on her episode. Fox \n2016 Nobel Prize Winner \nIn a 2010 episode, Milhouse predicted that Bengt R. Holmstrom would win the Nobel Prize in Economics and, sure enough, in 2016 Holmstrom and Oliver Hart were announced as joint winners of the prize. Fox \nDonald Trump Presidency \nSeventeen years ago in an episode titled \"Bart to the Future,\" Lisa becomes president after Donald Trump, apparently, ruined the economy. \nFox \nSiegfried and Roy Tiger Attack \nIn 1993, an episode titled \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling),\" magicians in a Siegfried and Roy-like show got attacked by their trustworthy tiger. \nIn 2003, Roy was attacked by one of their white tigers during a live performance. He sustained injuries, but lived. \nFox \nArnold Palmer \nOn the 28th season premiere, the satirical series made an Arnold Palmer joke... on the day that golfer Arnold Palmer died. \nHomer Simpson tells his wife Marge that he plans to “Arnold Palmer” his pal Lenny. \n“Arnold Palmer Lenny?” Marge responds. “You’re going to Arnold Palmer Lenny?” \nHe was of course referring to the lemonade and iced tea drink mixture -- which was named after the golfer. Fox \nFaulty Voting Machine \nDuring the 2012 elections, a voting machine proved faulty when votes cast for Barack Obama went to Mitt Romney instead. \nIn a 2008 episode, Homer Simpson went to the voting booths to cast a vote for Obama, but... his vote went to McCain instead. Fox \nHiggs Boson \nIn a 1998 episode, \"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace,\" Homer writes out an equation on a chalkboard which, if solved, “you get the mass of a Higgs boson that’s only a bit larger than the nano-mass of a Higgs boson actually is,\" says Simon Singh , science author. Fox \nHorse Meat Scandal \nIn 1994, an episode titled \"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baada Song,\" the lunch lady was seen reaching into a barrel labeled \"assorted horse parts\" and putting the meat into the school's lunch pot. \nIn 2013, it was reported that traces of horse DNA was found in beef products across the UK. \nFox \nGuitar Hero \nThe now basically extinct but once popular video game Guitar Hero was first released in 2005. \nBut in a 2002 \"The Simpsons\" episode, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards give Homer a jacket that has \"guitar hero\" printed on the back of it. Fox \nFarmville \nThe virtual reality game, Farmville, was all the craze in 2009 with people rushing home from work or school to tend to their farm. \nIn a 1998 episode, \"The Simpsons\" shows a scene were kids are excited to play in a yard work simulator. Fox \nOld Beatles Letters \nIn Season 2's episode 18, \"Brush With Greatness,\" Ringo Starr from the Beatles is shown responding to fan letters while saying: \"They took the time to write me, and I don’t care if it takes me another 20 years. I’m going to answer every one of them.\" \nWell, two women in England received a reply to their fan mail form Sir Paul McCartney 50 years later. Fox \nSmart Watches \nSorry Apple, but \"The Simpsons\" had smart watches first. \nIn a 1995 episode in which the show is set in the future, Lisa's husband is shown speaking to a phone on his wrist. \nThe first smartwatch wasn't created until 2013. \nFrom Donald Trump’s presidency to Nobel Prize winners 1 of 14 \n\"The Simpsons\" has an eerie knack for predicting the future, from Donald Trump's presidency to Nobel Prize winners.
