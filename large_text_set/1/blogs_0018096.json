I remember the beautiful mountains surrounding our city in Iraqi Kurdistan and being a happy little girl playing on our street with my brothers and sister. We’d all go on the roof terrace to sleep at night because it was so hot and we’d count the stars and my father would bring us all watermelon. But that wasn’t to last. \nWe are Kurdish and I knew what it was like to feel like a second-class citizen, even then. Because I wasn’t an Arab, I already felt ‘less’. If Saddam Hussein came to town, we had to hang posters of him to pretend we liked him. But he gassed the village my grandparents are from when I was two years old, killing 5,000 people. His aim was to eradicate the Kurds from existence. \nIn 1991, when I was five, we had to flee our home because his troops were coming. My father had a truck, and for two months he’d been collecting food and getting ready to go. One night it was very late and my mum shouted ‘Dashni, we have to go now!’ The Kurdish military fighters, the Peshmergas, were in town and there was so much chaos, everyone desperate to get out, people were trying to get in our truck and we couldn’t move. \nWe were supposed to pick up my grandparents and my mum had to make the awful decision to leave them behind, or we’d be too late to escape – imagine having to make the choice between your children’s safety or your parents. They were just waiting on a cold street alone at night. Thankfully, they survived.

We knew we were safe from Saddam’s troops there, as the terrain was too rough for them. There were children screaming and crying. We lived on that mountain in a tent for two months. Thousands of people were there, dying from the hunger and cold. I made a lot of friends, but they became fewer every day. I have memories of two men burying a dead child wrapped in a white robe a few feet from our tent. And I saw a man fall to his death from the top of the mountain when he was desperately trying to collect fruit from the trees. \nIf it wasn’t for people caring, I wouldn’t be here today. There was a benefit concert in London for us, and from the money raised we were sent aid. I remember running after the helicopters to catch the food they were dropping. Getting out \nThe UN promised there would be a no-fly zone over our area, so we moved back home. The situation became worse and we had to find a way to escape for good. I became very quiet and shut down, and feared helicopters and radio announcements for a very long time. I remember one saying we needed gas masks and if one isn’t available you can use a baby’s nappy, and my mum testing the nappies on us. I got to know darkness and evil. There’s no bigger loss than to take the childhood away from a child. \nI look at the current refugee crisis and it reminds me of my dad. He sold everything we had and set off to find us a better life. It was a difficult time for us, as he wasn’t there to support us any more. My mum couldn’t work, because women weren’t allowed to, so we’d get food from my uncle, but it was very limited. Dad walked all the way to Germany where he’d heard we could seek refuge. \nHe was beaten for being Kurdish, chased by dogs set on him by farmers, and watched his friends die. He tried to swim to Greece, but was caught seven times and sent back to Turkey. On the eighth time he was successful. He then walked to Italy where finally he was given help from a church who would give him food. \nEventually he got on a truck that took him to a camp in Germany – he’d gone from being a respected businessman, living in a nice home, to life in a refugee camp. It was more than two years before we heard from him, when someone we knew travelled back to Iraq and sent a photo of Dad and a box of colouring pencils. I cried so much when I saw that picture.

We went to Istanbul by bus where we we were met by a lady from the United Nations. She put us on a plane, which felt so strange, because it wasn’t gassing or bombing us. \nI remember going to the toilet and discovering soft toilet paper for the first time. I took a lot of it, then collected more when I arrived in Amsterdam, before realising it was available everywhere! My first thought about Holland was it was so flat and there were all these people from the movies with dogs and blonde hair. We went to my father’s friend’s house and there was chocolate spread and pastries and we watched TV and devoured every scrap of it. \nI’d gone to school in Iraq and had a scary teacher who would give me 50 lashes. School in Holland was very different. My teacher taught me to speak Dutch, to read and write and feel free, that it’s OK as a girl to play with boys. But it was tough too. We lived in a small city where there were very few foreigners. Other children didn’t want to play with us, and they would throw dirty water into our garden while I was playing. And so feeling like a second-class citizen continued. Becoming a success \nIt took a long time to grow in confidence, but I believed in something better. In my world, I counted as well. My dream was to be a presenter on Dutch TV, but my parents refused. However, I persuaded them I could work for a local Kurdish TV station and found a job hosting a show called Without Borders, the first Western TV show for Kurds. \nI was making jokes, talking about fashion and talking to men I didn’t know. A man called saying, ‘Who do you think you are to do this? Shame on you.’ And I thought, ‘I’ll show you who I am.’ The show became a hit in Iraqi Kurdistan. I had no idea until I moved back there in 2007 to work for the TV station. I went to a park and security had to take me out. I was like, ‘Oh, I’m famous, OK.’ Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T09:19:02.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
