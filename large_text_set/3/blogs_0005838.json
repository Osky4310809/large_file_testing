Here’s the video. \n“We have to make sure that we can not just count the ballots but verify every name and signature,” Brazile said. “And I want to make sure that at the conclusion of all of our votes, that you, the members of this party, will be able to review those ballots.”   \nIn a general election, Democrats rail against requiring proof of identification before voting, howling that it oppresses the black and the poor. But when their own party has an internal vote, they’re worried about voter fraud. You just can’t make this stuff up. \nThis is the party that chants “Racism!” at the mention of voter ID . This is the party that wants legal identifications for illegal immigrants, according to International Business Times , but not for voters. \nNew DNC Chairman Tom Perez, who was U.S. secretary of labor during former President Barack Obama’s second term, was elected on the second ballot. Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Perez led the fight against voter ID laws in Texas and South Carolina, arguing that such laws discriminate against minorities, according to The Washington Post . \nSo it’s safe to say that while the Democrats’ hypocrisy is clear, we can look forward to another shellacking of the truth on this issue.
