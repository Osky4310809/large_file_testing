AP Photo/Steve Helber\nOn Sunday night in front of the millions of viewers watching the 2017 Grammy Awards, actress Lavern Cox stood on stage and gave a shout out to a Virginia high school student.\n\"Everyone, please Google 'Gavin Grimm,'\" Cox said. \"He's going to the Supreme Court in March. #StandWithGavin.\"\nCox, who is transgender and is an advocate for LGBT rights, elevated awareness for the case which was likely unknown to many viewers.\nGrimm is a transgender student who sued his high school in federal court for refusing to allow him to use the boys' bathroom, which corresponds to his gender identity.\nIn 2016, The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in Grimm's favor.\nThe court pointed to guidance from The Department of Education and Justice Department directing schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity.\nThe Gloucester County School Board appealed the decision and the case is now set to be heard by the Supreme Court in March.\nSEE ALSO: Betsy DeVos was just confirmed as education secretary — here's what she will control NOW WATCH: I'm a 34-year-old who has never had a credit card — and it's the worst financial decision I've made in my life Loading video...
