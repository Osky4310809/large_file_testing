But this year the freedom of the press has been threatened by a Trump presidency and as such, the dinner should not be held. To hold this celebration in a time when the President is actively trying to discredit the press and silence them would be acting complicity to his horrifying reign. Typically the President attends this dinner and while prizes are awarded for excellent journalism, everyone rejoices in the role of the press in a free republic. This year, we are not living in a free republic and calling that out by disrupting our norms is crucial. Please sign the petition to ask that the White house Correspondent's Dinner be canceled this year as an act of resistance against Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:06:27.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
