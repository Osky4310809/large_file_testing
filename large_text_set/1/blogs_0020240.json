It’s not as particularly stretchy as we’ve found on other shoes, but it’s a super comfortable, one-piece knit with nothing that will irritate the foot. It also gives a pretty good hold on the foot. \nOne of the really novel things about this shoe is the midsole. It has what Altra is calling Altra EGO. It’s their own foam that’s a little bouncier than a regular EVA and gives you a lot of rebound, similar to Boost from Adidas. You can feel the bounce when you stand in the shoe, and it has a little bit of a spring feeling to it. \nFor Altra wearers, this shoe fits the same as the Torin , but it has the same stack height that you would get out of the Instinct or Intuition . It’s fairly close to the ground, but there’s enough cushioning and plenty of rubber underneath the foot for traction when you’re going through your stride. \nThe Altra Escalante retails for $120 and will be available in February. It is on the feet of our wear testers right now, and we’ll have more on the shoe in the coming months on RunnersWorld.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:11:55.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
