Backed by a sweet acoustic guitar, the Charlie Heat-produced track finds the singer vowing to love who she wants, no matter what “they” think with lyrics like “One way or another/ I’mma love you/ Slidin’ under covers, undercover/ They don’t wanna see us happy but we say f— it.” \n“Undercover” is off Kehlani’s upcoming album SweetSexySavage , due Jan. 27. Her debut will include previously released tracks “CRZY,”“Advice” and “Distraction.” The songstress is also heading out on a world tour in February. \nListen to “Undercover” and check out the tour dates below.
