Officials told his mom, Cristy Matteo, that if she did not comply the city would “seize him and dispose of him the way they want.” This was completely unacceptable for the Matteo family. \nCristy’s father, Thomas Matteo was recently diagnosed with cancer and he has relied on Wilber’s companionship and support throughout his battle with the disease. Wilber has been officially registered as an Emotional Support Animals with the National Service Animal Registry and Thomas’ oncologist even wrote a letter stating, “Wilbur had provided so much happiness for him, that he was able to take less anxiety medication for the radiation.” Despite these facts, owning a pig as a pet is illegal under New York City Law and so the Department of Health has told the family that Wilber must go. Cristy has made this plea to city officials , “I would just ask him for some compassion for me and my father and to allow [Wilber] to stay. To stay where he belongs — in my home.” Luckily, the outpouring of support has helped Cristy win a reprieve on surrendering Wilbur, but it’s only a few months extra. \n\n\nShe has teamed up with Tony Avella who is proposing that a law that would allow ownership of pigs under 200 pounds within the city limits. The Matteo’s neighbors and friends have also come together and voiced their disapproval of the cities hard line on Wilber. Whatever the outcome of the law, Cristy says “I am going to continue to fight this.” Unfortunately, changing the law can be a slow process, so Cristy made arrangements to rehome Wilbur to Ross Mill Farm just in case. \nWe love to hear about people who love pigs as much as we do and we will do everything we can to help keep Wilber in their home. Pigs are just as smart and emotional as dogs, but it is important to note that they do have many more specialized needs. We’ve seen a huge rise in the teacup pig pet trend , which sadly has led to many pigs being abandoned after their caretakers realize there is indeed no such thing as a “micro pig.” That being said, only truly responsible and aptly prepared guardians should consider bringing a pig into their homes. Based on their dedication to protecting Wilbur, the Matteos seem to be just that. \nYou can help as well by following the Save Wilber Facebook page and adding your voice to the many others fighting for Wilber and the Matteo family. You can also donate to their GoFundMe page, here . If you are in New York, write to your local representative . Together, we can be sure that Wilber gets to stay in his home and help Thomas in his battle against cancer! \nImage source: Save Wilber /Facebook Want to read more posts like this?
