California police find 2 calves crammed inside car The Associated Press BEAUMONT, Calif. \nIt was one of the more unusual calls the California Highway Patrol has received: Someone reported seeing a cow trying to climb out of a small car parked alongside an interstate. \nOfficers responding Saturday along a mountain pass in Southern California's Riverside County discovered a calf trying to escape from a Honda Civic's open trunk. \nAnother calf was crammed into the floor of the backseat. Both calves' hooves were tied. \nInvestigators say the driver was nowhere to be found. The car is registered to an address in Tulare County, more than 250 miles away. \nAuthorities said Monday that the vehicle had not been reported stolen. It's been impounded as evidence. \nThe calves will be cared for at a ranch while officials try to determine who owns them.
