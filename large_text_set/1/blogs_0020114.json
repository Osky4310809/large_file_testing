Even Rihanna took to the streets of NYC to chant with crowds and show off a few trendy dance moves. \nOf course, not every celebrity was able to join in the peaceful demonstration, but they’re still showing their support in other ways. \nTake Kendall Jenner for instance. \nThe 21-year-old supermodel recently took to Instagram to express how “proud” she is of the protesters making their voices heard despite the fact that she wasn’t able to join them. REX/Shutterstock \nKendall posted a photo of a protester’s sign, which quoted Hillary Clinton. The sign reads, \nTo all the little girls watching right now: Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance in the world. \nThe Instagram post, which racked up over 1.3 million likes in under 24 hours, was captioned, \nI wish I could have been a part of this amazing history. Beyond proud. \nLikewise, Kendall! Here is Kendall Jenner’s Instagram post showing her support for the Women’s March protesters. \nKendall Jenner wasn’t the only Kardashian-Jenner sister to share her thoughts on the powerful movement. Kim Kardashian posted the same photo with a different caption. \nThe caption read, \nSo proud of the women and men who stood up for what is right and are determined to make this world a better place for our children. Here’s to strong women. May we know them. May we be them. May we raise them. \nSay what you want about Kim K., but I think we can all agree with that! Here is Kim Kardashian’s post regarding the massive Women’s March demonstrations this weekend. \nThis just goes to show there are plenty of other ways to express yourself and show your support for the many important causes we as Americans must tend to — even if you can’t physically be there in the flesh.
