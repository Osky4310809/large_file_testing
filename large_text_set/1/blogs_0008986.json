He was his own attorney during sentencing and insisted that he wasn't mentally ill, but he never asked for forgiveness or mercy, or explained the crime.\nAnd he threw away one last chance to plead for his life on Tuesday, telling jurors: \"I still feel like I had to do it.\"\nEvery juror looked directly at Roof, 22, as he spoke for about five minutes. A few nodded as he reminded them that they said during jury selection they could fairly weigh the factors of his case. Only one of them, he noted, had to disagree to spare his life.\n\"I have the right to ask you to give me a life sentence, but I'm not sure what good it would do anyway,\" he said.\nWhen the verdict was read, he stood stoic and showed no emotion. Several family members of victims wiped away quiet tears.\nDylann Roof's two death penalty trials The 22-year-old man charged with killing nine black worshipers at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. faces two death penalty trials, a first in U.S. history.\nThe 22-year-old man charged with killing nine black worshipers at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. faces two death penalty trials, a first in U.S. history.\nSee more videos Roof told FBI agents when they arrested him after the June 17, 2015, slayings that he wanted the shootings to bring back segregation or perhaps start a race war. Instead, the slayings had a unifying effect, as South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from its Statehouse for the first time in more than 50 years and other states followed suit, taking down Confederate banners and monuments. Roof had posed with the flag in photos.\nMalcolm Graham, whose sister Cynthia Hurd was slain, said he thought the jury made the right decision.\n\"There is no room in America's smallest jail cell for hatred, racism and discrimination,\" he said from his home in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"The journey for me and my family today has come to an end.\"\nCharleston church shooting: Dylann Roof puts up no defense against death penalty Tribune news services After four days of testimony, prosecutors rested their death penalty case Monday against convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof , calling more than two dozen people during the trial's penalty phase.\nMost of the testimony consisted of heartwarming stories about each of the nine people Roof...\nAfter four days of testimony, prosecutors rested their death penalty case Monday against convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof , calling more than two dozen people during the trial's penalty phase.\nMost of the testimony consisted of heartwarming stories about each of the nine people Roof...\n(Tribune news services) Roof specifically picked out Emanuel AME Church, the South's oldest black church, to carry out the cold, calculated slaughter, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson said.\nThe 12 people he targeted opened the door for a stranger with a smile, he said. Three people survived the attack.\n\"They welcomed a 13th person that night ... with a kind word, a Bible, a handout and a chair,\" Richardson said during his closing argument. \"He had come with a hateful heart and a Glock .45.\"\nThe gunman sat with the Bible study group for about 45 minutes. During the final prayer — when everyone's eyes were closed — he started firing. He stood over some of the fallen victims, shooting them again as they lay on the floor, Richardson said.\nThe prosecutor reminded jurors about each one of the victims and the bloody scene that Roof left in the church's lower level.\nNearly two dozen friends and relatives of the victims testified during the sentencing phase of the trial. They shared cherished memories and talked about a future without a mother, father, sister or brother. They shed tears, and their voices shook, but none of them said whether Roof should face the death penalty.\nJennifer Pinckney testified about huddling under a desk with her 6-year-old daughter, her hand clasped over the girl's mouth to keep her quiet, as Roof started firing.\nNot knowing for certain if the danger had passed, Pinckney dialed 911 and breathlessly told an operator she had heard shots inside the church.\n\"I think there's been a shooting. I'm in the closet, under a desk,\" Pinckney told the operator. \"Please hurry.\"\nOn the call, Pinckney tries to comfort her daughter Malana, who had been watching cartoons in her father's office as he participated in Bible study.\n\"Daddy's dead?\" Malana says.\n\"No, baby, no,\" the mother says. But at that moment, Pinckney said she knew her husband, church pastor Clementa Pinckney, had been killed.\nThe prosecutor reminded jurors that Clementa Pinckney, the church pastor and a state senator, would be remembered for singing goofy songs and watching cartoons with his young daughters. In a sign of perhaps how important that testimony was, jurors re-watched a speech by Pinckney in which he talks about the history of Emanuel and its mission.\nThe jury convicted him last month of all 33 federal charges he faced, including hate crimes.\nRoof did not explain his actions to jurors, saying only that \"anyone who hates anything in their mind has a good reason for it.\"\nRoof had the opportunity to present evidence that he had possibly suffered from mental illness, but he did not call any witnesses or present any evidence.\nIn one of his journals, he wrote that he didn't believe in psychology, calling it \"a Jewish invention\" that \"does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don't.\"\nHis attorneys said he didn't want to present any evidence that might embarrass him or his family.\nAfter he was sentenced, Roof asked a judge to appoint him new attorneys, but the judge said he was not inclined to because they had performed \"admirably.\"\n\"We are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy,\" the attorneys said in a veiled reference to the mental health issues they wanted to present.\nA judge will formally sentence him during a hearing Wednesday.\nThe last person sent to federal death row was Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2015.\nAssociated Press \n  Crime Homicide Hate Crimes Clementa Pinckney Charleston Church Shooting Boston Marathon", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T01:25:49.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
