And for good reason. When Streep was given the Cecil B. DeMille award for “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment” during the 2017 Golden Globes, she used the platform to speak about how free press and our diverse nation need to be preserved.\nStreep has been receiving criticism — including from Donald Trump — for her statements about the president-elect. However, there are plenty of other people in the world who are in awe of Streep’s Golden Globes speech . She is the greatest living actress alive , so it’s no wonder that she delivered her message so eloquently that she moved audience members to tears. And even people who weren’t at the Golden Globes have taken to Twitter to praise Streep.\nHere are just some of the tweets that show how much the internet is adoring Dame Streep (as Viola Davis called her) right now for her quote-worthy speech.\nThere were celebs who were’t part of the Globes tweeting about it. There has never been anyone like Meryl Streep. I love her. #GoldenGlobes \n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 9, 2017 Meryl Streep. It's this same level of bravery that she has offered us, freely, again and again. #GoldenGlobes #MerylStreep \n— Uzo Aduba (@UzoAduba) January 9, 2017 \"When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose\" thank you #MerylStreep #GoldenGlobes \n— Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) January 9, 2017 Congratulations to the insanely #talented #MerylStreep on her award & truly poignant speech last night #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/4heOVGKgdz \n— Cary Elwes (@Cary_Elwes) January 9, 2017 \"Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence\". Well said, #MerylStreep , well said. #GoldenGlobes \n— Valerie Bertinelli (@Wolfiesmom) January 9, 2017 And non-actors — whether they are in the public eye or not — showing their admiration. Meryl Streep is the only person who can make a 5 min & 47 second acceptance speech sound short. https://t.co/ffIBUjB01J \n— Ali (@96Alifarooq) January 9, 2017 Meryl Streep beautifully calls outs Donald Trump for mocking disabled reporter during her speech at #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/Uh0cTkAbJI \n— Greg Hogben (@MyDaughtersArmy) January 9, 2017 If you are wondering what class, intelligence and integrity looks like just look at #MerylStreep #classandclassandclass #GoldenGlobes \n— Adam Rousar (@arousar) January 9, 2017 #MerylStreep speech...Thank you for standing and shining a light on what is really important. The bullies will not win #GoldenGlobes \n— Wendy L. Wilson (@WendyLWilson_) January 9, 2017 Meryl Streep defines allyship as she uses her own time to shine to call for respect 4 others & justice 4 all. Why we love her #GoldenGlobes \n— Rodney Glasgow (@glasgow_rodney) January 9, 2017 #MerylStreep with the best speech..ever, like ever. And, it's not even over. I wish she could teach the world how to be #queen #GoldenGlobes \n— Jeff Kelly ™ (@jeffkellyRADIO) January 9, 2017 Be the Meryl Streep you wish to see in the world. #GoldenGlobes \n— Mir.

Bravery, poise, eloquence, and speaking for many rather than just for herself, and for what is right. #GoldenGlobes \n— Tim Teeman (@TimTeeman) January 9, 2017 Then there were the people who were actually at the Globes and got to hear the speech in person. (We’re a bit jealous.) Meryl, you give me life. #GoldenGlobes \n— Gina Rodriguez (@HereIsGina) January 9, 2017 Last night's #GoldenGlobes were inspiring. #MerylStreep you are made of gold. Thank you for your message last night.\n— Zoe Saldana (@zoesaldana) January 9, 2017 Is there anyone better? #Meryl \n— Anna Kendrick (@AnnaKendrick47) January 9, 2017 MERYL STREEP\n— John Legend (@johnlegend) January 9, 2017 And — of course — people were comparing her speech delivery to her ever-cool character Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada . Meryl Streep just explained political corruption and the rise of fascism like it was a cerulean sweater or something.\n— Ryan Houlihan (@RyanHoulihan) January 9, 2017 Watch the speech that inspired all of this below.\nAt tonight's #GoldenGlobes we honor Hollywood legend Meryl Streep with the prestigious Cecil B. Demille Award. pic.twitter.com/dxpeCDNXY6 \n— Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017 As demonstrated by these tweets, Streep was the talk of the town after the Globes and we love her for it.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:27:34.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
