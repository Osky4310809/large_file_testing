The study features styling cues based along the lines of the “Ë” lifestyle product collection presented at last year’s Paris Motor Show. \nAside from new graphic components and bodystyling add-ons, the MPV – based on the nine-seater XS variant of the type – has been given a special interior layout and also gets a 4WD conversion job. \nThe changes are led by a Technical White exterior, with grey camouflage graphics – enhanced with red decals – to be found on the bonnet and sides of the vehicle. Touches of the same red colour adorn the special snow chains found on the wheels, which are 19-inch units finished in dark chrome. Front and rear protective skid plates and roof bars with a satin aluminium finish complete the exterior rework. \nThe 4X4 Ë Concept’s interior, meanwhile, features a warm design scheme, with seats finished in white leather for the upper seat backs/headrests and in mottled grey Alcantara on the lower half of the units. Elsewhere, a subtle blue, white and red colour scheme pays a nod to the “Ë” capsule collection in the form of cloth strips and piping, while an aluminium-coloured strip runs across the entire width of lower part of the dashboard. \nIt’s not all show. The concept – based on a BlueHDi 150 S&S diesel with a six-speed manual gearbox – offers an improved ground clearance over the production model, sitting 60 mm higher. \nIts special disengageable 4×4 transmission, put together by the brand’s partner, Automobiles Dangel, a French all-terrain specialist, is already available on special order in the Citroën network. Though the automaker says it is feasible on the production version of the SpaceTourer, it didn’t reveal if it will be offered as a normal option down the line.
