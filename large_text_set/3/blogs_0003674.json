Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nHarry Kane's brilliant brace ended Everton's nine-match unbeaten run and cut Chelsea’s lead at the top to seven points. \nThe England striker opened the scoring after 20 minutes with a sensational, 30-yard strike. He added a second 11 minutes after the break when Mousa Dembele and Dele Alli robbed Morgan Schneiderlin to set him up. \nThe two goals for Kane, who clinched his century last week, now mean he has scored 14 home league goals this season, the highest number ever recorded by a Spurs player in a single Premier League campaign. \nKane also came out on top in his showdown for fellow Golden Boot contender Romelu Lukaku, who netted with ten minutes left. \nThere was more late drama through, as Dele Alli put th hosts 3-1 up only for Enner Valencia to make it 3-2. \nChelsea go to West Ham tomorrow night while Spurs are next in action a week today, at home to Millwall in their FA Cup quarter-finals. 1. Kane is the real deal Kane netted his 18th and 19th goals of the campaign (Photo: Getty Images) \nThe interview he gave last week, admitting he had no problem with people saying he is up there with the best in the world, gave an insight into his sky-high confidence right now. \nAnother two here and what a return from another productive season for the England striker. It is a nonsense that some critics are still questioning whether he is world class. Three seasons doing the business not enough for you? \nKane, the current Golden Boot winner missed near-enough two months during the first half of the season with injury. Yet he is still back at the top of the Premier League scoring charts this time around . He put Romelu Lukaku in the shade here and has edged ahead of the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Funnily enough, Kane has been suggesting in interviews over the past few weeks that he feels he needs more pace to his game. \nWhat he brings to the table right now is more than enough thank you very much.

Wanyama one of the deals of the season Victor Wanyama put in an excellent shift (Photo: Julian Finney) \nOthers get the headlines but the £9million spent to take the Kenyan midfielder from Southampton last summer remains one of the best bits of business this season. \nIt wasn’t just the Spurs defence that kept Lukaku off the scoresheet. It was the protection that Lukaku provided for them. On opposite sides to Morgan Schneiderlin, the man with whom he formed a formidable partnership at Southampton, Wanyama was again outstanding. Even allowing for that moment, late in the first half, when he gave the ball away and had Mauricio Pochettino jumping up and down on the touchline in frustration. \nWanyama earlier hit the post and showed just why he remains a key component of this Tottenham team. 3. Lukaku can't be silenced Lukaku's late strike game Everton hope (Photo: Getty Images) \nThey kept him quiet for 80 minutes. But the Belgian is just too good to be silenced for 90. Prowling across the Spurs backline and sniffing out the chances, he cashed in as countryman Jan Vertonghen slipped trying to close him down outside the box. Lukaku eased past him and slipped it into the bottom corner to set up a grandstand finish. \nConsidering Harry Kane had three people supporting him and Lukaku was isolated for much of the game, you have to give the former Chelsea striker credit. There was no way he was not getting a share of the headlines here. 4. Barkley worth a punt for Spurs Barkley could be a cheeky bargain (Photo: Action Images via Reuters) \nCould this man he lining up here next season in a Spurs shirt? He still hasn’t yet signed a new deal with Everton and, with 16 months left on his contract, he could yet prove a terrific, cheeky, bargain buy for the north Londoners. Despite the criticism he has received at times from Ronald Koeman, Barkley can clearly pick a pass and combined on a couple of occasions with team-mates here to set up Lukaku. Not 24 until December, Barkley still has his best years to come. If Everton don’t want him, Spurs will gladly take him off their hands. 5. Pochettino remains hands-on \nIt has become noticeable in recent weeks that the Spurs boss has taken the Antonio Conte approach to micro-managing his team from the touchline. \nHe is perhaps not as animated as the Italian. But he is certainly as fiery when his players give away the ball. He was all over his men from the start last week during their 4-0 win over Stoke, three days after they’d blown a hatful of chances against Gent to crash out of the Europa League. He was at it again here, refusing to relax at 1-0 against a potent Everton side. Perhaps, in general terms, he senses a complacency in his Spurs team and wants to sharpen up their killer instinct. \nThey should, for example, have had four during the first half. Instead they had just the one by the break. Pochettino is not a man for living dangerously. Expect his hands-on approach to continue going forward. poll loading Will Everton finish in the top six this season? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T17:29:37.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
