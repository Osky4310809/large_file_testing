In fact the player later explained that it was a locker room joke. \n“I feel like it’s the wrong time because it puts my team in that situation and coaching staff in that situation,” he said. “I have a great relationship with Steve Kerr, and he knows that. Steve spoke to you guys about it, you know what I mean. Steve in his words, someone still may not believe him, but he and I are in a great place. We don’t even have to speak about it because he knew that in no way, shape or form that I’m talking about him.”   \nInterestingly, Iguodola is far from the first Black professional athlete to be punished for words that supposedly were racially offensive. That honor may belong to Black Lives Matter hero Colin Kaepernick, who ironically was penalized in 2014 for calling an opposing Black player the N-word .  4'); });", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T00:01:04.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
