But he is now set to return to New South Wales to strengthen the Jets — who are aiming to end a long-term Finals hoodoo. \nThat news will give Roar coach John Aloisi headaches, with fellow stars DeVere and Maclaren expected to leave the club in the off-season. Have heard Dimi Petratos has signed with the Jets for next season. Great signing — Ray Gatt (@Gatty54) January 24, 2017 \nDeVere’s impressive performances have seen him talked up for a Socceroos recall and linked with moves back to Asia, while Maclaren has been dropped to the bench in recent weeks as speculation of his future continues. \nMaclaren has been linked with a marquee move to Western Sydney Wanderers while interest from Melbourne Victory remains. \nFox Sports’ Mark Bosnich has said he believes Maclaren’s benching centres around his contract situation. \n“I think he’s sitting on the bench because of the contractual situation, that’s just my opinion,” he said on Fox Sports’ Sunday Shootout . \n“But the point really that Brisbane have got to decide is: are they willing to cut off their nose to spite their face? \n“Obviously the contractual situation is that because of that you are sitting him on the bench but you are costing the team. \n“We saw the team coming out in support of Jamie Maclaren this week. \n“They’ve got to make that decision. We don’t know whether that’s the club’s decision or whether it’s John Aloisi’s decision.” media_camera Luke DeVere could be set to leave Brisbane Roar. \nBut there has also been links with a lucrative move to China, with former Perth Glory teammate Michael Thwaite telling Fox Sports : “I’ve heard some rumours that Chinese and Asian [clubs] are looking at a player like him.” \nBrisbane’s moves so far this season to tie down off-contract players has resulted in the re-signing of 34-year-old club captain Matt McKay and 33-year-old Danish import Thomas Kristensen. \nClub legend Thomas Broich’s contract is up at the end of the season, but he had delayed talks to allow Brisbane to focus on tying down their younger stars. \nAhead of the Big Blue, Adam Peacock, Simon Hill and Daniel Garb tackle all the big talking points in the wonderful world of football. \nMELBOURNE CITY ANNOUNCE VALKANIS APPOINTMENT \nMelbourne City have confirmed Michael Valkanis will take charge of the side for the rest of the season. \nHaving taken over on an interim basis after the shock resignation of John van’t Schip, Valkanis will have 11 more regular season games to try and propel City into a strong position heading into the Finals. \n“The next few months represent an important period for the first team,” he said after the announcement. media_camera Michael Valkanis. \n“The players and staff collectively recognise the challenge and opportunity that the second half of the season presents and I am incredibly motivated by the responsibility and the opportunity to guide the team for the remainder of the campaign.” \nSOME GOOD NEWS FOR BRISBANE ROAR \nTommy Oar says there’s no substance to rumours he will leave Brisbane Roar during the January transfer window and expects to see out the remainder of his contract with the A-League club. \nSpeculation has lingered for months that the winger would leave for either China or the Middle East, but no concrete offers have been forthcoming. \nThe 25-year-old is contracted to the Roar for another year and will become a marquee player next season as part of his back-ended deal.
