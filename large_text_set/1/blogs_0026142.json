Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nChelsea were ready to quadruple Craig Gordon 's money – but Brendan Rodgers has slammed the door shut on the goalkeeper leaving Celtic on deadline day. \nRodgers says he is unaware of any second offer from the English giants to lure the Scotland No.1 to Stamford Bridge after a £2.5million bid was rejected last week. \nThe Daily Record report that the Premier League leaders are prepared to quadruple Gordon’s current Celtic wage packet from £12,500-per-week to a staggering £50,000, which is why the keeper has been so keen to be allowed to enter into signing talks. \nBut Celtic are set to counter that by doubling Gordon’s pay packet to £25k a week with Rodgers insistent the keeper will be between the sticks against Aberdeen tomorrow night.

So write that. That’s all you need to write. He will be in goal. End of story. \n“For me it’s always been clear. Craig will be here, he will be in goal on Wednesday night and we want to get him signed up on a new deal, simple as that. Craig Gordon has emerged as a shock target for Chelsea (Photo: REUTERS) \n“Antonio Conte will be in a similar position, he knows he’s got a goalkeeper that wants to go out and play, he’s been the No2, he’s been the support keeper for a few years now but he wants to play. \n“If there has been another bid then you know more than me. I’m not aware of it. There’s nothing new. There’s two parts to it, you can only speak to someone if another club meets a valuation of what a player is maybe worth.” \nRodgers said: “When there’s speculation around your players it means something is going okay. It’s been Moussa, Craig, Kieran and probably Boyata will be next. So it’s all good. My job is to control the background noise – don’t worry so much. But Brendan Rodgers insists his goalkeeper is going nowhere (Photo: Reuters) \n“We’re in total control. There’s no drama. I don’t think we’ll get in what we want to get in but we’ve got a great squad of players here. \n“I wanted to strengthen in January. I want to improve the team but only when the right players become available and I just don’t think it’s going to be. \n“We’ve made one fantastic signing in Eboue. We wanted a couple more but it’s not going to happen. I don’t waste my time worrying about it. We’ll get it done in the summer.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T11:04:04.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
