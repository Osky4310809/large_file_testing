I really do think people at Arsenal trust him and they’ve given him total trust. \n“I think he’s a great manager and he’s been fantastic. \n“He will go down in history as the greatest manager Arsenal have had and you’re probably talking about a manager who wants to manage for another five or six years by the sounds of it. \n“He’s still managing one of the great teams in Europe and they could finish in the top four and win the FA Cup.” \nPulis became public enemy number one in Arsenal fans’ eyes in 2010 when a reckless tackle from Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross left Aaron Ramsey with a badly-broken leg.
