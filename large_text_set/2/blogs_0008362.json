Sagebrush rebel. Western politics. Public lands owner. 8 mins ago Trump’s all-star team is led by two blue state Western senators Will Cory Gardner and Dean Heller continue to rubber-stamp President Trump’s anti-conservation agenda? Less than one month into President Donald Trump’s term, we’re learning who President Trump can lean on to pass his controversial agenda. Topping the list are Colorado Senator Cory Gardner and Nevada Senator Dean Heller. New research from the data journalists at FiveThirtyEight finds that no U.S. senators are more willing to ignore their constituency and rubber-stamp President Trump’s agenda than Senators Gardner and Heller, despite Colorado and Nevada voters soundly rejecting candidate Trump during the 2016 election. Source: The New York Times , 2016 Presidential Election Results Based on the vote margins from the 2016 presidential election, Senator Cory Gardner would be expected to support President Trump’s policies 58.1 percent of the time, while voting against the president 41.9 percent. So far, Senator Gardner has voted with President Trump 100 percent of the time. Similarly, Senator Heller would be expected to support President Trump’s policies 62.1 percent of the time, while voting against the president 37.9 percent based on Nevada’s 2016 presidential vote. Like Senator Gardner, Senator Heller has yet to cast a vote against President Trump’s policies. Source: FiveThiryEight, Tracking Congress in the Age of Trump—data as of Feb. 8, 2017 When it comes to the West’s public land and waters, these votes are anything but insignificant. Already, Senators Gardner and Heller have voted to eradicate the “ Stream Protection Rule ,” which was put in place to protect communities and drinking water supplies from toxic coal mining pollutants. Now that the U.S. Senate is considering even more controversial votes — including one to repeal a popular rule requiring oil companies to minimize waste of taxpayer-owned natural gas on public lands — we’re going to see whether Senator Gardner and Senator Heller will represent their constituents by voting against Congress’ and the Trump administration’s worst impulses. Blindly voting the party line is not what Coloradans or Nevadans expect from our elected officials and it’s certainly not a recipe for getting re-elected in the West. Public opinion research has shown us time-and-again that Westerners want our political leaders to fight for conservation and for public land protections — not undermine protections — and that we support common sense safeguards on oil, gas, and coal extraction. When Colorado’s newspaper of record, the Denver Post , endorsed Cory Gardner during his campaign against Senator Mark Udall in 2014, the editorial board lauded Senator Gardner as an independent centrist, arguing he would bring “fresh leadership, energy and ideas” to Washington. Thus far, Senator Gardner — like Senator Heller — hasn’t done much more than acquiesce to a historically unpopular president and his administration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T21:01:08.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
