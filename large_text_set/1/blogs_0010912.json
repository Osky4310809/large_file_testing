A press release from the company’s Japanese office claims that the rollout will begin on Monday, January 16.\nInterview with Honor VP Zack Zhang at CES 2017 The press release adds the update will also include the EMUI 5.0 upgrade, which will add a number of new features compared to the Honor 8’s current EMUI 4.1 version. The press release says the download will be 1.97GB in size.\nPreviously, Huawei sent out notices to media outlets stating the Honor 8 would get the Nougat and EMUI 5.o update sometime in February . It’s possible that Huawei Japan may have jumped the gun in terms of the rollout time period, but hopefully we will learn very soon whether or not this new date is accurate or not.\nJust a reminder: Huawei says that the update to EMUI 5.o will include a machine learning feature that should help with optimizing the phone by prioritizing frequently used apps. It will also allow the Honor 8 to run different user profiles, along with some security and power saving improvements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:42:08.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
