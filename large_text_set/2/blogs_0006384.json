(Photo: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nSeriously, is there a mirror between these two? Or, did a time machine crash causing irreparable damage, leaving Reese Witherspoon to raise her past self under the guise of her \"daughter\" Ava Phillippe? Probably not, but it's hard to discount those theories after viewing photos of the two at Tuesday's premiere of the HBO miniseries Big Little Lies at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. \nTwinning! (Photo: Steve Granitz, WireImage) \nBoth wore their hair pulled back with tendrils framing their nearly identical faces and long sleeve dresses, cinched at the waist that hit just above the knee. Ava, 17, wore a metallic frock by HANEY with gold, pointed pumps. Her mother, 40, wore a dress with a very similar silhouette, except for a thigh-high slit, by Elie Saab and accessorized with Tiffany & Co. jewelry. \nThe genes are strong in this one. (Photo: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nThe mother-daughter duo weren't the only ones to get our attention at the event. Kathreen Khavari used her photo op to respond to President Trump's immigration ban by donning a dress that doubled as a political statement. \nOne way to get a message across. (Photo: JIMMY MORRISON, EPA) \nIn a blog for The Huffington Post published in 2014, the actress explained why she wrote and starred in Brain of Terror , a short film about a woman who dreams she's a terrorist after binge-watching Showtime's Homeland starring Claire Danes. \n\"And so while I gave myself a chance to play,\" Khavari wrote, \"I also intended to show the world that identity is shaped by so much more than ethnic origin or the country in which one’s parents were born. Identity is complex, fluid, and can be ever-changing. Pigeon-holing a person or a group of people is not only damaging to humanity, but it’s beyond boring. Hopefully we’ll figure that out eventually.\" Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. The Kardashians are one famous example of mother-daughter lookalikes.
