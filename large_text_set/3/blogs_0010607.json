Between the time he bought a plane ticket and his departure date his little girl turned two. This caused a problem at the ticket counter because kids two and older must have their own seat. The airline employee told the man he couldn’t take his daughter with him unless he purchased a last minute ticket for a whopping $749. \nThe poor dad was rightfully upset and he explained to the ticket agent he couldn’t afford the ticket and he thought his daughter was fine to fly since she was still one at the time of purchase. Apparently the airline employee didn’t go out of her way to help and he just moved to the side and frantically started calling people. \nA woman stepped out of line and noticed this dad was visibly freaking out and asked what was wrong. He told the story and the woman proceeded to tell the ticket agent she wants to pay for his daughter. The employee told her the price and the stranger still insisted on buying the ticket. \nThe man asked for the stranger’s name so he could pay her back, but she told him not to worry about it. \nThat my friends, is what RAKs are all about. \nPeople went crazy over the story and even shared their own RAK stories: 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T03:47:06.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
