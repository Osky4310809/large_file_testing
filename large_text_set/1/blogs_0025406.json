As such, swiping on a notification gives you additional options (like blocking messages from a specific sender from getting to your lock screen or allowing you to block notifications from specific apps altogether. \nAt the bottom of the screen, there's a little bar/arrow to pull up, which reveals your most frequently used apps and a few 'challenges' (like seeing how few times you can unlock your phone in a day, for example) to try and keep things feeling fun. It's also free to use, which is a bonus. \nA potential drawback, however, is that it doesn't support fingerprint scanners as yet, it seems. You can lock the Defumblr screen with a PIN or pattern though. Defumblr puts your lock screen to use. / Â© AndroidPIT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T21:29:34.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
