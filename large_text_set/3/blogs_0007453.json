ADVERTISEMENT \nToday is International Women’s Day! The growth of woman-owned businesses is larger than it’s ever been, with a surge that really took off in 2016. \nIn fact, 2016 might have been the best year to-date to be a woman in business. Forbes reports that woman-owned companies increased by 18% between 2007-2016: the strongest peak then was in small businesses with between 50-99 employees. \nCompanies across the board and in virtually all industries are seeing a major increase in the involvement of creative, talented, influential women. The construction industry, for example, saw a massive 56% increase in the number of businesses owned by women over the last 9 years. \nCrossing paths with some incredible women in business over the past few years, through Twitter chats, Facebook and LinkedIn groups, and “IRL” at events has inspired me to honor these amazing ladies by putting together a list of 50 of the top women in business for International Women’s Day this March 8. \nA few notes before you start reading: I’ve placed the Twitter handles of all the women in marketing that I recommend following, and a few notable links of their stories where applicable, but don’t limit yourself to just following them on Twitter!
