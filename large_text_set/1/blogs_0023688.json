Why is Silver is Up Today? by Vince Lanci - Jan 27, 2017 12:13 PM \nTechnology has finally devised more efficient use of Silver in windshield heating to replace copper filament and decrease glare. And that means more silver will be used. And that, in turn, means more similar applications will be researched. U.S. Wage Disparity Rises To New Multi-Decade High During Obama's Last Year In Office Jan 26, 2017 8:05 PM 0 SHARES \nRoughly eight years ago, Obama infamously first shared with \"Joe the Plumber\" his plans to \"spread the wealth around.\" Unfortunately, at least for the like-minded socialists of the country, as data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals, he failed miserably. \nIn fact, as Bloomberg points out today, not only did income inequality not decline under Obama's reign, it actually surged to multi-decade highs with people in the 90th percentile of all earners bringing home over 5x the amount paid to people in the 10th percentile. \n\nOf course, as we pointed out in a post entitled \" Harvard Crushes The \"Obama Recovery\" Farce With 9 Simple Charts \", low-income wages have been stagnant, in real terms, since the mid-1970s. And, despite Obama's vow to \"spread the wealth around\", real wages for the poor actually suffered under his presidency. \n\nAs Bloomberg notes, wage disparity is supposed to be counter-cyclical, rising during periods of economic contraction and falling during expansionary periods. Which, obviously, begs the question of exactly how income disparity could be surging in light of Obama's stunning economic recovery that he so often bragged about. \nAmericans near the top of the income scale, whose weekly earnings exceed those of 90 percent of all full-time wage and salary workers, made at least $2,095 in a typical week last year, according to the report released Jan. 24. Those in the bottom 10 percent earned less than $415. \n\nIt's not all bad news: The latest figures show overall median weekly earnings for the 101 million workers 25 years or older last year climbed about 3 percent to $885, from $860 in 2015. The 2016 figures were reported by the Labor Department this week along with its fourth-quarter data from a survey of U.S. households. \n\nWage disparities tend to be counter-cyclical, rising during times of slower economic growth, and usually shrinking when the business cycle accelerates. Of course, inclusive policies and opportunities to move up the socioeconomic ladder also play a huge role. \n\nWhile the economy has grown at a historically modest 2.1 percent rate on average in the current expansion that began in mid-2009, the U.S. is almost at full employment now and the tight labor market has sparked hope that workers across the board will eventually see a lasting pickup in wage growth. Whether paychecks also reflect less inequality in coming years is anyoneâ€™s guess.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T00:53:22.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
