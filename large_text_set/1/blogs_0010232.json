Reliance Retail’s VoLTE feature phones to reportedly come with front and rear cameras By January 12, 2017 “The two feature phones are likely to be priced at Rs 999 and 1,500” \nAfter revolutionising the telecom sector in India through Jio, Reliance Retail is aiming to upend the feature phone space. It already has a roster of smartphones under the LYF brand, priced between Rs 3,000 and going all the way up to Rs 20,000, which offer decent specs along with VoLTE capabilities. But as earlier rumours have suggested, the Mukesh Ambani-owned company is aiming to bring the next-gen HD voice connectivity to the feature phones segment, with prices starting as low as Rs 1,000 . Now, a new report has shed more light on the phones. \nReliance Retail is expected to launch two feature phones in this quarter, priced at Rs 999 and Rs 1,500 respectively. While not much is known about their specifications, the report suggests that they might come equipped with both rear- and front-facing cameras. This means that users would also be able to use the handsets for video calls. Additionally, the phones will be preloaded with Jio’s app suite including Jio Chat , Live TV along with its digital wallet, Jio Money . \nAs per the analysts, Reliance Retail’s strategy will give a new life to the feature phone segment, giving consumers a more viable option than higher-priced smartphones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T09:41:09.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
