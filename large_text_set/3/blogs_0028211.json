(Winfrey, 63, has long been involved with the project and signed on as an executive producer when the book’s film rights were first acquired in 2010.) \nTony Award-winning Hamilton star Renée Elise Goldsberry will play Henrietta, though only in flashbacks — the story is told through Deborah’s eyes. It chronicles her search alongside journalist Skloot ( Rose Byrne ) to learn about the mother she never knew, exploring how the unlicensed harvesting of Henrietta’s cells led to unprecedented medical breakthroughs and changed medicine forever.

Vance , who plays Sir Lord Keenan Kester Cofield, a slick Southern con artist who tries to insert himself into the Lacks’ legal matters. Courtesy HBO \nReg E. Cathey plays Zakariyya, Henrietta’s youngest son and Deborah’s brother. (In addition to Zakariyya, Henrietta’s son David Lacks, Jr. and granddaughter Jeri Lacks served as consultants on the HBO project.) Courtesy HBO \n“The book connects the epic with the intimate, and that’s the movie’s ambition,” George C. Wolfe, who adapted and directed the movie, told Entertainment Weekly in December. \n“This woman’s cells helped heal the planet, yet her children were suffering,” he continued. “They didn’t know their mother’s story, even though they were living in the shadows of Johns Hopkins. I found that dichotomy incredibly moving.” \nThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks premieres April 22 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO.
