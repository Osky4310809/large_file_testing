Period.\nAs we start January 2017 there are no new additions to be made to the list. You still want an Xbox Elite Controller!\nBest overall Xbox Elite Controller \nSee at Microsoft \nMicrosoft really knocked it out of the park with the Xbox Elite Controller. At its core, it's the same great design that arrived with the Xbox One, which means it's well laid out and oh so comfy to use. But the Elite has been given a 'pro' makeover with grippy, soft-touch finishes, interchangeable rear paddles, thumbsticks, D-pad and trigger locks. The components are all made of a higher grade material, so they shouldn't wear out nearly as quickly under heavy use. Right now, this is the Ferrari of controllers for the Xbox, and with Windows 10 natively supporting it all you have to do is just plug in and play.\nBottom-line : For the controller best around, grab the Xbox Elite.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T15:07:28.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
