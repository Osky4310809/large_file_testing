Fagner replaced the Juventus star. \nFrancisco Arce brought in Rodrigo Rojas, Hernan Perez and Derlis Gonzalez for Victor Caceres, Dario Lezcano and Juan Iturbe after Paraguay edged Ecuador 2-1 last time out. \nNeymar was a clear target for Paraguay during the early exchanges, fouled on several occasions but the star man dusted himself off and got on with the job, almost setting up the opener in the sixth minute following a teasing delivery to Paulinho. \nParaguay impressed defensively and in attack, refusing to allow Brazil time on the ball and the visitors should have taken the lead seven minutes later when Gonzalez moved through on goal after some sloppy play from Miranda but the Dynamo Kiev forward scuffed his shot. \nBrazil finally broke Paraguay's stubborn resistance 10 minutes before the break via Coutinho. After checking inside and playing a neat one-two with Paulinho, the Liverpool star guided the ball beyond Antony Silva from the top of the penalty area. \nThe hosts came out all guns blazing in the second half and almost doubled the lead in the 49th minute but Paulinho was unable to add to last week's hat-trick - firing his volley wide of the post. \nA sliding Neymar then collided with the post, wasting a golden opportunity after being picked out by Coutinho. \nNeymar was in the thick of the action again moments later after winning a contentious penalty but his spot-kick was easily saved by Silva. \nBut Neymar eventually made up for his penalty miss just past the hour-mark. After dazzling his way through Paraguay's defence, his shot beat Silva, albeit with some help from a deflection as he moved within three goals of Romario for third place in Brazil's all-time goalscorers list. \nFull-back Marcelo capped the result with a delicate lofted effort over Silva with the outside of his boot in the closing stages.
