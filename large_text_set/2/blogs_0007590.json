On Sunday night, the singer performed her new single \" Chained to the Rhythm \" during the Grammy Awards. While the catchy beat certainly made us want to get up and dance, it was her politically charged message that was particularly moving. After singing about living in a world of ignorance, she ended her performance with a powerful display of the US Constitution. Of course, her message was met with a rupture of applause from the audience, including her friend Rihanna, who cheered from the crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:35:11.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
