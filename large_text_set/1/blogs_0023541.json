If you eat out for lunch every day, you might not think that it’s just $5 here, $10 there … but it adds up. On average, Americans spend nearly $3,000 on lunch each year — that’s more than enough for that new phone, the most elaborate tattoo ever, or even a used car. \nBringing your lunch is a huge win for you, but have you ever stopped to consider if your lunch packaging is a win for the planet? Like in the case of those little plastic bags you use to carry your PB&J sandwich. Those are a problem. Every year, the average person uses nearly one pounds worth of plastic sandwich bags. We know, we know … that doesn’t sound like it’s that big of a deal. But if we were to break that down into quantities, that would be a total of 540 plastic baggies a year that we use only once. \nYou may not realize it, but those single-use plastic bags stick around for a lot longer than any of us ever will. Forget about diamonds — plastic is forever and we are not doing nearly enough to combat this serious problem. Globally, we produce 300 million tons of plastic each year, but only a small percent is ever reclaimed or recycled. That isn’t even the scariest part. It’s estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans! \nSure, you can always reuse those plastic baggies until they’re beyond practical use — kudos to you if you do that, but there is a way that we can all do better. \n\nBy swapping those plastic baggies and plastic lunch boxes for more sustainable options, you are on your way to making a positive difference in your everyday life. 1. ECOlunchbox Three-in-One Stainless Steel Food Container Set \n\nBento boxes are perfect for transporting your lunch, like this ECOlunchbox Three-in-One Stainless Steel Food Container Set .

Thrive Home Products Premium Stainless Steel Insulated Thermos \nFor the colder months, nothing beats a hot bowl of soup for lunch — but transporting that to work or school comes with its own set of worries, namely the container opening up while you’re in transit and spilling soup all over your things.
