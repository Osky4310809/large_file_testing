But, while we dug the fact that the big company hosted the Super Bowl halftime show (which was incredible) this act of kindness by the CEO of PepsiCo was better than all of it.\nThe current CEO of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi, has been practicing something that’s borderline incredible . After realizing that a lot of compliments she received were focused on the successful way she was raised, she realized the importance that family has on a person. Not only can they be key influences, but they can shape someone’s personality and lead them towards success.\nSurely Nooyi, who’s currently 61, has gotten to the level she’s at based on a little encouragement from her mother, right? Exactly. So, she figured that in order to truly compliment her employees (and she’s got thousands of them) she might start by writing letters directly to their parents .\n“I was a product of my upbringing,” Nooyi said to Bloomberg ‘s David Rubenstein . “It occurred to me that I had never thanked the parents of my executives for the gift of their child to PepsiCo.” Surely it’s the best mail those parents have probably gotten in decades.\nThink that’s sweet? Just watch the video clip — it’ll make you feel incredibly inspired. “Our executives get very emotional about it,” she said. “[It’s] always a positive report card. I’m not going to write anything else.” What we love about Nooyi is that she knows how powerful a good letter is. In fact, she often uses letters to correspond with all of her employees about whatever is on her mind at the time, which surely creates a personalized bond.\n“My kids were going to college and I wrote a personal letter to everybody saying, ‘I’m going through tremendous separation angst,'” Nooyi said in the video. “I want them to know me as a person rather than just an executive.” It kind of sounds like Nooyi is the best boss ever.\nSo, for those of you who are looking for the best way to compliment your own staff? Maybe take a page out of Nooyi’s book, and start on the top.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:01:21.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
