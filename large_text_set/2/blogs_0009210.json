I think we’re all about good business,” McGregor said. \n“I’ve done great business with the UFC, with Dana (White), with everyone. I think it’s smoother if everyone just gets together and we get it involved. But again, everyone’s got to know their place. \n“Nobody is my boss. I know Floyd likes to say Dana (White) is my boss and this and he decides. Hell no. Nobody decides this. If they let people go fight jiu-jitsu tournaments, they can’t stop me going to fight a boxing fight. So obviously it’s smoother to do it all together, but look, everyone’s just got to know their place, and everyone does know their place.” \nUFC president Dana White poured cold water on that idea just last week, saying McGregor has an iron clad contract and that he intended to hold the UFC lightweight champion to it. \n“He’s under contract with us. You have a contract for a reason,” White told reporters. \n“Let me tell you what, there are a lot of contracts out there, no matter what business you are in — UFC or whatever — and it’s pretty tough to get out of a contract. \n“And if that’s what Conor wants to do (fight Mayweather), he’s got four fights left. He’s got four fights left with the UFC. Fight your four fights and, you know, go out and do what you want to do.” \nMayweather has not tasted defeat in 49 professional fights, but McGregor feels he will become the first man to stop the boxing legend. \n“I’ve got the reach. I’ve got youth. I’ve got the confidence. I’ve got the unpredictable style. You can’t prepare for a style like me,” McGregor said in a recent live stream interview. \n“Why conquer one world when you can conquer two? So I’m going to go conquer two worlds.” Originally published as Mayweather-McGregor reach deal Most viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:52:02.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
