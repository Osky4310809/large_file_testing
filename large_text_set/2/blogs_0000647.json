( AAPL ) breezed past analyst earnings expectations while posting its highest quarterly revenue on the back of record iPhone sales. The Cupertino company reported revenues of $78.3 billion, an increase of 9% from a year ago figures, on diluted earnings of $3.38 per share. Analysts had forecast an average of $77.38 billion in revenues with an EPS of $3.22. “We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,” Tim Cook, CEO of the company, stated in an earnings release. Apple’s performance this quarter is a return to profitability for the company after three quarters of slowing sales and its first revenue decline last quarter. The company’s stock price shot up in extended trading. As of this writing, it was trading at $125.39, an increase of 3.3% from its closing price.

But customers seem to have ignored analysts and reviewers as the phone waltzed to record-breaking sales of 78.2 million units, a 5% increase from the iPhone 6s’ sales from a year ago. In a Bloomberg interview , analyst Gene Munster said that “demand for the iPhone 7 Plus was strong when they [Apple] reported the September quarter and that strength carried on into December.” Furthermore, “We were surprised by the strength of iPhone 7 Plus where we were actually short of supply throughout the quarter. We’ve been able to come into supply-demand balance in January,\" Luca Maestri said.

The company is in search of new emerging markets and segments for its growth. As a result, it is making bold moves for its services segment. Not surprisingly, the company’s Mac line of computers and services, which were also up by 7% and 18% to $7.2 billion and $7.1 billion respectively, were the other contributors to the company’s profitability.

Sales for the iPad also witnessed a massive 22% decline. There are rumors that the company will release a large-screen iPad Pro this March or April. Apple’s revenue from its Other Devices segment, which includes the Apple Watch and Apple TV, also saw an 8% decline. This means that the increase in Apple Watch sales was not enough to offset the decrease in sales of other devices within that category. \nApple also announced a dividend of $0.57 per share of the company’s stock and forecast revenues between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, and a gross margin of between 38% and 39% for the coming quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T07:26:34.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
