This is horrible. Trans students are some of the most vulnerable people in our nation's school systems. Coming to terms with one's gender identity when you're young can be difficult enough - but when the government allows for students to be discriminated against, it makes matters even worse.As a transgender woman, I know firsthand how important it is to feel like I can move through public spaces safely. Join me in demanding the Trump administration reinstate these vital protections for trans students, so all of America's youth may be allowed to live freely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:19:24.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
