Dashboard camera footage of McDonald's death contradicted the officers' accounts of the incident, which contended that McDonald had come at them with a knife. The resulting protests after the footage was released helped to fuel the then-growing Black Lives Matter movement. An officer in the shooting has been charged with murder. McCarthy was fired by Mayor Rahm Emanuel earlier this year. \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

That is the highest number in two decades and a 58 percent increase over the previous year. \nMcCarthy said that there was a direct connection between that rising crime rate and the movement. \"There has been a political atmosphere of anti-police sentiment that has swept across this country over the last few years. The simplest way to describe it is that we have created an environment where we have emboldened criminals and we are hamstringing the police. That is creating a state of lawlessness.\" \nHe added that this was leading to an increase in shootings of police officers as well. \nHe argued that the movement was encouraging \"young people not to comply with police and legitimizing that non-compliance.\" \nMcCarthy was careful to say that there have been cases where police were responsible for unwarranted and tragic shootings in Chicago and elsewhere. Cops have to do a better job, he said. But he argued that the reaction to those cases should not be what drives law enforcement policy. \"Less than half of one percent of all of the shootings in this city [involve] police officers shooting civilians,\" he said.
