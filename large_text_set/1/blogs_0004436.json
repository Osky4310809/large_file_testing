Netflix has kept mum about the actual story for the upcoming dark comedy series, but now Drew Barrymore has revealed to USA Today what you can expect. Eager to find out? Read on to learn more about the Santa Clarita Diet secret. \nThis was the previous synopsis released by Netflix: “In Santa Clarita Diet, Joel (Timothy Olyphant, Justified) and Sheila (Drew Barrymore, Blended) are husband and wife realtors leading vaguely discontented lives in the L.A. suburb of Santa Clarita with their teenaged daughter Abby (Liv Hewson), until Sheila goes through a dramatic change sending their lives down a road of death and destruction…but in a good way.” \nNow, the newspaper adds: “We can reveal that the “dramatic change” Sheila undergoes in the series opener is, in fact, death. And while they tend to their open houses and teenage daughter, the couple must sate Sheila’s unbridled id and undead hunger, first with raw meat and, eventually, the human kind.” \nBarrymore talked more about her character: “What if she finds herself, and we do this sort of Cro-Magnon type of evolution with her over the course of the 10 episodes. No gimmicks, no prosthetics, just an awakening. I just really enjoyed just shedding a snakeskin with her, so it became a really fun obstacle that I wasn’t even planning for but seemed so conducive and fun and healthy for my own life.” \nBut we don’t know right away how she became undead. Showrunner Victor Fresco says: “Presumably, she has been exposed to something — although we don’t know what — which is making her feel a bit off.” \nThough it sounds pretty dark, Barrymore says it’s a positive show. “There’s a real optimism to the show. I don’t want to watch a show about a couple fighting and falling apart, I can’t handle it right now. It’s not heavy, but it’s not lacking in a sort of sweetness, if you will. But it’s also got bite and backbone and balls.” \nSanta Clarita Diet , also starring Liv Hewson, Skylar Gisondo and featuring guest stars such as Nathan Fillion, will be available globally on Netflix on February 3.
