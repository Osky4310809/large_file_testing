However, like most people, Mumbai charmed him, he stayed back, got married to a girl from Pune and, seven years later, put together a book that aims to show the humane face behind the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry in the city of dreams. \"I came here in 2010, and everything just sort of happened,\" he recalls. \"I started approaching people, and within six months I had almost half the book ready with me. I went on to approach some bigger stars too, over the years. However more than a celebrity book, my photos provide an insight into the whole entertainment industry. Right from big Bollywood stars, to TV actors, to even film students, you'll get to see them all.\"Mark's book is published by Harper Collins India, and consists of a foreword by Karan Johar and the afterword by casting mogul, Shanoo Sharma. The book also features stars like Kareena Kapoor Khan, Salman Khan, and Alia Bhatt to name a few. For a book that boasts of such a powerful insider access, Mark claims that everything kind of just \"fell in place.\" He explains, \"When I first move to Mumbai I didn't know a soul, and neither was I a Bollywood fan. However, once I started talking about my idea doors opened, the right people heard about it, and it all just happened. There are stars who also refused to be a part of the book, and I totally respected their decision. For me, as much as I wanted people to be a part of my book, I also wanted people to want to be featured in the book. It had to be a mutual thing.\"We have to ask him the big obvious question. With over 100 pictures from the industry, which ones are his favourite? He is quick to respond. \"I love the cover (which features Ranveer Singh). It was a difficult shot to take, and I love the way it has turned out. A few other shots that I love include Kareena Kapoor Khan, Chitrangada Singh, Saurabh Shukla, and Shilpa Shetty. I love the energy in these frames. They are so in the moment, simply taking it all in.\" \nHere are a few pictures from his book.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:13:18.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
