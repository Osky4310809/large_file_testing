Sydney news, sport and weather — On the Tele live blog LIVE Editor on duty: Michael Mehr and Adam Bennett \nOutgoing Australia Post chief executive Ahmed Fahour has taken another swipe at Pauline Hanson , asking if the senator has “an issue with the colour” of his skin. \nFahour yesterday confirmed he would step down from his role and used his resignation announcement to take a dig at Hanson, who was vocal in her criticism of his $5.6 million annual salary. \nAfter Hanson engaged in the slinging match on Twitter, Fahour decided to take another swing during an interview on The Project. \n“You know, what Senator Hanson should really work out: does she have a real issue with how Australia Post is performing or does she have an issue with the colour of my skin or my religion?” he said. \nSenator Hanson has taken aim at the Australia Post boss in a series of tweets, such as this post yesterday: “Ahmed Fahour quits. Says running Australia Post harder than owning a fish & chip shop. At least my shop never suffered a $221 MILLION loss!”.
