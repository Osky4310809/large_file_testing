In the end the show was a joke. Some of the participants were even seen in the dentist at Fort William needing treatment after eating chicken feed grit.\n‘It has not done this area any favours – it has just not lived up to expectations.’\nAt the time sources close to the show claimed that hunger, tiredness and boredom were the main reasons contestants had left, along with disillusionment with the concept.\nComparisons were also made to William Golding’s celebrated novel Lord Of The Flies after a split in the group saw many make the decision to offer rations to weaker members of the group, and life coach Tara Zieleman became the first contestant to leave after being branded ‘lazy’.\nMore: TV EBU goes to new lengths to accommodate Russia at Eurovision 2017 \nSamantha Womack still speaks to EastEnders co-star Rita Simons 'six times a day' \nThe TOWIE cast are heading off to film in Amsterdam and they want you to come along too \nThe premise of the show was to give contestants the chance to construct their own social utopia where they would hunt, live and sleep together in a remote community, while their every move is filmed by cameras over the course of a year.\nDescribing the show at the time, Liam Humphreys, Channel 4’s Head of Factual Entertainment, said: ‘Eden developed partly as a response to a growing malaise amongst the young with traditional political systems.\n‘It offers a simple insight, what would the world look like if we started again? It promises to be a bold idea, not least because of the scale of the concept but also because as programme makers we have no idea what will happen.’\nMORE: Scarlett Moffatt and Alan Carr are going to present a Channel 4 show together ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:34:31.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
