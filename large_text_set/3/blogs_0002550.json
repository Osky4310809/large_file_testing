His work was instrumental in enabling the country’s leap into the modern industrial age.\nWhile the landscape of the corporate world has transformed since then, his ideas remain as relevant. What were Tata’s big ideas that we can learn from?\nFirst, he believed in pioneering new enterprises essential for the nation. Much of his life was devoted to three such path-breaking ventures: steel, electric power and technical education, which he considered were fundamental to the country’s economic progress.\nFrom these ventures came fine institutions: Tata Steel, Tata Power and the Indian Institute of Science. His desire to build India’s first steel plant met instant cynicism.\nThe British Chief Commissioner for the Indian Railways famously said, “Do you mean to say that the Tatas propose to make steel rails to British specifications? Why, I will undertake to eat every pound of steel rail they succeed in making.”\nYet, by the time of World War 1 in 1914, the Tatas had exported over 1,500 miles of steel rails, and Tata’s son Dorab stated that the Indian Railways Chief Commissioner would have suffered a “slight indigestion” had he kept to his commitment.\nTata’s plan to create the country’s first institution for advanced scientific education was attacked as being impractical. He persisted, and invested his own personal funds in this enterprise that he called “his third son”.\nThe Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, stands tall today as one of the finest universities of science anywhere. Tata’s spirit of breaking new ground is best captured in three words that Ratan Tata has often used: Lead, never follow.\nBy staying true to this spirit, the Tata group has successfully broken ground in many new areas, whether in IT, digitisation, commercial vehicles and automobiles, salt, jewellery and global acquisitions such as Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley.\nA second lesson for our times is encapsulated in Tata’s views about the fundamental purpose of business. “In a free enterprise,” he had said, “the community is not just another stakeholder in the business, but infact the very existence of it.” He went on to add, “We do not claim to be more unselfish, more generous or more philanthropic than other people. But we think we started on sound and straightforward business principles, considering the interests of the shareholders our own, and the health and welfare of the employees the sure foundation of our prosperity.”\nThe interests of shareholders and employees are very important. But the community has to be the bedrock of the enterprise’s existence. There is no better testimony to this vision than the Tata Trusts.\nTata Trusts holds two-third of the equity of Tata Sons, the parent company of the group. The wealth that accrues from this asset supports a wide range of causes and institutions. The work of Tata Trusts ranges from healthcare, energy, rural uplift, education and urban poverty alleviation.\nFrom partnerships with Tata Memorial Hospitals in Mumbai and Kolkata, to the setting up of a national cancer grid connecting 87 hospitals across the country; from combating malnutrition to the eradication of malaria; from introducing technology to providing safe drinking water to disbursing financial assistance to young scholars, the Trusts’ funds are deployed towards a range of community development programmes.\nThis year, Tata Trusts celebrates 125 years of existence. With close to 900 projects through more than 450 partners, the Trusts reaches millions of households in 170 districts, across 17 states of India. The renewed mission is to sustainably impact 100 million beneficiaries by 2021.\nTrue to Tata’s vision, the community remains centre stage. It is a measure of Jamsetji Tata’s foresight that, even after 149 years, both his lessons — to lead and never follow, and to keep the community at the centre of the enterprise — feature prominently in the letter that Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran wrote to employees of the group on his very first day in office on February 21.\nSome lessons are timeless. And priceless.\nThe writer is Brand Custodian, Tata Sons", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:16:44.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
