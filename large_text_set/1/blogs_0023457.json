With New York’s Toy Fair convention on the horizon, Nerf has unveiled a new trio of blasters, including one which packs enough firepower to (probably) take down a small bear.\nThe Twinshock blaster (as pictured in slide one) comes equipped with ten barrels. Ten. That allows for two Mega projectiles to be fired simultaneously, or smaller darts to be shot one at a time. And that’s not all. By pumping the grip and holding the trigger down, Nerf-heads can fire five double-blasts in quick succession. Have fun pissing off your parents with this, and all for the reasonable price of $40 USD.\nJoining the Twinshock is the N-Strike Elite Accustrike Raptrostrike. Accuracy is the name of the game with this piece, and it comes with a pop-up sight and fully adjustable bi-pod and bolt action. Nerf claims the toy is up to 50 percent more accurate than any of its other products, which may go some way to explaining why it’s priced at $50 USD.\nRounding off the triumvirate is the fantastically titled Modulus Regulator. This baby is all about control, and allows the user to fire either one, three, or, if you’re really buzzed, continuous rounds. An electronic braking feature is also incorporated, allowing the user to halt their output should they get carried away.\nLook out for these beasts landing on the Nerf website in the near future.\nNow, check out the smartphone of tomorrow.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T20:17:05.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
