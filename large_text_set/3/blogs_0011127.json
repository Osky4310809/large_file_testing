I’m sure she felt a lot of pressure and was feeling nervous. But the “tolerant” Left doesn’t care, now do they? \nTrey Sanchez at TruthRevolt found some of the worst reactions around the web: \nThe usual suspect, Slate , mocked the entire ordeal and said Trump looked uncomfortable and like a miserable wife, trapped in an awful marriage. The outlet even pointed to the press pool report, saying it “diced the first lady into raw, quivering pieces” and showed “restrained contempt” and “unbearable awkwardness.” \nAnd then there is the general loathing found across the web. Here is a sampling across Facebook and Twitter. The “tolerance” is astounding: \n“Please don’t do this again. She doesn’t show the pictures in the book & you can barely understand her. It’s so hilariously sad!” \n“She sucks at this! She should try reading in her native Transylvanian. Because she’s effing up dr. Seuss! How are you going to read a picture book and not show anybody the pictures? How you gonna depress sick kids? Bring Back Michelle!!” \n“OMG THIS IS MISERABLE! Like these kids need more pain.” \n“y’all too much. Why does she read a children’s book like its a foreign language? Oh yeah she ain’t American…lmao” \n“Well…somebody got a stylist, a new designer outfit, a make up artist, an armored limousine and bothered secret service and body guards (courtesy of the tax payers) and left her golden cage aka Trump tower for an hour to bore these kids to death to play ‘First Lady’… money well spent (sarc)…. or that wasted money could have helped some of these kids with their treatment or paid for their college education… no connection, no credibility…” \nRemember when people attacked Michelle Obama when she read to kids? Yeah, me neither. \nAnd why in the world did they make fun of Melania’s accent? First of all, that’s a no, no as leftists tell us all the time. But secondly, did they forget she speaks five languages? (Slovenian, English, French, Serbian, and German.) How dare they insult a woman’s intelligence. Isn’t that a no, no, too? \nClick CONTINUE to see the sweet moment:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T04:43:53.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
