Around 2,000 women claimed they were sexually assaulted in Cologne, Hamburg and other German cities on New Year's Eve 2015 EPA \nMr Katrein, who says he worked for the National Security Office (NBH) and then the Constitution Protection Office (AH) between 2000 and 2013, described the Russian threat to Europe as a “nine or ten” out of ten. \nHe told Hungarian news website index.hu how he followed events in Cologne closely. FBI 'investigating role of Breitbart in spreading fake news with bots' \nThere was confusion as to exactly how many suspects were refugees, however. \nMr Katrein said: “When it comes to the events in Cologne, or other sexual offences, they (Russia) are active in emphasising that the German or Western authorities and the media are attempting to cover up these crimes. \n“This is true (that the majority of Cologne offenders were migrants and were linked to criminal groups) [but] this was communicated in an interesting way in Russian media and others taking stories from it. \n“They were not newly arrived migrants, but in that interpretational environment it did not matter.” \nMr Katrein also described the Russians as having “serious professional experience and traditions” in playing up news stories. \nCologne pledges tight security for Carnival celebrations \nHe also described how Russian officials, such as foreign minister Sergei Lavrov , reacted to “phantom stories on a really high level” including the “Lisa case”. \nThe 'Lisa case' centred around a 13-year-old Russian-German girl who claimed to have been abducted and raped by Arab migrants in Berlin last January. \nThe viral story triggered protests and Russian officials accused the German government of trying to cover up the crime. \nHowever, an investigation by German police found mobile phone records contradicted her account of what had happened, and that there was no evidence she had been raped. \nShe later retracted the story , but it led to a souring of diplomatic relations between Russia and Germany, where officials accused Moscow of stoking anti-immigrant sentiment to undermine support for Angela Merkel . \nMr Katrein also claimed Hungarian state media was reporting Russian propaganda as objective news. \n\"I am not only talking about the wiretapping scandal,” said Mr Katrein. “I consider articles on the Hungarian public media broadcasting [to be] a lot of messages taken from the Kremlin’s propaganda. \n“[This is] a serious warning for the counter-intelligence profession, as the public media should be under special national security protection according to the law. \n“These analyses should be done by the secret service, not by journalists.” \nPutin jokes that 'Russian borders don't end'. \nThe Hungarian government has tried to distance itself from Russia since the last remaining 40,000 Soviet troops left the Eastern bloc in June 1991. \nBut current Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – described mockingly by opponents as “Little Putin” - has been accused of cosying up to their big neighbours. \nHe previously said he wants Hungary to be an “illiberal democracy” modelled on “strong states” such as Russia. \nAround 2,000 Hungarians marched in protest against Mr Putin’s state visit in Budapest in 2015.
