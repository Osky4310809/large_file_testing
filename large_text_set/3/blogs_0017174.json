As a practical matter, the budget may stand little chance of passing intact. But as a political statement, it represents a new way of doing business. \nAdvertisement   “To keep Americans safe, we have made the tough choices that have been put off for too long,” Mr. Trump wrote in the introduction to the budget proposal. “But we have also made the necessary investments that are long overdue.” Not surprisingly, Mr. Trump’s budget would sharply ratchet back American investment in the outside world. The United States would cut back financing for international peacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, cultural exchanges, refugee assistance and third world development. The United Nations , the World Bank and other institutions would no longer find themselves as flush with American dollars.

Credit Toby Talbot/Associated Press What his budget proposal makes clear, however, is that such cuts, deep as they are, would not be enough by themselves to pay for his reinvestment in the armed forces, meaning that Mr. Trump had to turn to programs that might be defined by others as America-first in their orientation and goals. \nAdvertisement   The tough choices he promised would eliminate longstanding staples of American life. Gone would be federal financing for public television, the arts and humanities. Federal support for long-distance Amtrak train service would be eliminated. Washington would get out of the business of helping clean up the Chesapeake Bay or the Great Lakes. While he may not care about East Coast elites upset about ending financing for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, some of the agencies and programs that would be “zeroed out” are institutions in parts of the country that Mr. Trump won last November. \nAdvertisement   Among the agencies to be cut off, for instance, would be the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal-state agency founded in 1965 to promote economic development and infrastructure in some of the poorest parts of the United States. Mr. Trump and his aides argue that many of these programs have long since passed their usefulness or would be better off run and paid for at the state or local level. While he talked about the ravaged inner cities in his Inaugural Address, Mr. Trump would eliminate $3 billion in funding for the Community Development Block Grant program that helps provide affordable housing. The president argued in his budget that “the program is not well targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
