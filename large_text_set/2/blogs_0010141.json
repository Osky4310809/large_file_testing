Kofi Outlaw Back to Article Image of \nThe LEGO Batman Movie is now out in theaters, bringing the Batman mythos and franchise lore to the LEGO Universe. As we say in our official review, one of the greatest joys of LEGO Batman is the filmmakers' deep knowledge of the character's history and the industry politics surrounding him. \nIn making a superhero movie (even a LEGO one), some fans may be wondering if The LEGO Batman Movie has a post-credit scene ( aka a mid- credits or \"button\" scene) - especially now that the LEGO movie universe is officially a thing. \nThese days many fans are trained to sit through the entire end credits of a movie no matter what; however, for those who don't like hanging out in the theater any longer than they have to, we answer the question of Whether or Not The LEGO Batman Movie has a post-credits scene . (MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW!) **** ** * \nSorry DC movie fans, The LEGO Batman has no fun end-credits, mid- credits or button scene for the next chapter in the LEGO movie saga. Batman and Co. have great fun closing out the film (complete with a musical number) but when it all ends, it's done. \nSure, it would have admittedly been nice (and fitting) to at least have an end-credits scene that at the very least poked fun at the superhero genre's penchant for end-credit scenes - or even something like Will Arnett's Batman boasting about how many movies he's in - and how many he's about to be in. \nOh well. The LEGO Batman Movie delivers a great time during its actual runtime , so there's no real loss that we didn't get all the bells and whistles... --- \nHave you seen LEGO Batman yet?
