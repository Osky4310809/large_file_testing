The ingredients work alongside oxygen in the air and a replaceable magnesium “power bar” to create positive and negative electrodes, which in turn generates electricity. \nIf you buy it from a foreign supplier like this one that imports products from overseas, you can expect to pay around $57 for the lamp, which is quite a markup.
