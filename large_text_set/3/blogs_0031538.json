I never seen anything like that before.” \nShe told WISH she moved her kids to another aisle “because they got very scared at that point and then I heard him say ‘I’m going to kill everyone in here.’“ \nThe man reportedly became angry while trying to convert an employee to Islam, the station said. \nFraley told WISH that a female employee tried to intervene and deescalate the situation, calmly offering to talk with the man outside. \nNo dice. \n“He violently grabbed her around the neck and just was punching and whatever he could to her,” Fraley told WISH. “A bunch of employees came out to keep him away from customers.” \nWhen police arrived, they found Khalid Bilal confronting store employees — and then he broke an officer’s hand who tried placing him in custody, the station said. \nBilal then charged at another officer and was promptly tased, WISH reported, which allowed police to put him in handcuffs. But the 24-year-old started kicking a cop, so police had to shackle his legs, the station said, adding that he was yelling “Allah Akbar” amid the mayhem. \nPolice said Bilal continued attacking officers as they tried to restrain him on the way to a hospital, WISH reported, and once there, he hit an officer three times who tried securing a restraint holding Bilal to a hospital bed. \nBilal faces preliminary charges of battery on police, resisting law enforcement, disorderly conduct, battery with injury, intimidation and strangulation in connection with the Saturday incident, the station reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:31:56.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
