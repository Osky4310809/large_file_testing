Just concerned. \nShe’s a citizen. A voter. Not a hooligan. Not a paid protester. \nA person. \nRELATED: Rep. McSally hosts a tense town hall \nShe and a group of voters from Rep. David Schweikert’s 6th Congressional District have been wanting to express their views to their representative for some time, without much luck. On Thursday, as is their usual practice, they went to Schweikert’s Scottsdale office hoping to get in a word with the congressman. \nThis week members of congress are in recess. Most back at their home districts. \nA few of the members of Sheoran’s small group of constituents brought cookies to the congressman’s office. \nSomeone in Schweikert’s office called the cops.

As this is Recess Week we decided to try to get some time. Maybe a town hall where we can politely ask him questions. No luck there.” \nMONTINI: Cowardly cowering congressmen \nThe police officers were nice enough. I can’t say for sure if they were offered or accepted a snack. \nIn the meantime, Schweikert's constituents have decided to stage their own town hall, and have invited the congressman to a meeting from 7-8:30 pm. Friday at Shadow Rock Congregational Church, 12861 N. 8th Avenue in Phoenix. \nOrganizers expect 200 constituents to attend. They're hopeful but not optimistic the congressman will show up. After all, there was no sign of Schweikert when the constituents showed up at his office Wednesday. \nBy the way, this is a congressman who has publicly expoused free expression, tweeting: Freedom of press & expression is vital for a democracy to thrive — Rep David Schweikert (@RepDavid) March 5, 2016 \nI suppose he simply doesn't want constituents to express their opinions to him. \nThe nice ladies came bearing cookies. They left with nothing. \nThese days, that's how the congressional cookie crumbles.
