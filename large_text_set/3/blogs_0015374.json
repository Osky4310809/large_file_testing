For Plishner, the entire marketing build-up of the film's premiere was centered on the trailer release. \nThe film won't be in theaters for another five months. To generate buzz, they created three versions of the trailer: one in traditional 16:9, another in 1:1, and the last in 9:16. The reason? 80-90% of viewers the trailer targets will be viewing it on mobile. A tal e of two (or three) trailers \nHere is the horizontal version of the Baby Driver trailer that went live after the world premiere: \nIf you head to the Baby Driver Facebook page on mobile, you can see the 9:16 trailer for the film. It looks like the below on a desktop, but on mobile, it fills the whole screen: \nPlishner pointed out that they also released the trailer in square format. Here's a screenshot of what the native Facebook video looks like on desktop view on the Baby Driver page : \n\"This is the first big campaign we're doing with vertical video,\" said Plishner. \"After frequency studies about vertical video and live video, we're seeing that the attention and interest is two to three times higher with [vertical] assets. We're testing it out. We want to put butts in seats for the film.\" A trailer for the trailer \nYou may have noticed that, in addition to the three different trailers for each viewing experience, the team added a 5-second mini-trailer bumper. \n\"Sometimes people are like goldfishâ€”they have a three-second attention span,\" said Plishner. \"You have to hook them. It's the opposite of TV, where you end on a cliffhanger. Here, you have to lead with the cliffhanger. So we experimented with adding a 5-second bumper.\" \nWhat do you think of the different versions of the trailer? Would you consider cutting a version of your next trailer for mobile?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T15:33:07.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
