This issue recently resurfaced after a nasty argument broke out in a private Facebook group dedicated to the Killer Instinct scene. According to statements provided to PVP Live by community member Rodolfo “Rotendo” Camarena, the controversy started as a simple discussion about the character Shadow Jago before turning into a tirade about a certain player’s proclivity for teabagging during matches. Eventually, the discussion devolved to threats, leading to a shutdown of the thread. That’s when Killer Instinct World Cup organizer Brandon Alexander reminded everyone of the teabagging ban at his event, claiming that the taunt would continue to be prohibited during the next installment. The player who originally resorted to violent rhetoric was also asked to openly apologize to the group or be banned from future events.\n\nAs word began to spread, people from all corners of the fighting game community began to weigh in on the ruling. Some regarded it as a necessary evil to keep attitudes in check in what can be a heated environment, but most saw the rule as simply unenforceable. How, they asked, would you be able to impose such a punishment? How many crouches constitutes teabagging? Are developer-intended taunts (a mainstay in most fighting games) banned as well? Where do we draw the line?\n\nAdvertisement \n\n“The teabagging rule set by the Killer Instinct World Cup is something I hope the fighting game community does not lean towards,” Mortal Kombat X champion Dominique “Sonic Fox” McLean shared in a quick Twitter thread. “Do not limit players or deny them of trying to express themselves. I often use teabagging as a way to make the opponent crack or get angry. It’s dirty but efficient if they get tight easily.”\n\nGIF The reigning Capcom Cup champion, Du “NuckleDu” Dang, also employs this strategy to great success. Throughout the tail-end of Street Fighter IV competition and on into the early months of Street Fighter V , NuckleDu regularly taunted and teabagged his opponents as a way to amp himself up, get in the other player’s head, or make them second-guess his next move. The young competitor would sometimes spend absurd amounts of time putting on and removing Guile’s sunglasses, only to win his match and offer a sheepish grin to the opponent. Like it or not, it’s simply part of NuckleDu’s game.\n\nCompetitors of all stripes are often applauded for showing good sportsmanship and respect to their fellow players, but some players also want to have a psychological advantage over opponents, and methods like teabagging are seen as acts that can put your opponent on edge. Like the antics of famed boxer Muhammad Ali, a well-placed taunt in the world of fighting games can do wonders if your goal is to tilt the person playing next to you. And while tournament organizers generally keep an eye on real-world celebrations to ensure they don’t veer into the realm of harassment, rarely are limitations put on how players are allowed to conduct themselves in-game, making Alexander’s apparent dedication to this specific rule something of an anomaly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:36:46.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
