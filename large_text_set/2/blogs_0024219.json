He was due to be joined by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly later for talks the White House said would “walk through” the implementation of Trump’s immigration orders.\nKelly signed the guidelines issued by his department on Monday.\nMexico ‘s lead negotiator with the Trump administration, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, said there was no way Mexico would accept the new rules, which among other things seek to deport non-Mexicans to Mexico .\n“I want to say clearly and emphatically that the government of Mexico and the Mexican people do not have to accept provisions that one government unilaterally wants to impose on the other,” he told reporters at the Foreign Ministry.\nHe said the issue would dominate the talks, taking place on Wednesday and Thursday. Mexico will insist that the United States proves the nationality of any person it wants to deport to Mexico , he said.\n“We also have control of our borders and we will exercise it fully,” he said, adding that Mexico was prepared to go the United Nations to defend the freedoms and rights of Mexicans under international law.\nRoberto Campa, who heads the human rights department of the Interior Ministry, said the plan to deport non-Mexicans to Mexico was “hostile” and “unacceptable.”\nSenators for the leading leftist opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, said Tillerson and Kelly were not welcome in the country and they urged Pena Nieto not to meet with them.\n‘PHENOMENAL’ RELATIONSHIP \nIn Washington, White House spokesman Sean Spicer described U.S.- Mexico ties as healthy and robust and said he expected a “great discussion.”\n“I think the relationship with Mexico is phenomenal right now,” Spicer told reporters.\nHomeland Security’s guidance to immigration agents is part of a broader border security and immigration enforcement plan in executive orders that the Republican president signed on Jan. 25.\nIn Guatemala on Wednesday, Kelly told Guatemalans the immigration crackdown ordered by Trump meant undocumented immigrants would be caught and sent back quickly, advising them to stay at home.\nHe denied the administration was embarking on mass deportations.\nMexico ‘s agenda at the talks on Thursday includes border infrastructure, deportation strategies, Central American migration, narcotics, arms trafficking and terrorism, and the North American Free Trade Agreement, a senior official with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:17:59.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
