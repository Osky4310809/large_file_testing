Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images Libya Russian special forces sent to back renegade Libyan general – reports \nDeployment just over the border in Egypt could be in support of commander Khalifa Haftar and aimed at gaining leverage over Libya’s eventual ruler   03.15   03.28 GMT \nRussia appears to have deployed special forces to an airbase in western Egypt near the border with Libya in recent days, according to US, Egyptian and diplomatic sources, in a move that adds to US concerns about Moscow’s deepening role in Libya . \nThe US and diplomatic officials said any such Russian involvement might be part of a bid to support the Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar, who suffered a setback with an attack on 3 March by the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) on oil ports controlled by his forces. Libya falls back into civil war as rival sides fight to control oil terminals Read more \nThe US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States had observed what appeared to be Russian special operations forces and drones at Sidi Barrani, about 60 miles (100km) from the Egypt-Libya border. \nEgyptian security sources offered more detail, describing a 22-member Russian special forces unit, but declined to discuss its mission. They added that Russia also used another Egyptian base farther east in Marsa Matrouh in early February. \nThe apparent Russian deployments have not been previously reported. \nThe Russian defence ministry did not immediately provide comment on Monday and Egypt denied the presence of any Russian contingent on its soil. \n“There is no foreign soldier from any foreign country on Egyptian soil. This is a matter of sovereignty,” army spokesman Tamer al-Rifai said. \nThe US military declined to comment. US intelligence on Russian military activities is often complicated by its use of contractors or forces without uniforms, officials say. \nRussian military aircraft flew about six military units to Marsa Matrouh before the aircraft continued to Libya about 10 days later, the Egyptian sources said. \nReuters could not independently verify any presence of Russian special forces and drones or military aircraft in Egypt. \nMohamed Manfour, commander of Benina air base near Benghazi, denied that Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) had received military assistance from the Russian state or from Russian military contractors, and said there were no Russian forces or bases in eastern Libya. \nSeveral western countries, including the US, have sent special operations forces and military advisers into Libya over the past two years. The US military also carried out air strikes to support a successful Libyan campaign in 2016 to oust Islamic State from its stronghold in the city of Sirte. \nQuestions about Russia’s role in north Africa coincide with growing concerns in Washington about Moscow’s intentions in oil-rich Libya, which has become a patchwork of rival fiefdoms in the aftermath of a 2011 Nato-backed uprising against the late leader Muammar Gaddafi, who was a client of the former Soviet Union. \nThe UN-backed government in Tripoli is in a deadlock with Haftar and Russian officials have met with both sides in recent months. Moscow appears prepared to back up its public diplomatic support for Haftar even though western governments were already irked at Russia’s intervention in Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad. \nA force of several dozen armed private security contractors from Russia operated until February in a part of Libya that is under Haftar’s control, the head of the firm that hired the contractors told Reuters. \nThe top US military commander overseeing troops in Africa, marine General Thomas Waldhauser, told the US Senate last week that Russia was trying to exert influence in Libya to strengthen its leverage over whoever ultimately holds power. \n“They’re working to influence that,” Waldhauser told the armed services committee. \nAsked whether it was in the US interest to let that happen, Waldhauser said: “It is not.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T05:57:47.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
