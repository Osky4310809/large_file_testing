But in this economy, 4G enabled devices do not respond merely to wishful thinking, but to deep pockets. \nThat is perhaps why Telecoms giant, Globacom is not only providing 4G coverage, but offering its subscribers the opportunity to get free 4G LTE Smartphones. With the new development, customers can get 4G LTE smartphones when they buy a special LTE data plan on the network. \nTelephone subscribers \nThe company said in a press statement that the offer, which is expected to excite telephone subscribers in Nigeria, would enable Glo subscribers who did not have 4G smartphones to enjoy the exceptional speed of the advanced Glo 4G network. For instance, a subscriber who purchases 75G LTE data plan for N75, 000 will get a smartphone worth N75, 000 with exciting features such as 13 Megapixel camera, dual SIM, a 5-inch screen and 2GB RAM. \nFor a 60GB 4G data plan for N60,000, Globacom said the subscriber would get an 8 megapixel 4G smartphone worth the same amount absolutely free, while a 48GB data plan worth N48,000 will give the subscriber a 5 Megapixel camera smartphone worth the same amount, also free. \nBoth 4G LTE smartphones are also dual SIM-enabled. Both offers have 1GB RAM. Globacom also said that all the “phones are ideal for 4G, 3G, and 2G networks.” “Glo Mobile offers the most innovative services and data plans at affordable rates. With this special free 4G LTE smartphone offer, we have once again demonstrated our resolve to always give our subscribers the best value. It cannot get better than this,’’ Globacom concluded.
