(Source: IE image) \nA report by TeleAnalysis that cites sources familiar with the matter claims that Reliance Jio may extend its Prime membership deadline by a month. This news has emerged after a lukewarm response from the customers but no final decision has been taken so far. This is good news for all the Reliance Jio members since the Jio Happy New Year was set to end on 31st March. The report also says that Jio has managed to add only 22-27 million users as its Prime members which are only 50 percent of its initial target. \nHowever, the service provider is yet to confirm these numbers and hasn’t made any official announcement about it. Despite this slow response, things aren’t that bad for Reliance Jio as a recent survey conducted by a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch revealed that as many as 82 percent of respondents were happy with the service and wanted to stick with it. The major reason given by them was its free calls and data services. The survey was conducted on a sample size of about 1,000 Jio users online. \nYou may also want to watch: \nThe Jio membership plan was introduced by Mukesh Ambani at an event where he also confirmed that Jio has added 100 million subscribers so far. Under the membership, Jio users were offered services for a one-time fee of Rs 99. This allowed the users to be a part of the membership for unlimited time. Users will have to pay a monthly tariff of Rs 303 per month to continue the services till March 31. \nHowever, the Jio Happy New Year offer allows the users the to make unlimited voice and video calls for 28 days along with providing them with 1GB data. The existing Jio users can avail this service by going to the MyJio app or through Jio’s official website. Reliance Jio also announced a ‘buy one, get one’ offer recently to attract more users. This scheme makes Jio Prime prepaid users additional free data benefits and cashback offers.
