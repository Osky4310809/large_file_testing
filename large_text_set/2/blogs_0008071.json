Advertisement \nWhile announcing a deal surely worth millions, the NBA curiously neglected to also announce raises for the hundreds of D-Leaguers who make minimum wage-equivalent salaries, and will soon become walking billboards for a popular sports drink company worth billions of dollars. \nEach D-League team has a salary cap of $209,000, with a roster limit of 12. D-Leaguers sign one-year contracts with the league, and receive one of two salaries: $26,000 or $19,500. Each team may only have up to five players with the $26,000 “A-level” contracts, meaning the majority of players make $19,500. That’s actually an improvement, as until this season, the majority of players made just $13,000. The federal poverty level for single person households is $12,050. Advertisement \nThe NBA, obviously, has the money to pay all D-Leaguers living wages, but despite skyrocketing revenue in recent years, seems unwilling to do so. There were hopes that the recently agreed upon Collective Bargaining Agreement extension would address D-League salaries, but the only provision that does so is the introduction of “two-way” contracts that would pay two players per team between $50,000 and $75,000, and may not actually be all that good for them . \nThe NBA wants the D-League to be a laboratory for the next generation of coaches, front-office executives, and referees, and for the best non-NBA players in the world to ply their trade in the D-League and earn a call-up. And they’ve taken a number of strides in that direction, most significantly with 25 NBA teams now owning or having a one-to-one affiliation with a D-League team; soon that number will hit 30. But as long as basketball players can earn significantly more money playing in a dozen or more European countries, they will do so. \nNone of this is very surprising, exactly. Once upon a time, professional athletes across all sports also weren’t paid living wages, and future Hall of Famers and end-of-the-roster scrubs alike had to work offseason jobs. To simplify the story of many long and hard-fought battles , players banded together against owners for higher wages, and won. Perhaps it’s time for D-Leaguers to do the same .
