That is, until the inevitable reboot or sequel because, like horror-movie villains, genre franchises are often hard to kill. \nBut music, books and TV are equally awash with entertaining examples that rose from their dead — sometimes literally. Here are some that have proven harder than others to stay final: \nGene Simmons of Kiss performs live in Australia in 2013.

But a funny thing happened on the way to retirement: In 2002, the band unretired and have since done numerous tours (though Simmons and Stanley are the only remaining original members), been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and even bought a now-defunct L.A. arena football team. Those Kiss caskets and pinball machines don’t just sell themselves, you know. \nJason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is on a rampage in 'Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday.' (Photo: New Line Cinema) \nFRIDAY THE 13TH \nStarring the machete-wielding, hockey-masked Jason Voorhees, the Friday the 13th horror franchise has had two “final” films: 1984’s The Final Chapter and 1993’s Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday . Usually going to hell will put the kibosh on future endeavors, yet Jason later went to space (in 2002's Jason X ), met Freddy Krueger (2003's Freddy vs. Jason ) and has been rebooted not once but twice, with 2009's Friday the 13th and another one — which happens to be the 13th Friday — that arrives Oct. 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T20:14:00.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
