It seems that tag was only so the Rams could avoid losing their star corner for nothing. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported Tuesday the Rams have discussed deals for Johnson with \"several teams,\" though it appears nothing is imminent. Johnson, 27, signed his franchise tender Monday. The deal guarantees him a $16.7 million salary for the 2017 season, making him the NFL's highest-paid cornerback. “I feel blessed, honored and really grateful to the organization for placing the tag on me for the second year,\" Johnson said in a statement . \"It starts at the top—from Mr. Kroenke, to Les Snead and to Coach McVay, I’m thankful. This is my third contract and I’m back with my brothers, my teammates again. I’m glad that I get to come back and play with these guys another season and I’m excited to be back.” Signing the tender does not necessarily lock him into the $16.7 million salary. The Rams (or another team) may negotiate a long-term deal with a franchised player until July 15. Johnson recorded 57 tackles and a career-low one interception in 2016 when he also played under the franchise tag. Los Angeles essentially chose tagging Johnson over retaining Janoris Jenkins, who signed a long-term deal with the New York Giants. Pro Football Focus ranked Johnson as the 26th-best cornerback in football last season. While that makes him an unquestioned starter and potential lower-tier top cornerback on a defense, he is not a shutdown option around whom you can build a secondary. Paying him $16.7 million in one fell swoop (and nearly $31 million over a two-year period) seems like a misallocation of resources. If Johnson plays out his franchise tag in 2017 and performs even at the same level he did a year ago, it's possible he could wind up raking in money that would make him one of the richest corners in NFL history. In that sense, like Kirk Cousins, he has very little incentive to sign a long-term deal unless it's one with astronomical guarantees. With a new coaching staff in place, those financial constraints are the likely impetus for the Rams testing the trade market. Odds are any team that trades for Johnson will want to work out a long-term deal before pulling the trigger.
