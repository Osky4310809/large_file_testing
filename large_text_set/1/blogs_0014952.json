Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac \nApple will launch a new 15-inch MacBook Pro later this year powered by Intel’s next-generation Kaby Lake processors and 32GB of desktop-class RAM, according to one reliable analyst. \nThe latest models feature Skylake chips and up to 16GB of RAM, but many professionals have complained this just isn’t enough for a high-end notebook. \nThat Skylake processor is the reason why the latest MacBook Pro maxes out at 16GB of RAM; it just doesn’t support low-power RAM in larger configurations. So, if Apple wanted to offer 32GB, it would have to use desktop-class RAM that eats away at battery life a whole lot faster. \nApple could design its own chips for the MacBook lineup to get around this, but for now, the company seems to be settled with Intel. And rather than wait for Intel to design a mobile chip that supports 32GB of low-power RAM, it’s just going to give in to fans’ demands. \nAccording to reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has a MacBook Pro refresh planned for later this year that will bring new Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 32GB of desktop-class RAM. It will be “the most significantly redesigned product this year,” Kuo says. The machine will serve pro users — like video editors — who require more than 16GB and are willing to sacrifice some battery life to get their hands on it. Kaby Lake will also grace the rest of the MacBook Pro lineup — and the 12-inch MacBook, too, Kuo claims.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro and the more affordable 15-inch models will reportedly max out at 16GB of RAM just like they do today. It’s thought there will also be a 16GB RAM option for the 12-inch MacBook, which currently maxes out at 8GB. \nKuo expects the new 12-inch MacBook to enter mass production this spring, while the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro with up to 16GB of RAM will follow in the third quarter. The 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM will enter mass production in the fourth quarter. \nKuo actually refers to that beefier 15-inch option as a “MacBook,” but given its high-end specifications and larger display, we are assuming it will be part of the MacBook Pro lineup. \nThanks to those more efficient Kaby Lake processors, Kuo expects MacBook Pro shipments to continue growing at around 10 percent year-over-year. He also believes shipments will come quicker now that Apple has ironed out early production issues. \nKuo doesn’t mention specific release dates for any of these machines, but he expects the MacBook with 32GB of RAM to arrive sometime during the second half of 2017 — at which point Apple could reduce the price of the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T13:28:40.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
