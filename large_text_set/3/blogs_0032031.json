Diego Reyes was the hero for Mexico, scoring the game's lone goal in the second half. The Mexicans have yet to lose in four contests in the Hexagonal round, creating a nice cushion for themselves as they look to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Indeed, Mexico appears to be well on its way, as Eric Gomez of ESPN Deportes noted: Eric Gomez @EricGomez86 The results are all that matters on the road to Russia. 10/12 for Mexico so far despite some shaky passages of play. 2018, here they come. 3/29/2017, 12:52:30 AM The game wasn't without controversy. Trinidad and Tobago appeared to go ahead in the 33rd minute on Joevin Jones' left-footed blast in the box, but he was deemed offside. Replays appeared to show that he was just onside, however. Mexico, meanwhile, managed a few chances in the opening 45, with Javier Hernandez coming the closest in the ninth minute. Chicharito managed to get a head on Carlos Salcedo's brilliant cross into the box, but Trinidad and Tobago's Jan-Michael Williams came up with a key save. Manager Juan Carlos Osorio didn't seem pleased with his team in the first frame, as Tom Marshall of ESPN FC noted: Tom Marshall @mexicoworldcup Osorio a bag of energy on the sideline. He is not at all happy. Mexico lacking intensity and creativity here #eltrieng 3/28/2017, 11:35:06 PM It didn't take Mexico long to break the deadlock in the second half, however. Miguel Layun whipped a corner into the box in the 58th minute and found the head of Reyes, who smashed his headed effort into the top of the net past a helpless Williams. It wasn't a shock that Reyes came up with the important goal, as Gomez tweeted : Eric Gomez @EricGomez86 LayÃºn with a sublime cross. Diego Reyes has been fantastic in dead ball situations this season in Spain. 1-0 *and* you've got Vela now. Gomez also credited Osorio with making better adjustments against Trinidad and Tobago: Eric Gomez @EricGomez86 Against ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·, Osorio's HT shift amounted to taking the pedal off the gas. Tonight, his team looks sharper and more focused. Not a bad look. 3/29/2017, 12:23:49 AM The Mexicans largely controlled the game from there, controlling the pace of play and limiting their opponent's opportunities. Up next for Mexico in World Cup qualifying is a matchup against Honduras on June 7, while Trinidad and Tobago next faces the United States on that same day.
