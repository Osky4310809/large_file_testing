Chelsea are a great team and must play always to win,\" Conte told reporters after the win. \"When we play this type of team, you must have, you must build and you must work on this aspect and the mentality to grow. \n\"I think that today we showed, from the start until the end, the will to win the game. Not to come here only for one point. To try to manage the game. We try to play the game to win. In the end I think we deserved to win.\" \nConte has been reluctant to get sucked into talk of a league and cup double as Chelsea remain in the FA Cup semi-final as they lead the league title race with a strong lead. \nBut he admitted that his side's journey has been \"incredible\" and seemed a little taken aback by how quickly his new team have taken to his ideas this season. \n\"It is incredible, our path,\" he added. \"It is incredible what we are doing. For sure, if we think in the first part of the season, when we started this league. For sure, we put Chelsea with the teams to fight for the title. \n\"At the start of the season, it wasn’t bad after three wins, then we changed a lot. Now we stayed on top of the table, we are deserving to stay there. I have to tell thanks to my players because they are working a lot. Working hard. \n\"They trust our football, in our idea. They show in every game a great commitment. Great will to fight. Great will to show we can win the league.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T09:54:31.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
