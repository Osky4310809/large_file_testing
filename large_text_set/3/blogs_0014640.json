Whether it's meditation, yoga, saying affirmations, or just believing in the law of attraction, spirituality is not as taboo as it once was. But when it comes to your finances, can we use these same principles to help us manage money better? I say yes! The following are five spiritual practices that can help you with your finances.\n1. Make Peace With Your Money Deepak Chopra says in his book The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success , \"Every time you are tempted to react in the same old way, ask yourself if you want to be a prisoner of the past or a pioneer of the future.\" This is important to apply to your money because your upbringing can affect how you deal with your finances. Do you have a scarcity mentality that is making you a money hoarder or has your money history made you a shopaholic? Whatever your money personality is, you must make peace with it and let go of any habits that are not contributing to your journey towards financial freedom . Take a moment to write down the money messages that you've heard coming up, reflect on what you've done right so far with your money, and identify the places where you have opportunities to improve. No matter the mistakes you have made, make peace with them. Forgive yourself for what was, accept what is, and begin to move in the right direction today. Letting go of the past is the best first step to creating a brighter financial future, and brighter future in general.\n2. Visualize Your Abundance The law of attraction teaches us that if we want to reach our goals, then visualization is where we should begin. By visualizing your dreams, you teach your brain to tap into the inner resources that you need to make them a reality. It allows you to see your dreams in your mind's eye in order to accept and believe that you deserve them, and it allows you to stay positive, which will help you to stay on track to be successful in the long run. Visualizing your abundance can help you with your finances in the same way. When you can see yourself with enough money to comfortably reach all of your obligations, then it allows your brain to tap into your inner resources to make that real. When you can see your money goals achieved in your mind's eye, you can begin to feel the way you would when they actually come to fruition, which will help you attract those outcomes faster. Also, visualizing your abundance will keep you in a positive space with your money, which will eventually attract more money to you.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1878424114", "https://bmpowered.bankmobile.com/livefree-life-steps-financial-freedom/", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/nBBfyd3J8ka4QPvCPU3SySTJBn0/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/01/10/845/n/42301552/cd3f56fb166a2fcf_PS16_0402_Lifestyle_16_088.jpg"], "published": "2017-03-16T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:20:33.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
