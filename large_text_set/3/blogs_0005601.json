Talking a bit about the album-making process, she revealed that recording for the song “ Fine ,” in particular, was taxing: “While recording ‘Fine,’ I went to get an IV. Rather than being sick, I felt I needed to recharge.” Taeyeon continued, “I think it was a reflection of the pressure [we were] feeling. I forced my driver and songwriter to take an hour break, and I resumed recording after ‘recharging,'” saying that singing was much easier afterward. When asked which song from the album is her favorite, she said, “How could I choose? I just ask people I know. Fans tell me that a title song is a title song [for a reason]. I think ‘Fine’ is great for any occasion or mood.” Regarding a possible solo concert, Taeyeon said, “I think I’d have to [hold a concert], no?” Source (1)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T16:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T12:00:27.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
