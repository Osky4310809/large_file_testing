He’s confused about what he wants,” Condon said. \nCondon also teased a “nice, exclusively gay moment” at the end of the movie. \n“When companies continually force their views on us we need to take a stand,” the post said. “If we can not take our 11 year old grand daughter and 8 year old grandson to see a movie we have no business watching it. If I can’t sit through a movie with God or Jesus sitting by me then we have no business showing it.” \nThe live-action version of “Beauty and the Beast” is scheduled to debut in theaters on March 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T03:37:23.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
