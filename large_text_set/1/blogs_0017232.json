Class started 30 mins ago. No students yet. I thought one was coming but it was just an administrator. Who laughed at me.\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nFive more minutes have passed. I'm starting to doubt myself. Did I tell them no class? Is today Thursday? Am I dreaming? #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nIt's so quiet. Every time I hear a door open, I sit up and smile. But when nobody enters my classroom, I die on the inside. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nClass started 45 mins ago. Still no students. I get paranoid. Is the door to the classroom locked?\nI check it.\nNo. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nIs everyone else in the world dead? Was there a sudden zombie attack and I survived, alone in my classroom? #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nA bird lands outside my window. I invite him in to learn about algebra. He declines and flies away. I hope a cat eats him. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nI picture Rube Goldberg scenarios where all my students got into in one complex car accident and that's why they're late. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nHe gets existential:\nI check my email to see if I missed something. I have no emails at all. This is weird. Did I die? Am I dead? Is this hell? #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nMy sign-in sheet is as empty as my soul right now. I have to eat this candy alone. #Classwatch2017 pic.twitter.com/loUV8pX5Q5\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nHe was going to give them candy! Those monsters.\nMaybe I should just start lecturing. Students will hear talking and come in. That woudn't be crazy, right? RIGHT?! #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nI SWEAR TO GOD IF SOMEONE IS PULLING A PRANK ON ME I WILL probably break down and cry. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nThe lights just went off on me automatically. I start to get up to move around so they turn on again, but what's the point. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nI hear voices outside. I go to the window, hope in my heart. It's just some kids on their bikes, having fun. 1/2 #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\n\"Why aren't you in school? Your teacher needs you!\" I yell through the closed window and give them the finger. 2/2 #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nHe gets desperate:\nI have started to name the chairs in the classroom. Funfetti is the good student. Charmander, the troublemaker. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nI fire off an email to my boss. \"WHERE ARE ALL THE STUDENTS???!!?? ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª\"\nNo reply. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nThere's hope...\nThen it happens. I hear a door clang open. Footsteps get louder as someone approaches. Could it be? A student? 90 mins late? #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\n... and then it's gone.\nIt's not. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nThat's it. I give up. I'm packing up and going home. Clearly this is a sign that I wasn't meant to teach anyone today. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nTwo students just walked in. Remorseless, no apology, no explanation. I hope they don't think they're getting any candy. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nI can't do it. I give them candy anyway, but remind them that class started 95 minutes ago. They shrug. Urge to kill rises. #Classwatch2017\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nBoth students ask to use the computer today. I sigh and say okay. I don't even need to be here. End. #Classwatch2017 pic.twitter.com/FKEaTDaxuU\nâ€” Adam Heath Avitable (@avitable) January 19, 2017\nWhat a rollercoaster ride of emotion.\nAccording to his Twitter page, he is also a stand-up comedian.
