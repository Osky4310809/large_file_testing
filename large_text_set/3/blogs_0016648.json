He tries to be discreet, calm; find the way to disconnect,” he told France Football , in an interview to be published in full on Tuesday. Middlesbrough 1 Manchester United 3 player ratings Middlesbrough 1 Manchester United 3 player ratings 1/22 Victor Valdes – 5 out of 10 \nHis double save was a moment of excellence, but he was beaten twice by Fellaini and Lingard and conceded a calamitous third. AFP/Getty Images 2/22 Antonio Barragan – 5 out of 10 \nHeld his shape well at the back, but was beaten by the occasional over the top ball. Getty Images 3/22 Bernardo Espinosa – 3 out of 10 \nReally struggled against the pace of Rashford and the other United forwards. An afternoon to forget. AFP/Getty Images 4/22 Ben Gibson – 5 out of 10 \nTried in vain to start attacks by hitting long-passes forward but had a difficult afternoon. Getty Images 5/22 Fabio – 6 out of 10 \nLooked assured in possession and did well going forwards; one of Middlesbrough's better players. Getty Images 6/22 Marten De Roon – 5 out of 10 \nHe worked relentlessly, but ultimately failed to make an impact on the game. He was outplayed in the midfield. AFP/Getty Images 7/22 Adam Clayton – 4 out of 10 \nHe looked lost at times – drifting in and out the game. Lost possession quickly and failed to read the game. Man Utd via Getty Images 8/22 Grant Leadbitter – 6 out of 10 \nWas a key element to almost every Boro move – making clever and quick decisions in possession. Getty Images 9/22 Stewart Downing – 5 out of 10 \nWasteful in possession and failed to make an impact going forward. Getty Images 10/22 Alvaro Negredo – 5 out of 10 \nWas Middlesbrough's principal target man but he was always surrounded by a sea of United shirts. Getty Images 11/22 Gaston Ramirez – 6 out of 10 \nCaused a nuisance of himself, but was guilty of dropping too deep at times. Getty Images 12/22 David De Gea – 5 out of 10 \nHad very little to do. Unfortunate with Middlesbrough's goal. Getty Images 13/22 Eric Bailly – 5 out of 10 \nRamirez was getting the better of him at times due to his slack man-marking. Getty Images 14/22 Chris Smalling – 6 out of 10 \nIntercepted a handful of important crosses and led the United defence well. Could have done better to clear the ball for Gestede’s goal. Getty Images 15/22 Phil Jones – 5 out of 10 \nHeld his own at the back, but made a number of unnecessary fouls. Getty Images 16/22 Ashley Young – 6 out of 10 \nHis assist for the opening goal was an example of his ability, although he drifted out of the game late on. Man Utd via Getty Images 17/22 Michael Carrick – 6 out of 10 \nA textbook Carrick display. He created chances, defended well and his work rate was relentless. AFP/Getty Images 18/22 Marouane Fellaini – 7 out of 10 \nOpened the scoring for United with a header. Tough tackling and used possession well throughout. Getty Images 19/22 Antonio Valencia - 5 out of 10 \nDefended well, but looked even better going forward to support the strikers. Getty Images 20/22 Juan Mata – 7 out of 10 \nLooked dangerous going forward and classy on the ball. Getty Images 21/22 Jesse Lingard – 7 out of 10 \nHis goal was an example of his individual ability – fully deserved. He linked well with Rashford throughout. Getty Images 22/22 Marcus Rashford – 6 out of 10 \nShould have scored, especially in the first half. Worked well, but needs to be more clinical. AFP/Getty Images \n“I can go home and not watch a football game, not think football. I can do it. At the beginning of my career, I could not. I was constantly connected, 24 hours a day. \n“I had to find a form of maturity. Today, I feel good with my personality as a man. I have matured, I am more peaceful. A victory no longer represents the moon and a defeat hell. \n“I believe that I am able to transmit this serenity to those who work with me, to my players. I have the same ambitions as before. \n“The same involvement, the same professionalism, but I'm more in control of my emotions,” he added. \nIn an excerpt of the same interview, Mourinho discusses his decision to join United and suggests that it is more challenging to manage in the Premier League than other elite European leagues. \nIn what could be construed as a jibe at Guardiola, he chose the Manchester City manager’s former club, Bayern Munich, as an example of team who can easily dominate their domestic division. \n“In England, clubs are so economically powerful that the market is open to all,” he said. “Take the example of Bayern in Germany. You know when they start winning the title every year? The summer before, they buy the best player of Borussia Dortmund. Götze, then Lewandowski the following year, then Hummels last year. Ferguson to return to United dugout - for one-off game \n“Me, I arrive at a club that has a great and prestigious history, but that can no longer be declined in the same way,” Mourinho added. \n“No club in England, whether it's Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City can no longer be dominant permanently. Power has divided.” \n\nMourinho appeared to make a similar dig at Guardiola while celebrating his third Premier League title win with Chelsea in May 2015. \n“For me, I'm not the smartest guy to choose countries and clubs. I could choose another club in another country where to be champion is easier,” he said after a 1-0 win against Crystal Palace. \n“Maybe in the future I have to be smarter and choose another club in another country where everybody is champion. Maybe I will go to a country where a kitman can be coach and win the title.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:35:31.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
