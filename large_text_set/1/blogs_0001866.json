The Pelicans cut Reggie Williams on Sunday to clear a roster spot.\nIf and when Motiejunas comes to terms with the Pelicans, it’ll end a months-long holdout by the 26-year-old Lithuanian. Motiejunas played his last four seasons with the Houston Rockets , but the two teams were unable to resolve a lingering contract dispute this summer. Because Motiejunas was a restricted free agent, he had little leverage in the situation.\nMotiejunas was originally traded to the Pistons last February, but the team nixed the deal after his physical revealed concerns with a back injury. At the start of December, still unsigned, Motiejunas signed a deal with the Brooklyn Nets . When the Rockets chose to match, he refused to report to the team, and Houston eventually rescinded his restricted free agency status so he could sign unhindered.\nThis is a no-brainer for the Pelicans, who have nothing to lose by hanging out a one-year contract at the minimum to someone who has been a solid NBA player throughout his career so far. He’ll be able to play with Anthony Davis or help bolster the team’s offense when the superstar big man isn’t on the floor.\nMotiejunas only played 37 games last season because of injury, but he averaged 12 points and 5.9 rebounds in 71 games the year prior.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T02:02:58.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
