Tony Mostrom Print Article Students of 20th century art know the name Beatrice Wood. She was, first, the young, American girlfriend of the French-born Dadaist painter Marcel Duchamp. With Duchamp’s encouragement she painted, then became known much later as a maker of ceramics and pottery. When she was very young Beatrice managed to finagle her unsympathetic, businessman father into bankrolling some Dadaist art projects, including some one-off Dada magazines, New York Dada and Rongwrong , copies of which now “fetch,” as they say, huge prices on the art market. \nI had known since my art-book-devouring days that Wood, in her middle age, had moved out to California around 1947, no doubt leaving some romantic heartache behind. I also knew she eventually set herself up in a ceramics studio in the Ojai valley, an hour or so northwest of L.A. and \"found her bliss\" there, with the help of a then-famous, Indian-born sage named Jiddu Krishnamurti. \nWood had left the ice-cold East (and Duchamp) to come out to serene, warm Southern California or as Teddy Roosevelt once called it, “west of the west.” (I mention Roosevelt here also because he once described Duchamp’s famous painting Nude Descending a Staircase as “barely half as interesting as a Navajo rug,” or words to that effect.) \nOjai is known as a place where a lot of celebrities (and not only the usual Hollywood kind) have found a degree of cozy, rustic isolation and seclusion that’s close enough to feel connected to L.A. by non-romantic freeway, while keeping overly comfortable in a beauteous valley (with great Italian restaurants) that looks like a slice of Montana or maybe the western Sierras. It’s rustic and artsy and wealthy and always has been. So deal with it! \nThe drive from L.A. to Ojai, by the aforementioned non-romantic 101, takes you past some nice, calming, pastoral landscapes of rolling hills, at least after you’ve passed Calabasas (where there are streets named after my relative, pioneer local landowner Charles Mureau; just thought I’d mention that). By the time you’ve passed a neon overpass sign welcoming you to the town of Ventura (originally \"San Buenaventura\"), the road suddenly curves right and heads north, eventually taking you deep into a valley of low-lying hills that you never realized was there (‘cuz your mind was on Santa Barbara or Santa Cruz or San Francisco). \nI have nothing to say about the art galleries that you’ll see lining the main commercial drag as you glide into downtown Ojai, with its long row of Spanish Mission-like columns; that’s a matter of taste. But Beatrice Wood’s historic presence in this little ritzy-rustic town was and is a landmark. Her studio home, located far up a mountain road on the bucolic and orange-grovey outskirts-of-Ojai (Upper Ojai) is open to the public a few days a week. \nAt age 90, Wood wrote an autobiography called I Shock Myself , which was a cute reference to the old WWI-era Dada tenet of “shocking” the public. How shocking was Wood’s own artwork? Not hugely so, really; she once put a real clamshell over the, uh, “pubis” of her pencil drawing of a naked woman. But that was 1917; we were easily shockable then, I guess. More shock-worthily, her threesome-involvement in that same era with both Duchamp and his friend, diplomat Henri-Pierre Roche, allegedly was the inspiration for Jules and Jim , the classic Truffaut film. \nWait a minute, what’s that over there, a few blocks up toward the hills? A bookshop that looks like an open-air patio? With all the books potentially open to the elements, i.e. rain? Weird. It’s got must-see all written over it … Related Stories 1960s Canyon Culture Has Been Preserved in Amber in a Little Foothills Spot \nI pulled over and walked out into the \"frosty\" 46-degree late-afternoon air, and sauntered over to the central, concrete “plaza” of Bart’s Books , which it turns out has been there since 1964. (“This may be the only outdoor bookstore in the United States,” says a guidebook. Uh-huh.) Ah, now I see: the unwanted cheapies, the dull and forgotten, are kept out in the open-air shelves getting all sun-bleached and depressing, while the good stuff is kept safe from harm inside discrete little bungalows. \nMatt, a very tall burly young man, offers me a guided tour when I mention that this trip is for the Weekly . Bart’s is apparently more than a novelty, the place is also quite a collector-savvy bookshop. He points out some nice first editions of early Hunter Thompson, Allen Ginsberg, a vintage Henry Miller pamphlet kept inside a glass case in the colorful and rarified art books room. We talk about other literary outlaws, like John Gilmore and William Burroughs. “Oh, that book he [Burroughs] did with Brion Gyson, The Third Mind ? That’s my favorite book,” he says. “In my entire private collection.” OK, countercultural hipness in Ojai! It figures, I guess. I ask him if he’s been to Beatrice Wood’s Studio … well, of course he has. Dumb question, probably. \nHe tells me Bart’s is famous for utilizing the honor system when they’re closed, in that you can pay for the books you want (from the outside wall shelves) by “throwing coins” through the door. So simple! And people actually do it. Hideous views! Tony Mostrom \nSo what is Ojai about, you might ask. While most places are never “about” anything, Ojai actually used to be “about” something. To make a long story short: in those restless early decades of the 20th century, utopian and spiritually inclined colonies settled here, communal utopias that tend to eventually break up. However, the world-famous Theosophical Society still has a presence in Ojai. One of their original “colonists” here, Alfred P. Warrington, considered this valley to be “impregnated with occult and psychic influences.\" From what I know, these are the roots of “retreat culture” in America. \nOjai was originally christened “Nordhoff” back in the 1870s, in honor of an American author named Charles Nordhoff, who wrote a book called Communistic Societies in America (in the 1870s mind you, not the 1950s; big difference). Later during WWI, when all Americans were expected to suddenly hate anything even vaguely German, the name was changed to Ojai, after the original (and aboriginal) Chumash word for ‘moon.’ Seemed harmless.
