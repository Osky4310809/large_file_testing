A burger is more expensive than buying vegetables, according to the report \nT he IEA said the £1 cost of a cheeseburger could also buy a kilo of sweet potatoes, two kilos of carrots, two and a half kilos of pasta, 10 apples or seven bananas, claiming that the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day could cost as little as 30p. \nIt concluded that \"ultimately price is not the main driver of unhealthy food consumption\", suggesting that consumers were often prepared to pay more for taste and convenience. \nThe IEA said the \"popular belief\" that obesity and poor nutrition is directly driven by economic deprivation was \"untenable\", adding that the use of taxes and subsidies to incentivise better nutrition was unlikely to be successful.

People are prepared to pay a premium for taste and convenience. \n\"A nutritious diet that meets government recommendations is more affordable than ever. \n\"Given the relatively high cost of junk food, it is unlikely that taxing unhealthy food or subsidising healthy food would change people's eating habits. Instead, it would transfer wealth from the poor to the rich.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T08:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:19:45.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
