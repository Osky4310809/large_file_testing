The Dada DooDoo squad, for example, trotted out a working \"chicken cannon\" and, in honor of Donald Trump, a literal toilet of burning shit. For their efforts the squad took home Best In Show in the trophy-giving part of the day's festivities. \nThe San Fermidiots, an international coterie of actual research scientists, whose covered their cart with a papier-mĂ˘chĂŠ bull which, among other tricks, peed alcohol and pooped brownie bites. These relentlessly enthusiastic brainiacs won Best Industrial Design for their efforts. \nAlso impressive was the Affordable Candy Act crew, who waved signs and chanted things like \"I'm With Her-shey\" and \"Yes We Candy!\"; \"The Price Is Wrong, Bitch\" cart, complete with working spinning wheel; the Medieval Times team, whose banquet table overflowed with goblets of mead and platters of carrion; and the End of the Earth Gala, manned by armed polar bears forming the last line of resistance against climate disaster. \nAnd after all that work, the carts were destroyed by a greedy-Trump-pig crusher at the Gowanus Ballroom, a fitting end to raucous day.
