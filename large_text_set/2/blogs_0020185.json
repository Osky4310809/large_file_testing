Spicer said : \nThe president has maintained for a long time that this is a states’ rights issue and not one for the federal government. So while there will be further guidance coming out, I think that all you have to do is look at what the president’s view has been for a long time: that this is not something the federal government should be involved in. This is a states’ rights issue. \nCommenting on the new policy changes, Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said: \nThis is the first day of the president’s second month in office and he is now fully coming after LGBT people. I’m angry; I’m outraged. This is about kids who just want to go to school who just want to be themselves, and to hear the president a week or two ago talk about how supportive he is of LGBT people, it’s just outrageous that he go after trans kids this way. \nAlso commenting on the policy changes, HRC President Chad Griffin said: \nTransgender young people face tragically high rates of discrimination and bullying, and they need a government that will stand up for them — not attack them. It’s shocking that this kind of harm would even be a subject of debate for the president. We call on Trump to immediately and permanently affirm the Obama Administration’s guidance and protect transgender students. \nLast year, in a victory for human rights , the Obama administration issued a sweeping directive telling every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity. \nIn a letter sent to every public school district in America the Obama administration warned school districts that they should allow transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their chosen gender identity, or risk losing federal funding. \nHowever, in reaction to the fair and just policy move, conservative Christians reacted with horror , angry that their privilege had been exposed, and their prejudice and bigotry was being challenged. \nIn reality, it is Republican lawmakers, and not transgender people, who are the real danger in public bathrooms. In fact, more GOP Lawmakers have been arrested for sexual misconduct in bathrooms than transgender people. \nBottom line: The Trump Administration has declared war on transgender students, and the federal government under Trump will do nothing to protect the civil rights of transgender individuals.
