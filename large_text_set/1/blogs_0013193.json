And in the copyright information? You guessed it: Craze Productions. We reached out to Craze for comment, but they have not responded. Our guess is that this is a cash grab by Craze, a company that has a well-documented history of not paying attention to little things like copyright laws . Some fans were ecstatic at the compilation finally being available, though many were aware of the back story and were counting the minutes until the album disappeared from the internet again. \nI already have all her albums including this Ultimate box set but finally!!!! Aaliyah's real music is finally on iTunes ❤️ pic.twitter.com/7ZgyzQmRiA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T10:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T06:38:12.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
