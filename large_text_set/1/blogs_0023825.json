Comment IMAGE Harry Potter/Warner Bros. After you've read a Harry Potter book or watched one of the 1,000 movies in the franchise, it's normal to wish you lived in a world filled with magical creatures. You know, ones that can teleport , guard treasures , or even suck out your soul (resisting the urge to make a political joke here!!!). Unfortunately, the planet is still void of any IRL magical beings, but wizards everywhere will be excited to hear that there has been a recent Harry Potter -related scientific discovery. According to LiveScience , there is officially a new species of crab, and it's name is — drum roll please — Harryplax severus . YEP. This lil crab is blessed enough to be named after two beloved Harry Potter characters: Harry himself and Severus Snape. More from Cosmo.ph A 'Harry Potter' Cafe In Singapore Serves Actual Goblets Of Fire The 0.3 by 0.2 inch crab was discovered by researcher and ex-Marine, Harry T. Conley, in Guam in 1998. However, researchers didn't identify it as a new genus and species until recently. (The name is also a nod to Conley, who has since passed away.) Peter Ng and Jose Mendoza, biologists at the National University of Singapore and co-authors of the study on Harryplax severus , wrote that they named the species after Conley because his work has \"substantially advanced the cause of marine science.\" But why the Harry Potter reference?! Ng and Mendoza wrote that while Harry Potter was a magical hero, Conley had an \"uncanny ability to collect rare and interesting creatures as if by magic.\" And just as Professor Severus Snape had kept one of the most important secrets in the story, this new species had \"eluded discovery until now, nearly 20 years after it was first collected.\" It's hard to be, wait for it, CRABBY about that. Ok bye now, sorry, I'm leaving, ugh where is my Floo powder... \n***This article originally appeared on Cosmopolitan.com . Minor edits have been made by the Cosmo.ph editors.
