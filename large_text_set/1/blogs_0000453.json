Nice!\" Mr Trump tweeted . Image copyright Twitter \nIn a televised New Year message on Sunday , Mr Kim Jong-un said North Korea was close to testing long-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. \nHe said the country was now a \"military power of the East that cannot be touched by even the strongest enemy\". \nNorth Korea has conducted two nuclear tests over the last year, raising fears that it has made significant nuclear advances. But it has never successfully test-fired long-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. \nExperts estimate it might take less than five years. UN resolutions call for an end to the country's nuclear and missile tests. Analysis - by Steve Evans, BBC News, Seoul \nThere are no ifs or buts in Mr Trump's tweet - simply the words: \"It won't happen\". \nThey may mean that Mr Trump believes North Korea will fail to make the technological progress, or that the regime will collapse, or that he could persuade Kim Jong-un to renounce his nuclear programme - he said before the election that the two leaders might sit down over a burger. \nOr it could be that Mr Trump is considering military action. If so, experts believe the options are limited. \nOne told the BBC that neither \"bunker-busting\" bombs nor a special forces operation would be certain to destroy the programme. \nThe most likely counter-measures would be infecting computers with disruptive viruses, and perhaps the assassination of key scientists, something difficult to do for many reasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:54:35.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
