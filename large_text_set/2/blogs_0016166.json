More than 70% believe Coalition not doing enough on energy – poll Read more \nAnd watching the speed of the public roll-out of the proposals to re-visit so-called “clean coal” technology and fund new coalmines with public funding earmarked for clean energy, the whole process smacks of a coordinated industry-government campaign: create energy security crisis ignoring advice that renewables were not to blame for outages, position coal as the only short–term salvatio, oh, and don’t say anything about the weather. \nBut in a caution to the Coal Club and their Canberra operatives, this week’s Essential Report warns the latest shots in the climate wars are being fired not from a position of political strength, but from one of weakness: Do you believe that there is fairly conclusive evidence that climate change is happening? \nThese figures are the strongest public endorsement of climate science since we starting tracking the question in 2009, before the climate consensus was broken by Toy Abbott’s power price assault. \nAt the time, Abbott’s “Big New Tax” seemed as heavy-handed as Morrison’s lump of coal; but, fuelled by industry-funded sceptics and conveniently rising prices caused by the gold-plating of an energy network being fattened for sale, he was able to pioneer fake news and reframe the debate. \nThe energy price frame claimed the then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull and not one, but two, Labor prime ministers before delivering Abbott office with a mandate to wind back carbon pricing. \nDespite Abbott’s best effort, the Coal Club didn’t succeed in killing off the Commonwealth Renewable Energy Target and the accoutrements of the carbon price, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Change Authority. \nAs the pricing panic subsided (and note the carbon price compensation payments are still flowing through to many households), the reality of climate change and the need for action had somewhat of a renaissance, fuelled perhaps by a string of record temperatures. \nLabor rediscovered its stomach for climate action by endorsing an extended renewable target, technology pushed the costs of solar and wind energy down and the development of battery technology loomed as a game-changer. \nThe position Labor took to the 2016 election maintains broad public support today, not just from its base and the greens, but from than half of all Coalition voters: The Labor Party has committed to a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030. Do you approve or disapprove of this policy? \nMeanwhile, Turnbull having lost political skin for being seen to walk away from his personal commitment to climate action is presiding over a team that is now not seen to be doing enough to deliver affordable or sustainable energy. Do you think the Federal Government is doing enough, not enough or too much to ensure affordable, reliable and clean energy for Australian households and businesses? \nSo what is Turnbull’s game in amping up the anti-renewables rhetoric and professing his newfound love for coal? \nFirst, he knows that people are sick of constant change and complexity in the energy industry, are anxious about it, and are very susceptible to becoming more anxious. \nSecond, he knows that energy transition is irrepressible – you can’t stop technological development, the evolution of consumer expectations or the imperative of policy at least giving a nod to climate reality. \nThird, he understands that this irrepressible energy transition will inevitably cause more political pain – things are going to get more complex, and more expensive no matter what we build. \nThere are also serious risks of energy have-nots being severely hurt because energy distributors and retailers struggle to make money from solar customers and therefore will charge non-solar customers more. \nSo the prime minister has a simple choice: share minimised pain or inflict maximised pain. \nHaving tried the former when nutting out the carbon compromise with Kevin Rudd, which cost both them their jobs, he’s ready to have a crack at the more hairy-chested approach. \nFirst, it shifts the pressure back to Shorten at a time when he has been coasting in the polls. \nSecond, it plays superbly to his conservative internal audience who still wear their climate change scepticism as some weird form of Ayn Rand-inspired rugged individualism. \nBut most importantly, it sets up huge disparity in political blame stemming from energy anxiety. \nThe coal industry’s game is even more ambitious – not only to slow the transition to renewables, but to stop South Australia being seen to be successful in their embrace of the technology – because that destroys the Coal Club’s value more than any short-term price on carbon. Hard facts unmask the fiction behind Coalition's 'coal comeback' | Lenore Taylor Read more \nThey know that the future is increasingly non-coal but wants to ensure that as many coal-fired generators as possible are built around the world in the next decade, which hardwires their product into the global energy system for a longer period. \nTheir objectives include creating a consensus that South Australia is a basket case and embarrassment, forcing policy reversal or a policy millstone on ALP states, and ending the preferential funding for renewables at a national level. \nBut there’s one significant problem. People like renewables. They love the sense of independence their rooftop solar gives them. \nAnd they know that the future will be clean and smart not dirty and dumb. A full two thirds of people see renewables as a solution rather than a threat, which must include a good number of those who yearn for a less complex and confusing utility supply model. Do you think renewable energy is the solution to our future energy needs or is renewable energy a threat to our future energy supply? \nAnd herein lies the risk for the Turnbull government. The vast majority of the public – including Coalition voters – are not buying the campaign that renewables are to blame for the national market’s troubles. \nThere might well be real challenges associated with maintaining systems security as it becomes increasingly based on wind and solar but the majority of people remain more interested in solving those challenges than in scoring political points off them. \nThat’s why opportunistically linking renewables to any power disruption, no matter how tenuous the connection, is not going to stop anytime soon. \nThe Coal Club has grasped carbon inertia from the jaws of action once before - even in the face of the science and the economics. It’s betting that history will repeat itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:46:16.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
