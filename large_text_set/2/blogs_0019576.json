The Honda Classic: Articles, photos and videos \n“You know, that's something that sounds so dumb when you say it, but when you're playing against somebody, and they're slumping their shoulders, and they look exhausted, you're like, `Hey, I can beat this guy.’ I'm trying to work to get to that and be a little bit more even keel and less emotional.” \nThomas, who won twice in Hawaii at year’s start, is playing a home game this week. He lives in Jupiter, a 20-minute drive from PGA National. He was asked if he’ll bring more confidence to the Champion Course having a pair of victories under his belt this season. \n“Not really, just because I had the confidence I could do it in the past,” Thomas said. “Just didn’t really have the resume to go with it. But now I guess maybe I could have a little bit more swag when I’m walking out there.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:33:01.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
