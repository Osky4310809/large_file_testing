She also voiced her support for Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Crabtree added that O’Grady posted the inflammatory remarks in October, but has since deleted her pre-election posts after complaints were filed. Crabtree also interviewed O’ Grady, where she said that her strong reactions were due to the fact that she was sexually assaulted in college. Yet, she said that her anti-Trump feelings wouldn’t impact how she executes her job: Kerry O'Grady, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Denver district, oversees coordination with Washington-based advance teams for all presidential candidate and presidential trips to the area, including all upcoming or future trips by the president, vice president or Trump administration officials.\n[…] \nIn one Facebook post O'Grady wrote at 11:07 p.m. on a Sunday in October, she endorsed Hillary Clinton and said she would endure \"jail time\" rather than \"taking a bullet\" for what she regarded as a \"disaster\" for America. \n[…] \nIn the same post, she mentioned the Hatch Act, which bars executive branch staff, except the president, vice president and some other senior executive officials, from engaging in certain political activities. \nAs a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median,\" she wrote. \"To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. \n\"But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her.\" \n[…] \nIn a lengthy interview with the Washington Examiner Monday, O'Grady said she took down the post after two to three days of greater reflection and wasn't trying to imply she wouldn't take a bullet for Trump or any officials in the Trump administration. \n\"It was an internal struggle for me but as soon as I put it up, I thought it was not the sentiment that I needed to share because I care very deeply about the mission,\" she said. \nO'Grady repeatedly stressed that she would in no way shirk her duties to protect the president because of her opposition to Trump's candidacy and support for Clinton. \n\"No, not at all. I firmly believe in this job. I'm proud to do it and we serve the office of the president,\" she said. \nO’Grady went back at it again during the Women’s March over the inauguration weekend, posting “all of these women represent me! Proud to say it! #nasty.” Crabtree added that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service is aware of the postings, and that the department’s inspector general is reportedly looking into it. Yet, she added that it’s unknown if the Secret Service bars employees from engaging in political speech on social media platforms. O’Grady then offered the following statement to Crabtree: I serve this country with pride and I proudly diligently and fiercely protect and support the institutions and pillars of our republic established by the very same document that allows my free expression. I do so with every fiber of my being for the very reason that those institutions are in place to guarantee my right and the rights of all our citizens to voice and express our opinions and beliefs even when and especially when those values may be contrary to those of the party in power. My devotion to mission and country is only strengthened by the fact that the founders recognize the value of dissent and the freedom to assemble and voice those opposing convictions. \nWhen asked again if her anti-Trump feelings would affect her executing her duties, she said, “I hope you understand that's an emphatic no and I need to make sure that's resoundingly clear and just reinforces that this job needs to done well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T08:05:25.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
