And like other reviews mentioned, you still can’t put connections in folders.Also, integration with Windows 10 DPI settings is non-existent. Windows 10 leaves the DPI choice up to the connecting client settings, which only seems to work from a windows 10 client. So of course, from the Mac they leave it as default, with no ability to change it. The result is a super tiny user experience if using higher resolutions. The only workaround is to use lower resolutions, which makes things look crappy, or keep using windows 7 for your hosts. Don’t like the new permissions dialog by KangarooBox I’m constantly attaching to new and different Windows instances in AWS and the new security dialog box prompts me every single time. Since these instances are always different there is no way to turn off this prompt and it (along with self-signed cert prompt) means I have to click OK several times in order to connect.
