Photo: Apple \nThinking about picking up the new PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus? Get yours from Target between March 26 and April 1 and you’ll bag a free gift card worth $300. \nYou could use it to buy an Apple Watch Series 1, which the retailer will soon be offering for just $199.99 — $70 off its regular retail price. The promotion is scheduled to start on March 26. Photo: PhoneArena \nThe iPhone 7 series has been selling well since it made its big debut last September, but six months on, with a major refresh making headlines every week , retailers will be keen to shift as many units as possible before the inevitable decline in demand. \nTarget is already gearing up to launch a big iPhone 7 promotion, according to a leaked newspaper ad obtained by PhoneArena. The retail will be giving away a $300 gift card to anyone who purchases an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus between March 26 and April 1. \nYou won’t be able to buy the phone unlocked; you’ll need to pay for it monthly with a new plan on AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon to be eligible. And of course, the $300 credit can only be spent in Target stores. But there’s one thing you might want to use it for. The same ad reveals that Target will be reducing the Apple Watch Series 1 to $199.99, which is $70 off its regular price.\nIt’s not a great time to purchase an iPhone 7, unless you desperately want the new PRODUCT(RED) model, what with the 10th anniversary iPhone arriving in six months. But if you’re getting one anyway, this seems like a great deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:09:15.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
