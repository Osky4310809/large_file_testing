Duryea, of the U.S Christian Commission who met frequently with President Lincoln described him as follows: \nIn temper he was earnest, yet controlled, frank, yet sufficiently guarded, patient, yet energetic, forgiving, yet just to himself; generous yet firm.

His whole nature was simple and sincere- he was pure, and then was himself. \nNow, apart from being remembered for his vital role as the leader in preserving the union during the civil war and contributing greatly towards ending slavery in the United States, his name is forever engraved in the hearts and minds of leaders. \nLincoln’s leadership qualities are studied by presidents, CEO’s, students and anyone looking to become a strong, good leader. So, to honor and celebrate all of his accomplishments, we have pulled together four courses that will you help become a better leader and exemplify some of Lincoln’s essential leadership qualities. 1.
