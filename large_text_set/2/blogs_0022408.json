JUST WATCHED Authorities describe Kim Jong Nam's death as a brutal political killing 03:14 Story highlights Everard: Pyongyang's use of a chemical weapon will open up a whole new confrontation with the international community Plus, it strains badly relations with North Korea's few remaining friends, Everard says John Everard is a former British ambassador to North Korea.

VX is very difficult to obtain -- but North Korea is known to manufacture it , according to organization Nuclear Threat Initiative. This was a horrible thing to do -- and also very stupid. It was stupid because, just as it seemed that nothing could make North Korea's international position any worse, Pyongyang may have found an action that did exactly that. The use of a chemical weapon will open up a whole new confrontation between North Korea and the international community, to add to the constant battles already over its nuclear and missile programs and its appalling human rights record.
