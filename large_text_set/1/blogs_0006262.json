Street magician David Blaine accidentally shot himself in the throat recently, when he was really just trying to shoot himself in the mouth. \nLet us explain. Blaine closed his Las Vegas show “Beyond Magic” recently with a classic bullet-catching trick, in which a lone rifle shot was supposed to be nabbed by a metal cup in his mouth. Unfortunately, the cup slipped off the grooves that attached it to a special gum shield, and Blaine nearly blew his head clear off. \nThe self-fired bullet broke through the contraption and lacerated Blaine’s throat. Those with the stomach for these sorts of things can watch the near-disaster via the video above.

At that moment, I realized that the mouth guard had shattered again, and I was alive.” 'Rules Don't Apply' Star Lily Collins Exclusive Portraits (Photos) \nActress Lily Collins, \"Rules Don't Apply\" \nPhotographed by Benjo Arwas for TheWrap \nActress Lily Collins, \"Rules Don't Apply\" \nPhotographed by Benjo Arwas for TheWrap \nActress Lily Collins, \"Rules Don't Apply\" \nPhotographed by Benjo Arwas for TheWrap \nActress Lily Collins, \"Rules Don't Apply\" \nPhotographed by Benjo Arwas for TheWrap \nActress Lily Collins, \"Rules Don't Apply\" \nPhotographed by Benjo Arwas for TheWrap \nActress Lily Collins, \"Rules Don't Apply\" \nPhotographed by Benjo Arwas for TheWrap \nActress Lily Collins, \"Rules Don't Apply\" \nPhotographed by Benjo Arwas for TheWrap Previous Slide", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T01:58:21.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
