Getty 0 Mar 24, 2017 07:45:00 Soccerway's betting guide last racked up a 10/1 five fold and there's a free brand new edition dedicated to the latest international action \nAs we look on at another big week of football ahead, let Soccerway take the research and guesswork out of the equation for you by serving up their best picks ahead. \nWith a spread of important international action coming up, edition 27 of Soccerway’s betting guide covers a key period in which teams will look to continue marching closer to qualification for Russia 2018. \nAll you have to do is register to become a Soccerway member. It's quick, easy and most importantly free and once you're done there's a copy of the latest weekly betting guide waiting for you. Either log in and download a copy of the guide from your profile page or look out for the email notification which will include a link to it. \nEdition 27 contains 18 stat-based selections across a range of competitions, markets and bet types. You can read the guide online or download it to desktop, mobile or tablet so you can stay up to date wherever you are. \nUnlucky to lose against Germany, England will be hoping to consolidate their progress under Gareth Southgate when they host Lithuania at Wembley in their qualifier, and Soccerway’s team has got you covered on that with the Three Lions part of a five fold priced at 8/1 (9.00) . \nHowever, they have not forgotten the other key matches during the period, and you can mark your cards with picks from Portugal’s clash with Hungary and the British encounter between Republic of Ireland and Wales. \nIn the latter match, you have a usual suspect in Gareth Bale as one of the anytime eagles to score, but it won’t be all Cristiano Ronaldo as Portugal turn to a certain Porto starlet to lead them to glory. \nWith the usual selection of Opta stats that have proved a favourite amongst punters, Soccerway has your betting activity this weekend backed up. \nThe guide is available free every week and with four winning accumulators tipped up already this season, there are high hopes for the latest edition.
