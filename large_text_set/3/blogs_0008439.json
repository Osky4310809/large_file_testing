Designed by UAU Collectiv , the new #150 Skilpod solar-powered model is a zero-energy home constructed from cross-laminated timber and takes about 20 days in total to build in the firm’s factory in Geel. The timber modular home can be easily expanded and customized as needed and is insulated to passive standards. \nThe #150 Skilpod model is one of the construction company’s largest single-unit models—the smallest in their range is a mere 30 square meters in size. These modestly sized houses are designed as social housing or group living projects targeted at single parent families, retirees, or first-time renters or buyers. The modular homes can be stacked together to create apartment blocks. All modules are made from cross-laminated timber , a material chosen for its strength, airtightness for high insulation, fire resistance, and carbon sequestration. \nThe 280-square-meter #150 model home completed at 3945 Ham, Belgium was prefabricated in Skilpod’s Geel factory over the course of 20 days and then transported in three pieces to its final site for assembly, which took about half a day. Set atop a concrete foundation, the modules are clad in highly durable FSC-certified Padouk timber and insulated with high-density Rockwool Redair. Following passive design principles, the home is oriented for solar optimization and outfitted with a special type of glass with a solar filter to minimize solar heat gain. \nRelated: Stackable prefab homes in London let you design the interior before moving in \nRooftop solar panels provide all the electricity needed to power the zero-energy home. The prefabricated home’s high insulation values and airtightness means that only a one-kilowatt electric heater would be needed to heat the home. The house also includes a heat-recovery system as well as an air-to-water electrical heat pump that powers the radiant underfloor heating and hot water. \nImages via Skilpod , © Geert Van Hertum View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T16:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T11:41:34.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
