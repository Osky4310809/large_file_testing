King was apparently caught up in this when someone decided to break the glass in the vehicle he rented. Protestors in DC smashed the windows of my hired SUV & many other cars. I was working in-studio & am ok, but my driver is a bit rattled. \n— Larry King (@kingsthings) January 20, 2017 \nReports indicate that over 200 demonstrators have been placed under arrest. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T04:12:13.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
