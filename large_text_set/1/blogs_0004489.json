Read more NHS turning into 'national hangover service', health chief warns \nAt least £57m has been paid out to them since April 2013, according to the 69 per cent of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) using the schemes which gave details of their operating costs. \nDoctors expressed concern that paying third parties to screen GP referrals – around a third of which are run by private companies – was of questionable effectiveness. \n“[CCGs] are leaping at these schemes without any clear evidence of benefit and that they’re just hopeful that it might reduce their costs,” Dr Richard Vautrey told the journal . \nDr Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said some schemes were helpful because they gave GPs rapid access to advice from local specialists. \nBut he called their use a “very, very short term approach to healthcare management”. Jeremy Hunt on NHS mortality rates \n“We need to see much more evaluation… and not just keep making the same mistakes year after year,” he said. “As public bodies, there should be an expectation on every CCG to account for what it’s doing.” \nAround 40 per cent of the CCGs that responded to freedom of information requests from the BMJ said they used a referral management centre of some kind to scrutinise patient referrals to local hospitals. Mistakes by hospital staff that put patients at risk see sharp rise \nOf these, 32 per cent were run by private companies, while 29 per cent were run in house, 22 per cent by local NHS trusts or NHS commissioning support units, 10 per cent by the voluntary sector, and seven per cent by local clinicians. \nA 2011 survey of GPs by Pulse magazine revealed that as many as one in eight patients were being denied referrals made by their family doctors. \nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs , said it was “concerning” to see such little evidence of referral management centres saving money and called for better evaluation of the schemes. \n“Before any decision is taken by a CCG to allocate some of its funding into schemes such as management referral systems – and paying private companies to run them - they need to be properly evaluated and assessed to see if they will be effective, safe and ultimately benefit the care provided to patients,” she said. \n“CCGs also need to ensure that they are supported by the member practices in their decisions. \n“While not all of the CCGs disclosed information about their spending, it’s concerning to see that so few using these schemes have actually reported saving money – and this percentage may have been even lower if all CCGs had supplied the necessary figures. \n“It is absolutely vital that CCGs spend their budgets effectively given the limited resources in general practice”.
