Here are six quick takeaways from the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series’ only visit to Georgia this year. Getty Images Getty Images 1 Stewart-Haas Racing It’s looking more and more like Stewart-Haas Racing’s decision to move to Ford Motor Co. was brilliant for both sides. SHR’s Kurt Busch won the Daytona 500 and Harvick was far and away the best in the field at Atlanta, with Clint Bowyer turning in an excellent performance before losing a tire and hitting the wall late in the race. And Keselowski’s win means Ford is 2-for-2 in Cup races this year. Shanna Lockwood Shanna Lockwood-USA TODAY Sports 2 Speeding The Atlanta race saw more pit-road penalties than a speed trap in a rural Southern town on a holiday weekend. Jimmie Johnson and Matt Kenseth each got busted twice, and Chase Elliott, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Martin Truex Jr. were among the drivers who were penalized. All told, more than 10 pit-road speeding penalties were levied, but none was more crushing than the one Harvick got that cost him the victory after leading 293 laps. Getty Images Getty Images 3 Repave Atlanta is scheduled to be repaved before the next race in March 2018, but after the drivers complained, Marcus Smith, the CEO of track owner Speedway Motorsports Inc., said they may look at delaying the new pavement for a year. Good. Atlanta produces some of the best racing there is, and the ultra-abrasive pavement chews tires up like Darlington used to. Don’t fix what isn’t broken. Getty Images Getty Images 4 Stages I still like the idea of stage racing, because it forces drivers and teams to run hard and plot strategy for the entire race, not just the last 100 miles. But here’s a bold thought: At a long, 500-mile race like Atlanta, which averages nearly four hours, you could easily get away with four stages. Or maybe even five. Now that would be exciting. Getty Images Getty Images 5 Joe Gibbs Racing Last year, JGR stomped the competition for much of the season. This year, they’ve been mediocre in the first two races of the year. Kyle Busch and Daniel Suarez struggled all day, Denny Hamlin burned up a rear hub and Matt Kenseth had two pit-road speeding penalties. At Daytona, Hamlin was the top JGR finisher in 17 th . Here, the highest-finishing JGR driver was Kenseth, who rallied back to finish third, while Busch was 16 th , Suarez 21 st and Hamlin 39 th . Shanna Lockwood Shanna Lockwood-USA TODAY Sports 6 Chase Elliott He still hasn’t won his first Cup race, but Elliott nearly won both the Daytona 500 and the Atlanta race. This young man is going to be a tremendous talent. It would not surprise me at all if he contends for a championship this year.
