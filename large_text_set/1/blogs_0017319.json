The 37-year-old reality star took to Snapchat on Friday to show off how she spent her rainy day: baking with her daughter, Penelope, and her niece, North West. 3-year-old North adorably smiles for the camera in the cute pic while sitting on Kourtney's kitchen island with 4-year-old Penelope and another pal. Photo: Snapchat WATCH: North West Plays Makeup Artist With Khloe Kardashian -- and She Takes Her Job Very Serious Food is clearly something that never fails to put a smile on Nori's face. Kim Kardashian recently shared photos of North's visit to the White House, including a pic where her daughter just couldn't seem to hold back tears in a photo op with Barack Obama. Kim later took to Twitter to explain the reason North was crying : she wanted M&Ms! \"Northie! She fell & was crying,\" the Selfish author wrote. \"Potus gave her White House M&Ms& I wanted 2 save them 4 memories so wouldn't let her eat them & she cried again.\" See the hilarious photo in the video below.
