Today, the company has launched the phone in India. The Galaxy C9 Pro is the brand’s first smartphone to boast a beefy 6GB of RAM. The high-end phablet flaunts a metal unibody frame, split antenna band design and a fingerprint sensor that’s embedded into its home button. \nAs far as the other specs go, the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro features a large 6-inch full HD Super AMOLED display, and boots Android Marshmallow with TouchWiz UI on top. The processor under the hood is an octa-core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 processor, coupled with Adreno 510 graphics and 6GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of internal memory, further expandable via a microSD card. \nThe Galaxy C9 Pro sports a 16-megapixel primary shooter with a dual-LED flash and f/1.9 aperture.
