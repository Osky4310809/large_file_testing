Donning a wedding dress and sitting back-to-back on a bench with her pianist, the singer delivered a sparse, understated rendition of the track. \nIn addition to her musical performances, Lorde also popped up in the closing seconds of SNL 's \"A Sketch for the Women,\" where Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney hijack her rendition of \"Royals\". \nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, Lorde revealed that she was inspired to pen the song after hearing Rihanna's \"Higher\" while in a cab; the track opens with the lyric, \"Baby really hurt me / Crying in a taxi.\" \n\"I had a little cry and I was just like 'It's always going to be this way, at some point with everyone it's going to be this way,'\" Lorde told Lowe. \"But the song kind of ended up turning into a bit of a protective talismans for me. I was like, you know what, I'm always gonna have myself so I have to really nurture this relationship and feel good about hanging out with myself and loving myself.\" More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T16:17:50.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
