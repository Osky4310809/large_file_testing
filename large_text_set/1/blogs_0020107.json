The best example of this happened when Union proclaimed that Jimmy Butler was crossed off of the familyâ€™s BBQ list due to Butlerâ€™s antics on the bench during a Bulls game. Union has also shown that sheâ€™s not afraid to get on her husbandâ€™s case when heâ€™s not getting the job done on the court â€“ she once called Wade out for not doing what he needed to do to secure a rebound during a game.\nThe pair decided to get some laughs at the expense of a reporter on Sunday. Frank Isola of the New York Daily News made a comment about Wade getting the benefit of the doubt from officials after he benefitted from a controversial call late in Chicagoâ€™s win against Sacramento.\nDwayne Wade leads a charmed life & I'm not even referring to Gabby Union. How many guys can come up short on a dunk & get bailed out by refs\nâ€” Frank Isola (@FisolaNYDN) January 22, 2017 \n\nSure, Isola had a point while discussing the foul at the end of the game, but this was still a pretty weird tweet.
