Their soft, sticky cinnamon buns are my favourite in all of London - order the blueberry, oat and spelt muffin titled ‘studmuffin’, purely for the name. 61 Great Titchfield Street, W1W 7PP; scandikitchen.co.uk 2/37 Violet Cakes \nThis unassuming shop front on Wilton Way hides a charming little café with an open kitchen and big-table shared seating area upstairs, run by Californian Claire Ptak. Icings on their vanilla cupcakes change with the seasons; expect rhubarb at the moment, Fragola grapes in the autumn (apparently Claire’s favourite) and summer fruits in – you’ve guessed it – the summer. The chocolate cake with salted caramel icing is divine and a year-round favourite and I’m told that the cinnamon buns are so popular they sell out by lunch. 47 Wilton Way, E8 3ED; violetcakes.com 3/37 Fleet River Bakery \nAs well as serving an ever popular weekend brunch and doling out quiches and sandwiches to the hungry lunchtime crowds, this Fleet River Bakery has a heavily-loaded counter of cakes and bakes. The brownies are a firm favourite, as is the chocolate Guinness cake when they have it, but don't miss the Hummingbird – coconut, banana and pineapple cake with a cream cheese icing – which was sweet-but-not-too-sweet in that dangerous way that means you could eat it all day. 71 Lincolns Inn Fields, WC2A 3JF; fleetriverbakery.com 4/37 St John Bakery \nThe St John group may supply bread to trendy food destinations like Caravan in King’s Cross and do a darn good Welsh rarebit, but it’s their doughnuts we’re really interested in. Pop down to the bakery room under the railway arches at Maltby Street market for white brick walls, a stainless steel bar and – most importantly – a brilliant seasonal jam doughnut (cross your fingers for rhubarb). Ingredients are sourced from independent suppliers, including dairy from Neal’s Yard just down the road. 41 Maltby Street, SE1 3PA; stjohngroup.com 5/37 Marc Patisserie \nThis Selfridge’s boutique sits at the highest point of London’s high-end sweet scene. It’s run by Marlon Abela who is chairman of MARC restaurants (including restaurants The Greenhouse and Umu ) and specialises in patisserie, macarons and chocolates. The eclairs are a highlight — in flavours such as English breakfast tea, banoffee, cassis and elderflower. Selfridges, 400 Oxford Street, W1A 1AB; marcpatisserie.com 6/37 Victoria Yum \nThis Netil Market whips up an array of cakes which are moist, rich and gooey without crossing into sickly territory. Layer cakes include courgette, pistachio and lime; banana and salted caramel; and stout, dark chocolate and blackcurrant varieties. The red velvet cupcakes are also worth a try, while for those with special dietary requirements there are numerous options including the chocolate, avocado and fresh berry cake which is free from dairy and eggs. Netil Market, Westgate Street, E8 3RL; victoriayum.com 7/37 Nordic Bakery \nAnother Scandinavian import, the Nordic Bakery does a different sort of cinnamon bun to the Scandinavian Kitchen: denser with thinner layers of dough and shaped like a pain au chocolat, but still delicious. Pair one with a strong coffee, a paper and the dark wood and pared-down Scandi-style of the Soho branch and you’ve got some great fika material. If it’s a nice day, take it to go and find a place to perch in Golden Square outside. 14A Golden Square, W1F 9JG; nordicbakery.com 8/37 Outsider Tart \nOutsider Tart was started by a couple of guys from New York who missed authentic American home-baking. The brownies are downright sinful - try the chocolate cherry cheesecake one and the Alabama fudge bar (brownie with pecans and toasted marshmallow) - before moving on to the rum and raisin blondie with chocolate chips and butterscotch. We defy you not to leave in a complete food coma. They also sell biscuits and “pupcakes” for your dog, if you’re so inclined. 83 Chiswick High Road, W4 2EF; outsidertart.com 9/37 Orée \nThis plush Chelsea café offers an excellent range of freshly baked viennoiserie and patisserie along with artisan breads and breakfast and lunch dishes. Top pickings include delicate cannelés with creamy custard centres, financiers and dense but dreamy kugelhofs. 275-277 Fulham Road, SW10 9PZ; oree.co.uk 10/37 Old Post Office Bakery \nThis humble old-school bakery is a local Clapham gem and one of the first to go all-organic in South London. The date and walnut bread is that perfect balance of sweet and savoury that makes it great for a grab-and-go breakfast, or, on a sunny weekend, pick up a couple of hot pain au chocolat and eat them as you amble along to the common. 76 Landor Road, SW9 9PH; oldpostofficebakery.co.uk 11/37 Cocomaya \nCocomaya is much more warm and cosy than its seductive sister chocolatier next door, which is perhaps surprising given the backgrounds of its founders (an ex-Agent Provocateur owner, a fashion designer and the former head of concept at Liberty). They do a great changing selection of crodoughs – including tiramisu, meringue and pistachio – and a smashing flourless chocolate cake that’s almost mousse-like. 12 Connaught Street, W2 2AF; cocomaya.co.uk 12/37 Bea's Cake Boutique \nBea’s of Bloomsbury is well-known for its afternoon teas, but it also does a mean selection of individual treats. It's a great fan of the cake hybrid – there’s the townie (tart-brownie) and the duffin (the donut-muffin that they won a legal battle against Starbucks over) – and the raspberry chocolate layer cake and the peanut butter jelly slice are both divine. There are soon to be six Bea's across London, so it's not just Bloomsbury that's in on the act. beasofbloomsbury.com 13/37 Maison Bertaux \nMaison Bertaux claims to be the oldest patisserie in London (established in 1871), and with no way to verify that we’re inclined to trust them – the old-school till certainly supports it. If nothing else, it’s certainly a Soho institution, partly because it hasn’t followed the lead of many other successful bakeries and gone corporate, and partly because the patisserie is just so good. The almond and apricot cake is lovely, as are the cheesecake and eclairs. 28 Greek Street, W1D 5DF; maisonbertaux.com 14/37 La Patisserie Des Reves \nThis one translates as ‘the patisserie of dreams’ – pretty big boots to fill, but this first London outpost for the Parisian patisserie chain doesn’t disappoint. The decor is clean and modern, with a clever cake dome pulley system (you’ll just have to go to understand) and the fare is excellent. Try a red fruit charlotte (lime sponge, matcha tea, vanilla cream, raspberry mouse and fresh compote), a cafe doux (nut biscuit, coffee-flavoured croustillant and mousseline, covered in nutty streusel) – both seasonal – or the year-round Paris-Brest, filled with praline cream. 43 Marylebone High Street, W1U 5HE; lapatisseriedesreves.com 15/37 Comptoir Gourmand \nFinish your Maltby Street tour a few doors down from St John at Comptoir Gourmand. Grab some French patisserie with a beautifully tart tarte au citron, pistachio financier or a perfect chocolate eclair. Aussies in England will appreciate the Laminations – Victoria sponge dipped in chocolate and rolled in coconut. 98 Druid Street, SE1 2HQ; comptoirgourmand.co.uk 16/37 Ottolenghi \nThe array of cakes and desserts displayed in the windows of Ottolenghi delis across town is awe-inspiring. You can’t really go wrong with the cakes, which change daily, but if you can get it go for a passion fruit meringue tart and the cheesecakes are perfection – we enjoyed a salted caramel and hazelnut one. The Spitalfields location is the biggest Ottolenghi venue. ottolenghi.co.uk 17/37 Crumbs and Doilies \nSomehow, in London's cupcake-saturated market, Crumbs and Doilies has built up a cult following. Owned by Jemma Wilson (known on YouTube to her 670,000+ followers as CupcakeJemma), this bakery in foodie haven Kingly Court is decked out in clean white and blue and has a giant rotating menu of 50-60 flavours. The choice is overwhelming but we love Mexican hot choc, buttered popcorn and chocolate Guinness. 1 Kingly Court, W1B 5PW; crumbsanddoilies.co.uk 18/37 Lily Vanilli \nIf you find icing-heavy cupcakes too sickly, Lily Vanilli is your cake holy grail: savoury and sweet are balanced perfectly to create complex flavours, not just an immediate sugar hit. Think pear, thyme and olive oil mini-loaves and grapefruit and polenta layer cake. Tucked away in a gorgeous little courtyard behind Columbia Road flower market, the bakery has bare brick and white tile walls, a fab ‘Vanilli’s’ lightbulb sign and a wooden counter laden with treats. Only open Sundays. 6 The Courtyard, Ezra St, E2 7RH; lilyvanilli.com 19/37 E5 Bakehouse \nHead to the E5 Bakehouse under the railway arches at London Fields for a changing menu of cakes, tarts and patisserie, from brownies and perfectly-formed raspberry financiers to classic eccles cakes and crème brulee tarts. The seating area is small and, between the open kitchen and trains running overhead, a little noisy, but in a typically east London bustling way. And the pecan pie is – and I’m only slightly exaggerating – the best I’ve tasted this side of the Atlantic. Arch 395, Mentmore Terrace, E8 3PH; e5bakehouse.com 20/37 Bageriet \nAnother Scandi bakery to add to the list, this one hails from Sweden. The white and pale wood interior is clean and understated but it is tiny so be prepared to queue, particularly for semlor and kanelbulle. For something less predictable, try a vanilla sugar pretzel or mazarintarta – a shortbread crust tart filled with almond paste and, at Bageriet, topped with white icing. 24 Rose Street, WC2E 9EA; bageriet.co.uk 21/37 Kooky Bakes \nThis food market regular prides itself on small-batch baking and the quality of its cakes reflects this. Must-order cupcakes are the malted chocolate, rocky road and the blueberry and blackberry ‘black and blue’ (I will resist making a ‘the dress’ joke). If you’re not full already, finish up with an incredible S’mores brownie. Saturdays at Brockley Market, SE4 1UT; kookybakes.com 22/37 Gail's Bakery \nYou can find Gail’s in numerous different locations, but the King’s Road one makes the list simply for its classic black shop front that reminds us of a Victorian apothecary. Its cinnamon buns are a little crispier than the traditional soft dough kanelbulle but still delicious, and their chocolate pecan brownies are possibly the best in London. 209 King’s Road, SW3 5ED; gailsbread.co.uk 23/37 Bad Brownie \nIt may not be a sit-in bakery, but Bad Brownie’s market stall at Maltby Street is a definite cake destination. Brownie flavours range from the traditional (triple chocolate, salted caramel, peanut butter) to the more creative (rose, raspberry and pistachio, ginger crunch). You’ll struggle to commit to one flavour, so we suggest you take a tasting box home. weekends at Maltby Street Market, SE1 2HQ; badbrownie.co.uk Tavi Ionescu 24/37 Hummingbird Bakery \nNo cake guide would be complete without mentioning Hummingbird, one of the first big-name cupcake cafes in London after the cupcake craze travelled across the pond from the Magnolia Bakery in New York (thanks, in part, to Sex and the City). Fare is properly American, from whoopie pies to Mississippi mud pie, via some very brightly coloured icing, and the classic carrot cake is legendary. There are six branches across London, but the original Notting Hill one remains the best. 133 Portobello Road, W11 2DY; hummingbirdbakery.com 25/37 Biscuiteers \nThe shelves and shelves of perfectly-piped biscuit wonders at The Biscuiteers boutique incite a sort of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory-esque wonder. Its huge range of themed tins make great gifts for any occasion and you can have a go at icing your own at the ‘icing cafe’. 194 Kensington Park Road, W11 2ES; biscuiteers.com 26/37 Balthazar Boulangerie \nStepping into this little gem (found next to the restaurant), with its brushed gold walls, mosaic tiled floors and eclectic soundtrack of blues and jazz feels like simultaneously stepping back in time and travelling to Paris. Highlights are the galettes: the best-selling apple and hazelnut and the seasonal rhubarb and custard both go down a treat. 4-6 Russell Street, WC2B 5HZ; balthazarlondon.com 27/37 Bake-a-Boo \nThis unashamedly-kitsch and very pink tea shop in West Hampstead is the place to go for all kinds of dietary requirements. You’ll find wheat-, gluten-, dairy-, egg- and sugar-free treats so no one misses out and the fireplace and picture-lined walls make it feel homely; a great place for a relaxed spot of afternoon tea and a giggle. 86 Mill Lane, NW6 1NL; bake-a-boo.com Xanthe Berkeley 28/37 Betty Blythe Tea Room \nBetty Blythe’s is the ultimate bunting and mismatched vintage crockery destination for a Twenties-inspired afternoon tea. The tea room is nostalgia-filled with pretty French-style furniture, jars of old school sweets and a counter heaped with cakes and too many varieties of tea to count. Its afternoon tea menu includes classics like cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, scones with all the works, a selection of the day’s cakes and Earl Grey tea – and there’s even a dressing up box downstairs so you can do it in 1920s flapper style. 73 Blythe Road, W14 0HP; bettyblythe.co.uk 29/37 BB Bakery \nThe clean white brick of the BB Bakery shopfront is continued inside with a classy and simple exterior; afternoon tea here feels a bit like being at a smart hotel, except more relaxed. The menu includes scones, fruit tarts, macarons and seasonal cakes, all of which are excellently made. For a bit of novelty, it also does afternoon tea aboard a sightseeing bus; the skill involved in serving while turning corners is apparently quite remarkable. 6-7 Chandos Place, WC2N 4HU; bbbakery.co.uk 30/37 Ms Cupcake \nVegans rejoice, Ms Cupcake is London’s first completely vegan bakery; no slightly sad-looking single vegan options here. And there’s a flavour range bigger than most standard cupcake shops: raspberry cheesecake, Ferrero Rocher, green tea, tiramisu, chocolate strawberry, rhubarb custard – the list goes on. Be warned: the seating, while covered, is outside, so you might want to get it to go if it's a bit nippy. 408 Coldharbour Lane, SW9 8LF; mscupcake.co.uk 31/37 Rinkoff's \nRinkoffs is a family bakery that's been in Whitechapel since 1911 and remains gladly untouched by the spread of east London cool. Don’t be put off by the modest approach (single storey plus dated awning), the ‘Crodoughs’ are worth travelling for. With raspberry, toffee apple crumble, Oreo cheesecake, salted caramel pistachio and s’mores (Nutella and marshmallow fluff), you’re going to get serious FOMO whatever you choose, so we suggest you make it a box of six to go. 224 Jubilee Street, E1 3BS; rinkoffbakery.co.uk 32/37 Kipferl \nScandi baking may be big in London, but Austrian, less so. Kipferl is technically a restaurant (complete with wood panelling, industrial lighting and an entire page of the menu dedicated to wurst) but the cakes are authentic and delicious. This is the best place in the capital to sample the beautifully glossy Sachertorte of Great British Bake Off technical challenge fame. 95 Golborne Road, W10 5NL; kipferl.co.uk 33/37 Ayres the Bakers \nAyres is a properly traditional family bakery, complete with 1950s-style brown tile floors and glass counters, selling almost every kind of cake, bread and pastry that you can imagine. Master baker Vincent’s cronuts are supposedly some of the best (and best value) in London and rumour has it that after opening doors at 6am they’re all gone an hour later. 131-33 Evelina Road, SE15 3HB; ayresbakery.com 34/37 Peggy Porschen Parlour \nPeggy Porschen seems to spend most her time making bespoke creations for the rich and famous, but the lesser among us can get a slice of the action at her café in Belgravia. Her cakes are perfectly uniform and they pack a great flavour punch, too. Try the Tipsy Orange Truffle cake: orange and Cointreau sponge with marmalade and chocolate ganache. The shop is very pretty in pink (inside and out), but hey, if it’s good enough for Kate Moss’s wedding cake, it’s good enough for us. 116 Ebury Street, SW1W 9QQ; peggyporschen.com 35/37 Konditor and Cook \nThis mini-chain has been baking on this site in Waterloo since 1993 (pre-Jubilee line, would you believe) and the sheer popularity of the cakes speaks for themselves. Those that have gained a cult following include the Whiskey Bomb (chocolate, orange and whiskey), the Curly Whirly cake (chocolate and vanilla sponge with cream cheese frosting and a wily of chocolate icing) and Magic Cakes – gorgeous little lemon sponge cakes covered in marzipann and fondant (and nothing like pot brownies we promise). 22 Cornwall Road, SE1 8TW; konditorandcook.com 36/37 Dum Dum Donutterie \nThe dynamic doughnuts at this store are sprayed in oil and then baked (the method is patented) so you’ll feel marginally less guilty when you eat three in a row. The most popular is the Zebra (layered plain and chocolate croissant dough, filled with chocolate buttercream and topped with dark chocolate) and owner Paul, who previously worked at Dunkin Donuts, tells me that a little-too-late customer once paid £5 to the person in front of him in the queue who got the last one. The banoffee doughnut (banana, custard, Dulce de Leche) and the simple pistachio and white chocolate are also delicious. Unit 31 Box Park, 2-4 Bethnal Green Road, E1 6GY; dumdums.co.uk 37/37 Cake Boy Cafe \nIf you’re a fan of hunky French patissier Eric Lanlard from his Channel 4 show Baking Mad (and, really, who isn’t?), his Cake Boy cafe is well worth a trip south of the river. Decor is bold and modern – no twee florals here – with black walls and hot pink and orange details and the patisserie is creative. You’ll have to book onto one of the cafe’s classes to have a chance of meeting the man himself, though. Kingfisher House, Juniper Drive, SW18 1TX; cake-boy.co.uk \nThe Evening Standard is proud to announce the launch of London Food Month , Britain's biggest food festival, taking place across the capital this June.
