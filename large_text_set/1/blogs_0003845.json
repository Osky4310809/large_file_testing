Credit: PA/PA Nicola Harley 7 January 2017 â€¢ 1:15pm \nT he BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has been accused of breaching impartiality guidelines in a draft report over her dispatch on Jeremy Corbyn's shoot-to-kill policy. \nA leaked copy of the BBC Trust's draft report into her piece for News at Six said that there had been a \"failure of impartiality\". \nHer report had focused on the Labour leader's views on shoot-to-kill after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015.

Credit: Paul Grover/Paul Grover \nA viewer complained that the clip was misleading because Mr Corbyn had been asked if he would order the police or military to shoot to kill on Britain's streets without any reference to the Paris attacks. \nA prerecorded interview showed the Labour leader responding: \"I'm not happy with a shoot-to-kill policy in general. I think that is quite dangerous and I think can often be counterproductive.\" \nThe BBC Trust's editorial standards committee said that Mr Corbyn had not been specifically asked about a hostage incident, such as the Bataclan theatre siege in Paris, in which 89 people were killed in relation t the question. \nIn its initial findings the regulator, which has not interviewed Ms Kuenssberg, concluded: \"There was a significant difference between what Mr Corbyn said and what the report inferred. This led to a failure of due accuracy.\" A memorial outside the Bataclan in Paris following the 2015 terror attack.
