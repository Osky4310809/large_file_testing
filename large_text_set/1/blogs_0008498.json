In news Beauty and the Beast fans probably didn’t expect to read today, Emma Watson’s Belle doll is a Justin Bieber look-alike . Because apparently, everyone who works at Disney’s doll-making factory has face blindness and cannot tell a Harry Potter legend from the dude who peed on his dressing room floor that one time.\nAnd fans of Watson who are eagerly anticipating her take on the fan-favorite Disney Princess, of course, have OPINIONS. Who made this Emma Watson toy? Did they only have a picture of Justin Bieber to work from? I mean it's 100% Justin Bieber going to his prom pic.twitter.com/6zmy55s8LB \n— TAYLØR (@TaylorAmesMusic) January 9, 2017 Though some have noticed the doll’s resemblance to another major male celebrity. Have you seen the @EmmaWatson Belle doll? Who does it look more like? Justin Bieber or Nicholas Cage? DJ @_jazreyes and @angeloandres asks pic.twitter.com/O9UVN0GeXu \n— 99.5 Play FM (@995PlayFM) January 9, 2017 … And another major female celebrity. either caitlyn jenner or justin bieber w a wig and dress but don't you dare tell me you're gonna try and pass this thing off as emma watson pic.twitter.com/Iz2Qyu7QIC \n— jacq (@pliffs_) January 7, 2017 Just, you know, not Watson herself. oh my god why does this look like me pic.twitter.com/8PNJ29fs0i \n— jacob whitesides (@JacobWhitesides) January 9, 2017 It’s all pretty hilarious, but at the same time, kind of crappy for Disney collectors who were psyched to get their hands on some new Belle merch. At least the live action Beauty and the Beast happens to look more and more amazing with each trailer , especially now that we’ve actually seen Watson sing .\n& \nPosted by Emma Watson on Monday, January 9, 2017 Yeah, sorry guys — the Bieber thing is 100 percent forgiven now that we’ve heard Watson croon “I want adventure in the great wide somewhere.” March 17th cannot come quickly enough.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:16:20.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
