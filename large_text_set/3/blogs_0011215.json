Execute the initial orders of terrorits. They can be people with unhealthy state of mind and behave unpredictable. \n\"Try to get into a contact with terrorists/ Try to keep in mind how they look like, their habits, how and with whom they speak to. \n\"Try to remember all movements, including the time in motion, direction, distance, speed, any reference points along the road.\" \nThat's a lot of stuff to remember when you're being held hostage. The advice seems to be a normal thing for guests at the hotel (Photo: Getty) \nStill, it's better to be safe than sorry, right? \nMatt told other Twitter users that the unidentified hotel was \"very run down but the people so far are very pleasant\" and that he hadn't seen any trouble. \nThe tweet has since been shared and 'liked' nearly 3,000 times. \nOfficial Home Office advice to tourists in Russia warns that petty crime, muggings and thefts are rife in cities. \nThe threat of terrorism also remains ‘high’, according to the Home Office.
