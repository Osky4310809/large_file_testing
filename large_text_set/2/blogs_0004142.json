You don’t live in the present moment. If you are constantly thinking about what you need to do tomorrow or next month, you aren’t focusing on what’s happening now . Pay attention to this exact moment and be mindful about where your thoughts are taking you.\n2. You focus on your five year plan too much. Freaking out about your five year plan is doing nothing but hurting your self- esteem and your mental health. The truth is, no one can plan out and say for sure what is going to happen to them in five years, so you might as well start living for yourself right now.\n3. You focus on what you don’t have instead of what you do have. By putting yourself down and comparing yourself to other in regards to what they have and what you don’t have, you are truly ruining your ability to see how awesome you are. Try to focus on the things you have already accomplished and the positive aspects of your life. See the beauty in the journey instead of wanting to always race ahead.\n4. You spend a lot of time alone. Don’t get me wrong, spending time alone is great, but if you are finding yourself doing it too much, you could be isolating yourself without even knowing it. Try to call up a friend, or a family member and catch up with your loved ones. Social interaction can do wonders to your mood.\n5. You drink too much. Alcohol is a depressant . Watch how much you drink per week and see how you feel when you decrease your weekly amount.\n6. You remain friends with people who leave you feeling worse about yourself. Let go of those toxic relationships. You are too smart and too precious to surround yourself with people who don’t truly care about you. Although it may be difficult to have that conversation, you need to say goodbye to negative friendships and feel that weight lift off of your shoulders.\n7. You’re still hopelessly in love with your ex. If you’re still in love with your ex who has clearly moved on and it’s been two years, you need to block them and move the fuck on. And please make sure to work on yourself and on loving yourself first before jumping into another serious relationship.\n8. You choose jobs based on the salary instead of whether or not you would enjoy it. Money can’t buy you happiness. Ever. So while it may be great for a while and you feel on top of the world with your new promotion, having a job that you hate no matter how much money you make, will never be worth it in the end.\n9. You don’t take enough risks. I’m not much of a risk taker but if I ever do end up doing activities or saying things that are something I rarely say, I feel more free and more alive. Be bold in your actions and choices. Be different than everyone else.\n10. You follow everything that your parents tell you to do. Look, parents are freaking amazing, but if you listen to everything that they say to you and you do exactly as you are told , you aren’t thinking for yourself and you ultimately are going to be following their dreams, not your own. Have your own voice and make your own path instead of following one that has already been created.\n11. You don’t even attempt to follow your dreams because you think it’s impossible and silly. If you aren’t following your personal goals, aspirations, and dreams, then what are you doing? Please don’t listen to those people who tell you, you can’t do it, or you aren’t good enough. Go for it. And if you fail, at least you did something.\n12. You are too focused on being successful. There is nothing wrong with success of course, but if you are constantly looking to be the next big thing and are too obsessed with the idea of success, you aren’t going to be very happy in your life. Success isn’t everything this life can give you.\n13. You spend a lot of time on social media. It’s so easy to get wrapped up in the internet world that you can end up losing yourself from spending too much time comparing yourself to others. Social media isn’t real life. It is filters and retouches and airbrushed skin. It’s all fake, so don’t get too caught up in the glamour of it all.\n14. You complain too much. Honestly, complaining won’t get you anywhere in this world, and it’s not attractive whatsoever. Count your blessings.\n15. You never do anything outside of your comfort zone. Like going on a first date, or going out somewhere new, you need to jump out of the bubble that you live in. Experience new food and different types of people. Date the guy who isn’t your type at all. Set foot on completely different landscapes and watch your world and your mind expand.\n16. You ignore your mental health. Your mental and emotional health is so, so vital to your life and your happiness. Don’t ever be ashamed of seeing a therapist or getting prescribed medicine. If you need help, it’s better to get it, than to ignore the situation.\n17. You stay at your job because it’s the safe thing to do. If you are unhappy at your job, for god’s sake – LEAVE. No one is stopping you. Do something good for yourself and find a job that brings you joy instead of despair.\n18. You shut people out when you’re feeling blue. While it’s normal to shut people out when you are feeling down, it’s so much better to be open and honest in how you are feeling. Have a quick phone call with your best friend. Give a visit to your mom. Stop bottling up your feelings until they explode in front of you.\n19. You never follow your gut instinct. If your gut is telling you not to do something, don’t do it. If your gut is telling you not to drink that fourth drink, don’t do it. If your gut is telling you not to date that person, don’t do it. Your natural instincts kick in for a reason, and you should follow that.\n20. You spend too much time counting calories instead of actually enjoying what you are eating. Seriously, life is way too short to spend so much of your time focusing on your image and counting every single calorie that’s in your breakfast muffin. Try to live life with less structure and less harshness. Eat food that provides you with nutrients, that taste good, and above all, that make you feel good. And please have that second slice of cake. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:01:25.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
