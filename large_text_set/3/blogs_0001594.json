In recent years, most teams had taken running backs much later in the draft, opting to address other positions instead of one they believed could be easily filled. \nFast-forward almost a year, and the Cowboys look like geniuses for taking Elliott, who went on to lead the NFL in rushing and be named Offensive Rookie of the Year. Will other NFL teams change their draft strategy as a result of Elliott’s immediate success? \nLeonard Fournette, who many predict will be the first running back taken this year, sure hopes so. The former LSU star was asked Thursday at the Combine what impact Elliott’s stellar season will have on this year’s crop of rookie running backs. \n“It helped us completely,” said Fournette, who averaged 120.4 yards per game last season. “It showed that he’s not just a running back. He can help in the passing game. He can run, he can block. And I think he led a great way for these running backs coming out right now.” Leonard Fournette on how much Ezekiel Elliott's rookie year helped this year's RB class: pic.twitter.com/Xg0DRymkZu \n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) March 2, 2017 \nAnother running back prospect who could crack the top 10 is former Florida State standout Dalvin Cook, who also was asked about Elliott’s impact. \n“Zeke did pave the way for us,” said Cook, who ran for 19 touchdowns in 2016. “Todd Gurley, Melvin Gordon, all those guys. They paved the way for us. Zeke does a great job of catching the ball out of the backfield, protecting Dak [Prescott] at quarterback and running very well behind a good offensive line.” Dalvin Cook on how much Ezekiel Elliott helped this year's RB class: pic.twitter.com/KM0J128VEc \n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) March 2, 2017 \nSince 2007, only six running backs – Adrian Peterson, Darren McFadden, C.J. Spiller, Trent Richardson, Todd Gurley and Elliott – have been taken in the top 10. Will we see another one in 2017?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:30:25.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
