According to Metro , the newest establishment looking to satisfy our relentless avocado cravings is an avocado-themed eatery opening in Amsterdam. \nSimply titled The Avocado Show, owners Julien Zaal and Ron Simpson, and chef Jaimie van Heije, have vowed to incorporate the trendy ingredient into every dish they serve. The menu covers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night eats, and it includes nutrient-packed offerings like avocado fries, avocado ice cream, avocado smoothies, and burgers served on avocado buns . \nAccording to The Avocado Show's Facebook page , the restaurant will open its doors in Amsterdam’s De Pijp neighborhood sometime in February 2017.
