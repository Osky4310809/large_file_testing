The man – who is reportedly the North Korean leader’s half-brother – died shortly afterwards, on the way to the hospital. \nA North Korean man, a Vietnamese woman, and an Indonesian woman thought to be linked to the assassination have already been detained. \nMalaysian police also said they are still looking for four other suspects, who are supposedly from North Korea. \nKim Jong-nam, who was an outspoken opponent of his brother, had been living with his second wife in Macau under China’s protection, according to South Korea’s intelligence agency. \nSeoul openly accused North Korea of the murder in their statement on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:40:01.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
