The idea that they would create significant numbers of jobs is laughable. The threat they represent to the environment—both directly, and indirectly—is sizable. But the money Trump was handed by pipeline promoters didn’t stop at contributing to his campaign. They put big cash directly in his pocket. \nAnd now they get their reward. \nPresident Donald Trump intends to sign two executive actions today that would advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, according to a person familiar with the matter. \nFor the thousands who have participated in protests leading to a reevaluation and eventual halt on these projects, this is a direct slap in the face. For Trump’s backers in the oil industry, it’s a big fat reward. One that will not only affect the balance of trade , and export oil jobs to Canada. \nKeystone XL would wipe out the U.S. trade surplus, and a hike in the price of oil to $75 or $80 a barrel would suddenly turn it to deficit. \nThe oil for the Keystone pipeline comes from tar sands deposits in Canada that produce much more pollution than other types of oil production. x \nTrump: Ã¢ÂÂI am, to a large extent, an environmentalist. Believe me. But it is, to a large extent, out of control\" — Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) January 24, 2017 \nYour feelings on the pipeline aside, it's well-established among scientists that extraction of oil from these oil sands (also known as tar sands) is environmentally dicey. The petroleum found in them doesn't flow easily like conventional crude—it's a sticky, viscous type formally known as bitumen but more commonly known as tar—so companies have to resort to alternate measures, either surface mining (digging up the rock or sand covering the oil-laden sediment) or injecting steam to get it out of the Earth. \nThis uses up an enormous amount of water, distributes toxic metals into the surrounding watershed and perhaps most important leads to an estimated 14 percent higher level of greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil, because some natural gas must be burned simply to convert the bitumen into a usable form. \nBut don’t worry. With the EPA grants shut down and communications cut off , you won’t be hearing any more of this unpleasant information. That same goes for Trump’s promise to auto executives that he’s going to cut environmental regulations. \nThe Water Protectors and others who have worked so hard to keep these pipeline projects from being completed, will now shoulder an even greater burden against hostile forces that have the backing of the government. The big question will be: How many others step up to join them?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T17:25:05.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
