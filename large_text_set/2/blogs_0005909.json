Well, if you've got a Pelican hard case it just might be. B&H put the manufacturer's new line of Pelican Air cases to the ultimate battle test, dropping it off of buildings, shooting paintballs at it, and finally, throwing it into a burning trash can. Check out the video below to see how well it held up. \nGranted, this video is nothing more than an ad masquerading as a battle test for Pelican's new case, but to be fair, there's a reason why so many filmmakers go with Pelican cases: they work. They're airtight, watertight, crushproof, and dustproof—and I know you can't ethically say they're fire retardant, but still, that case survived a dirty garbage can fire. That's pretty impressive. \nIf you're a Pelican fan, this video from BrandmadeTV not only shows you how the cases are built, but gives you a little history on the company itself, which after 40 years in the business has become the largest manufacturer of protection cases in the world.
