A team of industry veterans launched a Kickstarter campaign today to fund the three-year-long, $1 million project. This game is being created with the blessing of the film’s director, Francis Ford Coppola, and with help from his production company, American Zoetrope.\n“Forty years ago, I set out to make a personal art picture that could hopefully influence generations of viewers for years to come,” said Coppola. “Today, I’m joined by new daredevils, a team who want to make an interactive version of Apocalypse Now , where you are Captain Benjamin Willard amidst the harsh backdrop of the Vietnam War. I’ve been watching video games grow into a meaningful way to tell stories, and I’m excited to explore the possibilities for Apocalypse Now for a new platform and a new generation.”\nAlthough this role-playing game is based on the story of the movie, players will have the option to make different choices and alter the narrative. Each one of these choices will have consequences that may affect their journey in unforeseen ways. Despite being based on a known story, each player will have an entirely different experience during their playthrough. Even with all of the changes players can make, the game will maintain the tone and themes of the original Apocalypse Now .\n\n“We will create a game that challenges what an interactive experience can be; just as the original motion picture challenged the concept of cinema,” said game director, Montgomery Markland. “We are making a game that we are excited to play. We will deliver a greater variety of experience and interaction than is currently available within the relatively static industry.”\nApocalypse Now features a team of developers who have worked on some of the industry’s most notable games. This includes: Rob Auten, who was a lead writer for Gears of War , Battlefield , and Far Cry ; Lawrence Liberty, who executive produced and directed games like Fallout: New Vegas , The Witcher , and DC Universe Online. And Montgomery Markland, who was the lead producer on two successful crowdfunded games: Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera . According to the press release, more developers will be announced in the future.\nThose who back the game on Kickstarter will be treated to a host of exclusive rewards. These include in-game options and props from the actual movie. Among the props is Col. Kilgore’s “Airmobile” surfboard and Col. Kilgore’s death cards. Other rewards include early access to pre-release versions of the game and limited edition Apocalypse Now -themed merchandise. Backers will even get to play with the development team. More rewards will be announced in the future.\nApocalypse Now is set to launch sometime in 2020, with early access coming in 2019 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the film.
