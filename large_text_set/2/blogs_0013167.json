When you keep taking the drugs unnecessarily—say, if your infection is already take care of— it gives bacteria more time to learn how to evade the drugs. And that sets you up for antibiotic resistance in the future. \n“The longer an antibiotic is given, the more likely that the resistant bug will predominate, primarily in the gastrointestinal tract and the skin,” says Dr. Rice. \nWhen that happens, the resistant bug is more likely to spread, especially in hospitals where there are other people who are on antibiotics and may have compromised immune systems. \nBut that doesn’t mean you should ditch your meds as soon as you feel better, he emphasizes. There are some infections—like strep throat, Legionnaires disease, and tuberculosis—that need the full course of antibiotics to be knocked out. (Here are 9 reasons your throat hurts .) \nFor others, though, Dr. Rice recommends talking to your doctor. \n“Generally, if you feel better, it suggests that your immune system has gotten the infection under control,” he says. “There is no one size fits all here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:04:21.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
