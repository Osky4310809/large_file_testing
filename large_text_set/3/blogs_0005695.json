Fortunately, in Canada there are plenty of tax breaks and deductions to take advantage of. Below is a guide to many of the applicable federal rules but be sure to check on credits available in your province as well.

Generally, it allows students 17 and older enrolled at a higher education institution to use their school tuition fees to reduce their taxable income or transfer up to $5,000 worth of credits to their spouse or common law partner, their parents or their grandparents.

You wouldn’t need to use any of your tuition tax credits, because the federal basic personal amount exemption, which is $11,474 this year, already offsets all your income, said Gabrielle Loren, a Vancouver-based CPA. You can pass on $5,000 worth of credits to your spouse, parents or grandparents and carry forward the remaining $1,000 for use against your taxes in the future, added Loren. Because tuition tax credits are non-refundable, they don’t expire until they’re used. So in a scenario where mom and dad and grandma and grandpa are doing just fine financially, you could instead hoard all of the tax credits and use them after you graduate. That can be a nice way to soften the tax blow when you’re just starting out in your career and your budget is often squeezed between low pay and student loans. “I’ve seen cases with my clients who’ve gone through medical school where they wind up paying little or no tax for up to three years after graduation,” said Loren.

Students who attend school abroad generally qualify as well. However, you may not be able to claim the tax credit if you or your parents’ employer is paying or reimbursing your tuition, according to Turbotax . Mind the paperwork: Form T2202A is where Canadian schools identifies what kind of tuition fees each student paid. If you’re abroad, you’ll receive a similar tax slip called TL11. If you want to transfer your credits to someone else, you need to file your tax return even if you have no balance owing, said Loren. You need to claim the tax credit first, and then pass on whatever eligible portion of it to your parents, grandparents or spouse by indicating your’s doing so on the tax slip and signing it. Tuition tax credit transfers are a fairly frequent audit target, said Loren, who used to work at the CRA. So it’s essential to do all the paperwork and keep it for your records.
