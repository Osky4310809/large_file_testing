Thanks to some really great reviews, it has become quite popular with the audience. A fact that gets proved by the first day collection of the film. The Hindi version alone has opened with Rs. 1.65 crore while the cumulative of all the versions bring the total to Rs. 4.25 crore. Taran Adarsh gave out the numbers saying, “#TheGhaziAttack Fri ₹ 1.65 cr. Note: Hindi version… All versions: ₹ 4.25 cr… Excellent word of mouth should ensure a jump in biz.” (Also read: Do you know what was the first thought came into Rana Daggubati and Taapsee Pannu’s mind when The ghazi attack offered to them) \nTaran is not exaggerating at all when he says the word of mouth is strong. Bollywoodlife reviewer too found it extremely invigorating. The review reads, “The cinematography effortlessly transports you to that time period when this classified mission took place. It’s almost as if you are inside the S-21 submarine and fighting the war yourself. The director convinces you of the magnitude of the story, makes you feel its impact just like PNS Ghazi felt it when S21 launched a torpedo at it. If you want to see an inspiring story into which great effort has been put in to make it as real as possible, The Ghazi Attack is definitely for you. Also, there’s Kay Kay Menon.” Hence, the numbers which you can check out once more here. (Read the full review here) #TheGhaziAttack Fri ₹ 1.65 cr. Note: Hindi version… All versions: ₹ 4.25 cr… Excellent word of mouth should ensure a jump in biz. \n— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) February 18, 2017 \nNow we told how this film is a gamechanger in Bollywood today. Submarines are an enclosed space and Bollywood has never believed in being limited by canvas size. But The Ghazi Attack broke that tradition too by becoming the first of a kind film in that genre. Many would say the presence of an Akshay Kumar or any other A-list actor would have boosted its ticket sales. But there was an A Wednesday which became a hit purely based on word of mouth and The Ghazi Attack has that written all over it. And as Adarsh suggested, the biz will jump today and tomorrow thanks to it being a weekend.
