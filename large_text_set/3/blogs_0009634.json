Speaking of which, Robert Downey Jr./Tony Stark has been Iron Man for quite a while in Marvel movies. Maybe it’s getting to be time to give the next generation a chance there, as well? We certainly wouldn’t mind getting more Riri on the screen than just this short.\nGood luck to everyone out there waiting to hear from MIT!\n(image via screengrab)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
