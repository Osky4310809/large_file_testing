Hill are still standing: the Davis Building in downtown Dallas, the Oak Lawn Methodist Church and, most notably, Dallas' fourth City Hall on Harwood Street , often referred to as the Municipal Building. There are a few houses, too, each more than a century old, including a home on Junius Street in the Munger Place Historic District. \nBut you can erase one of those entries from the history books: 4500 Preston Road in Highland Park. \nThe 10,000-square-foot Tudor mansion was constructed in 1912 for cotton man Henry Lee Edwards, co-founder of the Dallas Country Club, and purchased in 1961 by legendary Dallas real estate developer Trammell Crow. And it was torn down Monday morning. Preservationists decry razing of 105-year-old Highland Park mansion, once Trammell Crow's \nThe house, which sits on the shores of Turtle Creek, where Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is a neighbor, was purchased less than a year ago by Dallas banking billionaire and poker player Andy Beal. He paid upwards of $50 million for the house and the six acres upon which it was perched -- and, for reasons he has yet to make public, decided to raze the historic home several weeks ago . \nHighland Park, unlike Dallas, only has unofficial landmarks; this house was one of them, according to the Park Cities Historic and Preservation Society, which has yet to publicly comment on the demolition of this home or, in recent years, those designed by O'Neil Ford .

(Rose Baca/Staff photographer) \nThe excavator, owned by JR Demolition, fired up Monday morning and began bringing down the house. Pieces of it were sold off last month; some of it went to Crow's daughter Lucy Crow Billingsley, who put the house on the market in 2014 after the death of her mother, Margaret Crow. \nTrammell Crow's only daughter, a real estate developer and co-founder of Billingsley Co., said in January she and her brothers were \"all incredibly lucky\" to grow up in that house. But she, like brother and developer Harlan Crow, refused to lament its demise. \n\"Our home was beautiful and the trees magical,\" she wrote in an email. \"But more important than the housing were the people.\" View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:23:55.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
