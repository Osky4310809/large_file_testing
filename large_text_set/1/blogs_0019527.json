I’m not a politician and, as a result, I think voters and taxpayers are looking for change makers.” \nAs soon as O’Leary announced his campaign Wednesday afternoon, the Donald Trump comparisons began rolling in. \n“The only similarity is we both worked with Mark Burnett and we’ve both been successful in reality TV and business, but that’s where the comparisons end,” O’Leary said. \nThe SoftKey co-founder said he is the son of immigrants and “if there was a wall around Canada I wouldn’t exist.” \nDespite their differences, O’Leary, 62, said he looks forward to working with President-elect Trump should he win the election and believes he will do a much better job connecting with Trump than current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \nO’Leary’s goal is to overturn everything socialist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has done. \nYou know Trudeau. \nHe’s the dork who praised Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
