Oscar de la Renta, 2005 President George W Bush and First Lady Laura (Photo: Getty Images) \nInto her second administration, Laura was more comfortable in the public eye and pulled out all the stops in this ice blue and silver embroidered tulle V-neck Oscar de la Renta gown, that was outlined in Austrian crystals. \nLaura also wore de la Renta for a 2001 Vogue photo shoot and at the 2004 Republican National Convention. Laura used her influence to actively promote the American fashion industry. Laura Bush in Michael Faircloth, 2001 Laura Bush with her daughters (Photo: Reuters) \nFor her husband's first inauguration, Laura represented her home state in a red crystal-embroidered gown made by a fellow Texan, in a bid to convey a patriotic message. \nShe also wore pearls like her mother-in-law Barbara. Carrying on the Bush tradition, the look was classic and conservative, whilst the decision to wear Republican red showed her patriotism. Hillary Clinton in Oscar de la Renta, 1997 President Bill Clinton and Hillary (Photo: Reuters) \nIn 1997, the Clintons had become serious Washington power players and they held a record number of 14 inaugural balls. This time around, Hillary Clinton opted for a gown designed by fashion heavy weight Oscar de la Renta. The gown also had a cape, that was reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy's inaugural gown, despite the fact that the two women couldn't have been more different. \nDe la Renta has described his \"friend\" Hillary as \"a symbol of where women want to go.\" \nSadly, when it came to style, Hilary didn't seem to have a clue where she wanted to go, and she failed to convey a consistent message throughout the Clinton administrations. Hillary Clinton in Sarah Phillips, 1993 U.S. President Bill Clinton twirls First Lady Hillary Clinton during the 1993 inaugural ball (Photo: Getty) \nFor her first inaugural ball Hilary was much more devisive. Her violet beaded lace gown was made by a little-known designer, whose work Clinton reportedly first noticed in a Little Rock boutique. The message - we're never to forget where our roots are. \nA driving force in the Clinton administration, tellingly, a confident but often directionless Hilary had already asked Phillips to begin creating sketches for the dress before her husband Bill had even won the election. Barbara Bush in Arnold Scaasi, 1989 Royal-blue gown with velvet bodice and asymmetrically draped silk satin skirt, designed by Arnold Scassi (Photo: Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History) \nBarbara was a grandmother when George was inaugurated in 1989, so this gown was designed to be youthful and take the attention away from her years. \nYou could say it kinda worked as Barbara became known as America's \"most glamorous grandmother.\" \nThe blue velvet and satin gown was designed by Arnold Scaasi, who had been designing clothing worn by first ladies since Mamie Eisenhower. It was a powerful, regal colour, and Scaasi called in 'Barbara Blue'. Her decision to wear pearls, not diamonds, sent out a subtle message, she was traditional, not showy. Nancy Reagan in James Galanos, 1985 Nancy Reagan at the inaugural ball 1985 (Photo: Getty) \nThe Reagans ushered in a new era of glamour to the White House. Despite drawing criticism in 1981 for being 'too lavish,’ it would seem that naughty Nancy didn’t learn her lesson. \nNot only did she wear Galanos for a second time, it was reported that the designer and his staff spent over 300 hours embroidering the beads onto the gown. It was estimated to have cost a staggering $46,000. Proving that Nancy was as in touch with the majority of the American electorate as her husband. Nancy Reagan in James Galanos, 1981 Ronald and Nancy dance at the inaugural ball (Photo: Getty Images) \nRonald’s inaugural celebrations were called the \"most lavish\" in American history. Nancy opted for a gown that reflected this mood. \nThings got off to a shaky start for Nancy whose white beaded, one-shoulder dress with lace over silk satin was criticised for being far to ostentatious, at a time when the country was in the midst of a recession. Rosalynn Carter in Mary Matise for Jimmae, 1977 Former First Lady Rosalynn Smith Carter's 1977 inaugural gown is displayed at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History (Photo: Getty Images) \nIn 1977, the country was in the grips of an oil crisis and in bad shape economically. Instead of a black-tie ball, President Carter hosted the \"people's inaugural parties,\" with a more affordable ticket price of $25. \nRosalynn’s gown therefore had to reflect the less formal atmosphere. Her solution was to recycle a coat and sleeveless blue chiffon gown with gold trim that she had worn when her husband became governor in 1971. \nThe move was meant as a canny political and social statement that sent out the message ‘this is not important to me, at a time when the country is in recession.’ But interestingly it backfired. The public felt that she wasn’t taking her role as First Lady seriously. Pat Nixon in Karen Stark for Harvey Berin, 1969 Inaugural gown worn by first lady Pat Nixon for the 1969 inauguration (Photo: Getty Image) \nIn the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King, rioting and widespread opposition to the Vietnam war, the Nixon administration offered to restore law and order, peace and stability. \nPat Nixon opted for a bright yellow gown embroidered with gold and silver and encrusted with Austrian crystals. Not only is yellow cheerful and sunny, it’s neutral in terms of political parties, and it’s also perceived as a unifying colour. Lady Bird Johnson in John Moore, 1963 Yellow satin gown and sable-trimmed coat designed by John Moore (Photo: Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History) \nLady Bird Johnson probably had one of the most difficult tasks facing any American First Lady. The country was still healing after the assassination of JFK, and for the Johnsons, the event was bitter sweet. \nLady Bird Johnson saw her role as conveying hope, and her choice of yellow was cleverly selected to symbolise optimism. Her decision to wear John Moore, who was relatively unknown, also made a statement in itself. Jackie Kennedy in Ethan Frankau, 1961 President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy attend the inaugural ball January 20, 1961 (Photo: Getty) \nJackie Kennedy took the importance of image to a whole new level. Already widely recognised as one of the most fashionable ladies in political society, at the age of 32, she was also one of the youngest First Ladies in recent history. \nHer decision to design her own outfit, with the help of Bergdorf’s Ethan Frankou, was a master stroke. Not only did this demonstrate her maturity and fashion prowess, it also showed the extent of her control over her public image. \nThe off-white, sleeveless, silk chiffon gown was embroidered with silver thread, and had an accompanying cape, and was deemed a huge success. \nAs one of the first First Ladies to be televised, she took this into consideration when designing her gown, by choosing pale colors that would look good in black-and-white and she ensured her look was slightly unconventional and could be picked out in the crowd. \nJackie was very astute, keeping a close eye on high fashion and what the ladies in Paris were wearing. A departure from the look in American at the time, she looked expensive, accomplished and modern. \nShe knew exactly how she wanted to present herself, and continued to so masterfully throughout the Kennedy administration. The whole world fell in love with Jackie.

Mamie Eisenhower’s gown reflected this and no expense was spared. \nThe sparkling light pink peau de soie gown gown boasted 2,000 embroidered rhinestones, and had her name printed on the left instep of her Delman shoes. Her jeweled purse was encrusted with 3,456 pink pearls. \nResonating with the American public is also influenced popular fashin and is said to be the reason why the bubble-gum colour dominated the 1950s. \nThe message - let the good times roll. Elizabeth Truman 1949 (Photo: ALAMY) \nOfficial inauguration balls were not reinstated until the second inauguration of Harry S Truman in 1949. \nThrust was thrust into office in 1945 when Roosevelt died he was charged with ending a world war. An intensely private person, Bess believed that a lady should appear in the papers only three times in her life, her birth, her marriage and her death. \nThere is only one photograph of her, wearing a black velvet gown, which would have reflected the sombre mood at the time. However, a different gown was later donated to the Smithsonian First Lady Inaugural gowns collection. It remains a mystery. Eleanor Roosevelt in Arnold Constable, 1945 (Photo: Getty Images) \nNot yet subject to term limits, Eleanor's husband Franklin Roosevelt was elected as Commander-in-Chief in 1933, 1937, 1941 and 1945. \nAlthough inauguration balls had not officially been reinstated, Eleanor had to find gowns for more inaugurations than any other first lady in American history, despite the fact she wasn’t very interested in fashion. \nEleanor Roosevelt wore this pink rayon crepe gown trimmed with lace and sequins to the 1945 inaugural reception. It was to be her last inaugural celebration. Eleanor Roosevelt in Arnold Constable, 1941 (Photo: Getty) \nIn 1941 LIFE Magazine wrote, \"To anyone fonder of clothes, her unprecedented chore might be a welcome one, but Mrs. Roosevelt cares scarcely more for sartorial nuances than Queen Mother Mary of England.” \nDespite that her rose white satin gown decorated with seed pearls was a huge success and seen as the height of fashion thanks to it's 'new 1941 fluid shoulders' with petal sleeves and sweeping train. Eleanor Roosevelt in Sally Milgrim, 1937 (Photo: Getty Images) \nIn 1937 Eleanor turned to Sally Milgrim to design her inauguration gown. The simple dress with a gathered scooped neckline also had an elegant train. \nThe reluctant style queen had a huge influence fashion and women looked to her to see what she was wearing. Eleanor Roosevelt in Sally Milgrim, 1933 Slate-blue silk crepe evening gown designed by Sally Milgrim for the 1933 inaugural ball (Photo: Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History) \nDespite her apparent disinterest in fashion Eleanor's slate-blue silk crepe gown in 1933 with a gold leaf-and-flower pattern was a big success. \nDesigned by Sally Milgrim, the colour was dubbed \"Eleanor blue” and it was reminiscent of the gowns films stars of the time would have worn. Lou Hoover, 1929 \nAt the start of the Great Depression private parties known as 'charity balls' were held during Herbert Hoover's inauguration, but Mr and Mrs Hoover didn't attend. It really did rain on poor old Lou's parade, she only got to ride in a public procession in a horse and cart, and got drenched. Grace Coolidge, 1923 \nSimilarly, Calvin Coolidge only held private parties during his second inauguration, depriving wife Grace of her big moment. On inauguration day Grace Coolidge wore a flapper-style evening dress made of velvet-trimmed black-and-gold metallic lace over a gold lamé underdress. Florence Harding, 1921 \nIn 1921, Florence Harding's husband Warren G Harding wanted to set an example of thrift and simplicity, and also opted to end the custom of inaugural balls. Edith Wilson, 1913 \nSadly Edith Wilson 's husband Woodrow shared the view that inaugural balls were too expensive and 'unnecessary for the solemn occasion', so she never get to the belle of the ball either. Lady Helen Taft 1909 (Photo: Courtesy of Library of Congress) \nLady Helen Taft, however, did have her moment to shine. Elegant in white chiffon embroidered with gold, she set a high standard for future first ladies to follow. \nLady Helen - known as Nellie - was to have a stroke just two months after the inauguration. But she fought back to health and resumed her role as an accomplished hostess who was very engaged in politics.
