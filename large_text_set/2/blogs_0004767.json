With his wife working and an infant at home, Brian had to go to particularly extreme lengths in order to watch the game. \n“About 45 minutes before the game started my screen froze, so I did the basic thing that you do, restart the box to get the thing back up,” Brian said. “And, so, it didn’t work and I called my provider, and sure enough, they told me that the cable wouldn’t be back on until about 10:30 and I pretty much lost it on them. I told them that I wanted all my fees waived for the rest of the year. I was just losing it.” \n“My wife is working — we have an infant — so I couldn’t go to a bar,” he said. \n“So I basically just scooped up my baby and I drove down to Southern Maryland to go to my parents’ house who have nubbs non-HD TV.” \n“Oh my God,” said one Junkies host, Jason Bishop. \n“By the way, does that mean you had no internet, too?” Eric Bickel, another host, asked. \n“No internet. Because if I had internet, then I could have just streamed it on my phone,” Brian said. “The internet and my cable provider are the same thing.” \nAccording to DownDetector.com , Comcast received 1,723 reports of cable outages in the D.C. area between the hours of 4 p.m. and 11 p.m., a window which covers the duration of the Super Bowl. \nThe Super Bowl ended around 10:30 p.m. By the time Brian returned home, around midnight, he was still without cable service, he says. \nFollow @ChrisLingebach and @1067TheFan on Twitter.
