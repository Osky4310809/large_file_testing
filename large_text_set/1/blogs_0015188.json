See video below: \nOn Wednesday, a military commander with West Africa’s regional bloc, Seydou Maiga Mboro said its forces will “take action” at midnight unless a solution is found to Gambia’s political crisis before then. According to him, all the troops are already in place awaiting the deadline for President Yahya Jammeh to step down. \nSenegalese and Nigerian troops have arrived the borders of the Gambia awaiting instructions to oust Jammeh out of office if he refuses to step down after clinging to power for over 22 years despite losing to Adama Barrow. \nHowever, Barrow on his social media account invited everyone to his inauguration which according to him will hold at the Gambian embassy in Dakar, Senegal. \n\n— Adama Barrow (@BarrowOfficial1) January 19, 2017 \nBefore running for the Presidency of his country, Barrow lived in the United Kingdom (UK) for several years, where he reportedly worked as a security guard at the Argos catalogue store in north London, while studying for his real estate qualifications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T14:19:28.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
