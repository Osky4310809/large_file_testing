Kim was tied-up at gunpoint and robbed by five armed men while relaxing at the family’s Paris residence. The masked men stole a jewelry box containing items worth over $6.7 million.\nKim and the rest of the family flew home to the United States almost immediately, and, until now, kept silent about what happened. That changed when last week a teaser for Keeping Up With The Kardashians showed Kim revealing details about the heist.\nThe full episode aired last night (you can see the trailer above,) shortly after Kim took to Twitter to explain why she has decided to talk about it now.\nTonight's episode is going to be very tough for me.\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 19, 2017 \n\nHowever, I thought it was important to share this story through my eyes & not in an interview where my own words could be twisted.\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 19, 2017 \n\nI have always shared so much & I'm not going to hold back when this was probably one of the most life changing experiences for me.\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 19, 2017 \n\nI would never wish this experience upon anyone,but have learned some valuable lessons &feel so blessed to be safe home w my babies & husband\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 19, 2017 \n\nTo my friends, family, and loved ones I can't thank you enough for being there when I needed you the most.\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 19, 2017 \n\nTo the French police, thank you for your incredible hard work.\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 19, 2017 \n\nI took a tragic horrific experience and did not let it diminish me, rather grew and evolved and allowed the experience to teach me.\n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 20, 2017 \n\nI can say I've become so much better because of it….thank you for allowing me to share my story tonight #KUWTK \n— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 20, 2017 \n\nIn the episode, Kardashian says she thought she was going to be raped and killed. “Then [one of the armed men] duct tapes my face, my mouth, to get me to not yell or anything and then he grabs my legs and I wasn’t, I had no clothes on under [my robe] and he pulled me towards him at the front of the bed and I thought, ‘okay, this is the moment. They are going to rape me.'” Kardashian tearfully recalled. “And I fully mentally prepped myself and then he didn’t and he duct taped my legs together.”\n“Then they had the gun up to me and I just knew that was the moment they are just totally going to shoot me in the head,” she continued. “I just prayed Kourtney [Kardashian] was going to have a normal life after she sees my dead body on the bed.”\nWatch the trailer above, then head over to E! to watch the full episode. \nIn other news, even Selena Gomez is sick of Instagram .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T10:58:55.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
