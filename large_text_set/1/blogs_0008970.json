Both parties left the scene. \nA man called police and paramedics from his Irvine home and was treated for undisclosed injuries, Latosquin said. \n“It’s very early on in the investigation, so we’re not releasing much information about this incident just yet,” Latosquin said, “... but we’ll be releasing more over the next few hours.” \nA SigAlert was issued for the two right lanes of the northbound 241, from just north of Los Alisos to Portola Parkway -- about a mile -- at around 7 p.m. as investigators worked to preserve the crime scene and scour the area for evidence, Latosquin said. No traffic delays were reported. \nThe SigAlert would be in effect until further notice. \nOfficers did not believe there was an immediate safety threat to residents in the area. \nAnyone with information about this incident can submit anonymous tips to Orange County Crime Stoppers at 855-TIP-OCCS (855-847-6227). \nContact the writer: 714-796-7802 or", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T07:51:25.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
