I’m a nervous flyer, so anything that makes me feel more comfortable is a good thing!’. \nthe color of the seat cover shifts from dark blue towards lighter tones at the center of the cabin \n\n\na metallic silver and blue foil is utilized within the cabin, whose color shifts reflect natural light, adding warmth to the design. another aspect of the interiors is the brand panel, an intervention that sees the lufthansa logo framed on an airfoil shaped surface. the panel’s soft surface exists in contrast to the crisp logo, and is backlit to give the impression that the panel is not in contact with the wall. \nthe interiors are based on a color scheme that is designed to resemble the sky and the horizon \n\n\n‘ travel nowadays is no longer a matter of arriving to the chosen destination ,’ says the design team. ‘changes in our living and working patterns have altered the motives of travel from strictly work or rest to an interplay between work, culture, development, adventure, rest, play, where the overall experience is stronger than traveling’s main purpose. within this context, flying becomes an emotional part of the journey which addresses travelers on a personal level. ’ \nthe lufthansa logo is framed on an airfoil shaped panel \n\n\n‘ the values of industrial quality and service, which lufthansa is renowned for, were mixed with a more tactile and personal human aesthetic through the individual and ever varying seat textiles ,’ adds pearsonlloyd . ‘this introduced a new energy and created a narrative, which unravels from the traveler’s first entry to the cabin to the discovery of the seat details and the depth of the textiles.’ \nthe scheme places an emphasis on craft and textiles \nthe design team considered which parts of the body will come into contact with which materials \na range of options and combinations were explored \nthe design draws inspiration from a modified lufthansa blue \nSave", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:57:12.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
