But some of them that have commenced operations are complaining of low patronage. \nThe National Automotive Industry Development Plan, according to the government, is to generate employment, boost Gross Domestic Product, and promote the Small Medium and Enterprises in the sector as well as aid skills development and transfer of technology. \nCopyright PUNCH.
