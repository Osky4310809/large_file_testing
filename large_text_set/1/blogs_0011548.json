For example, here's one-percenter Patton Oswalt, who I'll assume is tweeting from an in-home hyperbaric chamber:\nAnd just like that, Trump isn't funny anymore. That press conference was...terrifying. We're fucked. Go be with your families. Hoard food.\n— Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) January 11, 2017\nOswalt presumably wasn't so frightened back in 2009, the first year of President Barack Obama's administration. Yet back then, Obama's Communications Director Anita Dunn gave an interview to the New York Times during which she proclaimed Obama's administration had adopted as policy that Fox News was fake news.\nDid the New York Times fear freedom of the press had been eradicated? No, the headline was simply that \" Fox's Volley With Obama \" was ... \" Intensifying .\"\nIronically, current CNN host and Trump critic Brian Stelter wrote the article .\nIt begins:\nAttacking the news media is a time-honored White House tactic but to an unusual degree, the Obama administration has narrowed its sights to one specific organization, the Fox News Channel, calling it, in essence, part of the political opposition.\n“ We’re going to treat them the way we would treat an opponent ,” said Anita Dunn, the White House communications director, in a telephone interview on Sunday. “As they are undertaking a war against Barack Obama and the White House, we don’t need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave .”\nIn 2009, the White House's position on Fox News was that it was \"an opponent,\" at \"war(!)\" with the White House. And that they were not, in fact, a legitimate news organization.\nThey were to be treated as fake news. It was White House policy.\nHere's Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post :\nThe open punishment of news organizations who report things Donald Trump doesn't like is a dangerous prececent\n— Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) January 11, 2017\nAny citizen of this country should be worried about this exchange https://t.co/0eoCgKCH71\n— Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) January 11, 2017\nJohn Harwood of NBC:\nTrump, at news conference ripping press, on his attitude toward First Amendment: \"great respect for freedom of the press, and all of that\"\n— John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) January 11, 2017\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/11/obamas-white-house-2009-dont-pretend-fox-news-is-a-legitimate-news-organization/\nload more View as single page", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TheFix/status/819231193409474565", "https://twitter.com/JohnJHarwood/status/819288022260793349", "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per", "https://twitter.com/pattonoswalt/status/819238137989738496", "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/business/media/12fox.html", "https://t.co/0eoCgKCH71", "https://twitter.com/TheFix/status/819229736039747584"], "published": "2017-01-11T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T01:03:28.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
