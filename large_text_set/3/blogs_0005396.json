Reuters \n\"As people suffering from cataract can see only after undergoing a surgery, these leaders can see things only when they see votes,\" Modi said at a public meeting in his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi after a roadshow here. \nAccusing the SP government of \"bias\" in its welfare programmes, he said it believed in 'kuchh ka saath, kuchh ka vikas' (support of a few, development of a few) while he believed in everybody's development as in 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'. \n\"The SP and the BSP are two sides of the same coin, the former being A (Akhilesh) SP and B (Bahujan) SP,\" Modi said. \nHe also said that Akhilesh and Rahul were \"delicate\" people incapable of taking hard decisions, while pitching himself as a grassroots leader who can develop the state. \nTaking potshots at the Congress over its run of losses in the recent polls, he said one day, research would be done to find out if it once existed, as it is \"disappearing from everywhere.\" \nWhile Akhilesh has inherited his political powers from his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, Rahul has got it from \"so many of his forefathers\", Modi said while using a local term, 'ghelua' (what comes free of cost) for the two leaders. \n\"They are such delicate people who cannot take hard decisions. They think what if they lose what they got. I have not got anything in inheritance. Whatever I have got is due to the blessings of the people of Kashi. I can take hard decisions to rid the country of its problems. I have the courage to do so,\" the Prime Minister said. \nDemonetisation, he said, has brought the SP, BSP and the Congress on the same side in its opposition while the entire country had supported it. \nReaching out to small traders who are in significant numbers here, he said they would not be touched by his government's drive against corruption as the politicians and 'babus' have looted the country all these years. \nForty seats will go to the polls on 8 March, bringing an end to an almost a month long seven-phase elections. Counting of votes is scheduled on 11 March. \nProjecting himself as a \"son of the soil\" who has seen difficult days, Modi said he has the capability to take hard decisions. He spoke at length about demonetisation and surgical strikes as he hit out at opposition parties for seeking proof of the army's action. \nHis rivals, he said, take decisions in power keeping the interests of some sections of society in mind to win elections while he was working for everybody's development. \nHe also referred to his road show earlier in the day which he said broke previous day's record and the support he received was something he had never seen in his life. \nModi as well Yadav and Gandhi had led road shows on Sunday, both of which had drawn a massive response. \nAttacking the Congress, he said during the UPA government media reports were full of scams and how much of money was lost, while now his rivals were asking how much of money he has brought back. \n\"Those who have looted the country for the last 70 years will have to return the poor's money. I will do that,\" Modi said. \nThe Prime Minister also cited a number of developmental works he had undertaken to develop the holy city, where the BJP is locked in a keen fight the SP-Congress and the BSP candidates. \nIf the eastern UP is developed properly, the state can lead India's development, which is not possible without its progress, he said in his hour-long speech. \n 38  38 am Also See", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:22:47.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
