Sutton goalkeeper may have broken FA betting rules by eating pie \nThe 46-year-old reserve goalkeeper caught the attentions of the cameras when, after manager Paul Doswell made all three substitutions, he tucked into a pie while standing in the dug-out. The incident caused great laughter both at the ground and on social media, but it quickly transpired that Shaw appeared to have an ulterior motive. \nBefore the match, Sun Bet tweeted an offer of 8/1 odds on Shaw to be pictured eating a pie during the match, and the fact that the same betting company had taken out a one-off shirt sponsor for the match was not lost on critics who felt the publicity stunt overshadowed the match. \nWorse was to follow though. Shaw confirmed that he knew about the offer, which raises the prospect of a Football Association investigation into a possible breach of betting rules. The saga hasn’t painted Sutton in the best light, with both the chairman, Bruce Elliott, and manager Doswell speaking out against his actions.
