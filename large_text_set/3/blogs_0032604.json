Posted on Mar 29, 2017 @ 16:40PM \nTeen Mom 3 alum Mackenzie McKee claims former cast mate Briana DeJesus was picked over her to join Teen Mom 2 — and she’s NOT happy with MTV’s decision. \n“They interviewed me and Bri two months ago, but chose her,” McKee, 22, told RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview. “I thought, ‘This can’t be true!’ I was confused.” \nMcKee, who remains married to Josh , the father of her three children, despite a cheating scandal , believes her massive social media following better qualified her for the very public new gig. (The personal trainer has 617,000 Instagram followers to DeJesus’ 87,000.) \n“I think the amount of following difference is shocking,” she continued. “I’ve been consistent with followers.” \nPHOTOS: Betrayal!

And here she is on Teen Mom!” \nIn addition, the fitness buff argued, she is working on multiple projects, making her the ideal reality candidate. \n“I have worked very hard for where I am. I’m working on all this stuff and what has she done? She’s not working on anything,” she huffed. “It sucks the one who has been working harder didn’t get it.” \n“I hope MTV didn’t chose her over me because I am married and have three kids with the same guy,” McKee continued. (DeJesus, the 22-year-old mom of Nova , 5, is expecting her second child with a mystery father.) “The story on different baby daddies is what people are interested in.” \nPHOTOS: Inside ‘Teen Mom OG’s Nastiest Feuds EVER \nDespite McKee’s objections, DeJesus reportedly already started filming scenes for the next season of the MTV hit , which will likely air next year. \nWe pay for juicy info!
