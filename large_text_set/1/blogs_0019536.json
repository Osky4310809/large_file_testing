Shantanu seemed to be the audiences' favourite, but it was Teriya who won more votes and took home the trophy. \nAll these years JDJ was all about the journey of a non-dancer turning into a dancer. This season was an exception. All the three final contestants were professional dancers. Teriya has won dance competitions in the past, such as Dance India Dance Li'l Masters in 2014. Contestant Salman became the first runner-up, while Shantanu was a close second. \nCongratulations, Teriya!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T12:33:16.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
