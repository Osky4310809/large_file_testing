Every year since the wars began, a service member or the families of those killed in war, known as Gold Star families, have sat with the First Family during the State of the Union.\nBut Tuesday’s tribute in the House chamber was different. For some observers, it was the moment the presidential became “presidential.” Shortly after the address Van Jones, a former Obama White House official and CNN commentator, declared on CNN , for example: “He became President of the United States in that moment. Period.”\nBut for the military it was the latest reversal on the president’s ownership of the raid. Earlier Tuesday, he put the blame at the feet of the military generals in an interview with Fox and Friends, saying: “They lost Ryan.”\nBy evening, Trump called the mission a success that yielded a lot intelligence.\n“His ownership lasts as long as it’s politically expedient,” an Army commander observed.\nEven the Owens’ family seems divided about how to engage with the commander-in-chief who signed the order for the raid. Just days earlier, Owens’ father told the Miami Herald that he refused to meet with Trump when the president traveled to Dover Air Force base to meet Chief Owens as his remains returned to the United States. And he pleaded to keep politics out of finding out the truth about the raid.\n“Don’t hide behind my son’s death,” William Owens said in that interview, which was published Sunday.\nThe use of family members in political events perhaps hits a particularly raw nerve at the Pentagon because so many that serve there have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and talked to their families about what to do should they die. For them, such dilemmas are not hypothetical. And most troops serving at the Pentagon have lost a comrade or met with a widow to describe her loved one’s final moments. Some troops have been assigned funeral duty, in which they were part a ceremony for either a war veteran or a recent combat death.\nTrump has not always embraced Gold Star families. Over the summer, he disparaged another Gold Star family, the parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, after they spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Trump questioned why Capt. Khan’s mother, Ghazala, was so quiet as her husband, Khizr, spoke at the convention, suggesting that her Muslim faith prohibited her from speaking. And he repeatedly attacked the Khan family in the weeks afterward on Twitter .\nTo be sure, not everyone in the military felt the same way. And even some who were upset about Tuesday’s events were sympathetic to Trump.\n“Trump doesn’t have much familiarity with the military,” the Army commander explained. “He will learn.”", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/03/01/donald-trump-congress-address-navy-seal-widow-van-jones-bts.cnn/video/playlists/reaction-to-trumps-address/", "http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article135064074.html", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/760070280932982784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2017-03-02T08:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T01:30:20.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
