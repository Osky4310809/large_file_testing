Spanning 90,000 km in one of the biggest 100G deployments in the world, the Nokia transport network allows Jio to offer innovative, high-capacity services to underserved regions in India as well as a nationwide long-distance (NLD) service. \nReliance Jio deployed Nokia’s high-capacity transport network to offer high-bandwidth services such as video streaming, multimedia content distribution and cloud and business services to its rapidly increasing subscriber base. The company has deployed Nokia’s 1830 Photonic Service Switch including 100G Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) capabilities enhanced with Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) intelligence to support capacity management and restoration. The new transport network supports the rapid deployment of new services as network demand increases. \nJyotindra Thacker, President at Reliance Jio said, \nIn only 170 days, Jio has signed on 100 million new users. With growth rates of this magnitude we had to ensure we deployed the highest capacity, most resilient transport network to build out the 4G network. Nokia’s next-generation DWDM portfolio provides the ability to scale easily as Jio continues to expand the network to reach the underserved areas of India with digital services in key areas such as communication, education, healthcare, payments and multi-media entertainment. \nSam Bucci, head of Nokia’s Optical Business said, \nThe government’s vision for digitization across the country, combined with Jio’s goal of making broadband a basic service for all citizens, means broadband penetration will grow quickly in India. The Nokia solution not only provides the speed and capacity necessary for this growth, but it also ensures a more reliable service for the customers. This deployment strengthens Nokia’s presence in India’s optical market where our foothold spans from metro to backbone networks.
