Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 \nThe BuzzFeed story came out even as the Senate Intelligence Committee continued to investigate allegations , based on an unclassified intelligence report released on Friday, that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin had ordered a propaganda campaign to help Trump and hurt Clinton during the election. \nFBI Director James Comey demurred on commenting about whether the FBI has investigated alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians connected to the Putin regime. \nThe mere existence of these reports cast doubts on the president-elect’s ability to guide American foreign policy against a hostile power, Russia. There have been numerous previous connections regarding Trump that have prompted concern, including Trump’s kind words toward Putin, his open encouraging of Russia to hack Clinton’s emails, his hiring of aides with connections to the Putin regime (like Michael Flynn as national security adviser and Rex Tillerson as secretary of state), and his scrubbing of a plank from the Republican platform that was harsh on Russia for invading Ukraine. \nMatthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
