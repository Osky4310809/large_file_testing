By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 24, 2017 4:40 PM Kansas shooting: Ian Grillot said stopping the gunman was an instinct and he wasn’t thinking about anything else at that moment. (Source: screenshot) \nKansas shooting: In the aftermath of Kansas shooting on two Indian techies, 32-year-old Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani in a racial attack at a bar in Olathe, Kansas, while everyone else was busy in bashing Americans for being racist and intolerant, 24-year-old Ian Grillot scripted a new definition of humanity. Grillot, who was present at the bar during the carnage, attempted to chase down and subdue the assailant, hoping to keep him down and disarmed until the police arrived. However, the accused shot him with 3 bullets after which Grillot had to be rushed to the hospital. \nGrillot was at the bar watching a basketball match with his friends when he heard the gunshots from the outside. At that point, the young lad miscounted the number of shots to 9 and thought that assailant must have run out of bullets. So, he tried to chase him down but the 51-year-old, Navy veteran, Adam W. Purinton, who has been arrested by the police now, turned and shot Grillot in the arm and later, sent two more bullets through his chest. \nHere is what Ian Grillot had to say about the incident: \nWhile speaking to KCTV5 News, he said stopping the gunman was an instinct and wasn’t thinking about anything else at that moment. Even though he is grateful that he survives, he regrets that only one of the two Indians could be saved in the attack. \nThe accused has been charged with premeditated first-degree murder and his bond has been set at USD 2 million. According to Garmin, Kuchibhotla and Madasani worked in the company’s aviation systems. “We’re saddened that two Garmin associates were involved in last night’s (Wednesday night) incident, and we express our condolences to the family and friends of our co-workers involved. Garmin will have grievance counsellors on-site and available for its associates today and tomorrow,” Garmin said in a statement. The alleged hate crime has sent shocked waves among Indian-American and the Indian community across the United States.
