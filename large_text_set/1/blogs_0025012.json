Neither man was known to the police prior to the shooting, which killed six and injured dozens. \nThere is no word of a motive as of yet and charges have not been filed. The men were allegedly armed with an AK-47 and at least one of them spoke with a \"Quebecois accent.\" \nAccording to Fox News , one of the suspects is of Moroccan origin and the pair are believed to be students at Université Laval, a school in Quebec City. One of the gunmen turned himself in with a 911 call and gave up his location. \nThe people killed in the attack were of north African descent. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement condemning the attack and saying that Muslim-Canadians are \"an important part of our national fabric.\" He has not yet commented now that it has been revealed that at least one of the suspects appears to have a Muslim background. \n“It was with tremendous shock, sadness and anger that I heard of this evening’s tragic and fatal shooting at the Centre culturel islamique de Québec located in the Ste-Foy neighbourhood of the city of Québec. \n“We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge. \n“On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of all those who have died, and we wish a speedy recovery to those who have been injured. \n“While authorities are still investigating and details continue to be confirmed, it is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. \n“Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country. Canadian law enforcement agencies will protect the rights of all Canadians, and will make every effort to apprehend the perpetrators of this act and all acts of intolerance. \n“Tonight, we grieve with the people of Ste-Foy and all Canadians.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T18:04:48.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
