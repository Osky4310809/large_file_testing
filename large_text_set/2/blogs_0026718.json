This is a smartphone that follows in the footsteps of many flagship smartphones by employing the use of a dual real camera setup. Although, unlike those flagship options, the UMIDIGI Z Pro is designed to be priced significantly cheaper. Which means if you are after a smartphone which comes with a flagship-like rear dual camera experience, then the UMIDIGI Z Pro could be the smartphone to go for. \nThe rear dual camera setup comprises of two 13-megapixel cameras (Sony IMX258 sensors). With this being a dual camera configuration, you can expect one of the cameras to hone in on monochrome, while the other focuses more on the RGB side of things. A design which should ensure that whether you are looking to take color or black and white images, the UMIDIGI Z Pro will be able to deliver crisp, detailed, and vivid images. UMIDIGI points out that as the UMIDIGI Z Pro comes running on a MediaTek processor, it is the first MediaTek-powered smartphone to come with such a setup. A setup which does mean that in terms of its camera abilities, the UMIDIGI Z Pro is significantly more camera-focused than any other MediaTek-powered smartphone on the market. \nIn addition to actually announcing the UMIDIGI Z PRO, UMIDIGI has also confirmed that the UMIDIGI Z Pro will become available to pre-order on March 9. Ahead of that pre-order availability, UMIDIGI is now accepting pre-sale requests. Which means if you do sign up with an email address so you can be one of the first to be able to pre-order the UMIDIGI Z Pro, then UMIDIGI will provide you with a $50 discount code which can be used against the UMIDIGI Z Pro pre-order on March 9. The same product page is also running a contest where you could win the UMIDIGI Z Pro for free.
