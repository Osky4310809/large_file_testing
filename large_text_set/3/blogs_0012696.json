CHAOS: One of the scenes of the crisis in Ile-Ife. \nThe call was made following the recent crisis at Ile Ife, where Hausas, who have been living there for ages clashed with their hosts. The crisis left heavy casualties on both sides. \nAt the emergency peace meeting which held at the palace of Seriki Shasha in Ibadan, the leaders of Hausa communities were directed to go back to their respective states of origin and ensure peace reigns there so that Yoruba living there will enjoy peaceful existence. \nAlhaji Maiyasin said at the meeting: “I convened this peace meeting over the clash that occurred at Ile-Ife between Yoruba and Hausa-Fulani recently. The reason I called the meeting is to let all of us come together and brainstorm on how to ensure that the cordial relationship and harmony among Yoruba and Arewa community would not be disrupted. \nWondering why the Ife crisis erupted, he added;”The two tribes have inter-married and we have done so many good things together. We should not allow the clash to disrupt the peace in the land. The Yoruba are not against the Hausa or Fulani. We should take what happened in good faith.” \nThe representative of Governor Aregbesola, who is his Senior Special Assistant on Arewa Matters, Muhammed Bashir Hussein said; Yoruba are not hostile to the Hausa because during the fierce Ife-Modakeke war that claimed many lives, no Hausa or Fulani died. \n“Over the decades, there was no conflict between the entire Hausa-Fulani and the Yoruba nation. We all have similar ideas in culture, dressing, religion, mutual understanding, good relationship and we are brotherly and maritally close. \n“We should not allow the intruders to destroy our cordial relationship and the peace, harmony and tranquillity that we are enjoying among ourselves. If there is any intruder among the Hausa, they should not keep them. We should fish them out. Hausa are easy going and Yoruba too are peace loving. We should live together in peace.” \nWhile commending the step taken so far by Governor Aregbesola, he said the umbilical cord of love that binds them together must not snap adding that the force headquarters in Abuja had deployed a team to investigate the impasse. \nThe Olowu of Kuta Kingdom, and Chairman, Council of Owu Obas, Oba Hammed Adekunle Oyelude Tegbosun III, restated that nothing would taint the cordiality between the two ethnic groups.
