However, our repeated warnings have not prevented this happening. \n\"I don’t think he was just caught up in the heat of the moment. Instead, it’s a flagrant violation of the club management.\" \nShanghai Shenhua are currently fourth in the CSL table after two matches having drawn 1-1 with Tianjin Quanjian in the game that saw Sheng dismissed, with Witsel scoring the late equaliser.
