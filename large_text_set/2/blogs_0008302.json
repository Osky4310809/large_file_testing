Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWith the NHS collapsing around her ears, brazen Theresa May has insisted the Tories had lavished record sums of cash on the service. \nBut figures unearthed by the Mirror shatter that claim as they show spending is growing at the slowest rate since records began in 1955 – and it is likely to stay that way until the end of the decade. \nMillions of patients are suffering the longest ever waits for casualty care, beds, cancer treatment and operations. \nAnd experts the blame Government NHS spending, which now stands at a measly annual growth rate of 1.1%. \nIndependent economic forecaster the IFS, which provided the figures, said the shocking funding crisis gripping the NHS means it will be unable to cope with our population growth and ageing population.

Every day we see an NHS pushed to the brink because of Tory underfunding. \n“These are some of the worst figures we have seen. Experts are saying ­standards are being pushed back 15 years or more. “ Labour are calling for Theresa May to get a grip (Photo: Getty) \nThis can’t carry on. Theresa May needs to get a grip, give the NHS the ­investment it needs. \n“Behind each of these statistics is a patient suffering. It’s making Theresa May’s utter disregard for the dire state of the NHS all the more disgraceful.” \nBritish Medical ­Association chair Dr Mark Porter added: “The ­Government has failed to grasp the seriousness of the ­situation. \n\"The Prime Minister cannot continue to bury her head in the sand as care worsens.” \nThe IFS report said: “The period between 2009/10 and 2014/15 saw ­historically slow increases in public spending on health, averaging 1.1% a year. \n“This was the lowest five-year growth rate since a consistent time series of health spending began in 1955/56.” This rate of growth is even smaller than the last Tory government between 1979 and 1997 under Margaret Thatcher and John Major (Photo: Getty) \nThis rate of growth is even smaller than the last Tory government between 1979 and 1997 under Margaret Thatcher and John Major - when the rate averaged 3.4%. \nLabour PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown oversaw growth of 5.9%. \nSeparate figures leaked to the BBC showed record numbers of patients, at least 780, spent more than four hours waiting in A&E in January. \nOnly 82% were ­transferred, admitted or discharged within that time. The target is 95%. It appeared to be the worst month in the past 13 years. \nThe figures also suggest record numbers of people, more than 60,000, waited longer than 12 hours for a bed once seen. \nLabour MP Heidi Alexander, who sits on the Commons Health Committee, said: \"We just can't go on as we are. We have got more people waiting for hours to be seen in A&E, more people waiting longer for important operations, and more people stuck in hospital when they're well enough to go home. \n\"Simon Stevens at the Public Accounts Committee in January was quite open about the fact that spending per head of the population is going to go down next year, and at the very least funding has to keep up with demand. \n\"We've got about 5million more people living in the UK over the last 10 years and more of those people are older. The number of people over the age of 85 is expected to roughly double over the next 20 years. \n\"So we have to find a solution to this and I just think the government have put their head in the sand about it.\" \nNew data shows 2,593 people waited more than 12 hours to be admitted in 2016 – the highest ever and more than double the 1,206 in the previous year. A record number of people are waiting to be treated (Photo: Getty) \nDelays to cancer treatment are also causing more people to suffer anxiety and depression. In 2016, 25,157 waited for more than two months, another sickening and unwelcome record. \nMacmillan Cancer Support’s Dr Fran Woodard said: “This is a stark warning sign that services are struggling to keep up with demand. These pressures will only become more acute as the numbers of people diagnosed increases.” \nThe number of patients blocking beds due to lack of social care was also the highest on record last year. \nDr Chris Moulton, vice-president of The Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “We simply do not have any more room to put patients. \n“We have the lowest number of acute beds per capita in Europe. As a result, bed occupancy is at dangerous levels and exit block is putting lives at risk.” \nNHS Providers, which represents ­hospitals, has called for an urgent review of winter pressures on the health service. How the UK compares to Europe UK population aged 65 and over The health spending slowdown NHS Spending 2015-16 \nChief executive Chris Hopson said: “NHS staff have responded magnificently to increased winter pressures, but the situation has become unsustainable. \n“The rise in long trolley waits is ­particularly worrying, as there is evidence they can lead to worse outcomes for patients.” \nOther figures showed almost three-quarters of hospitals have had patients wait for more than 100 days to be discharged – even though fit to leave. \nDespite the ­overwhelming evidence the NHS is at breaking point, arrogant Mrs May kept up the pretence that all was well under the Tories. \nShe said: “We have put record funding into the National Health Service. I recognise it is under pressure, that’s why we will be putting the £10billion extra in. \n“We are seeing something like 3,000 more people being seen within the four-hour standard every day in the NHS.” \nThe UK forks out less on health than other EU countries. In 2014, the latest figures which are available, total health spending accounted for 9.9% of GDP. \nBut the average in Europe was 10.3%, according to the Nuffield Trust. \nGermany spent 11% of GDP on health and France 11.1%.
