Wayne Rooney reminding the Everton fans what they're missing in his first game after leaving (Photo: John Peters/Manchester United/Getty) \nIt's great and all that, as in it does the job. \nAnd looks brilliant next to Rooney's little note: \"Would like to thank all the staff and teammates I have played with at Manchester United for helping me reach 250 goals. \n\"I couldn't have done it without you!\" The goal that made history (Photo: Man Utd via Getty) Where it all began (Photo: Getty) \nBut still, there's just something about it that will bring a little smirk to your face. \nMaybe it's the interesting choice of backing music? Maybe it's the zoom-in-zoom-out transitions applied to EVERY picture? Maybe it's the rather random choice of images? \nWho knows... but it is pretty funny.
