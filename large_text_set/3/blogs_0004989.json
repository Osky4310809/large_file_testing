While some predict and speculate an iPhone X, others say that Apple will stick to its regular cycle of two smartphones and introduce a new bigger-size category.\nJapanese news agency Nikkei had reported that the tenth year anniversary edition of the iPhone will feature a 5-inch OLED display, however, in a new report it has reiterated that the iPhone 8 will be the largest of the three new models that will be making an appearance this year.\nSo the new prediction says that the iPhone 8 will have a 5.8-inch OLED display, the iPhone 7s with a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 7s Plus with its usual 5.5-inch dimension. The regular upgrades will feature LCD panels like last year.\nNikkei’s new prediction around the iPhone now matches the ones that was put out by KGI Securities Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been known for quite some accurate leaks and speculations.\nIn a world where smartphones are growing, well at least display sizes, a larger iPhone makes perfect sense. And its nice to see Apple changing with the times. This year smartphone makers are expected to launch smartphones that have a large display but cut down on bezels making them fit better in the hand. Just look at the LG G6 and the leaked Samsung Galaxy S8.\nThe post Apple iPhone 8 to launch this year with a 5.8-inch display according to Japanese news agency Nikkei appeared first on Tech2 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T06:34:18.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
