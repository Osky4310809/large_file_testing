Subtle design changes mark it out from its predecessor, such as its slightly extended vamp and toe box for a lower profile, making it sit closer to the ground. Meanwhile, its cored-out outsole makes it super lightweight, while a “3.26” on the tongue nods to the first drop date: Air Max Day.\nWe paired the future classic with four people bringing it to Paris with their dedicated creative energy. As we know, when you’re a kid you’re told you can do anything. And it’s true. Your creative potential can take you anywhere. But we know that life doesn’t work like that. To know what you want to do is one thing, to have the chance to realize your creative self, to do it, and to do it well, is a completely different ball game.\nEach one – from rapper Ichon and beatmaking production partner Myth Syzer, to Applecore head Steven Alexis and FUTUR’s Benoit Frédonie – brings something different. From pure individuality, to commitment, to a defiant belief in that what you’re doing needs to be done, these aspects have led them to where they are now.\nKeeping the creative energy of Paris fresh, they styled the new Nike silhouette and we took the photos. Check the shots above, check out stores like Hanon and Solebox to cop the sneaker (y’know, if there’s any left or you’re heading to the forums), or read these guys’ stories about how to actually make it as a creative.\nBuy Now (For Men) Buy Now (For Women) More Info Highsnobiety and Nike are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Air Max 1 with an entire month of in-depth articles, personal stories and events leading up to Air Max Day 2017.
