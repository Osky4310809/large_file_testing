It is our belief that, as business leaders, you are uniquely positioned to take public stands against policy decisions that are economically destructive and morally wrong. The recent executive order pertaining to immigration is not only discriminatory, but also damaging to American competitiveness, productivity, growth, and innovation . Every day, we see the value of learning and working in a diverse and multicultural community that includes people from all around the world. Many of America’s most innovative and iconic companies — including forty percent of the Fortune 500 — were founded or led by immigrants and their children. The negative impact of these policies is already being felt on campuses and across business communities around the world . Hard-working people and their families are uncertain about their future and their ability to pursue the American dream. Our community is facing similar challenges. Students from affected countries and far beyond fear travelling outside American borders. We have a lot to lose by alienating all of these talented people; there are less destructive ways to solve for our security. The American spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship is now under threat . Let us send a clear message that America’s business community is fundamentally opposed to policies that threaten the core values we all share. Please join us and those who have already spoken-up in standing against discrimination. There is perhaps no more important time to use your voices to make a difference in this country and the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:46:50.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
