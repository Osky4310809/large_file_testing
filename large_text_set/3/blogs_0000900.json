He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional,” Trump said. \nMultiple outlets reported Wednesday that Sessions did not disclose meetings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the senate confirmation process. Sessions has since recused himself from any investigation into Russian interference with the presidential election, although top Democrats are still calling for his resignation. \n“This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand,” Trump said. “They lost the election and now, they have lost their grip on reality.” \nThe president added, “The real story is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. This is a total witch hunt!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:58:34.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
