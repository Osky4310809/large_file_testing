House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. walks to his office on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March 23, 2017. CREDIT: AP/J. Scott Applewhite Following days of frantic negotiations and last-minute tweaks to the House GOP’s proposed Obamacare replacement, multiple news outlets are reporting that Republican leadership has decided to push back a floor vote that had been originally scheduled for Thursday. The vote will now reportedly be held the following day.\nIt’s an embarrassing setback for House Republican leadership and President Donald Trump. Ryan failed to secure the needed votes even after agreeing to gut Obamacare’s essential health benefits requirement — which mandates coverage for maternity care, emergency services, and substance abuse treatment — in order to accommodate far-right conservatives.\nAs a result of that concession, several moderate Republicans quickly announced they would defect and vote against the bill. Many far-right conservatives also planned to vote against the bill, which they said was still too similar to Obamacare.\nIf the Republican bill known as the Affordable Health Care for America Act becomes law, 24 million fewer people will be uninsured by 2026 according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. There would also be a reduction of $880 billion in federal outlays for Medicaid.\nPaul Ryan adds useless and cruel work requirements to Medicaid \nBut these numbers may not be up to date due to a serious of last-minute changes Republicans made to the legislation before the House vote. Republicans refused to wait for another CBO score of its bill after adding further Medicaid cuts, an incentive to impose work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, and an earlier end to Medicaid expansion even earlier, among other provisions.\nPresident Trump promised to repeal Obamacare on the campaign trail, but also vowed to keep some of its popular provisions, such as requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The Republican bill — which ended the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion in addition to getting the essential health benefit requirements — was considered too extreme for moderate Republicans.\nMembers of the orthodox conservative Freedom Caucus were also interested in dumping the popular requirements for insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions and the provision allowing adults up to age 26 to remain on their parents’ health insurance. After meeting with the president on Thursday afternoon, caucus members said they had not yet reached a deal on the bill and that no “firm changes” were agreed to.\nAs Republicans went to meetings to make negotiations on the bill, Democrats spoke on the House floor to oppose the bill.\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said, “It’s lord of the flies day here in the House of Representatives … The whole process has been a debacle … There has been no process, no deliberation, and now no bill. The polls show people are turning dramatically against that wreck of legislation.”\nOnly 17 percent of American voters approve of the American Health Care Act, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released on Thursday. Seventy-four percent opposed cutting federal funding for Medicaid.\nThe Koch brothers’ network of dark money groups gave Republicans a financial incentive to opposed the legislation. Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, said they would work together to create a new fund to support conservatives who voted against it, Politico reported .\nLess than two hours before news of the vote postponement started to circulate, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters there was no Plan B if the AHCA did not pass on Thursday.\n“It’s gonna pass,” he said. “So that’s it.”\nQ: Is there a backup plan if the health bill doesn't pass tonight? Spicer: \"No. It's gonna pass. So that's it.\" https://t.co/fUo8BBnBPU \n —  @BraddJaffy \nHouse vote on Trumpcare gets delayed after a wave of Republican defections was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T21:59:19.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
