Along with it, the company is launching some 150 integrations with third-party services like Asana, Zendesk and Hootsuite. \n(No word on when and whether Teams would expand outside the Office 365 ecosystem: “We’ve had some discussions but right now remain focused on our huge user base,” noted Mira Lane, Microsoft Teams’ UX lead.) \nThe wider launch comes in the wake of some reasonable success so far. Microsoft said the Teams preview has had some 50,000 organizations sign up and try out the service. \nThat figure includes both companies that have tried it out as well as those who have stayed on to become active users, and Microsoft would only tell me that many stay on, with the number of people per company ranging from small groups to organizations with hundreds of users. (Notable customer wins, it said, include Accenture, Alaska Airlines, Conoco Phillips, Deloitte, Expedia, J.B. Hunt, J. Walter Thompson, Hendrick Motorsports, Trek Bicycle and Three UK.) \nFor a new app that is coming to the market after the meteoric rise of Slack, as well as other competing services like Workplace from Facebook and Hipchat from Atlassian, some might argue that Teams and Microsoft are late to the game. In its favor, Microsoft is banking on the low-friction aspect of the service: those being targeted are already using Microsoft apps like Excel, Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, SharePoint and Power BI, so there will be familiarity and convenience. And it’s free to try out. \nAs we noted when Microsoft first debuted the service in November, Teams throws a lot at the user from the start. If you’ve ever used something like Word or Excel, you know that this is a very Microsoft approach. \nThe basic interface follows a lot of what you might already know for workplace collaboration products, which are often based around a left rail that lists discussion groups, and the main stream to the right that charts conversations. Within that Microsoft takes you into a range of different options that tap into its many other products. These include direct chats, the option to hold audio and video calls, call in spreadsheets and other documents, run some analytics, and more. \nOn top of this, Microsoft has built a chatbot framework that initially is dedicated to helping you use Teams better, but over time will include integrations built by developers to bring in a variety of other services too, similar to Slack, Messenger and a number of other chat services. \nWill this be enough to sway users? “We’re seeing people kicking the tyres on all products and looking for something more enterprise grade,” Lane noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T17:39:08.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
