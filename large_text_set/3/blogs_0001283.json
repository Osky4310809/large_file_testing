It’s really cool when a service that collects your data can turn it around and make something useful without you needing to ask for it. Google is leading the charge with service like Google Maps and Google Now. If you’ve ever wondered how those services become so good, the answer is simple—Google is tracking all of your information.\nThis isn’t exactly a secret. We’ve covered Google’s exhuming of information in the past, you can read about that here and here . Google uses its far ranging services to track user movement for literally everything. Google Maps, Google Search, YouTube, Allo, its AI assistant/messaging platform—all of these services are used to create an extensive map of what you like, where you go, what you buy or what you want.\nGoogle even keeps transcripts of voice dictation and geo-tags from pictures users have uploaded to its free photo software (Google Photos) to continue to recreate the world of its users. The end game for Google is to get as much information as it can.\nIn case you want to cut off Google access to information, you need to really commit to shun the search giant. It’s nearly impossible to go through life without using one of its services. Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Photos and billions of Android devices are at its disposal. Kind of scary isn’t it? As long as it doesn’t become self-aware, we’ll be good, but you can pretty much kiss goodbye any sort of privacy you thought you had.\nCheck out the video above to learn more about Google information consumption.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T03:02:48.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
