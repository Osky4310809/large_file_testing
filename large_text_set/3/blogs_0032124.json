But she left little doubt she believes the White House should act as a guardian of women’s rights around the world. “Together with the international community,” she said, “the United States must send a clear message that we are watching.” \nAdvertisement   “As leaders of our shared global community,” Mrs. Trump said, “we must continue to work towards gender empowerment and respect for people from all backgrounds and ethnicities, remembering always that we are all ultimately members of one race, the human race.” \nAdvertisement For Mrs. Trump, the appearance marked a period of greater visibility, after several weeks when she spent much of her time in New York with the Trumps’ son, Barron, who is in school there. \nAdvertisement   Stephanie Grisham, Ms. Trump’s new communications director, noted that the first lady had taken part in Mr. Trump’s visits with foreign leaders, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. She has also visited schools and children’s hospitals, Ms. Grisham said, and looked forward to playing host for the White House Easter egg roll on April 17. Whether intentional or not, the first lady’s speech kicked off a day in which the White House reached out to women, and sought to make amends for bruised feelings. At the daily White House news briefing, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, called first on April Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks. On Tuesday Mr. Spicer had a tense exchange with Ms. Ryan, who is African-American, which culminated with him ordering her to stop shaking her head during one of his answers. \nAdvertisement   “How are you today?” a solicitous Mr. Spicer asked Ms. Ryan, who said she was fine. A few hours later, Mrs. Trump was on hand when her husband marked the end of Women’s History Month by showing up at a panel in the East Room devoted to women’s issues, in which female members of his cabinet were taking part. Mr. Trump praised “the legendary Abigail Adams” and Susan B. Anthony . “Have you heard of Susan B. Anthony?” he asked with a grin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T03:51:04.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
