Garfield; 1881, William McKinley; 1901 and John F. Kennedy; 1963) while Ronald Reagan and Theodore Roosevelt survived shooting attempts while in office. \nThe United States Senator continued, “I think people can disagree on policy but you’ve got to be very careful about that kind of thing because the wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you can have a real problem. So I’m not sure what Snoop was thinking, he should think about that a little bit.” BADBADNOTGOOD f. Kaytranada & Snoop Dogg –“Lavender (Nightfall Remix)” \nAfterward, the interviewer asked Rubio “How’s everything else?” to which the senator replied, “It’s just going” with a sly grin as he made his way back to his transport. Anyone with two working eyes and ears can read between the lines of that parting exchange. \nThe now controversial “Lavender (Nightfall Remix)” is directed by Jesse Wellens and James DeFina and stars veteran actor Michael Rapaport.
