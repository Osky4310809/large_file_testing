Could it be the drug cartels, immigrants or both? \nThe excerpt of the transcript also does not contain President Peña Nieto’s response to Trump’s threat. \nPerhaps this is encouraging to Trump supporters — to see the man they voted for being as blunt as he was on the campaign trail to world leaders. \nHowever, the phone call was originally intended to be an olive branch. \nAfter Trump promised to make Mexico pay for his border wall with Mexico saying it would never pay, the two leaders who are meant to be allies may have gotten off on the wrong foot. \n(Also, let’s not forget the time Trump called Mexicans rapists and criminals. ) \nBefore the call, Peña Nieto canceled a planned visit to the United States because of the border wall conflict. Reuters \nAccording to the excerpt, Trump said, \nYou have a bunch of bad hombres down there. You aren’t doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn’t, so I just might send them down to take care of it. \nThe source of the transcript is remaining anonymous because the administration didn’t want to make the details of the call public. \nWhile some Mexican reporters published similar accounts of the story, even going as far as saying Trump humiliated Peña Nieto, Mexico’s foreign relations department denied the account, saying the tone of the conversation was “constructive.” \nThey continued, \n[I]t was agreed by the presidents to continue working and that the teams will continue to meet frequently to construct an agreement that is positive for Mexico and for the United States. \nThere is around $1.6 billion a day in cross-border trade conducted by the US and Mexico. \nTrump is allowing his senior adviser, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner — a real estate executive with no foreign policy experience — to manage the dispute between the two countries now. \nBut Donald Trump was a reality TV star before he became president, so who knows what Kushner will be able to do? \nShoot, I’ve got that lack of experience on my résumé. If I were a rich person instead of a white trash hillbilly from the holler, maybe Trump would give me a job? Which Bold Campaigns Promises will Trump Keep?
