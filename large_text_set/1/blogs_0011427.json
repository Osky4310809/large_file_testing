They are not an actual part of the shinobi force, as they are still in the process of mastering the very basics of the ninja lifestyle. However, they can be conscripted as part of the war potential in times of emergency. Genin Edit \nMain article: Genin Genin ( 下忍 , Literally meaning: low ninja, Meaning (Viz): junior ninja) are the lowest level of ninja and also the ones that display the most difference in power. When they become genin, ninja start to do their bit for their village's economy – being sent on missions that the village gets paid for. They are typically sent either on D-rank missions, which are almost entirely risk-free jobs of manual labour, or, rarely, on C-rank missions, which are a cut above that and begin to verge on real \"ninja\" work that have a very low possibility of risk to the ninja involved. When Konohagakure was short-handed on upper-level ninja because of the invasion , the village had to occasionally send genin on higher-ranked missions. Chūnin Edit \nMain article: Chūnin Chūnin ( 中忍 , Literally meaning: Middle Ninja, Meaning (Viz): Journeyman Ninja) are ninja who are qualified to guide other ninja and lead missions. Chūnin have reached a level of maturity and ability that primarily consists of leadership skills and tactical prowess. Genin who do not have the skills to become chūnin are weeded out in the Chūnin Exams . Some of them, like Iruka Umino , Daikoku Funeno , Shino Aburame and Suzume move on to function as Academy teachers and others, like Shikamaru Nara , serve as team leaders in charge of small teams who need to make decisions and utilise the skills of the shinobi under their command to the maximum effect. Chūnin are typically sent on C-rank or B-rank missions. Tokubetsu Jōnin Edit \nMain article: Tokubetsu Jōnin Tokubetsu Jōnin ( 特別上忍 , Tokubetsu Jōnin , English TV: Special Jōnin, Literally meaning: Special High Ninja, sometimes known as Tokujō for short) are ninja who, rather than all-around jōnin training, have jōnin-level ability in a specific area or skill, much like warrant officers in real-world militaries. They are elite specialists in their areas and are often assigned as subordinates to regular jōnin when their services are needed. Jōnin Edit \nMain article: Jōnin Jōnin ( 上忍 , Jōnin , Literally meaning: High Ninja, Meaning (Viz): Elite Ninja) are generally highly-experienced shinobi with great individual skill who serve as military captains. They are often sent on A-rank missions, and experienced jōnin may even be sent on S-rank missions (which are considered to be the greatest difficulty). It is not unusual for jōnin to go on missions alone. Jōnin are generally able to use at least two types of elemental chakra , [1] proficient genjutsu , and decent taijutsu skills. Kage Edit \nMain article: Kage Kage ( 影 , Literally meaning: Shadow) is a title reserved for the leader of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries ' hidden villages . They are collectively known as the Five Kage ( 五影 , Gokage , Literally meaning: Five Shadows). A Kage oversees the activities of their village, from sending ninja on missions to making the hard decisions regarding the safety of their people. A village's Kage is generally acknowledged as its most powerful ninja. Teams Edit \nAlthough the higher-ranking members of the regular forces often perform missions alone, most are done in teams. The most basic team is the one a genin is placed in after graduation. This so-called three-man cell consists of three genin under the guidance of a jōnin commander. These teams are meant to give the new shinobi practical skills, while already being a productive member of the organisation. Usually, strong bonds are cultivated between the members of such a team, lasting their entire lives. Because of these bonds and the fact that working with one's long-time teammates is usually more efficient, these teams often last even after all members have been promoted to chūnin or higher. \nBesides these basic teams, there are also teams, and groups created for specific missions and tasks. Sometimes these are ad hoc teams which only exist for the duration of the mission, such as the Sasuke Recovery Team , but in certain cases these teams are more organised and lasting, such as the Nijū Shōtai , created to battle the threat of Akatsuki . Special Ranks and Functions Edit \nBesides the standard ranks of genin, chūnin, tokubetsu jōnin, and jōnin, there are some shinobi who bear a special rank or function. For instance, Kumogakure has a rank between that of jōnin and Raikage which is known as \" Head Ninja \". This person helps in leading the shinobi forces and is capable of representing the village officially. Konohagakure has the Jōnin Commander , who is selected from the jōnin population to represent the regular forces in council meetings and likely helps in commanding the regular forces. Anbu Edit \nMain article: Anbu The Anbu ( 暗部 , English TV: Anbu Black Ops, Literally meaning: Dark Side), short for Ansatsu Senjutsu Tokushu Butai ( 暗殺戦術特殊部隊 , Literally meaning: Special Assassination and Tactical Squad), are covert operatives dispatched by their Kage , within Konohagakure , Kirigakure and Sunagakure . Groups Edit \nThere are various groups within the Anbu, aimed at various different functions and tasks. Kirigakure , for instance, has the hunter-nin — a group created solely for hunting down and disposing of missing-nin . Konohagakure has the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force , who interrogate prisoners and work to gather intelligence. Though they were to officially disband, another Anbu faction named Root carried out extremely secretive missions and were not under the direct authority of previous Hokage. Medical Teams Edit \nThe medical teams ( 医療班 , Iryō-han ) is the supporting side of the shinobi forces. They consist of medical-nin , working behind the scenes to heal sick and injured shinobi and to make sure the organisation's resources are always in peak condition. Medical-nin are similar to a Hospital Corpsman or HM of the military in real life. They also do extensive research into new techniques, medicines, diseases and the human body. Although not seen very often, they are highly respected. Even to a jōnin, the advanced skills of these shinobi seem like magic. \nNot all medical-nin are members of the medical teams, though. There are also medical-nin within the regular forces, who go along on standard missions to increase the success-rate referred to as field medical-nin. Though medical-nin from the hospital are sent out into the fields from time to time as seen when a group of medical-nin were sent after the Sasuke Recovery Team. However, back in the village, it is the medical teams who run the hospital and treat the wounded. Trivia Edit Between the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War and the events of The Last: Naruto the Movie , Sai changes his rank from \"Anbu\" to Chūbu ( 柱部 , chūbu ). Currently, it is neither known what exactly this change implies, nor where the rank is to be located in the organisational system.
