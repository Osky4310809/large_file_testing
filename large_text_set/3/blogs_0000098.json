Photo by Tristan Tamayo/INQUIRER.net \nFar Eastern University continued its hot streak in the UAAP Season 79 women’s volleyball tournament, taking down University of the Philippines, 25-17, 24-26, 25-23, 25-19, Wednesday at Filoil Flying V Centre. \nThe Lady Tamaraws improved to 4-2 while extending their unbeaten run to three games while the Lady Maroons, who have the same record as FEU, slipped to their second straight loss. \nDespite the three-game win streak, FEU head coach Shaq Delos Santos said they can never be too complacent since the tournament is heading into the end of the first round. ADVERTISEMENT \n“I still want us to improve because we still have lapses, and we want to maintain our level of play,” said Delos Santos. \nThe Lady Tamaraws had the advantage in all scoring categories with a 50-44 edge on spikes, 9-4 on blocks, and 10-8 on service aces. \nFEU, despite its better offensive game than UP, gave away 29 free points due to its errors. \nBernadeth Pons led the Lady Tamaraws with 24 points while Toni Rose Basas and Remy Palma combined for 22. \nA scary moment happened to UP in the second set when veteran Nicole Tiamzon limped off the playing floor after spraining one of her ankles. \nDiana Carlos and Isa Molde combined for 28 points to lead UP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:54:50.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
