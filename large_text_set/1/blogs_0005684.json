This calculator gives you an idea of just how many calories you start off burning each day. Advertisement \nThis tool calculates your Basal Metabolic Rate, which refers to the amount of calories it takes to keep you alive. Note, this calculator is by no means exact. In fact, metabolism can vary so much from one person to another that it’s impossible to know an exact number. However, it’s still a handy way to get some perspective. \nFor example, the calculator says that a 25-year-old 5'10\" male who weighs 160 pounds will burn over 1,700 calories just staying alive. That’s a hefty chunk of your diet each day. However, working out for an hour might burn a couple hundred extra calories. Compared to the amount you burn just living, that’s not a lot. Advertisement \nOf course, your health is about much more than your calorie count. Working out provides a ton of benefits beyond burning calories. Likewise, you can eat just the right amount of calories and still eat garbage. However, if you ever wondered just how much it takes to keep you alive each day, this calculator is a handy peek into your own body’s inner workings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T15:35:36.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
