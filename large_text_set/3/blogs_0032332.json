The new title is set between the second and third games of the series and sees players take control of either Scott or Sara Ryder as they explore the Andromeda Galaxy aboard a ship called Tempest. It launched to mixed reviews.\nCheck out Sony’s teaser video for the theme below.\nIn its Play Store listing, Sony says, “The Tempest soars through asteroids and Ryder contemplates his quest across the cosmos, subtly breathing and moving as you scroll.”\nI haven’t been keeping up with Sony’s Xperia themes in the last year or so, but this does look like one of the more impressive ones that it has produced.\nPick up the theme for free in the Google Play Store here , and check out the others Sony has to offer here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T14:06:50.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
