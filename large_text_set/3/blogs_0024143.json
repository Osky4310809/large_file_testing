As Quartz noted earlier this week , Domino’s share price growth has outpaced the most successful tech companies in the world since 2010. \nNow, part of this is because some of those tech companies were already in a good place when Domino’s started its turnaround. But it still compares favorably to companies like Netflix and Tesla, who have also come to greater prominence over that time. \nIf you’re wondering why we’re talking about pizza in a tech column, much of Domino’s turnaround can be credited to its embrace of modern technology. It improved its actual pizza in 2009, yes, but it’s continually built out its ordering app , rolled out custom delivery cars with built-in ovens, and made it so you can order food with emojis , among other things. It’s all a bit silly, but those who’ve stuck with the company are probably laughing all the way to the bank. \nBusiness Insider/Jeff Dunn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:05:28.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
