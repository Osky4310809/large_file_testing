But as aid workers got into areas the Islamic militants had controlled, the suffering they left behind became clear in the last six months, said Toby Lanzer, the U.N’s humanitarian coordinator for the region. \n“What we have seen is extraordinary,” he said at a news briefing at U.N . headquarters. “I have seen adults sapped of all energy, who are almost unable to walk. We have had villages and towns devoid of 2- and 3- and 4-year-old children because they’ve died.” \nSome totally destroyed towns had been cut off from the outside world for more than three years, Lanzer said. \nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari declared that Boko Haram was “technically defeated” in December 2015, but attacks have continued in some places. Two women suicide bombers killed 57 people and wounded 177 in December at a northeastern Nigerian market, in violence blamed on Boko Haram . \nSaying that Nigeria and the Lake Chad region are enduring the worst humanitarian crisis in Africa, the U.N . is launching a more than $1 billion appeal and hopes a conference meeting next month in Oslo, Norway will spur donations, Lanzer said. \nAbout 11 million people are “in desperate need” of aid, about 7.1 million of them are “severely food-insecure” — essentially, getting one meal a day if they can — and roughly 515 , 000 children are or soon will be severely, acutely malnourished , Lanzer said. \n“If they don’t get the help they need on time, they die,” he said. \nWhile the Nigerian government has stepped up efforts to help, an international effort is needed, Lanzer said. \nBuhari, however, has accused the U.N . and aid agencies of exaggerating the crisis to seek donations. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T04:38:26.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
