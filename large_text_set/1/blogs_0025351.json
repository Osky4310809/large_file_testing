In fact, per the new poll, 57% of likely U.S. voters actually approve of the ban while only 33% were opposed. \nA new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 57% of Likely U.S. Voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen until the federal government approves its ability to screen out potential terrorists from coming here . Thirty-three percent (33%) are opposed, while 10% are undecided. \n\nSimilarly, 56% favor a temporary block on visas prohibiting residents of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States until the government approves its ability to screen for likely terrorists. Thirty-two percent (32%) oppose this temporary ban, and 11% are undecided. \n\nThis survey was taken late last week prior to the weekend protests against Trump’s executive orders imposing a four-month ban on all refugees and a temporary visa ban on visitors from these seven countries. \n\nLike most issues, support for the immigration ban was heavily split along party lines with 82% of Republicans supporting the executive order versus only 34% of Democrats and 53% of Independents. \nThe refugee ban is supported by 82% of Republicans and 59% of voters not affiliated with either major party. Democrats are opposed by a 53% to 34% margin. The numbers are nearly identical for the temporary ban on visas from these seven terrorist-plagued nations. \n\nMen and women are in general agreement on both measures. Younger voters are slightly less supportive than their elders are. \n\nBlacks oppose both bans more than whites and other majority voters do. \nAs we pointed out earlier (see \" Is A Constitutional Crisis Imminent In The Wake Of Trump's Immigration Ban? \"), the ACLU, flush with $24 million in donations from just this weekend alone, has vowed to fight Trump's immigration ban all the way to the Supreme Court on grounds that it targets people of a certain religion, in direct violation of the First Amendment. \nThat said, many legal scholars have asserted that Trump's immigration ban will stand up against Constitutional tests, with GWU professor Jonathan Turley saying the ban can't be viewed as a \"Muslim ban\" given the \"vast majority of Muslims around the world are not affected by the limitations placed on these seven countries.” \nStill, some observers said the courts ultimately might uphold Trump’s order. Its alleged anti-Muslim thrust “is not clear to me,” said Eugene Volokh, a professor at UCLA School of Law . Judges might interpret the order as targeting people from countries where “jihadist sentiments” are common, he said. The president generally has broad authority to exclude non-citizens from coming into the country, Volokh said. \n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, predicted the courts would not interpret the order as a religious ban. “It is not on its face a Muslim ban,” he said. “That dog simply won’t hunt. No judge can look at the order and analyze it as a Muslim ban because the vast majority of Muslims around the world are not affected by the limitations placed on these seven countries.” \nBut while the ACLU is looking for a Supreme Court battle, Trump continues to fight in the court of public opinion, which, at least according to Rasmussen, is a fight he's winning. There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017 If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there! Beam Me Up Scotty Croesus Jan 30, 2017 8:34 PM \nWhy are we letting these people in???? Its not as if they are coming here to become Americans, in the 1776 sense of the word. They just want to haul their lifestyle over here, and inflict it upon the rest of us. Sharia law is inconsistent with Liberty and Freedom. If thats what they want, they can stay in the shithole from which they came. \nBut why is it every time Schmucky's vagina bleeds that the REPUBES have to feel its pain? \nSend the spineless hairballs back crying to mothers twat. \nWhy do we have a McClown still? Chris Dakota mofreedom Jan 30, 2017 8:53 PM \nAnd the left still wonders why Trump won. \nDeath by a thousand cuts, to themselves every time they attack the man who wants to actually fix things for all of us. \nWoof Shitzer still talks in his sleep saying Trump has less then a 1.7% chance of winning. \nlol Beam Me Up Scotty 813kml Jan 30, 2017 8:51 PM \nI am all for stopping the bombing. Its not as if its made us any safer. Why/When did liberal democrats become warmongers BTW?? Funny how all of those anti-war liberals were silenced when Obama got into office. So much for being anti-war. chiquita Beam Me Up Scotty Jan 30, 2017 9:09 PM \nYou would think that the liberals would make the connection--if the damned war ended as Obama had promised or if he and Hillary as Sec/State had done a better job of negotiating things over there, we wouldn't be dealing with this refugee crisis or the need to ban these people looking for a place to go. The US wasn't the only country bombing over there, but under Obama, we did a huge amount of damage. Where were these bleeding hearts then? Where was that Cindy Sheehan woman that was so ubiquitous with her anti-war protesting during the Bush administration? Did Obama send her on an 8 year vacation? lil dirtball balolalo Jan 30, 2017 9:04 PM \n>they actually go to work to provide for their families \nFarcical. They go to work for the merchants to provide for the merchants and useless .gov 'workers'. The fact that they are allowed to keep a few shekels for themselves is moot outside of allowing them to eat and buy fake piss for their urine tests. \nAnd - every day they 'go to work' is a another day this swirling bowl gets perpetuated. If they merely stayed home with the other 95M 'unemployed' and did nothing but for themselves, this shitshow would come to a grinding halt in days and real negotiations for change could be had, starting with telling them to fuck their 'Privacy Statements' and ending the complete saturation of surveillance of the domestic population. \nBut no, lets place our bets on an unscrupulous Orange Julius FTW - on poor odds, no less - instead of actually doing it ourselves. \n~ \n\"It's propaganda. It softens your brain while you read.\" \n\"Mmmm ... sounds sublime.\" \nWHAT?! The Silent Majority supports not admitting immigrants that can't be vetted from highly terrorist-active countries?! \nWhy, they're a bunch of RAYCISS XENOPHOBES! They probably hate puppies, too! HRH Feant Croesus Jan 30, 2017 9:02 PM \nYes, we do support banning both Muslims and unscreened refugees. Our own government officials told us last year that they were unable to fully screen applicants! Evidence of the incompetence of the UNHCR has been growing in Europe for years and the result in Europe, and the US, is nothing but more killing sprees by gun or by IED or by a vehicle. \nPeople are waking up to the reality that the government has not been doing jack fucking shit to protect us for decades! This is all about the different hands sucking off the DC tits to see what they get while the only thing the common person gets is a fucking tax bill from the goddamned IRS and a go-to-hell-fuck-off-and-die letter if they miss one mortgage payment or one property tax bill! \nPeople are fed up. I don't know anyone that has time to go protest in a city: one the parking fees cost a fortune. Two, they can't afford to take off time from work or their business to just hang out on the fucking street for hours and cause trouble. Three, they have to do everything from make dinner to laundry to grocery shopping along with trying to sleep at least 4 hours a night. \nFuck the goddamned commie leftists. I am sick to fucking death of them and their bullshit protests. Get a job. Get a life. And don't tell me I have to pay for your bullshit fucking fantasies of kumbaya bullshit with my tax dollars. ACLU is a GOD hating Communist Organization full of DESPOTS with a REPROBATE MIND. These people are a CLEAR and PRESENT DANGER to the Sovereignty of the USA. They need to be dismantled how ever that occurs. What American in their right mind can give one penny to this corrupt, GOD Hating and immoral organization. Below is supporting t ext. THE ACLU'S SHOCKING LEGACY Published: 08/25/2005 at 1:00 AM Editor’s note: Be sure to get your copy of Alan Sears’ powerful new book, “ The ACLU vs. America: Exposing the Agenda to Redefine Moral Values .” One of the great myths of the 20th – and now 21st – century is the belief that the American Civil Liberties Union was an organization that had a noble beginning, but somehow strayed off course. That myth is untrue. The ACLU set a course to destroy America – her freedom and her values – right from the start. From its very beginning, the ACLU had strong socialist and communist ties. As early as 1931, the U.S. Congress was alarmed by the ACLU’s devotion to communism. A report by the Special House Committee to Investigate Communist Activities stated The American Civil Liberties Union is closely affiliated with the communist movement in the United States, and fully 90 percent of its efforts are on behalf of communists who have come into conflict with the law. It claims to stand for free speech, free press and free assembly, but it is quite apparent that the main function of the ACLU is an attempt to protect the communists. Roger Baldwin and Crystal Eastman founded the ACLU in 1920 along with three other organizations dedicated to the most leftist of causes. The histories of these two individuals belie their claims of patriotism and respect for the Constitution. Baldwin openly sought the utter destruction of American society. Fifteen years after the founding of the ACLU, Baldwin wrote: I am for Socialism, disarmament and ultimately, for the abolishing of the State itself … I seek the social ownership of property, the abolition of the propertied class and sole control of those who produce wealth. Communism is the goal. Earl Browder, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, admitted that the ACLU served as a “transmission belt” for the party. Baldwin agreed, claiming, “I don’t regret being a part of the communist tactic which increased the effectiveness of a good cause.” Baldwin was a devoted follower of the anarchist Emma Goldman (or “Red Emma” as she was called), who was eventually deported to the Soviet Union in 1919 for her communist activities. Goldman was a consistent promoter of anarchism, radical education, “free love” and birth control. According to an online exhibit of Goldman’s papers , her career “served as inspiration for Roger Baldwin, a future founder of the American Civil Liberties Union.” Eastman was a zealous feminist, an anti-war activist, and a great admirer of the Soviet revolution. Of her many leftist friends and associates, Eastman held the highest regard for Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger. According to Eastman, “We [feminists] must all be followers of Margaret Sanger.” Of course, Sanger was a passionate advocate of eugenics – the attempt to improve the human race through selective breeding. Abortion was a primary means to this “improvement,” leading Sanger to write, “The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.” Baldwin also was a great admirer of the Planned Parenthood founder. He heaped praise on Sanger: “She was a frail, beautiful, unassuming woman … She always had a quiet insistence on the rightness of what she was doing.” This adoration of Sanger set the tone for the tragic history of the ACLU concerning the issue of abortion. To this day, the group fights for the most extreme of pro-abortion positions, including support for partial-birth abortion and opposition to parental consent for minors. But the radical agenda hardly ends there. In his wedding vows, Baldwin called marriage as between one man and one woman “a grim mockery of essential freedom.” He added, “The highest relationship between a man and a woman is that which welcomes and understands each other’s loves.” The result is that today the ACLU is a leading advocate of same-sex “marriage,” and has expressed support for polygamy and polyamory (“open” marriage) as well. The ACLU Policy Guide reads: The ACLU believes that criminal and civil laws prohibiting or penalizing the practice of plural marriage [polygamy or polyamory] violate constitutional protections of freedom of expression and association, freedom of religion, and privacy for personal relationships among consenting adults. \nWhile many accept the ACLU as a mainstream organization, their history tells a drastically different story. Organizations such as the Alliance Defense Fund are dedicated to exposing the myth that the ACLU is working hard for the First Amendment rights of Americans. Instead of being an organization that simply took a “wrong turn,” the ACLU has devoted itself from the very beginning to the devastation of America’s most cherished traditions, values, and laws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T04:21:34.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
