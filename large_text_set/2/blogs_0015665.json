We cannot perceive truth without clothing. \nSo Truth dresses up for us, in a story, in sage advice, in a blueprint of the cosmos—in clothes woven from the fabric of truth itself. \nAnd then, before we can imagine that we have grasped Truth, it switches clothes. It tells us another story—entirely at odds with the first. It tells us new advice—to go in a different direction. It provides another model of how things are—in which each thing has changed its place. \nThe fool is confused. He exclaims, \"Truth has lied!\" \nThe wise person sees within and finds harmony between all the stories, all the advice, every model we are told. \nFor the Torah is a simple, pure light, a truth no box can contain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:26:18.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
