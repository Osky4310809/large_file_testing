Those days are gone. Gibraltar crumbled, Rome fell, and Comic Sans has descended from its cheaply upholstered sans serif throne in the community reading room at the San Rafael Public Library.

(It was called Maternity Munchies, and was aimed at pregnant women who have just a little bit of an edge going , and was a very good idea, but that’s neither here nor there.) It was also during the 20th century that you watched a lot of films entitled things like “Our Expanding Universe” when you had a sub in sixth-grade life sciences because your real teacher was out with what was rumored to be a “sex injury.” Advertisement \nIn that same century perhaps you turned in a paper on “the Epic of Gilgamesh,” on which you received a “needs improvement,” in this font. \nIt could also be the 21st century, though, because that was the century in which your stepmom used this font, in gold against a maroon background, on the holiday card that didn’t mention you even though you promptly responded to her October email requesting “relevant updates.” \nIndeed, it was in this century that the office manager at your veterinarian began using this in her email signature below her persistent reminders that your dog’s heartworm medication is ready for pickup and there is a $15 fee to hold it over night.
