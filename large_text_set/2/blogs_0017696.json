Everything was getting bigger. I automatically got this hate and judgment online.”\nEvery time she left the house, Winter continued, “there would be an article the next day being like ‘Ariel Winter [had] her boobs out at this event.’”\nIt took a great toll on her mental health, which is understandable given that Winter is still a freaking teenager and really shouldn’t have to read creepy, judgmental comments about her body online.\n…Which is why we’re glad to see the now 19-year-old taking bold fashion risks at events like Tuesday night’s Vanity Fair And L’Oreal Paris Toast To Young Hollywood party, instead of covering up and hiding in her body like a damn snail. She rocked a cutout bodysuit and lace sarong to the party, clearly showing the world that she cares little whether or not we think she’s showing too much skin.\nEmma McIntyre/Getty Images for Vanity Fair She looks like she’s ready for the beach!\nCharley Gallay/Getty Images for Vanity Fair Between this and the trip to Australia she recently took with her boyfriend, Levi Meaden, Winter is clearly having a blast — and feeling comfortable in her own skin — in 2017.\nShe wanted us all to do Blue Steel but we weren't down. #selfie @tarongazoo \nA post shared by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) on Feb 19, 2017 at 3:12pm PST \nTeach us your ways, girl.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:07:29.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
