And Crosby had to make the winner twice after Dallas coach Jason Garrett called timeout before the first attempt. \nRodgers, who sparked last week’s wild-card win over the New York Giants with another Hail Mary before halftime, is headed to an MVP showdown with Atlanta’s Matt Ryan next Sunday. It will be his third NFC title game — all on the road. \n“Unbelievable effort. I mean, what a game, what a game,” said Rodgers, who threw for 356 yards with two touchdowns. “We’re going to celebrate this and move on to Atlanta. We’re just going to enjoy this right now.” \nGreen Bay’s win was the first by a road team after 12 straight home victories in the playoffs dating to last season. The Packers were the previous road team to win — over Washington in last season’s wild-card round. \nThe Cowboys (13-4) almost became the third team in the Super Bowl era to win in the playoffs after trailing by 15 points in the fourth quarter. The first was Dallas in 1972, when “Captain Comeback”, Roger Staubach, rallied the Cowboys for a 30-28 win over San Francisco. \nInstead, top-seeded Dallas ended up with its fifth straight loss in the divisional round and a 21-year drought in trips to the NFC championship game. \nPrescott, whose 11-game winning streak during the regular season sent Tony Romo to the bench when he was ready to return from a back injury, rallied the Cowboys in a way that probably made Dallas’ 10-year starter proud. \nThe fourth-round pick, who was supposed to be the No. 3 quarterback before injuries changed everything, got Dallas’ rally going with a 40-yard touchdown toss in the first half to Bryant, the first playoff TD for the star receiver. \nThen he set the stage for the first tying score on a 6-yarder to Jason Witten, also the first postseason touchdown for the 14th-year tight end. \nRodgers led the Packers to a go-ahead 56-yard field goal from Crosby with a big boost on a pass interference penalty against rookie Anthony Brown that wiped out an interception from Jeff Heath, whose pick earlier in the game helped Dallas rally. \nThe Cowboys answered with a 52-yarder from Bailey. \nPrescott threw for 302 yards and three touchdowns with an interception, and Elliott had 125 yards rushing. \nRodgers didn’t seem to miss receiver Jordy Nelson, out with a rib injury sustained in the win over the Giants. \nRodgers found six different receivers, including a 34-yard touchdown to Richard Rodgers that was his longest since catching one of three successful Hail Mary passes from Aaron Rodgers in the past 13 months. \nSAY AGAIN? \nThe Cowboys had a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that doesn’t happen often. Dallas had a first down wiped out by the penalty against receiver Brice Butler, who wasn’t even part of the play. And that was actually the issue. \nReferee Tony Corrente threw the flag immediately after the snap. After Terrance Williams made a catch the referee announced that Butler was penalized for going into the offensive huddle and then leaving the field. \nThere was even more confusion when the penalty was initially marked off only 5 yards. After Packers coach Mike McCarthy pointed it out, Corrente announced the correction and the ball was moved back another 10 yards. The Cowboys punted soon after. \nUP NEXT \nPackers: At Atlanta in the NFC championship game next Sunday. \n___ \nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T04:41:45.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
