Slot to Auburn Links Kaylee Carlson pitched a three-hit shutout to lead Auburn past Florida. (Photo: Auburn University) \nIndomitable right-hander Kaylee Carlson wouldn’t let Auburn be swept, not even by the nation’s No. 1 team. \nCarlson pitched her second complete game in three days on Monday, shutting out the Gators on three hits as the Tigers won a tense pitchers’ duel 1-0 to close out their series in Gainesville. They would have been celebrating winning the series had two misplays resulted in two Florida runs with two outs in the seventh inning Saturday. \nFlorida won that won 4-3 and won 7-0 on Sunday. On Monday, Carlson left nothing to chance. She made the final out on a hard hit ball off her leg. She went and got it and threw to first in time to get Amanda Lorenz and end the game. \nAuburn ended Florida’s 21-game winning streak and gave the Gators their first SEC loss. Auburn, ranked No. 4 in one major poll and No. 6 in the other, improved to 28-5 overall and 3-3 in the SEC. Florida fell to 29-2 and 7-1. \nWhen the game was over, senior Auburn shortstop Haley Fagan and Florida coach Tim Walton exchanged seemingly angry words. It was not immediately clear why. \nFlorida left-hander Delanie Gourley dazzled Auburn’s hitters, giving up three hits and striking out 10 and walking just one. But all it took was one swing of Kendall Veach ’s bat. With one out in the second inning, Veach drove a 2-1 pitch over the left field fence for her eighth home run. \nThere would be no more scoring on this day. \nCarlson pitched around five walks. She struck out four. Florida left seven runners on base. Another was erased on a double play. \nIn the fourth, the Gators put runners on second and third with one out. Carlson struck out Aleshia Ocasio and got Sophia Reynoso to pop out to first to end the threat. \nThe Gators got two on with two out in the sixth, but Reynoso flied out to centerfield to end that threat. \nIn the seventh, Jaimie Hoover led off by drawing a walk. But Carlson was up to the challenge again. Pinch-hitter Teresa Swertfager , sent in to bunt, was called out when the home plate umpire said the ball hit her in fair territory. Justine McLean popped out on a running catch by Hagan in foul territory. Carlson made the play on Lorenz to end it. \nFagan and Carlee Wallace had singles for Auburn. \nCarlson improved to 15-1 for the season. Gourley fell to 11-2. \nAuburn goes on the road again next weekend, opening a three-game series at Georgia on Friday.
