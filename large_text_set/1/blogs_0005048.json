It is even more shameful that such an incident took place despite 1,500 cops patrolling the city who have yet to arrest the culprits.\nAs per eyewitness accounts, women were groped, molested and lewd remarks were passed by drunk hooligans and unruly elements. The worst affected were single women while men who were accompanying women had a hard time protecting them from unruly elements. This is simply not acceptable as Bengaluru is one of the largest IT clusters in the world. The state government needs to come down harshly on the perpetrators and provide all possible support to the victims to send a strong signal.\nON CAM: 2 men molest girl in Bengaluru https://t.co/W8BRinVEKr #BengaluruMolestation\n(Based on video footage sent by a TOI reader) pic.twitter.com/t11M5oOCF3\n— Times of India (@timesofindia) January 4, 2017\nManaging a large crowd is a basic function of the police force, especially when it is already known that people will gather in large numbers at specific places like MG Road and Brigade Road in the city. Then why wasn’t adequate police force put in place? Police claims to have installed CCTV cameras across the city. Is that was the case, then why haven’t they been able to identify the miscreants and take quick action against them? We need to change the mind-set of our law-enforcers who need to be sensitised to handle such situations. This could be one of the main reasons why there were 2.24 million crimes against women reported between in the last decade (2005-2014) which puts the figure at a complaint every two minutes .\n'I was groped, saw girls crying' https://t.co/loNal872OL #BengaluruMolestation\n(This is a first person account of Manisha Gupta) pic.twitter.com/qMYzW1HfHD\n— Times of India (@timesofindia) January 4, 2017\nThe National Commission for Women and Karnataka State Commission for Women have sought reports from the state administration over the incidents. As for the state government, rather than taking responsibility and initiating swift action, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara’s unwarranted comments of “these kinds of things do happen” reflect the lack of sensitivity which has rightly come under severe criticism. This is the time to provide the healing touch and assurance of law catching up with the offenders rather than make regressive statements which will only cause further alienation.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/816509776154664960", "https://t.co/W8BRinVEKr", "http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/crimes-against-women-reported-every-two-minutes-84240", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BengaluruMolestation?src=hash", "https://t.co/qMYzW1HfHD", "https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/816505708405362688", "https://t.co/loNal872OL", "https://t.co/t11M5oOCF3"], "published": "2017-01-04T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T07:47:33.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
