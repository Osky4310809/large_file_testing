We eat our meals on the go and toss the plastic containers in the trash. We get our coffee in a plastic cup on the way to work and then toss that as we enter the office, and we grab a plastic bottle water when we are thirsty – this bottle ends up right next to our coffee cup in the trash. However, Sky News’ new documentary “ A Plastic Tide ” asks us to slow down and think about where our plastic waste goes after we throw it out. The 45-minute film is part of the organizations Ocean Rescue campaign , a project that is working to raise awareness about the danger plastic pollution poses to marine environments and the animals that inhabit them – and this is a hugely important issue. \nThe film begins in Mumbai, India on a public beach that used to be a destination for swimmers but has become unusable due to the massive amount of plastic trash that has washed up on its shores. That’s right, the plastic waste on the sand is not from the locals, it has traveled untold distances and been deposited on these shores. You can probably find one of your water bottles amongst the rubbish. And this plastic is doing far worse things than running a few beachgoers afternoon swim, it is destroying marine ecosystems and killing marine life across the planet. \nAs a species, we produce 300 million tons of plastic every year and 40 percent of the plastic produced is disposable. Unfortunately, only 15 percent of plastic gets recycled, the rest makes its way into oceans and waterways. These plastics break down into tiny pieces, known as microplastics , and infiltrate ever facet of marine ecosystems . Currently, over 800 marine species are threatened by our plastic pollution and that number will continue to grow as long as we continue to use disposable plastics. \nWhile researchers are still trying to grapple with the consequences these microplastics have on the environment, a recent study shows that people who eat seafood will ingest 11,000 pieces of plastic every year – so humans are directly affected by this issue as well. \nAfroz Shah, a member of the Ocean Rescue project laments the deplorable conditions we are creating in our oceans and the destruction we are visiting on marine life, “[Marine animals are] crying for justice because we have messed up their houses.” \nYou can hear more from Shah and to watch the documentary in its entirety here . You can help the Ocean Rescue project clean up our oceans by cutting disposable plastics out of your life . \nTo learn how to do this, join One Green Planet’s #CrushPlastic movement and start cleaning up the earth’s waterways today.
