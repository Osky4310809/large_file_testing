But what if the cause is an untreated STD?\" writes Dr. Steven Beutler, who has \"spent over 30 years practicing medicine, specializing in infectious diseases.\"\nPeople online were quick to rip into Beutler's article and his controversial assessment of the president. Journalist Michael Tracey tweeted in response, \"Probably the lowest form of journalism is baselessly proposing psychoanalytical or medical explanations for political behavior.\"\nClick through reactions to article claiming Trump may have syphilis: \n\n\"Not sure why we're supposed to defend media when they put out banal malarkey like this,\" tweeted another user.\nTwitter user @JamGrex observed that The New Republic even once criticized GOPers who speculated about former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's health, tweeting, \"This is coming from the same site that complained when the right questioned Hillary's health.\"\nIn the article, Beutler argues that Trump has \"commonly recognized symptoms\" for the STD such as \"irritability, loss of ability to concentrate, delusional thinking, and grandiosity. Memory, insight, and judgment can become impaired. Insomnia may occur. Visual problems may develop, including the inability of pupils to react to the light.\"\nEven though Beutler does acknowledge he can't answer for sure if Trump suffers from \"this condition,\" he basically contradicts himself by saying he \"cannot, of course, establish this diagnosis from a distance,\" right after essentially writing a diagnosis from a distance.\nThere's a history of physicians attempting to diagnose politicians from afar, in fact, in 1973, following the 1964 presidential election, the American Psychiatric Association implemented the \" Goldwater Rule \" which states, \"it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.\"\nBut Trump's health has become par for the course for his opponents, and as the New Republic article points out, Sen. Al Franken recently slammed Trump over his health, claiming that 'a few' Republicans are worried about Trump's mental capacity.\nFranken continued saying Trump's actions are \"not the norm for a president of the United States, or, actually, for a human being.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T11:20:37.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
