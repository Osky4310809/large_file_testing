A senior BSP functionary said it wouldn’t have been proper to comment since the issue pertained to the family.\nParty sources said Mayawati has asked BSP functio naries to work quietly in their constituencies and focus on consolidation of Dalits and Muslims which together account for more than 40% of the total electorate.\nMayawati has not only asked her Muslim officials to hasten public meetings in Muslim areas but also concentrate on regions which have sizeable population of non-Yadav OBCs, essentially the most backward castes (MBCs). They are a part of the ongoing Bhaichara committee meetings to mobilise voters of the upper castes.\n“Zonal coordinators have been asked to bring in MBC cadres and rake up the issue of their being denied enough share in the reservation bracket under the OBC,“ said a senior BSP leader. – Pankaj Shah (TNN)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T07:02:48.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
