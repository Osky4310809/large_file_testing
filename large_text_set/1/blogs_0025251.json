The comparisons of Tyga’s resemblance to an actual tiger came rolling in. Tyga really cut tiger stripes into his head… \n— Buck Jr. (@_kelliieee) January 29, 2017 \nWith all due respect, this haircut deserves to be on the list of endangered species. One person thinks this was all an act of sabotage in order to get 21 Savage and Kylie Jenner together. Tyga's barber must be a 21 savage fan \n— Damien Darhkskin (@_MylesHigh) January 29, 2017 \nHonestly, this conspiracy theory doesn’t seem that far-fetched. Tyga’s haircut is basically the maze from “Westworld.” If Dolores finds the center of Tyga’s haircut, will she gain sentience? Tyga haircut look like a maze game pic.twitter.com/WbvRJ3KKa3 \nLet’s be real: This haircut choice is as confusing as the first season of “Westworld.” Tyga’s barber is equally to blame for this travesty. the worst part about tyga's hair cut is the fact that there's a barber out there that agreed to do that wack shit \n— Lil Morgg (@lilmorgg) January 29, 2017 \nThis is not the type of buzz you want to generate from your barbershop. Some people believed this haircut is the type of mistake you’d be likely to make in high school… not when you’re 27 fucking years old. Tyga damn near in his 30's rocking a high school haircut . Bye . I think we have some security footage of what went down in that barbershop… Tyga's new haircut pic.twitter.com/VTSfl1vUye \n— Ricky Fontaine (@JohnDoe863) January 30, 2017 \nBurn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T07:01:08.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
