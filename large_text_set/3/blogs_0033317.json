What’d I do at the crack of dawn, 8:58 AM? I aroused from a slumber dream where I was in the new Beauty and the Beast movie then rolled over and immediately checked my bank account, in a panic, to see if the huge influx of my direct deposit would allow me to afford my rent this month. I’m not great at “math” and “budgets” so I’m honestly still not totally sure. \n\nTom Brady? Well he woke up almost certainly in a villa looking out at the beach, he gently and quietly moved out from under Gisele Bundchen, so as not to stir her because he’s a gentleman, then checked his finances (rich people check finances, I check bank accounts), and you know what the real kicker here is? I bet he didn’t even notice. \n\nI bet Tom Brady got 14 million dollars (shut up about taxes again, I’ve addressed my math deficiencies so we’re sticking with headlines) and wasn’t sure if he got 14 million dollars. You know how sometimes you’ll check your account and try and figure out where something like 40 dollars came from/went? Tom does that with eight figures. That’s the kind of life he lives, the best life. \n\nPS – Our good friend Field Yates made a great point about this \n\n\n\nToday is absolutely not the best day of 2017 for Tom Brady. He got 14 million dollars and there’s a zero point zero percent chance he’s happier today than he was when he got that 5th Lombardi.
