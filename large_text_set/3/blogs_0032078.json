Think of putting a cat in a box of packing peanuts,” Dufek added. \nREAD MORE: Detecting alien life: NASA unveils test for organisms on distant planets \nWinds on Titan are far more gentle than here on planet Earth, but because of the density of the atmosphere on the moon, gusts would feel four times as powerful, potentially ending any dreams of humans windsurfing on lunar beaches. \nWhen combined with this electrostatically ‘sticky’ sand, any budding cosmic pioneers would spend more time cleaning their spaceship than they would exploring Titan’s liquid methane oceans and gigantic sand dunes. \n“Landforms are influenced by forces that aren’t intuitive to us because those forces aren’t so important on Earth. Titan is a strange, electrostatically sticky world,” Josef Dufek, the Georgia Tech professor who co-led the study said, as cited by Gizmodo. \nThe researcher's findings have been published in the journal, Nature Geoscience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:03:58.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
