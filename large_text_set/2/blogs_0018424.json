We didn't think so ...\nTurns out it TOTALLY happened ... and Donnell not only told the tale to TMZ Sports when we got him out at the Hollywood Improv Tuesday night -- he also provided VIDEO EVIDENCE!\nIt went down at a charity game in DC a few years back when Rawlings stole the ball from KD, then pushed the rock hard up the court to drain a smooth three.\nAlmost as dope as the moment itself? Donnell says he ran into Durant during All-Star Weekend in New Orleans and brought it up to him, and KD totally remembered.\nCheck it out below ... sorry we ever doubted you, Donnell.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/z7r4l79YZ6E?start=424&end=440&iv_load_policy=3&rel=0", "https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1119662925?pt=158118&ct=TMZ%20Sports%20Article%20Footer&mt=8"], "published": "2017-02-22T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:32:02.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
