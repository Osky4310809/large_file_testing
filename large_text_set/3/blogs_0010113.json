Lo and behold, the power cut out.\nIt happened midway through the singer's set in Adelaide, Australia. But being a professional ranter , Queen Adele kept the crowd entertained with an impromptu comedy routine. A very, very rude one.\nSEE ALSO: You will definitely LOL at Adele's alleged concert transportation trick \n\"Shall I tell you my filthy joke despite all the children here? I need more applause than that because I might offend someone,\" Adele told the crowd, according to news.com.au. \n\"What do you call a blonde standing on her head?\" she asked. *Drum roll* \"A brunette with bad breath.\" \nHmmm so @Adele says power has gone out under stage at Adelaide Oval. Now telling jokes while it's fixed. How apt...\n— Michael Owen (@mjowen) March 13, 2017 \nAdele then passed the microphone to a fan named Grant who had his own terrible joke, as per The Sun .\n\"Have you heard about the new restaurant on the moon? Apparently the food's great, but there's no atmosphere.\" Oh boy.\n\nAfter around five minutes, Adele apologised for the then-fixed power outage, explaining the blackout was due to her revolving stage pulling out the power cord for the instruments, and not those pesky power issues which have plagued the state of South Australia.\n\"I won't be revolving that stage again, will I? Thank you for your patience with my absolutely useless banter and thank you for putting up with some terrible jokes,\" she said.\nThe power has gone out underneath Adele's stage. #sapower pic.twitter.com/1OF3GgBbT4 \n— Rebecca Morse (@RebeccaMorse10) March 13, 2017 \nAside from awful jokes, Adele also confirmed she does indeed sit in a box in order to travel through the crow from backstage. \n\"Thank god the Australian press have outed me, because I'm not getting in that f*cking box again,\" she told the crowd. \n\"I've done 112 shows in that box, and it has been a nightmare. This time when I came out you all knew I was in it, I was scared ... I was frightened. So now, I'll just walk out of my room surprised going 'oh hello, hello!'\" \nMany'a fan would pay top dollar to hear some similarly strong Adele banter. \nWATCH: These flying robots will soothe your workday blues", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:35:29.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
