By: FE Online | Updated: February 22, 2017 3:55 PM Oria is constituency No. 221 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It is situated in Jalaun district and comes under Jalaun Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. (Source: PTI) \nUttar Pradesh is all set to witness its fourth phase of Assembly elections on February 23. Tight security arrangements are being made in 53 constituencies spread across 12 districts where the voting will take place. Districts going to polls in the fourth phase are Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur. Major parties to watch out for during this assembly polls are Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as they have put high stakes with an intention to form government with full majority. Over the past couple of months, UP has witnessed some high decibel rallies and roadshows. PM Narendra Modi , UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati has been the frontiers of their respective parties. The ongoing polls are touted to be a litmus test for the SP government as the party has recently came out from a family feud. PM Modi-led BJP stands tall as one of the strongest competitors for the ruling party. On one hand, where Akhilesh has managed to build an image of ‘leader for youth’ and have gained a huge vote bank in various regions of the state, some blame him for the law-and-order failure in the state. \nBJP’s star campaigner, PM Modi, during his surged campaigning spree has constantly targeted the SP-Congress alliance and the BSP for corruption in their regime. \nMaking it a crucial three-way contest, Mayawati-led BSP has cemented itself as one of lead contenders in this political run. However, the party is still behind in terms of vote bank apart from some particular communities. Even the votes of Muslim community have gone to her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. The high-octane assembly elections are in full swing in India’s most populous state and is expected to lay the cornerstone for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While SP aims at retaining its power, this time with the Congress, both BJP and BSP are fighting to make a comeback. \nOrai is constituency No. 221 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It is situated in Jalaun district and comes under Jalaun Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. \nNumber of voters Orai has a total of 2,37,444 registered voters. \nWhat are the key issues Drinking water, power, roads and law-and-order are some major issue of this region. \nWho was the winner last time SP won this constituency by a margin of 7,133 votes during the 2012 Assembly elections. Dayashankar from SP bagged 67,298 votes followed by Satyendra Pratap of BSP who got 60,165 votes. \nYou might also want to see this: \nWho are the competing candidates Vijay Chaudhari (BSP), Gauri Shankar (BJP), Mahendra Singh (SP) and Dwarika Prasad (SJP). \nWhy this constituency is important? As not much has been done for Orai by either of the political parties, its tough to say that whom the electorates will trust this time. Being a backward dominated region, BSP is the least preferred party as it did not do much for the area when it was in power. BJP might emerge as a ray of hope for many, but SP will is on toes to lure voters in this region.
