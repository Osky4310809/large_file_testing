But the public is not fully on board yet, Pelosi said, because \"many of the president's supporters are not ready to accept the fact that their judgement may not have been so great in voting for him.\" \nPelosi said by the time the case is made for impeachment, \"perhaps they will be ready to accept that.\" \nShe added, \"It's very hard, impeachment.\" \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

They also downplayed Trump's planned joint address on Tuesday night as, essentially, a big lie. \n\"It will be the usual bluster and blame,\" predicted Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. \"Populist platitudes will be a dime a dozen, but the focus should be on the president's actions rather than his empty words.\" \nSchumer and Pelosi accused Trump of formulating an agenda to benefit the rich at the expense of the working class. \nEarlier Monday, the White House signaled it would propose a budget that increases defense spending by $54 billion and makes cuts in domestic spending to make up the difference. \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested Republicans would simply make a 10 percent cut across the entire budget, which isn't likely. Such a move, Pelosi calculated, would result in cuts to job training, the National Institutes of Health and early childhood education, among other vital programs. Also from the Washington Examiner More have confidence in Trump than media: poll \nMore Americans have confidence in President Trump than in the news media, according to a new national poll of registered voters. \nThe poll, conducted by Fox News from Feb. 11-13, said that 53 percent of registered voters had either some confidence or a great deal of confidence in the president. That's compared to 44 percent who had confidence in the news media. \nA majority, 55 percent, said they had not much or no confidence in the news media. For Trump, it was 46 percent. \nThe numbers are fairly similar to those in 2014, the last time the same poll asked the same question. \nAsked then, 52 percent had a great deal or some confidence in the president, compared to 42 percent who said they had that level of confidence in", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:56:30.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
