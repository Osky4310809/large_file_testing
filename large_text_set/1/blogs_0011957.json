The Arewa youths, in a statement signed by their National President, Alhaji Yerima Usman Shettima said “the outcome of Lagos appeal will settle the matter once and for all,” saying that, “as the case stands now, the fate of the accused still hangs in the balance.” \nAccording to him, the final verdict would put the minds of all parties involved at rest for them to move on having seen that justice has been done properly. However, the group warned those influencing some sections of the media to misrepresent the pronouncement of the courts to desist from doing so, complaining that the tones of some media platforms yesterday gave cause for concern. \nThe Forum also accused some unnamed northern elites who he alleged were collaborating with their southern counterparts to malign a party to the case with a view to keeping him out of circulation permanently for no just cause. \n“If they continue with their diabolic tactics, the time to expose them is now, “ AYCF warned, saying, “we are keenly watching body movement of individuals and group of people who might attempt to pervert the cause of justice.” \nThe statement further stated that the Nigerian people now have utmost confidence in the Judiciary adding that, “we at the AYCF also hope that justice will be properly done at the end of the day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T08:39:20.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
