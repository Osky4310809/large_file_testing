The working area was as spacious and plush as should be expected in a state-of-the-art £757m football stadium; shooting England Under-21s’ curtain-raiser against Italy would present few major issues but it was an addition to the facilities that raised eyebrows. To some astonishment those present opened the doors on a fully-equipped darkroom, with sinks provided for the wet processing of films. It was a pristine setup with one flaw: there was absolutely no need for it, with the vast majority of its target users having long since switched to digital methods. \nThe speed of technological change had, in this case, outstripped what had often seemed a glacial rate of progress since Wembley was first identified as the new national stadium’s home in 1996. Yet in context it was more a quirk than a bump in the road and, a decade on, the impression is of a facility more comfortable in its own skin than when it opened its doors under a lingering cloud of debate about its financing and the very role it ought to play. Stunning: verdict as new Wembley opens Read more \nWembley’s opening, albeit 10 months later than its original target of the 2006 FA Cup final, had been far from a foregone conclusion until relatively late in the planning process. When Richard Caborn succeeded Kate Hoey as sports minister in June 2001 he was confronted with the tangled wreckage of a Football Association plan that, with a £120m Sport England grant at risk of falling into a black hole and ongoing arguments about whether the stadium could accommodate athletics, looked unworkable. \nHoey had clashed repeatedly with Ken Bates, chairman of FA subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL) before stepping down the previous December, who at one stage said she should be “shot” for “undermining” what had become an increasingly complicated scheme, and order needed restoring quickly. \n“We had to pick up the mess,” Caborn remembers of the situation he and Tessa Jowell, the then culture secretary, inherited. “Tessa and I agreed immediately to draw a line under the past and look to the future. There had been big rows, but if we’d started going into everything that had happened before it would never have been built. So we got the FA, ourselves and Sport England into a meeting and battled it out. There was little doubt that best practice hadn’t been applied previously, but if we wanted a stadium we just had to get on and do it. The main thing was to make sure it was a showpiece, and I think we managed that.” The main thing was to make sure it was a showpiece, and I think we managed that \nA look at the London skyline suggests Caborn is right and it serves, too, as evidence that the smallest details can make the greatest impact. As the project gathered a degree of speed, with work having begun in September 2002, WNSL began circulating glossy computer-generated images of the proposed end-product, including a rendering of the Norman Foster-designed arch illuminated strikingly in the night sky. \nThe problem, Wembley’s architects quickly pointed out, was that the picture was unrealistic: under the current plan, the arch would be lit only by uplighters from the stadium roof and the illumination would be dull. To achieve the effect WNSL had been advertising, a stretched budget would need flexing further for a stream of lights inside the structure itself. \n“I just thought: ‘Oh my God, we’re going to have to do that, that is going to be the iconic image,’” Michael Cunnah, chief executive of WNSL from 2001 until December 2006, says. “We were very tight for funding but we found the money to do it. I marvel at how they [the builder, Multiplex], achieved it with no light spill, which would have made it a blurred half-halo.” The new Wembley will host its 54th full international on Sunday when England face Lithuania. Photograph: Stephen Pond/PA \nFoster promised before the stadium opened that the arch would be “a more powerful symbol of the future than the old Wembley’s Twin Towers were of the past”. Perhaps more than any particular event or participant at Wembley, it has ingrained itself in the national consciousness. “It’s become our Eiffel Tower,” says Asif Burhan, who follows England at home and away. “Whenever there’s a big event in the news we look to the arch and see what colour it is. It’s like a symbol of our country now.” \nAs an expression of the nation’s world view, the sight of the arch coloured to match the French and Belgian flags after the terror attacks in those countries in the past 16 months was potent; this was the stadium capturing a solidarity that transcended sport and, perhaps, affirmed Foster’s vision. Football quiz: demolished stadiums Read more \nThe architectural positives may be appreciated but the sporting benefits take a little more time to eke out. When England face Lithuania on Sunday it will be their 54th full international at the new stadium; the old stadium staged 223 in 76 years and the question is whether, with few competitive matches that quicken the pulse and therefore little genuine opportunity to drum up an atmosphere, a little bit of the lustre diminishes with overfamiliarity. \n“There is a boredom factor at the games, especially given that before the stadium reopened England played matches all round the country,” Burhan says. “But I would say it’s probably got a broader, more diverse audience now; average attendances have grown and it’s letting more people in. When people come for the first time, you can see it is a jawdropping experience for them.” \nOpportunities for similar awe abound: Wembley is not exactly underused and the overrunning of costs – more than £85m a year at the end of last decade – is a contributing factor. On top of the staple events this year’s schedule includes FA Cup semi-finals, Anthony Joshua’s IBF world heavyweight bout against Wladimir Klitschko, an enhanced run of four NFL games and a four-night run of concerts by Adele. \nEven if the motives are largely financial – money has to be made, even though a refinancing of the stadium’s debt in 2015 means profitability is finally in sight – Wembley is now more accessible than ever. While £35 a head to watch Lithuania may not appeal to everybody, it is still cheaper than the average price of watching almost any of Gareth Southgate’s squad play in the Premier League. Nearly 82,000 were in situ for a turgid 2-0 win over Malta in October ; England command remarkable loyalty but the relative ease of attending games means fans will flock for the experience as much as the football.

If a stadium’s repute is born of a gradual buildup of history, myth and legend then the new ground remains reliant on the afterglow of its predecessor. Whether it can ever really assume a similar kind of character is debatable but the beginnings are there and heroes can still be made. It does not take much internet searching to find compilations of the best goals scored at the new Wembley and Gary Alexander, whose remarkable 30-yard volley for Millwall in the 2009 League One play-off final against Scunthorpe tops several of the charts, is an example of a relatively unheralded player who has found his name inextricably bound to the stadium. \n“If I go back to Millwall it’s the first thing people mention,” says Alexander, who now manages nearby Greenwich Borough. “I scored a few decent goals in my career but that one stands out because of the occasion and the venue. It’s every footballer’s dream and doesn’t matter whether you’re aspiring towards the Twin Towers, as I did when I was a boy, or the arch. Whether it’s old or new, it’s the national stadium and it’s where dreams come true.” Whether it’s old or new, it’s the national stadium and it’s where dreams come true \nAlexander recalls that a perforated eardrum almost ruled him out of the game and meant he could barely hear the roar of 40,000 Millwall supporters behind the goal as he celebrated; Wembley still provides uniquely coloured memories of vivid enough hue to be separated from more pragmatic concerns. \nThose include the future of the surrounding area. When one group of long-standing England fans attempted to book their usual table at the Blue Room, an Indian restaurant five minutes’ walk from the stadium, before the Lithuania match, they were dismayed to find it had closed: a casualty of fast-paced redevelopment. High-spec student residences tower to one side of Olympic Way; cranes reach into the sky on all four sides of the stadium and as apartment blocks spring up – the developer Quintain has delivered 1,000 new homes and 1,190 more are currently being constructed – an area that had previously escaped the widespread gentrification of London will soon assume the sheen of the stadium at its centre. Development around Wembley stadium has been fast-paced but did the FA miss a trick in that area? Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian \nThe FA missed a trick in that area, according to Caborn. “They should have bought the land around the stadium – we had some strong recommendations from English Partnerships that they did that,” he says. “It wasn’t done and it meant we weren’t able to get the best out of Wembley in terms of developing it in a holistic way, with community sports and similar initiatives. That was the downside: a lack of strategic planning and foresight.” \nCaborn believes Wembley’s end-product should be viewed as an overwhelming success story but believes the stadium’s cost – with that £120m lottery grant absorbed – still leaves an unseemly taste. \n“The FA got away with it, no doubt, in the sense that it was a lot of public money,” he says. “You’ve got to ask what the public got out of it, and whether it was right to use that money to help build a stadium given the riches in football. That is the big question: have they got value for money? Probably in terms of the international prestige around it, yes, but in terms of the public purse, no.” \nBy the time Wembley hosted its most prestigious events of all, the Champions League finals of 2011 and 2013 , its status as a world-class venue had been underlined and any early rough edges smoothed out. The darkroom, never used, has been turned over for storage. However it got here, Wembley is – in Foster’s words – “going to be around for “70 to 100 years”, and for all the misgivings and ambiguities it appears the country has become used to it.
