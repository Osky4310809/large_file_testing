Jackson when you need him?\nPassengers on an Alaskan flight were freaked out after it was discovered there was some loose cargo on board: an actual live snake!\nLocal press reported that the pale snake was spotted during the 90-minute Ravn Alaska flight between Aniak and Anchorage on Sunday.\nVideo: Steve Irwin's Son Freaks Out Jimmy Fallon With A Snake! \nPassenger Anna McConnaughy told KTVA the pilots informed passengers that a snake was loose about 15 minutes after takeoff. The snake was spotted moments later by a boy in the last row, who found the snake curled up under a carry-on bag near his seat.\nThe flight attendant was the real MVP, jumping into action and scooping up the snake (with her hands!!) before putting it in a trash bag.\nAirline spokesperson William Walsh said the passenger had violated policy in bringing the (motherfuckin') snake on the (motherfuckin') plane, saying in a statement:\n\"For the purpose of preserving cabin safety for the greater traveling public, Ravn Alaska prohibits all rodents, ferrets, reptiles, snakes, insects or any type of venomous or poisonous creature from being used as an emotional support animal.\"\nA snake as an emotional support animal? What emotions does this reptile support other than evolutionary-based fear!?\nWe're glad there were no injuries, and hope none of these poor passengers has PTSD from the surprise snake disturbance.\nThe rep did not confirm what breed of snake was on board, but the animal looks to be at least four to five feet long from the photos.\nCh-ch-check out more pics (below)! \n\n[ Image via KTVA . ] \nTags: alaska , flight , reptile friends , samuel l. jackson , scary! , snake , viral: animals", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T07:24:09.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
