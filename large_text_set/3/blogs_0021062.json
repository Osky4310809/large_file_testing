The team adjusted his workload and he played through the remainder of the year, but he underwent MRIs and the injury was closely monitored. \n“We developed a plan for Cam to take a period of rest, a period of rehabilitation and treatment, and then start a gradual throwing program the first part of March,” Panthers head athletic trainer Ryan Vermillion told the team's official website. “Cam started his program, and the early parts of his rehab had been going well. However, as we worked to advance him into the next stage – the strengthening stage, the throwing stage – he started to have an increase in his pain level and started having pain while throwing. \n“As a result, Dr. Pat Connor (head team physician) felt the most prudent procedure would be to arthroscopically repair the shoulder.\" \nComing off an MVP campaign and Super Bowl berth the previous season, Newton set a career low with a 52.9% completion rate in 2016. He threw for 3,509 yards and 19 touchdowns with 14 interceptions. \nNewton also had career lows in rushing attempts (90) and yards (359). Panthers coach Ron Rivera has said throughout this offseason he wants to have Newton run less often, in part to reduce the number of hits he takes. \nThe Panthers also announced defensive end Charles Johnson (back) and wide receiver Damiere Byrd (knee) are expected to undergo procedures that will sideline them for a similar amount of time. \nPHOTOS: Notable NFL players on the move Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
