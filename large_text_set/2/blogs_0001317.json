Wade, a landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, according to critics. The majority of Coloradans support abortion, and “Colorado cannot trust him,” Ozols said. \nAbout 25 people gathered outside the Byron White Courthouse in Denver, where the Appeals Court is located, on Thursday to rail against the nomination, which follows almost a year during which Republicans refused to consider former U.S. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to the high court. \n“The majority Republicans never even met with Garland, meanwhile, (Sen. Cory Gardner) met with Gorsuch the day after the nomination,” said Ian Silverii, executive director of ProgressNow Colorado. \nTo be confirmed, Gorsuch must win a simple majority of senators. But 60 senators must agree to hold an up-or-down vote, and Republicans have only 52 seats. \nRepublicans can change the rules using the so-called nuclear option to allow confirmation without the up-or-down vote. But that would eliminate the use of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in the future, when Democrats might be faced with a nominee they find even more objectionable. \nSome of the demonstrators said Senate Democrats should unite to block his appointment, even if that means Republicans do away with the filibuster. \n“From our perspective, they couldn’t pick a worse justice than Gorsuch,” said Stephen Justino, of Colorado Move to Amend, a group formed to fight corporate and financial influence in elections.
