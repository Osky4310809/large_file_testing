However, it was later revealed that he had not shown up for the tests. \nRegarding this, a source from G.Soul’s side explained, “He applied to enlist as a conscripted policeman, but he changed his mind and decided to enlist as an active-duty soldier. He is very intent on doing so and will wait for the right timing to serve in the military.” Various sources are predicting that he will enlist sometime this year. \nIn Korea, enlisting as a conscripted policeman is sometimes perceived as an attempt to take it easy in the military, whereas enlisting as an active-duty soldier gives the impression that you are fully serving for your country. In reality, both are official and valid methods of completing one’s military duty. \nA source from G.Soul’s agency JYP Entertainment clarified on February 24, “He did not apply to enlist as a conscripted policeman in order to take it easy. Conscripted policemen are also soldiers, and it seems that there was a mistake when the news was publicized. He did not take the physical examinations to be a conscripted policeman because he was searching for an alternative way to enlist as an active-duty soldier.” \nMeanwhile, G.Soul is releasing a song titled “Fire Water” with Code Kunst and Epik High’s Tablo on February 28.
