New Zealand is famous for its incredible, out-of-this world landscapes (as made famous in ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù). To recreate the story‚Äôs fantasy world, filmmakers decided to shoot near Lake Hawea in Wanaka. \nIt‚Äôs a beautiful enough destination on its own, but on break between shoots, the famous trio has begun to explore the country. \nJust hanging out ... üòâüí™üèº‚õ∞‚ú® with @mollyrstern & @amgtexas. #YogaRetreat #NewZealand Thank you @aroharetreats! \nA post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 21, 2017 at 5:42pm PST \nWitherspoon escaped to attend a yoga retreat on South Island. She chose Aro Ho Wellness Retreats, a luxury resort overlooking Lake Wakatipu. \nA post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 21, 2017 at 12:45am PST \nAnd went horseback riding. \nHappy Sunday! ‚òÄÔ∏èsoaking up the sun in gorgeous #newzealand üá≥üáø Hope you are having a beautiful day! \nA post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Feb 18, 2017 at 11:39pm PST \nBut because a trip becomes much more fun when you ignore wellness for a bit, Witherspoon also made a stop in New Zealand wine country. She chose to stop at Amisfield Winery in Central Otago for a glass of pinot noir. \nA post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 21, 2017 at 1:54pm PST \nMeanwhile, Kaling has been Instagramming and sharing the magnificent New Zealand sky with her followers. \nA post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 17, 2017 at 10:41pm PST \nShe also made time for a lakeside hot-tub soak with wine. \nA post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 14, 2017 at 2:22pm PST \nKaling also explored Mount Creighton on South Island. \nA post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Feb 21, 2017 at 12:35am PST \nAnd, of course, no trip is complete with experiencing the local cuisine. \nA post shared by Oprah (@oprah) on Feb 15, 2017 at 12:27pm PST \nAs for Oprah, she is taking in the natural landscapes of New Zealand. \nA post shared by Oprah (@oprah) on Feb 16, 2017 at 7:19pm PST \nShe is especially a fan of Lake Hawea. \n#WrinkleInTime has landed in New Zealand!
