The hit AMC series makes room for everything from pregnancy woes to hot-and-fast romance. For fans, The Walking Dead pads its gory kill scenes with heart-wrenching drama, and the addictive combo keeps them coming back for more. Not long ago on the show, a huge mystery on The Walking Dead was finally addressed - but it looks like one star disagrees with its solution. \nEarlier in season seven, fans listened as Rick Grimes told Michonne about someone he used to know. The downtrodden leader told his lover he used to have a friend named Shane who shacked up with his late wife Lori when the walkers sent civilization into chaos. Rick learned about the pair’s affair after he reunited with the group at the show’s beginning, but fans never felt as if the relationship ever fully ended. The memory of Shane lingered because Lori discovered she was pregnant not long after reuniting with Rick, leaving fans unsure as to who Judith’s father was. \nAccording to Rick and The Walking Dead as a whole, the baby’s real father is none other than Shane. Rick admits that to Michonne without hesitation. But, for the actress who played Lori, she would care to challenge that assessment. \nSpeaking to CinemaBlend , Sarah Wayne Callie was asked how she felt about The Walking Dead ’s revelation with Judith. It was there that actress admitted she hadn’t heard it happened, but she stands firm with her belief that Rick is Judith’s real dad. \n“You know, I get asked a lot of whose baby it is, and my answer is always, 'It's Rick's, because a man who stands up to raise a baby is that baby's father.' I have a unique perspective on this. My son is adopted and my husband is my son's father. They don't look a thing alike. They're a different race. They don't have the same DNA. Anybody who has kids, I think, would recognize that none of that matters. What matters is who stands up for this kid, and Rick has stood up for this kid, and that makes Judith his daughter. Nothing else matters.” \nJoking, Callies went on to say she and the rest of the cast thought up a funny way to confirm Judith’s parentage. “We always had the joke that if Judith grows up and has a big honkin' nose that looks like it's been broken in six sites, that answers the question,” she said. \nSorry, Jon Bernthal. You may be considered Judith’s biological father by the show, but Lori isn’t having any of it apparently. \nThe Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on AMC.
