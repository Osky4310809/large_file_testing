Perry Saturn is facing homelessness , Tugboat went to the hospital , and Jimmy Snuka passed away over the weekend . For MLK Day, we could all use a bit of a pick-me-up and a feel-good story.\nThat’s where Jarrius “JJ” Robertson comes in. Jarrius was born in 2002 and has been fighting life-threatening illnesses and organ failures almost since the moment he was born. He has spent the past few years inspiring others with his story and with his foundation, It Takes Lives To Save Lives . He was “basically adopted” by the New Orleans Saints as one of their biggest fans and has been a local NOLA celebrity for some time. Now, thankfully, he’s here to make all of our lives better by interviewing WWE stars.\nAt last week’s press event for WWE announcing their return to New Orleans for WrestleMania 34, Jarrius got a chance to interview a whole bevy of Superstars, and he stole the whole damn show. From putting money on Alexa Bliss, to nailing a picture-perfect New Day hip gyration, you can tell that he instantly became the favorite media personality of everyone in the room. Sorry, Renee Young.\n\nThe person who obviously got clowned the worst was The Miz, as he generally tends to be.\nBut it’s not all about video content. Jarrius has bars on Twitter, too. Might want to break out a hankie for the last one, though. Just a heads up.\n\nmy Buddy @WWERomanReigns with the reaction of a dude who knows i look better in the @wwe belt than he does pic.twitter.com/DDeWw7Hpdj \n— Jarrius Robertson (@Jarrius) January 11, 2017 \nalways leave them smiling \nIt makes your world a happier place pic.twitter.com/oCh8jqT13p \n— Jarrius Robertson (@Jarrius) January 12, 2017 \n#wcw thx u @StephMcMahon for making yesterday a day I will never forget pic.twitter.com/NwccHu4efq \n— Jarrius Robertson (@Jarrius) January 11, 2017 \n\nAnd if you were wondering whether there was anyone the Smackdown Women’s Championship could look bigger on than Alexa Bliss … look no further.\nTHE CHAMP IS HERE @AlexaBliss_WWE @WrestleMania pic.twitter.com/JolsBS1foc \n— Jarrius Robertson (@Jarrius) January 10, 2017 \n\nHere’s hoping JJ replaces Peter Rosenberg as the host of Bring It To The Table by the time WrestleMania 34 rolls around. No offense, Pete. JJ’s just got the goods.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T00:09:48.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
