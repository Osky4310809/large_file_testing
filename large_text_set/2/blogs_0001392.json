Passionate about #techforgood and #cs4all **opinions are my own** 10 mins ago Techies respond to Friday’s immigration ban A woman’s place is in the resistance After my last post , I told myself: “I should make my next post more fun, not so indignant.” Then we all had the worst fucking week imaginable, and it’s all I can think about. Turns out- the rest of the tech world is feeling the same thing. Rarely have I seen tech workers so united in action. Not to perpetuate stereotypes, but we’re not exactly a community that enjoys large crowds, public speaking or really anything that involves being outside of either the office or our homes (special exceptions often made for board game night). Chances are this last election cycle became personal for you long before January 20th. Maybe it was when it was suddenly acceptable for presidential candidates to make fun of those living with disabilities, or to call an entire country “criminals and drug dealers,” maybe it was when OUR NOW PRESIDENT ACTUALLY JOKED ABOUT GRABBING WOMEN’S VAGINAS WITHOUT ASKING. Like he actually talked about how you don’t need consent- but I digress. An incredible amount of awful shit happened last week, and then, ON HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY , it got even worse. FUCK. THIS. SHIT. Trump signed an executive order barring Syrian refugees from asylum in the US and IMMEDIATELY barred entry of citizens of 7 predominantly Muslim countries. ( new york times article ) The world was outraged, airports were descended upon by angry activists; thousands of people just SAT DOWN in the middle of downtown Seattle because what the fuck else do you do? Thousands of protesters sit in downtown Seattle via www.facebook.com While so many awful things have been happening, this hit extra close to home because, perhaps surprisingly, I am an immigrant. Yes me, white, blonde, English speaking. In fact, not only am I an immigrant- I am a green card holder (i.e., not a citizen yet). My closest friends, my family, and a huge percentage of my industry- we are all immigrants. Whenever candidates ask me that typically meaningless question “what do you like most about working at Microsoft?” my answer is simple and wholeheartedly sincere “the people.” I tell them how I get to work with the smartest hustlers out there, and it stretches me to be the best I can be every single day. More often than not, the best hustlers are immigrants. Microsoft employees who leave their homes, uproot their families and move across the world to a foreign place to work with us. Every day I get the privilege to work with those that changed their whole lives just to come work here. This company, just like our country, is BUILT on immigration. Just take it from our CEO (spoiler: he’s an immigrant) Today Brad Smith sent email to Microsoft employees. I want to highlight this piece in particular: \"As a company… www.linkedin.com It should be clear why immigration is especially personal for the tech industry. And some may say the order “isn’t that bad,” but as immigrants, we know what it feels like to be told “you’re not wanted here.” Tech is family, and we absolutely will not stand for you coming for our family. Thankfully, we know when it’s time to unite against bullshit. Last year when North Carolina passed it’s “bathroom bill” we as a community collectively said “HELL NO.” Business leaders sent a letter of their disapproval , ultimately leading to a boycott which has cost North Carolina $400 million . The time has come again for tech to band together. Within hours of the executive order tech leaders made their opposition CLEAR : CEO of Dropbox Foundner and former Google CEO, general bad ass CEO of Salesforce who has no interest in hiding behind sanitized professional language Shout out to the platform that is helping keep these conversations democratized However we didn’t stop there. Tech is doing whatever it can to support those affected: CEO speaking on behalf of Lyft CEO speaking on behalf of Airbnb Even more importantly- tech has already committed to putting its enormous resources towards overturning this insane policy. Tech companies are joining forces with the Washington state government to fight against Donald Trump's recent… www.theverge.com I am beyond proud that I get to work for a company that will resist even a president to stand up for their employees. I am equally as happy that every goddamn dollar I donate to the ACLU is matched by Microsoft thanks to our amazing Give benefits. Unfortunately , there are some members of the tech community who have chosen to work in close collaboration with the Trump administration- and over the weekend we descended upon them. Elon Musk , founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, fellow immigrant, and tech industry golden child has taken a position as Trump’s tech adviser. In response to the ban he has been tweeting interesting thoughts like this: To be thorough, I did take Elon’s advice and read the whole executive order . Guess what- it is that bad. It clearly discriminates against Muslims by offering preferential treatment to “refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality” — read “let the Christians in”. Ok, ok, maybe he was just advocating for the public to rely on facts not opinions. Right? Well then he tweeted the WEAKEST SHIT OF ALL TIME He might have just said “the travel ban isn’t great, but I am gonna make a shit ton of money working with Trump”. Elon has claimed to be our voice to the new administration, he even tweeted that he wants our feedback! Asking angry internet users for direct feedback is generally a good idea, right? I hope that is working out for you Elon . The industry is pissed . Engineers are data oriented, obsessive and we spend a lot of time on the internet. Be careful- the nerds are watching. I an effort to end on a positive note here are my personal commitments to doing what I can: For every “recommend” on this post I will donate $1 to the ACLU and $1 to the International Rescue Committee . And, because awesome, Microsoft will match both my donations. I will continue to teach tech skills to students all across the globe (including rural America as well as any Muslim majority country), for free . In fact- that is my literal job at Microsoft. If you are interested please check out our online courses at https://www.edx.org/school/microsoft and https://mva.microsoft.com/ I will continue to teach computer science and entrepreneurship skills to Seattle students in the hopes that they never feel left out of our economy or public discourse. Maybe even some day these students will find themselves in a position of power to stand up to unjust policies. And finally- what I have been saying I will do for years, but I have put off and put off because frankly, as a white woman it wasn’t critically important- I will get my citizenship. This year! Yes, that means my citizenship papers will have Donald Trump’s signature on them, but it also means come midterm elections a ballot will have my signature on them for the first time. Stay tuned for epic America themed celebrations. Have an immigration story to share? Is your company doing something to response to the ban? Share below.
