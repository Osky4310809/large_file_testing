Havard Nordtveit scores an own goal (Photo: Toby Melville/Reuters) \nReid 4 - Like Nordveit some good, decisive blocks early on but gave up after the first two. \nOgbonna 3 - Unlucky to concede the soft spot-kick that started the house crashing down. \nCresswell 3 - Bypassed on way too many occasions by Silva, Sagna and Sterling. \nFernandes 3 - Unable to stop City, who grew in confidence, dominating out wide. Edimilson Fernandes in action (Photo: Arfa Griffiths) \nObiang 3 - City had far too much craft and creativity for him in midfield \nFeghouli 3 - Missed a sitter at 1-0 that could have changed the course of the game. \nLanzini 4 - Not at his best but, to be fair, a difficult night for the whole team. \nAntonio 4 - Forced Cabellero into a save in the first half but unable to hurt City after.

Lots of authority in defence. \nZabaleta 8 - A rare start in midfield and did well, even enjoyed an effort on goal. \nToure 8 - Brilliant from the spot as usual. In charge in midfield alongside Zabaleta. \nSterling 9 MOTM - Made a goal, forced an own goal and ran rings around the Hammers.

Sat Adrian on his backside before scoring at his leisure. \nDe Bruyne 7 - Not at his dominant best but still too good for this West Ham side. \nAguero 7 - Back in the saddle with his second half goal.
