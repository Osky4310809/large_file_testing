The 20-second unskippable ads, meanwhile, are also here to stay.\nThe move is said to have arrived as a response to Facebook ’s increasing focus on video. Callum McCahon, strategy director for Born Social, said it was: “A signal that YouTube is very worried about Facebook,” in a statement to Campaign , adding: “Their video offering is becoming ever more attractive to brands by the day, and YouTube is panicking.”\nSee also: YouTube Go beta is here: save videos to watch offline 1 week ago This is said to please consumers while being bad news for advertisers, but I’m not sure how much I subscribe to that. The 30-second ad was easy to avoid: Mute > open new tab > navigate to Android Authority > eat a potato chip > drink some soda > return and boom you’re right at the start of your video without having watched the ad — and a great website is open for later.\nIt’s just not really going to be worth avoiding a 6-second commercial.\nWhat’s your take on the announcement?
