Thanks,” he said. \nBut the entire saga took a twist on Wednesday as the Information Officer rebuffed repeated calls to his cell phone. \nWhen he was called with a number not known to him, he picked the call, but as soon as he discovered that the call was from The PUNCH, he became hostile. \nHe said, “ABU is not a motor park institution. We have ways of checking our systems for facts and records on such an issue. If your newspaper wants any information on the Melaye issue or any issue at all, you can write the vice-chancellor,” he said. \nWhen reminded that he had promised that the university’s management would meet on the matter on Wednesday and give its position on Melaye’s academic status concerning his BSc degree in Geography, Mohammed declined and hung up. \nBut feelers from ABU indicated that the authorities were still meeting as regards the Melaye case. \nA top source at the institution, who pleaded not to be named, said there appeared to be a problem with the senator’s Bachelor’s degree in Geography, adding that the management was being careful because of the political implication of the matter. \nAnother source, however, told our correspondent that the ‘social media’ report on the issue was unreliable. \n“What I can tell you is that I know that the senator in the eye of the storm, I think, he did his Master’s in International Relations and Diplomacy (MIAD) in the university and ABU, as an organised university, cannot admit any student without a first degree to study for a postgraduate degree. \n“But I don’t know whether he used the BSc degree in Geography to apply for admission or not. For me, I don’t see anything wrong in the university issuing a statement to clear the air on the matter,” the source stated. \nMeanwhile, Melaye has expressed his intension to drag an online news medium, Sahara Reporters, before a court on Thursday. \nMelaye wants to sue for defamation and will be demanding N5bn compensation from Sahara Reporters. \nThis is despite that the fact that the Senate, on Tuesday, decided to investigate the allegation based on a point of order raised by a former Majority Leader of the Senate, Senator Ali Ndume, calling for a probe into the scandal. \nMelaye’s intension to take legal action against the news medium was made known on Wednesday when he invited the Senate Press Corps to a Federal Capital Territory High Court sitting in Abuja to cover the filing of the litigation. \nSahara Reporters had, in a report, alleged that Melaye did not graduate from the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Kaduna State, adding that he was parading a fake certificate. \nBut Melaye had, on Tuesday, said he was ready for the probe by the Senate. \nHe said, “I am here to respond to the issue raised by Senator Ali Ndume. I want to say, to me, it is a welcome development. Democracy is about investigation and no senator is above investigation. To me, it is a welcome development and it will finally clear the air on all the malicious and vindictive allegations. \n“To say that I did not graduate from ABU is to say that I am not a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. ABU is a very prestigious university in this country and it is not possible for one to be running a master’s programme in the university when one did not graduate from a university. I have successfully completed one and I am doing the second one.” \nCopyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
