Dallas WR Brice Butler was hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct flag after joining the huddle then not participating in the play, which cost his team 37 yards. This is apparently an unsportsmanlike penalty on Brice Butler: https://t.co/zceAkuw2zT pic.twitter.com/AOI7lLWyxf — SB Nation (@SBNation) January 15, 2017 The rule regarding illegal substitution says that if a sub enters and gets inside the numbers he must participate for play. — Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) January 15, 2017 \nThe penalty makes sense. Defenses match-up based on the personnel in the huddle, so attempting to confuse the coaches in the booth by running players in and out would create an unfair advantage for the offense. It's still an unfamiliar rule that confused NFL twitter. Someone had to come up with that penalty at some point in football history. \"What if a guy runs on the field and then leaves? I hate that.\" — Chris Burke (@ChrisBurke_SI) January 15, 2017 All this league needs is about 289 more rules to really lure new viewers. — Tyler Dunne (@TyDunne) January 15, 2017 Raise your hand if you've heard of that penalty before. — The MMQB (@theMMQB) January 15, 2017 Good and very reasonable that coming into the huddle and leaving is the same yardage penalty as an illegal helmet hit — Mike Tunison (@xmasape) January 15, 2017 Being on the field for the actual play illegally is a 5 yd penalty... being in the huddle before it's even called?
