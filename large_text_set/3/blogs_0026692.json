Gernot Rohr \n“He should be looking for every positives and he should also be able to identify the not so good things in the team which he will be able to work on before the competitive games,” Adepoju said. \n“To be factual, I have not seen those players [Tyrone Ebuhehi and Joel Bazee-Noah] play before but from references, I believe they are good players, and that was why they were invited. \n“I also believe the coach will see good things in them, but we are looking at how they can adapt to the Nigerian system and how they are able to add value to the team. \n“In a friendly game, I think it is ideal for the coach to want to see where he is lacking and will want to cover up with new players, so I think it’s ideal for him to be able to see some players he has not seen before.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:25:22.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
