The President added that the natural resources found in Mindanao could be fully utilized if corruption and criminality brought by illegal drugs would be eradicated. Rey Baniquet/Presidential Photo MANILA, Philippines — Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo on Tuesday denied reports that the survivors of the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Surigao were asked to wait for President Rodrigo Duterte before relief goods were distributed to them. “There was never an order to delay the release of relief goods to the people and to wait for President Rodrigo Duterte’s arrival before the distribution can begin,” Taguiwalo said in a statement. RELATED: Officials step up aid distribution in quake-hit Surigao after complaints on slow response “The relief operations in Surigao last weekend was not the first of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) under my watch or under the Duterte administration – we never want those who need help to wait for it,” she added. The secretary said neither Duterte nor the DSWD are in the habit of keeping the people wait for relief goods, noting that no such issue came out during the previous relief operations in Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela, Catanduanes or Albay. She said that their field office has immediately activated its quick response team hours after the quake hit Surigao del Norte and nearby provinces on Friday night. “I immediately asked DSWD field office officer-in-charge Mita Lim to distribute water and to closely coordinate with the local government units regarding the release of DSWD relief goods we had prepositioned with them,” she said. Duterte and other Cabinet officials including Taguiwalo went to earthquake-affected areas on Sunday. Several reports online claimed that the survivors were made to wait for Duterte before the relief goods were distributed, an allegation Taguiwalo denied. However, she admitted difficulties in the immediate release of the goods from the DSWD, citing that local government units are delegated as first responders during calamities. “Given (this), in the case of Surigao, we were not immediately able to set up and implement an effective distribution system” she said. “We sought to remedy this as soon as possible when we conducted meetings with DSWD Caraga officials, the officials of the Surigao LGU, and barangay captains. Since Sunday, we have been distributing relief goods as well as water,” added Taguiwalo. She also explained why beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) were the first to receive the relief goods. “This is the first immediate response of the field office because beneficiaries of the 4Ps program affected by the earthquake are easy to verify and validate,” said Taguiwalo. “There is no truth, however, that we are helping 4Ps beneficiaries only: DSWD’s relief goods and calamity assistance give priority to the poorest and most affected citizens affected by calamities regardless of whether they are 4Ps beneficiaries or not,” added the secretary. She said that DSWD officials from the central office are still in Surigao to assist in the relief distribution and determine possible measures that can be implemented to improve the system of distribution and storage of relief goods. “We learn ways to improve our processes with every calamity that strikes. We do not ignore or deny the flaws and weaknesses in our system because to do so will prevent us from putting together steps to correct them,” said Taguiwalo. “Our goal is to provide relief assistance to Filipinos as soon as possible when they need it. The local government units are the first responder, yes – but the DSWD also actively coordinates with them so we can provide augmentation support as soon as it is needed,” she added.
