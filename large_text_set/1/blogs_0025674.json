Belichick said Monday in an interview with WEEI’s “Dale & Holley” he was relieved to go through a Super Bowl week without having to discuss “science experiments.” \nBut that doesn’t mean the week will be devoid of distractions for New England. Belichick and Brady surely will be asked about their friendship with President Donald Trump , and the whole team will begin the week by enduring the media bonanza that is Super Bowl Opening Night. \n“Yeah, I think we all know this is a circus without the trapeze and the dancing elephants,” Belichick told “Dale & Holley,” via MassLive.com. “It’ll be the media night unlike any other, except at this event. But we’ll embrace it and enjoy it. It’s just part of the week.” \nThe Patriots’ portion of Opening Night (formerly known as Media Day) is scheduled to run from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET. \nThumbnail photo via Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T09:34:02.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
