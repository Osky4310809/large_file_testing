Even my picky eater raved about it. Served with corn muffins and hit the spot on a chilly Fall evening. Excellent recipe!\" MY REVIEW gadget_pa User ID: 75216 255999 Reviewed Oct. 27, 2016 \n\"I used three 11.5 oz cans of tomato juice and two 11.5 oz cans of V8 juice (total 57.5 oz). I like more broth. I did not add salt and pepper, but had it available on the table when serving.\" MY REVIEW AmyE007 User ID: 6828226 255804 Reviewed Oct. 23, 2016 \n\"Simple to make. We used spicy V8 and the flavor was good. This soup smelled delicious today cooking in the crockpot on a cool fall day. I did add some noodles towards the end....beware, the noodles soak up the fluid and turn this into a thick stew. Next time we will leave the noodles on the side and stir in just before serving. This does make a big batch.\" MY REVIEW Mudderfly77 User ID: 3168574 255351 Reviewed Oct. 12, 2016 \n\"This was SO easy to make and simply delicious. My boyfriend and I are trying to lose weight, so we've been focusing on high protein and veggies for every meal with minimal carbs. My aunt used to make a soup very similar to this that I loved, (she paired it with homemade cornbread) and with the cool weather rolling in I decided to try this recipe tonight. I followed the recipe closely except like others, I doubled the hamburger meat to 2 lbs, and cooked with a chopped onion. I thoroughly drained the fat from the meat, added 4 cloves of fresh crushed garlic as well as a small can of roasted tomatoes (drained) for more heft. My veggies of choice are green beans and corn, so I added a 16 oz frozen bag of each. My boyfriend is picky, but not only did he say \"this is very good\" several times, he ate 3 bowls in one hour! We topped it with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese...yum! Next time we will try it with the spicy V8 for a kick.\" MY REVIEW JGa2595176 User ID: 496732 255289 Reviewed Oct. 11, 2016 \n\"Blew-us-away! This is such an easy, super tasty soup . Our entire family (adults and kids alike) loved this. Made as directed, although saw some folks added more ground beef or spices to their version. Next time may experiment, but we really enjoyed as is.\" MY REVIEW ccmcc User ID: 2063578 255253 Reviewed Oct. 10, 2016 \n\"I have made this soup a couple of times, simmering it on the stove top for about an hour in lieu of the slow cooker . My husband and I love it because it reminds us of the simple soup we both grew up with. As others, I used 2 lbs of ground beef, cooked, rinsed and drained. I use healthy Request Cream of Mushroom because of its reduced fat and sodium. We liike Westpac Classic soup Vegetables because among the other veggies, they include okra and lima beans, (Can't stand green beans in soup !) Someday will include macaroni, but for now we serve with Pepperidge Farm 5 Cheese bread so don't need the macaroni.\" MY REVIEW Mininunu User ID: 8844194 253810 Reviewed Sep. 7, 2016 \n\"I made this today. Delicious! I made a few modifications, as suggested in the comments. I used spicy V8, used 2 pounds of ground beef, cooked 2 medium chopped onions with the beef, added a can of tomatoes, and a big ol' spoon of garlic. Very easy. Very tasty. Will definitely add to the line up.\" MY REVIEW afish2000 User ID: 6550558 243571 Reviewed Feb. 10, 2016 \n\"I have not made this yet but, I intend to. I was reading the comments and will take some into consideration. I have to reply t, MIZER. If you're going to call someone a name such as the one you used, at least spell that name correctly. Soo, who's the, 'butthole' now? Too funny!\" MY REVIEW MIZER User ID: 83546 243561 Reviewed Feb. 9, 2016 Edited Feb. 10, 2016 \n\"shereeder you are an butthole. Would use another word but it wont let me. afish 2000 you can kiss my butt hole.\" MY REVIEW shereeder User ID: 1853566 235584 Reviewed Oct. 25, 2015 \n\"I haven't tried it yet but will rate it 4 stars because you use cream of fungus soup . I think I'd substitute maybe cream of potato or cream of celery. Yes, and I'll fry my hamburger and onions together for more flavor. I have my own canned tomato juice that will be most excellent in it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T07:14:54.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
