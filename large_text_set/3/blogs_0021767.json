She had to pick a chit which had a celebrity's name and it turned out to be, well, Anushka Sharma herself. \n\"I danced on the song ' Jiya Re ' from Jab Tak Hai Jaan ,\" Mehreen laughs recounting the story. \"Ever since, I was hoping that I would get a chance to work with Anushka. I believe in fairy tales. I'm living one right now. Three years later, after six rounds of auditions in early 2016, I finally got a call. It was while I was watching Tom McCarthy's Spotlight. I had to come to Mumbai and meet Anushka Sharma, who's one of the producers of Phillauri . Suddenly, I felt like I was under a spotlight.\" A still from Phillauri trailer. Mehreen Pirzada in the film. \nAsk her if Anushka knows this story, Mehreen beams with joy saying, \"Yes. When I shared my story with her, she was surprised. And then, she told me that a long time ago, her mother had written a chit where she wished that her daughter should act in a Yash Raj film when she grows up. Finally, when she bagged Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi , her mother showed her the chit. I couldn't help but blush when she told me this story.\" \nIn Phillauri , Mehreen plays Anu, a young woman who is about to get married to her childhood sweetheart Kanan, played by Suraj Sharma. When he's told that he's mangalik and has to get married to a tree to ward off evil, he ends up meeting a friendly spirit Shashi (Anushka Sharma). The film is, in a way, a study on how love is the same no matter what the time frame is. \"The story constantly keeps going back and forth. Anshai Lal and writer Anvita Dutt have weaved an interesting story about how love doesn't change even though time changes,\" the actress adds. \nBeing the youngest member of the cast, she admits to being quite pampered on the sets of Phillauri . \n\"I was the youngest and newest member of the team. All my co-stars - Anushka, Diljit Dosanjh and Suraj Sharma are well-established, but never made me feel out of place. I'm very critical of my own work and want to deliver my best. One time, when I was quite upset that I didn't get a shot right, and Anushka got to know that I cried the whole night. The next day she came and hugged me and said, ' Arey pagliâ€¦kya hua tujhe ? Why were you crying? We're all there for you.' \n\"I didn't expect such a sweet gesture from her. She treated me like her own sister. The best thing about her is that she is quite straight forward as a person\" said Mehreen. \nHaving grown up in Punjab, before her family moved to Canada, Mehreen is well-versed with the nuances of the Punjabi culture; however, she disagrees that it was a major factor behind why she bagged the role. \"We are actors and the only thing that matters is how much we soak in the characters and make them our own. I act in Telugu films and when I'm shooting there, I'm a Telugu girl,\" she avers. \nSo, does she have plans to go back to Canada in near future? \"Only if I have to shoot there,\" she laughs, adding, \"I'm really glad that I spent the formative years of my life in USA and Canada. It has helped shape my personality. Back there, you are on your own and you do things to make yourself happy, not others.\" \nThe actress made her debut in Telugu cinema in early 2016 with Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema Gadha in which she played Nani's romantic interest. Despite the success of the film, she had to wait for nearly 10 months to bag her next project and currently, she's on a roll with as many as five Telugu and Tamil films to her credit. \nSays Mehreen, \"I was going through a low phase after making my acting debut. I knew the film had done well, but I wasn't getting any offers. I can't sit idle at home because it makes me feel restless. However, I didn't let this negativity get the better of me. Thankfully, things are looking good at the moment with plenty of work. Right now, I'm as excited as a school kid about my debut in Bollywood. I had a similar feeling when I was awaiting the release of Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema Gaadha and now, I'm going through the same thing again.\" \nPublished Date: Mar 21, 2017 01:31 pm | Updated Date: Mar 21, 2017 01:31 pm Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T10:11:37.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
