The logo tells us that Samsung is dropping the “Edge” from its phone monikers this year, which fits in line with what we’ve heard about the Korean giant living on the edge with its new dual-display design and functionality and the below-expected sales of the flat-paneled Galaxy S7 . The moniker itself, containing the “+” symbol, has been used with the Galaxy S6 edge+ model announced on the same day in 2015 as the Galaxy Note 5. \nApart from its 6.2-inch screen differentiation from its smaller-screened sibling, the Galaxy S8+ is rumored to feature a higher storage configuration out of the box (128GB as opposed to 64GB of storage for the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8). Both handsets will feature the temporary Samsung-exclusive Snapdragon 835 , along with a front camera with autofocus, new AI Bixby based on S-Voice, an iris scanner, and perhaps include an S Pen accessory. This will mark the very first time that Samsung has utilized only dual-curved displays in its high-end Galaxy S series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:00:53.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
