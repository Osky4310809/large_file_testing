UG editor. Music lover. Constant searcher of something interesting and unique. Posted 7 hours ago 2 \n\nThy Art Is Murder have now officially confirmed the return of vocalist CJ McMahon to their lineup.In celebration of that, the band have released a video for their \"new\" song titled \"No Absolution.\" The track was originally written during the sessions for the band's \"Holy War\" album but only recently completed.CJ McMahon left the band back in December of 2015, but recently rejoined the band for some live shows - and now he's officially back.Guitarist Andy Marsh said of McMahon's return: \n\"A little over a year ago we were left in a pickle when CJ had finally reached his breaking point - the physical, emotional and mental stresses of touring, and the lifestyle had taken its toll on him. After the dust had settled we had time to speak amongst ourselves, and with him, and we were all able to get on the same page. \nHe was able to take time off from the road and work consistently, tick off some life goals like getting married, and enjoy the routine and familiarity of life at home with his friends and family. Conversely the rest of us kept going, touring relentlessly, playing bigger tours to more people than ever before, going to new countries for the very first time, and had a blast taking a few great vocalists and mates out for the ride with us while we weathered the storm and figured things out. Special thanks must go out to Monte Barnard, Nicholas Arthur, Lochlan Watt, and every other vocalist who took the time to apply in our discrete vocalist auditions. \nAfter a few months away from the chaotic life on the road CJ reached out to us and we started maintaining more regular communication. He mentioned how he had started cleaning up, was focused on working hard and saving for his wedding and enjoying time at home, but he also mentioned he missed the shows, the friends, and us - his band. \nAfter months of working things out, gaining his voice back, and mending wounded friendships, we are overwhelmed with excitement to announce that we have completed writing for a new record to be released later this year, featuring the one and only Christopher John McMahon. Welcome back CJ!\" \nAs McMahon put it about his return: \n\"I was a drug addict, I was a broke musician, and I had some fucking issues. I got married, I did some fucking soul searching, and now I'm back to take over the world with my fucking brothers.\" \nSpeaking of the below new song, Marsh shared: \n\"'No Absolution' is a rich tapestry, intertwined in faith, scripture and doctrine, and a story about the process that we have endured throughout the last year. We recorded this during the session for Holy War but quite simply ran out of time to finish writing lyrics and recording vocals for it in order to make the record. This song now stands alone, without a record or release - a gift from us to you, thank you for your continued support, we can't wait to show you what we're making for 2017.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T21:16:49.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
