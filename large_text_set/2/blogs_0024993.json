Leila De Lima, who surrendered to police over drug charges Friday morning, detained in the Philippine National Police headquarters in Quezon City. \nJudge Juanita Guerrero of Muntinlupa RTC Branch 204 ordered De Lima committed to the Custodial Service Unit at Camp Crame as requested by Senior Superintendent Belli Tamayo, regional chief of the police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group. \nThe Custodial Service Unit runs the custodial center where former Senators Jinggoy Estrada and Bong Revilla, who face plunder cases over their alleged involvement in the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, are being held. \nEven before De Lima was ordered arrested, PNP Director General Ronald Dela Rosa offered the use of the PNP Custodial Center if ordered by the court. \n\"For me, it's one of the most secure detention centers sa buong Pilipinas dahil nasa loob ng Camp Crame,\" he said in reports. \nDe Lima's Liberal Party colleagues at the Senate earlier said that they are worried for De Lima's safety in government custody.
