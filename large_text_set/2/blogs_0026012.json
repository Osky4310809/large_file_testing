I don’t usually go for all-inclusive package deals – or cruises, funnily enough – but since this experience I’ve been converted to both.\nI used to think being stuck on a ship for a week with the same people was my idea of hell, but it turns out it was just because those people kept trying to feed me bacon.\nAs soon as my fiancé Nolan and I arrived on board the ship, which was docked in Amsterdam, we headed straight for the bar, and I had my first White Russian since 2011.\nAnd, thanks to us having had a rather hellish flying experience and it being all inclusive and all, I followed it up with about five Bellinis.\nWe also took a minute to collapse in our cabin, which was massive and luxurious, with huge wall-sized windows.\nVegan White Russians on board (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) Then, finally, dinner.\nI knew there would be nice food on board the ship, but I had absolutely no idea how elaborate it would be.\nThey had amazing vegan versions of things I didn’t even know it was possible to make – not to mention the sheer quantity of it.\n9 reasons Chicago should be your next US holiday Every night for dinner there were five courses – starter, soup, intermezzo, main course, and dessert – with wine matched to the food.\nAnd we’re not talking ‘three asparagus tips with a balsamic vinegar drizzle’ type of main course (genuinely something that has been served to me as a vegan option in the past).\nWe’re talking hearty rucola dumplings in an onion sauce; spiced quinoa and lentil cakes in a tofu and vegetable broth; seitan stroganoff served with pappardelle.\nSeitan escalopes with celeriac mash (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) Quinoa and lentil cakes with spiced vegetable broth (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) For starters there were things like fried chickpea fritters, California sushi rolls, beetroot carpaccio with a ‘blue cheese’ mousse, vegetable tempura, as well as a salad alternative every evening.\nBut as a vegan, you also learn to appreciate the small stuff – which is why I squealed with joy when I saw there was vegan butter on the table for the bread.\nThe soup courses, which came soon after the starters, were hearty and delicious.\nBeetroot carpaccio as a starter (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) California rolls, served with a pipette of soy sauce (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) Parsnip soup (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) The desserts were incredible – fried cinnamon dumplings with vegan Chantilly cream, honeycomb fritters served with cream and shortbread biscuits, crepe suzette with even more Chantilly cream.\nThere was also the option of having vegan ice cream (not sorbet) each night, which was equally amazing – and always served with a very generous dollop of cream and a shortbread biscuit or wafer.\nAnd the service throughout the cruise was impeccable.\nCinnamon dumplings for dessert (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) The service was impeccable (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) It’s not just the dinner. You’re basically fed incredible food from the first moment you wake up.\nWhich leads us to breakfast. We really need to talk about this breakfast – a massive all-you-can-eat vegan breakfast buffet.\nThe hot food section included vegan sausages, hash browns, scrambled tofu, beans and vegetables.\nThen there were vegan croissants, pain au chocolats and muffins.\nMore: Travel What people eat on Shrove Tuesday around the world \n7 stunning cities you can fly to for less than £100 \n7 reasons why a trip to Buenos Aires is worth it for the food alone \n10 tasty reasons to get on a plane to St Lucia immediately \nAnd because the cruise company is German, they also had more continental offerings like rye bread, pates, vegan sliced ham and cheese.\nAnd naturally, there was green juice – it is a vegan cruise, after all.\nI ate all of this every single morning, like a bear preparing to hibernate.\nI ate all of this (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) And this (Picture: Ashitha Nagesh/Metro.co.uk) More: Travel Three Valleys ski break: 6 things you should do \nWhen is the Rio Carnival 2017?
