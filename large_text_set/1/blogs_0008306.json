King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 16 hours ago 13 Kirk Hammett was recently asked whether playing \" Enter Sandman \" so often gets boring after all these years. The guitarist told Eddie Trunk : \"From my point of view, from a guitar-playing point of view, Metallica songs are really fun to play. That fun factor is just there every time you play the song. \"But more importantly, what I like about playing that song - which never really gets tiring for me - is the effect it has on people when we play the first minute or so. People just transform, it's nuts! They get so excited, so happy, it's like a blast of energy and adrenaline.\" Kirk added: \"The other song that's very similar [in that aspect] is ' Nothing Else Matters ' - whenever we play it, the effect it has on people is amazing!\" Interestingly enough, neither \"Sandman\" nor \"Nothing Else Matters\" are not among Top 5 on the list of most performed Metallica songs ever. As you can see below, based on the band's official data , \"Sandman\" comes in at No. 6, while the ballad is at No. 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T10:02:00.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
