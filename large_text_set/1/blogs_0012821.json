The youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner-West crew made a major splash with the debut of her beauty line and lip kits, before launching her own line of merch and pop-up shops. One of fashion’s stealth style chameleons, Jenner has switched up her style from form-fitting dresses and long, tousled hair for a cooler, more laid-back aesthetic, and her latest look is a perfect example. \nSeen out and about in Los Angeles yesterday, Jenner seemed to be taking a leaf out of her big sister Kim’s playbook, with tailored track pants and an oversize bomber from Palace. Kardashian West has been pairing tracksuits from the forthcoming Adidas Calabasas collection with heels lately, but Jenner opted for more low-key footwear, offsetting her graphic trousers with equally graphic 350 V2 Boosts. Jenner has always been a dedicated sneakerhead, favoring trainers from Puma and her brother-in-law’s Yeezy line, so, in that sense, this was Kylie beating her own path.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:52:11.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
