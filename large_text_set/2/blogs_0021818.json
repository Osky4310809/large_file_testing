The network said that Colmes‚Äôs death came after a ‚Äúbrief illness,‚Äù and Fox gave tribute to his lifetime of accomplishments in a segment narrated by Colmes‚Äôs old conservative sparring partner, Sean Hannity . \nNews of Colmes‚Äôs passing immediately took off on Twitter, and there were expressions of sadness and loss from a wide variety of pundits and media figures: Oh, no! That's tragic. A really nice person who made a profound contribution to the national political dialogue. Condolences to his family. https://t.co/XwBhvmKQcY \n‚Äî Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) February 23, 2017 Sad to learn about @AlanColmes passing.
