According to E&E News reports , the conference was originally scheduled for February.\nThe conference had been in the works for months, and it was intended to bring experts and stakeholders together to discuss the latest evidence of and solutions to health risks posed by climate change. But according to E&E , the CDC suddenly canceled the summit shortly after Donald Trump’s election. The agency notified speakers and participants in a terse email. The agency gave no explanation. The email noted that the summit may be rescheduled for later in the year.\nFormer CDC officials and conference speakers were quick to draw political connections. They noted that President Trump has called climate change a “ hoax ” and has vowed to dismantle “harmful and unnecessary” climate change policies.\nThe former officials also pointed out that the CDC has a history of avoiding politicized issues, such as gun violence research and reproductive health.\nA formerly scheduled speaker for the conference, Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, told the Washington Post in an email that he feared the agency was self-censoring out of fear that the new Administration would cut their funding or retaliate. Maibach said the agency should instead hold firm on the side of established science and not create a precedent of bowing to political pressure.\nHe wrote:\nI don’t know why they canceled the meeting, but I do know the meeting was important and should have been held. Politics is politics, but protecting the health of our citizens is one of our government’s most important obligations to us... Climate change is bad for America, and bad for the world, in so many ways. One of these ways is that it is harming our health, already, and is likely to get much worse over the next few decades unless we take action. As the nation’s public health agency, we need CDC to be fully engaged in protecting our health from climate change.\nA more than 300-page government report from last year highlighted ways in which climate change poses a significant threat to the health of the American people. These include: boosting extreme weather events, such as heat waves, that could kill millions; increased spread of infectious disease by vectors, such as ticks and mosquitoes; degrading air quality; and adding stressors of our mental health and-well being.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:48:22.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
