Speaking about the track, Jay Kay said, “Cloud 9 is a song that’s written in the style that I hope people know us for and are familiar with. It’s a song that if anyone that has been jilted and yet found love somewhere else will no doubt relate to. Can’t wait for you to hear it – get in the car stick it on the radio and just drive.”\nAutomaton is due out on March 31. You can watch the video for the title track below.\n\nIn other music news, you can can listen to Kodak Black’s poignant new track, “My Time’, here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:11:25.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
