Honda Malaysia set to launch two more models this year – all-new CR-V VTEC Turbo and Jazz Hybrid? / 0 comments \nAt Honda Malaysia’s media night today, the company revealed that it will launch two more models this year, joining the BR-V and new City. Along with the announcement, the company also shared its powertrain direction for 2017 as well. \nBased on what we were shown, the VTEC Turbo engine as well as the Sport Hybrid Intelligent Dual Clutch Drive (i-DCD) system will feature in the two upcoming models. When asked which segments the new models will fit into, Akhbar Daniel, vice president of Honda Malaysia revealed that one will be a “utility” model while the other is a “fuel efficient” one. \nThe first will most likely be the fifth-generation CR-V , which now comes with the same 1.5 litre turbocharged mill as found in the current Civic. On the SUV, the mill churns out 190 hp and 243 Nm of torque, an increase of 20 hp and 23 Nm. \nRest assured that we will not be denied access to a turbocharged variant, although it remains to be seen if the 2.4 litre naturally-aspirated option will be included as well. \nMoving on, the mention of the i-DCD points towards the Jazz Hybrid that was on display during the preview of the BR-V in November last year. The model was hinted to arrive as a locally-assembled (CKD) model to take advantage of the government’s Energy Efficient Vehicle (EEV) incentives. \nThe Jazz Hybrid’s powertrain consists of a 110 PS/134 Nm 1.5 litre i-VTEC Atkinson-cycle engine to a 29.5 PS/160 Nm electric motor, a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and a lithium-ion battery. Unlike the previous model with the Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, the new one is capable of running on the electric motor alone if needed. \nCertainly looks to be an interesting 2017 then. Until we get an official launch date, are you excited for what could be the arrival of the next-gen CR-V and Jazz Hybrid? Let us know in the comments section below. \nGALLERY: Honda CR-V (US spec) 2017 Honda CR-V", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:59:44.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
