A message I alone was able to read in the fires of the universe,” faux Trump says. “And at midnight tonight, without my help and knowledge, every one of you will be dead.” \nSome may call this episode titled “The End of the World” the ultimate illustration of life imitating art, considering the episode aired May, 8, 1958. You have to admit, it is pretty amusing, especially when the TV character threatens, “Be careful, son. I can sue you.” \nSnopes found the YouTube clip and, for that, we tip our hat. \nCheck out the video above and be prepared to shake your head in disbelief. 14 People Donald Trump Has Called 'Overrated' on Twitter (Photos) \nAfter her Golden Globe acceptance speech, Meryl Streep was the latest person to be called \"overrated\" by President-elect Donald Trump.
