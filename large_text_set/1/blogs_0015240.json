Matt Matros The Owen + Alchemy space in Logan Square already has new tenants , as Limitless High Definition Coffee & Tea will open their first brick and mortar location on Thursday morning, less than a week after the juice bar closed. On Wednesday, workers were scampering around transforming the space. They had already removed O + A’s familiar verdant cross that’s been in their window since 2014. Limitless owner and Protein Bar founder Matt Matros sees the space as a place to train his employees as construction continues on his West Loop flagship . Limitless likes to market their drinks as having health benefits. The company believes the chili pepper in their Mayan latte will help speed up drinkers’ metabolisms, for example. Limitless, which debuted last year, has focused on the corporate sector but has designs on growing their business. Matros is friends with Owen + Alchemy owner Anne Owen. They’ve taken over the space as a favor, Matros said, so she’s not on the hook for the remainder of the lease. Matros said Owen—who said she will primarily focus on wholesale opportunities—will also work with the Limitless brand behind the scenes, using her knowledge as they develop different plant-based drinks, Matros said. Logan Square isn’t exactly a void for coffee shops with Gaslight Coffee, Cafe Mustache and others nearby. That’s why Matros sees the new location as a one-year pop-up. They’ll have an option to extend their lease after a year, but this is just mostly a training ground for staff. At the same time, Matros sees an opening thanks to the demise of Bow Truss Coffee Roasters . He’s already scheduled interviews with some of the coffee chain’s key staff for positions at Limitless. Limitless will first concentrate on the drinks, with beverages including a mushroom latte and a kava latte. Matros feels Logan Square residents will allow them to push boundaries of a normal coffee shop with more exotic offerings. They’ll eventually turn their attentions to food, teaming up with local bakeries. Owen + Alchemy’s kitchen will also allow culinary director Gina Calamia to continue menu development. She’s Roister’s former sous chef. Will Limitless make a mark in Logan Square? Find out on Thursday. The menu will change, but check out the opening offerings below. Limitless High Definition Coffee & Tea, 2355 N. Milwaukee Ave., open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays; 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T02:24:49.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
