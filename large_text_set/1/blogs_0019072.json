Europe sees UK set for 'hard' Brexit \nCommittee members will meet senior German MEP David McAllister, who is vice president of the European People's Party in the European Parliament, and Danuta Hubner, the chairman of the parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee. \nIn a speech last week, the prime minister said the UK \"cannot possibly\" remain within the European single market, as staying in it would mean \"not leaving the EU at all\". \nCommittee convener Joan McAlpine, an SNP MSP, said there was a \"great deal of concern in Scotland\" about what that would mean for people, organisations and sectors right across the country. 'Crucial phase' \nShe added: \"As Brexit gets closer - Article 50 is expected to be invoked in the next two months - it is vital that we explore all the ramifications of this as well as every possible avenue that helps Scotland retain as close a relationship with the EU and its single market as possible.\" \nDeputy convener and Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald added: \"We're moving into a crucial phase in the run up to Article 50 being triggered, and these meetings will help us understand the implications of Brexit for Scotland on major issues such as citizenship, the economy and trade.\" \nEU leaders have warned that the UK cannot access the single market, which allows the free movement of goods, services and workers between its members, while at the same time restricting the free movement of people - a key pledge of the prime minister. \nWhen she set out her key objectives for the Brexit negotiation process, Mrs May promised to push for the \"freest possible trade\" with European countries. \nShe also indicated the UK's relationship with the customs union - under which EU countries do not impose tariffs on each other's goods, while all imposing the same tariff on goods imported from outside the EU - would change. \nAnd she said she wanted the UK to be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries around the world as part of plans to create a \"truly global Britain\".
