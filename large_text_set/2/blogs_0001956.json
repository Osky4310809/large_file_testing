Vargas said the U.S. has a right to defend its borders, but “we have a right to ask harder questions of ourselves.” \n“Do you think I came to this country,” he asked, “so you can beat me up and call me illegal and criminal on national television?” \nAs they kept arguing, Carlson told him he’s throwing out “non-sequiters.” Vargas shout back, “You don’t actually operate in facts… I operate in facts, you’re a pundit.” \nCarlson asked him if he believes the U.S. has a right to tell people to leave. Vargas said the more important issue here is asking questions about why these people are in the U.S. in the first place and looking at the root causes of migration. \nCarlson was bewildered by his argument and again asked him if America has a right to control its borders. Vargas shot back, “You’re confused because you don’t deal with context.” \nWatch the whole segment above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:54:44.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
