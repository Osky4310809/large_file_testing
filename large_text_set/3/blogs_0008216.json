Peter Serafinowicz 's Big Blue Bug of Justice costume has been redesigned! \nLast summer when the first images were released of Serafinowicz in his Tick costume, which was designed by 4-time Oscar-winner Colleen Atwood, there weren't too many positive comments. Many had appreciated the open-faced costume with big, rounded muscles that Patrick Warburton donned in Fox's short-lived 2001 series. And even though everyone was told ahead of time that the Amazon reboot is “darker and more grounded,” people weren't expecting a costume with a tick-like texture, small eye circles, and thin antennas. Though to be fair, it is meant as a spoof on the highly-textured costumes that have become commonplace in modern superhero shows and movies. \nEven so, as you can see below, the revamped Tick costume now features larger eye holes and its sculpt resembles the cartoonish look of Warburton's but with angular designs for the faux muscles. \nAfter the pilot debuted on Amazon's Prime Video service in August 2016, The Tick live-action reboot was officially ordered to series a month later. For awhile, there was a dearth of news on the show's progress, but all that changed over the past several weeks. We've now seen behind-the-scenes photos of the cast participating in table reads for the first four episodes and, more importantly, filming officially commenced on the first episode just four days ago. \nA post shared by Peter Serafinowicz (@peterserafinowicz) on Mar 7, 2017 at 3:37pm PST \nDay 2 of #TheTick episode 1 shoot!
