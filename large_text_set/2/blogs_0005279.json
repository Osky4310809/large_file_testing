What happens next with the Brexit bill? | Jessica Elgot Read more \nIt will create a difficult decision for MPs such as Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, who has said he would find it hard to vote for the Brexit bill without amendments. There is also speculation about the way the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott , will vote, after she was absent from the first Commons vote with a migraine. \nHowever, one Labour shadow cabinet source said they did not believe Abbott in particular would end up walking away from Corbyn’s leadership team. \nAt the first vote last week, Corbyn suffered a rebellion of 47 MPs, or a fifth of the parliamentary party. Three shadow cabinet members, Dawn Butler, Rachael Maskell and Jo Stevens, resigned to vote against the legislation, while a dozen more junior frontbenchers chose to defy the whip. \nIt is understood that any disciplinary action against MPs who go against the whip will be decided only after Wednesday’s vote. \nOpposition parties have several key votes on Tuesday and Wednesday at which they will try to garner enough support to change Theresa May’s Brexit bill to secure a more meaningful vote at the end of two-year negotiations, impact assessments on the cost of leaving the EU and a guarantee for the rights of EU nationals. \nTwo Labour amendments attempting to get regular parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit and more say for the devolved administrations failed on Monday night, with government majorities of 49 and 57. Corbyn imposes three-line whip for Labour MPs to back article 50 bill at third reading - Politics live Read more \nOpposition MPs are more hopeful of gaining support from rebel Tories during the next two days on the issues of guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals in the UK or a more meaningful vote at the end of the two-year negotiations. \nSome Conservatives have indicated they could be willing to back amendment 110 tabled by Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, calling for “any new deal or treaty” with the EU to be put to a vote before both houses of parliament. This would give MPs the opportunity to reject any exit terms they felt unsatisfactory. \nThe government remains fairly confident of seeing off the rebels but may have to offer some further concessions to dampen down the revolt. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, May hinted that more detail could be given about the form of the vote after negotiations when David Davis, the Brexit secretary, addresses parliament on Tuesday, which may be enough to dissuade backbench Conservatives from rebelling. \nMay warned MPs not to obstruct the Brexit bill during its second phase of debate in the House of Commons, arguing that any move to slow down the passage of the bill was tantamount to obstructing the verdict of the June referendum. \n“Our European partners now want to get on with the negotiations, so do I, and so does this house, which last week voted by a majority of 384 in support of the government triggering article 50,” she said. \n“There are of course further stages for the bill in committee and in the Lords and it is right that this process should be completed properly. But the message is clear to all: this house has spoken and now is not the time to obstruct the democratically expressed wishes of the British people. \n“It is time to get on with leaving the European Union and building an independent, self-governing, global Britain.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T14:45:19.888+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
