Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAdoptive parents forced to send their children back into care have spoken of the emotional turmoil which led to their heartbreaking decisions. \nDespite thousands of youngsters successfully being taken in by families there are some who are sent back into care by parents who feel they can't cope. \nSocial services warned one father that the boy he was adopting could be difficult but he wasn't prepared for the violent outbreaks. \nRob, not his real name, said the boy aged four or five was \"violent towards my wife.\" \nHe added: \"She got kicked and thumped. There was quite a lot of emotional abuse to her as well. \n\"My wife now shows the sort of symptoms of someone who's suffered domestic abuse.\" Read More Some children are sent back if they don't settle in with families (Photo: Getty) \nThe couple had children of their own, but decided to adopt three more. \nHe told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that one of them had rejected their affections and attempts to love him. \nHe also said had the family been given more support, then the situation might have been different - but funding for specialist therapies has been cut. \nRob said he ended up with \"quite serious\" depression, and almost lost his job because he took a lot of time off work the BBC reported.

And how can you do that to your own son, whom you really love? It's heartbreaking.\" \nProf Selwyn said children who were older when they were placed with a new family were far more likely to suffer disruptions.

We are devastated.\" Read More Many adopted children are returned back into care (Photo: Getty Images) \nLiz, not her real name, adopted two sisters. The eldest was nine and never settled. \n\"The anger was off the scale really,\" Liz said. \n\"I lost my business because of the stress and in a way, you feel a sort of bitterness - not towards your daughter, but because of the system.\" \nLiz's elder daughter moved out when she was 16. \nNow 18 and a mother herself, she is still in touch with her adoptive parents, but said she had struggled to accept them. \n\"It was difficult, because it was a change, especially at nine years old,\" she said, \n\"It was strange, because you've got new parents. \n\"It was mainly difficult with my adoptive mum.
