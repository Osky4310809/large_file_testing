Emma Kemp AAP Share on Twitter \nFIFA has put its foot down on local governance reforms, forcing Football Federation Australia to confirm they will stand by the March deadline set for the changes. \nFFA chairman Steven Lowy and chief executive David Gallop made a dash to Zurich this week to personally ask FIFA president Gianni Infantino for permission to push back reforms to its contentious voting structure, with some frustrated A-League clubs concerned the pair may seek to scrap them altogether. \nTheir frustrations were heeded after the world governing body rejected the request during meetings on Wednesday with Infantino and other high-level FIFA officials. \nFFA all but confirmed as much on Friday by reaffirming its intention to meet with stakeholders, including A-League clubs, member federations and the players’ union, to agree on a new assembly by the end of March. \n“An EGM (extraordinary general meeting) will need to be held in order that the existing members can consider a special resolution to amend the Constitution of FFA based on the outcome of the stakeholders consultation process,” FFA said in a statement. FFA’s Steven Lowy and David Gallop travelled to meet FIFA’s president. Source: News Corp Australia \n“As part of this process FFA will continue its discussions with FIFA and AFC.” Lowy said he was confident the organisation could “move quickly to put in place some changes to our structure that will set the game up for further success in the years ahead”. \nShould they not be agreed and implemented by March 31, FFA will risk facing FIFA sanctions including, in the worst case, suspension. \nNews earlier this week of Gallop and Lowy’s trip to Europe drew a raging response from clubs, who accused FFA of breaking its promise and labelled as unacceptable any delay to “long-overdue reform”. \nHad that occurred the clubs, united in their desire for a bigger say, may have pushed harder for an A-League run independently of FFA. \nAs it stands, only 10 voters elect board members, the lowest electorate of any FIFA member nation. \nThe 10 A-League clubs have one vote, while A-League, W-League and Matildas players have no influence. \nFIFA is also alert to the way former chairman Frank Lowy was able to hand the reins of power to his son Steven unopposed in 2015. \nFFA said Infantino still intended to reschedule his postponed visit Australia sometime this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:14:55.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
