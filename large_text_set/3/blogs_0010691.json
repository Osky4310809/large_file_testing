Ackman, right, announced Monday that his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, had sold its stake — about 27 million shares — in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Credit Drew Angerer for The New York Times William A. Ackman is bailing out of one of his hedge fund’s worst investments by selling his fund’s shares in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International , a troubled drug maker.\nMr. Ackman’s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, said after the close of trading on Monday that it had sold some 27 million shares. For months last year, Mr. Ackman said that Valeant, once a favorite of many hedge funds, would turn things around . Shares of Valeant, which plunged from a high of $257 in the summer of 2015, closed at $12.11 on Monday.\nThe drug company has come under political attack for its pricing policy and has faced regulatory scrutiny over its accounting practices. In April, Mr. Ackman was called to testify at a Senate hearing, where he was questioned over his aggressive support of the company. As trouble mounted at Valeant, which was forced to change chief executives, Mr. Ackman became increasingly involved in trying to turn around the company’s fortunes.\nIn Monday’s announcement, Mr. Ackman said that he and Stephen Fraidin, a Pershing Square vice chairman, would remain on Valeant’s board until the company’s annual meeting but would not stand for re-election.\nPershing Square said in its statement that by selling now it would “realize a large tax loss, which will enable us to dedicate more time to our other portfolio companies and new investment opportunities.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The move by Mr. Ackman to part ways with Valeant has similarities with Pershing Square’s big investment in J. C. Penney, where he also had a board seat. Mr. Ackman made a huge bet on a turnaround strategy at J. C. Penney only to see it fail miserably, selling his stake in the company in 2013. But Valeant proved to be an even harsher bet for Mr. Ackman and Pershing Square; it was responsible for big losses incurred by the hedge fund the last two years.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy As of March 7, Pershing Square Holdings, a publicly traded portfolio that mirrors the main hedge fund, was down 1.5 percent for the year. Last year, the portfolio was down 13.5 percent, and in 2015, the portfolio was down 20.5 percent.\nMr. Ackman began buying into Valeant in 2015 and has said the average share price his firm paid was $190. As recently as the fall, he was defending the investment and the decision to gain two board seats.\n“I have an enormous stomach for volatility ,” he told an audience in November at the DealBook conference sponsored by The New York Times.\nIn Pershing Square’s statement, Mr. Ackman did not offer any reason for getting out of Valeant now or explain the decision to let his firm sell its shares. But the statement said, “We wish the company and its extremely hard-working, dedicated and loyal employees great success in the future.”\nContinue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
