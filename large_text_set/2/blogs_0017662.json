Recently, the optical division at FUJIFILM has been hard at work trying to develop a product for up-and-coming DPs and cinematographers. \nThe answer: the company's first ever native E-mount lenses, the Fujinon MK 18-55mm T2.9 and the Fujinon MK 50-135mm T2.9. \nClearly designed as workhorse lenses, the 18-135mm range covers most needs for professional work. \nPeep the first footage from Phillip Bloom with the 18-55mm (and his BTS video here ): \nClearly designed as workhorse lenses—lenses you won't often need to change or take off your camera—the 18-135mm range covers most needs for professional work. Though these lenses are unquestionably functional, their success will depend on how they stack up optically and subjectively. (Stay tuned; we'll have an in-depth review of these on No Film School later today.) \nThe MK 18-55mm T2.9 will be available in early March. The next lens in the series, the MK 50-135mm T2.9, will be available this summer. FujiFilm is also currently developing X-mount versions of these lenses.
