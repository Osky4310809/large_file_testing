A bridge to nowhere \nAt the time Trump's \"commitment\" to NATO was seen by Downing Street as one of the biggest achievements, not only of May's US trip but of her entire premiership. It was loudly boasted of by May and her ministers both in the House of Commons and around the world. When May travelled to the EU summit in Malta earlier this month she did so with the explicit intention of using this apparent commitment to leverage Britain's position in Brexit negotiations. \nPrior to her visit, one Downing Street source told journalists that \"the Prime Minister will brief EU leaders on her recent visit to the United States of America – where she secured a guarantee from President Trump that he was 100% supportive of NATO.\" \n\"She will say that this guarantee – and the recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defence — underlines the importance of strong cooperation on defence and security. \" \nDid the PM mislead the House? If the PM cannot tell a \"100% commitment\" from an \"ultimatum\", can we really rely on her to negotiate Brexit? pic.twitter.com/zgMKV98rZt — Theo Bertram (@theobertram) February 16, 2017 \nFor the UK government, Trump's \"guarantee\" on NATO underlined what they saw as Britain's biggest strength in Brexit negotiations — it's contribution to Europe's collective security and intelligence apparatus. \nMay hoped she could use this \"commitment\" to position herself as the transatlantic bridge between Trump and the EU. \nBut for European leaders who had already publicly identified Trump as one of the great threats facing the EU, there seemed little benefit in having a go-between with Trump. As the Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė told Sky News: \"I think there is no necessity of bridges.\" \n\"Today we are communicating with the United States mainly on Twitter.\" Diverging interests \nWith each passing week, the wisdom of May tying herself so closely to the Trump administration looks more and more questionable. Whether it be his policy on NATO, climate change, the Middle East peace process, or the future of the EU itself, Trump's international agenda is in almost all respects in direct opposition to long-standing British foreign policy. \nThe prime minister's gamble that a sympathetic approach to the new US administration would draw concessions was in some respects understandable. However, it relied on the assumption that Trump is a rational and consistent player on the world stage, whose commitments, which if not permanent, could at least be relied upon to last more than a few weeks. \nAfter Mattis' comments on NATO, that assumption now looks increasingly naive.
