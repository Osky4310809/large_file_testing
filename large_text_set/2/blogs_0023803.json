INQUIRER PHOTO / Joan Bondoc \nA Korean national allegedly asked for a total of P800,000 from the wife of slain South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo supposedly to be split between the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) Anti-Kidnapping Group and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). \nAKG Chief Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao disclosed this at the resumption of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs’ investigation on Thursday into Jee’s kidnap-slay in Angeles, Pampanga last October 18. \nDumlao said they invited for questioning a Korean national, Edward Yu-on, for his alleged role in the case. He described Yu-on as a “person of interest” in the kidnap-slay case.
