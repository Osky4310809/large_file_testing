I currently could not make that commitment. My thoughts and prayers are with those that carry such heavy burdens and responsibility for taking care of our country’s national security concerns. God bless this great country of ours,” Harward concluded. The retired vice admiral’s decision to decline the position is a disappointing development for the Trump administration. Shortly after Flynn’s resignation Monday evening, Harward’s name rose to the top of the list of potential candidates. Sources close to Harward said he turned down the job in part due to butting heads with the administration about his desire to bring on his own team. The president had reportedly told Flynn’s deputy, K.T. McFarland, that she could stay on after Flynn’s departure. \nA senior Republican official told CNN that “a question of clarity regarding the lines of authority” was a key factor in Harward’s decision. \n“I wouldn’t call it a disagreement as much as questions that could not be resolved to his comfort level,” the official added. \nThe president asked Flynn to resign after it became clear he had not been truthful with Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States.   \n“The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me,” Trump said. \nTrump named Ret. Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg as acting national security adviser shortly after Flynn’s resignation. Kellogg is one of the few potential candidates remaining for consideration for national security adviser, along with retired Army Gen. David Petraeus. \nA senior administration official said there are a few others aside from Kellogg and Petraeus who are in consideration for the role.
