The difference, however, was Terry’s goal for in a game that could have gone either way.\nTerry was the hero in the United States’ semifinal win over Russia.\nGoaltender Parsons saved 46 in the gold medal match, including all five in the shootout.\nCanada took the 1-0 lead four minutes into the game on a play off the rush. Thomas Chabot was left wide open by the United States’ defense and he was able to shoot in Matt Barzal’s pass through the slot past the blocker of goaltender Tyler Parsons. \nChabot goal, 1-0 Canada pic.twitter.com/3MJh8w1iKu \n— GIF Grand Maester (@myregularface) January 6, 2017 Jeremy Lauzon doubled Canada’s lead five minutes later after the United States turned the puck over in their own zone.

On a power play to open the third period, Nicolas Roy had the time and space to put a wrist shot from the left circle into the top corner of the net for the 3-2 lead.\nThree minutes later, a breakaway goal from Mathieu Joseph seemingly put the game out of reach for the United States 4-2. However, once again the Americans were able to stage a two-goal comeback thanks to a second goal from Bellows and Colin White’s first of the game that knotted the game at 4-4 and forced extra time. \nUSA ties the game again, goal from Colin White pic.twitter.com/BDB5kQjnDY \n— GIF Grand Maester (@myregularface) January 6, 2017 No score was had in the overtime period, and Terry was the only goalscorer in the shootout for either team while Parsons got the final save. \nTroy Terry scores in the 4th round (w/bench reaction) pic.twitter.com/kZxiYqEawh \n— GIF Grand Maester (@myregularface) January 6, 2017 Parsons save FTW pic.twitter.com/J67Ya2KIEE \n— GIF Grand Maester (@myregularface) January 6, 2017 The World Junior gold is the United States’ first since 2013.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T06:43:18.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
