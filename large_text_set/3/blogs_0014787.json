I think what’s great about that scene and what that scene propels for the rest of the movie is, ‘That’s OK.’ The movie is saying, ‘That’s OK,’ and all of the kids have to own who they are and find their tribe.” Why so serious? Power Rangers' first trailer ditches the kitsch Read more A gay superhero? Yes please! Just not Captain America Read more \nLGBT superheroes have been a mainstay in comic books in recent years, with Wonder Woman, Batwoman and Iceman each appearing as gay or bisexual at some point during their runs. But depictions of LGBT superheroes have been largely absent from film. Marvel’s antihero Deadpool, who identifies as pansexual, was one recent prominent big-screen exception – although he wasn’t shown having a non-heterosexual experience in the film . \nThe news about the Yellow Ranger comes shortly after Disney revealed that the character of LeFou in the live-action version of Beauty and the Beast is gay. The “exclusively gay moment” , as Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon described it, received much attention in the build-up to the film’s release. Russian cinemas handed it an adults-only rating , and censors in Malaysia requested the scene be cut. Disney has refused to remove the scene and postponed the film’s Malaysian release date. The controversy has done little harm to Beauty and the Beast’s standing at the box office, where it enjoyed a record-breaking weekend across the globe. \nPower Rangers will be released on 24 March.
