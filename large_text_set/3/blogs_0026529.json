I’m trying to open their eyes to what we believe is possible.” So said the manager on taking charge for the first time as the permanent incumbent and so he proceeded to oversee a bright and original-feeling England performance. This featured fluid movement, a high press when possible, and a defiance that even after Germany scored on 69 minutes allowed them to keep on playing in this fashion. Too much can be made of fresh dawns when it comes to Three Lions football, of course. But what Gareth Southgate has over his predecessor, Roy Hodgson, is a thinker’s approach and the courage to make brave choices. This suggests that should England fail (again) they will at least do it the right way. Lukas Podolski’s farewell stunner for Germany downs new-look England Read more 2 ) Three at the back looks a comfortable fit \nSouthgate’s stance that England need to be outward-looking and flexible was given a first test in his decision to field a trident of central defenders, Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling and Michael Keane. Of this, the manager said: “I want to learn something from the game, come away from the game having looked at something different. It is a good way to go in this game, having looked at Germany a lot, also think we need to be adaptable.” As the base of a 3-4-3 this is a rarely used system for England , so the way it helped allow the contest to be taken to Germany for large periods means it can be deemed a success. Southgate, then, should be given credit for a) trying it; and b) gaining the trust of his players as an innovator. 3 ) Vardy not Rashford the correct choice in the XI? \nThis seemed counterintuitive to Southgate’s wish to learn from the contest as the Leicester City striker is England-proven while the Manchester United teenager has had scant chance to show his worth at this level. Vardy wasted an early gilt-edged chance to repay Southgate when being fouled by Marc-André ter Stegen in the area but a swallow-like dive masked the goalkeeper’s contact and no penalty was awarded. If Vardy was chosen for his pace and razor-sharp finishing, England failed to utilise these qualities enough as his best other moment was an intelligent lay-off to Dele Ali near the break. What Rashford has over Vardy is more devilry yet, given this selection, it seems the latter will begin Sunday’s World Cup qualifier against Lithuania. 4 ) Livermore and Keane offer promise England’s Joe Hart and Michael Keane try to clear an aerial threat from Germany. Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters \nEngland’s two novices impressed enough to suggest they may have a future in the new regime. West Bromwich Albion’s Jake Livermore (in only his second appearance) was a mix of timely interceptions, smart passing and high energy as he contributed near the England and Germany goals. On his debut, Burnley’s Keane was posed few problems, especially during the first half, and came close to scoring an opener. The opportunity arrived on seven minutes but the former Manchester United defender blasted over from close range with a left-foot effort. Better was Keane’s sweetly flighted pass that curved in and around the outside of Germany’s defence into the run of Ali inside the area. As he and Livermore were not replaced at the interval each were given a fair go by their manager. 5 ) Wayne who? Germany 1-0   as it happened Read more \nIf it appeared a long way back for Wayne Rooney before the kick-off, post this promising England display an injury crisis really should be the record goalscorer’s only route to making appearance 120 for his country. Beforehand Ali declared his favoured position to be No10, where Rooney likes to operate, and at 20 years old has the talent and edge to be a fixture there for a decade, so why should Rooney ever be recalled? The Manchester United captain’s absence also removes the fixation on him being England’s saviour and the cult of star player over team ethic. Despite the defeat, Southgate emerges in profit and his dropping of the now surely erstwhile captain and how this moves England forward is a prime reason why.
