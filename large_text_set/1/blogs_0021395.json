REUTERS/Yves Herman 5442560 \nSeveral Greenpeace activists climbed a crane in Washington, D.C., to hang an anti-Donald Trump banner that says “RESIST.” \n“We can confirm that this is a Greenpeace action,” Cassady Craighill, a spokesperson for Greenpeace, told The Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday morning. \nAt least four protesters appear to be hanging from a construction crane in Northwest D.C. in protest of President Donald Trump entering the Oval Office. The incident took place on 15th St. between L and M Streets. Some of these streets were blocked. \nWATCH: \n“The sun has risen this morning on a new America, but it isn’t Donald Trump’s,” Pearl Robinson, one of the activists who unfurled the banner, told WUSA 9 . ”I fear not only the policies of the incoming administration, but also the people emboldened by this election to commit acts of violence and hate. Now is the time to resist.” \nWATCH: \n“A small group of protesters have engaged in dangerous behavior in downtown Washington, D.C,” D.C.’s Police said in a statement released on Twitter . “While we respect everyone’s right t[o] protest, today’s actions are extremely dangerous and unlawful. Multiple government resources are being tied up, and unfortunately streets are blocked while first responders try to safely address this matter.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T18:22:08.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
