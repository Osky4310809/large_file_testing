This is Maslenitsa. The fights are 100 percent staged. There were no harmful blows and there were no Ultras involved. We have been closely working with the fist fighting club for years.” \nResponding to warnings in the article that England fans could be killed if they come to the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Chernenko joked: “We have a trained bear, but it’s not trained to attack British fans.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T13:48:02.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
