These join the facelifted 911 Carrera and Turbo models that were revealed earlier. \nFor power, a 3.0 litre turbocharged flat-six engine churns out 450 PS and 550 Nm of torque, which is 30 PS more than the 911 Carrera S and 20 PS/110 Nm more than the previous GTS models that employed a 3.8 litre naturally-aspirated flat-six. The blown mill is mated to either a seven-speed manual transmission or optional Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK). \nPorsche’s Active Suspension Management (PASM) system comes as standard here, with the GTS Coupes benefiting from the PASM sports chassis as well, which lowers the ride height by 10 mm. Also standard is the Sport Chrono pack, which adds on dynamic engine mounts and a “Launch Control” function. \nAll GTS models (including the rear-wheel drive ones) also use the four-wheel drive 911 Carrera 4’s all-wheel drive chassis, giving them a common width of 1,852 mm and wider track measurements than standard 911 cars. \nIf you’re looking for the fastest sprinter of the bunch, the 911 Carrera 4 GTS Coupe is the one to have, which will complete the 0-100 km/h sprint in just 3.6 seconds. Porsche adds that all GTS models will have a top speed not exceeding 312 km/h, with the manual 911 Carrera GTS being the quickest among them. \nSetting the new 911 GTS models apart from the regular 911 models is a unique front bumper that appears to be inspired by the more powerful 911 GT3 , as well as a modified rear spoiler. These are part of the Sport Design exterior package, that also include new mirrors, 20-inch central-locking wheels and GTS logos. 911 Carrera 4 GTS \nIn other areas, there are smoked taillights, gloss black air intake grille and central black twin tailpipes of the sports exhaust system. On rear-wheel drive models (those without the ‘4’ in its name), there is a black trim strip between the taillights, while all-paw GTS cars get a characteristic light strip trim in said area. The Targa bar is finished in black on GTS models as well to create a distinctive look. \nInside, you’ll find GTS logos on the headrests, while the steering wheel rim, armrests and centre console are all trimmed in Alcantara. Finishing touches can be found on the instrument cluster, where there are now brushed black aluminium trim strips. 911 Carrera GTS 911 Carrera 4 GTS Cabriolet 911 Carrera 4 GTS Cabriolet Interieur 911 Carrera 4 GTS Cabriolet 911 Carrera 4 GTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T07:07:00.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
