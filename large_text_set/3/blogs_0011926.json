Leroy Sane extended the advantage ahead of the second leg with a goal in 82 minutes. \nGuardiola spoke to the press ahead of Wednesday's return fixture, discussing team news, his aspirations in the competition and his own future. Here are five things we learned. There will be no Barcelona return for Pep \nThe Man City boss had been tipped as one of the potential successors to Luis Enrique at the end of the season. \nGuardiola managed the Catalan giants between 2008 and 2012 - one of the most successful periods in the club's history.

Man City are desperate to make Champions League success a reality (Photo: Getty) \n\"I know how complicated the competition is in terms of set pieces and losing concentration. I think honestly I am not able to talk about if we are able to win the Champions League. \n\"But be sure, we are going to try, be sure of that.\" Man City are NOT overawed by the Champions League \nGuardiola acknowledged that his side have little history in the Champions League, but refused to suggest that this would hold them back in anyway. \nSpeaking to the press, the Spaniard pointed out that his side deserve to be in the competition, and his players are professionals. \n\"We don't have the long history of the other clubs, so if we go through to the quarter-finals it will be the second time in the club's whole history,\" said Guaridola.

Talking about a complex, all the players are so professional, they show it against big teams. \n\"We are here because we deserve to be.\" Guardiola has no new injury concerns \nAside from Gabriel Jesus and Ilkay Gundogan, the Spaniard has a fresh bill of health in which to select his first XI from. \nMonaco on the other hand are without some key players, which could make all the difference as they look to turn this tie around.
