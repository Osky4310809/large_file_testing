With Michael Mayer directing, known for his Broadway work on Spring Awakening , for which he won a Tony Award — Toy Story 4 writer Martin Hynes will also write Atlantis , while Williams and Mimi Valdes will produce the project via their I Am Other endeavor. Gil Netter of Life of Pi will also serve as a co-producer.\nInterestingly, Williams’ endeavor on film continues to rise, as he was a producer on FOX ‘s acclaimed hit Hidden Figures , which was nominated for three Oscars.\nIn addition, he wrote songs for the film that starred Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monae — and most notably, the hit “Happy” from Despicable Me 2 for which he received an Oscar nomination.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:44:13.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
