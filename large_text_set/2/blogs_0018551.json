I'm so there. I'm very excited to start my life on one of the TRAPPIST-1 planets and never pay my student loans again, but I do have some pressing questions. May I speak to the Captain Von Trapper, please? First of all, which planet has the best Beyoncé? There are seven planets so that's, like, seven Beyoncés which makes that solar system already better than ours. Are these planets like alternate timelines or is this Beyoncé an alien Beyoncé? Either one is fine. GIF Next question! I looked on Zillow and I couldn't find any prices for houses on the new planets. Is property just free or what? And what currency do you use? Is it all Harriet Tubman 20s? Because that's all I'm bringing. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Speaking of everything being free: is there a TRAPPIST-1 planet where Bernie won? What's Susan Sarandon doing on that planet? Is she still doing Feud ? I'm really excited about Feud but I'm also really interested in universal healthcare, so I'm torn. What do you do for fun? Do you have Disney World? Is your Disney World called the Trappiest Place on Earth? If not, why not? Do you do word play? Or are you all those squid aliens from Arrival ? Am I going to have to use a whiteboard to teach you how to speak? Can we not? I'm exhausted. Let's just sit quietly forever. Speaking of Arrival, on which of your planets does Amy Adams have the most Oscars? On which planet did Glenn Close get an Oscar for playing Cruella de Vil? On which planet does Constance Wu win an Emmy every year? Please get back to me in writing. GIF Next question! According to the very informative tweet I read, scientists are still searching for signs of water on the planets. Will you let me know when you figure that out because I am very thirsty. @JOEREID Speaking of thirst, what is your Idris Elba situation? Is he Bond on your planets? Is he everything on your planets? What is your Justin Trudeau situation? Justin Trapdeau? Justin Trapdoor? Can you send photographic evidence please? Immediately? Do you have a Canada on one of your planets? Is everything Canada on your planets? Will I have to learn squid French? Can we not? I'm exhausted. What is the Electoral College situation on your planets? Just out of curiosity? Does it, like, work? I'm not saying I'm coming to your planets with a bunch of baggage, I'm just saying that like a grilled cheese sandwich you make at 3 a.m. to satisfy drunk munchies, I've been burned before. Let's see, what else? How many Real Housewives spinoffs do you have going on? Because I am swamped. What's your television recapper situation? Cuz I guess I need a job. Do you call them retrappers? GIF Scientists say that the planets are 39 light years away but I'm not dieting right now so how many whole fat years is that? Do I need to go into cryogenic sleep to get there? Because that turned out terribly for Sigourney Weaver in Alien and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers so I think I'll just binge This Is Us the whole time and stay completely awake. Because aliens. And Chris Pratt. Anyway, Trapptain Picard, please respond as soon as possible. My Lyft is outside so I'll see you soon! GIF Follow R. Eric Thomas on Twitter .
