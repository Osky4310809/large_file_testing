He added that the group is targeting to export about 400,000 tons to the U.S. soon. \nDangote said the country would be self-sufficient in the production of a lot of items in the nearest future. He said the group is building a refinery with a capacity of 650 million barrels per day, which will satisfy the demand of the entire Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). \nHe thanked Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for facilitating the siting of his petro-chemical plant within the Lekki corridor, saying that were it not for the former Lagos State governor who assisted in providing about 2,008 hectares of land for the project, it would have been taken elsewhere. \nThe Dangote Group President said the petro-chemical plant is 10 times the size of the one in Eleme, Rivers State and that the plant employs about 18,000 workers. He said by next year, the staff strength would increase to 60,000. He gave 2019 as the project’s completion. \nDangote said the group has a plan to expand its sugar production, by setting up plants in Nasarawa and Taraba states. He said by the time the two plants come on stream, the country would be producing 2.5 million tons of sugar, almost twice the commodity’s local consumption of 1.7 million tons. \nHe said his group has initiated move to set up a rice processing mill, with a capacity of producing 1.6 million metric tons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T05:23:58.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
