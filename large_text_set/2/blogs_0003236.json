reunited with her sister Salma (R) at San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco REUTERS \nTravellers from seven predominantly Muslim nations listed in President Donald Trump ’s blocked travel ban are in a race against time to return to the United States amid fears the executive order could be reinstated. \nFamilies were reunited in emotional scenes around the country on Sunday night as the White House prepared for a court showdown over the ban. \nMany had been stranded in legal limbo before a judge ordered a temporary halt to the ban, a decision backed yesterday by the US Court of Appeals. \nThe immigration order will remain suspended at least until later on Monday when the Trump administration will argue that it should be reinforced. \nAmong those able to beat the clock were 12-year-old Eman Ali and her father, Ahmed, who arrived together on Sunday at San Francisco International Airport, where they were greeted by her older sister and other relatives. She ran to embrace her sister, and the two hugged and cried. 12-year old Eman Ali of Yemen, centre-left, and her father Ahmed Ali (R) arrive at San Francisco International Airport (REUTERS) \nEman and her father had been stuck in the east African nation of Dijbouti since Monday, when authorities refused to let her board a plane with him to the US as she is from Yemen, one of the seven nations - along with Iran, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Iran and Sudan - listed in Mr Trump's order. \n“It's not fair. I mean some people they are bad, but that doesn't make everybody bad,” Mr Ali said of the president’s ban. \nIranian graduate student Sara Yarjani, who was initially denied entry into the US under the travel ban, has also returned to America. \nShe was sent back to Vienna, where she had been visiting relatives, last week, but was allowed back into Los Angeles airport on Sunday. \nShe has a valid two-year student visa, and thanked Americans for their support. \nAmmar Aqel Mohammed Aziz and Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz, both from Yemen, are Green Card holders who were travelling through Washington Dulles on their way to Flint, Michigan, when the ban took effect and they were sent to Ethiopia. \nLawyer Paul Hughes said an agreement was reached with the government to allow their re-entry, and they are expected to arrive back in the US on Monday.

They had not previously tried to travel to the US and been turned back, but rather they are migrants who are rushing to take advantage of the window offered by the court ruling. \nOn Sunday, a judge in San Francisco rejected the government's request for an immediate reinstatement. Formal arguments in the case begin on Monday. \nMr Trump responded to the freezing of his order by tweeting that he had “instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY.” \n“Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” Mr Trump wrote earlier. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” \nVice President Mike Pence called the court order declining to reinstate the ban “frustrating” and described it as inconsistent and unconstitutional. \n“It's quite clear the president has the ability to decide who has access to this country,” he added.
