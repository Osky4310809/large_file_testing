Asked whether the president was the target of a counterintelligence inquiry, he replied: “I think that’s what we need to find out. There’s obviously a lot of concern.”\nBut after an aide slipped Spicer a note, he circled back to clarify that “there is no reason to believe there is any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice.” The press secretary insisted he was not disavowing the president, who posted his tweets early on Saturday morning from Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n“The tweet dealt with wiretaps,” Spicer said. “The other is an investigation. They are two separate issues.”\nRob Carr / Getty Images President Donald Trump and former president Barack Obama exchange words at the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC While the FBI is conducting a wide-ranging counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, there is no public evidence that Trump is a target. The Justice Department defines “target” as someone whom investigators have substantial evidence against and who is likely to be indicted.\nCurrent and former officials have said repeatedly that although they were concerned about intelligence suggesting meetings between associates of Trump and Russian officials, they have developed no evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia’s hacking efforts. Spicer cited the former director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., who last Sunday made that point on the NBC program “Meet the Press.”\nBut Clapper also said he had no knowledge the government had sought a warrant from a foreign intelligence court to install a wiretap in Trump Tower. On Saturday, the director of the FBI, James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Trump’s claim that his agency had wiretapped his phones. The department has refused to do so.\nSpicer complained bitterly about news media coverage of ties between Trump and Russia, saying it was fueled by leaks from anonymous sources, none of which had been substantiated.\nAndrew Harnik / Associated Press President Donald Trump arrives in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, March 7, 2017 “It’s interesting how many times this fake narrative gets repeated over and over and over again,” he said. “And yet no evidence has ever been suggested that shows the president has anything to do with any of the things that are being said. It’s a recycled story, over and over and over again.”\nThe problem for the White House is that Trump fueled this week’s cycle of stories himself. On Wednesday, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate’s Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism asked the FBI and the Justice Department for evidence that the government had sought legal permission to tap Trump’s phones.\nThe request came in a letter from Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., to Comey and the acting deputy attorney general, Dana Boente. Boente is overseeing the Russia inquiry because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any cases involving the Trump campaign and Russia, after acknowledging he met with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak.\nRelated Top judiciary panel senators ask DOJ, FBI for Trump wiretapping warrant applications ‘I haven’t seen him this angry’: Donald Trump rages at leaks, setbacks and accusations Trump accusation of a wiretap echoes a 1991 conspiracy theory that Nixon was victim of a ‘silent coup’ FBI Director asked Justice officials to refute Trump’s unproven claim that Obama ordered wiretap of his phones “We request that the Department of Justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders — redacted as necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods that may be compromised by disclosure, and to protect any ongoing investigations — related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump campaign or Trump Tower,” the senators wrote.\nWith no evidence of wiretaps emerging, the White House has been forced into a defensive communications strategy. It has curtailed Trump’s appearances before cameras, where reporters could ask him about his claims. Spicer held his briefing on Monday without TV cameras, though on Tuesday and Wednesday, he answered questions at length and before the cameras.\nOn Tuesday, the administration sent the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, on CNN, where he, too, provided no evidence of any wiretapping. However, Kelly said, “if the president of the United States said that, he’s got his reasons to say it.”\n\nWith files from Matt Apuzzo \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T15:27:52.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
