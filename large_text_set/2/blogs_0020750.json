Bridgeport Police Department \nIt’s believed the teen fabricated the story about the alleged sexual assault so she would “get sympathy” from a prospective boyfriend. \nAs a result of her false accusations, Yovino was arrested and now faces charges of falsely reporting an incident as well as tampering with or fabricating physical evidence. \nBack in October, the student accused two Sacred Heart football players of attacking her and raping her in a bathroom at an off-campus party. \nWhile both of the football players admitted to having sex with Yovino, the men insisted the sexual acts performed with Yovino were consensual.

My friends are waiting for me outside, let me go outside.’ \nThe teen was caught lying about the rape to get sympathy from her prospective boyfriend after sexts were found on her cell phone. \nAccording to reports from WABC-TV, Captain Brian Fitzgerald claims another student told police Yovino had sent explicit text messages to the two football players prior to the alleged incident. \nOther students at the off-campus party also reported Yovino had gone into the bathroom with the two men willingly and one man even recorded a short clip of the alleged “sexual assault” on a cell phone. Facebook \nLegal documents reveal, \nShe admitted that she made up the allegation of sexual assault against (the football players) because it was the first thing that came to mind and she didn’t want to lose (another male student) as a friend and potential boyfriend. She stated that she believed when (the other male student) heard the allegation it would make him angry and sympathetic to her. \nDespite the incriminating evidence in the text messages, Mark Sherman, Yovino’s lawyer, told The Connecticut Post his client maintains her innocence and is sticking by her original story of the incident. \nYovino has since been released from police custody on bail. \nHowever, Yovino could face up to five years in jail if she is found guilty of the false rape allegations. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
