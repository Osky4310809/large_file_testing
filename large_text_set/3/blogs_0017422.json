To watch the debate live in English on FRANCE 24 at 9pm Paris time, click on the player below. \nThe candidates will all be asked to present their visions for France’s society, economy and place in the world. The battle is expected to last at least two-and-a-half hours. \nMacron and Le Pen, the frontrunners according to the opinion polls, and Fillon, the embattled conservative candidate under formal investigation for allegedly embezzling state funds, are poised to be the evening’s prime targets. \nTonight’s debate, which marks this election’s first direct public interaction between any of its candidates, is also being broadcast on French channels TF1 and LCI. \nThe election’s six other contenders, condemned to sit out this clash, will have a chance to join the fray on TV at a later stage in the campaign. Two more debates are scheduled, on April 4 and 20. The presidential finalists will then square off in the traditional televised duel before the deciding vote is held on May 7.
