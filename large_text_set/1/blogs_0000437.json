Last Updated: 02/01/17 12:22am Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness debate who scored the better scorpion kick, Olivier Giroud or Henrikh Mkhitaryan In the last week, the Premier League has witnessed two of the best goals in the competition's history. \nHenrikh Mkhitaryan's sensational scorpion kick against Sunderland on Boxing Day was followed by a similar effort by Arsenal's Olivier Giroud on New Year's Day, which you can watch in the above video. \nBut which was better? \nCast your vote here and then see what the Sky Sports experts said on Sundayâ€¦ \nGARY NEVILLE \n\"I never thought I'd see something like this again. Giroud's is higher and more difficult, probably, than Mkhitaryan's. That one was incredible, but this is frightening. \n\"It's instinctive and you have to say it's brilliant. He doesn't normally finish them like that and it's absolutely incredible. \n\"I have to say it's one of the best goals I've ever seen. You see sometimes goal that you've seen before of a certain type, but when you see two like that in the matter of a week or so it's incredible.\" \nJAMIE CARRAGHER \n\"It's amazing. Watching it, I was in disbelief. Has he really just done that? I am a fan of Giroud, who gets a lot of criticism at times, but I think he's a good striker. Is it one of the best goals Arsenal have scored in the Premier League? I think of Dennis Bergkamp at Newcastle and Bergkamp at Leicester. It's certainly right up there with some of the goals Thierry Henry has scored. \n\"Before you get to the individuals, I think the Arsenal build-up makes it. Whenever I see a goal go in off the bar it always looks better and I think Giroud's goal is better. Mkhitaryan's was slightly offside, but it counted on the day and you thought when that went in it would be goal of the season. Then a week later Giroud goes and does this...\" \nGRAEME SOUNESS \n\"Giroud's is a fantastic goal and a great bit of football. You have to say Alexis Sanchez's cross is not a great cross, it's behind Giroud, but like Mkhitaryan he improvises and it's absolutely spectacular. \n\"When you get the benefit of the replay there's no-one else up there with him and he's trying to get it goal-bound. He's improvised and he's meant it and it's a spectacular goal.\" B'mouth vs Arsenal", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T09:40:03.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
