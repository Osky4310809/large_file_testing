Photo: Bunmi Azeez \nAmbode, who spoke when he received Fashola and some top officials of the Ministry on a courtesy visit to the Lagos House, Ikeja, described the occasion as historic, adding that it was gratifying to receive the Minister for the first time since he left office on May 29, 2015. \nHe said: “On behalf of the people of Lagos State, I would like to wholeheartedly welcome Mr. Babatunde Fashola, my predecessor and now Minister for Works, Power and Housing and especially back to the Alausa office where he actually left about 22 months ago. The governor lauded Fashola for serving Lagos meritoriously, saying his administration improved on the template already laid down during the previous administration. \n“We want to say that whatever it is that we have done in the last 22 months is just more or less a fall out of the great achievements the former governor had already put in place”, he stated. \nMeanwhile, Fashola has commended Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, for contributing to national development, noting that the Federal Government was committed to refunding the money his government had spent on the repair of federal roads in the state. \nThe minister spoke while being hosted by Amosun to a banquet in Government House, Isale Igbein, Abeokuta. \nResponding, Amosun said the state government had spent N223bn on federal government roads in the state. \nHe drew attention of Fashola to roads belonging to the federal government which needed urgent attention to include Papalanto- Interchange -Sagamu Road, Papalanto -Ilaro Road, Lafenwa -Imeko Afon Road, and old Lagos -Abeokuta Road. \nAmosun said these roads should be fixed urgently, given the amount of economic activities being affected due to their deplorable conditions.
