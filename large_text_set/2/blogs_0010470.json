Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLiverpool skipper Jordan Henderson has admitted the Reds are in danger of letting their fine start to the season go to waste. \nJurgen Klopp's men are on a run of just one win from 10 matches since the turn of the year and that came in the FA Cup replay against Plymouth. \nLiverpool went into 2017 in second in the Premier League but are now fifth, 13 points adrift of Chelsea, and have been dumped out of both cups. \nSaturday's visit of Tottenham is now a huge game for the Reds and Henderson accepts they must arrest the slide immediately. \n\"January wasn’t what any of us had hoped for and it certainly wasn’t what any of us expected, from ourselves as individuals or the team,\" he writes in the matchday programme.
