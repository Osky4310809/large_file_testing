The structure should be demolished,\" he added. \nHe also remarked that PWD is spending millions of rupees for the upkeep of Jinnah’s residents. The Enemy Property Act took the right away from Jinnah’s family to claim the house. \nEarlier this month, the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Bill, 2016, was passed in Lok Sabha giving government the power to seize the properties of the people who migrated to Pakistan or China. \nMoreover, Lodha also demanded that a cultural centre be built in the place of the house. \"The structure should be demolished and a cultural centre highlighting Maharashtra's culture and pride should be built. The cultural centre should also exhibit the glorious history of India,\" Lodha demanded. 0 0 BJP leader demands demolition of Jinnah House in Mumbai was posted in world   Cultural Centre, Geo News, Geo News Latest, India.
