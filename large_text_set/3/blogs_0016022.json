I am sitting in the back of a New York taxi hurtling forward on the FDR Drive. I’ve just landed after a bumpy shuttle flight down from Boston, and as I look down to check my phone it hits me: a wave of nausea, a punishing tightness, and a sense that I am seeing strange colors. Reflexively, I go to massage my neck and shoulders, only to be hit with a strike of pain and even stronger nausea when I do. I know this isn’t just a headache, at least not anything I’ve ever called a headache. It is a migraine.\nHow am I going to get through my workday?\nAlmost 5 million people in the U.S. experience at least one migraine attack per month, while more than 11 million people blame migraines for causing moderate to severe disability. The World Health Organization estimates that migraines effect about 30% of the global population, while 1.7–4% experience headaches more than half the time. Headache disorders, according to the WHO study, were the third-highest cause of disability. Migraines occur more often in women (18% of women compared to 6% of men), and are most common in people between the ages of 35 and 55 – prime working years. Ninety-one percent of people who have suffered from a migraine said they had to miss work or otherwise couldn’t function properly. Employers lose billions of dollars each year from lost productivity or employees taking sick days\nBecause I know I’m not alone in suffering from migraines that can interfere with my work, I asked Dr. Donavon Khosrow Aroni, a craniofacial (sometimes called orofacial) pain specialist at Tufts Dental School for some background information. Dr. Aroni is the doctor who finally “got it” for me and I’m really grateful to him.\nAroni emphasizes that all headaches have different causes and it’s important to source what specifically is causing yours. In the case of my New York migraine, the pain could have been triggered by any number of things: exhaust from a truck, eye strain from staring at my iPhone too long, fluorescent lights, scrolling a lot on my laptop, or even flying.\nStress can also play a major role. It used to be that every work day, at around 3:00 pm, I’d feel the headache begin to build. By 4:00 pm, I’d be useless.\nThe diversity of these triggers (from iPhones to car exhaust) and their unavoidability (given that I run a business and have three small children, it is unlikely that I can avoid stress, and I am quite an anxious person) make it hard for migraine sufferers to get relief. I tried weekly clinical massages, exercise, Botox. I saw a neurologist. I had my hormone levels tested. I saw an ENT specialist to check my sinuses and an orthodontist who treated me for grinding my teeth in my sleep. When that didn’t work I tried Chinese herbalists, acupuncture, energy healers, chiropractors, you name it.\nAfter almost five years of seeking a solution, it took a skilled dentist and a complicated piece of plastic to manage my migraines, which it turns out are mostly caused by horrendous clenching of the jaw. Years and years of somatizing my stress into TMD (temporomandibular joint disorder, often just called TMJ by most people) caused a major problem and permanent trauma to my jaw joints.\nWhile my case is more extreme than most, lots of information economy workers and smartphone addicts like me are causing ourselves pain without even knowing it. Dr. Aroni explains that because of the way many of us use our devices all day, hunch over laptops and screens, our posture is completely thrown off. Our shoulders, neck, head and jaw muscles (which are all interconnected) are under tremendous strain, and mostly, it doesn’t get released. Strain that never gets released causes muscles that lack blood flow, muscles that are constantly working, and now are hypertonic muscles. Those tight and painful hypertonic muscles can create different types of headaches, with different symptoms.\nMuch of this stems from a simple but harmful postural adjustment all that “device hunching” causes us: we now hold our necks slightly forward, and we look down. For every single inch forward or down we hold our head and neck, the muscles of the neck gain up to about 10 pounds in weight.\nThis posture and tightness affects all the neighboring anatomical structures in the face. If muscles are constantly strained without giving them a break to relax and get back into natural resting position, those tight hypertonic muscles through the jaw, neck and upper shoulder can drive up the frequency and intensify severe headaches and turn into a migraine or even a milder form of headache or face pain known as tension headache. And then it can become a vicious cycle, because pain causes us to clench muscles even more.\nThis can impact our daily performance, quality of life, and also affect the quality of our sleep. Dr. Aroni explains that “if we don’t get a good quality of sleep, these muscles never get a chance to relax.” The muscles stay tight and painful.\nThat’s why craniofacial pain specialists use a multidisciplinary approach — embracing everything from biofeedback relaxation, physical therapy, different prescriptions including muscle relaxants, sleep evaluation, and the retainer-like devices I now wear almost 24 hours a day to keep my jaw stabilized and allow the muscles in my whole head and neck to unclench and relax. “These oral orthotic devices are mostly mistaken with ordinary nightguard or mouth pieces. These are custom-fabricated devices and are mainly designed to address various musculature problems accordingly” notes Dr. Aroni.\nIf you suffer from migraines and seeing a craniofacial pain specialist isn’t a viable option for you, a simple technique Dr. Aroni recommends is to work on your posture. Become aware of the triggers that cause you to clench, hunch, or lean forward. Simple mindfulness techniques can help you become more aware of your body. For example: Do certain stressful moments make you clench your jaw? (For me, a major tell was how I feel when flying. My whole upper body locks up.) Stand up: Is your head tilting forward ever so slightly? Are you constantly looking down at your smartphone? The next time you’re working on your laptop or desktop, notice your neck and head posture. Are you hunched over, or are you upright?\nUnclenching takes time, and there’s no miracle cure. But for the good of your professional self as well as your health and happiness, start now.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T14:28:06.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
