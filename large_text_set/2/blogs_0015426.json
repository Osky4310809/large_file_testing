That event has more than 800,000 Facebook group members at present and, if such momentum continues, could lead to an unprecedented demonstration by scientists against the new administration. QUOTATION OF THE DAY \n“The anti-suffragists can gather more statistics than any other person I ever saw, and there is nothing so sweet and calm as when they say, \"You cannot deny this, because here are the figures, and figures never lie.\" Well they don't but some liars figure. When they start out they always begin the same. She started by proving that it was no use to give the women the ballot because if they did have it they would not use it, and she had statistics to prove it. If we would not use it then I really cannot see the harm of giving it to us, we would not hurt anybody with it and what an easy way for you men to get rid of us. No more suffrage meetings, never any nagging you again, no one could blame you for anything that went wrong with the town, if it did not run right, all you would have to say is, you have the power, why don't you go ahead and clean up.” —Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, “The Fundamental Principle of a Republic,” June 21, 1915", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:04:14.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
