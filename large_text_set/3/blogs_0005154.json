All you have to do to enable it is authorize the add-on with access to your blog by signing up to your WordPress account. \nThe integration also comes with a convenient sidebar where you can keep of all authorized sites and collaborators working on your pieces. Once you save a draft, the add-on will generate a preview link where you can check out how your work will appear when published. \nWordPress-parent company Automattic has open-sourced the plugin on GitHub where you can browse the code by heading to this repository here . \nCheck out the official announcement here for more details on how to download and implement the add-on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:06:36.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
