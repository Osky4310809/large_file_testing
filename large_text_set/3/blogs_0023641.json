There’s nothing quite like pilfering a recipe – especially when you shamelessly pilfer one of your own recipes. At least I’m giving myself credit – it’s just blogging etiquette. These pancakes were inspired by my very own Virtual Vegan Potluck contribution for Mocha Spice Cake. Even as I stirred the batter for that cake, I was dreaming of these pancakes. But don’t limit yourself – this batter would make awesome waffles as well. Mocha Spice Pancakes With Simple Syrup [Vegan] This Recipe is : For the Mocha Spice Pancakes: 1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour 1/2 cup almond meal 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 tablespoon herbal coffee 1 large very ripe banana, mashed 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal, plus 6 tablespoons water (whisk together and then let sit for a few minutes) 2 cups almond milk 1 tablespoon crystallized ginger, chopped Toasted pecans (optional) 1/4 cup pure maple syrup 1/2 teaspoon instant espresso Preparation To Make the Pancakes: In a large bowl whisk together the flour, almond meal, cocoa, herbal coffee, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt. In a smaller bowl, combine the banana, vanilla extract, nut milk, maple sugar and flaxseed meal. Stir in the cacao nibs and the crystallized ginger. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until just combined. Let the batter sit for about 15 minutes. Ladle big spoonfuls of the batter onto a hot griddle that has been lightly spritzed with cooking oil. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface of the cake, carefully flip, and cook for a few minutes. Keep cooked pancakes in a warm oven (along with your plates) while you cook the remaining batter. To Make the Syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the maple syrup, instant espresso, and cinnamon and heat until toasty hot. Serve pancakes with chopped pecans and the syrup.
