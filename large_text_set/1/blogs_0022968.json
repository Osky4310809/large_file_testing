I have loved the subject of this week’s Crush column since I was four years old, when his jeans and fringed leather made me understand that style is something for everyone – you only need the panache to carry it off. George Michael, gone far too soon at the age of 53 , had panache in spades. \nI remember that Faith was the first time I really saw him, and it was enough to fall in love: the designer stubble, the stonewash jeans (that I begged my mother to buy me when we were next at M&S), that thick wavy hair, the easy smile.
