That’s why, since 2015, we here at KQED Arts have commissioned artists to create Bay Area-themed Valentines for those scrambling to find something cute for their loved ones at the last minute. They might not be diamond rings, but we promise these new works are smile-inducing. \nPlease feel free to download and share with anyone you want.\n\nFirst up, here’s “You Had Me At Hella” by local muralist Kristin Farr. Farr is a former KQED employee — she’s the creator of our wonderful Art School video series — who now works at both Facebook and Juxtapoz Magazine. In her spare time she travels to far off locations like the Philippines and Hawaii to paint humongous murals in her mission to make the world a more beautiful place. Check out more of her work at her website, kristinfarr.com . \n\nNext is “You’re the Bay to my Breakers” by Menlo Park native Cameron Murfit. Murfit is a portrait artist and surface designer living in San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood, and her valentine is a tribute to her favorite (uniquely San Franciscan) event. Visit her website crookedhillsf.com to see more of her work. \n\nKen Nash, who describes himself as “full service media agency,” has created work for important organizations such as UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund. He was kind enough to donate the wonderful work above, “My Heart Quakes For You.” Make sure to take a moment and check out his website at kennash.com .\n\nKim Roth of Oakland made our next Valentine, “You Are the Treasure on my Island.” She runs Bright Room Studio, a boutique stationery studio that creates paper goods “for life’s biggest and best moments.” See more of her fantastic work at her website, brightroomstudiodesign.com .\n\nSan Francisco-based graphic designer Ellen Sherrod created our next card, “My Love for You is SUTRO (so true).” Sherrod is apparently able to do anything from website design to illustration, and her long list of clients include Apple, Glide Memorial Church and National Geographic Society. See her work at her website, ellensherrod.com . \n\nOur sixth valentine is an illustration called “You are the Butter on my $4.00 Toast” from artist Carolyn Wachnicki, who recently moved to the Bay Area. In the past she’s worked with a diverse range of clientele, from Monster Energy Drink to comedian Eugene Mirman. To see more of her work, her portfolio is at rockpaperc.xyz . \nBonus GIF! \nKQED Archivist Robert Chehoski has worked at the station for over five years and in his spare time, he makes amazing GIFs like the one above. To see more of his work, check out his Giphy page .\n\nIf you would like to create a Valentine for 2018, please email kjones(at)kqed.org with “Valentine 2018” in the subject.
