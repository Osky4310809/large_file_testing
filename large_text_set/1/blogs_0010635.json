Close A Cleveland Clinic doctor’s blog and President-elect Trump’s meeting with an anti-vaccination leader may be indications the movement against vaccines is rebounding. \nGroups that oppose universal vaccines are getting a booster shot this week in both the medical and political worlds. \nOver the weekend, a doctor at the well-respected Cleveland Clinic posted a blog on the clinic’s website. \nIn it, Dr. Daniel Neides, director and chief operating officer of the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, stated that ingredients in vaccines are potentially harmful and may contribute to increases in neurological conditions such as autism. \nIn addition, on Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump met with Robert Kennedy, Jr. Afterward, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to chair a new commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity. \nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) immediately issued a statement reiterating its support for vaccines. \nThe American Medical Association (AMA) also weighed in late today. \n\"We are deeply concerned that creating a new commission on vaccination safety would cause unnecessary confusion and adversely impact parental decision-making and immunization practices,\" a statement from the AMA said. [I hope] we can all get on one side.” Louise Kuo Habakus, Fearless Parent \nKennedy, however, told reporters the commission will allow society to “debate the science” of vaccination. \nThat view was echoed by Louise Kuo Habakus, the founder and executive director of Fearless Parent . \nHabakus told Healthline the current debate over vaccines “shuts out” a lot of points of view on vaccines. \nShe is hopeful the blog and the Kennedy commission will spur discussion so that “we can all get on one side.” When this happens, the public perception of science, physicians, and medicine goes down, and that is tragic. Cynthia Leifer, Cornell University \nHer group is hosting a forum on Jan. 24 in New Jersey entitled A Conversation About Childhood Vaccination . The sold-out event will be attended by about 400 people. Kennedy is listed as one of the speakers. \nAll this activity has supporters of vaccines worried. \nCynthia Leifer, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Cornell University, told Healthline the incidents undermine the factual evidence that backs up the necessity and safety of vaccines. \n“When this happens, the public perception of science, physicians, and medicine goes down, and that is tragic,” Leifer said. \nRead more: Understanding opposition to vaccines » What the doctor said \nIn his blog, Neides said he was inspired to write about the issue because he became seriously ill 12 hours after receiving a flu shot. \nHe called this part of “the constant toxic burden” the government unleashes on the public as people are “lined up like cattle and injected with an unsafe product.” \nNeides included the air, water, and food supplies in this “toxic soup.” Neides also mentioned the mostly debunked theory that childhood vaccines can cause autism. \nThe Cleveland Clinic doctor said he didn’t know if that claim is true, but said infants are being “overburdened with preservatives and adjuvants in the vaccines.” \nThe mention of the autism theory brought out an immediate and harsh response from supporters of vaccines. \nSome went as far as to call Neides a “quack,” while others criticized him for bringing up a theory they say has been widely disproven. “[The doctor’s] views do not reflect the position of Cleveland Clinic and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. Cleveland Clinic statement \nThe day after the blog appeared, officials at the Cleveland Clinic released a statement saying they are committed to “evidence-based medicine,” and support vaccinations. \n“Our physician published his statement without authorization from Cleveland Clinic. His views do not reflect the position of Cleveland Clinic and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken,” the statement read. \nThe clinic did not specify what the disciplinary action would be. \nNeides released his own statement the same day, saying, “I apologize and regret publishing a blog that has caused so much concern and confusion for the public and medical community. I fully support vaccinations and my concern was meant to be positive around the safety of them.” \nLeifer said she was concerned Neides criticized vaccines without backing up his claim with scientific studies or anecdotal evidence. \nShe added the furor over the blog might deter medical officials who support vaccines to speak out publically. \n“I think it scares them more than it empowers them,” Leifer said. \nHabakus, on the other hand, said the thing that frightens her is the reaction to the blog. \nShe said the criticism of Neides and the description of his blog as “an anti-vax rant” have hurt public discourse on the issue. \nHabakus said Neides is “not alone” in the medical profession in his concerns over vaccinations, and all voices need to be heard. \n“It’s dangerous when only certain flavors of people are allowed to speak,” she said. \nRead more: Pediatricians say DeNiro was right to pull anti-vaccination movie from film festival » The debate may get louder \nThe discussion of vaccines may get more intense this year after Trump takes office and the Kennedy commission convenes. \nThe President-elect has made statements in the past expressing concerns about vaccine safety. \nOn Tuesday, AAP officials felt compelled to release a statement in support of vaccines. \n“Pediatricians partner with parents to provide the best care for their children, and what is best for children is to be fully vaccinated. We stand ready to work with the White House and the federal government to share the extensive scientific evidence demonstrating the safety of vaccines, including the recommended schedule,” the statement read. \nLeifer said she has “grave concerns” about the presidential commission and the message it sends. This is a conversation that needs to be occurring. Louise Kuo Habakus, Fearless Parent \n“It legitimizes and validates what [vaccine opponents] think,” she said. \nHabakus, however, said she hopes the commission can help bring people together. \n“This is a conversation that needs to be occurring,” she said. \nShe noted that people who opposed the amount of radiation in X-rays in the early 1900s were ostracized for their views and were eventually proven right when those levels were reduced. \nHabakus said vaccines do sicken and injure some people. \nShe added the core issue is about choice. Parents should be able to prevent their children from being vaccinated if they feel it is unsafe. \nShe noted there is a school of thought that it is better to let children get measles, mumps, and chicken pox when they are young because their natural immune system builds up a better defense than do vaccines. \n“People should have choices,” she said. When a parent chooses not to vaccinate they endanger their child and all the children around them. Cynthia Leifer, Cornell University \nThat’s an argument that Leifer doesn’t buy. \n“We have child car seat laws, and when a parent chooses not to follow them they endanger their child, but when a parent chooses not to vaccinate they endanger their child and all the children around them. We should stand firm on vaccine requirements for children to attend schools,” she said. \nShe added that society seems to have “social amnesia” when it comes to vaccines. Two generations ago, the public was frightened by the spread of diseases such as polio, and strongly supported vaccinations. \n“The bottom line is I believe vaccines save lives,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T03:27:23.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
