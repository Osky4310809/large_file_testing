Over the years, the current TNT basketball analyst has referred to Bayless as a \"punk,\" an \"idiot\" and \"the biggest jackass in the history of journalism.\" \nBut Barkley went all in against Bayless during a broad-ranging interview on The Dan Patrick Show on Thursday, revealing to Dan Patrick a dying wish that involves the Fox Sports 1 host. \n\"You know what we should do for ratings? If I get a disease and I'm going to die, how about you get Skip Bayless in here and I'll kill him live on national television,\" Barkley joked, adding that he just wants to get the outspoken host in a room one time and \"beat him like a dog.\" \n\"So you'd kill him,\" Patrick shot back. \n\"Yes. Only if I knew I was going to die. Not if I'm gonna live, 'cause I don't want go to prison,\" Barkley responded. \"Because like [former Sixer Rick] Mahorn says, 'They would love you in prison.' \" \nWatch (starts around the 40:50 mark): \nBayless did not respond to a request for comment. \nSurprisingly, it's not the first time Barkley has mentioned his desire to murder Bayless. During a 2009 appearance on The Tonight Show , Barkley told host Jay Leno that Bayless, then with ESPN, was \" one of the two people I'd like to kill. \" \nA few years later, Barkley told his co-hosts on Inside the NBA , \"If I could get Skip Bayless in a room, you'd need DNA to find out who he was.\" | Updated: \nthe Inquirer, the Daily News and Philly.com have uncovered corruption in local and state public offices, shed light on hidden and dangerous environmental risks, and deeply examined the region’s growing heroin epidemic.
