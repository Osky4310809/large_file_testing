Theresa May field questions (Photo: Getty) \nAnd children from poorer backgrounds are already suffering the most as they are less likely to make good progress at secondary school than better-off youngsters, according to a new warning from the Government’s Social Mobility Commission today. \nSkint schools in crisis over £2.5bn Tory cuts as true scale of blitz on budgets is revealed \nThe IFS report says: “This will be the first time schools have seen real-terms cuts in spending per pupil since the mid-1990s.” \nOne deputy head involved in drawing up school budgets feared cuts of 6.5% could see two more children in every class. \nRecent figures show primary classes had an average of 27.1 children, with and 20.4 in each secondary class. Primary School Children Chasing Each Other in a School Playground (Photo: Getty) \nAn expert told the Mirror the scale of the cuts could see primary class sizes rise by 2.1 pupils, and add an extra three kids to secondary classes. \nThat would see an average of 23.4 children in secondary classes and 29.2 in primary classes - close to the politically significant level of 30 per class.

Read More Theresa May's family coat of arms revealed - the same privilege enjoyed by David Cameron \nIt describes the situation as “one of the great injustices” of the education system. \nSince 2012, pupils from low-income families have made less progress year-on-year than classmates from wealthier families, research by LKMco and Education Datalab based on National Pupil Database data shows. \nThe gulf is worst for poor white children, with most low-income ethnic minority groups making progress in line with the national average - partly because ethnic minority parents provide more effective home support. \nSocial Mobility Commission chair and Labour former Cabinet Minister Alan Milburn said: “One of the shocking features of our education system is that the gap between poor pupils and their better-off peers increases during their time in school rather than reducing. \n“This new research suggests that the progress they make in primary school is all but wiped out during secondary. \n“The consequence is that successive generations of poor kids are being let down by a school system that is supposed to be there to help them move up and get on.” \nMany schools have found themselves in debt in recent years after council-controlled schools were allowed to borrow money to plug gaps under David Cameron ’s government. \nThe amount they were given permission to borrow rose from £35.8million to £51.7million between 2013-14 and 2014-15. School children at work in a classroom (Photo: PA) \nBut many have been unable to repay their loans and, with teaching staff making up 80% of a school’s costs, unions fears jobs could be cut. \nResearch shows the biggest spending rises over the last 20 years have been on schoolchildren in England, with £4,900 currently spent on each primary school pupil and £6,300 spent per secondary student. \nGovernment statistics last September showed a total of 8.56 million pupils in schools in England - an increase of just over 121,000 pupils, or 1.4%, in 12 months. \n“The total number of pupils has grown every year since 2009 and there are now 467,265 more pupils in schools than at that point,” it said. \nFurther education is also facing huge cuts as funding for sixth formers by 2020 will be the same as it was 30 years ago - at the end of Margaret Thatcher’s reign, respected think tank the IFS calculates. \nFurther education (FE) Colleges face an ongoing budget squeeze, with spending per student plummeting by 6.7% between 2010/11 and 2015/16 and a further drop of 6.5% expected over the next few years. Educating Essex (Photo: Channel 4) \nIt means that funding for 16-18-year-olds is no higher than it was almost 30 years ago. \nReport author and IFS associate director Luke Sibieta said: “Over the next few years, both further education and schools are due to experience cuts. \n“For schools, this comes on the back of very significant increases over the last few decades. \n“For FE, this comes on the back of tight funding settlements for decades that will leave spending per student the same in 2020 as it was in 1990. \n“The lack of priority given to FE by successive governments in spending settlements does not seem sustainable.” \nA Department for Education spokesman said: “School funding is now at its highest level on record at more than £40billion in 2016-17 and the IFS has shown that by 2020 per pupil spending in schools is set to be at least 70% higher in real terms than it was in 1990. \n“We are transforming post-16 education and investing £7billion to ensure there is a place in education or training for every 16 to 19-year-old who wants one.” Cash-strapped head to do marathon to raise cash rather than sack teacher \nEarlier this month, Derbyshire headmaster Dave Shaw revealed he was competing in the Great North Run to raise money for Spire Junior School in Chesterfield, which faces a £17,000 funding cut. \nHe said: “We have had to cut staff and various other things, and the next thing would be Year 6 visits, but that’s something we really want to keep hold of. \n“Costs are going up regarding National Insurance contributions and pension contributions, and we are just getting the same amount of income coming in, so we are losing more and more. \n“I’m struggling with how we will do this in the future.” \nDave’s local MP, Labour’s Toby Perkins, highlighted the school’s plight to Theresa May at Prime Minister’s Questions. \nBut the Tory leader told him: “What the government has brought forward is a consultation on a fairer funding formula. \n“We will look at the results of the fairer funding formula consultation and will bring forward our firm proposals in due course.” Dave Shaw is the headteacher of a cash-strapped school \nOn his Just Giving fundraising page Mr Shaw writes: \n“As Headteacher of Spire Junior School, I will be running the Great North Run in order to raise funds to subsidise school visits for the children at my school. \nWe have 70% of our children on free school meals and are situated in an area of high socio-economic deprivation. Due to funding cuts, and increases in costs we’re finding it increasingly difficult to run the school without running into a deficit. \nUnder the new funding formula we will lose £17,000 of our budget and by 2020 the forecast is a loss of £99,000. I’ve had to lose one teacher and one teaching assistant, my deputy is now needed to teach full time, and I’m teaching part time, to save money. \n“Our staff do a fantastic job and go above and beyond for the children and families of this school. If I lost anymore staff then I feel the quality of education our children currently receive would suffer. I have therefore looked at how to cut costs and have had to make some difficult decisions, which has included cutting back subsidies for school visits. \n“I’m trying to be proactive in plugging the funding gap with donations and sponsorship from completing the Great North Run. As we are not a charity this page has been set up as a crowdfunding opportunity. \n“For more information about the school please visit our website www.spirejunior.co.uk We hope you’re able to support the fantastic children and families at our school.” How badly off could our schools be? \nWhy are schools losing money? School budgets are failing to keep pace with inflation, meaning rising prices outstrip the amount of cash they have to spend. A new funding formals will also see some schools robbed of hundreds of thousands of pounds. \nHow badly off will they be? A report from Whitehall spending watchdog the National Audit Office suggested schools will have to cut £3billion by 2019-20 at a time when pupil numbers are climbing and real terms cash per-pupil is falling. Today’s report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies is the latest study to highlight the looming funding crisis. \nWill some schools gain? Ministers claims half will benefit under the “fairer” formula. But critics say the pot from which money is shared out is not big enough. \nWhere can I find out more? The SchoolCuts.org.uk website provides a calculator setting out how badly each school could be clobbered. The Government has also set up a website where users can discover the potential impact of the new formula.
