Josh Murray and Amanda Stanton both confirmed to Us Weekly last month that they had ended their engagement , and now Murray tells Us exclusively that it hasn't been easy for him to put the relationship behind him . Amanda Stanton and Josh Murray attend 102.7 KIIS FM's Jingle Ball in 2016. Rachel Murray/Getty Images PHOTOS: Celebrity Splits of 2016 \nMurray, 32, spoke with Us at a Love Bites event at STK Miami on Tuesday, February 14, and said that it's been \"tough\" to get back to his life after splitting with Stanton, 26. (The couple got engaged during the Bachelor in Paradise season 3 finale over the summer; Murray returned to Atlanta following the breakup, after having moved to Southern California to be with the esthetician and her two daughters, Kinsley, 4, and Charlie, 3.) PHOTOS: ‘Bachelor’ and ‘Bachelorette’ Babies \n\"Definitely an adjustment because Amanda had two kids, and I got attached to them,\" the Bachelorette season 10 winner says. \"Hardest part of being single now is I miss them — I got attached to the little ones. We had a great time, some amazing times — we had ups and downs, like in any relationship, and unfortunately, it didn't work out. We learned a lot about each other after the show.\" Amanda Stanton and Josh Murray in 'Bachelor in Paradise' Rick Rowell/ABC via Getty Images PHOTOS: The Bachelor After the Final Rose: Broken Engagements, Weddings, Babies, and More! \nThe former baseball player doesn't rule out a possible reconciliation for the pair down the road —\"I don't know what the future holds,\" he says — but he points out that he and the Bachelor season 20 standout remain in contact. \"We definitely stay in touch, and I stay in touch with Charlie,\" Murray says. \"She's a sweetheart. I think I may see her when I head to L.A. this week. It's back and forth just a little bit — I don't like to end relationships and not be friends with people.\" \nMurray — who ended his nine-month engagement to Andi Dorfman in January 2015 — doesn't blame himself solely for the split from Stanton. But he acknowledges his role in their issues: \"After two failed engagements, you hear all these things on how things are your fault and what you did wrong, and women especially always take Amanda's side. [But] I have to take responsibility — it's both people who were at fault. I will always take responsibility.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:21:52.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
