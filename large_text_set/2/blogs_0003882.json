Why didn’t I go with them?’ \n“We came here and I think nobody thought we would go so far.” \nCameroon came from behind to beat Egypt 2-1 in the final, with Vincent Aboukakar scoring an 88th-minute winner. Matip remained with Liverpool having quit the international scene (Photo: Julian Finney) \nMatip, 25, last played for his country in an AFCON qualifier in September 2015 and rejected a call-up to Broos’ squad for the tournament in Gabon. \nHe is understood to be adamant that his position will not change despite his country’s success. \nThe former Schalke centre-back was one of seven players to pull out of the provisional 35-man squad. Others included West Brom’s Allan Nyom.
