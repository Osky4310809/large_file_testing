That was not the notable part. His dance to celebrate the three-pointer was.\nYup, that’s some good, old-fashioned celebration pelvic thrusting.\nNow, there are a lot of variations of thrusting celebrations in sports. What Young does here is not what we would call the “Von Miller.”\nSee, the “Von Miller” features much more authoritative thrusts. Young went with a rapidfire technique that is actually an NBA staple. It’s called the “Lance Stephenson.”\nIn classic Young style, he put a little twist on the move and started his thrusting before the shot went in. At least this time went a little better than some of his previous premature celebrations.
