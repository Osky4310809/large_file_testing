But here we are in February 2017 and it’s still not officially out. \nWith the meta feeling a little stale, and queue times getting longer, I sat down with Hines again this week to chat about Bethesda’s plans for Legends.

I also asked him about whether he worries that developer Dire Wolf may be distracted by working on multiple card games at once (they’re also behind Eternal ).
