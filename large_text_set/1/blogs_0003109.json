Dave Hyde emerges from behind the curtain for a few seconds inside Miami Dolphins camp in sweat suit and reading glasses. He'll saunter through the locker room, and maybe nod a greeting, in a cameo that makes visitors do a double-take.\nA few weeks ago, when quarterback T.J. Yates signed with the Dolphins, he was surprised to see Marino in the hallway, then even more when the Hall of Famer sat in during the quarterbacks meeting. \nLike most newcomers, Yates had no idea Marino worked inside the team. Like most outsiders, he felt momentarily star-struck. \n\"It's Dan Marino sitting there,\" Yates said. \nWhat does Marino do there? He's a football grunt, just as he enjoys. He watches video. He studies schemes. He sits in meetings and offers ideas, though Dolphins coach Adam Gase said, \"You have to, to ask him what he would think or how he would see it, because he won't just … he's not overbearing in that way.

He has no office inside the Dolphins facility – nor does he apparently need one (\"They'd know when I'm not working,\" he has joked with friends). \nTake a look at our annual countdown of the most noteworthy player to wear each of the numbers of the Miami Dolphins, from 99 down to 1. Mostly, they are players who clearly excelled on the field, but there are the occasional outliers, in the mix for an oddity, or even an off-the-field incident. In the latest update after the 2015 season, there are four new additions, plus two honorable mentions are also listed for each number. (Steve Svekis) \nHe isn't a centerpiece of coaching strategy or public attention – nor does he ever want to be. He agreed to, then declined an interview about his role, saying, \"There's really no need to talk about it.\" \n\"Special Advisor to the President and CEO\" is the official title Marino has had with the Dolphins the past three seasons. That's for his business-side duties, though, where he glad-hands team sponsors and appears with owner Steve Ross and other team executives at games. \nThis is the first season Marino has worked on the football side. Previous coach Joe Philbin discouraged former greats – Marino, Jason Taylor, anyone – from having much of a voice with players. Gase values it. \n\"He's a good sounding board, especially for the quarterbacks,\" Gase said. \"I've always enjoyed talking to him because he has a great perspective of anything we've ever discussed. \n\"I've always liked watching film with him and getting his two cents on things. … He's seen so much football over his time, and he always gives the quarterbacks a piece of advice that seems so small at the time. It's a big deal because it's the way he saw it, and the way he saw things was special.\" \nEveryone agrees, he's a background voice. He'll offer strategic thoughts or, occasionally, toss out a pet phrase from his passing style like, \"Pick a guy and let it fly.\" \nOnce, during training camp, he put on a black-and-white video from his younger days, \"where he had a big Afro and was doing some drill throwing balls against a wall,\" rookie, reserve quarterback Brandon Doughty said. \"Everyone got a laugh out of it.\" \nDoughty was a senior at North Broward Prep when he first met Marino. The team's coach, Jeff Dellenbach, was Marino's teammate with the Dolphins and asked him to help Doughty. \nFor a couple of days, Marino showed footwork drills, honed techniques and suggested Doughty do something to improve in-the-pocket foot speed that he once did in his youth: Jump rope. \nStill, Doughty says it's, \"kind of surreal,\" to have Marino sitting there in meetings. \nHe's a presence, if an understated one, around the larger team, too. Players talk with him, joke with him. Receiver Jarvis Landry says a running joke with Marino is, \"how different things are now than when he played. Like he looks at our lockers with all these cleats and says he only had one pair of cleats in his locker.\" \nGuard Jermon Bushrod says Marino sits down with everyone and, \"talks just like everyone else does about what's going on. It's pretty cool, him being a Hall of Famer, just having him around and knowing what he's done.\" \nMarino has no designs or desire to eventually lead the Dolphins like his one-time rival and friend, John Elway , in Denver. He likes this contained role, those who know him best say. He's happy being on the inside talking football and speaking the language of quarterbacks. \nIf his voice is a reserved one inside the team, his larger name isn't. When Yates joined the team, he went to get a jersey from the equipment staff. \n\"What's your number?\" he was asked. \n\"That's not going to work,\" he said. \nYates took No. 16. \nHis desired No. 13 is retired with the Dolphins. \nFollow Dave Hyde on Twitter here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T03:58:39.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
