Jeff Bottari, The Associated Press Peyton Manning speaks at Adobe Summit 2017 in Las Vegas. \nPeyton Manning, the former quarterback turned professional speaker, tried to set the record straight Wednesday, as a keynote speaker at Adobe Summit 2017 in Las Vegas. \nSince retiring from the NFL in March 2016, Manning has been the subject of much speculation about his next career, which has ranged from potentially joining the Colts' front office (he didn't) to running for the U.S. Senate. Advertisement \nSen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is reported to be weighing retirement instead of running for a fourth term in 2020, and Manning's name has been floated as a potential candidate . \n“I don't know where that came from. Last week I was going to run a team, this week I going to apparently run for Senate, and next week I'll be an astronaut,\" Manning said. \"I have no interest in the political world, but would like to continue serving communities.” \nManning said he's \"excited about the next chapter of my career\" and that he has \"a bucket list\" of things he wants to do before finding something new. \n\"The best advice I got was to not sign up for something full-time right away that you can't commit to,\" he said. \"I'm taking my time and seeing what my options might be.” \nMore from Manning's talk at Adobe Summit: \nOn what he misses about playing: \n“I miss the camaraderie of teammates. You do everything together. You practice together, you eat together, you sit in these team meetings together. And I miss the plane rides after a win.” \nOn \"Omaha\" (again): \n— Kaushal Mall (@_kaushalmall) March 22, 2017 \nOn Ray Lewis, whom Manning has said dealt him the hardest hit in his career: \n\"He was so explosive and fast. He would say to me, ‘I'll be back here in a couple minutes, punk.' The day he retired was the greatest day of my life.\" \nOn hosting \"Saturday Night Live\": \n\"One of the things people ask me about the most is the skit for the United Way. I remember the skit involved me throwing footballs at kids. It was a Nerf football and light as a feather, but with those sound effects, it sounded like I was knocking these kids out. I remember thinking, ‘I can't do it, my mother's going to be so disappointed in me,' and right when I was about to cancel, a mother of a child actor ran out and said ‘I want him to hit my kid in the face!'” Peyton Manning speaks at the 6th annual NFL Honors at the Wortham Center on Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017, in Houston.
