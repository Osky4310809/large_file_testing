The non-contact injury happened to the same knee that Parker suffered an torn ACL to in Jan. 2015, and it’s a very bad sign that he wasn’t able to put weigh on it leaving the game.\nThe Milwaukee Bucks officially announced the injury as a sprained knee and said Parker will not return, per their Twitter. \nHere’s video of the injury. You can clearly see Parker plant, his knee give way and him react in pain.\nParker played nearly all of his sophomore season, suiting up for 76 games during a healthy season after recovering from the torn ACL. Parker was having his best season as a pro this year, playing in 50 games and averaging slight more than 20 points per game.\nThe timing could not be more unfortunate, with Khris Middleton — who was injured before the year — making his return this game and the Bucks looking forwards to finally fielding a healthy roster again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:02:57.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
