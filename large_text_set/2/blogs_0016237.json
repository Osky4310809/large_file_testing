I'm a woman. I am somebody who is heavily reliant on Obama's pre-existing condition clause,\" Kian explained to the CNN host. \"I don't think that it's fair to judge me for not wanting somebody who criticizes me for the things that I identify with.\"\nKian was looking for a roommate for her home near Georgetown University and posted an ad on Craigslist, CNN reported over the weekend.\n\"Alcohol, pets, and meat products are not allowed in the house,\" Kian wrote. \"Neither are Trump supporters.\"\nShe stood by her ban on Trump supporters on Saturday.\n\"So no, I would feel like I'm in a hostile environment if me and my roommates, who are immigrants, felt unwelcome by Trump, his supporters, and the policies that are discriminatory,\" Kian said.\n\"But you're being judgmental against what they believe in,\" Smerconish pushed back.\nAfter explaining that her home is not a \"political battlefield,\" Kian argued that her Craigslist post was not politically discriminatory.\n\"This is not about political differences,\" she said. \"It doesn't say ‘no conservatives' in my ad; it doesn't say ‘no Republicans;' it doesn't say ‘no Christians;' it says ‘no Trump supporters.'\n\"There is a distinction between Republican, conservative, and a Trump supporter,\" Kian added.\n\"A Trump supporter by all means is a bigot. So instead of saying ‘no bigots in my apartment,' I specifically say ‘no Trump supporters' because I am calling Trump and his supporters out on their bigotry.\"\nThe post Woman Who Posted ‘No Trump Supporters’ Craigslist Ad for Roommate: ‘A Trump Supporter by All Means Is a Bigot’ appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:52:12.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
