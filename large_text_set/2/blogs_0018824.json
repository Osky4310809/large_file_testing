I've got 30 WhatsApps, all like, 'Congrats.' \n\"I can't bring myself to reply because what can I say? I've not got the job, it's embarrassing. But fingers crossed!

If my boyfriend looked down when we were having sex and saw I had a better six-pack than him, I imagine he'd lose his erection.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:46:02.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
