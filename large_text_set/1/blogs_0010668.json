Facebook has also been under fire from those in the media industry for its role in controlling access to readers without providing much in the way of monetization.\nJust last week, Facebook named a new head of news partnerships — Campbell Brown — who is tasked with serving as a liaison with publishers as well as the public face of Facebook's news efforts.\nThe initiative announcement is divided into three parts: collaboration, tools/education for journalists and tools/education for the public.\nIn collaboration, Facebook noted that it has heard publishers want to package stories together. Though light on details, the initial idea sounds something like a digital magazine or newspaper disseminated through Facebook.\n\"Publishers simply choose the articles and a cover image or video to package together in a set of Instant Articles,\" wrote Facebook product manager Josh Roberts in a blog post about the new magazine-like format .\nFacebook published the image below as an example of what multiple stories from one publisher could look like.\nImage: Facebook\nIn addition to the new Instant Articles format, Simo said that Facebook also wants to help with improving the prospects of local news. Local media outlets have been particularly hard hit in recent years as the economics of media have changed.\nAs for tools and education for journalists, Facebook will be introducing a \"certificate curriculum\" in partnership with the Poynter Institute for Media Studies for journalists that complete its courses on how to best use Facebook.\nFacebook will also be making CrowdTangle, the Facebook audience tracking startup that it recently bought, free for publishing partners.\nAs for the broader public, Facebook will be working with outside organizations \"on how to better understand and to promote news literacy both on and off our platform to help people in our community have the information they need to make decisions about which sources to trust.\"\nTo that end, Facebook said it is working with Arizona State University to figure out how to support this goal, as well as working with the News Literacy Project to make public service ads on the issue.\nLastly, Facebook said it will continue efforts to \"reduce the spread of news hoaxes — including ways for people to report them more easily and new efforts to disrupt the financial incentives for spammers.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/", "https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/facebook-journalism-project/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Y-elz27_ORdNqQ5hdxFw8OAOzss=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F344746%2Ff4e109d7-0787-4c5f-88a7-b98e7580f31f.jpg", "https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/multiple-instant-articles/", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/R1dh5y_H4L0_wvyY_FsMvjySP9k=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F344746%2Ff4e109d7-0787-4c5f-88a7-b98e7580f31f.jpg"], "published": "2017-01-11T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T17:41:11.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
