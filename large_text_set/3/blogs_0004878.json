Miranda shows how chic (and cold-weather appropriate) it can look when paired with leather skinnies, a cropped sweater and a low heel. 9 of 92 BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images \nNAOMI WATTS \nIn our next life, we'd love to be rocking the newest bag from Chanel before it hits stores with slides and a cute blazer. But in this one, we can still pull together this perfect-for-work outfit (wear her $60 Vans slides to commute, then swap in heels) with stuff from our closet (like her Etnia Barcelona shades ), no celebrity connections required. 10 of 92 Phillip Faraone/Patrick McMullan via Getty \nSARAH PAULSON \nThe silhouettes (the jacket, the A-line skirt, the Tamara Mellon pumps ) are all understated - it's the details (the leopard print, the sheer panels, the multiple straps) that makes this outfit both sexy and memorable. 11 of 92 ZUMA \nJORDANA BREWSTER \nJeans with a shredded hem (like her Madewell pair ) are surprisingly versatile, as long as you can flash a little skin. We like the way she teamed hers with stacked sandals and a leather jacket, but an ankle bootie would work well too. 12 of 92 \nJULIANNE HOUGH \nPlay up the sporty vibe of a striped dress by picking a flat with an athletic silhouette, tying a button-up around your waist and going hands-free with a bag like her FashionABLE crossbody . 13 of 92 BG005/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images \nJENNA DEWAN-TATUM \nBodysuits aren't just for Kardashian-esque, super-sexy outfits. Jenna gives her Danskin leotard a weekend-ready vibe with a long, cozy duster and distressed jeans, and keeps things polished with impeccable accessories (including squeaky-clean white sneakers and a Senreve bag ). 14 of 92 \nAUBREY PLAZA \nAubrey wore her Elizabeth and James dress ( available here in white ) with heels on TV, but we actually like the fresh feeling of the chic Tory Burch Oxfords and Lavish Alice coat she added to step out of the studio. 15 of 92 Splash News Online \nMANDY MOORE \nThough Mandy typically loves to pair her leather jackets with jeans and a tee, we love the \"Pink Lady\" vibe this Kate Spade New York topper lends to her Alice + Olivia bustier and skirt, Atelier Longchamp clutch and matching Jimmy Choo heels (worn with Wolford tights and a swipe of red lipstick for a perfectly polished touch). 16 of 92 Timur Emek/GC Images \nOLIVIA PALERMO \nLeather pants like Olivia's Paige pair don't automatically have to be super-nighttime. With an oversized blazer, trendy scarf and classic Jimmy Choo booties , they're as versatile and comfortable as jeans. 17 of 92 Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock \nEMMY ROSSUM \nThe intricate lacework on the sleeves and hem - which reminds us of paper snowflakes! - makes a white dress even more winter-appropriate. And suede accessories are excellent seasonal accents. 18 of 92 \nOLIVIA CULPO \nA high-neck dress packs plenty of wow factor when it comes in a clingy knit and bombshell shade, like this lipstick-red midi. And yes, red can be hard to accessorize - but we think Olivia nailed it in her two tone beige-and-gold heels and matching gold clutch. 19 of 92 \nKATE UPTON \nThe Sports Illustrated Swim cover girl makes covering up look just as sexy as a bikini, thanks to her blend of textures (a furry Thakoon coat , ruffled top, second-skin Stephanie Rad leather pants and glossy Tamara Mellon boots .) 20 of 92 Earl Gibson III/Getty \nISSA RAE \nThe Insecure star plays up the beachy vibes of her embroidered halter with a pearlescent aqua Edie Parker clutch, opal earrings by Dvani (with rings by Le Vian and John Hardy) and an off-center half bun. 21 of 92 Dave Benett/Getty \nKATE BOSWORTH \nGot a dress that's super twee, like Kate does (hers is Woody Woodpecker x House of Holland)? Ground it with minimal makeup and chunky boots. 22 of 92 Frank Sullivan/Splash News \nCHARLIZE THERON \nWant to give major \"incognito movie star\" vibes no matter where you're going? Take a cue from Charlize, who wears a monochromatic outfit (including L'Agence leather leggings , a silk top and Saint Laurent bag ) with luxe extras, from her cat-eye shades to Anita Ko earrings to her perfectly on-point pumps. 23 of 92 Pierre Suu/GC Images \nSELENA GOMEZ \nOn the other side of the \"movie star\" spectrum is Selena, who is unmissable in her floral print party dress, Coach varsity jacket , ankle-strap stilettos and ruby-tinted Garrett Leight x Clare V. frames . 24 of 92 AKM-GSI \nCAMILLA BELLE \nGreat boots and a bag make even the easiest outfit - a slouchy turtleneck and a bun - feel deliberate. 25 of 92 INSTARimages \nKARLIE KLOSS \nA full leather skirt is feminine but tough, and classic add-ons like a striped tee and single-sole pumps are the perfect pieces to play up that vibe. 26 of 92 Sam Deitch/BFA/REX/Shutterstock \nJENNY SLATE \nDying for a pair of statement booties but not sure what to wear them with? You can't go wrong with a classic ringer tee and skinny jeans (everything she's wearing is Madewell). 27 of 92 \nCATE BLANCHETT \nOr if you're feeling a little bolder, pair your booties with a bunch of standout pieces - like Cate does with her lucite-heel pair, adding a head-turning handbag, cropped jacket and oversize Tod's shades . 28 of 92 FameFlynet \nAMY ADAMS \nYour perfect weekend errands-running outfit is here, and it's extra cute thanks to the pretty print top and just-right cuffed jeans. 29 of 92 Owen Kolasinski/BFA/REX/Shutterstock \nCHANEL IMAN \nWith strappy Stella Luna heels, Chanel's silky wrap top and high-waisted cropped pants (actually a jumpsuit that, like her coat, is Elisabetta Franchi) are ready to party. Add pumps, though, and suddenly this is a fun Friday work outfit. 30 of 92 AKM-GSI \nALESSANDRA AMBROSIO \nAn outfit that is both cozy and sexy is a hard one to get right. But Alessandra nails it by paring this Rails sweaterdress with thigh-high Stuart Weitzman boots and a chic Les Petits Jouers bag . 31 of 92 \nMIRANDA KERR \nWhen you're taking the pair of jeans you designed out for a test drive, you want to get your outfit exactly right - and Miranda does just that, pairing her Miranda + Mother high-waist pair with a sheer striped top, logo belt and casually draped tuxedo jacket. 32 of 92 FameFlynet \nCHARLIZE THERON \nPerfect-fit black jeans ( hers are J Brand ) are by far the most versatile thing in your wardrobe - they can be dressed up or down, and add a little glamour to more menswear-inspired items like an oversize blazer or chunky boots. 33 of 92 MEGA \nKATE MARA \nYou may want to book a trip to somewhere warm just so you can wear this playful, picnic-inspired look. A girlie eyelet HVN dress takes on a tomboy edge with anoversized denim jacket and lace-up white sneakers. 34 of 92 Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock \nLOUISE ROE \nThough this jumpsuit would look equally cute dressed down with sneakers and studs, we love the way she glammed it up with a Jimmy Choo clutch and heels and long, on-trend statement earrings. 35 of 92 Robert Kamau/GC Images \nGIGI HADID \nShe designed that shearling coat with Tommy Hilfger , so she has a vested interest in making sure it looks good. And she achieves her goal by pairing it with some second-skin Frame moto leggings and a fuzzy clutch. 36 of 92 FameFlynet \nPRIYANKA CHOPRA \nFlorals on a white background look so right for February when they're in a slightly sparse print, like Priyanka's Marni dress, and paired with coordinating Christian Louboutin heels , a Ralph Lauren Collection coat and Garrett Leight sunglasses . 37 of 92 FameFlynet \nKATE HUDSON \nKate continues to singlehandedly work to make you want a pair of flare jeans like her J Brand pair - this time showing how sexy they can be with a plunging top, tuxedo blazer and a hint of leopard platform peeking out at the hem. 38 of 92 FameFlynet \nJESSICA BIEL \nWe bet you didn't know how much you need a striped coat until now - but after seeing the polished vibe it gives Jessica's loose separates (those Louise et Cie loafers and Oliver Peoples sunglasses help too), we don't know how we ever lived without one either. 39 of 92 FameFlynet \nLEA MICHELE \nBronze heels are the perfect unexpected accompaniment to a slightly boho print dress ( hers is Etro ). 40 of 92 Sonia Recchia/Getty \nKERRY WASHINGTON \nThought all-black would be boring? Kerry proves the key to a killer monochromatic look is mixing shapes and textures (and making sure her face is flawless, since it's the focal point of the look). 41 of 92 INSTAR \nJULIANNE HOUGH \nTwo style blogger staples - a half bun and an oversize cardigan - give a casual vibe to Julianne's otherwise sexy skintight J Brand jeans and over-the-knee boots. (And yes, that's a Fitbit she's wearing around her neck.) 42 of 92 AKM-GSI \nEMMA ROBERTS \nYou've got all the basic components of this outfit - the cropped peacoat, the striped tee, the skinny jeans (hers are Citizens of Humanity ), the classic black bag (hers is Senreve ). Isn't it time to invest in the outfit-making red booties too? 43 of 92 Splash News Online \nNINA DOBREV \nThe actress offsets the super-flirty hemline of her geometric-print Armani mini with a moto jacket draped over her shoulders and demure, chunky-heeled L.K. Bennett pumps . 44 of 92 Photographer Group / Splash News Online \nFREIDA PINTO \nShowing how well black jeans transition from work to weekend, the star tops hers with an ivory blouse, textured blazer and a red lip for a look that works as well on as off the clock. 45 of 92 Pacific Coast News \nKATE HUDSON \nShow off (or fake!) an hourglass shape by tucking a breezy knit into some high-waist flares. Kate plays up the retro vibe of her look with platform heels, round sunglasses and a Jimmy Choo messenger bag , but you could give it a totally different vibe with a braid, backpack and pointy heels. 46 of 92 Ray Tamarra/GC Images \nSARAH PAULSON \nNeed to make your trusty LBD pop? Do as Sarah does in her Co A-line dress : add high-shine metallic earrings (hers are Veronika Borchers x Pearl Collective ) and a chic print pump (like her Kurt Geiger London pair ). 47 of 92 Neil Warner / Splash News Online \nOLIVIA PALERMO \nWhen are leggings appropriate for air travel? When they're leather leggings (like Olivia's J Brand pair ). She wears hers with a slouchy Iris von Arnim turtleneck (cozy!) and sporty white jacket (brave, but we bet she's flying private!). 48 of 92 FameFlynet \nJESSICA BIEL \nGot $25? Then you can snag Jessica's perfect gray sweater from Forever 21 and wear it with, well, anything - though we love how she styled it with preppy classics including an Etienne Aigner tote and glossy black Louise et Cie loafers . 49 of 92 \nTERESA PALMER \nNavigating Sundance's \"cozy but chic\" dress code can be tricky. Teresa pulls it off effortlessly by layering a button-up between two supersoft knit pieces, then adding opaque Josie Natori tights and flat Tod's booties . 50 of 92 Bauer-Griffin/GC Images \nLUCY HALE \nThe Pretty Little Liars star makes jeans and a tee way more than just jeans and a tee thanks to her chic accessories, including a blush bomber, black boots and trendy Smoke x Mirrors sunglasses . 51 of 92 Jackson Lee/Splash News Online \nGABRIELLE UNION \nGabrielle is here to convince you that sandals are appropriate 365 days a year, especially if they are as cute as her \"Liloka\" Schutz style , which she pairs with cropped white trousers, a navy Vince turtleneck , matching coat and Haze sunglasses. 52 of 92 Splash News Online \nKOURTNEY KARDASHIAN \nThe more rips the better appears to be the KarJenner denim philosophy, as Kourtney proves true in her overly distressed jeans teamed with an AS by DF velvet blazer (sans shirt underneath), coordinating velvet booties and a Louis Vuitton backpack, for a '90s fashion fantasy come to life. 53 of 92 Starzfly/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images \nCHRISSY TEIGEN \nWhile some travel in their yoga pants and running sneakers, Chrissy travels in her striped draped ATM Collection sweater (on sale now!) , black skinnies, her chicest ankle boots, a Chanel bag and cool-girl fedora. 54 of 92 AKM-GSI \nABIGAIL SPENCER \nRunning errands looks effortlessly more chic when you're wearing a pair of leather pants, white Adidas sneakers, a striped La Ligne NYC shir t and the perfect bomber courtesy The Arrivals . But who are we kidding: Abigail's best accessory is her pup. 55 of 92 Splash News Online \nOLIVIA PALERMO \nThe star breaks a few style \"rules\" - wearing white in the winter, mixing opposites on the color wheel with her olive military overcoat and maroon Longchamp bag - and shows just how chic breaking the rules can look. 56 of 92 BG001/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images \nKENDALL JENNER \nLast year's cropped \"Mom Jeans\" work well into winter with a super-slouchy sweater, a crossbody and ankle booties, as the star (wearing Krewe sunglasses ) shows. 57 of 92 Ryan Turgeon/ Splash News Online \nKATIE HOLMES \nCamo looks super fresh in an unexpected silhouette like her bell-shaped coat, and her straight-leg jeans and gold-buckled loafers keep the whole look grounded and cool. 58 of 92 AKM-GSI \nCHRISTINA RICCI \nThe accents on her heels echo the buttons her Antonio Berardi dress, and the tweed coat and pearls pull it all together for a very classic feel. 59 of 92 Stefanie Keenan/Getty \nNICOLE RICHIE \nIf you're intrigued by the red carpet sweatshirt trend , here's an easy entry point: pair your super-sparkly number with ripped jeans and loafers (that have a little surprise shine on the heel) and add some flirty earrings to keep the whole look elevated. 60 of 92 Splash News Online \nLEA MICHELE \nThe moto-style zip on her Fay coat echoes the studded detailing on her booties - and contrasts with the super-cozy Aerie sweater and comfy American Eagle jeggings underneath. 61 of 92 Vince Flores/Startraks \nJAMIE CHUNG \nClassic basics are the best things to pair with a statement shoe like Jamie's gold Aska booties - a leather skirt and menswear-inspired blazer are just the right mix of easy and edgy. 62 of 92 MelMedia/GC Images \nFELICITY JONES \nThough her coat (with its velvet details and brass buttons) is super-formal, wearing it with jeans, booties and a lipstick-red purse makes it look more quirky and girlie. 63 of 92 \nCHANEL IMAN \nPro model tip: If you really want to get the most out of your oxblood fur-lined parka ( hers is Moose Knuckles ), wear it with a pair of booties in the same deep red shade. 64 of 92 Beretta/Sims/REX/Shutterstock \nNICOLE KIDMAN \nWant a holiday look that's dressy but still warm? Super dark-wash, slightly flared denim ( hers are Mother ), a black turtleneck and a strappy pare of pumps fits that bill. 65 of 92 Kevin Winter/Getty \nEMMA STONE \nIf you're still in a climate that will tolerate bare legs, you might as well make the most of it by picking sunny, citrus-y brights that play off each other (like her Giambattista Valli mini and tomato-red Tyler Ellis x Petra Flannery clutch). 66 of 92 SMXRF/Star Max/GC Images \nKATE BECKINSALE \nLeather pants ( Kate's are J Brand ) don't always to be edgy! When paired with a silky jacket and scarf-neck blouse, they're downright ladylike. 67 of 92 Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock \nGWYNETH PALTROW \nAnd regular leggings don't have to be relegated to the \"not pants\" pile - Gwyneth's $17.99 pair from H&M look totally chic when tucked into luxe knee-high boots and worn under a coat with rich, tactile cuffs. 68 of 92 MEGA \nSOFIA VERGARA \nJeans, a tee and a comfy cardigan ( hers is Karen Kane ) look great with pretty much any accessories under the sun - we like the mix of textures in her tan quilted bag and suede booties. 69 of 92 Bauer-Griffin \nEMMY ROSSUM \nA striped shirt is a timeless basic, but a striped turtleneck is the basic you need right now. 70 of 92 KCS Presse / Splash News Online \nALESSANDRA AMBROSIO \nA black turtleneck can be worn a million different ways, but we love the French girl-chic variation rocked by Alessandra here - the sheer maxi, chain-studded moto and geometric earrings make for one instant classic outfit. 71 of 92 AKM-GSI \nEMMA ROBERTS \nThis is how we always think we look when we walk out of the house all bundled up. The star is cute and cozy from her head (clad in a Max Mara beanie ) to her shoulders (in an Inhabit scarf, J Brand crop top , Express jacket and Elisabeth Weinstock purse ) to her knees and toes (wearing Dear Frances boots ). 72 of 92 Daniel Zuchnik/GC Images \nVICTORIA JUSTICE \nA hot pink soft wool trench like her Ted Baker style makes any outfit pop - but we like that she gave hers some \"Grease\" vibes with leather pants, sassy Sam Edelman heels and cat-eye Jonathan Adler shades . 73 of 92 FameFlynet \nMANDY MOORE \nA striped tee and cigarette pants is the perfect base for tons of outfits. From there, you can add quirky accessories, like Mandy's backless red loafers, cheery tiered jacket and Perverse sunglasses . 74 of 92 Alessio Botticelli/FilmMagic \nMINDY KALING \nMindy may be filming Ocean's Eight, but she is also giving you your work outfit inspiration for the week. We love the way the cherry red of her blouse and belt coordinates with her coat, and the black pumps are all business but would work equally well for after-work drinks. 75 of 92 \nKATE BOSWORTH \nA super-girlie Swiss dotted sheer dress ( hers is just $58 from the Kohl's k/lab collection !) gets a little kick from some bold accessories, including her patent booties, chunky belt and Salvatore Ferragamo bucket bag . 76 of 92 Felipe Ramales / Splash News Online \nNAOMIE HARRIS \nA way to winterize your favorite summer pieces that isn't simply \"add black tights?\" Try jewel-tone embellished flats and a luxe coat like her Burberry cashmere trench . 77 of 92 Olivier Douliery/ABACA/AP \nMICHELLE OBAMA \nYou don't always have to default to green or sequins for your holiday party attire! Rich, deep cobalt and pretty brocade prints look just as festive (and silver shoes add a party feel to any outfit). Plus, when all else fails: put a bow on it. 78 of 92 \nALESSANDRA AMBROSIO \nOne easy way to spice up your favorite jeans-and-sweater airport ensemble: watch our handy GIFs to teach you how to tie a scarf in a new, fun way. 79 of 92 Photographer Group / Splash News Online \nJESSICA ALBA \nA long-sleeved print mini is adorable with flats in warmer months, and can be just as flirty in cooler months -- the added coverage of the tights means you can get a little fiercer with the footwear without looking too over-the-top. 80 of 92 Bryan Kasm/HSN \nMELISSA MCCARTHY \nA jewel tone top with an embellished collar ( hers is from her own line, Melissa McCarthy Seven7 ), plus black pants and classic black heels, is the perfect work holiday party outfit that will still be cute long into 2017. 81 of 92 Todd Williamson/Getty \nEMMA STONE \nDoes a print suit sound daunting? Just check out how easy it looks on Emma (hers is Burberry) with a black tank, ankle tie Stella Luna heels and super-minimal jewelry. 82 of 92 Splash News Online \nPIPPA MIDDLETON \nContrast the patrician vibe of a brushed-wool dove gray coat with classic hardware with some slightly edgy buckled boots. 83 of 92 FameFlynet \nKATE BECKINSALE \nIf you can solve the problem of how to walk without shrugging your scarf off, a large-check number worn as a poncho looks extra-classy over an all-black outfit, cat-eye sunglasses and heels. 84 of 92 starzfly/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images \nLILY COLLINS \nGot a lot of holiday travel planned? Eliminate one source of stress with this plane-perfect outfit (from her Parker Smith skinnies to her easy-to-slip-off-at-security booties). 85 of 92 Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock \nEMMY ROSSUM \nBrown stretch suede pants are a little advanced, but the good news is, this outfit (including the aforementioned pants, blazer , sweater , boots and clutch, with Lace by Jenny Wu earrings ) would look equally adorable with your favorite dark skinny jeans. 86 of 92 AKM-GSI \nREESE WITHERSPOON \nThis is the Platonic ideal of a Thanksgiving outfit: a classic Fair Isle sweater (hers is Draper James , of course), some jeans with a little give and a festive accessory like a red shoe or bag. It can vibe dressy or casual - so it's perfect for the first Thanksgiving at the potential future in-laws'. (Bonus points for a cute coordinate phone case, like her Minnie & Emma one !) 87 of 92 AKM-GSI \nMICHELLE MONAGHAN \nA soft, semi-structured sweater coat like Michelle's Madewell topper will double as a blanket when that turkey-induced couch coma kicks in (and the rest of the outfit, including her Madewell jeans , is comfy but still cool). 88 of 92 Michael Simon/startraks \nOLIVIA CULPO \nWhat's both fashion forward and mashed potatoes-friendly? An oversize sweater and over-the-knee boots ( hers are Rampage ). 89 of 92 Bauer-Griffin \nHILARY DUFF \nA cozy crewneck looks modern and unexpected when tucked into a maxi skirt (note the stretch) and paired with statement earrings like her The2Bandits pair . She wore hers with Ancient Greek sandals , but in colder climates, this would be cute with suede booties as well. 90 of 92 Michael Rozman / Warner Bros. \nEMMA STONE \nIf your Thanksgiving dinner is a little dressier, go for a jumpsuit - it's basically fancy pajamas, but no one will know. (Emma wore her Michael Kors Collection top and Michael Michael Kors pants with Jennifer Meyer jewelry and Jimmy Choo heels .) 91 of 92 AKM-GSI \nEMMA ROBERTS \nDon't want to talk about the election, your dating life or why you're taking seconds? The dinosaur on your sweatshirt will be an awesome conversation piece! (Emma let hers take center stage by pairing it with Citizens of Humanity jeans , sneakers and Garrett Leight x Clare V sunglasses.) 92 of 92 NIGNY / Splash News Online \nBELLA HADID \nWhen all else fails, including the button on your jeans, just wear all black and throw on a bold coat (hers is House of Harlow 1960 x Revolve ) and fabulous shoe ( hers are Stuart Weitzman ). It's a foolproof trick that's served stylish women since the beginning of time.
