But, if there’s anyone who’s going to do it, it’s the rag-tag group of Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Baby Groot — better known as the Guardians of the Galaxy .\nWe’ve certainly been treated to a handful of REALLY GREAT trailers for the upcoming movie so far, so it’s easy to be completely stoked for Vol. 2. If you can find it in yourself to be even more excited about it, here goes: The latest teaser features so much more action, and jokes, and Baby Groot , and it’s all under 30-seconds long.\nMarvel Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly, Guardians keeps getting better and better. Also, Baby Groot keeps getting cuter and cuter. OMG, will we even be able to contain ourselves till the movie drops?\nThis new trailer sets up the same story we’ve been told all along: The Guardians are back, and they are just as dysfunctional as ever before. And now joining them is Nebula, Gamora’s half-sister. (Spoiler alert: They do not get along.) She snarls that it’s certainly silly to be a “Garden of the Galaxy,” and Nebula can’t help but correct her.\nIt’s Guardian, not Garden. What even IS a Garden of the Galaxy? \nBut, TBH, if Baby Groot wants to be a Garden of the Galaxy, we’ll let him be it. We’ll let him be, and do, anything he wants. Baby Groot, we are here for you.\nMarvel The wait is almost over. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 opens on May 5th.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:59:12.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
