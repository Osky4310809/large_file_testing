Vine Camera will allow you to save your six-second videos to your camera roll or post them directly to Twitter, where they will still loop. \nIf you have updated to Vine Camera or have deleted Vine, you will not be able to download old videos from your phone, though your Vines will continue to exist on the company’s website for an unspecified amount of time. But if you still have the OG Vine app on your phone, today’s the last day you can use it to download your old videos, sources familiar with Twitter’s plans tell BuzzFeed News. \nTwitter bought Vine in 2012; when Twitter announced Vine’s demise, the app’s founder seemed to regret his choice. \nDon’t sell your company! — Rus (@rus) ID: 10340468 \nTwitter announced Vine’s shutdown in October.

The other option, a download link, will allow you to save the social data — Favorites and Revines — associated with the video. On the website, you can click “Download your Vines” in the top right hand corner of the page; the site will give you the same options as the app. , Vine \nOn the day of its demise, popular Vine creators paid tribute to the platform that made them famous: \ntoday is officially @vine last day of existence. better watch this with the volume up three hundred more times — Casey Neistat (@CaseyNeistat) \nVine you shall be missed.
