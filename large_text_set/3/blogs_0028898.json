The ESPN FC panel share their thoughts on the rumours that Chelsea are looking to sign Alexis Sanchez this summer. The FC crew question whether anyone can overtake N'Golo Kante in the running for PFA Player of the Year. \nEden Hazard's rejuvenated season for Premier League leaders Chelsea has led to renewed speculation linking him with a move away from Stamford Bridge. \nReal Madrid are the club currently linked most strongly with a potential bid for the attacker, with reports this week claiming his desire to work under coach Zinedine Zidane is a major motivating factor. \nBut the implications of a move going through or not go far beyond just the player's own career -- there would be significant ramifications for Chelsea if they were not able to hang on to one of their star players, or for Madrid if they lost out on yet another stellar transfer target. \nESPN FC's Chelsea and Madrid correspondents take a look at what success and failure in the tussle for Hazard would mean for each club. \nCHELSEA \nRoman Abramovich has never sold a player that Chelsea didn't want to lose. That reality is what Real Madrid will be battling against as they reportedly try to prise Eden Hazard from Stamford Bridge this summer. \nThe Russian billionaire has won every major trophy during 14 years of ownership. His backing has enabled Chelsea to become one of the most consistently successful clubs in the world, but the goal of establishing the Blues as the envy of the rest of football's elite remains to be fulfilled. \nHazard is crucial to that vision. Not since 2005, when Frank Lampard finished a distant second to Ronaldinho, have Chelsea possessed an individual talent worthy of serious Ballon d'Or consideration. The Belgium captain is not there yet, but the mere fact that Madrid are so interested will reinforce the confidence at Stamford Bridge in just how good he can become. \nAntonio Conte has restored Chelsea's supremacy in the Premier League, and looks as qualified as any coach in the Abramovich era to build a dynasty in West London. Success in the Champions League will be his next target and, if the Blues are serious about emulating their miraculous 2012 triumph, they have to regard clubs like Madrid as direct rivals. \nA player of Hazard's ability and potential would be almost impossible to replace, regardless of price tag, but his value extends beyond his direct contribution to the team. Having such a superstar instantly makes Chelsea more attractive suitors for Alexis Sanchez, Tiemoue Bakayoko or any other player they might target this summer. \nConversely, selling Hazard -- even for a world-record fee -- would reinforce the idea that Madrid and Barcelona remain the ultimate destinations for the world's very best players, making it harder for Chelsea to acquire truly elite talents in years to come. Abramovich wants to challenge and eventually surpass the reigning European champions, not help solve their problems. -- Liam Twomey Eden Hazard has recaptured the form that saw him scoop the top individual prizes in England for the 2014-15 season . \nREAL MADRID \nIt has been too long since Real Madrid made a big signature ' galactico ' signing -- making it extra important they succeed in their chase of Chelsea attacker Eden Hazard this summer. \nLast summer the only big-name arrival at the Bernabeu was Alvaro Morata, who returned to the Bernabeu from Juventus for €30 million.The previous year the biggest outlay was €31.5m on Brazilian reserve right-back Danilo. The last time Madrid really spent big was to splash out €75m on James Rodriguez after the 2014 World Cup, and that investment has really not paid off. \nMeanwhile, other clubs have been making their statement buys. Manchester United's £89.3m purchase of Paul Pogba -- also a target for Los Blancos -- saw the Premier League side take the world transfer record Madrid had held for 16 years through five different star signings. Add in legal fees and other costs and Barcelona could eventually have spent even more to secure Neymar. \nAt least as important in all this as the cash involved is the prestige factor, especially as Florentino Perez's claim on the club presidency is based on how he took over a financially troubled institution and turned it into the world's biggest and richest club. \nThe construction magnate is almost sure to get another term without even needing an election this summer, in part due to controversial changes to the club's statutes, but he still must show he can pull off the very biggest deals. \nThe recent slow-but-sure increase in speculation linking Madrid with Hazard looks very like the early days of their successful chases of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. But there was similar buzz 12 months ago suggesting Pogba would be arriving at the Bernabeu. And Neymar is still seen as another who got away despite legitimate interest. \nThe real question is not so much whether Madrid can afford to pay upwards of €100m to secure Hazard -- it is whether Perez can afford to let the idea grow that his club can no longer sign whoever they want. -- Dermot Corrigan \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.
