Thank God, the effort, not just mine, but from all the physiotherapists in Manchester, doctors and everyone. It was not easy for me.

Not muscle injury, but it’s the first time something happens that leaves me out of games. So it was not easy. But I saw that, of course, no one wants this to happen, but it could be worse. So we operated soon, I decided to operate and give it time.” \nAn expected recovery time would be between two and three months, meaning that Jesus could return in time for the final weeks of the season - and a possible appearance in the FA Cup Final, should City win their semi-final against Arsenal next month. \nHe added: \"I don’t know, I have no return prediction. But I hope I can still play some games this season.” poll loading Will Gabriel Jesus replace Sergio Aguero as the main man at City next season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T13:58:08.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
