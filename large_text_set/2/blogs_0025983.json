For starters, Nokia made an official comeback with a slurry of Android smartphone launches all in the affordable segment, the most loaded of which is the Nokia 6 smartphone ( first impressions ). Moto is back with a refreshed lineup of its popular G series of smartphones too, namely the G5 and the G5 Plus ( first impressions ). While all these smartphones bring a lot of exciting new features to the table, they’ll still have to compete against other popular bargain buys such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 ( review ). So if you happened to be in the market for an affordable smartphone and are torn between these three devices, we are here to make your decision-making process a little bit easier with our comparison of the Nokia 6, Moto G5 Plus and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. Design and Display \nThe refreshed Moto G5 Plus comes in a completely new avatar and replaces the plastic shell of its predecessor with a unibody metal design. The Nokia 6 can also be seen wearing a metal jacket and uses precision-milled aluminium for its construction. Similarly, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 can be seen encased in a metal shell too. The in-hand feel of all the three smartphones should be great with all the three offering good protection against accidental falls or drops. All three phones come with fingerprint sensors for added security. For display, all the three smartphones come equipped with 1080p panels. Users will get the most compact form factor with the Moto G5 Plus as it comes with a 5.2-inch display. Both the Nokia 6 and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 come with bigger 5.5-inch displays which makes them better devices for media consumption or playing games as they offer more screen real-estate. Performance, Storage and Software \nOn the performance side of things, users get a Snapdragon 430 processor aided with 3GB of RAM with the Nokia 6. Bear in mind that the Nokia 6 also comes in a 4GB RAM variant. However, both the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and the Moto G5 Plus come with a much better Snapdragon 625 processor which works in tandem with either 2GB, 3GB or 4GB of RAM on the Redmi Note 4 or 4GB of RAM on the Moto G5 Plus. Suffice it to say, the faster processor on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and the Moto G5 Plus should make both the devices better gaming companions than the Nokia 6, in theory at least. However, specs don’t tell the complete story, so we’d want to get our hands on the Nokia 6 and put it through a proper review before we comment on its performance. For storage, all the three smartphones ship with either 32GB or 64GB of onboard storage which can be expanded up to 128GB on the Redmi Note 4 and the Nokia 6, and up to 256GB on the Moto G5 Plus through a microSD card. The software is one of the biggest selling points of the Nokia 6 as the smartphone ships with Android Nougat in its purest form without any added UI customisations or tweaks. The Moto G5 Plus also offers users a near-stock Android Nougat experience and ships with Google’s Pixel launcher pre-installed. The UI on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is quite different, as it runs MIUI on top of Android Marshmallow. Camera, Battery and Connectivity \nFor cameras, the Moto G5 Plus comes furnished with a pair of 12MP and 5MP camera sensors on the back and the front respectively. On the contrary, Nokia’s contender bumps the pixel count on both the primary camera and the selfie shooter and ships with a 16MP main camera and an 8MP secondary camera. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 features a 13MP primary sensor and a 5MP secondary sensor. So in terms of just megapixel count, the Nokia 6 seems to be taking the lead as far as shooting prowess is concerned. However, the Moto G5 Plus also promises to be a strong contender for shooting, thanks to the dual-pixel tech it employs in its 12MP primary camera.The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 sources its fuel from a 4,100mAh battery which is the biggest of the lot. The Nokia 6 and the Moto G5 on the other hand each come with a 3,000mAh battery. All the three smartphones come with standard connectivity options along with support for 4G LTE. \nAndroid purists should definitely go with either the Nokia 6 or the Moto G5 Plus as they offer near-stock versions of Android Nougat and will be updated more frequently than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. That said, we’ve reviewed the Redmi Note 4 and think it’s a pretty solid buy, especially if you factor in the asking price. Both the Nokia 6 and the Moto G5 Plus are yet to land in the country, and as soon as they do, we’ll be reviewing them both to see how to they stack up – against each other as well as against the existing competitors.
