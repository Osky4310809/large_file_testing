And while the picture was initially unveiled back in January, today we’ve been blessed with new footage from the project’s LA premiere.\nThe clip in turn highlights Tyler, the Creator signing posters with his pal Frank Ocean, followed by a Q&A segment after the documentary screening. While Tyler clearly isn’t the biggest fan of signing autographs, writing “Fuck you dawg I just signed this poster so you can feel special but to be honest fuck you” on one of the posters, he did however provide some serious insight when questioned about the film .\nTo see this new clip from Tyler, the Creator’s Cherry Bomb: The Documentary premiere, press play above.\nUnfortunately, the Cherry Bomb movie bundle is currently sold out.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:20:01.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
