Down two points with 11 seconds left after Isaiah Thomas hit the second of two free throws, the Suns came down thinking they would have one shot to tie or go ahead.\nTYLER ULIS. WHAT A FINISH.\n\n(via @Hpbasketball ) pic.twitter.com/vEUhivLIb3 \n— SB Nation NBA (@SBNationNBA) March 6, 2017 Eric Bledsoe did just that, faking his defender out and finishing a layup on the opposite side of the rim. Tie game! The broadcast was so sure nothing else would happen that they briefly cut to Bledsoe running down the court.\nBy the time they had cut back, Thomas had somehow lost the ball and fumbled it straight to Tyler Ulis. With time running out, Ulis fired up a three that went in as the buzzer expired.\nThe Suns went from down two with about five seconds left to up three at the buzzer. That basically never happens in the NBA.\nHere’s what it looked like in the play-by-play.\nUlis finished with 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting. For now, he’ll just keep smashing the idea that he’s “too short.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:13:15.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
