Cockatoo cleared of KO tackle 0:17 \n“I think seven incidents in 10 years, they did lose a lot of patience and understandably have indicated that we’ve agreed that the relationship won’t continue in this current form or previous form into the future,” Cook said. \n“The last incident (was) in January 2015 with Dawson Simpson and we promised at that stage that if there was a major incident after that then we would pull out — and pretty much that is what has happened. \nCook said by the TAC’s standards, the Selwood speeding situation counted as a major incident. \n“He was certainly speeding,” Cook said. \n“In their own policies within the TAC if there was any executive who did the same thing, there’s an automatic redundancy made or dismissal. \n“So they’re treating Joel as an executive, so to speak, within their own rules and regulations. I think they’re being reasonable. \n“It’s just difficult to manage a contract like this. We’ve done our best and in the end it hasn’t worked.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
