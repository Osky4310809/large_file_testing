The season schedule, test dates and much more... \n\"Before being capable of innovating I think it's important that we completely catch up to Mercedes, which we hope to be able to achieve at the start of 2018.\" \nRed Bull's two victories in 2016 were proof that a strong chassis can bring results and Abiteboul accepted that Renault's goal wasn't to match Mercedes' power this season, when aerodynamics will be more important than ever thanks to a technical regulation overhaul. \nThe Formula 1 Gossip Column \nSpeaking in more detail about Renault's failure to compete over the last three years, in which Red Bull threatened to find a new engine partner, he also claims the team became \"complacent\" thanks to their success at the start of the decade. \n\"Clearly we have disappointed with the new generation of engine with the new power unit,\" Abiteboul explained. \"It's not in the Renault DNA to disappoint either the fan or the customer team. Obviously Red Bull were very vocal about it. \n\"In 2015 it was about resetting, restarting from a clean sheet of paper. We changed a lot of the management structure and the processes in the French engine workshop. \n\"I think we were a bit complacent in what we were doing, based on the success we had with Red Bull with the V8, not looking at the big new regulation change and power unit.\" \nMost important to the manufacturer is ensuring the Renault team become successful again, with the Enstone-based outfit struggling to ninth place in the Constructors' Championship on their return to the sport in 2016. Sky Sports F1 will show every Formula 1 Grand Prix, qualifying and practice session live in 2017. \n\"We have put together a clear, long-term road map of the innovation we want to bring to F1 and more specifically the power unit,\" Abiteboul stressed. \"They will support us in this quest for a championship by 2020.\" \nRenault's management structure, meanwhile, has changed ahead of the new campaign with Fred Vassuer leaving his role as team boss by mutual consent. \nFrench publication L'Equipe claimed Vassuer's departure was a 'huge blow' to Renault but Abiteboul added: \"It's a steady ship.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T15:57:12.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
