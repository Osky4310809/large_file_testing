The high-tech lifting device — which, no , isn't a vibrator (although it certainly resembles one) — was, before today, perhaps the brand's coolest launch to date. Well, that's all about change because Clarisonic is flipping the sonic cleansing script. Instead of removing your mascara smears and smudges with one of its iconic sonic cleansing brushes, you'll soon be able to use it to apply your makeup. Say hello to the Clarisonic Sonic Foundation Brush. This April, Clarisonic will launch its first-ever makeup application device, aptly named the Sonic Foundation Brush, and believe us when we say, it may just change your entire makeup game — for the better. So, what is it? While technically not a brush, but a brush head that fits into any Clarisonic device (i.e., the Mia 1, Mia 2, Mia FIT and the Smart Profile), the Sonic Foundation Brush is made with supersoft, antimicrobial brush head fibers that promises to seamlessly blend in your foundation, blush, bronzer, and concealer with more than \"18,000 micro-blends per minute,\" which were guessing is a lot.
