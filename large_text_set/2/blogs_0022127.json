Barack Obama’s LinkedIn page says he’s still POTUS , reported Mashable, and it’s bringing up all sorts of feelings. By seeing his picture and “President of the United States of America” under his name, our hearts just cried.\nOf course, the former president has been ~busy~, from he and Michelle going on vacation to Obama taking Malia to a Broadway show . Yup, the latter just happened yesterday. The two went to see Arthur Miller’s The Price . Awwww. So, one possible reason that Obama hasn’t changed his LinkedIn profile is because he’s been swamped with everyday non-POTUS-related life. Riiiight?!\nBarack Obama/LinkedIn Or maybe, just maybe, he still wants to be president?! \nAnd, of course, you can keep scrolling down Obama’s LinkedIn page for more… Barack Obama/LinkedIn \n…but, personally, we had to stop — our hearts couldn’t handle it. This just begs the question: What about Obama’s Twitter account ? What does his profile say?!\nBarack Obama/Twitter Yup, still “President” — in present tense. However, once you scroll down his Twitter page a bit, he talks about being POTUS in the past tense. \nI read letters like these every single day. It was one of the best parts of the job – hearing from you. https://t.co/so1luBcszV \n— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 22, 2017 Confusing, right?! I guess the wishful thinkers in all of us hope Obama will be POTUS again. Meanwhile, we’ll see if he changes his social media statuses. In any case, #wemissyouobama.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:42:36.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
