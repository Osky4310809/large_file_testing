As an adult, you might be influenced to impulsively buy one of those things, but you're an adult. It's your decision. \nParents out there, however, have to try and explain to their kids why \"The World's Tallest Alien Woman is Marrying Her Dog\" or that no, they can't have all the candy. That's why Jane Kramer wants the grocery chain Meijer to remove all junk food, tabloids, and magazines from their checkout lines — to avoid temptation. via: CBC News \nThe checkouts weren’t a problem for her before adopting a five-year-old child, but now her son makes her look at the checkout through a different lens. She believes the magazines promote unattainable standards of beauty and body image and the tabloids make fun of peoples' weight and appearance. via: CBC News \n“What was an issue, was the reading materials, because after he learned to read the first thing he asked me about was an article about cocaine,” said Kramer. “I think he was about six or seven.” Throw easy access to junk food into the mix and she said the checkout can have customers paying in more way than one. via: CBC News \n“It’s damaging to everybody, so it’s not just kids. It’s everybody’s mental and physical health,” Kramer said. That’s why Jane started an initiative on Change.org in September of 2016 that targets Meijer grocery stores throughout Michigan — as well as Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Kentucky. \nShe suggests bags of carrots or a banana be available for purchase instead of candy and chocolate bars at checkouts. \nWhere magazines and tabloids now fill the shelves, Kramer said she’d like to see children’s books or educational magazines. 22 Words Rocks ...AND GETS ALL UP IN YOUR FACEBOOK More posts in #Food & Drink", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T05:58:28.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
