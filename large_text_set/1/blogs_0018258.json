It is a selfie-centric phone with two front cameras. The phone features 20MP and 8MP shooters and a front-facing LED flash. The dual cameras allow you to achieve a realistic bokeh effect with your face in focus and a blurred background. The device also flaunts a metal unibody design with a fingerprint sensor that’s embedded into its home button. \nAs far as the other specs are concerned, the vivo V5 Plus features a 5.5-inch full HD display with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The phone is powered by a 2.0GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, mated to a beefy 4GB of RAM. The storage capacity on board is 64GB, which can’t be expanded further as the device lacks a microSD card slot. \nAt the rear, the vivo V5 Plus sports a 16-megapixel primary shooter with an LED flash and 4K video recording support. Software-wise, the handset boots Funtouch OS 3.0, which is based on Android Marshmallow. In terms of connectivity, it offers 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS. A 3,055mAh battery with fast charging support keeps the package running. \nThe vivo V5 Plus has been priced at Rs 27,980. The phone will be available to pre-order starting tomorrow in the major brick-and-mortar stores across the country. It will go on open sale starting from February 1st.
