It's a small world after all for Jennifer Lopez and her ex-boyfriend, Beau Casper Smart. The \"On the Floor\" singer was having a fun girls night out with her bestie, actress Leah Remini, at El Floridita nightclub in Los Angeles on Monday, when the pair ran into Lopez's former flame. Photo: Splash News PHOTOS: Jennifer Lopez Speaks Out Following Split From Casper Smart: 'Protect Your Heart' The seemingly cordial encounter occurred outside the club, where Smart was also hanging out. The 29-year-old actor and dancer was seen holding a bouquet of flowers when he happened across Lopez and Remini. It's unclear if Lopez, Remini and Smart were all attending the same event at the nightclub or if the run-in was simply a coincidence. WATCH: Jennifer Lopez Spends Time With Son Max While Ex Casper Smart Gets Inspirational New Tattoo One person who was definitely not hanging with Lopez at El Floridita was her rumored beau, Drake , who was in London, England, performing to a massive crowd at the O2 Arena, and hanging out with his old friend , Nicki Minaj. Lopez later shared an video from inside the nightclub, which seemed to be one giant dance party. The short clip pans around her group of friends, including Remini, but Smart is nowhere to be seen.
