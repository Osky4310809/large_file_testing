The House of Commons has already voted overwhelmingly for a Labour Opposition Motion that called for the Government to publish a Brexit plan, and the Prime Minister should be in no doubt that we do not consider a 45-minute speech to be any substitute. \nThis Parliamentary battle really matters and, if we can win support for these amendments, Labour can help shape the process and significantly strengthen Parliamentary accountability and scrutiny. \nBut we must also remember that triggering Article 50 is just the start, not the end of the process. \nOnce Article 50 is triggered there will multiple opportunities to campaign and argue for the Government to take the right approach to Brexit. Any proposed changes to domestic law must involve votes in Parliament, whether through the Great Repeal Bill or other legislation. \nFor Labour, that means the chance and responsibility to fight for a Brexit deal that puts jobs and the economy first and insists there can be no drop in workers' rights or environmental protections. It also means vigorously opposing the Prime Minister's threat to rip-up existing economic and social protections, including slashing corporate taxes and public spending. \nThis is, as I have said before, the battle of our times. \nSo while today was an important day in the Brexit process, there will be many more to come. \nKeir Starmer QC MP is the Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and Labour MP for Holborn & St Pancras Follow Keir Starmer on Twitter: www.twitter.com/@cpsuk More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T02:32:11.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
