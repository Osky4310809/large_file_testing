Outerwear options, like trenches, mountaineering jackets and tweed coats all give off a distinct Sacai uniqueness about them, while other designs like salt-and-pepper emblazoned offerings take a slight departure from past motifs for a refreshing injection of newness.\nMost importantly, the new collection displays Chitose Abe’s capabilities in the form of infusion and flow, as opposed to her established position as an expert producer of contrast pieces.\nCheck out the range in the gallery above, and let us know any specific pieces caught your eye.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:57:54.079+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
