Well, you will not miss him, new Punjab minister says won’t quit Kapil Sharma show Love watching Navjot Singh Sidhu on TV? Well, you will not miss him, new Punjab minister says won’t quit Kapil Sharma show Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday said that he will continue doing TV. By: FE Online | Published: March 17, 2017 5:20 PM Interacting with media, the new Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said, in his trademark acerbic style, “If people do not have a problem, why do you worry?” (ANI) \nThe factors that make Kapil Sharma’s comedy show such a hot commodity on TV is not just the humor of Kapil Sharma or Dr Mashoor Gulati but also the laughter of Navjot Singh Sidhu and his cracking one-liners. From ‘Comedy Night with Kapil’ to ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’, Sidhu has constantly been a part of the comedy team. While Kappu (Kapil Sharma) leaves no chance to humorously flirt with women celebs who come to the show, Sidhu woos them, and much of the wider audience, with his shayari and his signature reciting style. However, now when the cricketer turned politician has been elected an MLA in Punjab during the recent elections there and been appointed a minister in the Congress government with the responsibility of Local Bodies Ministry, it created much uncertainty in his fans about whether the man would have to give up his presence in the show and the audience will henceforth be deprived of his famously cutting wit. Well, all the anxieties can now be laid to rest as yes, Sidhu will stay on the show. The Congress leader on Friday said that he will continue doing TV. Interacting with media, the new Punjab minister said, in his trademark acerbic style, “If people do not have a problem, why do you worry?” Sidhu further assured that his working with TV will not affect his political role, as he said, “If I do TV I will leave at 3 from here and will return here before anyone wakes up.” \nSidhu has been a permanent part of the comedy team since it was started. However, during the Punjab poll campaigning, he missed a few episodes but the team remained marked his presence with keeping a life-size cardboard cutout of him placed on his chair. Sidhu has also appeared as guest with his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu on one episode of ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’. \nSidhu, a former Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) man, had resigned in September last year. Months after the resignation, he joined Congress party, after also flirting with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), ahead of the Punjab assembly polls and started campaigning. After the party rode to a huge victory in the state, winning 77 seats out of 117 seats under Capt Amarinder Singh, there were expectations that Sidhu will become the deputy chief minister of the state. However, instead, he has been given the low-profile Local Bodies Ministry. \nYou may also like to watch: Either Navjot Singh Sidhu will have to resign as a minister or quit the show: KTS Tulsi #SidhuKaJoke pic.twitter.com/w8kelEdugw \n— TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) March 17, 2017 \nEarlier on the day, senior advocate KTS Tulsi said that Sidhu has to either he will has to resign as minister if he wants to continue the show or he will has to discontinue the show.
