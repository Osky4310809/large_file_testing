But at least we get to see Maisie Williams in a totally new character in an upcoming Netflix original film, iBoy . \nAnd now we can see Maisie shine in the newly released trailer for the movie. From the intensity and action in the trailer alone, we can already tell this movie will make our hearts pound. It looks like we’ll get to see the actress in a totally new light. She’ll show some serious dramatic acting chops in this futuristic world. And we are totally feeling it.\nOf course, we know Maisie can do awesome action sequences thanks to the agility of her character on GoT .\n\nAnd her costar in the movie, Bill Milner, is certainly no stranger to action films. He played a young Magneto in X-Men: First Class . And that means he’s also used to having superhuman abilities, which he acquires in this story.\nThese two look like they have awesome chemistry as best friends in the trailer. \nWe can’t wait to see the revenge Milner gets with his newfound abilities after a group of thugs mess with his friend, Maisie. Luckily, we won’t have to wait long to see this awesome movie since it becomes available for global streaming on January 27.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T20:39:58.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
