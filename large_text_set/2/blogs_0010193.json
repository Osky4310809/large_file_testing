Her attempt to read Coretta Scott King’s letter in opposition to Jeff Sessions appointment as a federal judge 1986 ended up becoming more powerful because she didn’t get to finish. The GOP attempts to keep her quiet had the opposite effect, likely causing a few issues for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell .\n\nSo it’s fitting that SNL would spoof the incident a bit during “Weekend Update,” using it to not only discuss what happened by also to poke a little fun at itself. Sen. Warren persisted on the floor of the Senate and she attempted to do the same while rooting out corruption on SNL . While poking with questions about free swag Michael Che and Colin Jost get and their salaries compared to other cast members who work the entire show, Kate McKinnon makes Elizabeth Warren seem like a bit of a buzzkill. In a good way, though, save for the whole snitching on her fellow classmates in school. \nAt this point, McKinnon will be playing every member of Congress and a few more White House positions by season 45 . On this episode alone, she pulled out Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Sessions, and that very crazy version of Kellyanne Conway . She can’t be stopped and could even play Steve Bannon before it’s all said and done. \n(Via SNL )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T15:53:36.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
