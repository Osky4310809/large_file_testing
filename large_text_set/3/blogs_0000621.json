A 3km Protection Zone and a 10km Surveillance Zone are already in place following the previous case in the area. Our investigations will continue and the restrictions already placed on the site will remain in force until cleansing and disinfection is finished and the investigation is complete. \nPublic Health England advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency is clear that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. \nRead the latest advice and information on avian flu in the UK , including actions to reduce the risk of the disease spreading, advice for anyone who keeps poultry or captive birds and details of previous cases. You can use our interactive map to check if you are affected by restrictions around any premises. Journalists with queries should contact Defra press office on 02082257318.
