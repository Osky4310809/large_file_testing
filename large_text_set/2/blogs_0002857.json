George Gregan has paid tribute to Joost van der Westhuizen, declaring that the World Cup-winner changed the way halfbacks played the game and will go down as one of rugby’s all-time greats. \nVan der Westhuizen, 45, lost his long battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neuron disease, on Monday. \nHis death has been mourned across the rugby world. \nOne of the finest players to set foot on a rugby field, van der Westhuizen was capped 89 times for the Springboks and captained South Africa on 10 occasions. \nHe played an instrumental role in the Springboks winning the 1995 World Cup and will forever be remembered for his try-saving tackle on a runaway Jonah Lomu. \n“He’s one of the great Springbok players,” Gregan told foxsports.com.au. \n“No one will ever forget what he did, along with Francois Pienaar and all his teammates, in 1995 when South Africa hosted the first World Cup after Apartheid and won. \n“He was such an influential player in that World Cup and for the Springboks for many, many years.” media_camera Former Wallabies captain George Gregan says rugby has lost of their all-time greats after the passing of Joost van der Westhuizen. \nGregan, Australia’s most capped player (139), first squared off against van der Westhuizen in 1993. \nAnd from early on, Gregan, two-years van der Westhuizen’s junior, saw something special in his opposite number immediately. \nOn that day, van der Westhuizen, 22 and on his first Springbok tour, scored twice as the Springboks romped home 57-10 against the Canberra Kookaburras, scoring 40 points in the final 30 minutes to run-out big winners in a spiteful encounter between the two sides. \nBut few spectators watching the match at Bruce Stadium would have imagined the careers that the two halfbacks would go onto have. \n“I played him first when he toured in 1993 with the Springbok team,” Gregan said. \n“He was a young man then. \n“He was always destined to reach great heights. \n“He was a wonderful player and I was playing for the Kookaburras when I first played against him in Canberra and you just knew he was a special player then.” media_camera Joost van der Westhuizen tackles his counterpart George Gregan during the opening match of 1995 World Cup at Newlands Stadium. \nLess than two years later the duo would come up against each other in the opening match of the World Cup at Newlands in Cape Town. \nOnce again it was the Springboks that dominated the match and their first-up win against the Wallabies proved to be the spring board for the rest of the tournament. \nVan der Westhuizen would go onto scored 38 tries for the Springboks. \nNo other halfback has scored more than 20 tries in Test rugby and he remains South Africa’s second highest tryscorer behind winger Bryan Habana (67). \nAnd it was that uncanny ability to find the tryline, his athleticism and competitiveness that has separated van der Westhuizen to other players, according to Gregan. \n“He was unique,” Gregan said. “He’s one of those unique players who probably changed the way a halfback, particularly a big halfback, played the game. He was about six foot two and was such an athletic player. \n“He could change games individually, he could kick with both feet and he’d back himself with his turn of speed. He had the speed of a winger. He was just a real threat. \n“You’d have team-meetings and you’d talk about the ‘Joost factor’. You don’t normally talk about a halfback in that regard. Halfbacks are decision makers. To use a basketball analogy, they’re probably more on their assists. They’ve got a bit of a running game, but he could cut loose like an outside back. \n“I loved playing against him. He was a real competitor. Mind you, I don’t think many people who play for South Africa aren’t competitors, but Joost was right up there.” Horan: He redefined the game 3:38 \nRugby: Tim Horan joins the team to chat about the loss of Joost Van Der Westhuizen. February 7th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Rugby Union/News/ Horan: He redefined the game \nWhile they held a deep respect for each other on the field, it wasn’t until after their playing careers that the duo got to know each other. \nGregan and All Blacks halfback Justin Marshall visited van der Westhuizen in 2011 to help him raise funds and bring awareness about his deadly disease. \nWith van der Westhuizen’s health declining, the duo returned two years ago to visit their friend. \nGregan said that rugby, after the death of Lomu and Jerry Collins and Norm Berryman in 2015, had lost one of their icons. \n“It really is sad,” Gregan said. “You obviously take stock of what you have and how lucky you are. \n“You talk about guys like Jonah and Joost, when rugby went into semi-professionalism around that (the 1995) World Cup, those two were international iconic players known all around the world for their deeds on the field and how they carried themselves consistently, in terms of their level of play. So it’s really sad to see those guys, in their early 40s, leaving us. \n“The rugby world has lost a couple of really special players. \n“I know last year was a big one for the All Blacks, losing three great All Blacks Jerry Collins, Norm Berryman and Jonah. \n“It’s been a time to reflect over the last 12-18 months for people of my age bracket because we were young men when we started our careers and to see them gone is really sad.” media_camera Joost van der Westhuizen brings down Jonah Lomu during the 1995 Rugby World Cup final at Ellis Park. \nFor Gregan, the moment the duo exchanged jerseys for the first time will forever be in his memory. \n“We played against each other heaps of times when he was playing for the Blue Bulls (in Super Rugby) and many Test matches, but there was a deep respect for each other,” he said. \n“We played against each other in 1997 at the old Lang Park in a Test match and we actually played really well and managed a win. \n“And he insisted that he wanted to swap jerseys because we hadn’t before and we had been playing against each other for about three years, and he said ‘It’s time we swapped jerseys’, so we swapped jerseys right there on the field and it was a nice moment. \n“I think that just underpins him. There were two very competitive players — but I think for all number No 9’s there’s always a deep respect — particularly if you play against each other for many, many years and that was in 1997 and we continued to play against each other up until 2003. \n“I was fortunate enough to play with one of the great scrumhalves I think rugby’s ever seen. \n“It was a privilege.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:39:55.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
