Trump does it better \nNobody can do it like me. Nobody is stronger than me. Nobody has better toys than I do. There’s nobody bigger or better at the military than I am. Nobody loves the Bible more than I do. Nobody builds walls better than me. \nNobody does anything better than Trump, got it? Please watch this video, if you can get through it. \nThere’s nobody that’s done so much for equality as I have. There’s nobody more pro-Israel than I am. There’s nobody more conservative than me. There’s nobody that respects women more than I do. Nobody’s ever had crowds like Trump’s had. \nThere have been a trove of articles in the last few weeks about how we shouldn’t diagnose Trump or claim he’s a narcissist. Mkay. I’ll just leave you with the definition of Narcissistic Personality Disorder : \n“The hallmarks of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) are grandiosity, a lack of empathy for other people, and a need for admiration. People with this condition are frequently described as arrogant, self-centered, manipulative, and demanding. They may also concentrate on grandiose fantasies (e.g. their own success, beauty, brilliance) and may be convinced that they deserve special treatment. These characteristics typically begin in early adulthood and must be consistently evident in multiple contexts, such as at work and in relationships. \n“People with narcissistic personality disorder believe they are superior or special, and often try to associate with other people they believe are unique or gifted in some way. This association enhances their self-esteem, which is typically quite fragile underneath the surface. Individuals with NPD seek excessive admiration and attention in order to know that others think highly of them. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder have difficulty tolerating criticism or defeat, and may be left feeling humiliated or empty when they experience an “injury” in the form of criticism or rejection.” \"One of the most effective press conferences I've ever seen!\" says Rush Limbaugh. Many agree.Yet FAKE MEDIA calls it differently! Dishonest \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 Just leaving Florida. Big crowds of enthusiastic supporters lining the road that the FAKE NEWS media refuses to mention. Very dishonest! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nWe’re not saying he’s a narcissist. But if he were he’d be the BIGGEST, BEST one around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:09:09.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
