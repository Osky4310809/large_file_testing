and a hard Brexit would therefore be 'the worst case scenario' for manufacturers, the study found Tuesday 21 March 2017 09:57 GMT Click to followThe Independent Online The auto industry is broadly considered one of the sectors most vulnerable to the implications of a hard Brexit PA \nThe cost of buying a new car in the UK could be about to soar. \nAccording to research published on Tuesday, Britain moving to a World Trade Organisation regime after Brexit would lead to the introduction of a 10 per cent tariff on finished vehicles and a 4.5 per cent tariff on component parts for cars. \nIf manufacturers pass that cost directly on to customers—and taking all the stages of production into account— the price tag for a new vehicle could soar by as much as £2,372 per car, according to PA Consulting, which conducted the study. Number of cars built in Britain hits 17-year high \nThe management consultancy group found that EU exports account for around 57.5 per cent of cars sold in the UK and that a hard Brexit would therefore be “the worst case scenario” for manufacturers. \n“Any change in tariffs and regulations will immediately impact the automotive supply chain and make sourcing of assembly parts and distribution of finished vehicles more costly, forcing organisations to rethink their medium to long-term strategies,” the group wrote. \n“Although the final position is still unknown, what is without question is that the automotive industry must assess the impact, generate options and be prepared,” it added. \nThe auto industry is broadly considered one of the sectors most vulnerable to the implications of a hard Brexit. Read more Nissan may 'adjust' its business in the UK despite earlier assurances \nIn January, Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders , said that a failure by the UK to clinch adequate trade deals with the EU after Brexit “ could damage UK automotive manufacturing beyond repair”. \nToyota earlier this month committed to investing £240m into modernising one of its plants in Derbyshire, but confidence among other major global manufacturers seems to have been bruised by Brexit. \nLate last month Nissan said it may “adjust” its business in the UK depending on the outcome of Brexit , potentially jeopardising 7,000 jobs at its Sunderland plant \nTuesday’s study by PA Consulting also shows that European based manufacturing companies would likely face additional costs for exporting to the UK from mainland Europe under a hard Brexit.

Getty Images 2/26 London to lose status as 'gateway to Europe' for banks \nOne of Germany’s top banking regulators has warned that London could lose its status as “gateway to Europe” for the banking sector after Britain quits the European trading bloc. Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports.

Sterling’s fall also made UK stocks more affordable for overseas investors.
