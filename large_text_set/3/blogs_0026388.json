We're always working on it,” said Haas who was joined at Austin Country Club by his father, Jay, a nine-time PGA Tour winner. “He was out west and on his way home I just asked him to stop in.” \nBill Haas – who defeated Phil Mickelson in the quarterfinals, 2 and 1, to advance to the final four – said he and his father worked on two different drills on Tuesday and Wednesday in an attempt to find more consistency off the tee. WGC-Dell Match Play: Articles, photos and videos \n“I'm still hitting foul balls to the right but that's kind of been my whole thing. I get underneath the ball. I'm just trying to cover the ball a little bit better,” Haas said. \nHaas is fifth this week in strokes gained: off the tee and hit 12 of 13 fairways in his match against Mickelson to advance to the semifinals. Prior to this week he’d only advanced past the third round once at the Match Play (2016). \n“I give [ Jay Haas ] all the credit in the world. He's the guy I bounce ideas off golf swing-wise all the time,” Haas said. “The only reason I play golf is because of him. He's a great guy to have in my corner.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T02:26:34.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
