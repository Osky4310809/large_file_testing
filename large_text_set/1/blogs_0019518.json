But for now, I’m using it for the primary purpose of raising daily budget, lowering budget, and stopping an ad set if it isn’t performing up to par. \nThe condition I’m using as the focus is CPC (link), but only for campaigns where the objective is traffic (promoting blog posts). The reason is simple. I expect much higher CPCs for ads where I’m promoting a product or opt-in. And a CPC doesn’t determine success or failure of those campaigns. \nBut it does when the goal is to drive traffic. So I am having Facebook increase my budget by 50% if the CPC is under $.10, lower it by 50% if it’s over $.20 and stop it if it’s over $.25. \nWe’ll see how this goes, but this could allow me to leverage strong performance by increasing budget sooner while cutting back waste when something just isn’t working. \nI will also create similar rules for conversions, but the conditions will be relative to what I’m promoting. I shouldn’t expect the same Cost Per Conversion for selling a membership, for example, as I would a free registration. Weaknesses of Automated Rules \nAnd that takes me to the issues I have with Automated Rules. They apply locally or globally with little in between. \nI created a rule for current campaigns that drive traffic. However, when I create a new campaign, I can’t apply that prior rule to this new campaign. I’ll need to create a new (duplicate) rule. \nThe “solution” would be that I could apply the rule globally so that it will apply to all new active campaigns as well. But as mentioned earlier, I don’t want that. \nWhat would be great is if I could apply a rule against all campaigns with the same objective, at least in the case of driving traffic. I would apply the same rules for all of those ads. \nBut as I was just saying, the conversion objective couldn’t be handled globally since not all conversions are equal — and not all expectations for cost per conversion would thereby be the same. \nSo in addition to wanting a “Campaign Objective” condition, it would be nice to add conditions like “Campaign name includes” or “Ad set name includes.” That way, I could make sure to include a certain word or phrase in the name, knowing it would trigger a certain rule. \nThese are the immediate issues I’m seeing, but I need more time with the feature. \n[UPDATE: A representative tells me that some or all of this actually is possible, but I am awaiting confirmation on specifics.] Your Turn \nOverall, there is enormous potential for Automated Rules.
