But the wait is finally over, guys! Yesterday, Meghan Markle returned to Instagram with an artsy post that included an inspiring message and a peek at her royally adorable shoes.\nWe’ve really missed Meghan on IG . Her page is filled with a swoonworthy assortment of travel pics, artistic food shots, inspirational quotes, super-gorgeous fashion photos, on-set shots from Suits and our personal faves, cute pictures of her rescue dogs. Even though her amazing lifestyle blog, The Tig , has remained active on all social media platforms, we’ve been waiting (and waiting) for a word from Meghan herself.\nWe get it, though. She’s being discreet, which is very much a thing when it comes to the royal family. Other than an official palace account , none of the royals have a social media presence. Oh how we wish they did! Can you even imagine???\n\nThe bottom line: Prince Harry won’t be posting any vacay pics from his INSANELY romantic jaunt to see the Northern Lights with Meghan last month. (Sniffle!) So we’re considering ourselves lucky that Meghan is back.\nEven better, her latest Insta is so perfectly Meghan Markle. It includes the hashtag #nobadenergy painted on a sidewalk, along with the caption, “Sending good vibes – always in all ways #bethechange.” We obviously love this positive message! And have we mentioned her shoes??? We did, right?\nBecause LOOK AT THEM.\nSending good vibes - always in all ways #nobadenergy #bethechange \nA photo posted by Meghan Markle (@meghanmarkle) on Feb 12, 2017 at 11:46am PST \nBe still our kitty-loving hearts.
