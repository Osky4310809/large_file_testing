By Cindy Kuzma Wednesday, March 1, 2017, 3:40 pm \nYoga can loosen tight muscles, improve focus, and build strength. But it’s normal to wonder just how well that translates into easier miles or faster race times, especially when you could spend that extra hour, you know, running. Here, five elites explain how yoga aids their training—and improves their lives. 1/5 Photograph courtesy of Melody Fairchild \nMelody Fairchild, 43, Boulder, Colorado “It’s a creative thing for me.” \nFairchild has been a stellar runner since high school. But in the past six years, she’s added a new dimension to her training with Kundalini yoga. \nCalled the yoga of awareness, Kundalini involves mantras in Sanskrit and hand positions called mudras, designed to channel energy through centers called meridians. \n“I’ve had really powerful experiences in class, so I really believe in it. I have fun bringing it to my running,” she says. Victor Sailer/PhotoRun \nOne place so applies them: her prerace warmups. Fairchild says they clear her mind of any lingering doubts or anxieties.“It scrambles up the routine,” she says. “I’ll be jogging and pressing my tongue to the roof of my mouth and simultaneously pressing my thumb into each one of my other four fingers hard on the tips, all while reciting a chant. If nothing else, I have to focus on that and I can’t think about anything else.” The mindfulness that comes from yoga allows her to continue evolving as a runner, she says. On February 4, she won the U.S. Masters Cross Country Championships in 24:02, even though having an 11-month-old son limited her training to about 25 miles a week.“I’m really enjoying playing with these different ideas,” she says, “and the journey continues.” \nRELATED: Flex, bend, and stretch your way to injury free running with the Runner's World Yoga DVD ! Ashley Higginson, 27, Morristown, New Jersey \n“You leave so happy and rebooted. It really changed my perspective.” \nFor three years during the buildup to the 2016 U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials, where she competed in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, Higginson balanced 70- to 80-mile weeks with law school. Now, she combines running at a high level for the New Jersey-New York Track Club with a more-than-full-time job as an attorney. You might wonder how she has a moment for a single downward-facing dog. But in fact, Higginson says, hour-long vinyasa classes play a crucial part in managing her stress and maintaining positivity in the face of life’s challenges.“For me, it’s that time to just take it all in stride—to realize A, you’re not that important; B, don’t take yourself too seriously; and C, appreciate all the opportunities you have,” she says. Photograph courtesy of Ashley Higginson \nIn high school, Higginson dabbled in Bikram, hitting classes with a teammate to increase her flexibility and ward off injury. When she developed a stress fracture during her collegiate career at Princeton University she truly found her place in the studio. Sidelined from most other workouts, she practiced yoga every day—and fell in love.“It was an amazing way to work on the mental game of me, as a human being,” she says. “But certainly I realized really quickly what that meant for my running.” For instance, midway through a seven-mile tempo run, she can refocus her energy on the moment rather than worrying about what’s to come. “I feel great right now, maybe at mile five I won’t,” she says. “But why am I already going to be negative about mile five at mile two? That little change in perspective made a really big difference for me in training—and outside of it.” Now, Higginson does quick stretches and sun salutations in the mornings and a longer class or home practice one or two evenings per week. She tries to do them the same day as her hard workouts, to give her body immediate recovery time and a more complete break on rest days. Stephanie Garcia, 28, Greenville, South Carolina \n“I’ve found it has really helped me be more aware of my body.” Balance is key in the steeplechase—and Garcia, who placed fifth in the 3,000-meter event at last summer’s Olympic Trials, says one-legged poses boost hers. Garcia first discovered yoga soon after moving to Greenville in 2014. She usually practices Ashtanga, a type that coordinates breath and movement. The asanas or poses increase her flexibility, build strength in her legs and core, and increase the connection between her body and mind—all of which translate back to her running.“I’ve had runs where I might be feeling totally crappy and I try and just tap back into my breath, which is a huge thing they talk about in yoga,” she says. “All of a sudden, the run flies by and I survived it, feeling a lot better than when I started.” Photograph courtesy of Stephanie Garcia \nShe enjoys hot yoga too, but finds it hard to balance with hard training. One of the first times she tried it, she had a long run the next day. She wondered why she felt tired and heavy, then realized the hourlong sweat session had depleted her. “That kind of trial and error taught me that there are great times to incorporate it into my week, but I have to just be smart about it,” she says. Now, Garcia works with her coach to identify where yoga fits in her schedule. In peak phases, she does an hourlong or 90-minute Ashtanga yoga class per week on the same day as a hard workout to allow for adequate recovery on her easy days. She then tapers down to a shorter home practice during racing season. Among her favorite poses: Headstands, legs up the wall, or any other inversions. “It's just good reversing the blood flow and giving yourself a different perspective,” she says. Nate Jenkins, 36, Andover, Massachusetts \n“After a couple of months of Bikram, my body started to open up and heal.” By day, he’s a math teacher. In the early mornings and after school, Jenkins is on the roads, logging about 100 miles per week as he builds toward a successful marathon comeback. On weekends, he often races and always makes time for Bikram. Jenkins ran a personal-best of 2:14:56 to finish seventh at the 2008 Olympic Marathon Trials. Since then, he’s worked to overcome a series of injuries, including a loss of coordination in his right leg that back surgery, physical therapy, and changes in his stride haven’t completely addressed. The Bikram classes he’s diligently attended since 2012 haven’t made the problem vanish either, but they’ve helped—so much so that he wonders if regular practice earlier in his career might have allowed him to avoid the issue entirely. He also notices that his ankles, hamstrings, and back feel better when he’s diligent about attending.“It’s not a miracle cure for everything, but it does go a long way toward improving most of the sort of daily things that can cause trouble,” he says. He prefers Bikram because he’s a creature of habit—and unlike other more varied methods, each Bikram class involves precisely the same series of 26 poses, in identical sequence, for exactly 90 minutes. It’s also done in 105-degree heat. Jenkins makes sure he stays hydrated to compensate, gulping at least two big glasses of water an hour beforehand. He almost always takes a class on Saturday or Sunday night because of his busy weekday schedule. But on vacation, during the summer, or when he’s injured, he does more of it, both for the physical benefits and the mental release.“One of the things yoga shares with running for me is I can use it as that emotional outlet time and to calm myself down,” he says. 5/5 Photograph courtesy of Sally McRae Sally McRae, 37, Huntington Beach, California \n“Sometimes as a professional athlete, you need to do things you don’t like as much in order to continue doing the things you love.” McRae’s sister, a dedicated yoga, frequently asked her along to classes. But the trail runner and ultramarathoner—who’s twice placed in the top 10 at the Western States 100-mile race—always demurred. “I love being outside and moving around,” she says. “The thought of having to sit on my mat for 60 to 90 minutes killed me.” That changed in 2010, when McRae developed IT band syndrome. A physical therapist prescribed stretching and strengthening exercises for her tight and weak hips and glutes. McRae opted to try classes at CorePower yoga instead and found herself pleasantly surprised. The variety of class on offer—hot yoga, yoga sculpt with weights, restorative yoga—appealed to McRae’s athletic side. Meanwhile, she appreciated the opportunity to stay still and listen to her body. Now, though the regularity of her practice varies depending on the season and her racing schedule, yoga holds a place in every training cycle. Restorative classes improve her recovery after weekends when she might put in back-to-back trail runs of 40 and 20 miles. “It’s good at putting my body back together, balancing it back out after I’ve been jostling it for so long on all types of terrain,” she says. Plus, hot yoga helps her prepare for brutal conditions like those she encountered in the Devil’s Ridge 70K in China’s Gobi Desert last September, where she placed second. “Yoga has taught me to be disciplined, to pay attention to myself, to focus when I’m uncomfortable,” she says. “All those things you need to do as a runner.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:12:49.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
