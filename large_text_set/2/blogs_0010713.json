Flynn, a retired U.S. Army Lt. General, quit late Monday after reports that he'd lied to Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials over the details of his communication with Russia's ambassador to the United States .\nDisappointment over Flynn's resignation, 24 days after assuming the role, was felt widely in internet discussion boards like Stormfront and The Daily Stormer, alt-right outlets. Members blamed everyone from the media, Mike Pence, the intelligence community and Jews.\nAndrew Anglin, creator of the neo-Nazi news blog The Daily Stormer offered his own commentary, labeling Flynn as \"one of our best guys,\" and describing the resignation as \"definitely a loss. To the Jews.\" The website's readers agreed, several called Flynn \"the kind of person we need on our team,\" \"stand up,\" and that he was \"too pro-white\" for the administration.\nA prominent \"alt-right\" news blog edited by white supremacist Richard Spencer also aired its dismay over the news, considering the resignation \"a huge mistake.\"\nMichael Flynn was no stranger to controversy prior to his conversation with the Russian ambassador. He used his social media account to spread numerous fake news stories and conspiracy theories relating to Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:52:44.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
