Ahead of the live-action film’s premiere, Emma Watson revealed that Hermione and Belle are “connected ,” and we can totally see it.\nWatson is one of the many stars in the upcoming Beauty and the Beast film , but her role is definitely the biggest. She is playing Belle, who is SO iconic. When talking with Elle UK about her new role, she explained that it actually felt familiar to her role of Hermione Granger in Harry Potter .\n“For me, Beauty was the perfect, most joyful thing to do,” Watson told Elle UK for their March issue.\n“There was something connected about Hermione and Belle, and it was good to be reminded that I am an actress; this is what I do,” she explained. “The film is pure escapism.” While Watson didn’t exactly explain how the two character were connected, we’ve come up with a few reasons ourselves. Prepare yourself, because Hermione and Belle are actually very similar, which is probably why the 26-year-old actress felt so “connected” to both.\nWarner Bros./ Walt Disney Pictures Besides the fact that we love both characters very much, they do share very similar features and characteristics. See what they are below:\nBoth ladies are super smart. We know this is in no way a surprise to anyone, but it is a connection. Each lovely lady is SO smart and witty (and so is Watson herself).\nNeither one is afraid to stand up for themselves. \nEveryone knows that Hermione never backed down from anything, and Belle was so strong. They weren’t afraid of what the men in their lives would think and always stood up for themselves and their beliefs.\nThe girls are total bookworms. If there is one obvious similarity, it’s their love of books. Both Belle and Hermione turn to books for everything . If you can’t find them, they are most likely reading.\nThey believe in magic. \nWhat makes us love these women the most, is their belief in magic. Hermione obviously loves magic because she is a wizard, and Belle sings with clocks and tea cups!\nFierce and feminine can be used to describe both. \nBelle fought the Beast and then protected him from the villagers, while Hermione fought evil wizards and creepy creatures. Throughout all the fierceness, they each kept their feminine side as well, which we totally love.\nThey are definitely childhood heroes. Who didn’t define their childhood by one or both of these fictional heroines?\nBoth are very passionate. \nIt doesn’t matter what these two ladies are doing, they do it with all their heart. They are beyond passionate about family, magic, love, and girl power.\nSassy and sweet should be their middle names. Each woman has both a sassy and sweet side. It makes them more relatable and more lovable. Don’t you think?\nThey care deeply about their families. \nThese two characters are all about family. Belle sacrifices herself for her father’s freedom and health, so yes she loves him. Hermione, on the other hand, erases her parents’ memories to save them pain and loss. It is so selfless.\nThey are both animal lovers. Owls, horses, beasts, or half horse/half bird, it doesn’t matter, they love them all.\nBasically, Hermione and Belle are two of the most amazing female characters ever, which is why Watson is the perfect actress to portray each one.\nBeauty and the Beast hits theaters on March 17th, 2017, and we can’t wait to see Watson bring Belle to life.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:26:39.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
