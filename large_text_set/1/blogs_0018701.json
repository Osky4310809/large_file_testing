Conte insists Costa is staying at Chelsea - for now \nCosta’s current contract expires in 2019 and he was expected to be offered an extension following his sparkling form this season. \nHowever, that appears to have been put on the backburner, with Costa still eyeing a return to former club Atletico Madrid in the summer. \nWhile Costa appears certain to stay until at least the end of the season, defender Branislav Ivanovic looks set to leave Stamford Bridge. \nThe 32-year-old has fallen out of favour this season and Everton are interested in bringing him to Goodison Park to replace 34-year-old captain Phil Jagielka. \nThe England international has been linked with a move to strugglers Sunderland and Ronald Koeman is keen to get a proven Premier League central defender in in his place, according to the Daily Express .
