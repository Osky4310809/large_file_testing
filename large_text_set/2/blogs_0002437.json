Full women coaches!” the Twitter user alleged in a tweet on January 31, which sent The Voice fans into a frenzy that Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, who have both appeared on every season of The Voice to date, could be left out in the cold after Season 12 in favor of Miley, Jennifer, Christina and Celine.\n[Image by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images] NBC have not spoken out about the claims suggesting Celine, Christina and Jennifer will be joining Miley later this year, though rumors have been swirling for months about the possibility of Adam and Blake leaving the The Voice after Season 13 as reports speculated on their possible replacements.\nThe claims come shortly after TMZ reported that NBC want Celine, who is set to appear on Season 12 as Gwen Stefani’s mentor, to appear on The Voice as a fulltime coach and have allegedly done so for a while.\nAccording to a The Voice insider, Celine had allegedly “been approached to do the gig a few times” by The Voice producers, but claimed that Celine has always turned the show down in the past because of her commitment to her Las Vegas residency.\nThe source then went on to confirm that Dion eventually agreed to a smaller commitment, appearing as Gwen’s aid on Season 12, but added that The Voice producers would “have to cough up a lot of dough” to see Celine as a fulltime coach.\nThough if the latest round of rumors are to be believed, there may be possibility Celine could be tempted to join The Voice on a more permanent basis by the promise of an all-female coaching lineup.\n[Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images] Hollywood Life alleged in late December that Jennifer Lopez was supposedly also in the running to be a coach , claiming that she “would consider” joining the show if asked because she has such close ties with The Voice’s network, NBC.\n“[Jennifer] would consider working on The Voice if asked since she has a wonderful relationship with NBC,” a source explained late last year, but claimed that Lopez would turn The Voice down the gig if Fox decided to reprise American Idol , which ended after 15 Seasons last year.\n“If she was asked, she would highly consider it,” the insider alleged of Lopez amid The Voice coaching rumors, “but American Idol would get first dibs.”\nLatin Times then went on to allege that Christina Aguilera, who has already appeared on several seasons of The Voice , may also be in the running to return to her seat alongside Miley after she last appeared on the series during Season 10.\n[Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images] As for Miley Cyrus, she’s so far the only coach to be confirmed for Season 13 of The Voice after NBC said in a statement that Cyrus would be sitting out a round of shows after making her debut last year.\nNBC confirmed The Voice news back in October, revealing their coaching lineup plans for the next two seasons in a statement issued to E! News which announced that former coach Gwen Stefani would be returning to The Voice in Cyrus’s place for the first half of 2017.\n“With Miley returning for Season 13,” The Voice said in the statement prior to the speculation Christina, Jennifer and Celine could be by Miley’s side, “we’re truly ecstatic about the unmatched musical know-how and talent coming together in our coming seasons.”\nWould you watch an all-female season of The Voice with Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez and Miley Cyrus as coaches?\n[Featured Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images and Michael Loccisano/Getty Images]\nMiley Cyrus, Christina Aguilera, JLo, Celine Dion To Coach All-Girl ‘The Voice’? is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:10:15.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
