Published Updated 1:42 pm EDT, December 12, 2016 11 Comments By Brendan Morrow 2k Share Tweet Follow ‘Pokemon Go’ is available for iOS and Android devices. (Niantic) \nUPDATE: Niantic’s announcement has finally arrived, and new Pokemon are indeed coming to Pokemon Go starting today. \nPokemon Go players everywhere are anxiously awaiting the announcement of brand new Pokemon. So when is the big news coming? And where will Niantic drop it? \nLast week, the developer of Pokemon Go revealed that more Pokemon for the game would be unveiled on Monday, December 12th, so we know that we’ll hear something from them today. In the past, the company has always made announcements like these on their website, Pokemon Go Live , which they link to on their social media pages. So far, though, nothing has been posted. \nIf you want to be informed about the announcement at the exact moment it arrives but you don’t want to keep frantically checking various webpages and devices, your best bet would be to follow @PokemonGoApp on Twitter and turn on notifications so you will be alerted whenever the account tweets. You can do this on the Twitter mobile app by going to the Pokemon Go App Twitter profile and then hitting the bell icon. When the announcement comes, it will show up on that Twitter page first. \nNiantic did not specify what time of day the announcement will be posted, just telling players to stay tuned on December 12th. Looking back at their previous news drops, however, they generally tend to make these posts within business hours in California, as this is where the company is located. The time that they make announcements varies, but it seems to come during one of three time periods: around 6:00 a.m., between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., or around 4:00 p.m Pacific Time. \nNobody really knows what news is coming today other than that it will have something to do with the release of new Pokemon. This was specified by the official Pokemon Twitter account last week, which added that trainers would receive more details on December 12th. More Pokémon are coming to #PokemonGO ! Stay tuned for details on 12/12, Trainers! pic.twitter.com/KOfScNpKdr \n— Pokémon (@Pokemon) December 7, 2016 \nThe most common interpretation is that the announcement will concern the release of the second generation of Pokemon. But still some other fans have speculated that it is related to the release of the legendary Pokemon, i.e. Mewtwo, Mew, Moltres, Articuno, and Zapdos. Also, because of this announcement’s close proximity to Christmas, it’s possible the launch of the new Pokemon will be connected to a holiday event, perhaps some sort of “12 Days of Christmas” that culminates on the 25th. \nBefore you get yourself too excited, though, it should be noted that Niantic did not actually say that the release of new Pokemon is coming today. All they’ve said is that the announcement is coming today, and so there’s a solid chance that the actual Pokemon won’t drop until later in the week or, God forbid, sometime next year. \nCheck back in later for more details regarding the Pokemon Go announcement. \nRead more about Pokemon Go in Spanish at AhoraMismo.com:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:50:17.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
