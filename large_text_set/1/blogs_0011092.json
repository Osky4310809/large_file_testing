The people of Biafra shall never succumb to this intimidation. The so-called secret trials will never see the light of the day because my brothers, Nnamdi Kanu and others, did not commit any crime.

Even the military trials, to a large extent, is done openly. I think it may not be proper and not right to try Kanu in secret. \n“Of course, we must all condemn sedition, we must all condemn incitement and unwholesome act to cause disunity in Nigeria but justice must be done and be seen to have been done. \n“The trial should be open, it should be seen to be open so that people will now see that they proved their case . \n“I want to advise the Federal Government to handle that matter in a way that it will not raise further agitation. But all trials should be in open court.” \nCommenting on the state of the nation with regard to the current recession, Uzoma-Abonta, who is the House of Representatives Committee Chairman on Petitions, said: “The state of the nation is a worrisome issue to all of us, particularly to the major stakeholders. \n“There is no gain saying that as we went for the Christmas recess, we saw the impact of recession on Nigerians. \n“Nigerians are very hungry. There is absolute lack of food and want among the citizenry. It is almost an embarrassing situation that people now cannot boast of one meal. The usual rice that people feast on disappeared this festive period . \n“Therefore, we think the government should double efforts in seeing that Nigeria is returned at ease again and solutions must be found. All hands must be on deck so that the populace should be able to feed and be happy again. \n“As it is now, there is a problem of acute starvation and except we do something seriously, there will be problem. We need pure practical economic planning to ensure that Nigerians will eat. I am not talking about luxury, I am talking about basic necessities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T11:11:49.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
