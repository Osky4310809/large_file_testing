They keep losing top defenders to injury. \nCruising 4-0 up against Stoke on Sunday in the Premier League at White Hart Lane, the atmosphere drained out of the stadium early in the second half when defender Toby Alderweireld suffered another injury. \nAfter spending a few minutes on the turf, the Belgium international walked off the pitch, before he had a quiet word with Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino in the tunnel. How bad is the injury? \nHaving walked off the pitch without any need for help, many Spurs fans hoped Alderweireld’s substitution may only be precautionary. \nAccording to journalists near the tunnel at White Hart Lane, Alderweireld indicated to Pochettino that he hurt his leg against Stoke. \nSome claims said the defender had “a little tightness”, while others talked about “jarring”. \nTottenham fans will be hoping for the best, while they are also fretting over the health of Jan Vertonghen after he also had to come a=off in the second half v Stoke. Alderweireld off, chat with Pochettino to explain injury, down tunnel. Wimmer on. 4-0 (49). \n— Tom Collomosse (@TomCStandard) February 26, 2017 #thfc Kevin Wimmer's coming on to replace Toby Alderweireld, who has gone off injured. Seemed to tell Poch he'd jarred something in his leg. \n— Ben Pearce (@BenPearceSpurs) February 26, 2017 Toby was saying he felt a little tightness as he came off. Precautionary, surely. \n— Camden New Journal (@CNJSpursFC) February 26, 2017 You know you're losing badly when opposition manager has relaxed chat with player going off (Poch and Toby) \n— alyson rudd (@allyrudd_times) February 26, 2017 \"-so, mr Pochettino..how's Toby?\"-no big issue..just a knock..no problem.\"(Out rest of the season)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:21:03.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
