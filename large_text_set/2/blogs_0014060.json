The actress/director was in Cambodia, celebrating the opening of her new film First They Killed My Father , and made sure her wardrobe was worthy of such an exciting event. Accompanied by her six children (Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh 10, and twins Maddox and Vivienne, 8), Jolie first walked the red carpet in a sleek black dress .\nBut she really wowed everyone when she slipped into another outfit for the ceremony following the screening. STR Rocking a hot pink dress with puffy sleeves and an open back, Jolie made a fetching picture at the ceremony for the film’s opening. Pink is decidedly ~in~ this season , and the color isn’t always easy to wear — but Jolie made it look effortless. It proved a nice change for the star, who is most often seen in black or muted tones. But for this ceremony and the accompanying celebration, Jolie’s dress mirrored her excited and euphoric demeanor.\nSTR The film and subsequent ceremony have particular meaning for the star, as her son Maddox was adopted from Cambodia when he was a baby. So being able to return to the country having made a film that depicts some of its past trials and tribulations had a special significance for the actress.\nSpeaking of Maddox, here’s the entire squad:\nSTR You also should always have an outfit change handy when you’re about to meet royalty (ya know, like so many of us do). Jolie was presented with flowers by King Norodom Sihamoni. This marks Jolie’s first public appearance since filing for divorce from husband Brad Pitt , and she certainly made it a memorable one.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:18:26.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
