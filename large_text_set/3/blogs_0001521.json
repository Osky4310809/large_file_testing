Listing agent Catherine Jones Coburn with Slifer Smith & Frampton Real Estate said the location really offers the best of both worlds — privacy from neighbors but within walking distance of the slopes and village amenities. \n“It’s right in the center of everything, but the way the lot is situated on the creek and the fact that it’s a large space, you don’t see your neighbors. You get your privacy,” Jones Coburn said. \nEarlier this year, a nearby home with ski-in/ski-out access sold for a record-setting $23 million \nABOUT THE HOUSE: Built in 2011, the tri-level home was designed by local architect Brian Judge of Vail Architecture Group. Eddy Doumas of Worth Interiors oversaw the home’s interior design. \n“The materials both inside and out are strikingly exotic,” Doumas said in a statement. “This home is about the views, simplicity and connection to the environment. The choice of striking and indigenous structural materials is as spectacular as the site itself.” \nThe home’s exterior features oak siding, copper and black-zinc panels and massive precision-cut limestone walls — the latter of which continue inside. Floor-to-ceiling windows let in ample light and geothermal heating, with two miles of in-ground piping, offers energy efficiency. \nInside, the master suite/wing boasts a butterfly roof, private office, walk-in closet, even its own hot tub. Furnishings are high end and custom. Jones Coburn described the home’s aesthetic as “soft mountain contemporary.” \n“It’s still comfortable, it’s cozy, it’s not all glass and steel like you see in all the houses,” she said. “All the furniture is really comfortable and luxurious.” \n“I’ve been selling real estate for 37 years and I’ve never seen a house like this.” \nCONTACT: Catherine Jones Coburn and Donna Caynoski of Slifer Smith & Frampton Real Estate, 970-390-1706 or 970-390-4324 Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T17:48:12.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
