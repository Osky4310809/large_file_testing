Maybe you'll traipse up a massive mountain, or spend all day hopping on one foot? \nBut it can also lead you to do unspeakable crimes against your football team - and that's exactly where Piers Morgan has now found himself, all in the name of Comic Relief. \nLet's bring you up to speed. After his initial promise to be gagged for a 24hr Twitter silence in return for a £5,000 donation was instantly met by Lord Alan Sugar , they upped the ante - with Morgan promising to wear a Tottenham shirt if £50,000 was raised. \nUpon hearing the news, the likes of Gary Lineker, Robbie Savage, Rio Ferdinand, Kevin Pietersen, Holly Willoughby, Bradley Walsh, Jamie Redknapp and Michael Vaughan all confirmed they would donate £1,000 for the cause. \nBut things got serious yesterday when Spurs striker Harry Kane donated £2,000 - promising to DOUBLE it if Morgan kissed the badge as well. Harry's message to Piers couldn't have been any clearer... (Photo: Christopher Lee) \nDespite not hitting the £50,000 target on the Comic Relief donation page , diehard Arsenal fan Morgan has still gone through with the deed - as you can see by this picture posted on Lord Sugar's Twitter: Just look at the anguish on his face... (Photo: @Lord_Sugar/Twitter) \nIt's something Sugar was very pleased to see, as you can see in the video at the top of the page. \nFair play to Morgan - in his own words, he's suffered \"great humiliation for a great cause\" - something many football fans wouldn't do. Maybe he'll start wearing it more regularly if Arsene Wenger stays on for another two years? poll loading Would you wear your fiercest rival's shirt for charity? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:13:58.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
