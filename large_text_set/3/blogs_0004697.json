But before all that she was Mia Thermopolis, and in our hearts she’ll forever be Mia Thermopolis. In 2001, Hathaway perfectly played the world’s most awkward royal teenager in The Princess Diaries , and again revived the role in the 2004 sequel. See where we’re going with this? \nr \nNow, 16 years after what is still arguably her most beloved role, Hathaway may be preparing to dust off her tiara once more in honor of Garry Marshall, the late director who gave her that first big break. \nLast year, Marshall had fans in a tizzy when he spilled the beans that he and Hathaway wanted to film Princess Diaries 3 in Manhattan. \nHathaway was pregnant at the time , meaning the film would have to be put on hold. Tragically, Marshall passed away last July. \nThe film’s other megastar, Julie Andrews, who plays Mia’s grandmother (a queen in every sense of the word) has revealed to BuzzFeed that the idea of a third TPD is still being kicked around. “There’s talk about it,” she said. “And [Hathaway]’s very keen to do it. I would very willingly and happily do it.” She went on to say that the pair just may complete the project in Marshall’s honor. “Annie had an idea that she wanted to pursue about it, and I’m all for it, so if she’d like to…” \nBut don’t get TOO excited just yet. Andrews says that with regard to production, she’s not 100 percent sure where the film is at, with Hathaway’s rep adding that it’s “way too premature to discuss [the] project.” \nIn meantime, we’ll have to rely on the Internet’s well of Princess Diaries fan-fiction . \nAre you keen to see Anne take on her breakout role once more?
