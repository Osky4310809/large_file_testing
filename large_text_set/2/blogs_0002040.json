She would drop jewels on me and call me on sh–, like, ‘You know, it’s not all about you… I think that’s the basis of activism: caring about more than just yourself.” \nShe further expressed how she manages to merge both of her passions, music and activism: “For a while I thought the two things were separate, because people told me they should be separate… But I think conveying the emotion of the collective ‘we,’ something those artists were able to do, is pretty incredible. Especially in tumultuous times like we are in now.” \nKeys also reflected on other aspects of her life, including motherhood, remaining makeup-free, and spending a second season as a judge on The Voice .
