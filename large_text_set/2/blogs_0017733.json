If you have ever thought to yourself “Doesn’t legal understand that we are going to lose this deal if they don’t sign off soon?” or “Why is HR’s answer always  Our rules don’t allow that ?” you are not alone.\nRecent McKinsey research  showed that senior executives have a low level of satisfaction (an average of only 30%) in their corporate functions across the board. McKinsey’s recommendations are all sensible, such as: “Create incentives for functional leaders to contain costs, instead of allocating costs that business units can’t change.” This issue has long been a bugbear for me. Despite chronically low satisfaction and lots of intelligent prescriptions like this, the problem by all accounts seems to be getting worse, not better.\nPerhaps it’s time to go back to first principles, and think about the fundamental structure of corporate functions. Overwhelmingly, they are service providers who are conferred an absolute monopoly right to serve. That is to say, in most corporations, a business unit that has a legal problem can’t just phone up their favorite law firm. They have to call corporate legal, and corporate legal has the right to serve the business unit in question. Corporate legal may hire outside counsel to help, but they manage the relationship. Same with HR. A business unit isn’t allowed to hire an outside payroll provider.\nStep back, then, and ask the question: Where in the world has conferring a monopoly right to serve worked out well for the captive customers over time? I think the definitive answer is nowhere! Governments, of course, have historically been great at giving out monopoly rights to serve. Union shops give out monopoly rights to serve — light bulbs can only be changed by members of the light bulb–changing guild.\nThe result in virtually all cases has been increasingly high costs and increasingly bad service. It is a product of the fundamental structure of the monopoly right to serve. During the 1980s, led by Margaret Thatcher in the UK but followed up around the world, governments addressed the problem of high-cost/low-service government-regulated monopolies by privatizing them. Privatization globally was a mixed blessing. In some cases, it worked splendidly; in other cases, not so much. In my assessment it worked when the privatization eliminated the monopoly right to serve, as was often the case in telecom and sometimes in transportation. When it simply shifted from a government-owned monopoly right to serve to a privately owned monopoly right to serve, it was generally a failure – because the culprit is the monopoly right to serve.\nCompetition is business’s great trainer. It takes business to the gym every day. When a customer chooses an alternative provider, that provides an important signal of how the monopolist needs to get better to get that customer back. If that customer has absolutely no choice, the monopolists learn little or nothing from their behavior. If they complain, the monopolist reaction tends to be to ignore the complaint. Over time, it is darn close to inevitable that the organization protected by the monopoly right to serve will become bloated and unresponsive.\nHence, my belief is that the only way to have efficient, effective corporate functions is to take away their monopoly right to serve. This has happened, of course, with corporate IT. In the late 20th century CEOs became so frustrated with increasing costs without commensurate improved performance in IT that they took drastic measures in eliminating the monopoly right to serve: They outsourced the entire function. The results were so spectacular that it spurred the growth of IT outsourcing into a gigantic global business. And that served as a model for the outsourcing of lots of other corporate functions — parts of legal, HR, employee services, etc.\nThere is also, however, a subtler approach than the extremes of outsourcing or monopoly right to serve that more companies should pursue. That is to open the door to competition just a crack. There is a world of difference between behavior under the monopoly right to serve and behavior when business units can request permission to use an outside service if they are unsatisfied with the monopolist. Losing business every once in a while provides the training that the corporate functions miss when they own an ironclad monopoly right to serve. I know no procedural substitute that comes close.\nIt doesn’t have to happen often — and if it does, the corporate function needs wholesale management change or outsourcing. But that crack in the door is the first-principles solution to the pervasive problem in corporate functions.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:34:44.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
