The eight-core Ryzen 7-1800X was overclocked by Swedish overclocker Elmor, to 5.36 GHz with all its cores and threads enabled, scoring 2,454 points in Cinebench R15, surpassing the previous world record on the HWBot leaderboard held by a Core i7-5960X overclocked at 6.00 GHz, by 9 points. This feat also proves that at high frequencies, the \"Zen\" architecture exhibits higher IPC than Intel architectures such as \"Haswell-E\" and \"Broadwell-E.\" Elsewhere in the world, German overclocker Der8auer successfully overclocked the Ryzen 7-1800X to 5.80 GHz (5802.93 MHz), with a base-clock of 130.4 MHz, and a multiplier of 44.5x, and an insane 1.97V core voltage. The best part? None of the 8 cores or SMT needed to be disabled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T10:41:23.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
