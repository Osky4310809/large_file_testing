By Estelle Tang Feb 22, 2017 The Chainsmokers and Coldplay met while being in alphabetical order in the iTunes store and they have made a \"beautiful\" \"song\" (?) together. \"Something Just Like This\" debuted in a surprise live performance at the Brit Awards, and a lyrics video, which you can watch above, also dropped. We have so many questions. Starting with: What are \"books of old\"? Why did TWO bands need to make this song? What's with the aliens??? Is this....the same song as \"Closer\" (Seriously.) That's really good handwriting in the video, did you do it yourself? No really, is it the same song? I'm so confused. When you say, \"I want something just like this,\" I'm not sure what you're referring to? What exactly do you mean? You keep saying it again and again and I'm not sure I'm getting any clarity on the concept? Wait, a gajillion people have already watched this? Okay, then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:56:55.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
