The 38-year-old comedian took the stage at the 19th Annual Costume Designers Guild Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles on Tuesday, introducing the Florence Foster Jenkins star as the recipient of the Distinguished Collaborator Award. Naturally, his speech was full of jokes and harsh digs.

I explained to Meryl that I was an actor and I was actually about to play the baker in Into the Woods alongside her and she said, 'That's great, I'd like the lemon-encrusted salmon with a Diet Coke.'\" \"What I'm trying to say is, and it's time that someone said it, she's a complete b***h,\" he joked. \"She is the worst.\" The Late Late Show host also spoke out on President Donald Trump's \"over-rated\" tweet about Streep, following her political speech while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award at Golden Globes in January. \"Now listen, I disagree with almost everything that Donald Trump has ever said, but when he tweeted that -- yeah, I'm joking of course!\" he exclaimed. \"It's great to see someone like Meryl finally be recognized with an award. That's what I think. I mean, what is she even going to do with this? This is going to be a door stop for her the Golden Globes room.\" RELATED: Costume Designers Guild Awards 2017: The Complete Winner's List! All jokes aside, Corden was genuinely honored to present Streep with the prestigious award. \"There is nobody else like her, to be truly unique in this world is almost impossible,\" he said. \"There is no one like her, there never will be, and there never has been.\" \"She's a team player, and that is incredibly rare in someone so unbelievably well-decorated,\" he said, adding, \"For everyone in this room, how lucky we are just to be in her orbit for but a moment.\" Lucky, indeed! Following additional remarks by legendary costume designer Ann Roth, the entire crowd was on its feet as Streep made her way to the stage to accept the accolade.

Halloween was maybe like a religious -- no, it was like the run-up to Fashion Week in our house.\" After Streep explained some of the intricate, \"inventive\" costumes her mother designed for her over the years -- Statue of Liberty, a Harem dancer, etc. -- she concluded her speech by thanking all the designers who helped create her most iconic film looks. \"Thank you everybody, I am so grateful,\" she exclaimed. \"So grateful, and I do honor your artistry. I wish I could do it!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:07:03.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
