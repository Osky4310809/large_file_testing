Nokia P1 flagship with Snapdragon 835 SoC and 6GB RAM rumoured to launch at MWC By - January 18, 2017 “The Nokia P1 will be a loaded offering with Carl Zeiss optics and a 3,500mAh battery” \nHMD Global, the new home for Nokia devices, recently launched its first smartphone called the Nokia 6 . Soon after the unveiling, the company sent out invites for an event at MWC next month, where more smartphones are expected to be launched. Ahead of the event, the specs of an upcoming Nokia flagship, allegedly dubbed the Nokia P1, have hit the interwebs. \nAccording to Russian publication Worket , the Nokia P1 flagship’s design will be based on Sharp Aquos Xx3, which was launched in Japan last year. Sharp is owned by Foxconn, which also manufactures Nokia devices, so a similar design seems plausible. While the Aquos Xx3 was a mid-range offering, the Nokia P1 will come with loaded specs. The phone will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC, mated to a beefy 6GB of RAM. The device will offer storage capacity of up to 256GB. \nThe source suggests that the Nokia P1 will feature a Carl Zeiss-certified 22.6-megapixel primary camera. It will feature a 5.3-inch IGZO display with Gorilla Glass 5 protection, an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Android Nougat and a 3,500mAh battery. The device will also have IP57-certification for water- and dust-resistance. \nThe publication suggests that HMD plans to globally sell the Nokia P1 in two variants. The high-end variant will have a ceramic finish and 256GB of storage, while the regular model will have a metal frame and 128GB of storage. The former will be priced at around Rs 64,500, while the latter will set you back by approx. Rs 54,400. Lastly, the source claims that the phone will be unveiled at MWC in February next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T13:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T08:41:59.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
