He set a career high with 39 home runs in 2016. Hitting the 22 he needs to get to 300 in 2017 is a good bet. \nUnlike Beltre and Pujols, who would be voted into the Hall of Fame if they retired today, I think Cano still has some work to do before punching his ticket to Cooperstown. He’s a few years away from 3,000 hits (he has 2,210 at the moment) but he could very well get to 3,000 hits, 600 doubles, and 400 home runs when it’s all said and done. Cano has to hang around a few more years to compile -- his contract with the Seattle Mariners runs through 2023, so that won’t be a problem -- but otherwise he’s already built a strong Hall of Fame foundation. Mike Trout : 200 home runs Can Mike Trout get to 200 career home runs before his 26th birthday? USATSI \nPlaying in the big leagues long enough to hit 200 home runs is an incredible accomplishment and something most players won’t get a chance to do. But, in the grand scheme of things, hitting 200 home runs isn’t that big a deal. A total of 337 players have hit 200-plus homers, and this season Brandon Phillips (197 HR), Adam Lind (186 HR), J.J. Hardy (184 HR), Mark Trumbo (178 HR), and Andrew McCutchen (175 HR) could all join the 200-homer club. \nSo too could Angels wunderkind Mike Trout, who will enter the season with 168 career home runs. My abacus tells me he is 32 dingers away from 200. What separates Trout from everyone else is his age. He’ll be 25 years and 239 days old when the Angels play their first game of the regular season Monday. \nHere are the youngest players to reach 200 home runs: Mel Ott -- 25 years and 144 days Eddie Mathews -- 25 years and 242 days Albert Pujols -- 25 years and 257 days Jimmie Foxx -- 25 years and 266 days Mickey Mantle -- 25 years and 279 days Alex Rodriguez -- 25 years and 289 days Frank Thomas -- 25 years and 360 days Andruw Jones -- 26 years and 61 days Miguel Cabrera -- 26 years and 127 days Hank Aaron -- 26 years and 149 days \nTrout will turn 26 on August 7th, the day the Angels play their 113th game of the season. Can Trout hit 32 homers within the first 112 games of the season to become only the eighth player in history to hit 200 home runs before his 26th birthday? It’ll be tough, but it’s definitely doable. Trout hit his 32nd homer in the team’s 102nd game in 2015, after all. \nThis season Trout, who is sitting on 48.5 WAR for his career, will pass Chuck Finley for the all-time franchise lead. Finley is at 52.2 WAR. Trout will also become only the third player in history to reach 50 WAR before his 26th birthday, joining Ty Cobb (55.8) and Mickey Mantle (52.2). \nThe 2017 season figures to be light on pitching milestones. Clayton Kershaw , James Shields , Max Scherzer , and Jon Lester should all strike out their 2,000th batter at some point this summer, and both Bartolo Colon (17 wins shy of 250) and Francisco Rodriguez (20 saves away from 450) could reach some nice round number milestones. That’s about it. Baseball is a long way away from seeing another 300-game winner (Colon is the active wins leader) while the next 3,000-strikeout pitcher is at least one season away ( CC Sabathia is the active leader with 2,726). \nOn the team level, David Wright needs 11 home runs to pass Darryl Strawberry as the New York Mets ’ all-time home run king, though his health is a major question right now. He’s coming back from neck surgery and is currently dealing with a shoulder issue. Also, Giancarlo Stanton will pass Mike Lowell as the Miami Marlins ’ all-time RBI leader when he drives in his 39th run of the season. He is already the franchise’s all-time home run leader. And, as I mentioned earlier, Trout will soon take over as the all-time WAR leader for the Angels.
