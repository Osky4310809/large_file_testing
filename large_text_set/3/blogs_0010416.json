Worse, the national Capital under the AAP-led government has proved to be a spoiler for such women in distress and trauma. It is learnt that the Delhi Commission for Women has not been able to provide even a single functional One Stop Centre. \n\"We have not received any proposal for setting up any Sakhi centre from Delhi Commission for Women so far,\" confirmed WCD ministry's spokesperson. \nAccording to the WCD ministry officials, 1,143 women were assisted in 83 one-stop centres across the country, barring Delhi within a year of its inception. \n\"The need for one-stop centre in Delhi is a desperate one. We do not have enough centres or counsellors in Delhi who can help women abused at an alarming rate. DCW staff has redirected rape victims to child helpline when they run out of people on their help desk,\" a WCD ministry official told Mail Today. \nThe one-stop centre has come to the rescue of several women who have been exploited and abused in their marital life, 15-year-old abandoned girl child, elderly women sexually assaulted by a minor among many cases. \nIn a list provided by the WCD ministry officials exclusively to Mail Today, 121 functional Sakhi one-stop centres have sprung up till March 8, 2017, including ones in far-flung cities like Port Blair, 13 in Andhra Pradesh, 27 in Chhattisgarh, seven in Haryana and 18 in MP. \nProviding aid to women along the north-eastern belt in India, the one stop centres have come to the redefined the life of a 19-year-old Chandni (name changed) in Nagaland who was abused in a marriage forced on her in which she later opted for divorce and was helped by one-stop centre in Dimapur. \nTalking to Mail Today, the WCD ministry officials said, \"The purpose of these One Stop centres is a rather different and indispensable one. They are temporary habitats for domestic abuse survivors where cases can be followed up to deliver justice.\" For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T04:53:58.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
