The tribe's opposition to the project led to months of protests that were marked by clashes with police. Trends Dakota Access Pipeline \nVictoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, said construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) over sacred tribal sites and through Lake Oahe, the Standing Rock Sioux's water source, was conducted with a lack of respect to the tribe's land rights. She said she is also concerned about how protests of the pipeline were met with aggressive police force. \n\"My impression is that there was unnecessary use of force,\" Tauli-Corpuz told the AP. \"Anybody has a right to protest and express their opposition to what is happening.\" \nTauli-Corpuz made the comments following an official visit to the US to assess the impact of \"energy development projects\" on native peoples. She was invited to the US by Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault, AP reported. She said she will eventually recommend a full study of the DAPL's environmental impact. Her visit to the US included concerns over the Keystone XL pipeline, as well.

He also met with local law enforcement, he said. \nThe escalation of law enforcement activity around the camps contribute to a \"war zone\" atmosphere, John wrote , recommending the US \"swiftly reverse its current approach of criminalizing Indigenous human rights defenders – those standing up for their solemn treaty rights to lands, territories and resources and their inalienable human rights.\" \nTauli-Corpuz previously called on the US to halt construction of the DAPL.

In addition to tribal water supply concerns, the Missouri River is a source of drinking water to millions in the US. The DAPL also represents a continued dependance on fossil fuels, opponents say, which contributes significantly to global climate change. Thousands of people flocked to the area to support the DAPL opposition, leading to hundreds of arrests by at times aggressive , heavily-armed law enforcement.

The tribe claims it was not properly consulted on the project, which represented a threat to its health, based on the pipeline's route through its water source off the Missouri River. \nThe tribe also says the project violates treaty rights agreed to in 1868 with the US government. The tribe has argued that the DAPL also threatens its sacred cultural and religious sites in the area. The defendants in the lawsuit dispute these claims. \nAfter months of indigenous-led opposition, creating an increasingly tense scene at the protest camps, the Barack Obama administration temporarily halted the project's construction through the area. Upon taking office in January, the Donald Trump administration quickly reversed course and approved of the DAPL's advancement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:37:36.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
