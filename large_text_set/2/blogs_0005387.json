File photo \nMANILA, Philippines — An angry President   faced over 200 erring policemen and asked them to prepare to move out. \nDuterte gave the erring cops from the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) two weeks before they move out and get sent out to Basilan to be part of “Task Force South” while they are still young. He said there is a lack of police in conflict-stricken Basilan. \n“Kayong lahat [na] nandito, kasali kayo sa Task Force South. Padala ko kayo sa Basilan. Tumira kayo doon ng mga dalawang taon,” Duterte told the 228 erring police men presented to him at Malacañan. \n“Kung lumusot kayong buhay, balik kayo dito.

Training ko utak ninyo,” Duterte said. \nThe president reiterated his order to have these erring cops clear the portion of the Pasig River of thick water lilies that make it difficult for him to cross from Bahay Pangarap to Malacañan Palace while on board the tugboat. He also threatened them to drink water from the polluted river as retribution. \n“Gusto ko kayo ihulog diyan sa p", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:47:01.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
