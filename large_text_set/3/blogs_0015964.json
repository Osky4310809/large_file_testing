According to Bedell Smith, Charles liked that Camilla was down-to-earth, loved the countryside and wasn’t interested in fashion. They also shared the same sense of humor and he was drawn to the fact that she “always listened.”\nIt seemed natural that Charles would be attracted to upper-class Camilla — Lady Annabel Goldsmith tells Bedell Smith that Camilla was “an intensely warm maternal laughing creature, with enormous sex appeal.”\nDespite having an apparently happy relationship, the two split up when Charles was stationed overseas with the Royal Navy in 1973.\nPatricia Mountbatten, the daughter of the late Lord Mountbatten, tells Bedell Smith there were “obvious problems” with Camilla and she “had a history” — i.e., a sexual past with her on-again, off-again boyfriend (and eventual husband) Andrew Parker-Bowles.\n“You didn’t want a past that hung about,” says Mountbatten.\nWhat’s more, Bedell Smith says that when Camilla and Charles split he was only 24 and wasn’t interested in settling down. Shortly after Camilla and Charles broke up, she reconciled with Parker-Bowles and they got married in 1973.\nBut Charles and Camilla couldn’t stay away from one another for too long. Parker-Bowles was one of Charles’ friends and they all traveled in the same circles. Eventually, the two started up an on-again, off-again affair, with Camilla’s husband turning a blind eye.\nBy 1980, when Charles began dating Diana, the pressure was mounting for him to settle down. Despite their 13-year age difference, Diana seemed like a good match — she was aristocratic, fun-loving, beautiful and didn’t have a known “history.” However, Charles didn’t appear to be in a rush to get married. That changed, according to Bedell Smith, when the press began speculating that Charles and Diana had spent two nights together. (Diana denied the claim at the time.)\nFROM COINAGE: Wedding Etiquette Isn’t Hard, But Just in Case, Here Are Eight Tips \nStill, Prince Philip sent a letter to Charles saying that Diana’s reputation was on the line and that he had to make a decision about their relationship. Charles read it as an order to get engaged, but he “wasn’t in love, he wasn’t ready. Psychologically he assumed his father bullied him, so he read it as a bullying letter,” writes Bedell Smith.\nHowever, Bedell Smith said the letter was more a statement that “Charles should either propose to her or release her. In either event, he should make a decision shortly.” The couple got engaged in February 1981 and were married in July of that year.\nBut the strains around the relationship were already starting to show before the two even walked down the aisle. (Diana famously cried during a polo match ahead of the wedding and had previously said that she had wanted to call everything off.) Bedell Smith writes that the two were just too different — Diana was over a decade younger than Charles and they didn’t have the same hobbies.\nDiana also didn’t take to some of Charles’ more traditional habits. Historian Paul Johnson recalled a story Diana had told him about how Charles’ valet would lay his shirt on the bed before he got dressed and if he wanted a new shirt he would ring the valet to bring him a new one. When she asked why he didn’t get his new shirt himself he replied, “He’s paid to do it.”\nPrince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life (Random House) will be released on April 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T23:34:41.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
