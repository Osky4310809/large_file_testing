Now, he’s splitting his time between two foster families — and packing in lots of fun.\nFirst up on the list was a ride on a Mesa Fire Department fire engine, checked off last Friday.\nThis embed is invalid\nThis Saturday, Rocko is the guest of honor at a brunch at a dog-friendly restaurant with his new family of loving humans, all of whom will bring tennis balls (his favorite!) to put into a kiddie pool in which he can play.\nOther wished-for items include running the bases at the Chicago Cubs training facility in Mesa, an honorary degree from the local community college and walking the beat with police officers as an honorary K9.\nGable promises Rocko’s life will be filled with as much fun and love as possible as he makes his way through his bucket list. Says Gable of the volunteers’ efforts to help: “It’s bittersweet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:49:21.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
