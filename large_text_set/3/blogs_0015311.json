the Australian Open and Indian Wells.\nAfter defeats to Vasek Pospisil and Nick Kyrgios at the BNP Paribas Open last week, both confirmed their withdrawals from the second Masters 1000 event of the year.\nNo one outside of Murray and Djokovic has won the tournament since Andy Roddick beat Tomas Berdych 2010 and the Serbian world No. 2 has been crowned as champion in five of the last six years.\nMiami Open past 10 winners 2016: Djokovic bt Nishikori 6-3 6-3\n2015: Djokovic bt Murray 7-6 4-6 6-0\n2014: Djokovic bt Nadal 6-3 6-3\n2013: Murray bt Ferrer 2-6 6-4 7-6\n2012: Djokovic bt Murray 6-1 7-6\n2011: Djokovic bt Nadal 4-6 6-3 7-6\n2010: Roddick bt Berdych 7-5 6-4\n2009: Murray bt Djokovic 6-2 7-5\n2008: Davydenko bt Nadal 6-4 6-2\n2007: Djokovic bt Canas 6-3 6-2 6-4 Their absence has blown the draw wide open, with Stan Wawrinka now the top seed.\nHere we take a look at the players who could benefit most from their absence and who are likely to be the major contenders at the second Masters 1000 event of the year.\nRoger Federer Federer won Indian Wells (Picture: AFP/Getty) The Indian Wells champion will almost certainly be installed as the favourite to lift his third title of the year in Florida.\nCrucially, after his win in California and the withdrawals of the two top ranked players, the world No. 6 will now be the fourth seed, which will ensure he misses some of the other big names in the event.\nFederer in 2017 Australian Open: Winner – Bt Nadal 6-4 3-6 6-1 3-6 6-3\nDubai: R16 – Lost to Donskoy 6-3 6-7 6-7\nIndian Wells: Winner – Bt Wawrinka 6-4 7-5 Regardless of who he’s facing right now, the 35-year-old is looking close to unstoppable, with only Russian qualifier Evgeny Donskoy upsetting the Swiss so far this year in Dubai.\nHis demolition of great rival Rafael Nadal and comfortable victory over Wawrinka at Indian Wells will only heighten his sense of belief and he will be most people’s pick to win.\nA title for the Swiss in Miami will see him return to the top four in the world and he’ll hope to lift the trophy here for the third time and for the first time since 2006.\nStan Wawrinka Wawrinka was a beaten finalist at Indian Wells (Picture: Getty Images) The top seed was a losing finalist in Indian Wells but was playing well enough to ensure that he will be considered a contender in Florida.\nAn early exit in Dubai, when he was returning from a knee injury, aside, the Swiss No. 1 has been to the semi-finals and beyond in every tournament he’s played this year.\nWawrinka in 2017 Brisbane: SFs – Lost to Nishikori 6-7 3-6\nAustralian Open: SFs – Lost to Federer 5-7 3-6 6-1 6-4 3-6\nDubai: R32 – Lost to Dzumhur 6-7 3-6\nIndian Wells: Final – Lost to Federer 4-6 5-7 He’s not known for his consistency throughout a season but he’ll have the No. 2 ranking in his sights, particularly as Djokovic will lose 1000 points after his injury.\nAvoiding Federer, who has ended his run in two of the four events he’s played so far in 2017, seems vital for his chances, particularly given his 15-0 record against his compatriot on hard courts.\nRafael Nadal Can Nadal bounce back? (Picture: Getty) Another who will be desperate to avoid Federer, Nadal will represent a major threat in Florida.\nThe Spaniard was unfortunate to be drawn against the Swiss so early in Indian Wells but the manner of the defeat will be a cause of great concern to him.\nNadal in 2017 Brisbane: QFs – Lost to Raonic 6-4 3-6 4-6\nAustralian Open: Final – Lost to Federer 4-6 6-3 1-6 6-3 3-6\nAcapulco: Final – Lost to Querrey 3-6 6-7\nIndian Wells: R16 – Lost to Federer 2-6 3-6 He lost to the 35-year-old for the third consecutive time – something that had never previously happened in their lengthy rivalry.\nDespite being without a title so far this year, Nadal has reached two finals.\nHe’s never won in Miami, being a losing finalist on four occasions, but he will hope to change that this year.\nMilos Raonic Raonic has struggled with injury (Picture: AFP/Getty) It’s been an injury-hit start to the year for the Canadian and he’s been out of action since pulling out of the Delray Beach final a month ago.\nHis only defeats this year have come against an in-form Grigor Dimitrov and Rafael Nadal so it’s hardly been a great disappointment so far but after missing Indian Wells he’s largely going under the radar.\nRaonic in 2017 Brisbane: SFs – Lost to Dimitrov 6-7 2-6\nAustralian Open: QFs – Lost to Nadal 4-6 6-7 4-6\nDelray Beach: Final – Sock W/O But, arguably, the big server will be as dangerous as anyone heading into this event.\nHe’s spent the last week in Miami preparing and getting used to the courts and he will be a tough match-up for whoever faces him.\nAnd if he ends up facing Federer at the Masters 1000 tournament, he will do on the back of two straight wins against the Swiss.\nKei Nishikori Nishikori has plenty of ranking points to defend (Picture: Getty) Last year’s losing finalist, Nishikori beat the likes of Roberto Bautista Agut, Gael Monfils and Kyrgios before losing to Djokovic and the Japanese has plenty to play for this time around.\nThe 27-year-old’s good run last year means he has 600 points set to drop off, which will see his ranking plummet to at least sixth if he was to fall at the first hurdle.\nNishikori in 2017 Brisbane: Final – Lost to Dimitrov 2-6 6-2 3-6\nAustralian Open: R16 – Lost to Federer 7-6 4-6 1-6 6-4 3-6\nArgentina Open: Final – Lost to Dolgopolov 6-7 4-6\nRio Open: R32 – Lost to Bellucci 4-6 3-6\nIndian Wells: QF – Lost to Sock 3-6 6-2 2-6 The resurgence of Federer and Nadal will be of great concern but the second seed should be handed a relatively favourable draw and would expect to at least reach the last eight – having done so in each of the last three years.\nHe’s also beaten Federer in Miami in the past and will fancy his chances to go all the way this year without Murray and Djokovic around.\nNick Kyrgios Kyrgios has been in great recent form (Picture: Getty) Tennis fans will feel rightly robbed of what would have been a tremendous quarter-final match at Indian Wells between Kyrgios and Federer, with the Australian pulling out due to food poisoning.\nA losing semi-finalist in 2016, Kyrgios is one of the most dangerous players on the ATP Tour right now and his dismantling of Djokovic in both Acapulco and the BNP Paribas Open should serve a warning as to how well he’s playing.\nKyrgios in 2017 Australian Open: R64 – Lost to Seppi 6-1 7-6 4-6 2-6 8-10\nMarseille: SFs – Lost to Tsonga 6-7 6-2 4-6\nAcapulco: SFs – Lost to Querrey 6-3 1-6 5-7\nIndian Wells: QFs – Federer W/O The way he was serving against Djokovic in both those matches was simply sensational and he seems to have found a new level of focus and belief in his game.\nHe has a good head-to-head record against Wawrinka, Nadal and Federer and everyone will be desperate to avoid him in the draw.\nWhether he can find the consistency to go the whole way is another question…\nMORE: Kyrgios: Just a great match winner or future great champion? \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T11:05:38.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
