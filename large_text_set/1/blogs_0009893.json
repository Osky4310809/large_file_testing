These rodents are mouse-like. See the prominent ears and eyes displayed in this image? You won't see those features on a mole. Peter Freitag/ EyeEm/ Getty Images By David Beaulieu Updated November 25, 2016 . \nYou have heard of mole control, but not vole control? Why is that? Well, the latter gets little recognition. While you may not know the difference between moles and voles , even those who are not landscaping enthusiasts have heard of moles . But most people go their whole lives without ever so much as hearing about voles, let alone controlling them. To make matters more confusing, these pests are sometimes referred to as \"meadow mice\" or \"field mice .\" But when you identify the damage they cause in lawn and garden alike, you'll quickly learn that this is no \" Mickey Mouse \" pest control problem . \nVoles construct well-defined, visible tunnels, or \"runways\" at or near the surface, about two inches wide. Vole runways result from the voles eating the grass blades, as well as from the constant traffic of numerous little feet beating the same path. And if any lawn and garden pest can literally “beat a path” through the grass due to their sheer numbers, it’s the voles. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Get Rid of Voles Rabbits don’t have anything over this prolific rodent! Vole Hole Identification: Voles vs. Moles \nSince voles are not the only animal pests responsible for runways in lawn and garden areas, they are often confused with other pests you'd like to get rid of – namely, moles . Because both moles and voles are rarely seen, it makes more sense to base identification on the signs they leave behind, rather than on how the animals look. After all, you may never come face to face with these furtive, furry foes. \nMoles produce two types of runways in your yard. One runway runs just beneath the surface. These are feeding tunnels and appear as raised ridges running across your lawn. The second type of runway runs deeper and enables the moles to unite the feeding tunnels in a network. It is the soil excavated from the deep tunnels that homeowners find on their lawns, piled up in mounds that resemble little volcanoes. These mounds are a dead giveaway that your problem is not voles, but moles. Voles leave no mounds at all behind. \nPerhaps you have made a positive identification of the culprit: you've got voles. Or perhaps you do not have voles on your landscape, but you wish to find out how to keep it that way. Prevention sure beats battling lawn and garden pests after they've already arrived. By taking preventive measures, you can stick to purely natural pest control, which is beneficial both to your health and to the health of the environment. Natural pest control can also save you money since you won't have to go out and buy pest control products. I'll have more to say about natural pest control against voles in a moment. But first, let's find out exactly what kind of damage voles do to your lawn, garden and landscaping plants . \nVoles can burrow into the root systems of landscaping shrubs and trees, causing young specimens to experience dieback or to begin to lean. These rodent pests will also gnaw on a tree trunk and at the base of a shrub. In addition, voles damage the roots of perennials such as hosta plants , spring bulbs , and the root crops in the garden, such as potatoes. Mainly, however, voles eat the stems and blades of grass . And the runways they leave behind in the process make for an unsightly lawn. Natural Pest Control Measures Against Voles \nA vole pest problem is most likely to arise in yards where voles have abundant amounts of vegetation and debris to hide under and build their nests. If you keep your garden weeded, avoid planting dense ground covers such as creeping junipers and keep your lawn mowed, you're less likely to have to worry about voles in the first place . That's rule #1 of integrated pest management (IPM): preventing pest problems through foresight, rather than waiting for damage to occur and then killing pests as an afterthought. \nBut it's not just vegetation that voles take shelter under. Because vole gnawing will cause damage to trees and shrubs, you have to be particularly careful about applying mulch too close to trees and shrubs. Voles will be emboldened by the presence of a deep layer of mulch. Even in winter, you're not home-free with respect to potential vole damage; voles will use snow as cover to perpetrate a furtive attack on your landscaping. So try to keep snow cleared away from shrubs and young trees. You can also protect young trees by wrapping the lower trunk with a guard (for example, a wire mesh). \nBut what if it's too late for preventive integrated pest management measures? If your landscaping is already being damaged by voles, you need to consider vole eradication. Voles can be removed humanely from a yard by using Havahart live traps , exterminated by using mouse traps or poisons, frustrated by garden fencing , or driven away with vole repellents. Voles can do significant damage to your landscape, so the need for eradication should be taken seriously. In implementing do-it-yourself eradication tactics against voles, or \"meadow mice\" your first choice is between: Exterminating the voles that are damaging your landscaping. Repelling the voles or keeping voles away from plants with fences. Live removal of voles from your yard. Supplies for Do-It-Yourself Extermination: Poison Baits, Mouse Traps \nIf you select extermination, you must then decide between poison baits (rodenticides) and traps. Zinc phosphide-based products such as ZP Gopher Bait are commonly used home rodenticides for vole control. But the two best-known brand names in the poison bait industry, d-Con and Rodex, are Warfarin-based. Warfarin is a blood anticoagulant, causing internal bleeding and hemorrhaging leading to death. \nPoison baits are, of course, potentially hazardous to other wildlife, children, and pets. If you place the poison bait directly into burrow openings, the hazard is reduced. Another tactic the DIY types should consider to make poison baits less hazardous is to place them in bait containers. Trapping Voles With Mouse Traps \nMouse snap traps can be used to trap voles. Situate the trap perpendicular to the vole runway, aligning the trap's trigger with the very path the vole must take in using the runway. Peanut butter is an excellent bait for trapping voles. The best time to trap is either autumn or late winter. Like poisons, however, these traps can be dangerous for other wildlife, children and pets. To minimize the risk, place the traps under boxes. \nThe key to success in trapping is determining where the voles on your landscape are most likely to be passing by -- that's where you want to locate the trap. The widest vole runways are indicative of heavy traffic. Another good indicator is if a runway is heavily soiled with vole urine and feces. Use these same indicators for ideal placement of your poison baits. \nYou want to just drive them away, or at least keep them at arm's length? Then the pest control products for you to consider are vole repellents and rodent-proof garden fencing. \nThiram-based vole repellents such as Shotgun Deer and Rabbit Repellent may be effective against these pests, but they need to be re-applied frequently, since they dissipate with rain. The need for repeated applications raises another problem: meadow mice become accustomed to the smell, reducing the effectiveness of the vole repellent. Keep in mind as well that thiram should not be used on garden plants . Because of the latter restriction, I'd recommend predator urines instead as the vole repellent of choice. Predator odors are most displeasing to voles. Fox and coyote urines can often be bought at trapper supply houses. \nWire mesh garden fencing (hardware cloth) can be wrapped around the base of a young tree in winter to keep voles from gnawing at its bark. Garden fencing can also be placed around garden plants , to protect their roots against voles. Make sure to bury such fencing products at least a few inches (but a couple of feet is preferable, to be on the safe side) beneath the ground surface. \nFumigants and ultrasonic repellers, however, are not effective against voles. The network of tunnels made by the vole is just too extensive for these pest control products to be of much use. Removing Live Voles: Havahart Wire Traps \nBesides fences, a humane option is live removal of voles. You can trap voles and remove them from your landscape, using a small live-trap, such as is put out by the Havahart Company . The problem with these Havahart wire traps, though, is that you still have to get rid of the live vole after you’ve trapped it. In some states animal relocation is even prohibited. So if you don't want to exterminate voles, and if you don't want to repel them, you may have to just live with them.... \n\"What's the big deal, after all?\" some may ask. \"How can it hurt your landscaping to have some little mouse-like pest running around?\" To be sure, for those who love wildlife more than landscaping plants, voles probably are not that big a deal. Indeed, deer pose a much greater threat to landscaping than do voles; yet many diehard wildlife-lovers are perfectly content to provide Bambi with snacks. Different strokes for different folks! Obviously, the present article has been geared to homeowners who wish to protect their landscaping. Those who do not share this wish need no advice from yours truly (or anyone else) on the matter of pest control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:29:18.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
