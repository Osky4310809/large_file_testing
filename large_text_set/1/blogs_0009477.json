No problems. By Estelle Tang Jan 8, 2017 Hosting the Golden Globes is a high-pressure gig. Jimmy Fallon's been facing questions about whether he's going to comment on politics during the ceremony, and the opening number was a silver screen–worthy musical number he led with ease. Plus, the Golden Globes are famous for its shocking, hilarious, and unexpected meme-ish moments. But the biggest challenge of the Tonight Show host's night came, well, as soon as the ceremony started. As Fallon started to address the audience, he seemed a little startled—and for good reason. \"Already the teleprompter is down,\" he said. \"This is a great way to start the show.\" Luckily, he has years of comedy and hosting experience to rely on. \"I can do impressions,\" he offered, as he explained the awkward situation. GIF   Then, he came up with the perfect solution. \"Cut to Justin Timberlake, please. Just wink at me or something.\" GIF Sadly, we we didn't get an impromptu Timberlake–Fallon performance, because the technical snafu was corrected soon enough. But, as Fallon said, in some ways it took all that pressure off: \"Already, you have your Golden Globes moment.\" The rest? A snap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T04:25:08.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
