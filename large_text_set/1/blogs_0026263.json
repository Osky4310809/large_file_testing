At the time, Schneiderman said \"a preliminary review by his office revealed that the company \"may have inserted potentially anticompetitive terms\" into its sales contracts for Epipen \"with numerous local school systems.\" \nIn October, Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle claims that the company shortchanged the Medicaid system by misclassigying EpiPen for the purposes of a drug rebate program. \nMylan did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement. But before the deal was reached, a number of members of Congress had questioned whether Mylan was paying the correct rebate rate for EpiPen to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. \nMylan for years had classified EpiPen as a generic product for the purposes of that program. Generic drugs pay a rebate of 13 percent for sales made through Medicaid, which is the jointly run federal-state health coverage system for primarily poor people. \nBrand-name drugs pay a rebate rate of at least 23.1 percent. But brand-name products whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation can be subject to even higher rebate rates.
