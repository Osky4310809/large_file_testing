Read More Joe revealed his embarrassing inking to the Tattoo Fixers (Photo: E4) The cheeky tattoo seems to suggest Gary Lineker likes crisps more than we thought (Photo: E4) \nJoe told that tattooists that the body art had gained fame on social media and was picked up by national media after his friend Jordan posted a snap on twitter. \nHe said: \"One of my mates decided to post it online and it went viral. \n\"My mum rang me after seeing it in the papers and she was really angry. \n\"I want to get this covered up because it's absolutely ridiculous and it's ruining my life. I'll never get a job.\" Read More Joe was sent by his outraged mum for a cover-up (Photo: E4) Jay and Sketch have seen some awful tattoos but this still shocked them (Photo: E4) \nSketch said: \"I cant even think what was going through your mind that day.\" \nA sheepish Joe replied: \"I didn't really think to be honest.\" \nGary Lineker himself seemed to enjoy the joke when it first came to public attention, as back in August he tweeted: “I’m not sure it’s even possible. Goodness knows, I’ve tried!” \nThankfully he had the terrible tattoo replaced with a large angel, a design he hoped his mum would be more accepting of. \nViewers were in hysterics as Joe revealed his shameful inking on TV.
