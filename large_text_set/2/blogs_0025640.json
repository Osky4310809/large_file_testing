It was slow progress.\nStill, story details are now out there - so be careful where you click online from now until Friday.\nThe game's Wii U version has now been cracked, allowing anyone with the technical know-how to download it and play.\nFans are also picking apart the game's files, and surfacing some spoilery items and location names.\nWe won't list any spoilers here, but for those who do want to risk a peek - here's a couple of the early streams online right now.\nNintendo, for some reason, doesn't seem to be on the ball taking them down - one streamer has been going since last night.\nZelda: Breath of the Wild launches officially this Friday, alongside the arrival of Nintendo Switch.
