Now the Swoosh is back providing a closer look at the performance shoe, in addition to sharing a number of facts surrounding the design. \nAgain, the PG1 is tailored to respond to George’s two-way game. The silhouette then features a distinctive forefoot strap, anchored by Flywire cable loops, and a Zoom Air unit delivering low-profile, responsive cushioning. \nCourtesy of Nike , here are 10 things you might not have noticed upon first glancing at the PG1. \n1. Crusader Crush \nThe Nike Zoom Crusader was George’s favorite basketball shoe until the PG1. Ironically, Hardman designed the Crusader and the snug, seamless fit is reflected in the PG1 design. \n2. The Strap Began With a Sketch \nThe PG1 forefoot strap came directly from George, who showed Hardman a sketch of his dream shoe during one of their initial meetings. \n3. Janoski Inspiration \nElements of George’s favored casual shoe, the Nike SB Janoski, inspired materials and construction subtleties of the PG1. \n4. Traction at Scale \nThe shoe’s traction pattern, which resembles fish scales, reflects George’s love for fishing — a pastime he shares with his father, Paul George Sr. \n5. Personal Growth \nThree small graphic details on the shoe share personal details about George. The medial side of the left shoe is inscribed with “5-1-15,” honoring the first birthday of George’s daughter, Olivia, on his first shoe. His birthday, “5-2-90,” appears on the medial left side. The right heel tab features a stripe — a reminder of the titanium rod used to repair George’s devastating right-leg fracture. \n6. Family First \nFamily ties are also evident in the shoe’s color choices. The PG1 Obsidian colorway injects a nod to his mother, Paulette, with hits of purple on the heel tab and eyelets, and blend with George’s team colors obsidian blue and yellow. \n7. Sophisticated Simplicity \nOn the tongue, the PG logo locks George’s initials into a bowtie — a reminder of his unique blend of simplicity and sophistication. Need more evidence? George drives a Ferrari, but keeps a fishing rod in the backseat in case he spots a place to fish. \n8. Finishing Touch \nTake note of the materials. From hairy suede to scaled leather, Hardman and George made sure each colorway comes complete with a unique (and high quality) feel. \n9. Rated PG13 \nGeorge’s nickname, PG-13, inspires the 13s on the shoe’s heels. \n10. Clouds on Your Feet \nThe PG1 box is adorned with clouds. Why? George’s early ask to Hardman was to design “clouds on his feet.” \nSubscribe to Highsnobiety’s sneaker chatbot on Facebook to receive lightning quick updates on release dates, sneaker street style, shopping tips and more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:02:53.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
