I went to jazz school and some of my favorite bass players were guys who played higher, like Mark King from Level 42 - still my hero. \n\"But ultimately, the bass started getting lower and lower and lower and at some point with Suicidal, it went as low as it can go - it almost went to the ankles. [Laughs]\" \nMetallica bassist continued: \"When I joined Ozzy's band [in 1996] - I remember kind of testing him out. He'd get up in my face onstage and do these crazy things - a very surreal moment for me. [Chuckles] \n\"And I remember, I said, 'I'm gonna challenge this guy! I'm gonna get really low.' Almost like a sumo wrestler. I took it as far as I could and he got down with me and we started doing this dance together. And that's what's turned into what is now called the crab walk. \n\"I remember it was either ' Iron Man ' or ' Sweet Leaf .' I started doing it, he started doing it, and it became a thing, it sort of carried on through the years.\" \nTrujillo concluded: \"But the stance, I believe, naturally came from surfing and skateboarding and growing up with board sports. I love the ocean and the snow, and I think you just naturally kinda get into a physical level of performance the way your life is.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T21:01:23.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
