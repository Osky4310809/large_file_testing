Fifty-five of them were office workers and 56 delivered post for a living. \nThe study revealed those who had desk jobs registered a bigger waist circumference - 97cm compared to 94cm - and approximately one BMI unit difference. \nThey also had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease - 2.2% compared to 1.6% over 10 years. \nThe research suggests waist circumference increases by two centimetres, and risk of cardiovascular diseases by 0.2%, for every additional hour of sitting on top of five hours.

You'd need to walk 15,000 steps a day to mitigate the risk (Photo: Getty) \n“The levels associated with zero risk factors were walking more than 15,000 steps per day, which is equivalent to walking seven to eight miles, or spending seven hours per day upright.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T03:09:29.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
