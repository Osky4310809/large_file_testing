Of course, different people have different needs and dogs are unique individuals, so it's essential that a dog trainer/teacher be well versed in dog behavior and various principles of ethology/ animal behavior and psychology. They also need to be able to assess the nature of dog-human interactions. Source: usernetsite free images \nIn her essay called \" OCCUPATIONAL LICENSURE FOR PET DOG TRAINERS: DOGS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO SHOULD BE LICENSED ,\" Elizabeth Foubert notes, \"In the United States anyone can work as a dog trainer, regardless of the person’s qualifications. Scientific research in animal behavior and canine ethology indicate how to humanely train dogs, but nothing in the law requires that dog trainers apply these proven methods in practice. Dog trainers may use training techniques that bring harm to dogs and deceive consumers as to its efficacy. The onus is on consumers to educate themselves to these dangers when selecting a 'qualified dog trainer.'\" \nThere's a lot at stake when a person entrusts their dog's life to a trainer. Thus, I was shocked to learn that in the United States anyone can call themself a \"dog trainer.\" I went online and did many different searches, and while there are many excellent certification programs, it is the case that anyone can legally hang up a shingle that says \"Dog Trainer\" and begin to work with dogs and their humans. I also queried a number of trainers and they also agreed that there really is a \"dirty little secret\" about which many, perhaps most, people are unaware, as I was. And, if course, it's not a little secret at all, but rather a huge one, because of the incredible damage that can be done by someone who isn't trained to be a dog trainer. Of course, certified dog trainers also can cause harm but that goes beyond what I want to write about here. \nA dog named Sarge: Justice is a dog's best friend \nLast week I wrote an essay called \" A Dog Named Gucci: \"'Justice Is a Dog's Best Friend' \" about a severely abused dog named Gucci who catalyzed changes in legislation in Alabama (and in other states) that resulted in dog abuse being elevated from being a misdemeanor to a felony. Coincidentally, as I was pondering what to do with this newly discovered and depressing knowledge, I received the following email (reprinted here with permission of the sender): \nMy puppy, Sarge, was attending daycare, where they use dominance based techniques. He was dead within 2 hours of a cruel tactic used on him. \nSarge was a 3 ½ month old Shih Tzu/Pekingese mix. He weighed 8 pounds. \nBecause Sarge wasn’t ‘heeling’, the trainer grabbed Sarge and held his mouth closed with his right hand while holding his neck with his left – Sarge thrashed and collapsed. The trainer said, ‘that’s normal, because he’s a puppy, he exerted all his energy’ – and ‘I won that battle, but you may not next time because he is strong’. I said, ‘but his eyes are glazed over, and his tongue is hanging out’. The trainer made Sarge get up. Sarge tried, but collapsed again. \nI first took him to the training facility's veterinarian close by. I was then referred to the emergency clinic. I believe Sarge died in my arms as I was entering the door of the emergency vet; I could feel his heartbeat fading. He suffered terribly and had a hard time breathing his last two hours. \nIncidents reported for this particular training facility ... date back to 2004. \nDog training that harms dogs is abuse. The person who sent this note asked to speak to me about her and others' attempts to introduce legislation for insuring that dog training techniques are safe. I called her and I was astounded to learn more about Sarge's treatment and death. I wish I were dreaming , but I was not. \nThere also is another widely publicized case about dog training and abuse. In December 2016, dog abuse at a training facility in Oceanside, New York , led to a call for legislation calling for a state-issued license for dog trainers “ t o curb the unregulated practice of individuals claiming to be dog-training experts . ” (You must subscribe to be able to read the article.) \n\"Don't settle for smoke and mirrors\" when it comes to selecting a dog trainer \nThe purpose of this short piece is very simple, namely, to alert people that dog trainers can legally range in education from being highly educated about dog behavior to knowing little to nothing about dog behavior. Many Psychology Today readers live with dogs and I've heard from them from time to time with questions about behavior and other matters of dog. \nTo sum up, there simply are no dog training regulations of which the people with whom I spoke or I are aware. Elizabeth Foubert's excellent and well-researched essay confirms this fact. The Academy of Dog Trainers rightfully has called for transparency. They write : \nWhat should owners look for in a dog trainer? If you ask us, the most important thing is **transparency**. If a dog trainer is not willing to fully disclose, in clear language, exactly what will happen to your dog (in the physical world) during the training process, keep shopping. Look for verbs, not adjectives. Demand to know what specific methods will be employed in what specific situations. Don't settle for smoke and mirrors. \nAmen. \nThere really is a \"dirty little/huge secret\" in the world of dog training that many so-called trainers want to push aside and many others want to expose and change. I hope that Sarge's and numerous other stories will lead to enforceable legislation that will make it a requirement for all dog trainers to be rigorously tested about dog behavior, about the dog-human interactions, and to be formally certified. \nAll dogs who need training depend on their humans to make the best choice possible. We owe it to them to do the best we can and to be sure that when we entrust our dogs' well-being and lives to someone who calls themself a trainer, that they really are qualified to work with these highly sentient beings and their human guardians. Dogs and humans beware. \nPerhaps, sometime in the future, there will be a film called \"A Dog Named Sarge\" that will have a similar effect to that of \"A Dog Named Gucci,\" namely, to generate compelling grassroots and legislative support to develop laws so that dog trainers who abuse dogs pay for their crimes. Transparency and regulation are essential. \nDog training can be abusive, and we must do all we can to make sure it is not. \nNote: For more on some recent legislation for dogs please see \" Dogs, Dominance, Breeding, and Legislation: A Mixed Bag .\" I thank Tracy Krulik for doing some research for this essay. \nAnonymous and ad hominem comments will not be accepted. \nMarc Bekoff's latest books are Jasper's Story: Saving Moon Bears (with Jill Robinson), Ignoring Nature No More: The Case for Compassionate Conservation, Why Dogs Hump and Bees Get Depressed: The Fascinating Science of Animal Intelligence , Emotions, Friendship , and Conservation, Rewilding Our Hearts: Building Pathways of Compassion and Coexistence, and The Jane Effect: Celebrating Jane Goodall (edited with Dale Peterson).
