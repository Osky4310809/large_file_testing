Officers responded to the scene for a report that a woman was found on the ground, unresponsive. \nThe woman was pronounced dead at the scene. \n“It would appear, at this point, that she may have suffered one or maybe two gunshot wounds,” Lt. Andrew Schurman, of the Allegheny County Police, said. \nAuthorities also said there were no reports of shots being fired in the vicinity Friday night or Saturday morning. \n“It does appear she may have been shot elsewhere and transported here, but we’re not sure at the moment if that’s factual,” Schurman said. \nThe woman’s body was sent to the medical examiner’s office for an autopsy. She has not yet been identified. \n“Where it happened is secondary to the fact that someone lost their life through senseless gun violence,” Braddock Mayor John Fetterman said. “So wherever it occurred, someone lost a sister, someone lost a mother, somebody lost a friend, and of course, no one wins in those kinds of situations.” \nThe investigation is ongoing. \nAnyone who believes they saw anything suspicious in the area late Friday night or early Saturday morning is asked to call the Allegheny County Police at 412-473-1300 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T18:56:46.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
