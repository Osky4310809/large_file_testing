The Blues remain in control of the title race, but as one of the last teams to play this weekend, there will be a degree of pressure on them to perform at the London Stadium. However, manager Antonio Conte has seen his team rise to so many challenges in 2016-17 he'll be expecting standards to be maintained here. Although West Ham beat a second-string Chelsea team in the EFL Cup earlier in the campaign, they're still waiting for that big win at their home in the Premier League. Manager Slaven Bilic will hope to see his team respond to the challenge the leaders will pose. Expect a feisty atmosphere under the lights in east London, as the Blues look to make another big step towards the title. Here's all the crucial information you need ahead of the big game. Date: Monday, March 6 Time: 8 p.m. (GMT), 3 p.m. (ET) TV Info: Sky Sports 1 (U.K.), NBC Sports (U.S.) Live Stream: Sky Go (U.K.), NBC Sports App (U.S.) Team News West Ham: The major blow for the Hammers is that Michail Antonio will not be available following his red card against Watford last time out. But Bilic has suggested Andy Carroll should be fit to feature in a boost for West Ham. Likely XI: Darren Randolph; Cheikou Kouyate, Jose Fonte, Winston Reid, Aaron Cresswell; Pedro Obiang, Mark Noble; Sofiane Feghouli, Robert Snodgrass, Manuel Lanzini; Andy Carroll Chelsea: With a fully fit squad to choose from, the biggest selection dilemma for Conte will be whether to recall Nemanja Matic into the starting XI or stick with the in-form Cesc Fabregas . Away from home, Matic's defensive qualities will likely see him get the nod. Likely XI: Thibaut Courtois; Cesar Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Gary Cahill; Victor Moses, N’Golo Kante, Nemanja Matic, Marcos Alonso; Pedro, Diego Costa, Eden Hazard Team news courtesy of Fantasy Football Scout Preview IAN KINGTON/Getty Images With just 12 Premier League games to go, it's going to take a remarkable collapse from Chelsea if they're to surrender their comfortable position atop the table. This match, away from home against a big rival, is one of the fixtures in which there is potential to slip up, so Conte will want to see his players turn in a professional display. The big news for the Blues this week ahead of the game was that Moses has signed a new contract with the club following a tremendous season. He'll return to West Ham feeling as though there's something for him to prove: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk April 2016—West Ham reject chance to sign Victor Moses permanently March 2017—Victor Moses signs new contract—commits to Chelsea until 2021 https://t.co/oFexYkxDsP 3/1/2017, 1:27:27 PM In many ways, the wing-back is indicative of the excellent work done by Conte since his summer arrival. Like plenty of players in the squad, Moses has a renewed appetite to his football, has been willing to work hard for the cause and has been exceptional in adapting to a new system at Stamford Bridge. Moses' blistering raids down the right flank have been a crucial attacking weapon for Chelsea, although the three men up top pose the most potent danger to the West Ham back four. Chelsea possess so much attacking quality. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images Pedro is enjoying a tremendous second season in English football, while Hazard continues to sprinkle stardust all over the field with his forays infield from the left flank. Costa, meanwhile, is a wrecking ball up top and his goals-to-game ratio is pretty special   as noted by OptaJoe : OptaJoe @OptaJoe 54% - Diego Costa has scored in 42/78 PL apps (54%); a higher proportion than any other player to play 20+ games in the competition. Star. https://t.co/C6ezxw1eEX 2/25/2017, 4:44:57 PM West Ham have improved in recent weeks, with Fonte settling them down in defence and Carroll offering a focal point. Against Watford they took a while to get going, although they really should have won the game after a dominant second-half performance and an equaliser from Andre Ayew. With little danger of being dragged into a relegation battle, the hosts can approach this one under no pressure and seek to open up some weaknesses in the Chelsea side. However, the Blues have become so functional in their play as of late and will subsequently have enough to edge an intriguing contest. Prediction: West Ham 1-2 Chelsea  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T10:32:41.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
