That doesn't mean he doesn't want to try. \n\"I want to make it hard for the manager to leave me out,\" Origi told the Liverpool Echo . \"When he has a problem choosing his team then that can only be a positive. Competition for places can only be good for the club.\" Divock Origi scored in five consecutive games, but has started just one Premier League game since then. \nThe Belgium international has scored four goals in 15 Premier League appearances this season and scored in five consecutive games in all competitions between November and December. \nSince then, he has started one league match -- in the 1-1 draw away to Manchester United on Jan. 15 -- and has scored only once, accounting for Liverpool's only goal in a 2-1 home loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers in a fourth-round FA Cup game. \nKlopp has frequently turned to Philippe Coutinho , Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane as Liverpool's first-choice front three, with Daniel Sturridge in and out of the side. \nThat means Origi will likely have to stake his claim for a spot in training. \n\"I want to play. I want to earn that place,\" Origi said. \"To do that you have to show everything in training. You have to give everything and earn it. That's my main focus. To give everything I have. \n\"When you don't play, you want to do everything you can to change that. I need to stay calm and work hard.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:47:57.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
