She is on home assignment until the legal issues are resolved, and our internal investigation is complete.\n“One of our responsibilities when learning of serious allegations is to conduct our own internal investigation. That is ongoing.\n“The investigation is undertaken by the HR department. An investigation can take some time, or it can conclude quickly. Every situation is unique.\nIt’s all done according to the conditions of our collective agreements. She is on home assignment until the legal issues are resolved\n“In some cases, it can depend on our access to information and how co-operative everyone is. I really can’t say how long it will take.”\nCicci was arrested along with Milan Todorovic, 58, of Niagara Falls following a Niagara Regional Police drug investigation.\nPolice officers from the morality unit executed three search warrants at two dwellings and one vehicle in Niagara Falls. They seized cash, cocaine and items used for trafficking controlled substances.\nTodorovic is charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime.\nBoth Cicci and Todorovic were released from custody from the police station pending a future court date.\nA letter from Power Glen School has been sent to the parents of children in Cicci’s class informing them about what has happened, Sweeney said.\n“Part of the process is communicating with parents,” he said. “The letter lets them know there is going to be a change in the classroom and a new teacher will be taking over.\n“The school is absolutely committed to ensuring the students’ educational needs are being met.\n“The school is working on a long-term plan for the classroom; but, in the interim, a supply teacher has come in. She is excellent and enthusiastic and excited to be working with the students.”\nThe children in Grade 2 are seven and eight years old. Sweeney said the school helps them deal with the situation in an “age-appropriate fashion.”\n“The students were told that Ms. Cicci would be off for a while to deal with a personal matter,” he said. “From their perspective, it is very much a normal process, much like when a teacher is going to be off sick. We try to make it as normal as possible for the students.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:41:20.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
