Unfortunately, if you want to listen to your music and see a visual representation of the audio playback, you would usually have to remain within the music app.\nThat can be a bummer since it means you can’t enjoy music visualization while browsing the XDA forums. Thankfully, there’s an app to solve that problem. Enter MUVIZ : a one-of-a-kind music visualizer.\nFor those of you who don’t know what music visualization is, it’s a feature in most music apps where animated visuals are displayed in accordance with the current song. Usually, the visual changes based on the song’s loudness or tempo, but other factors can be used to generate a visual. Some custom ROMs support a feature called “Pulse” which is an integrated music visualization solution, but most users aren’t so lucky to have such a feature. That’s where MUVIZ comes in.\nMUVIZ Nav Bar Audio Visualizer MUVIZ is an innovative audio visualizer that works on almost every Android phone running Marshmallow (6.0) and above. The application is free for download on the Google Play Store . Once installed, the application displays a customizable music visualization at the bottom of your display. The visual rests underneath the navigation bar for devices with on-screen nav bars, while on devices with hardware buttons the visual lies right above the hardware keys.\n\nCustomization options are numerous, as expected of a music visualization application. Though, since there is limited space to display any visuals (the bottom of your screen is fairly crowded after all), you can’t display the kinds of fancy graphics that you would expect from your typical music visualizer. For now, though, you can customize the shape, color, size, and spread of the points on the visualization graph. Furthermore, there’s a list of beautiful preset designs for you to choose from in case you aren’t satisfied with your own creation or just want to pick something neat to look at and get on with it.\nThough the application does not work with every music application on the Play Store, it should work with most of the popular offerings out there. Furthermore, the app can also work on top of videos (useful if you have a video of song lyrics) in apps like YouTube or MX Player. We recommend just giving the app a shot to see how it works for you. It’s free, so you can quickly decide if something like this is up your alley.\nDownload MUVIZ from the Play Store!
