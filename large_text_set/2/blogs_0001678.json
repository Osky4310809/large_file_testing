The jury also announced that Oculus was not guilty of misappropriating trade secrets. \nJudgments are still being handed down in court, and this post will be updated as we hear more, but it seems that Facebook’s investment in VR will be growing more complicated. What this means for Facebook’s future VR efforts and sales of the Rift is unclear. \nUpdating \nZeniMax Media is likely not a company that you’ve heard of, but if you follow the video game industry at all, some of the titles the company’s subsidiary studios have released will immediately stick out. ZeniMax owns Bethesda Softworks, which has published games like Skyrim (one of the best-selling video games of all time) and the Fallout series. The popular franchises carried by its several subsidiaries have earned ZeniMax a reported valuation of as much as $2.5 billion. \nZeniMax Media filed suit against Palmer Luckey and Oculus VR on the following 7 counts, here’s the gist of the claims: Common Law Misappropriation of Trade Secrets The big one: ZeniMax claims that its trade secrets revealed to Luckey under NDA and known to a handful of ex-ZeniMax employees now at Oculus have been used to build the Rift headset’s core technologies. Copyright Infringement Oculus and its team utilized ZeniMax’s “DOOM 3: BFG Edition” as a title to showcase the Rift to investors which ZeniMax claims was done without its permission. More salacious is the claim that some of the SDKs which Oculus VR distributed utilized ZeniMax code. Breach of Contract Here, ZeniMax claims that Luckey violated the terms of a non-disclosure agreement which he signed on May 24, 2012. Unfair Competition Basically, by using Zenimax’s trade secrets to build the Rift, the company claims Oculus has taken away their ability to release a VR product based on their own unique technologies. Unjust Enrichment ZeniMax suggests here that Oculus VR and its employees have unjustly profited off ZeniMax technologies to the tune of billions of dollars. Trademark Infringement Again, ZeniMax calls out Oculus VR for using owned trademarks like that of “DOOM 3: BFG Edition” without the company’s permission, a claim Oculus has denied is accurate. False Designation Finally, ZeniMax claims that Oculus VR purposefully misled the public into thinking that their headset was endorsed by ZeniMax or its employees or was in some way affiliated with the company or its products. \nAll of these counts circle around to the point that ZeniMax Media believes that they were instrumental to the success of Oculus in a way that they should be compensated for. The jury has already handed down judgments on a couple of these claims, we’ll see what more is to come.
