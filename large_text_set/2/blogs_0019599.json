Jamie Lovett Back to Article Image of \nThe fourth season of Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD has been full of surprises, including the twists and turns involved in dealing with Life Model Decoys and all-powerful mystical tomes like the Darkhold, but could there be a more personal twist on the horizon? \nMarvel’s Agents of SHIELD Season 4 marked the first time that Agent Leo Fitz ’s father has been mentioned. The notion came up in relation to Dr. Holden Radcliffe, Fitz’s friend and mentor who betrayed Fitz and the other SHIELD agents. \nThe reason that Radcliffe’s betrayal hurt Fitz so badly is because the two shared a natural bond, a like-minded connection over everything from dangerous science to soccer. They’re also both Scottish, which has led some fans to wonder if Radcliffe could somehow actually be Fitz’s father. \nShowrunner and executive producer Jed Whedon sees where the idea could make sense, but denies that it is the case. \n“ They’re both Scottish, and we’ve discussed it at length,” Whedon tells EW . “Truthfully, there’s no one better to play his dad than John Hannah, but no, Radcliffe is not his father.” \nThat’s one fan theory down, but that doesn't mean that all questions about Fitz’s dad are now answered. As we saw in the stunning conclusion to the “LMD” story arc, the Fitz and the other agents are now in the Framework, where a virtual copy of everyone in the entire world, and even some people who left the world behind, exist. \nMore Marvel's Agents of SHIELD: Showrunner Jed Whedon Talks \" LMD \" Finale Twists / Is Nick Blood Returning? / Agents of SHIELD Becomes Agents of Hydra \nAida also fixed one major regret for each agent as she uploaded them into the Framework. This means that Fitz’s father is likely in the Framework somewhere. We know that Fitz is living the life of a wealthy tech mogul in the Framework. Could his commercial success have been borne from an improved relationship with his father? \nFans will have to wait until Agents of SHIELD returns on April 4 to find out. \nAs of its fourth season, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD has a 3.74 out of 5 on ComicBook . com's user rating, ranking it #18 on our list of user's favorite television shows.
