Well deserved! Just the beginning! — Derek Carr (@derekcarrqb) February 11, 2017 \nDel Rio took over for Dennis Allen, who led the Raiders to a 3-13 record during his final season with the team in 2014. \nUnder Del Rio, the team saw dramatic and immediate improvement as Oakland finished 7-9 in 2015. Del Rio followed that up by leading the Raiders to a 12-4 record in 2016 and the team's first playoff berth since 2002. Although the Raiders' season ended on a low note with an injury to Carr and a playoff loss to the Texans , Davis clearly has high hopes for the team going forward. \nWith Del Rio's extension, Davis might have been trying to tie his coach together with general manager Reggie McKenzie. McKenzie signed a four-year extension in June 2016 that will keep him with the Raiders through the 2019 season. \nUnlike most coaches, Del Rio has had to deal with nonstop relocation chatter, which is probably one of the reasons why Davis decided to do the extension now. With the extension out of the way, Davis can focus on getting a new stadium for his team. \nAs for Del Rio, he's going into his third season with the Raiders after spending three years as the Broncos ' defensive coordinator. Before that, Del Rio served as the Jaguars ' head coach for nine seasons (2003-11). Del Rio went 68-71 during his time in Jacksonville and led the Jaguars to the playoffs twice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:54:14.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
