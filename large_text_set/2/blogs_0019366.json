Advertisement \nOnly one player, defenseman Troy Stecher, has received a confirmed diagnosis of the virus. The other four—Markus Granlund, Michael Chaput, Christopher Tanev and Nikita Tryamkin—have shown symptoms and are being quarantined in isolation for a five-day period or until they definitively test negative for mumps. \nThe players went into quarantine yesterday; as of Saturday afternoon, there are no new diagnoses . The rest of the team is being tested for the virus and vaccinated if needed, alongside other preventative measures . A representative from Vancouver Coastal Health said yesterday that of the five players currently affected, only one has received a full set of vaccinations . But as the NHL’s last mumps outbreak showed, vaccination isn’t always a protection against the virus.
