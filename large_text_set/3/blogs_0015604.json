If you’ve driven past (or just taken a look around while waiting in line for Sqirl) lately, you’ll notice the former Amalia’s restaurant undergoing a pretty stark transformation, with plans to reemerge later this year as an indoor-outdoor stunner that’s a great fit for the hip enclave.\nMelody is the work of several folks, among them Eric Tucker, David Andreone, beverage lead Matt Seigel (formerly of Eleven Madison Park), and chef Colin Akiyama (Bucato, Little Fatty). The idea is to offer a casual evening option for folks in the neighborhood to dine and drink at, with a large patio under a tree and some seamless windows that show off the indoor-outdoor appeal. Inside there will be a long bar and small separate section meant for oysters and the like, plus some communal seating and maybe a booth or two.\nThe place is still under heavy construction at the moment, but is tracking for an opening later this year. That should put Melody right on target with much of the rest of the neighborhood, which has been fluctuating over the past year or two with new ideas and concepts. The Trejo’s Tacos team exists just down the street and Sqirl is still hoping to open their adjacent Sqirl Away space soon as well. Add in the recently razed Cha Cha Cha , and suddenly Virgil Village is starting to look quite different indeed.\nMelody \n751 N.
