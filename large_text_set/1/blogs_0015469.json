Though he still acts and makes us laugh more than ever in so doing, he picks his projects more carefully, tends to work with creators possessed of particular visions ( Wes Anderson comes to mind), and at times apparently lives his life like a form of self-satirizing performance art, popping up now and then in the least expected places amongst the least expected people. Fans of Murray’s from his Caddyshack , Stripes , and Ghostbusters days certainly wouldn’t expect to see him, for instance, at a poetry reading, much less onstage, much less reading seriously. \nAnd yet here we have three examples, captured live, of Bill Murray’s poetry-reading acumen. Up top, you can watch him read former Poet Laureate of the United States Billy Collins’ “ Forgetfulness ” at the 16th Annual Poets House Walk Across the Brooklyn Bridge. Just above, at the same event, Murray reads “ Brush Up Your Shakespeare ” by songwriter Cole Porter from the lyrics of Porter’s musical Kiss Me, Kate . Below, at the Poets House Walk dinner, he reads “ What We Miss ” by Sarah Manguso. We’ll add those three to the list of voices Murray’s performances have done justice — a list that includes such illustrious figures real and imagined as Wallace Stevens , Emily Dickinson , and Drs. Peter Venkman and Hunter S. Thompson . \nRelated Content:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T03:27:24.453+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
