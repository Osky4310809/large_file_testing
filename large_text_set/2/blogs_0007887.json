He was a doctor at Missouri Baptist Medical Center employed by BJC Medical Group. \nMcGurk's body was discovered Thursday on rocks just above the shore near his resort on the island of Middle Caicos, police said. The cause of death was not immediately reported. \nMcGurk had last been seen Feb. 6 when he checked in to Blue Horizon Resort. He was reported missing by the resort Wednesday. \nThe body was spotted Thursday, but authorities had difficulty recovering it due to the location and the tide, police said. The U.S. Coast Guard was assisting. \nDr. Doug Pogue, president of BJC Medical Group, issued a statement Sunday confirming McGurk was a doctor at Missouri Baptist Medical Center. \n“We are shocked and saddened to have been informed by family members of the sudden passing of our friend and colleague Dr. John McGurk,\" the statement said. \"Our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with his loved ones at this difficult time, along with his practice partners, staff and all those who worked with him at BJC Medical Group and Missouri Baptist Medical Center.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:14:13.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
