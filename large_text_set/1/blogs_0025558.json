Hussen said it was unclear how many people would be eligible, given that only a handful of passengers heading to the US had been denied boarding at that point. \n“Let me assure those who may be stranded in Canada that I will use my authority as minister to provide them with temporary residency if they need it,” said Hussen, who was born in Somalia and came to Canada as a teenage refugee.

So far, senior advisers in the Trump team have suggested Canada will not be a target in the trade negotiations, leaving Canadian officials scrambling to contain any potential collateral damage. \nTrudeau instead posted a series of tweets highlighting the stark difference between the position espoused by the Canadian and American governments. “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,” Trudeau tweeted on Saturday.

On Tuesday, two people remained in critical condition. \nAlexandre Bissonnette, a 27-year-old university student, has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five charges of attempted murder. \nThe act was swiftly denounced by Canadian politicians of all stripes. “Make no mistake, this was a terrorist attack. This was a group of innocents targeted for practising their faith,” said Trudeau. “To the more than one million Canadians who profess the Muslim faith, I want to say directly, we are with you. Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours.” Justin Trudeau's tweets won’t make Canada a refugee haven—but popular pressure can | Martin Lukacs Read more \nIt was a contrast to the United States, where the Trump administration pointed to the attack on a Muslim place of worship to defend the travel ban from seven predominantly Muslim countries. \nAfter telling reporters that President Trump had phoned Trudeau to offer the condolences and prayers of Americans, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, glossed over the fact that all six victims were Muslim men, allegedly killed by a young man described by friends as being pro-Trump, anti-immigration and far right. \n“It’s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant,” Spicer said of the attack. Alluding to Trump’s travel ban, he added: “And why the president is taking steps to be proactive, not reactive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T18:23:02.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
