The forwards are the first ones who go to press. \n\"In order to win trophies, you have to defend well. Leaving the goalkeeper with nothing is a good omen for us.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:07:12.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
