He made a post on his blog FXRant where he very correctly shocks Star Wars fans minds by pointing out that the climactic scene of the original film, where Luke and the rest of the rebel pilots fly into the Death Star’s infamous trench is not where you think it is. 2 \nThe place everyone assumed the rebels attack is the horizontal (or East/West) trench. \nHowever, the trench attacked is actually one of the vertical (North/South) trenches. They flat out show you this in Star Wars, but it was ignored by fans everywhere. 3 GIF \nFrom FXRant: “The scene of General Dodonna briefing the Rebel troops contains some computer graphics displayed at the front of the room. As Dodonna describes the challenges ahead, the audience can see quite clearly that the trench that contains the exhaust port is perpendicular to the equator. It was there the whole time. 4 GIF \nStill not buying it? Compare the two trenches in the film. \nHere we can see the Millennium Falcon being pulled into the Death Star via tractor beam. This is at the horizontal trench. Notice the lights, the massive size. Notice the hanger bays which house hundreds of tie fighters inside as well as could fit the Falcon with tons of room to spare. 5 \nNow compare it to the climactic trench run (North/South). Advertisement 6 GIF \nIt is small. X-Wings and Tie Fighters are cramped. There are no lights. In fact it seems to be more utilitarian, exactly where an exhaust port might be found. \nBOOM. 7 GIF \nAlso, as long as we are blowing minds, have you ever noticed that Darth Vader’s outer helmet is blowing all over the place in this scene from Empire? \nVia \nRelated Video: The most iconic scene from Star Wars recreated with cats 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T03:07:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
