It took away from the glamour of the Oscars.\"\n\"It didn't feel like a very glamorous evening,\" Trump added. \"I've been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.\"\nMuch of the political talk during the Oscars was directed at Trump, criticizing him and his policies. Several different participants in the ceremony attacked Trump for his comments and actions on immigration.\nSunday's Academy Awards had a few problems that gained public notice.\nDuring the show, Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty read out the winner for Best Picture, saying it was La La Land . The actual winner, however, was Moonlight . Confusion ensued as those on stage explained to the audience that La La Land did not actually win.\nThe ceremony also displayed the wrong picture during the \"In Memoriam\" tribute, showing an image of Australian producer Jan Chapman when the tribute was meant for Australian costume designer Janet Patterson.\nThe post Trump: Academy Awards Failed Because of Obsession with Politics appeared first on Washington Free Beacon .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:50:22.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
