It's from Romania and Cuba, from Somalia and Iran. So many of the most revolutionary products, exciting trends, and creative movements in our country's beauty scene have been pioneered by women and men born outside of its borders. This seems like a pretty damn good week to celebrate them. Their numbers are legion, but here are 12 standouts. Anastasia Soare Birth country: Romania Beauty impact: Before Soare, brows were an almost nonexistent category in the beauty business. Anastasia Beverly Hills now has brow salons around the country and a 400-SKU makeup line carried in Sephora, Nordstrom, Macys, and Ulta. Her Dipbrow Pomade and liquid lipsticks are the stuff of legend. Learn more about Soare here .

Courtesy of Hung Vanngo Hung Vanngo Birth country: Vietnam Beauty impact: Glowy, ethereal, sultry, seamless—all adjectives that have been used a million times (give or take) to describe Vanngo’s work. The makeup artist is as known for giving the Selena Gomez ’s and Julianne Moores’ of the world striking red carpet looks as he is for making just about every Victoria’s Secret angel glisten and gleam . Courtesy of Jin Soon Choi Jin Soon Choi Birth country: Korea Beauty impact: Manicurist Choi is a backstage regular who zips through MoMA for inspiration before turning models’ nails into mini works of art . She collaborates with designers like Marc Jacobs, fashion photographers like Steven Meisel, and magazines like Allure . And if you love nail polish, you probably own at least one—or, more likely, 10—shades from her well-edited line, Jin Soon. But before Choi gave us the best pinky-beige around ( Nostalgia ) or owned three Manhattan salons, she came to New York City with $400 in her pocket. Courtesy of Ouidad Ouidad Birth country: Lebanon Beauty impact: The founder of the curly-hair empire Ouidad pioneered the market for curl-specific hair products . She now has three flagship salons, over 1,000 Ouidad-certified stylists around the country, and more than one Best of Beauty Award .

In 1994, long frustrated that no foundation matched her skin tone, she started Iman Cosmetics , a line for women of color.

Her third act: Chantecaille, a makeup, skin care and fragrance line that marries her passions for technology and botanicals—and donates proceeds from many of its products to support endangered species around the world, from honey bees to elephants. Courtesy of Negin Zand Negin Zand Birth country: Iran Beauty impact: Now at Benjamin with Negin Zand salon in Los Angeles, Zand has transformed the hair colors of Cate Blanchett, Scarlett Johansson, and Angelina Jolie and dozens of other A-listers.

Getty Images Oribe Birth country: Cuba Beauty impact: He’s the single-named hairstylist who defined the '90s with a client roster—Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell—right out of a George Michael video.

He’s actually credited Lopez as the inspiration for the much-obsessed-over jasmine-and-sandalwood scent of his products. Oribe’s line has many standouts but his Dry Texturizing Spray has inspired praise from more celebrities, hairstylists, blogger, and fashion designers than we can count.
