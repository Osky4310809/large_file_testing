The decision to implement delayed trading is a direct response to combat problems related to high-frequency trading (HFT). The NYSE’s move is partly intended to comply with regulatory requirements and partly to address issues of exchange competition. \nHFT was most notably described in Michael Lewis’s book, Flash Boys, which tells the story of a $300 million high-speed network designed to reduce the journey time for trading data from Chicago to New Jersey to trade stocks faster than the market. The goal was to exploit time delays in data transmission that gives bank traders access to better prices than their clients, allowing them to earn superior profits.

Flashes of Anger \nAs investors learned of this practice anger grew, and last summer America’s newest stock exchange, the IEX, worked out a deal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that said part of the deal to receive regulatory approval to open for business would require IEX to implement an SEC rule compelling other exchanges to honor trades subject to a small delay in trading, called a “speed bump.” Until recently, other exchanges have been reluctant to follow along. \nThe IEX felt they could win additional business by slowing trading down and preventing banks from exploiting the data time delays described in Flash Boys. At the time, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said in a statement, “Today’s actions [by IEX] promote competition and innovation, which our equity markets depend on to continue to deliver robust, efficient service to both retail and institutional investors.” \nAccording to CNBC, the IEX argued that it wants to use delayed trading to protect investors from potentially harmful trading practices that could allow banks to trade ahead of their clients, potentially defrauding them of entitled profits. Over time, IEX felt they could win business from rival exchanges by building up investor trust in more transparent pricing. The Proof Is In The Pudding \nNow NYSE American is getting on board, and will also slow down trading by a few micro-seconds upon trade order entry to frustrate high-frequency traders. In response to NYSE’s decision to implement similar delayed trading, Tom Farley, NYSE President said, “As US equity markets become increasingly complex … we are committed to providing listed companies, investor and market participants with more choice on how they trade with us …” \nDisclaimer: Gary Ashton is an oil and gas financial consultant who writes for Investopedia.
