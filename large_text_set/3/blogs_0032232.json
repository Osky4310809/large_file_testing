The switch, being done in stages, is an effort by the state to save electricity, reduce emissions and enhance road safety, The Sun reports. \nAccording to state housing, local government and environment committee chairman Datuk Ismail Othman, the replacement work is being carried out by four local authorities, starting with Malacca Historic City Council (MBMB). He added that more than 1,000 LED street lights have already been installed in tourist areas, including Bandar Hilir and Klebang. \nHe said the state was committed to the plan in applying green technology, because it was a state government objective. In 2016, it was reported that the Malacca Road Lighting Project would see the installation of over 100,000 smart LED street lights across the state. \nMalacca’s effort follows on the increasing global trend to switch from HPS to LED street lighting solutions. In the Klang Valley, that switch to LEDs is also being made. Several areas are now running LED lighting, including roads around the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang and some highways. Residential areas are also making the transition – DBKL has begun switching over to LED lighting in places such as Kepong. \nWhile HPS lamps have good efficiency in terms of lumens per watt output, they do not offer good colour rendering with their dull yellow/orange tone light generation. The argument for LEDs is that it offers better colour accuracy in its light, thus improving visibility. Correspondingly, this translates to better road safety. They also save more energy, consuming less wattage per equivalent light output.
