The Ghanian athlete was named “man of the match” after scoring two goals for the South Africa Free State Stars against the Ajax Cape Town in the Premier Soccer League. ADVERTISEMENT However, his post-game interview was marred with hilarity, as the 22-year-old striker committed a classic “slip of the tongue.” “Firstly, I appreciate my fans,” Anas began, “also my wife and my girlfriend.” Upon realizing his mistake, he quickly backtracked his sentiments and let out a nervous chuckle. “I mean my wife, sorry for saying, I’m so sorry, my wife,” he said. “I love you so much. I love you so much from my heart.” Twitter reacts As expected, the internet was unforgiving of his colossal gaffe and immediately roasted him on Twitter.
