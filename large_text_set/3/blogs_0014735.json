And the bakeries have opted for producing other products in order to be able to survive economically.” \nBakeries in the country are already plagued by strict price controls, currency controls and the government monopoly on imported raw materials. \nThree-quarters of Venezuela’s population lost at least 19 pounds amid serious food shortages last year. A 2016 living conditions survey called “Encovi” conducted on 6,500 Venezuelan families found that 32.5 percent eat only once or twice a day. That’s about three times higher than the 11.3 percent answering the same question just a year ago, the survey found. Encovi estimates 82 percent of Venezuelan households live in poverty. \nVenezuela isn’t experiencing a famine , but is living with the consequences of decades of socialist policies. Price controls force businesses to sell food at low prices, encouraging farmers to sell on the black market or outside the country. For example, Venezuela requires cornmeal to sell for about 16 cents a bag, but the same cornmeal can sell for $3 dollars on the black market . \nCash-strapped Venezuela can’t pay for food imports after years of mismanagement, heavy spending on poorly-run government programs, and lack of investment on its oil fields. The government rejected food assistance from Amnesty International and the United Nations. \nMeanwhile, Venezuela’s inflation rate is expected to top 1,640 percent in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund . The country may have the world’s highest murder rate . \nVenezuela also has some of the world’s largest petroleum reserves, but the collapse in crude oil prices is cutting into state coffers. The country can’t afford to pump oil at current prices, and as recently as February was forced to accept shipments of U.S. crude oil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T04:16:42.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
