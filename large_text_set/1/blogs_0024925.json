Regardless of whether you want a big fat Indian wedding, or just a signing at the local magistrate's office, with nobody other than your family and friends around, it is a day that is about the bride and the groom. Or, so weâ€™d like to believe. It seems rational. After all, none of this gala would happen if it wasn't for the two people tying the knot. After this day, everyone will go back to their lives, going about things the way they have been. Everyone, except the bride and the groom. Their lives will never be the same, and so it is only fair that they should not only be the centre of attention, but also in charge of how the wedding goes. But, we all know that it never works out this way. Inevitably, it becomes a family affair, and the two people who are the reason behind the celebrations, are sidelined. Sure, they can decide the general feel and look of their big day, but the actual planning and execution is hardly ever in their hands. This doesn't sit well with some of us. Weddings, by default, come with a whole lot of drama. There are tens of people involved (if not more), too many customs and rituals, and even more opinions on pretty much everything. To be able to reconcile all of this, and bring to life a kickass party is an ordeal! As the bride and groom, many of us focus too much on our wedding day. We want things our way, and not our parents', or friends, or relatives. But, the fact is, it is your family's day just as much as it is yours. Their daughter, son, or sibling is embarking on a new journey, and they have every right to celebrate that the way they want to. A good marriage is also about honouring the families, because that's the difference between dating and being married. The former is about two individuals, while the latter is about two families. At some point, we need to let go of the control, and focus on the lifetime of togetherness that awaits us. Because, that's really what is about us. Wedding and marriage is too different things. Let's not allow confuse the two.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T06:38:06.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
