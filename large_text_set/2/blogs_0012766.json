He started his acting career with the film, Saath Hindustani , and has come a long way in his career. Even today, at the age of 74, he does movies like Pink , that can give any young actor a run for their money. The Deewar actor took to his blog, where he shared several on-set pictures clicked during the shooting of his debut film. His blog reads, \"There is an avalanche of events related to this date, the 15th of February... For on this date in the year of the Lord 1969...Yes that is nineteen sixty nine... I became an official entrant to the film industry, by signing my very first film, Saat Hindustani .\" \nWe are glad that we witnessed this amazing talent in our life time.
