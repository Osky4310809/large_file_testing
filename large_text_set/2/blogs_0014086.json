If you've ever visited the gun range, you know there are an array of targets you can select and purchase while you practice your marksmanship. I have an old Osama bin Laden target riddled with bullet holes on my refrigerator. A few months ago I selected a cartoon scene of a barn with various animals (don't shoot the animals!) for my practice.\nAnd there is the standard silhouette target. It looks like this:\nAccording to the campaign, the black target leads to trigger bias.\nYoung black men are 3X more likely to be shot by trained shooters than their white peers. A disturbing potential correlation: The most popular target for shooters to learn to use their firearm is a black silhouette. Unconscious bias can be deadly.\"\nThere is even an academic study to \"back it up.\"\nAn academic study published by University of Illinois researchers drew together findings from 42 different studies on trigger bias to examine whether race affects how likely a target is to be shot.\n\"What we found is that it does,\" Mekawi told NPR's Arun Rath, who covered the story.\n\"In our study we found two main things: First, people were quicker to shoot black targets with a gun, relative to white targets with a gun. And ... people were more trigger-happy when shooting black targets compared to shooting white targets.\"\nThat is, shooters weren't just faster to fire at black targets; they were also more likely to fire at a black target. This petition seeks to eliminate the use of the most popular target for shooters to learn to use their firearm: a menacing black silhouette.\nThe campaign consists of artists working in various mediums.\nNo More Black Targets is a collective of artists, diverse in backgrounds, ethnicities and nationalities, working in paint, digital media, patternmaking and also physical installations to bring new artwork to life. The collective stand for “More paint. Less hate.”\nSome of those targets are pretty cool -- I'd frame one and hang it on my wall. But as far as using them at the range, I am quicker to shoot at things when I have the most visible color contrast. It would take me longer to figure out exactly where I want to shoot if my target can blend in with its surroundings and I am being timed on my reflexes and accuracy. Does this translate into shooting more black people because people tend to train on black targets? I don't think we have persuasive evidence based on the information I've been able to read about the study, for which I refuse to pay.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/20/new-campaign-seeks-to-end-use-of-black-targets-at-gun-ranges/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.nomoreblacktargets.com/", "http://www.guns.com/2017/02/17/group-wants-to-eliminate-human-black-silhouette-targets-video/", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/02/FirearmTarget-225x300.jpg", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/02/FirearmTarget.jpg", "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2017/02/NMBT.gif"], "published": "2017-02-20T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:03:20.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
