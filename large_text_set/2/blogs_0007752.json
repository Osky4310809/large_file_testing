I am a land based fisherman. I have all the gear for all types of fish that is required for land based fishing.\"\nThe ad resulted in plenty of melted hearts, with the widower scoring himself a heap of free fishing equipment and an even bigger legion of mates who wanted to fish with him.\nMati Batsinilas and his family were lucky enough to be graced with the company of Johnstone, as they took him on their boat for a fishing trip off Stradbroke Island, Queensland on the weekend.\nJohnstone claimed he was \"not as young as he used to be\" as he hopped on the boat, but gave it his all when it came to fishing.\n\"It's been good today. Caught a few whiting, a couple of a little other ones [but] had to chuck them back,\" he told 7 News .\nAnd so they fished, laughed and ate a lot. Batsinilas even joked that Johnstone would leave a few kilograms heavier thanks to his mother's cooking. How good is this story?\nBONUS: This device can make any pair of headphones wireless", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/BCFAustralia/posts/1433134383383949", "https://www.facebook.com/7NewsBrisbane/videos/1412796785399836/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/Vqw2ZFrs.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/Vqw2ZFrs.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154941773897071&set=a.10150622229517071.409025.598297070&type=3"], "published": "2017-02-08T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:13:59.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
