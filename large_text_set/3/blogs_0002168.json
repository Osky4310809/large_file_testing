With Stone Sour, you almost have to work twice as hard because with Slipknot sometimes you can almost let the mask do a lot of the work for ya. \n\"You just stand in this creepy position and creep the hell out of the 14-year-olds on the barricade. But with Stone Sour, I've always tried to create a real juxtaposition with that, where it's like - Slipknot is theatrical and dark, and Stone Sour is much more of a party. It's very - I don't wanna say positive - but it's a much more lighter atmosphere, and you can definitely see my sense of humor a little more.\"The singer added: \"Both are very taxing - I'm not young anymore and it kicks the crap out of me. That's why I try to stay fit, I work out 5 or 6 days a week just to stay fit. I changed my diet, I quit smoking, I don't do drugs all because my career is important to me. It's worth it. The proof's in the pudding when you come see us play - it's on from the second we hit the stage. \n\"So they're both very - I don't wanna say extreme, but they're pretty... you exert a lot of energy, but I get different things out of both.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T13:13:01.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
