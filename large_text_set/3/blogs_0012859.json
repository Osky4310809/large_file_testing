Kim, said in a statement. \nJoon said the decision not to pursue the case took into account “…the high burden of proof, the clarity of existing law, any recent changes in the law, and the particular difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit.” \nThe prosecutor also said the unusual decision to issue the statement was made “…in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and mayoral election.” \nDe Blasio has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying everything was done with the advice of his legal team. \n“From the beginning, it’s been basically a year, I’ve said consistently that we acted appropriately, we acted ethically, we acted lawfully,” de Blasio said earlier on WNYC’s “The Brian Lehrer Show.”“I think this confirms what I’ve been saying and all my colleagues have been saying that we hold ourselves to a high standard and we will continue to.” \nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said a scheme concocted by team de Blasio to help elect Democrats to the State Senate, which circumvented campaign donation limits by funneling large contributions to county committees, violated the spirit of the campaign laws, CBS2’s Marcia Kramer reported. But he got off because of what Vance called “the advice-of-counsel defense.” \nVance said that a person who relies on legal counsel cannot be found to have “willfully” broken the law, Kramer reported. \nDe Blasio said he hadn’t had a chance to analyze Vance’s statement but insisted, “We did everything within the law, everything within clear ethical standards, we sought guidance and clarity. Everything we did not only conformed to the law but went in many cases beyond.” \nVance also said he would not prosecute allegations of election violations in state senate races in 2014 but said it didn’t mean he condoned the behavior. The district attorney asked both the state Board of Elections and the Legislature to change the laws to eliminate any loopholes. \n“This conclusion is not an endorsement of the conduct at issue; indeed, the transactions appear contrary to the intent and spirit of the laws that impose candidate contribution limits, laws which are meant to prevent ‘corruption and the appearance of corruption’ in the campaign financing process,” he wrote in a letter to the state board of elections. \nCity Hall Press Secretary Eric Phillips issued a statement after the ruling saying, “We have been confident from the moment these reviews began that the actions of the mayor and our administration have always been within the law. The United States Attorney and Manhattan District Attorney have now put to rest any suggestion otherwise. We thank these prosecutors’ offices for conducting what were clearly diligent and exhaustive reviews – and for making public the conclusions of these probes. New Yorkers deserve honest, progressive government. With this mayor, they will always get it.” \nThe mayor also added a note of political gratitude. \n“I appreciate that both the U.S. Attorney’s office and the District Attorney’s Office did a very thorough effort,” he added. “We cooperated from the very beginning, we said we wanted to help in any way we can, we could and we did offer a lot of assistance and information and I appreciate that they completed their process and made their findings public especially with an election coming in a matter of months.” \nDe Blasio said both prosecutors “made very clear — unequivocally — that there was no violation of law and now again we have to get back to work.” \n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
