ADVERTISEMENT \n“Our portfolio of innovative medicines, which addresses the unmet medical needs of patients in the Asia-Pacific region drives our strong business growth today,” Zieler said in a press conference on Tuesday. \nAccording to global health intelligence agency IMS 2016 data, Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals business continued to be one of the fastest growing among multinational companies and among the top 10 in value sales in Asia-Pacific in 2016. \nIn 2017, Bayer expects sales of more than €17 billion for its Pharmaceuticals Division, globally corresponding to a mid-single-digit percentage increase on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis. \nCombined sales of key growth products Xarelto, Eylea, Stivarga, Xofigo and Adempas are expected to reach more than €6 billion globally, according to Bayer. Asia-Pacific continues to provide a viable growth opportunity, as IMS predicts an average market growth rate of 5 percent across the region from 2017 to 2020. \n“With our robust performance in Asia-Pacific, we expect the positive development to continue in 2017 as our innovative products continue to serve the growing healthcare needs in the region,” said Zieler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T16:45:16.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
