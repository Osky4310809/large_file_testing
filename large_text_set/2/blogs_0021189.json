The company is expected to unveil them at a March event. \nThe delay in the launch of the two new iPads will impact revenues of Apple’s suppliers TPK Holding and General Interface Solution which supply touch panels to Apple for the tablets. \nVarious rumors and reports have pointed to Apple launching its new iPad Pro 2 lineup in March this year. The company will be unveiling three new iPad Pro models this year, with two of them being an upgrade to its existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models. As for the third 10.5-inch model, it will feature a bezel-less design, more powerful internals, and a screen resolution similar to that of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro . It will reportedly be the new flagship iPad Pro in Apple’s tablet lineup. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 will replace the iPad Air 2 in Apple’s existing tablet lineup which means it should carry a lower price tag than its predecessor when launched. \nThe limited supply of the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro have further fueled rumors of Apple launching its refreshed iPad Pro lineup in March. However, it is uncharacteristic for Apple to announce the tablets in March and then not ship them until May or June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:29:12.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
