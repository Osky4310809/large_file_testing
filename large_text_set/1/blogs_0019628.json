(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP) \nGrammy-winning singer Chrisette Michele resurfaced Tuesday, nearly a week after essentially going off the grid to avoid dealing with the backlash that followed her decision to perform at one of Donald Trump's inaugural balls. \n\"After seeing what happened to Jennifer Holliday, I literally turned my phone off, she told Billboard , \"because I knew if I was going to make any type of decision, I couldn’t be swayed left or right by what anybody thought.\" \nShe missed Twitter calling her a sellout, The Roots' Questlove offering to pay her not to perform and Spike Lee declaring he had reconsidered his plan to license her song Black Girl Magic for his upcoming Netflix adaptation of She's Gotta Have It . (Those last two stung, she admits.) When social media speaks, Hollywood listens ... and acts \nHowever, the gig offered \"an opportunity to get in front of these people who don’t seem to understand who they’re talking to and show them what we look like. I felt automatically committed to making sure that I stood up for the women who’ve felt disrespected and the minorities who felt disrespected, communities that felt that they weren’t being heard or understood. I thought that it was almost my responsibility to not just say yes but to say yes with purpose, so that was my reasoning. And no, I didn’t think twice about it.\" \nAnd she has no regrets — well, except that she didn't even get to meet President Trump. \n\"Originally I was supposed to perform directly after his first speech, and I had done that with Barack Obama before, so I was used to that kind of experience,\" she said, recalling her 2016 state dinner performance for the Obamas and the prime minister of Singapore. \"And the woman who organized the event came and told me, 'Now you’re going to go first and he’s going to go after you.' I looked her in the eye and said, 'My family has disowned me. If you decide to Google me, you’ll see that America is writing about me in their newspapers. I’m the black poster child for discord right now, and he’s not going to shake my hand?' So no, I didn’t get to meet him.\" \nBut she's trying to focus on the upside: She was in the room where it was happening so she worked it, talking to everyone she could. \n\"There were a lot of people who are excited to sit down and talk, who worked on his campaign,\" she said. \nMichele left her phone off all weekend, putting all her thoughts about the election, the inauguration and the backlash against her performance and the polarized state of American politics. That morphed into No Political Genius , a spoken-word album she release Monday. She plans to adapt it into a TV series. \n\"Division isn't smart now,\" she says in the album, referring to the decision by 60-plus Democrats to sit out Trump's swearing-in . \nAs she read the statements coming in from politicians, her reaction was, \"Well if you’re not equipped to handle this situation then who is ?\" she asks. \nInstead of boycotts, she said, \"I think that the most important thing for us to do now is talk to each other and to people who we may have never spoken to and begin to understand each other’s struggle to see what we do have in common so that we can see where we can unite and what we can fight together. ... With No Political Genius , that is my goal -- just to begin the conversation.\" 69 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kq7eMb NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
