Literally! Heritage shatters the backboard against Evans tonight!!!! OH MY WORD pic.twitter.com/w5W4OtH5zC \n— Kevin Faigle (@kevinfaiglewrdw) January 11, 2017 That is Isaiah Banks of Heritage High School with the literal rim-destroying dunk. Sometimes, a backboard will shatter because someone hung on the rim. This wasn’t that. This was a tomahawk dunk so ferocious, the impact with the rim shattered the backboard. It was instant, and extremely impressive. It was also a game-ending dunk, as the game was called in the third quarter because of the damage with Heritage winning, 40-14.\nIt seems Banks has a history of throwing down high-flying dunks.\nHad to write my name on the rim for the one time pic.twitter.com/w2NWbGqv7T \n— THROW THE OOP. (@isaiahbanks_) August 31, 2016 Any high schools left on Heritage’s schedule might want to consider having a backup backboard on hand before this happens.\nSafe to say No. 5 @Patriots_hoops entered Region 3- with a bang tonight. 40-14 shortened win thanks to @isaiahbanks_ pic.twitter.com/26mVUUXKIr \n— Kyle Sandy (@KyleSandy355) January 11, 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:27:26.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
