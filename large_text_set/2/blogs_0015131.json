Mom’s Hilarious “Care Package” Is the Best Response Ever to Son Not Doing His Chores Heather Newman \nFrom washing the dishes to making their beds, getting teens to carry out chores is next to impossible. This struggle was no different for mom Terri Cox of Leonardtown, Maryland. But she decided to teach him a lesson … in the best way possible. \nAccording to BuzzFeed, when her 18-year-old son, Connor, came home for the holidays, they made a verbal agreement that he would carry out all of his normal chores. But did he? Of course not! He headed back to college and left his room filled with garbage. \nTerri certainly wasn’t going to stand for this, telling BuzzFeed, “His room should be left the way it was when he came home for Christmas break, which I cleaned before he came home.” So, she played a trick on him. \nA few weeks ago, Connor received a massive box from Mom after returning to college. He was super excited, telling Babble, “ When I first got the package I was thrilled because my mom usually sends me snacks and stuff, and it was a pretty big box so I was expecting a good amount of food.” \nExcept, it was something entirely different … a big ol’ box of trash! Image source: Connor Cox \nTrash he had accumulated while home for the holidays. Connor tells Babble: “I called her right after I realized what she did, and we shared a laugh. She has always had a great sense of humor and it definitely made sense that she would think of something that clever.” image source: connor cox This is the first time that Terri has played a trick on him, but Connor wasn’t surprised at all. He probably had it coming, as he admitted to BuzzFeed, “Most of the trash was hidden in my clothes drawers.” Oh come on, Connor! You’re better than this. No wonder your mom retaliated in such a way. Connor shared the photo on Twitter , which has since received 1.4K likes, over 300 retweets, and supportive comments about Mom, like, “Terr[i] is iconic.” We totally agree! But Connor had no idea the photo would get so much attention. He told Babble, “ I was really caught off guard by it going viral like this. I think [it’s] pretty cool to get out there and have everyone see how savage my mom is.” We’re definitely taking notes, Terri. You are truly #MomGoals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:39:01.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
