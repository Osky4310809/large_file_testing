To help you, here are a few ways to get the perks of some popular subscription services, like gym memberships and cable, for free. Readers, you nailed the January money challenge. Take a minute to congratulate yourselves, then… Read more Read more Create Your Own Meal Kit \nServices like Blue Apron and HelloFresh are great if you suck at meal planning . They mail you a box of fresh ingredients and recipes and all you have to do is cook the meal. These kits are convenient but they’re also quite expensive, starting at about $60 a week. There are creative ways to get a couple of the same perks these kits offer without emptying your wallet. What to Do When Meal Planning Never Seems to Work for You What to Do When Meal Planning Never Seems to Work for You What to Do When Meal Planning Never Seems to Work… It’s easy enough to set up a meal plan, but maintaining it is a different story. Maybe you don’t… Read more Read more \nMeal kits save you from having to plan your meals but there are some free or cheap apps that can do this for you, too. Advertisement Advertisement \nSimple apps like Pepperplate (free on iOS and Android ) organize your recipes for you, then automatically create grocery lists based on those recipes. Just search for the recipe online, upload it, then go to the grocery store and get what you need. If you want even more convenience, you can skip the recipe search with apps like Cook Smarts and Plan to Eat ( our two reader favorites ). Just like Blue Apron, they plan out your meals and come with step-by-step instructions. Both Cook Smarts and Plan to Eat cost money, though. You’ll pay $6-$8 a month with the former at $5 a month with the latter. They’re not free, but they’re more cost effective than a meal kit. \nOf course, meal kits save you a grocery trip, too, which is another reason they’re so expensive: your ingredients are delivered to your door. You can get around this with grocery delivery services like Instacart or AmazonFresh . Instacart recently integrated with AllRecipes.com so you can add recipes to your cart and the app will automatically compile a grocery list that you can schedule for delivery. Of course, you’ll pay a delivery fee (usually between $4 and $6, plus tip), but you’ll get the same convenience you do with a meal kit. You can also save recipes so you can revisit them. Work out at Free Facilities (or Your Own Home) \nA gym membership is expensive but, provided you actually use it (or it motivates you to work out), they can be worth it. That said, there are free or cheap places to get a workout , too. For example: Sponsored Public gyms : Search your city’s Department of Parks and Recreation for public gyms, fitness centers, or community centers. Some community colleges have cheap or free fitness classes, too. City parks : As our own Stephanie Lee points out , you’ll usually at least find a pull-up bar at a city park, and many of them include other rigs for ab exercises, lunges, dips, or other exercises. Playgrounds : If all else fails, playgrounds are also a great place to workout. You have to get a little creative, but this video shows you how to get a monkey bar workout and this post from Nerd Fitness shows you how to turn a playground into your own personal gym.

They’re solid options if you want to save money on a membership, though. Ditch Cable and Stream for Free \nDitching cable is easier than ever, and while you can buy an HD antenna to get local channels , subscription streaming services cost money. This calculator will help you figure out how much you’ll save, depending on the services you sign up for to replace it . Advertisement Advertisement \nFar be it from me to suggest anyone should cut these paid services (or even cable), but if you want to save cash, there are ways to watch stuff for free , too. You won’t get the latest season of House of Cards, but you can watch old movies and cartoons online. For example: Cartoon Network : You can watch full episodes of shows like Adventure Time, Powerpuff Girls, Pokemon, and more without having to pay or even create an account. Internet Archive Movies : Watch over 4,000 movies listed on Internet Archive, a nonprofit that archives all kinds of content, from photos to books to classic movies like Plan 9 from Outer Space . PopcornFlix : If you’re looking for more current options, PopcornFlix has a pretty wide selection of shows and movies. Top Documentary Films : Watch popular documentaries for free and check out their top 100 documentary list to see what other people are watching. Crackle : They’re hit or miss, but they include episodes of shows like Seinfeld and Married With Children and movies like Being John Malkovich and Desperado. They also have their own original content, like Comedians In Cars, for free. The Best Lesser-Known Services for Legally Streaming Movies and TV The Best Lesser-Known Services for Legally Streaming Movies and TV The Best Lesser-Known Services for Legally… It's easy to forget, but there are a lot more ways to stream movies and TV besides Netflix,… Read more Read more \nIf you have an Amazon Prime subscription, you can get a lot of current movies, shows, and original series for free with Prime Video , too. Every free service has its limitations and they’re certainly not for everyone. That said, if your priority is saving money, it’s possible to still watch shows and movies without even paying for any kind of streaming service. If You Have Amazon Prime, Don’t Pay for Music or Photo Storage \nSpeaking of your Prime subscription, it comes with a handful of other perks you may have forgotten about . And a couple of them could potentially replace services you pay for monthly. \nAmazon Prime Music might replace your Spotify subscription, for example. Spotify is generally free, but if you want the ability to download music and play it offline, the Premium service is $10 a month. You can download and save music offline on Amazon, too, though. Their free collection is limited so you might not find every single artist you’re looking for, but it’s still pretty vast. You can also create playlists and stream stations, artists and songs. The Awesome Amazon Prime Benefits You May Have Forgotten About The Awesome Amazon Prime Benefits You May Have Forgotten About The Awesome Amazon Prime Benefits You May Have… If you shop online, an Amazon Prime membership is easily worth it for the free two-day shipping… Read more Read more \nAmazon Prime also comes with Prime Photos , which offers unlimited, cloud-based photo storage . ( Google Photos comes with unlimited storage for free, too, but it compresses your photos). Amazon’s interface is kind of clunky, but if you’re paying for Dropbox or any other service to store your photos, you can save money and store them for free if you’re an Amazon Prime customer. Read Your Favorite Magazines at Your Local Library \nAnd then there’s the original subscription service: magazines. If you’re on a budget and looking to cut back on your subscription, try public libraries. Many of them use apps like Zinio , which lets library patrons read magazines for free. Advertisement Advertisement \nYou’ll need to create an account and link your library card to that account, but once you do, you have access to digital versions of The New Yorker , Wired , Cosmopolitan , and more. Of course, you can always just visit your local library and see the selection in person. \nIn many cases, your subscription service is worth it. I love Netflix, for example, and gladly pay $7.99 a month for it. When you audit your subscriptions during this month’s challenge , though, consider these options to get some of the same perks for less.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:38:07.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
