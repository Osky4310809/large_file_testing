Source: American Airlines \nThe union says about 10 percent, or 2,300, of the flight attendants it represents have reported adverse reactions—among them skin rashes, sore throats, wheezing, fatigue, and vertigo—since they started wearing the new uniform. “This continues to be a serious and growing problem, and is not going to go away without some further remedial action by the company,” the union said on Thursday in a message to members. \nAmerican says an employee call center it opened in October has gotten 450 formal complaints of health problems, 350 of them from flight attendants. \nThe uniform controversy has become such a topic of concern at the airline that several executives have begun wearing the outfit, or parts of it, in an effort to allay fears. \nStill, the flight attendants believe that chemicals in the uniform—say, a dye or an adhesive—are probably causing the severe reactions the union says are affecting roughly one in 10 flight attendants. \n“I’m very confident that there’s something in that fabric that’s causing this,” said Bob Ross, the union’s national president. “Some [people] react right away. Lots of other people are feeling the effects just by being around the uniforms.” \nRoss, a 33-year American veteran, said he himself wore the new uniform's cotton shirt, “and by the end of the day my entire chest, neck, and arms were red.” It took two showers and disposal of the shirt and its packaging to resolve, he said. \nA New York-based flight attendant, speaking via online chat on condition of anonymity, said her throat had begun burning on one flight and that she had grown hoarse and broken out in hives. She said she had been to 12 doctor appointments in 40 subsequent days for tests and consultations. \nThe uniforms have undergone a battery of tests, and the union, airline, and supplier Twin Hill have all hired experts to determine the chemical composition of the uniforms. \nSo far, testing by American and Twin Hill have not turned up substances that aren't supposed to be in the clothes or any chemical levels exceeding safety limits, the airline has said. \nThe union has hired its own toxicologist to examine the results. It has spent more than $20,000 so far and wants American to reimburse it for its expenses, Ross said. \nLast week, the airline denied a grievance Ross had filed on behalf of sick attendants. “The safety and comfort of our team members is more important than anything we do, and we know it is at the forefront of the APFA’s mission too,” wrote Cindi Simone, American’s managing director of labor relations. \nAmerican has also reimbursed flight attendants who have bought new work clothes similar to the uniform. It says employees may wear their old uniforms, though many no longer have one. \nThe public contretemps has prompted supplier Twin Hill to complain that it is being maligned unfairly. \nIn a Jan. 9 letter to Ross, an executive at the Houston-based supplier, a unit of Tailored Brands Inc., denied any problems with the 1.4 million garments it had provided, citing tests by an independent laboratory it hired. Union officials’ public statements “have been both inaccurate and damaging to Twin Hill’s reputation,” wrote Daryl Stilley, a senior vice president at the company. \nThe company said it plans an all-cotton version of the uniform for those who have had problems with the ones made of wool and polyester—the two main fabrics now being worn. \nRoss responded two days later, writing to Twin Hill that its letter had made him“angry and disheartened” and that the union would not be “bullied” in its efforts to protect flight attendants’ health. \nTwin Hill has also accused the union of canceling an appointment to jointly select uniform pieces from a Twin Hill center in Houston, while American said it was waiting for the union to agree to a date. The union argues that it wouldn't make sense to pick pieces from that facility because they may have been manufactured somewhere other than where those causing problems were created. \nThe union wants to explore the interaction of dozens of chemicals used in the uniforms’ manufacturing, as well as their packaging. \n“Say there’s five different chemicals they test, and they all stay within limits—synergistically, how do they interact?” Ross asked. \nSo far, the problem with the uniforms appears to be concentrated among American Airlines flight attendants. \nThe Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents about 3,300 flight attendants at American’s Envoy regional subsidiary, has received several complaints, but not to the same degree as the APFA, said AFA spokeswoman Taylor Garland. “Clearly, there is a problem with the uniform rollout at American that requires immediate alternative uniform standards and an overhaul of the uniform rollout,” the union said in an e-mail. \nAmerican’s 15,000 pilots have not reported widespread problems with their new wool uniforms from Twin Hill, said Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association.
