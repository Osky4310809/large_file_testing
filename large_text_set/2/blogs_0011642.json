Johanna can't even be in the same room as her husband Scott due to her allergies (Photo: Gofundme) \nBut he revealed that when Johanna entered her new home for the first time she passed out. \n\"The smell of her space triggered her and she lost consciousness. \n\"This was not the picture perfect moment (despite the TV cameras outside) we were waiting for. This was life or death,\" said Scott. Scott spent a year renovating a 'safe house' for Johanna (Photo: GoFundMe) \nJohanna regained consciousness shortly after and was bathed by her two brothers, the only people to whom she is not allergic. \nThe couple are now hopeful she will get accustomed to her new environment. \nScott, a school teacher, installed new paint, floors and furniture - all of it heated to kill any scents. \nJohanna's bedroom is pressurised, like a passenger jet. \nIt uses a homemade, positive-pressure system that aims to keep her air scent-free and allergen-free. \nIn their old home, Johanna lived in an attic room at her friend's home, which has sealed doors and windows and an air purification system. \nShe only left this room to go to hospital or see a doctor. Johanna reacts severely to scents most people can't even detect (Photo: YouTube/Johanna Watkins) \nBut Johanna's life wasn't always like this. Before she married Scott only three years ago, she was able to spend time hiking outside. \nScott said he occasionally noticed that his wife would cough if they were face-to-face - but there were few signs of how bad she would get. \nJohanna's condition deteriorated rapidly. \nShe could react to someone cutting an onion in the kitchen, despite her being three floors above. \nIt was only last year when the couple realised they couldn't live together without endangering Johanna's life. \nDespite this, her committed husband returns home and cooks her dinner every night. Dedicated Scott cooks dinner for his wife every night (Photo: Facebook) \nShe is only allowed to eat two dishes - beef stew and organic lamb. \nAnything else might set off her illness. \n\"There is no easy way around this problem, I want to keep Johanna safe and me going to see her compromises her safety,\" Scott told the BBC . \n\"We are absolutely committed to each other and we're going to wait as long as it takes to see if there is some type of healing,\" he added. \nMCAS is currently untreatable and comes with a number of unpleasant symptoms including coughing, cramping, nausea and the sense of feeling cold all the time. \nSudden attacks can be triggered by stress, food, smells or even a slight change in temperature. Johanna had lived a normal life until only three years ago (Photo: Gofundme) \nTeenager reveals painful allergic reaction to routine hair dye patch test which 'saved her life' \nThe condition has led Johanna to have reactions to everyday things, such as someone smoking \"down the block\" or pizza being cooked a mile away. \nOn a dedicated GoFundMe page, Scott writes: \"There is no known cure for this disease, and its treatment is a complicated puzzle.\" \nFor now, Johanna is only able to see her siblings, who have become her carers and her only link with the outside world. \nHowever, even they have caused her to have minor reactions - despite wearing protective gear around her. \nThe young woman knows her situation is dire, but she still has hope. \n\"I have many gifts in my life that I have to be thankful for\" she said.
