PA:Press Association England will be taking part in the new UEFA Nations League format \nSunSport gives you the lowdown on the new tournament and answer all your questions. What is the UEFA Nations League? \nNational sides across Europe will compete in the new league format that will culminate in a Final Four showpiece event in 2019 for the title of Nations League champion. \nThe aim is to improve the quality of international football and reduce the number of meaningless friendlies as UEFA bid to re-ignite interest in the international game. \nThey believe more matches across Europe will be more competitive, leading to more interest from supporters who have become bored with international friendlies. How will the UEFA Nations League work? \nOrganisers will use the UEFA ranking system to determine the make-up of four leagues (A,B,C and D) from the 55 teams involved. \nTheir ranking as of November 2017, at the end of the qualifying campaign for the 2018 World Cup, will be used to split the nations into their respective leagues. \nEach league will then be split again into smaller groups of three or four teams who will play each other – with four teams promoted and four teams relegated in each cycle (every two years). PA:Press Association Wales will be ranked well in the new UEFA Nations League based on their current ranking \nThe winners of the four groups in League A will qualify for the Final Four competition. When will the Nations League be played? \nThe competition will take place over six matchdays – double-headers during the international breaks already on the football calendar in September, October and November 2018. \nHow teams perform in the Nations League will be used to determine which pots they will be placed in for future European qualifiers for the Euros and the World Cup. Uefa The format for the UEFA Nations League What is the Final Four? \nThe Final Four will be a showpiece summer event to climax the Nations League. \nThe winners of the four groups in League A will play each other in a one-leg semi-final in June 2019, with the winners going forward to contest the final. \nThe winner of the final will be crowned Nations League champions.
