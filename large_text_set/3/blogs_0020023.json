It's a direct sponsorship,\" he said. \nGreens senator Nick McKim said regardless of whether the report was true or not, the government should always prioritise on the basis of need. \n\"The idea that we would prioritise on religion as opposed to genuine need is quite disgusting. It's racial profiling or religious profiling,\" he said. \nShadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus said Australia had never selected immigrants based on religion and he would be disturbed if the country started to do so. \nMore Muslims had been killed in the conflict in the Middle East than members of any other religion, Mr Dreyfus said. \n\"This is a sectarian conflict as much as it is anything else,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \n\"Of course, Christians are persecuted in the Middle East and of course Muslims are being persecuted in the Middle East, and members of other religions as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:30:15.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
