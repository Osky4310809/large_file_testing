The 26-year-old actress is planning legal action over stolen photographs that are making their way around the internet, her rep tells ET. NEWS: Amanda Seyfried Demands Website Take Down Leaked Nude Private Photos \"Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen,\" the rep said in a statement. \"They are not nude photographs. Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting further.\" The release of the stolen photos follows recent controversy surrounding Watson's role as a feminist after she displayed her cleavage in a recent spread for Vanity Fair. \"Feminism is about giving women choice. Feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with. It's about freedom, it's about liberation, it's about equality. I really don't know what my t*ts have to do with it. It's very confusing,\" she told Reuters in response to the backlash. \"I'm confused,\" she continued. \"Most people are confused. No, I'm just always just quietly stunned.\" RELATED: Ricky Gervais, Emma Watson, Anna Kendrick and More Tweet About Nude Photo Hack A hacker previously threatened to leak nude images of Watson in 2014, after her powerful speech on gender equality at the UN, though photos were never released. \"I knew it was a hoax. I knew the pictures didn't exist,\" she later said at a Facebook event in 2015. \"The minute I stepped up and talked about women's rights, I was immediately threatened. Within less than 12 hours, I was receiving threats.\" See the speech that started it all below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T00:35:01.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
