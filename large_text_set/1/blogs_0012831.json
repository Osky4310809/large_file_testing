For legitimate political differences or the fear of associating with such a toxic brand, the Trump team's invitation been turned down by...pretty much everyone, most recently Moby who responded, simply, with laughter . \nToday, though, they've announced the lineup for a concert they're calling the \"Make America Great Again!' Welcome Celebration,\" which'll go down on Thursday January 19, the day before the inauguration proper, and will feature the likes of post-grunge lightweights 3 Doors Down and country superstar Toby Keith. Per 3 Doors Down's Instagram, they also somehow managed to snag a selector for the proceedings: the legendary DJ Ravidrums . Who is DJ Ravidrums you may ask? Well if you're not familiar with the occasional reality TV contestant and one-time musical director for the entirely forgotten NBC show Howie Do It who claims on his website to have invented the \"live re-mix,\" may I direct you to the below video, taken from Nintendo's 2008 presentation at E3.
