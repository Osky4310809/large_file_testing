It also estimates that health insurance premiums for people buying individual non-group coverage would go up by about 50 percent in a decade, further complicating GOP promises that people will not lose coverage under their plan.\nThe report comes as Republican leaders in Washington are working furiously to tamp down concerns within their ranks that a speedy push to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act could create chaos in the insurance markets and provoke backlash from voters. Last weekend, President-elect Donald Trump promised in an interview with The Washington Post that he was nearing completion of a plan to provide \"insurance for everybody.\" Trump did not provide any details of what that plan would include.\nTrump vows 'insurance for everybody' in Obamacare replacement plan\nThe new report sparked bickering among lawmakers Tuesday as Republicans dismissed the report, arguing that the forthcoming GOP repeal plan will also include some elements of replacement.\n\"This projection is meaningless, as it takes into account no measures to replace the law nor actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual market that has been decimated by Obamacare,\" said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\nTrump vows 'insurance for everybody,' but declines to reveal specifics Robert Costa President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama 's signature health care law with the goal of \"insurance for everybody,\" while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices...\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama 's signature health care law with the goal of \"insurance for everybody,\" while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices...\n(Robert Costa) Senate Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., requested the report to provide an updated estimate of the impact of a 2015 repeal measure that ended in a veto from President Barack Obama. Republican leaders have said that they plan to closely model an upcoming repeal measure on that 2015 legislation and conservative groups have openly touted that bill as a \"dress rehearsal.\"\n\"Nonpartisan statistics don't lie: it's crystal clear that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act will increase health care costs for millions of Americans and kick millions more off of their health insurance,\" Schumer said in a statement.\"\nSanders, Democrats rally thousands across the country to save Obamacare David Weigel Democrats and labor organizers spent Sunday at dozens of rallies across the country, pledging to fight in Congress against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and any attempt to change Medicare or Medicaid.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., the third ranking Republican in the House, responded Tuesday by dismissing the report on Twitter.\n\"The CBO report assumes no Obamacare replacement. In reality, we will provide people with coverage that they want and can actually use,\" he posted.\nCongress took its first step toward rolling back Obama's health-care reform law Friday when House voting along party lines to pass a budget measure that paves the way for a repeal vote in the coming months. Committees in the House and Senate are set to begin writing legislation that will roll back major elements of the health care law, including penalties for those who don't get insurance and credits that help people buy insurance on the private market.\nRepublicans are now facing the far more difficult difficult task of assembling a viable replacement for a law that has expanded health insurance coverage to roughly 20 million Americans and eliminated unpopular insurance industry practices, such as lifetime coverage caps and widespread refusal to cover already-sick individuals.\nThe Washington Post's Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.\n Health Insurance", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-587bee66/turbine/ct-bernie-sanders-michigan-healthcare-rally-20170115", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-587c242f/turbine/ct-trump-obamacare-replacement-plan-20170115", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-587e5c3a/turbine/ct-cbo-report-gop-health-care-overhaul-20170117"], "published": "2017-01-18T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:22:54.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
