Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated February 2, 2017 - 1:47pm Feng shui master and leading geomancer Aldric Dalumpines Philstar.com/Deni Rose M. Afinidad-Bernardo \nMANILA, Philippines — Have you done everything but you are still not lucky enough? \nMaybe, it is because of the number of letters in your name, feng shui master Aldric Dalumpines recently said at a news conference con for mobile app Shopee. \nTo improve one’s luck this Year of the Fire Rooster, Dalumpines shared some tips on how to know the feng shui meanings of the digits that correspond with one’s name, byline, pseudonym, blog name, mobile number, plate number, address, business name, wedding date, and other important personal data. \nDalumpines shared that \"luck\" came from the word \"Lokia,\" reportedly a place in Sicily believed to be the first tax-free haven in the world. Thus, names then used to be derived from Lokia. These include Luke, which means \"lucky\" or \"to live in Lokia,\" since it was considered lucky to be from that place. \nEverything in the universe, said the geomancer, has been ordered according to numbers. Even all of our days are literally numbered, he said. Manipulating the numbers within our control, according to him, could help us have a better year ahead. \nThe following is his step-by-step guide to know how lucky your personal information is in feng shui. Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: Count the number of letters in your full name, nick name, or business name, excluding punctuation marks. If the total of the numbers in your name is, for example, 21, read it from left to right since the Chinese, from which feng shui came from, does it as such. Hence, your name’s meaning lies in the numbers 1 and 2, for example. Here are the corresponding feng shui meanings of each number: \nThe numbers zero to nine, said Dalumpines, are the core the universe' arithmetic. \n0 – means “money”. Water symbolizes money, he said, which is why hotels and restaurants always have fountains and other water feature. \n1 – Sure good luck \n2 – Easy prosperity \n3 – Forever \n4 – means “death”, which is why there is no fourth floor in Asian countries, just as the West dreads the 13th floor. Thirteen, actually, is very lucky in Chinese as it means “forever sure good luck” (see numbers 1 and 3) \n5 – stands for a progressive pronoun like “me” \n6 – means “on the road to” \n7 – used to be a lucky number that means “forever”, which is why it was the favorite number of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, said Dalumpines. \n8 – since it is composed of two zeroes, it stands for “double money” or “double prosperity” \n9 – means “on the way to getting doubled” or “doubling” \nSo, if your reading is, say, 1 and 2, then that means “sure good luck, easy prosperity.” \nFor your numbers, such as mobile or phone number, no need to count the sum. Just interpret the last two digits. \nIf, however, your result yielded an unlucky meaning, such as “on the road to death” represented by 6 and 4 respectively, then Dalumpines offered the following “cures”: Add or subtract your middle initial or letters in your name or business name to make it luckier. For instance, make it Phillip instead of Philip. Put a 168 sticker, which sometimes come as Chinese characters and can be bought at feng shui shops, into your phone, your phone’s battery pack or plate number if these are deemed unlucky, that is, if your phone number ends in 4 or 7 or if your plate number has any of these numbers. \nThe number “168”, says Dalumpines, means “to be rich forever”, which is why it has been printed in Chinese shopping bags and has been a popular Chinese business name. For him, however, 128 is luckier as two stands for “easy prosperity”, as opposed to six, which means “on the road to”. \nSkeptics, however, dismiss feng shui as a form of superstition with no scientific basis.
