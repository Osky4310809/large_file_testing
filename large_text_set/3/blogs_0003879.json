Google acknowledged the issue and made sure to include Microsoft Exchange in the list of email services it supports.\nWell, today, Google is further integrating Microsoft Exchange’s features into its Gmail platform. Your Gmail can now sync your Exchange tasks so that you can view everything you need to do in one place. There, you can swipe to complete a task, edit its date or priority, create one, or even flag an email as a to-do for later. According to Google, this productivity boost can be a familiar way to integrate work and personal businesses into one app:\nSince the Gmail app interface is both intuitive and familiar, Android users who want to manage their tasks from Exchange won’t need to re-learn anything. With a unified tasks list, we’ve made it easy for you to focus on your important tasks and check things off the list once you’re done. The simple swipe to mark as complete can be just as rewarding.\nDo you use Exchange tasks often? Will this Gmail integration be useful for you?
