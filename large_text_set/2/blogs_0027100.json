By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 28, 2017 9:08 PM Three-time Nizamabad MLA Alam Badi. ( Facebook/Subhash Chandra Singh) \nIn a place like Uttar Pradesh, where politics is dominated by money and muscle power, it’s almost impossible to imagine a candidate contesting, and moreover winning elections with less than Rs 10,000 in his account. But would you believe that there actually exists an MLA, that too in Uttar Pradesh, who travels by Roadways buses, sweeps his entire house with hands, wears clothes made of cheapest fabric, and doesn’t even own a car. We are talking about three-time Nizamabad MLA Alam Badi, who is contesting for his fourth term from the same constituency. Aaj Tak reports that Badi was offered a ministerial birth by Akhilesh Yadav government in 2012, but he refused to take it, and as he wanted to work for people only. \nThe 82-year-old lawmaker from SP only Rs 9 thousand in his bank account when he contested the last 2012 Assembly elections. The MLA owns a very cheap mobile handset available at a cost of around Rs 1000, in market. \nElection Campaign in Rs 2 lakhs \nAlam Badi says that his election campaign has only costed him Rs 2 lakhs so far. He adds that some more expenditure may be incurred in upcoming days. Badi’s last election was also fought on a very low budget. \n9-5 Public service \nBadi, who doesn’t have any other business than public service, spends 8 hours daily among the people of his constituency. He says that when he spends his daily 9 am-5 pm time among the people, there’s no need to do special campaigning at the time of elections. Interestingly, when he lost elections once, he continued his practice and once again went to people the next day. \nAlam Badi’s family \nUnlike other politicians, who ostensibly own mammoth properties in name of their relatives, Badi’s is a different story. The politician is father to six sons. Three of Badi’s sons work out of town for jobs. While one of the six brothers own a small furniture shop, and other one works in a private firm earning Rs 15,000 a month. One of his sons works with him as his PA, however, no one can questions upon his sons honesty \nRefused Ministerial Birth \nAaj Tak reports that Badi was offered a ministerial birth by Akhilesh Yadav government in 2012, but he refused to take it, and as he wanted to work for people only.
