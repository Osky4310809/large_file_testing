But, as SURFER points out , McNamara’s own 2013 wave at Nazaré could break it any day now. \nPlus, not to mention all the entries we saw from earlier this month on one of the biggest swells to hit Nazaré. \nIt’s certainly a validation for McNamara, as he admitted : “Since that time, the Guinness World Records title acts as a kind of ‘seal of legitimacy’ — it makes me very proud and humble all at once.” \nRELATED: Surfers charge massive waves as big-wave spot Nazaré lights up \nWe wouldn’t be surprised to see him eventually beat his own record, or someone from this year (or recent years) taking the title away from him in the near future. But it might take some time (like this official ruling did), as the waves at Nazaré are not the easiest to judge in size since they don’t break top-to-bottom like most other waves.
