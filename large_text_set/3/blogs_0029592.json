Trent Rosecrans of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports on Twitter . It’s not yet clear what the corresponding 40-man roster move will be. \nGennett, 26, agreed to a $2.525MM contract over the winter to avoid arbitration; that’ll now be the responsibility of his new club. He comes with two more seasons of arb control and also remains optionable. \nMilwaukee had utilized Gennett quite frequently over the preceding four seasons, during which he carried a .279/.318/.420 batting line over 1,637 plate appearances. That’s roughly league-average production, though the vast bulk of his time — and his productivity — came against right-handed pitching. Gennett has hit just .187/.237/.254 against southpaws, greatly reducing his function. \nWhile it seems there’s still hope that Gennett can expand his repertoire by learning to move around the diamond, he evidently hadn’t done enough to convince Milwaukee to keep him on the 40-man roster. The club is set to turn over second base to Jonathan Villar , which left Gennett without an obvious role. \nThe path to playing time isn’t really much more clear in Cincinnati, where the starting jobs are all accounted for. But Gennett could spell righty-hitting infielders Jose Peraza and Eugenio Suarez while perhaps also appearing in the corner outfield at times. Plus, if the organization finds a taker for Zack Cozart , or an injury occurs, it’s possible that Gennett could end up receiving an expanded opportunity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:45:18.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
