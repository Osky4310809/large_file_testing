Feb 6, 2017 8:58 AM \nYou go Pop. Anyone that gives this a thumbs down is a complete Blithering idiot Feb 6, 2017 8:58 AM \nI just want to thank all the haters. You made this win much more satisfying. redlikethepig says: Feb 6, 2017 9:00 AM \nYou can’t help but feel sorry for Brady. His life is a constant struggle. I don’t know where he finds the courage to go on. Feb 6, 2017 9:00 AM \nThe drive for five is now complete, on to six… Feb 6, 2017 9:02 AM \nHopes and prayers for Mrs. Brady. Thats a tougher fight than Tom faced this year. weepingjebus says: Feb 6, 2017 9:05 AM \nAs I’ve said, the longer you wait to kiss the rings, the more there will be. Goodell should also bring a shine box. Feb 6, 2017 9:05 AM \nTo all the haters you can kiss our rings gizzmonic says: Feb 6, 2017 9:06 AM \nwho will play evil Goodell in the made for TV remake of this game? Billy Bob Thortan? shadywarrior says: Feb 6, 2017 9:08 AM \nReally happy for the Brady family. Tom’s name has been unjustly dragged through the mud for two years, been railroaded in maybe the greatest sports-related injustice in history, silently is dealing with his mother going through chemo and radiation, who must be sick at what’s being said about her son who just seems like a genuinely good guy with a completely fabricated reputation of ego and superiority, and this guy has taken the high road the whole way, all class. This guy is just an exemplary human being, and I couldn’t be prouder to have him represent my hometown that I love so dearly. Absolutely love this guy. deneb1973 says: Feb 6, 2017 9:09 AM \nLove him or hate him – he dedicated the game to his ailing mother – BEFORE the game. He never gave up; neither has she. Want to hate his mother for instilling that determination in her son? ikeclanton says: Feb 6, 2017 9:12 AM \nWe all knew Deflategate was a manufactured sham once all the layers were peeled back from it. Letting the lecherous and completely untrustworthy NFL have your personal phone against all intelligent advice would have been a mistake and set a horrible precedent. They would have leaked all personal information to the press, and would have found nothing about deflating footballs at all. \nBrady played that one right, even if the conspiracy nutjobs read into it too much. Whatever. Enjoy your collective misery today! maust1013 says: Feb 6, 2017 9:14 AM \n“It meant that all of these people that questioned his authenticity are non-entities from this point on.” \nThey have been right along. The only real difference after last night is now even they know it too. 250dollarnflowner says: Feb 6, 2017 9:15 AM \nyou people make Brady out to be a persecuted person like Nelson Mandela or something. My God, he got a 4 game suspension from the NFL! No one outside of Boston cares. Get over it!!!
