We will vaccinate as many as possible to ensure that the virus cannot circulate in any given community.’’ \nThe polio virus, which invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours, spreads rapidly among children, especially in unsanitary conditions in war-torn regions, refugee camps and areas where health care is limited. \nHealth experts estimate that for every case of polio that paralyses its victim, 200 silent infections go undetected. \nSome 190,000 polio vaccinators will travel house-to-house in villages, towns and cities across the 13 countries, carrying the polio vaccines in ice-filled bags to ensure they do not spoil. \nThe vaccination teams will reach children on the move by targeting bus and train stations, toll plazas and country borders, said Rotary International, which is part of the GPEI. \nTown criers, local guides, community leaders and radio stations have been engaged to spread the word about the campaign and educate people about its importance, according to Carol Pandak, director of Rotary International’s polio program. \n“Through our successes in countries like India we have learned valuable lessons about how to minimise the risk of missing children,’’ said Pandak, who described the polio outbreak in Nigeria as a regional public health emergency. \nThe GPEI, launched in 1988, originally aimed to end all polio transmission by 2000. \nWhile there has been a 99.9 per cent reduction in cases worldwide since the GPEI launch, fighting the last 0.1 per cent of polio has been far tougher than expected. \nIn Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last two countries where polio remains endemic, 33 cases were reported in 2016. \nBefore these latest infections, Nigeria’s last case was in July 2014.
