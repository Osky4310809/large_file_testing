The group filmed their episodes in Japan while they were there for their tour.   \nMBC Music has since released three teasers for the show, which are creating anticipation for the group’s second season of “One Fine Day.” \nThe first teaser shows the members playfully rolling around in the snow, very clearly enjoying filming for the program. The second teaser shows Mingyu and Jeonghan re-enacting common scenes from daytime K-dramas and not being able to hold back their laughter. The final teaser shows the members re-enacting a period drama in which Wonwoo is king. \nThe show will begin airing on March 31 at 7 p.m. KST on MBC Music and MBC every1. \nMeanwhile, while they were in Japan, the members of SEVENTEEN became the first Korean celebrities to ever be featured on Instagram’s official Instagram account. \nCheck out the previews for “SEVENTEEN’s One Fine Day in Japan” below! 어멋날 최초 두번째 여행! 세븐틴이 눈밭에서 노는 방법☃️ \n— 세븐틴의 어느 멋진 날in JAPAN (@mbcmusic_13boys) March 17, 2017 티저#2 민규&정한의 치명적인 아침드라마! 세상에 이런 막장 전개는 없었다 \n— 세븐틴의 어느 멋진 날in JAPAN (@mbcmusic_13boys) March 20, 2017 티저#3 세븐틴의 대하 사극<어느 멋진 날이로다> 역사에 이런 리얼리티는 없었다", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T04:43:30.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
