SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \nT he former Democratic presidential candidate was succinct in her reply, choosing not to use caps, or indeed letters. \"3-0,\" she tweeted, an apparent reference the 3-0 vote by the court. \nMrs Clinton's response split opinion on Twitter. While some praised her, others pointed to her two presidential campaign defeats. â€” Metal Mofosâ„¢ (@MetalMofos) February 10, 2017 . @HillaryClinton You're 0-2 in presidential runs. ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜‚ â€” Asa J ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@asamjulian) February 10, 2017 \nOther social media users weighed in on Mr Trump's response, especially his use of capital letters. Question: if it's true that Trump dictates his tweets, how does one specify ALL CAPS? Or is it an accurate representation of him yelling? â€” Sally Ann Kay (@mcsharhead) February 10, 2017 Now, this is a tweet. Trump take note: She did it with only 3 characters & no exclamation points or CAPS needed. https://t.co/jn3rCrH1AS â€” CIA Spy Girl (@CIAspygirl) February 10, 2017 THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S LEGAL BRIEF SHOULD USE ALL CAPS AND EXCLAMATION POINTS TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! â€” Josh Greenman (@joshgreenman) February 10, 2017 Trump's Tweet shrewdly reflects little known Marbury v. Madison footnote: 'We take notice that ALL CAPS greatly strengthens any argument.\" â€” Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) February 10, 2017 \nT he president's vow to \"see you in court\" after losing a court case also proved as talking point, with the American Civil Liberties Union quick to say they'd be happy to see him there.
