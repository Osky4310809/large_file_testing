The worst demons of the Trump Team has been exorcized and neutralized. Sweden Has Another Problem - It's Collecting Too Much Tax Feb 23, 2017 12:30 PM 0 \nHere’s the peculiar result: The Swedish Government Complains it Collects Too Much Tax . \nData released on Wednesday showed Sweden’s government generated a budget surplus of SKr85bn ($9.5bn) in 2016, with approximately SKr40bn coming from tax overpayments. The government will have to repay more than £3.5bn to businesses and individuals who purposely paid too much tax in 2016. \nThe government wants to discourage further overpayments but the national debt office has admitted its efforts will probably not be enough. \n\nWhile bank interest rates plummeted, Swedish tax rules meant that excess deposits in taxpayers’ payment accounts continued to earn a minimum of 0.56 percent annual interest, leading many people to use them like makeshift bank accounts. \n\nMost governments would be pleased with an annual budget surplus more than twice the forecast size. But Stockholm has complained that this “involuntary borrowing” from residents will cost it around SKr800m more over 2016 and 2017 than if they had borrowed the money at market rates. \n\nUnfortunately for the debt office, there is little chance that the problem will go away anytime soon. At its latest policy meeting last week the central bank said it was more likely to cut rates further into negative territory than increase them in the short term. \nGiven negative interest rates, even if Sweden paid zero percent on overpayments, the Swedish government would lose money vs. borrowing from the central bank. \nI suppose the government could charge money for excess payments, but officials might be worried about voter backlash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:00:34.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
