When Bret Baier asked Sitrewalt to respond to this, he critiqued Spicer for devoting the conference to his “ego” and “swinging haymakers” instead of talking about policy matters. \nCharles Krauthammer followed up with similar commentary, saying it was “surreal” to see the Trump Administration maintaining it’s “obsession” with ratings . While Mollie Hemingway warned that the press can’t overreact to every single development from the Trump team, Stirewalt argued that summoning the press for the purpose of dressing them down is “not how you start.” \n“A president who says we’re going to work day one. We are starting with the business of the people on day one, does not go to Langley and then, standing in front of those stars, complaining about the coverage of his crowd size. that’s thinking about yourself, that’s thinking about your inauguration, that’s thinking about your ratings.” \nStirewalt’s last point was in reference to how Trump attacked the media on his own today while he was meeting with CIA operatives. \nWatch above, via Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T03:35:52.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
