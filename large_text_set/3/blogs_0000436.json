The voices of millions of votes have been muzzled.\" \nMr Fillon said he would respect the summons and tell the judge the truth. \nIn a combative speech, the Republican candidate vowed not to give in but to fight to the end, urging voters to follow him. Who is Francois Fillon? \nA former prime minister during Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, he was selected late last year in national primaries held by the centre-right Republicans that attracted some four million voters. \nFor a time he was the favourite in the race to succeed Francois Hollande as president, but then came the \"fake jobs\" allegations in satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine. \nHe has slipped to third in the polls, behind far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron. \nHis appearances have recently been accompanied by loud protests and he has accused the government of allowing the campaign to turn into \"a climate of quasi civil war\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:02:13.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
