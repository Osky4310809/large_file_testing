Retired @usairforce MWD Bodza (L068) passed away with his dad Kyle by his side on February 21st. Rest easy and run free. pic.twitter.com/E61sVNpekT \nBodza, who spent eight years as a bomb-sniffing dog for the Air Force, was first paired with Smith during a tour of duty in Kyrgyzstan. Smith later adopted the dog when Bodza was retired from the military in 2014.

With fellow service members helping him, Smith placed Bodza on blankets on the floor. \n“I just kept holding him, rubbing and kissing his head, telling him, ‘I’m going to miss you.'” Advertisement - story continues below \nThe time came for the drugs to allow Bodza to drift off forever. \n“I held him in my arms the entire time,” said Smith. “I’ve never cried that much my entire life.” \n“There was heartache and peace all at once that came over me,” Smith said later. “I will never forget how loyal he was … He was selfless — more than any human I’ve ever known. He’s done so much for next to nothing and did it with a smile. I miss him every day.” \nWhen Smith’s superiors learned about Bodza, they wanted to show their respect.

Find it for me now.'” Smith said. \nThey draped the flag over Bodza’s body, in recognition for his service to the country. \n“The worst thing you can do is not to recognize these dogs for what they are,” Smith explained. “For these guys to do this for a dog they’ve never even met.” \nSmith recalled the day he adopted Bodza in 2014. \n“My boss said, ‘Hey, go check your Jeep,'” Smith said. “They went out and put a bowl, a brand new leash and two collars, and they put (Bodza) at the back of my Jeep. I got to take him home the same day he retired.” \n“My favorite thing about him was he didn’t care what you were doing, he just wanted to be there doing it with you,” he said. “Pretty much my whole career with him was walking around something, or walking to somewhere.” \n“He was even more loyal at home,” Smith said. “He followed me around everywhere. He would lay his head down flush with the bed and tell me goodnight, every night.” \n“All of us have that dog that is so special to us,” Smith said. “I got married with this dog, I got divorced with this dog. I have a son on the way, and the most heartbreaking part is I really wish he was younger, so my son would be able to play with him. He was the nicest dog in the world.” What do you think?
