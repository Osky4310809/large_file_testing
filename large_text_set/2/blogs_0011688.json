When you find a bottle that ticks all the boxes, it's important to take some extra steps to ensure your wine tastes as great as possible.\nThere are tons of products that can improve your glass of wine, and we've written about a lot of them. But if you're looking for one item to add to your kitchen, Corkcicle 's 4-in-1 tool might be it.\nThe tool's sophisticated design makes it incredibly easy to prepare your wine for optimal drinking conditions. And u sing it is easy — all you have to do is uncork your bottle and stick it inside.\nAerating your wine is an important step to bring out all the flavors and nuances of your special blend, and Corkcicle's tool features a small side valve that will add just the right amount of oxygen to your wine. Nobody wants to drink room temperature wine, which is why the stainless steel shaft is full of freezing gel that can chill white wine for up to an hour and cool down red blends in 15 minutes — just make sure you throw it in the freezer when idle.\nInstead of removing it every time you want to refill your glass, the Corkcicle One model has a pour spout that doubles as a bottle stopper so it'll stay put as you enjoy your bottle. Or if you like the look of a corked bottle, the Corkcicle Air option features a discreet pourer inside its cork stopper. Both models have the same perks, it just comes down which design you like better.\nMost quality aerators, pourers, stoppers, and chillers can get expensive, especially when you purchase them separately. Available for under $50 each, each Corkcicle tool is a great way to save money, time, and space in your kitchen drawers. Whether you prefer red, white, or rosé, it's a small investment that will pay for itself in no time.\nCorkcicle One 4-in-1 Chiller, Aerator, Pourer, Stopper, $39.95, available at Amazon\nCorkcicle Air 4-in-1 Chiller, Aerator, Pourer, Stopper, $23.99, available at Amazon\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
