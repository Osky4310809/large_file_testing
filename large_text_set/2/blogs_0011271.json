Stop texting me you worthless piece of shit. \n\"You never do anything right. I can't be bothered texting you.\" \nIn another he said: \"I have to hit you repeatedly in the head while screaming at you.\" \nOn the day before she was killed, Miss Bi, who weighed 7st 9lb, arrived back in Cardiff from a trip to London at around midnight and was picked up by Matthews. \nThey went for something to eat before returning home, where a neighbour was woken at 1am by the sound of a male voice shouting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:20:32.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
