Which is not surprising given the key words involved: \"Thomas Keller\" (people like Thomas Keller!) and \"roast chicken\" (literally everybody likes roast chicken!).\nRelated How to Live Your Best Roast-Chicken Life View article Just how popular, though? The recipe's ranked four out of four forks by over 700 Epi readers who have made it at home—and 94 percent say they'd make it again. The last person to add a review , in late January, offered a typical rave: \"This is the BEST and SIMPLEST ROASTED CHICKEN RECIPE EVER!\"\nWell, then. What makes this bird so good? What, indeed, makes a roast chicken the best? I'd say it's a combination of crisp skin and moist, tender meat. (There's also the matter of where the chicken comes from—but that's in your hands.) Let's break down everything Keller tells us to do to get perfect roast chicken every time.\nKeep it simple There are as many tricks to making great roast chicken out there as there are roast chicken recipes—which is to say, a lot. Some want you to sprinkle cornstarch on the skin; some call for softened butter under the skin, or even mayo; some want you to dry the bird overnight in the fridge; and on and on.\nKeller's having none of it. He knows that all that's needed is a hot oven and a generous amount of salt. You'll notice that there are very few ingredients to this recipe: really just a chicken and some S&P, plus a little butter and mustard at the end to amp up the richness and flavor. (He concedes that you can add thyme, if you must.)\nTruss the legs It's a little fussy, but trussing a chicken has an important effect on the finished product: when the wings and legs are tucked in close to the body, the end of the drumstick covers part of the breast, making sure it stays moist and helping the chicken cook evenly. Plus, Keller adds, \"it also makes for a more beautiful roasted bird.\" (Not used to trussing chicken? It's just like trussing a turkey —only easier.)\nSalt it well The most crucial step of all. \"I like to rain the salt over the bird so that it has a nice uniform coating,\" Keller writes in the recipe. Don't be shy: you want to salt the hell out of this sucker. A generous amount of salt—after you've dried the chicken well with paper towels—will help the interior of the bird stay moist while crisping the skin and enhancing the flavor.\nBlast it with heat and don't mess with it Keller doesn't bother with basting or buttering the chicken while it's in the oven. \"I feel this creates steam, which I don't want,\" he writes. Instead he lets the bird cook, unbothered, in a 450-degree oven until it's done, about 50 to 60 minutes. Only then does Keller tinker with it, adding some chopped thyme to the roasting pan and basting the bird with its juices. He then lets it sit for 15 minutes.\nAnd that's it Everything else is gravy. Because this is the world's most perfect chicken recipe, Keller says you may as well just start eating the bird while you're butchering it —to hell with your guests: \"Separate the middle wing joint and eat that immediately.\" You got it, Tom! \"I like to take off the backbone and eat one of the oysters, the two succulent morsels of meat embedded here, and give the other to the person I'm cooking with,\" he writes. \"But I take the chicken butt for myself.\"\nSame.\nAfter that, he suggests slathering the meat with good butter and serving it with mustard on the side. And there you have it. Epi's most acclaimed recipe is also its most fun, its simplest, and its most delicious.
