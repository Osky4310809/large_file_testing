James Waurishuk told TheDCNF’s Richard Pollock , referring to Flynn’s ouster from the Trump administration. Waurishuk is a veteran military intelligence official who served on the National Security Council. “We’ve never seen to the extent that those in the intelligence community are using intelligence apparatus and tools to be used politically against an administration official.” \nFlynn resigned as national security adviser after news broke alleging he spoke with the Russian ambassador about sanctions before Trump took office — potentially in violation of federal law — and then lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the call. The White House maintains Flynn didn’t break any laws, but couldn’t stay on because he lost the trust of Pence and Trump.

Republicans, in particular, have clamored for an investigation into the leak of the classified information. Such leaks are atypical, although they continue to happen as the Trump administration gets underway. \nMultiple former intelligence officials told Pollock the whole thing looks like a massive underground campaign inside an intelligence community ticked off at Trump and partial to former President Obama to undermine the new administration. \nRetired Marine Col. Bill Cowan, who interacted with intelligence officers in combat zones, said Trump’s CIA director Mike Pompeo has to clean house, or else these kinds of attacks will continue for the next four years. “The director, Pompeo, if he doesn’t get a hold of the agency and its personnel, he can expect four years of this,” he told Pollock. “Clandestine, undercover disinformation, misinformation, psychological information to undermine this administration and this president.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:20:50.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
