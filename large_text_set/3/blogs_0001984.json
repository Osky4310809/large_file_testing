I have cried about it. How can someone say something that cruel about a sick little girl?\n‘I can’t be dealing with this. Things are hard enough with Amelia’s heart problems and to hear someone talk about your daughter like that is so upsetting.\nIf you keep your milk in your fridge door, stop it ‘When they rang up they were saying the most evil things. “I’m going to rape your daughter so hard so dies”, stuff like that.\n‘They knew my daughter had a hole in her heart. Not loads of people know that so that’s why I think it’s someone who knows me, or a friend of someone who knows me.’\nShe added: ‘They said “I’m going to give her another one [hole in the heart]”. It was terrifying. No sane person says things like that.\nAmelia was born with a rare heart condition (Picture: Mercury) ‘For nine hours constantly I was getting phone calls and death threats. It was so frightening. I’m scared to stay in the house on my own so my mum’s been coming over while my partner’s at work.\n‘Amelia has had a really bad start in life – she is fed through a tube, she can’t walk or talk properly.

I really want a fresh start for my family but this is dragging us down.’\nSarah, who cares for Amelia full-time and also has a six-year-old son, Joshua, said: ‘We were so shocked at first that we didn’t know what to think. They were saying things like “we’re going to take you son’s jaw off”. It was so scary.\n‘You don’t know if these people are serious or not. What if they really do come and rape my daughter? I can’t believe they said that.\n‘Eventually we recorded one of the conversations and then I went to the police. They came out on Saturday morning and listened to the recordings.\n‘I don’t want to be alone. These people know where I live and they’re dangerous. They need to be stopped.’\n \nA spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: ‘We were called at 11.30pm on Friday February 24 from address in Preston with reports that somebody had received threats of a violent nature.\n‘We attended the next morning and spoke to the person who called us and gave them some safeguarding advice.’\n \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T12:00:19.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
