measures allowing users to flag disputed news shared on the site following concerns the circulation of deliberately fictitious articles could have influenced the US election. \nPublic Health England and the head of the Royal College of GPs have expressed concern over the amount of made-up health news shared online, with Cancer Research UK calling for “vital” action from the social network. “As Facebook is increasingly used as a news source, it’s vital that incorrect articles are contested to prevent damaging health messages from spreading,” the charity’s health information officer Dr Rachel Orritt told The Independent . \n“It’s particularly worrying to see some of these stories are related to the HPV vaccine, when we know that the HPV vaccine prevents cervical cancer.” \nOf the top five news articles with ‘HPV’, short for human papilloma virus, in the headline, the three with the most shares, likes and engagements last year have been declared \"false\" by fact-checking website snopes.com . \nSnopes is one of the third-party fact-checkers Facebook announced it would be working with to help identify fake news stories. The top five articles with 'HPV' in the headline with the most Facebook shares, likes and comments in 2016, according to web analytics tool Buzzsumo ( Buzzsumo ) \nIn September, a website called healtheternally.com, registered in Phoenix, Arizona, published an article with the headline “Dandelion weed can boost your immune system and cure cancer”. It was the most popular article on Facebook with the word ‘cancer’ in the headline last year, receiving more than 1.4 million shares, likes and comments, according to two separate web analysis tools . \nThis was around four times as many as the first relevant story from a traditional news website, the New York Times , to appear on the list. \n“This potent root builds up blood and immune system – cures prostate, lung, and other cancers better than chemotherapy [sic],” claimed the site, citing research from Dr Carolyn Hamm at the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada. One instance of the article from healtheternally.com being shared on Facebook. The headline on the site appears to have later been changed and the site seemed to be offline after 'The Independent' enquired about the article ( Screenshot taken from Facebook 27/12/16) \nThe first page of a Google search for “dandelion weed cancer” brings up little evidence-based discussion of the study, and is instead dominated by headlines such as “Dandelion root kills cancer cells in lab tests” and “This plant extract forces cancer cells to commit suicide in 24 hours!”. \nHowever, while the centre has launched a study into the plant’s potentially beneficial effects on cancer patients, Dr Hamm told The Independent no results had yet been confirmed. \n“At this point, we have just begun to accrue patients to this trial, and so it is too early to discuss results,” she said. Mark Zuckerberg rejects claims fake news influenced Trump victory \nHealtheternally.com did not appear to be online shortly after The Independent contacted the site for comment, but this may be temporary and unrelated. Its Facebook page still appeared to be live. \nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs , said fake health news could be “misleading, superfluous or incorrect and following it risks doing more harm than good.” \n“The internet can be a great source of information and advice for many health related issues, but many websites contain information that is not evidence-based and hasn’t been verified by healthcare professionals,” she said, urging the public to use reliable sites such as NHS choices or seek help from a doctor instead. \nAnd a spokesperson for Public Health England said fake news about health shared on social media could be “damaging and unhelpful”. \nThey called one recent example published by anonews.co claiming a man had “healed 5000 people from cancer” with cannabis oil “outrageous” – it had been shared 58,000 times. \nMore than half of last year's 20 most-shared, liked and commented-on news stories with \"cancer\" in the headline, seen by a combined total of millions, contain claims Cancer Research UK calls “myths” and warns against on its website. \nThese include a report published by realfarmacy.com claiming body acidity is “the truth behind cancer”, which had 584,000 Facebook engagements, and one headlined “A Secret Has Been Uncovered: Cancer Is Not A Disease But Business!” on newsrescue.com , which had 713,000 Facebook engagements. \nA spokesperson for newsrescue.com told The Independent : “Do we trust the 'authorities and charities' who lied to us for decades about sugar and cholesterol while our loved ones died as they made big sugar wealthy, or do we seek natural alternatives to complement orthodox therapy? \n“We believe the people should have a choice and the media should protect such a choice.” \nThe Independent has contacted healtheternally.com, realfarmacy.com and anonews.co for comment. Debunked myths and fake news stories Debunked myths and fake news stories 1/23 Nasa releases statement over rumours that asteroid will destroy Earth \nNasa has just debunked a recent rumour of a giant asteroid due to crash into the Earth in September. Internet conspiracy theorists have been saying that an asteroid will hit our planet sometime between September 15 and 28, destroying the American continents. Acting in its role as space-news fact-checker, Nasa has issued a statement refuting the lot of it. \"That’s the rumor that has gone viral – now here are the facts,\" it said in a press release entitled 'NASA: There is No Asteroid Threatening Earth' Alamy 2/23 Video of scorned lover who cut ex's belongings in half was actually an advert for a law firm \nRevenge is a dish best served cold, or viral on YouTube as seemed to be the case for one German ex-husband who uploaded a video of himself using power tools to saw his possessions in half so he could literally give his former wife half of everything owned. The video, titled “For Laura”, quickly went viral reaching nearly 5.8 million views with the description “Thank you for 12 'beautiful' years, Laura! You've really earned half.” Although the course of true love never did run smooth, it did seem that the jilted lover was taking revenge to a whole new level with the angst-ridden video. Now, however, all has been explained. The video was not created by a jealous ex, but filmed by a media-savvy legal company looking to expand its customer base Youtube 3/23 McDonald's claims the 'secret menu' is fake \nThe rebuttal comes following an amusing spoof article, published by the Lucky Peach, seemingly offering a smorgasbord of hidden options for the discerning customer. Among the “delights” apparently on offer are the ‘Mommie Dearest’ (five burgers speared through with coat hangers) and the Burmese Python (complete with sock). Other options include the ‘the Derrida’ – a postmodern confection consisting of a raw potato and the remains of a few chips and a partially eaten bun PA 4/23 Dead shark pictures might be fake \nPhotographs of an enormous Tiger shark fished off the eastern Australian coast have emerged on social media. NSW newspaper The Northern Star claims the four metre catch was made by a local fisherman known only as “Matthew”. The images first emerged after Byron Bay resident Geoff Brooks posted them to his Facebook timeline. However, Mr Brooks has subsequently admitted he did not take the images – but continued to claim that the photographs are “real”. Social media users have criticised the images, with some claiming they are fake Geoff Brooks, via Facebook 5/23 A fried rat had been served in KFC \nFacebook went into full \"wt \" mode after a man posted a picture of what he claims was a fried rat he had been served in KFC. As news of the supposed Kentucky Fried rat was reported and spread, the incident took a dramatic turn with Dixon sealing it in a bag and freezing it as evidence. KFC has denied it is in the business of plunging rats into boiling hot oil however, and claims the whole thing is a 'hoax'. A DNA test followed, and shows that the nugget, although distinctly rodent-shaped, was just chicken all along. Devorise Dixon/Facebook 6/23 British scientists clone dinosaur \nAn extraordinary story of the world’s first cloned dinosaur got a lot of traction on Twitter and inspired alarmist comparisons to Jurassic Park in March this year. It was also, not unexpectedly, a complete fake, including completely fabricated quotations from 'experts' and a picture that is actually of a very young kangaroo. 7/23 Mohammed Islam - A boy who 'made $72m' in his lunch break \nA New York schoolboy who reportedly made $72 million (£46 million) by trading stocks during his lunch breaks has admitted making the whole story up. Mohammed Islam, from Queens, originally told the New York Magazine he started dabbling in penny stocks aged just nine and developed a “life-long passion” for trading that was paying off. But in a later interview with the New York Observer, he said the whole story was fake and he had not made any money at all. 8/23 World’s oldest tree has been accidentally chopped down by loggers in Peru \nSeveral websites carried the “news”, seemingly without realising the entire story appears to be a hoax. It first appeared on the World News Daily Report – a fake news website carrying articles including “Isis launches satellite” and “Pterodactyl sighting in New Guinea terrorises villagers”. 9/23 Ryan Gosling adopted a baby \nA Father's Day Facebook post from \"Ryan Gosling\" detailing how he adopted an orphaned baby for a year attracted Likes from almost one million users. This was despite it having all the hallmarks of a hoax, including a link for users to \"save thousands of children and meet me while doing it\" actually redirecting to the purchase page for a Gosling t-shirt. Facebook 10/23 Macaulay Culkin dead hoax \nHow to reassure the world you’re still alive after the internet reports that you’re dead? Fake your own murder on Instagram, like Macaulay Culkin. The actor posted the above image via his band Pizza Underground’s account yesterday, following several false rumours that he’d passed away. One particularly misleading story, originally posted on MSNBC.website (not to be confused with the real MSNBC), read: “Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.” 11/23 'Crabzilla' - A fifty-foot crab dwelling somewhere off the English coast \nA satellite picture of the so-called crab, aptly dubbed ‘Crabzilla’, has gone viral after first surfacing on Weird Whitstable, a website for the supernatural curated by illustrator Quinton Winter, which deals in “phantoms, mysteries, tall tales, and artefacts”. The shadowy figure of a colossal crustacean, apparently spotted in the murky waters of Whistable, in Kent, dwarfs boats and cars on the pier it lurks besides. The invertebrate expert Paul Clark at the Natural History Museum in London has branded the photo a hoax. Photo courtesy of Weird Whitstable http://www.weirdwhitstable.co.uk 12/23 Ebola 'risen from the dead' zombie story \nThe story of dead Ebola victims rising from the dead, with the first \"picture\" of one of the zombies that has gone viral, (if it weren't glaringly obvious) is a hoax. The image on the article, while impressive, is in fact doctored picture of a zombie from the film World War Z. It appears to have taken an image of one of the film’s lab-zombies, and merged it with this picture of a “realistic movie sculpture” from Schell Studios, which the messageboard 8chan pointed out. 13/23 'Nasa Confirms Six Days of Darkness in December 2014' \n‘Satirical news site’ Huzlers.com has been spreading fake story about upcoming six days of darkness, far and wide on the web, taking in numerous Facebook and Twitter users and encouraging them to post about what they’re going to be up to during the six days of darkness. The story on the vaguely official looking website titled “Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014!” claims that an incoming solar storm is to blame, causing \"dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus block 90% sunlight”. This is false. Although solar storms certainly are real phenomena (they occur due to fluctuations in the Sun’s magnetic field) they’re not like terrestrial storms that can blow up dust and dirt. Reuters 14/23 Meet Thea, Norway's 12-year-old child bride \nA Norwegian campaign highlighting the issue of child marriage has gained global attention after a blog seemingly written by a child bride-to-be went viral. The blog, apparently written by 12-year-old girl 'Thea', charts her thoughts and feelings towards her impending marriage to 37-year-old Geir. However, the blog was carefully created by Plan, an international aid organisation working on strengthening the girls’ rights, to bring home the issue of child brides. Courtesy of Plan 15/23 Obsessive selfie-taking classified as a mental disorder \nAn article claimed that the American Psychiatric Association (a real body) had classified new mental disorder “selfitis” as “the obsessive compulsive desire to take photos of one’s self and post them on social media”. The origin of the article should have tipped off readers, however - it first appeared on a site whose owners admit that “when writing [...] we spice it up with figments of our imagination”. 16/23 Shipwrecked British woman saved by Google Earth \nThe extraordinary story of Gemma Sheridan, a woman from Liverpool saved by Google Earth after seven years stranded on a desert island, whipped up a storm among social media users. Aside from the fairly incredible details involved in the story, a wide range of issues showed it is quite clearly a hoax - including pictures and whole swathes of text borrowed from other (real) reports. Digital Globe via Waffles at Noon 17/23 Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is dead \nThe Rock became the latest victim of a death hoax this month after rumours circulated that the action star had died while filming a dangerous stunt for the upcoming Fast and Furious 7 on Thursday. The bogus report was created by Global Associated News, a website responsible for some of the most outlandish recent fake celebrity deaths, and went viral on Twitter and Facebook. Getty Images 18/23 Vaccines can cause autism \nA serious myth, this, and one which has repeatedly been rejected by scientific studies. The latest of these came earlier this year when a study that examined brain tissue samples donated by children who had died showed autism may actually develop in the womb during pregnancy. One scientist said the findings 'call sharply into questions other popular notions about autism'. Rex Features 19/23 Homeopathic remedies have medicinal properties \nProponents of homeopathy claim that it stimulates the body to heal itself, and is based on the principle of ‘like cures like’. But an Australian scientific body became the latest earlier this year to carry out a study showing that it actually works no better than a placebo. That story came after a homeopathic 'remedy' was actually recalled in the US because it contained traces of real medicine. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images 20/23 Chinese child ruined father's passport \nThis picture of a Chinese passport apparently defaced by a four-year-old boy went viral around the world, despite the fact that it seems to clearly be a hoax. The picture was originally posted on Chinese social networking site Weibo by a person claiming to be the father, known as Chen, with a plea for help. But from the uniform thickness of the lines (which actually go off the page to the right) to the covering-up of identifying details, the 'drawing' looks a lot like an adult’s handiwork on Photoshop or MS Paint Weibo 21/23 MH370 was caused by aliens/Snowden/the Bermuda Triangle \nSince the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished on 8 March with 239 people on board, the story has sparked a host of myths and conspiracy theories. While some of these theories as to how the flight could have just disappeared have not been discounted by authorities, others have tended towards the unusual, bizarre and downright ridiculous. One Malaysian politician claimed the Bermuda Triangle must have moved to Vietnam. A 'citizen reporter' said radar picked up a UFO. Another said there was a complicated link to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. None are likely to be true. Reuters 22/23 Morrissey joined Twitter \nMorrissey fans rejoiced earlier this week when the verified Twitter account @itsmorrissey posted its first tweet since joining in 2009, saying: 'Hello. Testing, 1, 2, 3. Planet Earth, are you there? One can only hope...' It seems that the Twitter blue tick seal of approval doesn’t mean as much as it used to, after Morrissey confirmed in a statement that he does not have an account on the social media site. Getty Images 23/23 Chinese people ate doves at wedding, sued ugly wives and only sing numbers from takeaway menus \nIn November last year, the western media was bombarded by a host of stories involving Chinese misrepresentations. One involved a Chinese man suing his wife 'because he was ugly' and winning - but was later debunked by an expat magazine in Shanghai. Here, Nyima Pratten writes about how our media depict Chinese people in an unreasonably negative way . Getty Images \nThree of the most-shared cancer-related news articles were human interest pieces such as “Dad of the year gets tattoo to support his cancer surviving son”, according to web analytics tool Buzzsumo. Two were not related to the disease at all but used “cancer” in a rhetorical sense. \nThe first article on the list from a traditional news site, the New York Times , headlined “Black female physicist pioneers technology that kills cancer cells with lasers,” was at just number 13 with 340,000 Facebook shares, likes and comments. \nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced he would tackle the issue of fake news and hoaxes shared on the site amid calls to redefine the social network as a media company instead of a technology platform. One in three Donald Trump supporters believe vaccines cause autism \nUsers can now report stories they believe to be fake, while those who click on stories disputed by third-party organisations belonging to the Poynter’s International Fact-Checking network will see a warning before they can access the site. \nThe Independent understands that Facebook plans to treat fake health news pieces in the same way as other fake news. \nDavid Colquhoun , Professor of Pharmacology at University College London, has been reporting cases of fake health news and other “quackery” on his blog since 2003, including examples of instances where misinformation has led to patient fatalities. \n“Quackery is rampant in areas where conventional medicine can’t do as much as people would wish. It’s partly the fault of regular doctors. It’s led people to think there’s a cure for anything, which they’re not,” he told The Independent . \n“The ones that really get my goat are the cancer quackery. It’s really cruel and kills people. It is particularly bad because of the commonness of the condition and the imperfection of conventional treatments.” \nA group of scientists and “science supporters” have launched a campaign against one of the most prolific publishers of what they believe are unverified or disputed health news stories – naturalnews.com, whose Facebook page has nearly two million ‘likes’.
