That sounds like a lot, but it’s the lowest it’s been since 1957, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nIt doesn’t take a business degree to deduct that when demand outweighs supply, prices surge. Those prices increased 20 percent in January. \nTo end this news on a good note: Bacon isn’t going to gone from our lives. \n“While bacon may become more expensive for consumers, rest assured pork industry will not run out of supply,” Deaton said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:16:14.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
