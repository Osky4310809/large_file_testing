Even though their focus is on rhinos, they, of course, won’t say no to helping elephants. And that’s exactly what they did recently. When a baby elephant was found stuck in mud , The Rhino Orphanage jumped in to help. The baby elephant has now been named Jabu , aptly meaning happiness. Jabu could not stand when he arrived because he was exhausted from struggling to get out the mud. Little Jabu received expert care , including formula and lots of rest. Caretakers report it was touch and go with Jabu, but they are happy to report he is now standing and walking on his own. Go Jabu, go! Not only has Jabu been standing and walking on his own, he has been adorable playing in his water bowl. So cute! \n\n\nWe are so thankful to The Rhino Orphanage for helping Jabu! It comes as no surprise to see how smart and playful this little elephant is and we can’t wait to see him grow and develop. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world sees elephants as the beautiful, smart individuals that they are. The reality is one elephant is killed every 15 minutes in Africa , with a staggering number of 100 killed every day for their tusks due to the illegal ivory trade . There are only 650,000 elephants remaining on the planet and they are in real danger of extinction . \nIf we can learn to see these wonderful animals as socially complex creatures and not commodities, we could make a change.
