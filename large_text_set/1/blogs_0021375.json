Sturgeon's EU dream in peril as MEPs brand Catalonia referendum 'ILLEGAL' Bad news Nicola! Sturgeon's EU dream in peril as MEPs brand Catalonia referendum 'ILLEGAL' NICOLA Sturgeon's dream of keeping Scotland in the European Union were dealt a hammer blow today as Brussels politicians reacted with open fury to Catalonia's independence plans. PUBLISHED: 11:30, Wed, Jan 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 14:03, Wed, Jan 25, 2017 AFP/YouTube/GETTY Nicola Sturgeon's independence plans have been dealt another blow \nFuming MEPs could not hide their contempt for efforts by the tiny Spanish region to split from the rest of the country and made it plain they would not welcome it into the bloc. \nThey fired volley after political volley at its plans for an independence referendum, which were touted by three Catalan MEPs at a highly controversial conference in Brussels this week. \nThe level of anger directed at secessionist politicians in Spain does not bode well for Ms Sturgeon, who wants to haul Scotland out of the UK in order to keep it in the single market. Related articles Catalonia to hold independence referendum in Brussels charm offensive \nSpanish MEPs in particular are likely to take a dim view of any attempt by Edinburgh to stay in the bloc as an independent country, given the encouragement it would provide to Catalonia. \nEurocrats have made it clear that Scotland would have to vote to leave the UK and then apply to become a member of the EU , accepting all its terms including adopting the euro. \nThe European Parliament would have to vote to approve Scotland's application which would also have to be unanimously agreed by the EU Council, leaving Spain with an all-powerful veto. GETTY Catalonia's independence referendum plan was branded 'illegal' by an MEP AFP Three Catalonian MEPs held a conference at the EU Parliament last night \nSpanish MEP Maite Pagazaurtundúam, the vice-president of the liberal ALDE group, said: “We are facing a very serious case of populism and what is an obviously an advanced form of political pathology.\" \nShe blasted Catalonia's secessionist dreams as “extremely serious for the rule of law” and said the independence movement was “not only bad for Spain but also bad for the wider European Union\". \nMs Pagazaurtundúa also branded the region's plans to hold an independence referendum as \"illegal\" and urged senior eurocrats not to engage with its politicians. \nShe called them “people that lie, people that lie about what Catalonia is, speaking in favour of an illegal referendum, committing a crime and, by repeating and repeating it, it will spread, appear normal and that is absolutely ridiculous”. They are ministers of a country that does not exist. It is very absurd. Spanish MEP Maite Pagazaurtundúa \nAnd she urged Brussels: “I hope that they are not received as usual by European Parliament leaders, given the lies they have told through pure propaganda to get there. \n\"They have lied even about their own record, since they are ministers of a country that does not exist. It is very absurd.” \nShe made the remarks after three Catalan MEPs controversially organised a conference at the European Parliament yesterday evening to promote their independence cause. \nThe trio sparked controversy after they used ALDE branding to advertise the event, bringing a stern rebuke from party leader Guy Verhofstadt who insisted it was entirely unauthorised.
