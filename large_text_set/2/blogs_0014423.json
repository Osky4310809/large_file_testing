This Is the Difference Between 8-String and 6-String Downtuned 10 Halfsteps Meaning they have an identical tuning on 6 thickest strings. UG News editor since early 2013. King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 16 hours ago 14 \nPete Cottrell from YouTube presented an interesting experiment, testing out whether you can really just downtune a 6-string guitar to get the sonic effect of an 8-string. \nSpecifically, the musician took his 6-string, downtuned it 10 halfsteps to F# and put it up against the 8-string. \nHe explained: \"One of the many criticisms of 8-string guitars is that you must use all strings, otherwise you're just djenting on the low strings. So why not just downtune a standard 6-string? Putting technical specifics aside, this kinda makes sense, right? Aren't 8-strings just low-tuned guitars? But, the proof is in the pudding, let's test this out in the context of a song.\" \nPete also pointed out about downtuning the 6-sting: \"I beefed up the string gauge and gave it a quick setup, but other than that, there's no modifications.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:24:42.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
