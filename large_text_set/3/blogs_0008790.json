For example, Iowa really loves Chex mix, Virginia is a little too into smoothie bowls, and the people of Wyoming are in search of something called \"energy bites.\" \nBut the most mind-boggling people on this list have to be those living in Arkansas, who apparently just really, really love Coca Cola. Then again, a'int that America? \nTake a look at the entire list below: \nThe Foodnited States", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:17:55.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
