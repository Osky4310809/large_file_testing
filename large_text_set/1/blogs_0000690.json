It immediately prompted backlash from those who felt it was wrong for the school to make it optional for anyone to be excluded from the pledge.\nThe slip was titled “Pledge of Allegiance Request” and included fields for the child’s name, grade and school. \n“I understand my rights as a parent and request that my child, noted above, be excused from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. This request includes standing and placing his/her hand over his/her heart,” the slip read.\n\nIn the parent/guardian signature field, the shocked mother wrote a note expressing her disbelief:\n“This is the dumbest thing I have ever read and I am so ashamed of this.\"\nThe note quickly went viral, garnering response from viewers across social media, including I Support The Police, Not Criminals and Mad World News' Facebook pages:\nNot only is this anti-patriotism, but it's especially stupid due to the fact that anyone has the right in America to not stand or place their hand over their heart for the Pledge of Allegiance anyway, as it is our right to freedom of speech ... since when did we need a permission slip for this? I feel like the permission slip is more of an attempt to push the anti-patriotism agenda than anything. it's pretty pathetic.\nWe (Americans) would never be able to go into other countries and change their laws or traditions. Why are we allowing others to do it to us? I Just don't get it!\nThis is a mad world....really, sign a paper to exclude your child from the pledge of allegiance? I guess I am from a totally different generation. I am proud to be an American....it is the best country but some are trying to do away with our history and customs....it's disturbing.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T07:33:54.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
