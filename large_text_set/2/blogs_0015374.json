Robert de Guzman, Carranglan police chief. \n“The driver of another vehicle the bus had overtaken began signaling to the driver that something was wrong with the bus. When the bus pulled over to the side of the road to check, fire at the engine bay at the back of the bus was already raging,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe bus driver and his riders were able to alight from the vehicle, but the bus was totally burned, along with the passengers’ luggage and other belongings. \nInvestigators have yet to determine the cause of the blaze, which was declared under control at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday , De Guzman said.
