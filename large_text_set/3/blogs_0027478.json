Check it out in the player below for a look at the upcoming season that features a double helping of Ewan McGregor opposite Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Carrie Coon . The Beauty and the Beast star is playing both Emmit Stussy and his slightly younger brother, Ray, when the series returns Wednesday, April 19 at 10:00pm ET/PT. \nRELATED: Meet the Whole Fargo Season 3 Cast in New Promos \nSet in 2010, Fargo season 3 follows Emmit, the Parking Lot King of Minnesota, who sees himself as an American success story. Ray, meanwhile, is more of a cautionary tale. Forever living in his more successful brother’s shadow, Ray is a balding and pot-bellied parole officer with a huge chip on his shoulder about the hand he’s been dealt – and he blames his brother. Their sibling rivalry follows a twisted path that begins with petty theft but soon leads to murder, mobsters and cut-throat competitive bridge. \nCarrie Coon stars as “Gloria Burgle,” the steady chief of the local police department. A newly divorced mother, Gloria is trying to understand the new world around her, where people connect more intimately with their phones than with the people around them. \nMary Elizabeth Winstead stars as Ray’s girlfriend, “Nikki Swango,” a crafty and alluring recent parolee with a passion for competitive bridge. \nDavid Thewlis rounds out the cast, starring as “V.M. Vargas”” a mysterious loner and true capitalist whose bosses plan to partner with Emmit, whether “The Parking Lot King” likes it or not. \nFargo season 3 hails from Peabody, Golden Globe and Emmy Award winning Executive Producers Noah Hawley (creator/showrunner/writer/director), Joel & Ethan Coen, Warren Littlefield and John Cameron. Fargo is produced by MGM Television and FX Productions, with MGM Television serving as the lead studio. \nWhat do you think of these Fargo season 3 trailer?
