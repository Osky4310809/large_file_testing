Beginning tonight, Beckel will reunite with co-hosts Eric Bolling, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Greg Gutfeld and Dana Perino. Current co-host Juan Williams will remain an FNC contributor across all programs and continue to appear on The Five. \nIn making the announcement, Murdoch said, “Bob was missed by many fans of The Five and we’re happy to welcome him back to the show.” \nBeckel commented, “I’m thrilled for the opportunity to go home again and join my television family around the table of The Five. I have no doubt it will be a vigorous yet entertaining debate.” \nOne of the most watched programs on cable television since its inception in 2011, The Five is comprised of five personalities with combined backgrounds in politics, law, business, sports, media and comedy. The co-hosts have undeniable chemistry and engage in a lively roundtable discussion. With their unique perspectives, they debate, deliberate and sometimes debunk the top news stories, issues, and controversies of the day, as well as each other. \nThe Five has been number one in cable news during its 5 PM/ET timeslot for 66 consecutive months in total viewers and 65 consecutive months in the 25-54 news demographic, consistently ranking among the top programs in cable news, according to Nielsen Media Research. During the fourth quarter of 2016, The Five averaged 2.7 million viewers, beating CNN and MSNBC combined, while attracting 462,000 Adults 25-54, surpassing both networks. Since its 2011 launch, the popular program has grown 118% in total viewers and 58% in the 25-54 demographic and today is the most-watched program in cable during its early evening timeslot in both measurements. \nBeckel first joined FNC in 2000 as a contributor providing political analysis. He later rejoined the network in 2011 as one of the originating co-hosts of The Five until 2015 and then briefly joined CNN as a commentator. He was also a columnist for USA Today through the end of 2015. \nPrior to appearing on television as a liberal analyst and pundit, Beckel had an extensive career as a political operative. He worked for the U.S. State Department from 1977-1980, serving as the youngest Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Carter Administration and most notably served as the national campaign manager for former Vice President Walter Mondale’s presidential campaign, where he oversaw the successful race for the Democratic nomination. \nFOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service dedicated to delivering breaking news as well as political and business news. The number one network in cable, FNC has been the most watched television news channel for nearly 15 years and according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll, is the most trusted television news source in the country. Owned by 21st Century Fox, FNC is available in more than 90 million homes and dominates the cable news landscape, routinely notching the top ten programs in the genre. \n###", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T03:14:54.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
