According to information from open sources one of their main goals is the creation of the new world order and the global government based on masonic principles ,” Milonov stated in his letter to Russian Prosecutor General Yury Chaika.

Presently, political parties in Russia are banned from receiving sponsorship or entering any deals with foreign and international organizations and NGOs that receive funding from abroad and get engaged into any type of political activities must register as “foreign agents.” \nMilonov reminded in his letter that historically Russian state has always controlled or sometimes even outlawed freemasons’ activities. The MP also noted that similar restrictions remain in force in several foreign nations.

Their history was complicated and for some time freemasons really were outlawed. Currently freemasons openly exist as the Grand Lodge of Russia, with several thousand members. \nAt some point freemasons attempted to influence Russian politics, albeit with very limited success. Grand Master of the lodge, Andrey Bogdanov, even ran for the presidency in 2008 (he came last of four candidates with just 1.3 percent of the vote) and also assumed a high position in the rightist pro-business political party Right Cause. \nBogdanov is also known for a row with opposition figure Aleksey Navalny – in 2013 the freemason complicated Navalny’s participation in political process by hijacking the name of political party – the People’s Alliance that the activist wanted for himself and his allies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T12:17:30.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
