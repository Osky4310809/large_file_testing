The naming of a democratic institutions minister in November 2015 set off more than a year of work related to that promise. \nBut last week a mandate letter for Karina Gould, the new minister, revealed the government is no longer pursuing a change to Canada’s voting system.\nThe about-face is more than symbolic. A significant amount of government money went towards consulting on a policy that would never come to be.\nLong hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars went toward a special parliamentary committee that spent months studying the issue. It produced a 300-plus page report in December that recommended the government hold a referendum on whether to adopt a proportional representation system, which aligns parties’ seat counts more closely to vote share.\nRelated National Post View: Thank you, Liberals, for so thoroughly botching electoral reform Colby Cosh: Was the election reform promise stupid or sleazy? I stand with Justin — it was stupid Andrew Coyne: It’s not the Liberals’ fault for lying about electoral reform , it’s yours for believing them John Ivison: Scuttled electoral reform betrays those who saw Trudeau as antidote to political cynicism The committee had a total budget of $678,560, according to its former clerk, which included money spent to travel and hold town halls across the country. The clerk couldn’t confirm whether the total allotted amount had been used up. \nTo complement the committee work, MPs were encouraged to hold town halls in their own constituencies. Expenses are only available up to Sept. 30 — more events were held in October — but an analysis found more than $3,000 out of House of Commons budgets was spent on hospitality (snacks, mostly) for those events.\nConcurrently, the former minister, Maryam Monsef, went across the country for her own series of electoral reform events. According to disclosures, travel costs included $16,145 for the minister herself and $30,532 for staff who accompanied her on different legs of the tour. Monsef also hosted a breakfast at the parliamentary restaurant, costing $1,578.\nMonsef was already softening her party’s promise in some town halls — insisting there was “no consensus” on electoral reform, despite a majority supporting proportional representation at the committee’s events. But the buck didn’t stop at the more than 270 events listed on the government’s democratic reform website (which, as of Friday, still said “the government has committed to have a new voting system put in place before the next federal election”).\nWithout committing to implementing any of the committee’s ideas, Monsef announced an online survey would help the government determine Canadians’ “democratic values.”\nFred Chartrand / Canadian Press Maryam Monsef in the House of Commons during question period on Parliament Hill, in Ottawa, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016 MyDemocracy.ca offered Canadians the chance to state preferences and values on concepts related to government, but never asked whether Canadians would want to change their voting system; and if they did, what specific type of system they would prefer.\nWitheringly mocked on social media and in the House of Commons as little more than a personality test, the survey did garner more than 360,000 responses from Canadians — at about a loonie a piece. To develop and host the website, the government paid Vox Pop Labs $369,058 (including tax), according to a document tabled in the Commons.\nThat does not include the cost of online and media ad placement, as well as printing and mailing a postcard to each of Canada’s more than 13 million households. Postcards advertised MyDemocracy.ca but did not specifically mention that the consultation was supposed to be about a potential change to Canada’s voting system.\nThe government allocated $3.4 million for “communications activities,” including the Vox Pop Labs contract, according to Raymond Rivet, a spokesman for the Privy Council Office — “important work to engage with Canadians on this important matter.” \nMuch of the spending comes from an envelope of $10.7 million, over four years, included in the 2016 federal budget. Money for the special parliamentary committee was not part of this fund, specifically allocated to support the democratic institutions ministry.\nRivet couldn’t confirm a final amount spent on the file because “the final costs have not been finalized for this fiscal year.” But ministerial travel, committee work, MP town halls and “communications activities” add up to about $4.1 million. \nA new ministry for democratic institutions — complete with 13 ministerial staff, according to a government directory — may never have been established had the Liberals not promised to make a major change to the system.  \nFinancial disclosures show the Privy Council Office was planning to allot $3.7 million annually, starting in 2016-17, for programming related to “legislation, parliamentary issues and democratic reform.” In 2015-16, the government spent about $3.3 million on the same programs.\nAlthough resources under that program go to the general parliamentary and legislative agenda, in the office’s 2016-17 report on plans and priorities, part of the mandate includes “advice and support” for the minister of democratic institutions. Still, the $3.7 million doesn’t specifically support electoral reform, according to Rivet. It constitutes “general activity,” and is separate from the money set aside for electoral reform in the budget. \nRivet said, despite the government hearing no consensus from the public, “Canadians were clear that we can do more to improve our democratic institutions.”\nA source in the minister’s office noted Monsef had other responsibilities besides the electoral reform file: implementing a new process for Senate appointments (using an independent advisory board) and introducing new legislation to repeal parts of the Conservative-era Fair Elections act (which, notably, had been brought forward without a “democratic institutions” ministry).\nGould, the source said, is “looking forward” to continuing on a new mandate that includes “efforts to defend the Canadian electoral process from cyber threats” and legislation to make political fundraisers more transparent — because, as the prime minister notes in the mandate letter, “sunshine is the best disinfectant to concerns about our political process.”\nNational Post \nEmail: mdsmith@postmedia.com | Twitter: mariedanielles \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:57:55.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
