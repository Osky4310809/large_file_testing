March 26th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Cricket/Australian Internationals/ Lyon's four wicket-haul \n“There’s a reason Australians choose to call it Mental Disintegration and not sledging,” Loganathan wrote. “The Aussies are masters at the art and the term ‘sledging’ seems too trifle, too easy to dismiss.” \nLoganathan noted that the feud between Vijay and Hazlewood escalated when the batsman tapped a dead ball with his bat in the direction of Steve Smith. \n“This infuriated the bowler more, but he must have known what he was trying was working,” he continued. \n“Suddenly, Vijay was no longer leaving the balls outside off stump. He reached wide to hit a boundary, while an edge dropped just short of the keeper. Hazlewood kept the intensity up after the ball as well. Every delivery was accompanied with a stare down. And finally, it worked. \n“In the 11th over, Vijay edged a delivery outside off stump and was caught behind. Hazlewood was triumphant, but not only because he bowled a good ball. He had also left the batsman vulnerable with a clinic in ‘Mental Disintegration’.” \nIn an interview with India Today , Sorauv Ganguly noted that Ajinkya Rahane received the captaincy from the injured Virat Kohli at an ill-opportune time , given his indifferent form in the middle. \nRahane has scored 13, 18, 17, 52, 14 and 46 against the Australians this series with one innings to play. Is Kohli saving himself for IPL? 1:06 \nCricket: On Gameday Live, Brad Hodge says he thinks injured Indian Test captain Virat Kohli may be saving himself for the cash-rich IPL tournament. March 26th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Cricket/Australian Internationals/ Is Kohli saving himself for IPL? \n“Ajinkya Rahane is scratchy,” Ganguly said. “It is not the Rahane we have seen over a long period of time. Think about the Rahane at Lord’s (in 2013) where it was seaming, decking, bouncing and he just batted as if it was a different track. \n“Imagine his hundreds in Australia. He is just a bit out of the place at the moment, maybe mentally ... the confidence has gone down a bit because he hasn’t had a good series against England. \nHe continued: “He hasn’t had a good series so far by his standards. So, his confidence level is down a bit and you can see that in his batting. I think it is not the Rahane but he is surviving, he is trying hard, he is competing ... typical Mumbai khadoosness as they say. \n“But we have seen a better Rahane. And I think once this series finishes, he will probably will have to sit down and find a way to relax and get his mind back on track,” he added. \nGavaskar conceded Australia were well positioned for one of their most famous ever series victories with three days remaining. \n“Australia certainly hold the upper hand because they’ve taken the six major wickets,” he told NDTV. “Sure, I think Jadeja can hit the ball and Saha got a hundred in the previous game, but Australia have the second new ball in their hands. It’s just about three or four overs old. \n“(Monday) morning it’s going to be very, very difficult, There is a little bit of carry in this surface. The ball is thudding into the wicketkeepers’ gloves, particularly when Pat Cummins is letting them rip, and they are getting a little bit of movement. \n“I think India will find it hard to get close to the Australian total.” \nLIVE stream the India v Australia Test Series live on FOX SPORTS.
