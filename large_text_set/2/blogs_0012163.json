She's an actress best known for her rol— haha, sorry, yeah, she's an extremely successful model (and also an actress?) known for looking like this: \nThat was something of a breakout moment for her (and released without her consent at the time , apparently), and she's since gone on to feature in, among other things, Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue. Many times. She recently took a step back from the bikini modeling life, but according to a tweet from SI posted early this morning, she's back in a big way: On all three covers of the 2017 swimsuit issue . And topless. Kate Upton is back! Get your issue at newsstands today! pic.twitter.com/MtVHEwDyj0 Wow, I feel so honored and excited to be back with Sports Illustrated!! Thank you @si_swimsuit and @mj_day for inviting me to be part of an issue that features and celebrates beauty and confidence in every shape and size #siswim17 #grateful A post shared by Kate Upton (@kateupton) on Feb 14, 2017 at 9:53pm PST \nLooking good, as she always does. But apparently, this was not a drama-free cover shoot. According to the New York Post , Kate's ego has been dogging her since 2015, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. \nSources tell us that an appearance by Upton — whose Rookie of the Year pictures in the mag in 2011 helped make her a star — is still up in the air because of her diva demands. \n“There was drama,” says the source. “Kate demanded that if she did the shoot, that she absolutely must get the cover. She also had a list of photographers and hair and makeup people she would only work with.” \nI mean, they clearly aren't \"up in the air\" at this point, given what we know now. Either way, Kate's back, and the 2017 SI swimsuit issue is almost here. \nIt represents perhaps the finest SFW ogling on the internet, so get excited. Drop This Fact \nKate Upton is surprisingly well-connected. Her uncle is Congressman Fred Upton (R-MI), and her great-grandfather co-founded the Whirlpool company.
