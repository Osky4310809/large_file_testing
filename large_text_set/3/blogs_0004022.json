Senate PRIB/Released \n  A retired police officer from Davao City claimed on Monday that he was in contact with Philippine National Police chief Ronald Dela Rosa during two operations of the alleged Davao Death Squad. \nArthur Lascañas, a retired police officer who claims to have been a member and leader of the DDS, told a panel of senators that he communicated with Dela Rosa during the kidnapping and killing of Sali Makdum and the police operation against Felicisimo Cunanan Jr., one of the most wanted individuals in Davao Del Sur. \nLascañas said that then Superintendent Dela Rosa got mad at Edgar Matobato, who also claims to have been a member of the DDS, after Makdum’s wife filed a complaint with the disbanded Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force. \nMakdum’s wife alleged that Lascañas' group asked for ransom payment from the family of Makdum, a foreign terrorist who was apprehended on Samal Island. This incident prompted her to complain. \nLascañas defended Matobato and said that he was not the one who asked for money. He said, though, that his group did. \n“Hindi si Edgar, sir, and humingi kundi kami,” Lascañas said in a Senate inquiry into killings allegedly perpetrated by the DDS in Davao City. Matobato and Lascañas claim that Duterte formed and ran the DDS while he was city mayor.   \nThe Palace has denied the allegations and dismissed them as fabrications. \nLascañas said that Dela Rosa wanted to capture Matobato, but Lascañas instead suggested that they just file a case against him. This resulted in a kidnapping case against Matobato, Sonny Custodio and two fictional individuals. Cunanan case \nThe second case in which Lascañas said he had contact with Dela Rosa was after his group together with the Highway Patrol Group of Davao City apprehended and killed Cunanan. \nLascañas said that Dela Rosa ordered him to defy Duterte’s order to kill Cunana's two companions. \nLascañas said Duterte gave the order shortly after he visited Cunanan’s companions at the office of the Heinous Crime division of the local police. \nHe said that before Duterte left, he gave the instructions to have the two killed. Dela Rosa accompanied Duterte to his car, and upon his return he told Lascañas to not execute the order. \n“Huwag mong ituloy dahil kawawa yan,” Dela Rosa allegedly told Lascañas. \nWhen asked what about Duterte’s order, De Rosa answered: “Ako na ang bahala. File-an mo lang ng kaso yung isa kasi may baril. Yung driver i-release mo.” \nLascañas also claimed in his Senate testimony that he was the one who killed Cunanan because the latter did not raise his hands and had a gun.
