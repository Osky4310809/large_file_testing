For Trump, who usually spends his weekends at his \"Winter White House\" in Mar-a-Lago, this seemed groundbreaking.

Trump spent a good chunk of the weekend golfing at Trump National Golf Club, watching golf, thinking about golf — you know the drill.\nA representative for Fox News did not immediately return a request for comment.\nAs you could imagine, Twitter users were quick to call out the alert for its failure to tell the whole truth, and um, well, being generally absurd.\nNo details from @WhiteHouse on today's @POTUS \"meetings.\" Attire and mode of transport suggest more leisurely pursuits at his golf course. pic.twitter.com/A8SsM415Js\n— Steve Herman (@W7VOA) March 25, 2017\nHuh?
