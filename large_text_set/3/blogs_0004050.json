One of the first projects announced was Bloodshot with John Wick directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski attached. Since that time the pair have gotten very busy, and even split from being directing partners, with Stahelski bringing this year’s John Wick: Chapter 2 and the in-development Highlander reboot and Leith heading off to a different comic book adaptation as he steps behind the camera for Deadpool 2 . \nNow, Valiant Entertainment has revealed at their Emerald City Comic Con panel (via Bleeding Cool ) that they’ve secured a new director for the adaptation with first time filmmaker Dave Wilson tapped to direct. Wilson worked with Deadpool director Tim Miller at Blur Studios, directing cinematics for video games including Halo 2 , Mass Effect 2 , and BioShock Infinite . \nAcademy Award nominated writer Eric Heisserer ( Arrival , The Thing ) has penned the script for the film, as well as another of the Sony/Valiant features, Harbinger . It was previously reported that Sony was hoping to develop two films in the respective Bloodshot and Harbinger franchises before crossing them over with a Harbinger War feature film, though it remains to be seen if those plans remain or will in fact materialize. \nCreated by Kevin Van Hook, Don Perlin and Bob Layton, Bloodshot tells the story of a former soldier killed and brought back to life with technological upgrades, filling his body with billions of nanobots. This allows him to be the perfect soldier by healing from injuries, shapeshift, and even interact with technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T06:27:38.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
