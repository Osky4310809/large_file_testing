An evil, duck-destroying monster.\nBut donâ€™t panic: youâ€™re not alone.\nOver on Twitter, people are in mass meltdown after a sign thanking people for not feeding bread to ducks was shared all over the place.\nWhy? Because weâ€™ve all been feeding ducks bread without a second thought, and are now racked with the deepest, darkest pangs of guilt.\nIt all started when someone shared a photo of a sign thanking people for not giving ducks any bread.\nI'VE BEEN FEEDING DUCKS BREAD THIS WHOLE TIME IM SO ASHAMED IM SUCH A MONSTER pic.twitter.com/dzyicjJc7Q \nâ€” not dallas (@proudsIytherin) March 22, 2017 \n\nâ€˜Thank you for not feeding us bread,â€™ reads the sign.\nâ€˜Bread makes us ill, as it does not contain the right nutrition or calories we need to keep us warm in winter.\nâ€˜Rotting bread pollutes our water and causes nasty surface algae, which kills our fish and gives us diseases. It also makes our water smell.â€™\nSo not only have we been failing to give ducks the nutrition they need, weâ€™ve also been ruining their water supply.\nAs we mentioned, we are monsters.\nThis message sparked a ripple of misery across the internet. i'm about to cry. i've fed so many ducks bread https://t.co/sCEn241ofv \nâ€” Maddie Stibel (@maddiestibs) March 23, 2017 \ni feel bad because i fed ducks bread many times as a kid\nâ€” v (@v21) March 23, 2017 \nIt's like that time my Mom befriended a duck by our pond and killed it because it didn't fly south for the winter lol https://t.co/82Pv3qrUWN \nâ€” Jake Alleman (@Alleman_Joy) March 23, 2017 \nbeen killing down ducks since i was about 6 then who knew they dont eat bread rip to all the fallen ducks pic.twitter.com/zCft8YpxLQ \nâ€” chay (@chayalier) March 21, 2017 \nIM SO SAD I ALWAYS GO TO THE POND AND FEED THE DUCKS BREAD https://t.co/90BgN2iysl \nâ€” ashl (@ojnghyun) March 24, 2017 \nMY HEART IS SAD PLEASE FEED DUCKS BUT JUST NOT W BREAD ðŸ¦† pic.twitter.com/hQ1lfBFPoI \nâ€” local sad baby (@bemysaddaddy) March 24, 2017 \n\nHow many ducks have we made sick? How much damage have we caused? What have we done? \nIf, like the rest of the world, you are now feeling very, very guilty, the best thing to do is to go to the park and feed your local ducks some healthy treats.\nThink oats, corn, frozen peas, cooked rice, chopped lettuce, or seedless grapes (cut in half so the ducks donâ€™t choke).\nWe must to do this. We must make it up to the ducks.\nMORE: Someone brought an emotional support duck on a plane and people loved it \nMORE: This company is offering paid â€˜puppy leaveâ€™ for new dog owners \nMORE: You can now get perfume that smells like kittens ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T11:06:10.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
