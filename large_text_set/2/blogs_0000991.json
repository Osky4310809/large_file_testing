Hey, who wouldn’t? Next week, Huawei will give a few lucky folks the chance to buy its Honor 5X smartphone for only one dollar as part of its overall Valentine’s Day sales event.\nSee also: Interview with Honor VP Zack Zhang at CES 2017 3 weeks ago Here’s how this will work. The Honor web site will hold these special flash sale events for the Honor 5X on Feb. 7, Feb. 8 and Feb. 9. On each of those days, the event will begin at 1 p.m. Eastern time (10 a.m. Pacific time). The first three buyers of the Honor 5x at that time will be able to get it for just $1, rather than paying its normal $199.99 price tag.\nIn case you are interested in joining the sale, the Honor 5X has a 5.5-inch 1080p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 processor, 2GB RAM, and 16GB of onboard storage, with a microSD slot to add even more storage. It also has a 13MP rear camera, a 5MP front-facing camera, a fingerprint scanner, and a 3000 mAh battery. Not bad for $199.99, and it’s excellent if you are lucky enough to snap it up for $1.\nIf you don’t think you will have a chance in getting the Honor 5X for one dollar, the company is currently selling the Honor 6x and the Honor 8 with both discounts and freebies from now until Feb. 14. The Honor 6x is priced at $249.99 during the sale, a $39.99 discount from its normal $289.98 price tag. The phone will also come with some extra free accessories, including earphones, a case and a selfie stick.\nThe Honor 8 with 32GB of storage is on sale for $319.99, or $133.99 off its normal $453.98 price. The 64GB version is discounted down to $369.99, or $133.99 off its normal $453.98 price. Buying either version will also get you some free extras, including a case, a selfie stick and a power cord.\nWill you take a shot at getting the Honor 5X for just one dollar? Let us know if you will give it a go in the comments!\nGet them at the Honor Store ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T20:12:51.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
