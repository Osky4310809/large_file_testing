You never know. I think President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group.” \n“You know, some of the leaks, which are very serious leaks because they’re very bad in terms of national security — but I also understand that’s politics. And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics, and it will probably continue,” he added.   \nYou can watch his full remarks here: \nIt really wouldn’t surprise anyone if Obama was behind some of these leaks and protests . It is almost certainly some of his people who are still working in the federal government who are leaking everything they can get their hands on in an effort to hurt this administration. \nInstead of letting Trump get his footing in the federal government, Obama and his goons are most likely trying to sabotage his presidency because they are bitter that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
