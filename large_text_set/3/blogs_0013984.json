But while it may seem like your world is ending, it is most certainly not. It's actually the beginning of your journey with yourself. Once you get over the initial pain, hurt, and anger, you will realise that being alone is not that bad. You get more time to do things you want, and, more importantly, focus on yourself and the people you love. If you're still on the fence about being alone, here are five things that might help you realise that being on your own is not as bad as you think. You are your own primary focus \nBeing in a relationship automatically tunes you into functioning as a unit, and aligning yourself more to your partner, in every way. Along the way, you might even lose time and a sense of yourself, and do fewer things just for you. When you're alone, it gives you an opportunity to focus on yourself for a change. It allows you to non-distractedly work towards your own goals, and bettering yourself in whatever ways you want. It also gives you the time to really get to know yourself and who you are. It gives you time to be with the people who really matter \nSometimes in a relationship, you get so caught up being with your partner that you neglect the other important people in your life. If you're single, you have a lot more time to give to the people who have been by your side through everything. You have the freedom to do whatever you want \nA relationship can sometimes be binding, not in a bad way, but just in the general sense that you are living aligned with someone else. And this can be limiting, sometimes. When you're not in a relationship, you are free to live as you please, try new things, meet new people, and just live life on your own terms. It will give you a better view on how life works \nA break-up can be eye-opening in many ways. Relationships come and go. If you reflect on the choices you have made, leading up to this point in life, you'll have a better idea of the fleeting nature of existence and happiness, and it will give you a sense of the things you should give your time and energy to on priority. You're getting ready for the next relationship \nNo, this doesn't have to be something that you are consciously making an effort towards. But the time you're spending with yourself, the people you love, figuring things out about your life, etc. might actually be preparing you for your next relationship. And it might even give you a better idea of the kind of person you would want to be with, in the future.
