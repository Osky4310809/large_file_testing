Kroeger will remain a senior adviser to Lowe. \nJones’“broad experience of the media sector and know-how as a professional communicator will be instrumental as we position Scripps Networks for growth and competitive advantage in this fast-evolving marketplace,” Lowe said. \nSNI has been the subject of persistent takeover talk in recent years as the company has a small but valuable cluster of lifestyle-oriented cable networks including Food Network, HGTV, Cooking Channel, Travel Channel and DIY. \nJones joined SNI last year after running his own PR consulting firm and serving as a senior exec at EMI Group.
