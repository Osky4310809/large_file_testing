So she decided to do something about it.\nLast week, a group show called \" Strong Female Character \" started at the Hot Art Wet City gallery. It features the art of Mandy Tsung, who started her \"Bitchy Resting Face Project\" in 2015, in which she painted portraits of women who sent her selfies.\nSEE ALSO: Glowing bike path in Dutch town is like a moving Van Gogh painting\nNew #bitchyrestingfaceportrait üòÅ Come see them all in January at @hotartwetcity for the Strong Female Character show. * If you'd like to submit a photo of your bitchiest (autocorrect just tried to change this to \"butt horsey\" üòÜ) resting face, please send it to mandytsung@gmail.com. If at all possible, please make it a sharp high res image with a pose similar to this one. Thanks!\nA photo posted by Mandy Tsung (@mandytsung) on Dec 12, 2016 at 1:37pm PST\n\"All women know how infuriating it is if someone tells you to smile when your face is simply relaxed,\" she wrote on her blog when she started the project . \"This is the most natural face a woman can make; her most honest expression, and yet it is so unsettling that strangers feel the need to do something to stop it. Perhaps it's because it makes it hard for them to enjoy her, to objectify her.\"\nShe added, \"By depicting women as we are naturally, I hope to erase the shame and negativity that we feel about simply being ourselves.\"\nOpening reception for Strong Female Character is happening this Friday at @HotArtWetCity! I'll be showing my #bitchyrestingfaceportrait series alongside work by @bronwyn.schuster and @sherrirogers. Hope to see you there üòÉ\nA photo posted by Mandy Tsung (@mandytsung) on Jan 10, 2017 at 10:42am PST\nTomorrow is the opening for our group show, Strong Female Character! I'll be releasing signed prints of each #bitchyrestingfaceportrait in the show. You'll be able to pick them up at the opening or online once I've updated my shop over the weekend. * If I've used your face for one of these I'll be getting in touch to send you your complementary one.\nA photo posted by Mandy Tsung (@mandytsung) on Jan 12, 2017 at 3:36pm PST\nFinally had a chance to do another bitchy resting face portrait! I've received so many submissions I'm not sure I'll be able to paint them all, but I'll try. This has been a really good exercise in letting go and learning unexpected things about myself, so thank you to everyone who is participating. #bitchyrestingfaceportrait\nA photo posted by Mandy Tsung (@mandytsung) on Mar 15, 2015 at 3:59pm PDT\nMy first painting for a new series that I'm calling the Bitchy Resting Face Project. It's all about celebrating the expression women have when we're just being ourselves and not trying to please anyone. I'm asking women to send me their BRF selfies so I can do a bunch of paintings.
