No. Not as far as I'm concerned. \n\"I don't think that we add somebody [in January]. \n\"We had a lot of new players and it all takes time [to settle]. Even the German guys, who have a lot of experience, you have to admit that it took its time for them [to settle]. Every change in a club takes time. \nDortmund ease past Standard \n\"Right now, the group is growing together. We had to change a lot because we had too many injuries. We wish for more players to be healthy, more players on the pitch who can play week after week, they need those minutes. \n\"Right now, we don't want to add somebody.\" \nDortmund are sixth in the standings and return to action against Werder Bremen on January 21.
