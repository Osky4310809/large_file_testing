he’s reading to kids at the White House, hitting up local bookstores on Black Friday, or giving recommendations to his daughters, President Barack Obama may as well be known as the Commander in Books.\nPOTUS is an avid reader and recently spoke to the New York Times about the significant, informative and inspirational role literature has played in his presidency, crediting books for allowing him to “slow down and get perspective.” With his presidency coming to an end this Friday, EW looked back at Obama’s lit picks over the years — because it can’t hurt to read like a great leader. #ObamaForBookClubPresident2017, anyone?\nSee a comprehensive list of every book Obama has recommended during his presidency:\nBooks for Daughters: \nWhen asked what books he recommended to his 18-year-old daughter Malia, Obama gave the Times a list that included The Naked and the Dead and One Hundred Years of Solitude. “I think some of them were sort of the usual suspects […] I think she

One Hundred Years of Solitude , Gabriel García Márquez\n3. The Golden Notebook , Doris Lessing\n4. The Woman Warrior , Maxine Hong Kingston\nIndependent Bookstore Purchases: \nIn November 2014, Obama took a trip to D.C. independent bookstore Politics and Prose to honor small businesses and add to his personal library.

Obama is also a fan of sci-fi titles like Liu Cixin’s The Three-Body Problem for the escapism they provide. “The scope of it was immense,” he said . “So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty — not something to worry about.
