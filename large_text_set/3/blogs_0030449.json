But when asked about the studio's future -- specifically what type of game he'd like to make -- he had this to say:\n\n\"Since I've already started work on several, it would be a spoiler if I said something. One thing I can say is that our stance on game production has not changed. In making a new game, we're not being conscious of making something that resembles Dark Souls , or on the other hand of making something that doesn't resemble Dark Souls . Not being concerned about whether it is similar to Dark Souls , I plan on making a game that I want to make now, and that is interesting and worthwhile.\"\nAs much as I genuinely do want more action-RPGs with intricate worlds to come out of From Software, to my mind, there's no better sentiment than \"I want to make what I'm passionate about.\"\nDark Souls III director not concerned about whether or not his next game resembles Dark Souls [Gematsu]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:27:11.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
