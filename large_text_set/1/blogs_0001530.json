Feel gHood Musik, Tiger JK’s agency, clarified that this does not mean that Tiger JK is retiring: “It simply means that this will be the last album released under the name Drunken Tiger.” This will be the first official Drunken Tiger album released under the name in roughly eight years since the album “Feel gHood Musik: The 8th Wonder” in 2009, although there was an unofficial Drunken Tiger album featuring Yoon Mi Rae and Bizzy, “The Cure,” in 2013. Feel gHood said that the direction of Tiger JK’s future activities has yet to be determined. He may continue working with MFBTY (a hip hop group made up of Tiger JK, Yoon Mi Rae, and Bizzy), or he may take on solo activities. Outside of his own music, Tiger JK make be focusing more on promotions for Junoflo, who signed with Feel gHood in August 2016, or work on expanding his agency with more artists. Tiger JK debuted as Drunken Tiger with DJ Shine in 1999. After promotions for the group’s 5th album, DJ Shine left the group and Tiger JK promoted as Drunken Tiger alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T10:40:59.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
