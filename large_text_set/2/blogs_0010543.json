The strawweight pairing was announced during the UFC 208 preliminary broadcast on Saturday night. UFC Fight Night 108 will take place at the Sprint Center and will also include the following bouts: Tim Elliott vs. Louis Smolka at flyweight; Devin Clark vs. Jake Collier at light heavyweight and Andrew Sanchez vs. Anthony Smith at middleweight. Waterson returned from more than a year-long layoff in emphatic fashion at UFC on Fox 22, as she submitted popular Team Alpha Male product Paige VanZant with a rear-naked choke 3:21 into the opening round of their headlining clash. The former Invicta FC atomweight queen debuted in the Octagon with a third-round submission of Angela Magana at “The Ultimate Fighter 15” finale in July 2015. After falling to Carla Esparza in the finals of “The Ultimate Fighter 20,” Namajunas reeled off successive victories over Angela Hill , VanZant and Tecia Torres . However, the 24-year-old “Thug” dropped a split verdict to Karolina Kowalkiewicz in a No. 1 contender’s bout at UFC 201 in her last outing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:16:45.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
