The Leafs are in no rush, but the choice couldn’t be clearer. Leaf Auston Matthews looks like captain's material less than half a season into his NHL career, Damien Cox writes. ( Steve Russell / Toronto Star ) | Order this photo By Damien Cox Sports Columnist Mon., Jan. 2, 2017 Mid-September would work well. Or perhaps a press conference in August. This we know: Auston Matthews is going to be named the next captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the 19th player to hold that honour, and the first American born. It’s just a question of timing now. There is no hurry to make this announcement and it won’t happen this season. The decision on when to give Matthews the “C” is one of many issues facing this young, improving hockey team, and not even close to the most critical. But it is the one with the most clear-cut answer. The matter has been settled before Matthews even finishes his first half-season as a Leaf. Article Continued Below He’s been that impressive in every important way. The team hasn’t had a captain, as you know, since Dion Phaneuf was traded to Ottawa last winter, and you’d have to say the absence of a captain hasn’t exactly held this club back. After finishing dead last out of 30 franchises last season, the Leafs, as of Monday morning, had the 14th-best record in the league. So if you wished to play devil’s advocate, you could argue there’s no need to name a captain at all. But we know traditional hockey people generally believe in the need to have a designated leader, and the decision-making group led by Brendan Shanahan, Lou Lamoriello and Mike Babcock would undoubtedly fall into that category on this issue. There isn’t a more seasoned player on the roster who fits the job description. Of the younger vets, Nazem Kadri doesn’t have the temperament and Jake Gardiner is really still finding his game (and doing so commendably this season). Morgan Rielly, 22, would be a possible candidate and clearly is viewed already as a leader by the club’s many freshmen players. But it is Matthews who will receive this honour, probably in time to drop the puck next fall, and for very clear reasons. At 19, he is the team’s best player, and this in many ways is already his team. Matthews has demonstrated impressively that he can handle the “white noise” that comes with playing in Toronto, the fact that every home in the city contains an armchair coach and the media scrutinizes the club as closely as any NHL club in North America. Neither reality seems to faze him in any way, or even factor into what he’s doing. This team has had many players in recent years who knew how to suck up to the media to enhance their profile. Matthews doesn’t seem to have the slightest interest in that, or in being a flamboyant showman. There’s a little bit of gentlemanly Mats Sundin in his demeanour, but also a little bit of Wendel Clark as well, that no-nonsense “thanks, but I’ll just play the game” approach. Some prefer their captains a little more fiery, the sort who wouldn’t hesitate to grab a malingering teammate by the scruff of the neck and push him up against a wall, like Mark Messier famously once did to Esa Tikkanen. Matthews isn’t that kind, and once he becomes captain you can bet those types of critics will hold that against him when things don’t go well. But from scoring four goals in his first NHL game to calmly riding out a 13-game goal-less slump to scoring twice more on Sunday in the first game the Scottsdale native had ever played outdoors, there is an unflappable feel to Matthews as he goes about building his hockey story. With parents already bringing their kids to games so they’ll remember seeing him as a teenager, he is already the first Leaf player to score 20 goals in his first 40 games since the legendary Charlie Conacher. Too inexperienced? Well, he’s as experienced as Connor McDavid, who seems to be doing just fine as captain of the Edmonton Oilers. Indeed, this is really Matthews’ second professional season, even though the NHL doesn’t count his Swiss league campaign against his rookie status, and he has already played in a World Cup and an IIHF world championship. Matthews can grow into the position, like McDavid will and Erik Karlsson has in Ottawa, and if you were to make someone else the captain, an egg timer would come with the appointment. Matthews is everything you’d want in a captain, except he’s not 25 years old yet. If Steven Stamkos had been signed last summer, that would have complicated matters and probably forced Matthews to wait. Now, the Leafs can hold off a little bit longer just to make sure this plays out in a more comfortable fashion that it did when Phaneuf was made captain. The big defenceman was wrongly force-fed as captain to Leaf fans who barely knew him after just 26 games in a Toronto uniform. As it quickly became apparent he was never going to be the special, Norris Trophy-type blue-liner it initially appeared he would be in Calgary, his position as Leaf captain became awkward and, ultimately, untenable. We’ll never know how Phaneuf would have fared as a Leaf if he’d been allowed to just be a player. Matthews may become the first Leaf to win the Calder Trophy since Brit Selby in 1966, and if he stays healthy is likely to lead the team in scoring. He may even lead it to the playoffs. If some or all of those things happen, there will be no opposition to having him named as captain, maybe in a special news conference next summer or perhaps near the end of training camp next fall. The Leafs could wait longer, but what would be the point? They know what they have, there’s organizational stability to support him and Matthews has demonstrated he can lead by quiet example, and with poise. It’s just a question of when they’ll sew the “C” on his jersey. Damien Cox is the co-host of Prime Time Sports on Sportsnet 590 The FAN.
