New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement, “ Local governments seeking to protect their immigrant communities from federal overreach have every right to do so.” \nBoston’s Democratic mayor Marty Walsh said that “if necessary, we will use City Hall itself to protect anyone who is targeted unjustly.” Newark’s Democratic mayor Ras Baraka said, “Newark has a policy of protecting undocumented immigrants from deportation by U.S. immigration authorities. We see no reason to change that policy.” \nNew York City’s comptroller recently announced the city could lose under $7 billion annually due to its sanctuary status, but New York mayor Bill de Blasio does not appear to be afraid. He tweeted, “we are not going to deport law-abiding New Yorkers,” and added that the city has “solid ground for a legal challenge to the executive order should the occasion arise.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T05:20:07.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
