(You can re-watch or read the transcript over at CNBC .)\nDeadspin editor Timothy Burke tweeted a mashup video that used a snippet of that line and bled it into almost the same line from Bane in “Dark Knight.”\npic.twitter.com/dYECwneW1R \n— Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) January 20, 2017 \n“We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich!” said Bane, played by actor Tom Hardy. “The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with their myths of opportunity and we give it back to you. The people.”\nThe Bane line follows with people being freed from jail cells and the rich being kicked out of their fancy houses.\nPresident Trump’s day (we hope?) went in a different direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T02:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T22:17:02.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
