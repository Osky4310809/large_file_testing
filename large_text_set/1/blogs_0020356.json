And to those who are looking for healing at this time, I hope I can offer some inspiration for you to remain fighting. And for those of you who know I have taken a leave of absence from Stanford, an undergrad degree in hand and one currently left incomplete, I hope this can serve to inform you why. And before I begin, let me reiterate: This is in fact for my friends and family who voted for President Trump. I know you are there, and I hope that you take the time to hear me out. Congratulations. You did it. You have voted and now successfully have seen your candidate officially sworn into the presidency. I hope that President Trump proves me wrong and becomes one of the best presidents our country has seen. I’ll be honest with you. When I first heard the news that President Trump had in fact won the election, I was overwhelmed and filled with shock, grief, and anger. Over the past ten weeks, I have spent the time in deep reflection of how I can best respond to this election. What I realized was that while I was disappointed that Hillary was not successful in her race, the majority of my shock and anger actually was directed to myself. See, I have spent the past four years at one of the greatest universities in the country trying to better understand the society around me. Stanford has allowed me to question my own values and slowly mature into a young man. I began genuinely believing that I understood how I fit into this world and how to make change because of the skills and experiences Stanford allowed me to experience. However, only a few months after graduation, I was quickly knocked off of my high horse when President Trump took enough electoral college votes. What I viewed as a blatant and disgusting platform built upon misogynistic, homophobic, sexist, and discriminatory actions and remarks, others viewed as a platform of hope and opportunity. While I was seeing policy that degraded and neglected large parts of our country, others were seeing policy that provided them hope and opportunity in their own communities. This realization allowed me to identify the true source of my anger. While the powder keg of emotions were ignited from the policy our new President has proposed, I finally recognized that I was most saddened with myself. I had spent four years trying to prepare myself to understand the world, my country, and communities around me. Ironically, while in this process, I was actually causing myself to become more and more disconnected with half of my country. I was in a bubble. A giant echo chamber. An environment that didn’t allow me to understand the mindset of a large part of my country. It took a heartbreaking election and nearly two months for me to unveil my true source of disappointment. My senior year at Stanford, I started a graduate program focused upon using my background to help address the health disparities faced by low-income communities. After my first official quarter as a graduate student, I made a very difficult decision to take a leave of absence from my master’s program in the Stanford School of Medicine. I had gotten into my dream program, yet I felt more unfulfilled than ever. I realized that I could not spend another day sitting idly around as someone prepared to start dismantling a piece of policy which directly helped over 20 million people receive the healthcare they needed, an area I am passionate about. As a result, I have decided I will longer be silent and subdued by my shock. I quickly submitted my leave of absence and planned how I would spend my next year. I have started using my free time to volunteer at the local Redwood City Planned Parenthood in order to lend my skills to an organization that I believe is doing powerful and needed work. In addition, I committed to myself to continually stand up for what I believe in. That is what I find so beautiful about our institution, the fact that I can voice and advocate for my opinions. That is what pushes our society forward. It is fundamental to our government. So that brings me to you. I hope that you will do the same. My loved ones, the ones I have neglected to understand. I ask you to voice your opinions, to help me to understand what your feelings are and where you hope to see our society improve. I have committed to myself to speak to one Trump supporter every two weeks this year and write about what I learned from each of these conversations. This is how I will become a more informed and a better citizen of our great nation. I am optimistic that together, with open conversation and the willingness to learn from one another, we can continue to build upon both the progress and the hiccups that have allowed us to become what I consider to be the greatest nation and to help heal the great divide we feel today. So if you are willing and able to talk and help me to learn about the struggles my fellow citizens, I would love to treat you to a meal , please reach out — no matter how near or far you are, I will figure out how to make it happen. I am excited to learn from you and hope that we can slowly bring ourselves together once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:34:52.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
