Emile Sande will lead the music at the end of the rally (Photo: Reuters) \nInfamous for his “grab her by the p***y” remarks, Trump’s election led to women’s marches around the world earlier this year. \nHelen said: “It’s not just about Trump – there are many other examples of sexism and a lack of support for diversity or willingness to reach out to the most vulnerable from those in positions of power right across the globe.” \nGreat-grandmother Emmeline is considered one of the 20th century’s most important figures. Annie Lennox will also be at the march (Photo: Getty) \nHer grandmother, Sylvia Pankhurst, also became a ­driving force of the suffragettes. \nHelen will be joined today by ­Bianca Jagger, Annie Lennox and London mayor Sadiq Khan . \nThe rally will end with a mass sing-along of Aretha Franklin’s Respect led by Emeli Sandé and Melanie C. \nHelen said: “If we didn’t have the vote we wouldn’t be marching today, but equally we need to campaign against current expressions of sexism and inequality to keep up pressure.” For more information, visit care international.org.uk/march4women Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:48:50.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
