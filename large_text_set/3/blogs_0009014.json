Two years in a row he's been named the best metal drummer out there. They have very dedicated fans and their music is intense, and I like intense music. \n\"It's complicated. I couldn't do it. I've seen him up close and I don't know how he does it. I had nothing to to do with it. He taught himself. \n\"He'll be 27 this year and he's just a killer drummer and a great kid. It's so much fun for me to see him play, and he's a virtual artist. He lives in Nashville. He's doing quite a bit of stuff. He's writing songs on his own and the band is making plans to do another record, a follow-up to the last one, which did very well.\" \nAsked whether he stood in the audience at 'Knot shows, Max replied: \n\"I don't go up front. I won't go up front since I'd get knocked around. I watch on the side of the stage or at the board. The drums and the vocals are the loudest things in the mix and the way he plays double bass, he's got one of those drum sets and uses all of it. That's been very pleasing for me.\" \nThe drummer added: \"The other night we got an audible for ' Radio Nowhere ' and I never play that song without thinking of Jay because everyone says that Jay just kicked my ass on that song and played it so much better than I did. I stole a lot of the licks he used on that song.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T17:22:57.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
