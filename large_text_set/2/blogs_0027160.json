For a recent wedding, the actress picked an embroidered number that needs a good long look, from all possible angles, before it can be labelled. So, let’s give this a shot?

It’s an Anamika Khanna outfit so it is all the above things, if not more. \nWe are settling on this – It’s an embroidered one-shoulder democratic number, that deceivingly metamorphoses into a sari, high-fiving fringes, and asymmetry along the way.
