It simply wouldn't be possible for them to do that. \nMSN among the losers in CL draw \n\"All the Juve players are dangerous. Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain are fantastic, but the real strength of the side lies in the defence. \n\"Messi, Neymar and Suarez are a trio who can create a lot of problems, but we're Juve, and we know how to defend.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T21:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T10:46:52.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
