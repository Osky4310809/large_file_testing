The product of Samsung’s hard work is a notebook that’s optimized to help users enjoy a more convenient and streamlined experience, and new levels of mobility. \nMaximized for Mobility \n\nWith the Notebook 9, feeling is believing. That’s because it’s incredibly light. Weighing in at just 1.8 pounds**, the 13.3-inch Notebook 9 is recognized as one of the lightest notebook on the market today, making it effortless to carry and perfect for getting work done on the go. \n\nTo help users enjoy even greater levels of mobility, Samsung went to great lengths to ensure that the Notebook 9’s battery would be exceptionally versatile, and capable of charging via a variety of means. Hence, the new notebook’s ability to conveniently charge via both USB Type-C smartphone chargers as well as external battery packs that provide more than 10 watts of power. \n\n\nAchieving such compatibility, which adds considerable convenience and ensures that Notebook 9 users are never far from a power source, was no simple feat. \n\nTo further boost users’ mobility, Samsung also optimized the Notebook 9’s battery with Adaptive Fast Charge technology (AFC), so you can power up fast and get to work faster. The 13.3-inch model’s battery lasts up to 7 hours on a single charge (the 15-inch model’s lasts 15), and fully charges in just 80 minutes. That means a quick 20-minute charge provides over two hours of power (or more than 3.5 hours for the 15-inch device)***. \nA Balanced and Functional Design \n\nWhen honing the Notebook 9’s aesthetic, Samsung envisioned a design that would complement the technology within the device rather than draw attention away from it. The color options, for instance – Crush White, Violet Blue and Light Titan – were selected because they exude elegance and aesthetic harmony. Thanks to this ‘neutral’ approach, the notebook looks balanced and is comfortable to use. \n\nThe Notebook 9’s design is also heavily informed by function. Rather than focusing on a design that looked thin and featured tapered edges, the team made sure that the notebook’s corners were soft and rounded. Seemingly small touches such as this make the Notebook 9 incredibly easy to grip and slip into a bag before heading out the door. \nStrength Backed by Rocket Science \n\nThe Notebook 9 derives its lightness and strength from its single-shell structure and Samsung’s use of a newly developed magnesium compound. Incorporating this lightweight and sturdy material into the Notebook 9’s solid, single-shell design has allowed Samsung to create a notebook that’s not only seamless and incredibly strong, but also exceptionally thin and not prone to bend. \n\nThe development team managed to add further strength to the Notebook 9’s design by reinforcing its body through Micro Arc Oxidation (MAO) – a hardness-boosting surface treatment commonly used in the aerospace, aviation and defense industries. \n\nThe electrochemical process involves applying a thick, largely crystalline oxide coating to the notebook’s body that provides ample protection against corrosion, shocks and general wear and tear. Employing this ‘rocket science’ allowed Samsung to bolster the Notebook 9’s hardness while maintaining its market-leading lightness. \nStreamlined for Productivity \n\nPC and mobile technologies are vital in this digital age, which is why Samsung consistently strives to identify ways to leverage its leading experience with these technologies to create streamlined, integrated solutions. With this in mind, Samsung incorporated productivity-boosting software such as PC Message and PC Gallery****, which allow users to manage messages (SMS and MMS), videos and photos between their smartphone and Notebook 9 with a simple sync of the two devices. \n\nIn addition, the Notebook 9’s near edge-to-edge Samsung RealView Display makes snapped photos truly pop, with support for true-to-life colors, high brightness levels and a wide viewing angle. To offer users more freedom to take their work outside, Samsung also added an Outdoor Mode to the Notebook 9’s display settings, which provides clear visuals even in strong sunlight. \n\nTough security is essential no matter where you work, which is why the Notebook 9 also features a highly versatile fingerprint sensor. Featuring support for Windows Hello, this tool enables users to comfortably and securely sign in to their Notebook 9 with a single touch. \n\nEnjoy a versatile and powerfully portable notebook experience with the new Notebook 9! \n\n\n\n* All functionality, features, specifications and other product information provided in this document including, but not limited to, the benefits, design, pricing, components, performance, availability, and capabilities of the product are subject to change without notice or obligation. \n\n** Weights vary depending on country or manufacturing process. \n\n*** Battery life is based on internal testing conducted by Samsung.
