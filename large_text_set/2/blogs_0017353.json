ALL COLORS NO GENRES is their main mission – from hip-hop to indie, electronica, R&B and pop, COLORS BERLIN allows artists to present themselves and their work in a contemporary way. We’ve teamed up with them on a series of video shorts in which artists are invited to perform one of their own tracks in the COLORS studio. \nThere are approximately ten seconds of the video above in which you can adequately prepare yourself for the rap onslaught that is to follow. But then again, with a rapper like Devlin, you’re never going to be prepared enough to handle the actual fire he spits out of his mouth.\nDevlin is nothing short of a legend in the UK Grime scene. Born and raised in London, he was a previous member of The Movement and current staple within the O.T. Crew, but he is more than capable of handling himself as a solo act.\nJust earlier this month he released his third album proper, the aptly titled The Devil In . It is from this record that the above song, “Corned Beef City”, comes from. And as far as rapping for filth goes, consider this COLORS performance a 101 lesson.\nWatch the video for album cut “Cold Blooded” below.\n\nBe sure to check out our previous installment of COLORS Berlin with Dillon Cooper right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:00:03.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
