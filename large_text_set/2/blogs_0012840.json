How did I miss that?\n— Dorothy Winsor (@dorothywinsor) February 16, 2017\nIs it Festivus already? A lot of grievances are being aired\n— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) February 16, 2017\nEvery day is now Festivus.\n— Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) February 16, 2017\nSure, the press conference was missing a few things: a pole (with a very high strength-to-weight ratio) and the feats of strength. But the airing of grievances was pure Festivus, which would mean Donald Trump is Frank Costanza.\nWhile the rest of the world is worried about the economy and climate change, Trump can't stop complaining about how Jerry and Elaine didn't say hello to him when they saw him in the city, or that the Seinfelds are trying to keep him out of Del Boca Vista.\nAnd while Trump fixates on minor slights and imaginary transgressions, we're all George, wondering how exactly our lives turned out like this.\nThere is one difference between Frank and Donald, though. Frank didn't get out of military service.\nBONUS: 'Seinfeld' with hamsters", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreePress?src=hash", "https://t.co/iVhldo6ZbG", "https://twitter.com/KatyTurNBC", "https://twitter.com/BCAppelbaum/status/832290977981296641", "https://t.co/XETiVuvO9v", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/agRrxvGM.m3u8", "https://t.co/EjpKWx4wgO", "https://twitter.com/LuayJahshan/status/832320095011627008", "https://twitter.com/jaketapper", "https://twitter.com/dorothywinsor/status/832327911868887040", "https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/832293325231251457", "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/832333344260157441", "https://twitter.com/joanwalsh/status/832307039229640705", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrumpPressconference?src=hash", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/agRrxvGM.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-17T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:55:55.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
