Marty Fosse, who owns both, said that he’s sold the restaurant spaces. He also owns Anteprima which will remain open. The last day of service for Acre and Ombra is Saturday. After more than 40 years in the restaurant business, Fosse—a former GM at Spiaggia—said he wanted to consolidate. He compared it to raising a child who had grown into an adult and flying the coop. It’s time for dad to pack up. “Anteprima has always been my passion, and now I can indulge more at this point in time,” Fosse said. “It’s definitely a bittersweet moment, but I’m ready for kind of a new chapter.” Fosse added that he’s had thoughts about the sale for about two years. He didn’t want to share whom he sold the restaurant to, preferring them to reveal details themselves. The neighborhood will be pleased, as the new owners are familiar with Andersonville. Fosse “couldn’t be happier” about the new tenants. Ombra staff revealed the news via a Facebook post. \nA sweet note from one of our guests after hearing the news that January 28 is our last day of business. Be sure to come visit us and our big brother, @acrechicago , before we close our doors for good. Posted by Ombra on Wednesday, January 25, 2017 Acre, a brunch favorite with a formidable beer list, took over the former Charlie’s Ale House space back in 2010. Acre’s pub menu made it a popular happy hour space, aided by cheap oysters. Originally, Acre served from two menus, depending if patrons sat in the bar or dining room side. That became confusing, which is one of the reasons Fosse divided the space in 2012 to create Ombra to reduce confusion and to help fill the 140 seats. Neither Acre or Ombra will host any special events to mark the closing. Fosse said he’s fortunate with Anteprima to remain part of Andersonville’s restaurant scene. “Andersonville is close to restaurant Nirvana; we have a very diverse community up here,” he said. “There are great people up here; they’re just nice people. Being nice is actually very easy. Our neighborhood has been unbelievably supportive for many, many years with everything that we’ve done.” Say those goodbyes on Saturday for Acre and Ombra’s last dance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T04:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T00:10:27.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
