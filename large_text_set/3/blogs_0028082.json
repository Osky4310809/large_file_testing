Turner apparently considered the boys to be friends of hers. \nHowever, that’s hard to believe since they allegedly shot her for contacting one of them on Snapchat too much. According to Sheriff Deputy Brian Groves, the teen boys were bothered and annoyed by Turner’s messages on Snapchat. \nThey literally said they “wanted to get rid of her.” Teen girl recovering after being shot in the head; juvenile suspects bound over for trial https://t.co/bCBMcJMHGf \n— FOX 13 News Utah (@fox13) March 23, 2017 \nGroves said one of the boys first began joking about killing the 14-year-old Utah girl. It wasn’t until the boy’s friend said, “It would be pretty easy to get rid of her,” that they decided to actually carry out the brutal assault. \nAccording to social media messages between the boys, they had been planning the heinous crime for several weeks. \nThe report states the two teens were planning on slitting Turner’s throat before they decided to use a gun instead. Finally, on February 16, the boys lured Deserae Turner to a canal where they allegedly shot her in the back of her head. \nThey allegedly stole her backpack, her money and fled the scene as she laid in the ditch for several hours. She wasn’t found until the early morning hours on February 17. \nPolice first suspected Turner was solely targeted for her valuables, but recently discovered that was not the case. \nDetectives spoke to Deserae at her bedside in the hospital. After they explained to her what had happened and revealed that her so-called friends were responsible, she was said to be “in disbelief.” \nAs of right now, Turner is said to be fighting for her life at a hospital in Utah. \nThe two 16-year-old boys are currently being investigated for the crime. On May 8, a court hearing will decide whether or not one of the suspects will be charged as a juvenile or an adult. \nThe second suspect will have a preliminary hearing this month.
