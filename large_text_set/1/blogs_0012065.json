The experience did not live up to these high standards we set for ourselves.\"\nThe police department welcomed the rapid response from Krispy Kreme.\nThe incident occurred as a survey was published revealing that three quarters of all police officers believe their interactions with black people have become more tense following a number of police shootings of unarmed men.\nThe Pew Research Center poll also found a widespread view among police officers that the public misunderstood them, Reuters reported.\nTwo thirds of police officers said the killings of unarmed men were isolated problems. This contrasted with a separate Pew study which found that 60 percent of the general public thought the killings resulted from a broader, systemic problem.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:28:36.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
