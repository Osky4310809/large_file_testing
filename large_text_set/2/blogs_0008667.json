Since then, the Tab S3 LTE has received WiFi certification and Bluetooth certification, and the WiFi model just received its Bluetooth certification weeks ago. Just two weeks ago, the tablet’s specs and pricing were revealed , showing a 9.7-inch display, 2048 x 1536p screen resolution, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM, a 5MP front camera, and 12MP back camera. Now, a Galaxy Tab S3 photo has leaked, along with confirming much of what we know and adding some details in a new report. \nThe new report, supplied by Roland Quandt, says that Samsung will not release an 8-inch model this year — so there’ll be no “Galaxy Tab S3 9.7″ moniker, as has been the case with the Galaxy Tab S2, for example. There is an S Pen aboard, confirming the report we received a week ago , though it can’t be stored in the tablet itself (no Note tablet experience here, folks). Additionally, the Tab S3 will have a new Silver version that will replace the former white model (the tablet will retain its black color option) and come with 32GB of storage. Rounding out the specs is LTE Cat. 6 support, Gigabit WLAN, and Bluetooth 4.2. The pricing for the device comes in at around $600 USD. We’ve seen from Samsung’s MWC 2017 press invite that the Galaxy Tab S3 will feature a front-facing fingerprint sensor as well. \nWe’re sure that the news of an S Pen with the Tab S3 will appeal to a number of Samsung fans who’ve been wanting a Galaxy Note Tab upgrade. If you want to make it yours, however, you’ll have to wait just a little longer to get your hands on it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:48:24.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
