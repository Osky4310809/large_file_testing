At a show in Leeds, Drake assured the crowd that the project, which will be presented as an Apple Music playlist, was very close to completion. Tonight at his #BoyMeetsWorldTour show in Leeds, Drake said he's about 1 and a half to 2 weeks away from finishing #MoreLife . pic.twitter.com/eritJQcYWY â€” Word On Road (@WordOnRd) February 10, 2017 \n\"I'm excited because I'm about like a week and a half, two weeks away from finishing this project I'm working on called More Life ,\" he told the excited crowd. \"So you know what that means right? All that means is, I get to drop a new project, and at some point I get to come back and be with me people in Leeds one more motherfucking time.\" \nMore Life was originally set for release last December before being pushed back to \"early 2017.\" The previous update we received from Drake was in Amsterdam, when he told fans the playlist would be out before he returned to the city on his The Boy Meets World Tour February 26th. \nDrake has been teasing some new music from the upcoming project at his European tour dates.
