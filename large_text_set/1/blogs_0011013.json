(Photo: Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNicole Kidman has one piece of advice about President-elect Trump: It's time to support him. \n“I’m always reticent to start commenting politically; I’ve never done it in terms of America or Australia. I’m issue-based,” Kidman told the BBC while promoting her new movie, Lion . “So I just say, he’s now elected, and we as a country need to support whoever is the president because that’s what the country’s based on.” \nShe added: “Whatever, however, that happened, he’s there, and let’s go. For me, I'm very, very committed to women's issues.\" \nKidman was born in Hawaii to Australian parents and holds dual citizenship.

Violence incites violence,\" said Streep from the stage. \"When the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. This brings me to the press. We need the principle press to hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage.\" \nYou can watch Kidman's comments here.
