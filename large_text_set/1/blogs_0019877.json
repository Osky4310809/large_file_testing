MWC 2017 will take place from February 27-March 2, IFA 2017 is slated to take place from September 1-6, and in between those two trade shows is Google I/O , the company’s annual developer conference.\nGoogle I/O 2017 will take place at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California from May 17-19.\nHow did we find that out? While Google still has yet to reveal the dates and location to the general public, it did, however, send developers on a scavenger hunt earlier today. The end goal was to find the location of Google I/O, and apparently someone has just figured it out. The code was cracked thanks to a group of resourceful developers on this Discord channel .\n\nIt’s worth noting that the new Google I/O 2017 site is live, however, but there are no details to be seen at the moment. Google still has yet to reveal this information itself, but we’ll be sure to pass along any details as they arise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:01:29.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
