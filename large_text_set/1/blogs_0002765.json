At least, that’s what we learned from the newest installment of Billy on the Street , in which professional shouter-of-questions Billy Eichner interrogated New Yorkers—specifically, gay, male New Yorkers—to get their opinion of Oliver. And overwhelmingly, that was no opinion at all, with more than one participant asking, “Who is John Oliver?” \nEichner did manage to find a few passersby who were actually excited to meet the host in person—just not as excited as they were about, say, Wendy Williams or Taraji P. Henson (“Oh, she’s fierce”). Oliver might want to do more to get his name out there. I for one can’t wait for his guest spot on Empire . \nMarissa Martinelli is a Slate editorial assistant.
