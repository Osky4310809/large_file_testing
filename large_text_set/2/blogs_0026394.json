The team had blown a double-digit fourth-quarter lead, allowing the Philadelphia 76ers — without rookie standout Joel Embiid (knee) — to go up by one with just nine seconds left.\nIt was eerily similar to T.J. McConnell’s game-winning buzzer beater against New York in mid-January.\nBut then, Carmelo Anthony came to the rescue.\nGAME. #NYKvsPHI #Knicks pic.twitter.com/0P1uKdrmq5 \n— NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks) February 26, 2017 Anthony scored 37 points on 15-of-25 shooting to lift the Knicks, who were without Kristaps Porzingis (sprained ankle), to a 110-109 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday.\nNew York (24-35) still has a lot of work to do to climb back into the playoff race. The Knicks are currently five games behind the Detroit Pistons for the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference.\nBut Anthony’s play, which included 17 first-quarter points, will be critical if New York plans to make a late post-season push. The Knicks play the Toronto Raptors on Monday.\nIf they can get that win, it would be the first time the team strung two together since Dec. 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:56:30.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
