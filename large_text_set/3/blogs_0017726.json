The Secret Service would caution individuals to not jump to conclusions that may grossly mischaracterize the matter.”   \nNeither the president nor Donald Trump Jr. have commented on the incident. \nWhile these Secret Service agents likely didn’t mean any harm to the child, their actions appear to have been grossly unprofessional, to say the least. These agents are the people responsible for protecting one of the most — if not the most — targeted families in the entire world. Letting their guards down for even a split second could have been tragic. \nLike and share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you think these Secret Service agents acted unprofessionally by taking photographs of President Trump’s grandson while on duty.
