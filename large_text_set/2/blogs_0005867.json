Surrounded by his minions, Kaecilius and company perform a ritual in which they are seen beginning the process to summon Dormammu , the keeper of the Dark Dimension and Stephen Strange’s arch-nemesis. \nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson reflected on how tough certain scenes were to cut from the movie. \n“I really liked those scenes and I think everyone did a good job on them. [But] they weren’t hard to cut. We test the movie with and without theme,”Derrickson said. ‘It wasn’t just about the audience’s reaction, it was really how the movie felt.” \nDerrickson, the filmmaker behind Slither and The Exorcism of Emily Rose , reflected that the scenes they chose to cut helped create more power in the main story arc of the film. \n“Pauline Kael used to always talk about the director needing to know where the audience wants to be, and at that point of the movie, the audience didn’t want to be jumping around, they wanted to stay with Strange, who’s on this very interesting, very personal, and very dramatic journey,” said Derrickson. “The intrusion of those scenes was breaking up the soul of the movie in a way that just wasn’t necessary. We didn’t need it. When we removed them, we found that we lost very little, and we gained more power in the major arc of the character. So, it was a pretty easy choice in the end.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:29:26.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
