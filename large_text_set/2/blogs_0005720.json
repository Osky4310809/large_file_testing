Technically she was a part of a pre-game musical clip, but it was pretty much the best thing ever.\nOn Sunday, ahead of the Super Bowl festivities , FOX had a hilarious group of people team up and channel their inner Garth Brooks.\nCounty music fans all know that Brooks sings, “Friends in Low Places,” and now there is a football version of his song to jam along to.\nDuring the pre-show, Rob Riggle, who is a comedian and therefore funny by nature, kicked off the new version of “Friends in Low Places,” and we are forever grateful .\nThe performance included Bell, because she’s awesome, John Travolta, Aaron Paul, Weird Al Yankovich and more. It was really funny and joked about fans and celebrities who like teams that didn’t make it to the big game.\ntwitter.com From the beginning, Riggle revealed “I root for the Chiefs, that’s just my beliefs, and I’m bummed by season’s end.”\n“Like Garth in his song, today our teams don’t belong, but we’re going to love them anyways,” Paul sings alongside Riggle. For two teams the #SuperBowl is everything. The other 30 \"Lowly Teams\" are waiting & wishing. @RobRiggle explains. #RigglesPicks pic.twitter.com/Hva3ojVhuS \n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) February 5, 2017 “We love teams with lower draft picks,” another celeb pipes in, while wearing their favorite team’s gear.\nOur favorite moment is when Bell comes on screen in a sparkly ensemble for her Detroit Lions. Seriously, her glitter onesie is too awesome.\nThroughout the song, the stars honor the 30 teams that didn’t make it to the Super Bowl. Travolta however, is a diehard New England Patriots fans, so his tune was much happier. He tries to get everyone to root for his team, but they love their guys and can’t jump ship.\nCheck out the entire video above and try not to get this tune stuck in your head.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:39:48.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
