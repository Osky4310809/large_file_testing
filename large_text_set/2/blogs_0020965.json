At the time of his arrest, al-Britani claimed he was a hostage of the Taliban, and denied being an extremist. \nDespite his denials of involvement with the terrorist group, during his detention in Guantanamo, al-Britani reportedly provided U.S. interrogators with useful information about the Taliban’s tactics.
