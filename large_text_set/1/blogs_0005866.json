Akinwunmi Ambode for assent. \nLagos State has recorded recurrent cases of kidnappings, with the incident affecting students in two schools in 2016. \nIn February 2016, three schoolgirls were seized from Babington Macaulay Junior Seminary, Ikorodu, but were later freed by the police. \nIn October, gunmen stormed the Lagos Model College, Igbonla, Ikorodu, and took away the vice principal, a teacher and four students. \nThey were also after several days. \nKidnappers also stormed the palace of a traditional ruler, the Oniba of Iba, Yishau Goriola Oseni, in July and abducted him. \nHis release was later secured and several persons are on trial over the kidnap. \nThe House also adopted the recommendations of its Committee on Youths and Sports on a Bill for a Law to Provide for the Establishment of the Lagos State Sports Commission and for Connected Purpose after a debate. \nThe bill, seeking to create a commission for sports in the state to administer sporting activities, provides for the constitution of board members, duties and responsibilities, among others.
