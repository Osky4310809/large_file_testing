However, the surrogate babies, born at Masrani Hospital in Andheri, Mumbai, were premature. Needless to say, this meant that the health of the babies would be a concern moving forward, and Karan, like any other parent, has been concerned about the same. But, thanks to a competent and dedicated team of doctors, the babies have been well looked after, and are healthy. To thank his doctors, and offer hope and encouragement to other parents of premature babies, KJo wrote this heartfelt note: \"I have previously shared the wonderfully exciting news of the birth of my children, Roohi and Yash. None of the many overwhelming emotions that I am currently feeling as I take my baby steps into parenthood would have been possible without the marvels of medicine and the progress it has made today. Even the most anticipated events can sometimes leave us shaken, confused. And events that occur without any warning can turn our worlds on their very heads. My children were born two months premature and worryingly underweight. Like any person in this situation and on the brink of fatherhood, my heart sank. Knowing that there were complications with my babies' birth owing to how soon it was, I was terrified. All I wanted to do was hold them and protect them but they needed to be in the NICU. It was painful to see how tiny they were... Thankfully, I had a great support system. Roohi and Yash were in the hands of the most competent and patient doctors. Sometimes that had its roots in an ordeal, soon turned into an experience that I will never forget. With the guidance, support and solidarity of Dr. Avasthi and the unfailingly vigilant care he provided for the twins, they are both on their way to a happy and healthy childhood. As someone with a voice, I want to reach out. Millions of preemies are born every year... but babies are resilient. With the right kind of care, they stand just as good a chance of survival as anyone else. Organisations like Surya Hospital are stepping up during this time of need and reaching out to help. Via their campaign #SavePreemies, Surya Hospital aims to gather some goodwill and save as many preemies as possible. Having a premature baby is something you don't expect to happen to you. The whole experience has ignited a passion in me to help premature babies get the best chance they can... to help those in anguish who want the best of survival for their early born babies. Premature babies, when provided with the right kind of care, have just as good of a shot of making it, as babies born on time. If your baby is a preemie, don't be discouraged. Seek help. Wonderful organisations like Surya Hospital can nurture your child towards normal growth. If your baby is born premature, don't lose faith, don't lose heart. Brilliant doctors like Dr. Bhupendra Avasthi and Dr. Sonal Saste have dedicated their lives to this wonderful endeavour. I can only share my own experience and hope someone takes heart from it. I feel blessed to have had the care my children received while at the NICU and for all the prayers and support I had - but I urge anyone in the same situation to remember that your baby has the best chance of a long, happy life, too. Don't lose hope.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T11:17:07.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
