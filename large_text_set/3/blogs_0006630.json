He said the issue wasn’t so much with the city taking in refugees but with Louras’ secrecy about it. \nAccording to The Associated Press , Louras admitted a number of local issues played a role in his loss, but said that he felt his support for a refugee resettlement program cost him re-election.   \n“Though I wanted to think this was not a referendum on refugee resettlement , I continue to believe, as I’ve articulated, Rutland is a microcosm of the national conversation on immigration and refugees, and ultimately it was not an election on the issues but an election based on emotions,” the five-term incumbent said. \nAllaire agreed the refugee question was key. \n“Any time any kind of an issue like this comes up, my first stop is going to be with talking with the people and my colleagues and the city of Rutland.
