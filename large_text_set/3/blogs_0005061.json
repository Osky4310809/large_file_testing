According to Medical News Today: 18 \"[Y]oung adults who were given extra fruits and vegetables each day for 14 days ate more of the produce and experienced a boost in motivation and vitality.\" \nAmerican dietary guidelines suggest eating two cups of fruit and two to three cups of vegetables daily, but many fail to get even a fraction of this amount. In this study, the treatment group received two additional servings of fresh fruits and vegetables, including carrots, kiwi, apples and oranges each day for two weeks, while the control group continued their normal diet. \nThose who ate the most fruits and vegetables, averaging 3.7 servings per day, experienced the most pronounced improvements in psychological well-being, especially improvements in \"vitality, motivation and flourishing.\" According to the authors, \"Findings provide initial validation of a causal relationship between [fruits and vegetables] and well-being, suggesting that large-scale intervention studies are warranted.\" Sunlight and Vitamin D Also Affect Your Mental Health \nBesides diet, sunlight also has a profound impact on your mental health — more so than any other weather phenomenon. That was the conclusion of a recent study looking at links between weather and depression in a group of students. 19 It's been estimated 20 that as many as 20 percent of Americans are affected by Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) each winter, suffering from the blues, fatigue and in some cases, more serious depression, as sunlight grows scarce. \nWhat differentiates SAD from regular depression is that a full remission occurs in the spring and summer months. Indeed, as the days got shorter through fall and winter, self-reports of depression rose, whether the student had been diagnosed with SAD or not. According to the authors: \n\"These findings suggest the need for institutions and public health entities to plan for intervention and prevention resources and strategies during periods of reduced sun time.\" \nThe researchers note that more research is needed to evaluate related factors such as vitamin D intake, amount of time actually spent outdoors and sunbed use. Indeed, vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with a higher risk of depression. \nFor example, research has shown having a vitamin D level below 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) can raise your risk for depression by as much as 85 percent, compared to having a vitamin D level greater than 30 ng/mL. A number of studies have also confirmed that adequate levels of vitamin D can help alleviate symptoms of depression. 21 One of the mechanisms is thought to be vitamin D's anti-inflammatory properties, which again hints at inflammation being a root cause of depression. \nA study published in 2015, 22 which looked at healthy women aged 18 to 25 who lived in the Pacific Northwest during the fall, winter and spring, found that vitamin D insufficiency (30 ng/ml or lower) could predict the emergence of clinically significant depressive symptoms. The link remained even after controlling for factors such as season, body mass index, race, diet, exercise and time spent outdoors. How Sunlight Can Influence Your Mood \nVitamin D cannot account for all of the mental health benefits associated with sunlight, though. According to a paper published in the journal Dermato Endocrinology, 23 a large number of light-absorbing molecules (chromophores) found in the different layers of your skin absorb and interact with ultraviolet rays, producing a number of complex and synergistic effects. \nI am strongly convinced this benefit is not just from UVB exposure that generates vitamin D but also red, near-, mid- and far-infrared light. The intensity of the light is also a large factor as it is far brighter outside than indoors. There are additional chromophores in your mitochondria electron transport chain that respond to near-infrared. This complex stimulus of sunlight affects not only your physical health by preventing diseases, it also impacts your mood and mental health. For example: \n• Your body uses the near-infrared light spectrum to produce mitochondrial energy and maintain systemic equilibrium. Knowing this, it seems reasonable to conclude that if you're running low on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) — cellular energy — due to insufficient amounts of sunlight exposure, you'd start feeling sluggish and tired, and possibly depressed. \n• Sunlight also regulates your circadian rhythm, and light therapy has been shown to be effective against both SAD and non-seasonal major depression. When it's dark, your melatonin levels increase, which is why you may feel tired when the sun starts to set. In the heart of winter, this may be at as early as 4 p.m. \n• Ultraviolet (UV) light also stimulates epidermal cells known as keratinocytes to make beta-endorphins, which have a mood-boosting effect. \n• Serotonin is also released in response to sunlight, which helps elevate your mood and energy. \n• UVA generates nitric oxide (NO) in your skin, which influences your body in a number of beneficial ways. It stimulates up to 60 percent of your blood to flow to your skin capillaries where the blood absorbs UV and infrared radiation, which can structure water in your body. \nAdditionally, the UVA actually helps kill any infections in your blood while the infrared recharges your cellular battery. NO also lowers inflammation, which could have a beneficial impact on your mental health seeing how depression is strongly linked to chronic, low-grade inflammation . Magic Mushrooms — a Game Changer for Severe Anxiety and Depression? \nInterestingly, mounting research suggests psilocybin , also known as magic mushrooms, may be a game changer in the treatment for severe depression and anxiety. Between 80 and 90 percent of cancer patients in two separate studies achieved immediate and long-lasting relief from anxiety and fear of death from a single dose. A major part of this remarkable recovery appears to be related to the spiritual intensity of the experience. \nApart from the spiritual reconnection itself, the feeling of love and being \"one\" with everything also appears to result in alterations in the brain — a mechanism ascribed to neuroplasticity, where your brain actually changes in accordance to experience. A majority of the participants ranked it among \"the most meaningful\" experiences of their lives, which in turn resulted in a feeling that everything has purpose, including their own struggles. \nIn my view, it is lack of life meaning and lack of connection to something larger than ourselves that pervades the lives of so many these days, and the answer is not to shut down or mask your emotions with a pill. The relief you seek is more likely to be found through careful soul searching and implementation of strategies to boost your emotional resilience , which can include non-denominational meditation and spiritual practices according to your own proclivities and spiritual bend. \nPsilocybin is presently classified as an illegal drug and cannot be used as a psychiatric treatment outside of research, but this could potentially change in the future. Until then, I would encourage you to seek out those things that add meaning and purpose to your life. \nAlso remember that depression and other mental health problems are typically rooted in gut dysfunction and chronic inflammation, so addressing your diet is a foundational step for long-term healing and mental health. Sensible sun exposure can also play an important role. Getting adequate sleep and exercise are two additional lifestyle factors that may need to be addressed. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T08:40:09.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
