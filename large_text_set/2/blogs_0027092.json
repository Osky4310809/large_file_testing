The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.3 percent (its fifth straight session of declines), the S&P 500 index fell 3.5 percent and the Nasdaq ​ fell by 3.9 percent. Markets fell the most since the day trading resumed after 9/11. (See also: The 2007-2008 Financial Crisis In Review . ) \nAt the time, journalists ascribed the decline to a decline in Chinese shares and signs of economic weakness. The latter manifested in new home sales, which “tumbled” by 16 percent as compared to the previous year. The National Association of Realtors also said that the median home price had dropped by 3.1 percent as compared to the previous year. A government report released that morning showed a 3% decline in sales of nondefense durable orders (or goods expected to last three years or more) as compared to the previous year. \nHowever, in hindsight it was an ominous announcement by Freddie Mac that it would no longer buy the most risky of subprime loans that was the most impactful news of the day for the housing market and the nation’s economy. (See also: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac And The Credit Crisis Of 2008 ). \nThe screws were already tightening around subprime lending companies, and by February of 2007, more than 20 subprime companies had already been forced to shut down. After Freddie made its announcement, conditions for housing finance worsened and a tidal wave of failures began enveloping the entire financial sector, cresting about a year later with the failures of Countrywide and Bear Sterns. \nThen Fed Chair Ben Bernanke assured Congress that the markets were “working well” and that the steep market declines a day earlier were an anomaly. “If the housing sector begins to stabilize and if some of the inventory corrections that are still going on in manufacturing begin to be completed, there is a reasonable possibility of strengthening of the economy sometime during the middle of the year,” he told them.
