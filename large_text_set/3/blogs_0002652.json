You can clearly see the size difference between these two devices, and decide which one you would want to buy as per your comfort. \nThese images appear to come from a screen protector manufacturer, offering a clear look at both the devices. The Galaxy S8 ‘s screen comes with the Always-On Display feature and a persistent on-screen home button. Above the new bezel-less display, there are a bunch of sensors along with the front-facing camera and the iris scanner. \nOn the top, the phone has a SIM card tray and a secondary microphone. There’s a USB Type-C port, loudspeaker, and a 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom. These images offer us the clearest look at the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus to date. Which device would you opt for?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T19:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:24:41.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
