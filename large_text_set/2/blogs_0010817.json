The alleged Huawei P10 is expected to be launched at a pre-MWC event on February 26th . Even before its launch though, we’ve got some exclusive, clear renders of the Huawei P10 in collaboration with @OnLeaks . There’s also a 360-degree video of the same render. \nThe Huawei P10 is expected to come with a 5.2-inch display and will roughly have dimensions of 145.5 x 69.5 x 7.35mm. The home-button (possibly also including the fingerprint scanner) has now been moved to the front below the display. To jog your memory, the P9 didn’t have a home button and the fingerprint scanner was mounted on the rear. The placement of the Leica-branded dual cameras remains the same; the two cameras, along with the flash module and what we think is a laser autofocus setup, all are lined up on a horizontal strip which is of a slightly different colour than the phone itself. Speaking of which, the colours in these renders are purely representational and do not necessarily reflect those of the retail unit. Huawei P10 renders 1 of 9 \nOn closer inspection, you will notice that this time around, the edges are rounded, which does make the P10 look a lot like the iPhone 6. Similarly, it looks like the the antenna bands now run along the top and the bottom edges making the design far more streamlined. At the bottom edge, you will find a USB Type-C port, a 3.5mm jack, and the speaker grille – the setup is fairly unchanged from the P9. The power button and the volume rocker are placed on the right edge. \nWhile we’ve waxed eloquent on the design of the Huawei P10, recent leaks have also revealed a lot about the specifications of the phone. As per a recently leaked promotional poster, the Huawei P10 is expected to arrive in three variants – 4GB RAM + 32GB storage, 4GB RAM + 64GB storage and 6GB RAM + 128GB storage. These variants will be priced according to the leak at RMB 3,488 (~Rs 34,170), RMB 4,088 (~Rs 40,000) and RMB 4,688 (~Rs 45,930) respectively. \nThe leak also claims that the phone will come in a Plus variant called the Huawei P10 Plus. This variant will supposedly be available in two configurations: 4GB RAM + 64GB storage and 6GB RAM + 128GB storage, priced at RMB 4,988 (~Rs 48,870) and RMB 5,688 (~Rs 55,730) respectively. \nThe P10 Plus, unlike the P10, will apparently sport a 5.5-inch curved display. The phones are expected to be powered by HiSilicon Kirin 960 processors, and will include Leica-branded 12MP rear cameras, 8MP selfie shooters, Iris scanners, Harman Kardon audio technology, fingerprint sensors and Android Nougat.
