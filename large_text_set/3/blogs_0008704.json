No one knows that better than Landry Jones , who will be looking to extend his track record of occasional starts after re-signing with the Steelers on a 2-year deal, the team announced Thursday afternoon .\nJones has started four games the past two seasons, going 2-2 in relief of Roethlisberger during the regular season. The former Oklahoma standout has spent his entire career in Pittsburgh after being drafted by the organization in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft . He didn’t attempt a pass his first two seasons with the club, but was pressed into action in 2015 and performed capably for a backup.\nWhile Jones is the cause of too many turnovers — his career touchdown-to-interception rate is just 7:6 — he’s a dependable backup who could one day graduate to Roethlisberger’s role once the Pro Bowl quarterback finally retires. His 86.3 passer rating last fall would have qualified as the league’s 21st-best mark among starters.\nHowever, those numbers may be inflated by the level of competition he’s faced. 50 percent of his starts and 100 percent of his wins have come against the Browns . Outings against the Chiefs and Patriots led to double-digit defeats.\nJones will be 28 years old next season, but has improved in each year as a professional. The Steelers are hoping that development will continue, potentially priming the former Heisman Trophy candidate for a shot at the starting job once Roethlisberger eventually retires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:50:58.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
