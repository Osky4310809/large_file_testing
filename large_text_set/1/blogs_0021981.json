Two university-age sons living with him and his wife in London also defected with him. \nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North, which is subject to U.N. sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs, regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States. \nThae is the most senior official to have fled North Korea and entered public life in the South since the 1997 defection of Hwang Jang Yop, the brains behind the North’s governing ideology, “Juche”, which combines Marxism and extreme nationalism. \nToday’s North Korean system had “nothing to do with true communism”, Thae said, adding that the elite, like himself, had watched with unease as countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and the former Soviet Union embraced economic and social reforms. \nThae has said that more North Korean diplomats are waiting in Europe to defect to South Korea. \nNorth Korea still outwardly professes to maintain a Soviet-style command economy, but for years a thriving network of informal markets and person-to-person trading has become the main source of food and money for ordinary people. \nFully embracing these reforms would end Kim Jong Un’s rule, Thae said. Asked if Kim Jong Un’s brother, Kim Jong Chol, could run the country instead, Thae remained skeptical. \n“Kim Jong Chol has no interest in politics. He is only interested in music,” Thae said. \n“He’s only interested in Eric Clapton. If he was a normal man, I’m sure he’d be a very good professional guitarist”.
