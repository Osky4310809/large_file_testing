King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 12 hours ago 4 \nDokken guitarist George Lynch, whose daughter was once engaged to As I Lay Dying guitarist Nick Hipa, said that Tim Lambesis is out of jail. \nAs widely reported, Lambesis was convicted to 6 years in prison for hiring a hitman to murder his wife. The singer was convicted in February 2014, meaning he served half of his sentence and that there's a chance for him to be eligible for parole. \nAnyhow, Lynch told Eddie Trunk : \"[Lambesis] just got out of jail for attempting to kill his wife. Now I'm not saying this as an indictment against anything. \n\"All I'm saying is, there is a guy who could argue Christianity beyond anybody I've ever spoken to in my life; I had these very heated debates with this guy... He had a beautiful wife; they had adopted three Cambodian children. And then he discovered cocaine, strippers, heroin and steroids. He went completely off the rails, abandoned his family, his wife threatened to divorce him, he hired an off-duty cop to kill her. \n\"He recently got out of jail. He destroyed his band. They don't have a pot to piss in now; they're all struggling. They are a great band. I know them very well because the guitar player was my daughter's fiance. And the drummer [Jordan Mancino] played in another project I had ways back, Souls of We. \n\"So, anyways, he's out, he's got a mega record deal, he's got a book deal, everything's lined up for him. I mean, he's gonna skate through life. Everybody else is suffering. His wife is living in fear, his children are living in fear. His band doesn't have a pot to piss in.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T12:33:44.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
