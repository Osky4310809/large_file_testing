The singer and blogger, currently based in London, is gearing up to release an upcoming album, while here she wears labels from the likes of Alessandra Rich, Staud, VETEMENTS, Philosophy, Vans and Ermanno Scervino.\nWe asked Patricia a handful of questions in order to get to know her a little better. See what she had to say below and check out our previous installment with Iva Varvarchuk . Keep up with Patricia through Instagram .\nWho or what are you currently inspired by? \nI’m inspired by people’s stories. I observe a lot and I listen so much. Empathy has always helped me in songwriting.\nWhat is the thing that gets you out of bed each morning? \nUsually the noise out of my apartment in London. I love living in hectic places, it keeps me going.\nTell us about your day to day. \nI wake up and the first thing I do is check my emails. I drink about 5 to 7 espressos per day to keep my energy up. During my day, I either write, have photoshoots, am in the studio or traveling.\nIf you weren’t doing what you are now, where would you work? \nI would probably have a strategic marketing consultancy company. I went to business school and marketing is what I’m best at.\nWhich Emoji best represents you? \nThe alien because of some features on my face.\nWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received? \nBe the main character in your own movie.\nLast lesson you learned? \nDon’t reveal too much of yourself to people.\nWhat is the quality you value most in friendship? \nLoyalty. In the good and in the bad.\nWhat is the greatest accomplishment of your life so far? \nFinishing university while working at the same time.\nWhat album do you currently have on repeat? \nMine. It’s in mastering right now.\nWhat is your most treasured item of clothing? \nMy Saint Laurent suede boots because they’re the first thing I bought with my own money yet I still called mom before to ask her.\nWhat is your fondest memory? \nWhen I was a kid, I was convinced I had been part of my parents’ wedding. It was beautiful, I remembered every single detail. It turned out in time that it had been a dream and it never happened. It still feels so real to me and it still is my fondest memory.\nWhat skill do you possess that people wouldn’t expect from you? \nI am kind of a hacker and a computer nerd. I could pretty much do anything both on a PC and on a Mac.\nWhat could you eat every day and not get tired of? \nObviously spaghetti.\nWhere do you want to be in the next five years? \nIn a great creative space.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:44:43.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
