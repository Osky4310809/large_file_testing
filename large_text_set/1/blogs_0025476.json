Own options \nMinisters had intended to use the same boundaries as the seven local health boards, but councils will instead be asked to offer their own options. \nIn addition, councils will be grouped into three regions - south-east Wales, south-west and central Wales, and north Wales - to work together on developing the economy and on transport. \nDecisions will be taken by joint committees of councillors, with the authorities pooling their budgets. \nMr Drakeford said: \"This white paper is not about change for change's sake. \n\"Our councils are working against a backdrop of extraordinary austerity and some services are facing a great deal of pressure. \n\"Local government reform is essential if we're to make these services stronger and more resilient to cope with the demands of the future.\" Image caption The 22 councils had been facing plans to merge to as few as eight or nine authorities \nMore powers over elections - including the voting age - are being devolved to Cardiff Bay. \nThe Welsh Government said it was seeking views on letting councils choose between first-past-the-post or Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections. \nVoters rank candidates in order of preference in STV elections. The system is used in local elections in Northern Ireland and Scotland. \nMr Drakeford said he wanted to see a \"new relationship\" between councils and the public - and between councils and the Welsh Government. Departure \nPlans by his predecessor Leighton Andrews to merge authorities angered some council leaders . \nThe contents of the white paper, first outlined by Mr Drakeford in the autumn, is a departure from the advice of a high-level commission which recommended mergers in January 2014. \nThe Williams Commission called for fewer, bigger councils and criticised the complexity of the public sector. \nYears of pressure from ministers for services to collaborate had resulted in \"multiple overlapping and layered partnerships with unclear governance which often added little value and blurred lines of accountability\", it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T08:45:39.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
