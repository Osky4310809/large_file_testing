We’re keeping everybody informed, taking feedback and we’re almost ready. Soon. Once we have a report, you’ll get the report. Soon. We’re very close.”\nBut panel member Herbert Sturz, chairman of the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, confirmed that “the report will support the closing of Rikers.”\n“Some of the people there will be on supervised release,” said Sturz, a former deputy mayor and Planning Commission chairman under then-Mayor Edward Koch.\n“We want to make the bail system fair.”\nSEE ALSO \nCity Council speaker wants to shut down Rikers Island 0:0 City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito went to the mat for... Lippman convened his Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform last year at the request of City Council Speaker Mark Viverito, who has called for Rikers to be shut down , a position endorsed by Gov. Cuomo. Earlier last year, de Blasio publicly rejected the idea of closing Rikers, calling it a “noble concept” but saying it would cost “billions and billions of dollars” and leave the city with nowhere to lock up its hordes of jailbirds.\nIt was unclear whether de Blasio would adopt the commission’s recommendations, but the mayor has hired two teams of consultants to draw up plans to transform Rikers. according to a source familiar with their work.\nOne team, from HR&A Advisors, has been developing a proposal that includes replacing the jail complex with a third runway for La Guardia Airport, a sewage-treatment plant and a garbage transfer station, the source said.\nThat team was told to clear their calendars for Sunday, the source said.\nThe other consultants are identifying potential locations for the new jails that would distribute the inmates evenly across the boroughs, the source said.\nPursuing that plan would be politically perilous, as shown by the fate of former Staten Island Borough President Ralph Lamberti, who cut a failed deal to put a jail in the Rossville neighborhood in exchange for the closure of homeless shelter.’\nLamberti, a Democrat, was ousted in 1989 by Republican Guy Molinari, who pounded him on the issue.\nDe Blasio, Mark-Viverito and Lippman all declined comment following their meeting.\nAdditional reporting by Aaron Short and Bruce Golding \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:48:57.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
