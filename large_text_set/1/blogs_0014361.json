On stage, Katherine Parkinson (The IT Crowd) has just flipped over a naked Rufus Jones (W1A) — playing her sexually reticent husband — to give the audience a wobbly full-frontal beginning to spirited farce Dead Funny. The woman responsible for this hilarious, wince-inducing scene is Emma Brünjes. \nThe 35-year-old West End producer counts the all-star comedy among a clutch of eye-catching productions staged since she set up her eponymous business three years ago. \nAs comedy big-hitters Ralf Little (The Royle Family) and Steve Pemberton (The League of Gentlemen) stride about, pretending to be erstwhile comedy heroes Frankie Howerd and Benny Hill, it’s clear that staging this Terry Johnson-written rerun took some clout. \n“It’s such a fun green room, they’re a great cast,” she tells me in her corner office in Covent Garden, where she dubs her largely female clan the Ladies of Maiden Lane. \nThe glass box is littered with memorabilia. A poster for Frank Skinner’s 2007 comeback tour sits above her head — the pair bonded singing Annie show tunes on a flight to Cannes; a tape dispenser in the shape of a high-heeled shoe is in reach. Her black Cavapoo puppy, Etta, looks on plaintively outside (“she sticks to Emma like Velcro,” says a colleague). \nClout is something the youthful Brightonian has plenty of. Her route to the West End started in, um, the West End. \nWhile her fellow London School of Economics graduates “turned left and got proper jobs” in the Square Mile, Brünjes had one eye up the road, ushering at the Royal Opera House before producing on Broadway. \nJoining management firm Avalon as a junior marketing assistant on £15,000, she was made promotions head at a staggering 25 and, after a lot of Augusts spent surviving Edinburgh furnishing her little black book, was taken under the wing of theatre producer Nica Burns. \nTreasuring Burns’ tutelage, she struck out alone three years later to make the most of her ideas and contacts book — agreeing to take some work, including the Edinburgh Comedy Awards, with her. “I’ll never forget waking up thinking ‘what have I done?’ Then I just drank tea with people for what seemed like months.” \nHer mum claims her business nous was clear early on, recently recalling Brünjes organising her three brothers into shows, making programmes and selling her parents drinks from their fridge on childhood holidays in Spain. Her youngest sibling, cricket-mad Ralph, is now her commercial director — the pair created their ticketing business in their pyjamas at home. \nThe pint-sized entrepreneur’s defining work was Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, a sprawling production in The Vaults under Waterloo station, which could’ve tanked the business. \nOn opening night, Brünjes was dolled up, ready to take her guests down the rabbit hole when a power cut threw punters and critics into darkness in the collection of tunnels. \n“One of our actors said that improvising for [celebrated critic] Lyn Gardner for 45 minutes should have won him an Olivier award in itself,” Brünjes grimaces. “[Despite powering back up] I went to bed and cried my eyes out. This was my biggest, flag-waving project which said ‘I’m happy to be brave and bold’ and I thought it was game over, career suicide.” \nThankfully, the first two months were already sold out and the “ok” reviews were backed by strong word of mouth — 95,000 people saw it in five months, and a reboot is planned for April. \n“We delivered a 29% return to investors over nine months, which is pretty healthy,” says the self-confessed “spreadsheet queen”. An Olivier Award nomination followed, with the ceremony ironically staged at the Royal Opera House (“I still know some of the ushers!”). \nTwo other immersive shows have followed. Brünjes ate “worm spaghetti” staging an eat-along version of Roald Dahl’s The Twits and hosted Sherlock-inspired detective experience The Game’s Afoot at Madame Tussauds. \nShe insists “we are not [specialists] Punchdrunk. I love that kind of visceral work but it’s high-risk and I don’t just want to do one thing”. \nRaconteur shows with cricket legends Henry Blofeld, David Gower and Graeme Swann are on the books, as is a new play snapped up when Nicholas Hytner left the National. \nAway from the West End, Brünjes is a handy golfer. “I have actually done two quite major bits of business on the golf course — that glass ceiling is coming down!” It’s a rare nod to convention from a businesswoman keen to break the mould.
