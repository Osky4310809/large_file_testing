Conditions will also be placed on his contract relating to integrity matters following the review of his gambling associations last year.” \nIt has been reported that one of the conditions for Foran to make his return to the NRL is that he must cut all ties with controversial punter Eddie Hayson . \nNRL officials had reservations about his ongoing relationship with Hayson which had been part of the reason for the delay in the former Parramatta Eel being cleared to return. \nIn the NRL release, Mr Doyle said Foran had made significant progress since joining the Vodafone Warriors last year and the club continues to provide internal and external support \n“Naturally, we are keen to see Kieran back on the field as soon as possible but we have always shared the NRL’s view that the most important thing is to ensure Kieran is mentally and physically ready for the demands of the NRL,” Mr Doyle said. \n“We have seen Kieran’s progress over the last few months and we are confident he will ready for Round Three. Kieran Foran has been training with the Warriors for months. Source: Supplied \n“Kieran has already become an integral part of the Warriors squad off the field and his team mates will be thrilled to see him back on the field.” \nForan said he was delighted that his contract had been registered. \n“Naturally I would love to return in Round One because I love Rugby League and I love being part of the Warriors squad,” he said. \n“But both the Warriors and NRL have put my welfare first throughout so I am just happy that my contract is registered and I now have a date for my return.” \nIn April last year Kieran Foran was rushed to hospital suffering from a drug overdose in an attempt to take his own life. \nIn an interview last year with the Daily Telegraph Foran said he had taken a batch of left over pills that were painkilling medication . \n“I remember the week vividly,” Foran said. \n“I had been struggling, I had a lot going on. Trying to work through my relationship breakdown, with two young kids, with my ex-partner, while juggling football. I just wasn’t coping. I could see I was starting to lose hope on life, really. I just couldn’t see that light at the end of the tunnel. I just remember one late Thursday night it all got too much for me. Foran’s career with the Eels was short-lived. Source: News Corp Australia \n“I can’t remember the exact amount (of pills I took). It was a handful. I remember getting told the next day by the nurses that it wasn’t enough to kill me but definitely enough to make me crook. At the time I was hoping that it was gonna do the job. I’m grateful I’m here today, but I remember waking up the next morning wishing that it had worked.” \nLeading up to Foran’s attempt to take his life was the breakdown of his relationship with the mother of his two children, Rebecca Pope. \n“Rebecca is the mother of my two kids and I will always love her for that,” he said last year. \n“We have been together since we were 19. We wanted to start a young family. Obviously we had the intentions of growing old together and being together for 50-odd years. But we hit some roadblocks. Like all relationships you have your ups and your downs. \n“Ours was no different. Going through what I was going through at the time, and what I was suffering from, it made it all that more difficult. We tried to work through our issues but couldn’t.” View All Comments  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:15:21.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
