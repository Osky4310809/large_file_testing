Yogi Berra?\nNo, no, Yogi Nath.\nOh, that Yogi Nath? The one who does all that service?\nYes, yes, that Nath. Yogi Adityanath.\nHoney, cover yourself with a chaadar, end-to-end. UP’s moral police is here.\nNot just UP’s, but India’s. Narendra Modi ascended to the top, hid his fangs, gained international and national approval. The man who he covered up in the general election campaign, Yogi Nath, has now been bared for all to see.\nActually, Mr. Modi has been bared for all to see. The King-Emperor doesn’t have any clothes. Did he ever actually?\nUP has two-thirds the population of the US, just more than Pakistan’s, and roughly twice that of Japan. He who wins UP wins India. Even though Jinnah hailed from Gujarat, the UP Muslims, then-called Hindustani Muslims, were instrumental in creating Pakistan.\nUPiites in the recent election have demonstrating their fatigue with cycling and building elephant statue. And Rahulji wears such a potent crowd-repellent that it never fails to work. So why not give a shot to the Sanghis.\nMaybe they will clean up the Ganges after all. Perhaps law and order too will improve. But, lo, first things first. Kill romance. Holding hands in public is out. Not between man and man, or woman and woman, for those are old Indian traditions, but between man and woman.\nDidn’t realize that Yogi Nath thought humans procreate through palms. Ag, got it. This is the most efficacious way of controlling the state’s burgeoning population. Well, then, I am all for it. All other states in India must follow suit, asap.\nBut hitting the exhibitionist couple with a bamboo stick? Is that on? Why not. In Saudi Arabia and Iran they use a leather cane. Ouch!\nAlso, didn’t realize that realize that Yogi Nath believed in Christian ways. Pope Francis is tolerant towards homosexuality. Well, if the pope seems to condone homosexuality, can Yogiji be far behind. Come on, all members of the same sex, hold hands all you want.\nSecond step. No more meat. Shut down all these abattoirs. Hey, but we thought that the national consensus was moving towards no beef. Now no mutton, no chicken, no pork?\nNo, no, we are closing down only illegal abattoirs. But note, all abattoirs are illegal in our opinion. I see, a particular community is kept busy in abattoirs, and you want them out in the open, living on love and fresh air. Not love, you sicko, but fresh air is good.\nBut what about the troops? What troops, idiot? The one’s in the morning shaakhaa? No, no, not those ones with the handsome knobby knees. So handsome that they now have to wear long pants to hide their shame.\nI mean the macho guys, the Indian army. Doesn’t the Indian army encourage meat consumption? I thought so. One of my earliest memories is of goats being slaughtered in my father’s army regiment on its raising day function, and a soldier barbecuing a pig, and handing me a chunky, juicy hunk of meat from it.\nBut being vegetarian gets you all the nutrients. Sure it does, and it is perhaps healthier too, but meat gives protein more intensely and other nutrients like Omega 3s that are hard to come by in veggies.\nWhat nonsense, I say, exclaims Yogi Nath. Look at me. How strong and sturdy I am. All on a tasty diet of cow cola and cow dung. Sure, have your way. Morarji Desai lived more than 100 on a liquid diet of his own liquid, but, somehow that way is way too much for me. Yucky yuck!\nAnd see the Pakistanis. They are a good head taller than us Indians. How dare you bring up those rascals, yells the Yogi. I, and my moral police, can take them on single-handedly. Ok, ok, with laathis. What do you think we do for three hours every morning from four to seven.\nGot it. I won’t bring up those rascals. Let’s consider our own rascals. The Rajputs, famous for their valour, grow so tall and athletic on their lal maas. The Gurkhas, the bravest of the brave, are natural carnivores. And even if orthodox Sikhs are supposed to be veggie, many Sikhs love their tandoori chicken.\nAs do many of us in UP. As we love our rogan josh. Why deny the taste of heaven to us? No, no, in my rule, any pleasure will cease. After all, Narendra Bhai lives on thepla and water. But didn’t his supporters just proclaim him Gujarat ka Sher. And as far as I know the lions of Gir are pure carnivores.\nStop all this sickular hogwash. The viceroy of India, Shahji, has not appointed me Mukhya Mantri of the most important state of India for nothing. Oh, you mean Shahji as in Shah Jehan? You, you, you are so sick that if you ever set foot in my state, I’ll, I’ll…..\nOk, ok, Yogiji, don’t go red, or more aptly, purple, in the face. I mean people will only come to your state if there are roads and pavements there. I thought that that would have been your first order of business, but like Donald Trumped, you seem to have veered on-course.\nWhat next, Yogiji? Well, we are going to get rid of this phoren language of slavery, English. But Yogiji, the bada cyclist tried that, and look where it got him. He thought he was going to become PM of India, but the chotta cyclist chucked him out, so out on his ear, that he seems out forever. Just like Harbhajan Singh from the Indian cricket team.\nAnd then I plan to change the medium of instruction in all schools, even in that heretic La Martiniere, into Sanskrit. But Yogiji, doesn’t La Martiniere provide a sound moral education. What nonsense! All conversion in the name of teaching. Just like Mother T.\nAnd then I think we’ll cover the Taj Mahal with a black cloth. Monument to love they say, eh? No more luv-shuv in my state. But Yogiji, Agra depends upon the Taj Mahal. Well, we’ll open gau-shaalaas (cow-shelters) in the chaar-baagh (the gardens). Tourists can come and try fresh milk, cow cola, and cow dung. That’ll take care of Agra.\nSo innovative, Yogiji, so innovative. I never knew that you were so innovative. And then I am going to ban inter-religious marriage in UP. But Yogiji, that is allowed by the Constitution of India.\nConstitution, you said, constitution. No such thing as constitution-wonstitution. In UP, we are going to have our own Constipation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T08:58:49.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
