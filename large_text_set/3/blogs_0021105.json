Forex (FX) is the market where currencies are traded, and it's the largest, most liquid market in the world. Average traded values can be in the trillions on a daily basis, and includes all the currencies in the world. \nThe forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for holidays--and any firm, person or country can participate. That means forex is naturally a dynamic, extremely fast-paced world and its open nature means you could make serious earnings--if you take learning about the market seriously. \nHere's three essential tips for getting into forex: 1. Find a broker you can trust. \nYou'll want the money you're sending to be safe, so you need to find a broker or large market maker that's regulated in at least one (preferably two) countries. The larger and more stable the market maker, the more stable their trading platforms and servers. Plus, you want a broker with a large number of employees to help assist you with trades when the market is active. 2. Find a trading platform that works for you. \nPlay around with your broker's software by opening a demo account or virtual trading account. That way, you can see if the functionality of the software works for you. Additionally, you can test it using virtual money, not your own funds. 3. Research, study and learn. \nAlways make sure your trades are built on a strong foundation of research. Avoid the bad practice of making trades impulsively. Forex is a technical market, so technical analysis is your best friend in understanding FX--keep up to date on developments in the market, which can be as easy as setting up news alerts from the Internet. \nYou can also learn more about Forex using trainings like this New York Forex Institute Training & Certification Course .
