The pair cuddled up in bed (Photo: bearzy1/snapchat) Are they dating? (Photo: Instagram/charlottegshore) \nA source exclusively told The Sun Online: “Bear kept the Snapchat up for around 15 minutes before deleting it. \n“He was giggling about the toothpaste on his face and Charlotte cuddled up to him the whole way through.” \nDespite their cuddly behaviour, Charlotte denied recently that she was enjoying a romance with the notorious womaniser. \nShe told Heat magazine: “We’re just very good friends. Just good friends. We spent a lot of time together, but that was just filming 16 hours a day for Just Tattoo of Us. \n“When we were filming, we were constantly play-fighting with each other, or doing something to wind each other up,” she added. Charlotte has previously denied the claims (Photo: Instagram/charlottegshore) \nThe romance rumours are a far cry from reports late last year that the reality pair weren't seeing eye-to-eye on set of the show. \nA source had told The Sun: “Charlotte and Bear have not been seeing eye to eye on their new show. Charlotte finds Bear annoying and unprofessional. She doesn't think he has earned his fame. \n“A lot of people think she is finding it difficult to share the limelight with him after hosting a TV series on her own in the past.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T16:20:36.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
