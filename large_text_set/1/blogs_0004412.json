King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 10 hours ago 4 Max Cavalera recently criticized fans and artists who live in the past, singling out bands that in his opinion prove the scene is \"as good as it was 30 years ago.\"The musician tells Aggressive Tendencies : \"It's really cool to see people pushing the envelope, carry the fire.\"When you look at a band like Full of Hell, they're insane! They're totally pushing the boundaries, especially when they went on tour with The Body. It was ridiculous, a sonic assault on all turns! It's very inspiring.\"After his brother Igor noted he sees that same fire and attitude he and Max had in the early days in these young bands, Max added:\"I think the same spirit is alive when you search for bands. When I find something I like, I want to get in touch with them, get their shirts, represent them. Like the Homewrecker. That's the underground spirit.\"It's a choice. You can let that die and be like one of these guys that get old and don't like anything new, just live from the past. 'Oh, the old glory days!' Fuck the glory days! This is the glory days! This is as good as it was 20 or 30 years ago!\"The frontman further added: \"I saw a Nails video I thought was really cool - the making of their new album. And the drummer said the whole inspiration for him was Igor's drumming on ' Arise ,' and that's so cool to hear!\"\"No money can buy that!\", Igor chimed in.Max continued, \"And then you go and listen to the album, 'You Will Never Be One of Us,' and it's so sick! It's very inspiring for us to hear stuff like that.\"If you want to check the bands out, you can do it below.
