(Photo: Marvel) \nThe Blu-ray and digital releases include five behind-the-scenes featurettes, including looks at costumes, set design, fight choreography and Michael Giacchino’s original score. Also on tap: a gag reel, audio commentary by director Scott Derrickson and five deleted scenes — one features Mads Mikkelsen’s villain Kaecilius and another has Strange meeting Daniel Drumm (Mark Anthony Bryant), a character with strong ties to comic-book lore. \nIn addition, the Doctor Strange release offers a bunch of extras that tie into the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe. A digital-exclusive featurette explores how Marvel grounds its films in real science, there’s a “Phase 3” sneak peek at upcoming films including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , Thor: Ragnarok , Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War , and a mockumentary short continuing the misadventures of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his Australian roommate Darryl (Daley Pearson). 30 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2i0abEW NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
