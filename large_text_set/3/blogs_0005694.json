As far as fundamentals go, you should pay close attention to how each team is using Reinhardt. There’s seldom a good reason to not be Bastion’s personal shield if you’re into that pesky thing called ‘teamwork’, but don’t be afraid of playing mind games with your opponents if you see an opening, like in the following clip: \nWith Mercy pocket-healing a resilient Bastion on the high ground and the payload stuck, Nicolas and DCOP decide to make something happen, jumping down and forcing a couple of ultimates from Liquid. From a tactical perspective, a 50/50 move at that part of King’s Row seems too risky. Bastion is the key to making it feel less shocking for the defense. He’s able to provide a consistent stream of damage while the tanks eat AZK’s ultimate. It isn’t a huge win, but as the teams felt their way through the new pacing, it was as good as they could have hoped for. Countering Bastion \nAs it stands, there isn’t a hard counter for Bastion with his new buffs. That doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to counter him at all, however. Playing to the strengths of the current meta, flanking and burst DPS should at least force the opposing Bastion to uproot and focus on something other than your tanks and support. Killing him outright would be great, but we’ve all seen the videos or experienced how well that goes most of the time. Look at how Liquid punishes Complexity’s defense on point A of Anubis: \nTork respects the triple DPS threat and chooses to dance around a little bit, which provides Liquid with some respite from enemy fire. If he tried to wait it out, chances are a rocket or two combined with shurikens and Tracer harassment would have put him down on the spot. It’s in this way that Bastion really factors into the meta. With dive comps on the rise, you’re going to start seeing more and more ladder plays that involve swarming Bastion instead of picking him off at range like you could before. Here’s an example of how to build off of a Bastion kill: \nDoes this look familiar to you? Winston and Tracer have to double up with their ultimates to kill Bastion, which opens up the rest of Complexity and destroys their hold. Bastion is the loose thread you’re going to have to pull on in order to see success right now. The matter of Mercy \nMercy’s new invulnerability during Resurrect has been a long time coming, and it arrives just in time for the longer defense spawn times. No longer do you have to grit your teeth and hold your L when you rush in for a clutch rez. This more than likely won’t have a massive impact on the pro scene, but it’s a nice perk for Mercy mains. If you watched the previous clips, you saw that Complexity went for an Ana/Mercy combo against Liquid. So much for “don’t play Ana with Mercy,” right? Check out this excellent play: \nHere’s where having good game sense comes in handy. After ultimate goes off, Complexity knows Liquid doesn’t have much else to work with and reverse their fortunes with confidence. But what does it mean? \nMercy has always been popular on the ladder, let’s admit that. So for most of us, her new buff provides added utility to a popular character. We might see her used a little more at the pro level, but those guys need some more time with her in the lab. The changes to Bastion tell a different story. He’s no 76, but Blizzard has made him a decent hitscan option on both offense and defense. It’s doubtful that people will win games in the current meta just because of Bastion, but your average ladder dive comp will struggle chipping through Ironclad just as much as Bastion will struggle staying focused and alive if the attacking team is doing their job. Situations like this reward high levels of skill and execution, making the meta even more interesting than it already was.
