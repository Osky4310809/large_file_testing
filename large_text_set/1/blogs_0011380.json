We build whole festivals around it. \nAnd ever since the first Reagan inaugural in 1981, chowder from Legal Seafoods has been a staple of inauguration festivities. \nBut perhaps not this time. According to Roger Berkowitz, CEO of Legal Seafoods, there’s been radio silence out of the Trump transition team on the quadrennial chowder shipment. And a Trump transition spokesman told the Boston Globe that if in fact they’ve decided to dump the chowder, it wasn’t the president’s decision. \n“Trump’s promised a different way of doing things in D.C., so maybe chowder just isn’t on the menu so far,” says State Rep. Geoff Diehl (R-Whitman) the co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign. \nIt’s the kind of situation that breeds conspiracy theories. \nAfter all, the president-elect is a lifelong New Yorker. Is it possible he plans to replace genuine New England clam chowder with — ugh – Manhattan style? \nWe confronted Diehl on this. \n“Look, this is just another reason why its good that I’m advising him,” he said. “I will make sure that Massachusetts gets its due, and that Manhattan clam chowder should be off the menu.” \nAnd if that awful red gloop does show up on the inaugural menu? \n“They’ll be angry down there, red sauce stains the shirt,” insists Diehl. New England clam chowder is the way to go. \nHis advice to the president-elect?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:18:00.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
