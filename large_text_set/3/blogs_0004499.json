But for its next gallery show it’s going back to one of the founding pillars of nerd-dom by celebrating the 40th anniversary of Star Wars . And to do this, it’s brought back Mondo favorite Mike Mitchell to create a new batch of his signature full-color portraits of Star Wars characters in profile. Mitchell’s already done portraits of many of the principal players in the Star Wars universe, from Admiral Ackbar to Grand Moff Tarkin. But in this new poster revealed exclusively at The A.V. Club , he paints a dignified portrait of one of the grunts of the Star Wars universe: an Imperial TIE fighter pilot. Image: Mondo \nThe gallery show, “Mondo x Acme Archives Present: SWxMM,” collects Mitchell’s new portraits as well as his previously released Star Wars character prints, a limited number of which will be available for purchase (including his very first portrait in the series, “Red 5”). The show will launch during SXSW with an opening reception this coming Friday, March 10, from 7-10 p.m., and remain open during regular hours at the Mondo Gallery in Austin through Monday, March 13. And for those of us who can’t make it to Austin this weekend, the Mondo team will be conducting their very first Reddit AMA this afternoon at 2 p.m. CT. \nYou can see the specs for Mike Mitchell’s “Tie Fighter Pilot” character portrait below. \n12”x16” Giclee Print Signed & Hand numbered \nAvailable from Thursday (3/9) at 12PM CST through Sunday (3/12) at 12PM CST \nPrinted by Static Medium \nExpected to ship in 8-10 weeks \n$60​", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:25:33.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
