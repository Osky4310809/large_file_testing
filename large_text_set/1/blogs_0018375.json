Hegel who explored the oppositions of subjects instead of people, as the Greek school of thought taught. \nOn Instagram, the Mobb Deep rapper further shared the concept of the album, calling it “name brand intelligent gangsta shit” in a post with a clip for “Tyranny” and a joke about Donald Trump’s presidential campaign slogan. A video posted by Prodigy MobbDeep (@prodigymobbdeep) on Jan 20, 2017 at 12:37pm PST \nHegelian Dialectic: The Book Of Revelation is made up of 14 songs, including the single “ Mystic ,” which dropped back in July. \nLast year, Prodigy was busy touring with his Commissary Kitchen: My Infamous Prison Cookbook .
