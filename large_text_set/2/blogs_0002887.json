Greg Clarke has said he will step down from his position if the government does not support his proposed reforms of the organisation \nClarke said: \"I watched the debate and respect the opinions of the MPs. \n\"As previously stated we remain committed to reforming governance at The FA to the agreed timescale of the Minister.\" \nBut Damian Collins, Conservative MP and chairman of the Culture Media and Sport Select Committee, said the FA has spent the past 50 years talking about reform and called for decisive action. \nSpeaking in a backbench business debate in the Commons on FA governance, he said: \"We believe now that legislation is the only way in which this can be delivered. \n\"That was the recommendation of the last three chairmen of the FA to the select committee - to say that the FA cannot reform itself, the turkeys won't vote for Christmas, there has to be external pressure and external action through legislation to achieve it. \n\"What I'm asking in this debate today is that if the Government is unsuccessful in getting reform from the FA, that a Bill is prepared to be introduced into the next session of Parliament after the Queen's speech, to deliver the reform the FA so badly needs.\" Damian Collins is the chairman of the Culture Media and Sport Select Committee \nThe select committee has published two reports in recent years calling for an overhaul of the FA's board and council. \nThe FA has faced repeated criticism that its board is failing to reflect and represent the diversity of the game. \nLabour MP Keith Vaz, whose constituency of Leicester East is home to the Premier League champions Leicester City, hit out at the FA's lack of diversity. \nHe said: \"It is important that Parliament sends out a message on diversity - a quarter of all professional footballers are black, however only 17 of the 92 top clubs have an ethnic minority person in a senior coaching role. \n\"It's important that we send out that message that diversity should be an important part of any reform.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:47:11.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
