HARIBO’s investment in the 50,000 sq ft. project is expected to be $242 million, which makes it one of the largest by a foreign company to set up operations in Wisconsin. The factory is likely completed by 2020, according to a statement by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s Office. \n“As we are embarking on building one of the largest facilities in the confectionery industry, this location provides ideal conditions to further grow HARIBO’s successful business in the USA,” said Wes Saber, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HARIBO of America Inc. \nThe plan will also give a sugar rush to the economy of the area, adding nearly 400 jobs. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data as of January 2017, the Lake County-Kenosha County, IL-WI metro area has 428 employed persons and an unemployment rate of 6.5%. \nThe family-owned company was founded in 1920 in Bonn, and continued operations throughout the Second World War. Today HARIBO produces gummy creatures and liquorice candy across 16 locations across the globe, averaging a 100 million gummy bears a day. \nSo far, HARIBO only had a sales presence in the U.S., but with a manufacturing plant in place, it may be the beginning of gummy bear wars. Top candy makers have their own version of gummy and chewy candies like Sour Patch Kids by Mondelez ( MDLZ ). Some big retailers also produce gummy candy through their in-house brands, for example, Target’s ( TGT ) Market Pantry and Walmart’s ( WMT ) Great Value.
