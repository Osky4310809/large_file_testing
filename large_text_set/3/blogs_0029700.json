Yes, really. \nBut wait - the show already has a Winston, right? \nYes - and now it has two. The cast of New Girl (Photo: FOX Image Collection) \nThe character revealed his first name to his best friend, the Winston we already know played by Lamorne Morris. \nSchmidt tells Winston that from now on he wants to go by his full name, Winston Schmidt. \nNeedless to say, the original Winston is not happy about this decision. Schmidt's name comes as a shock (Photo: FOX Image Collection) \nFor what it's worth, if his first name isn't enough for you, Fox issued a press release tonight that specified Schmidt's cumbersome full name is actually 'Winston Saint-Marie Schmidt. \nWhat do you think about Schmidt's first name, Winston? Will he always simply be \"Schmidt\" to you? Tell us in the comments below.
