Edison’s mother was said to have had “problems of her own.” \nThe whereabouts of her father are unknown. \nTom and Taylor’s relationship started out innocent. \nI believed that we were in a relationship. I was prepared to do whatever would make Tom happy, for his own sake and so that I didn’t lose my only friend. \nTom would cook for Taylor and engage in meaningful conversation with her. With the absence of her family and her inability to make friends due to her condition, Taylor found comfort in Tom. \nThat was until he raped her on her mother’s bed. \nI didn’t know what he was doing when he turned me over and lay on top of me. I had read enough about sex by that time to have a vague idea of what was involved, and I was pretty sure he hadn’t put his penis where it was supposed to go. \nTom then pimped her out to be raped by other men from around her town. Some of them didn’t have much money to pay her afterward due to the fact they were from refugee camps. \nInstead, they’d hand over some marijuana or a bottle of vodka. \nI disassociated a lot from that whole time period. I don’t have many memories of it. I was always drinking quite heavily. It was a role I had to fit into. I would see it as ‘it’s time to go to work.’ \nNow, Taylor Edison has released a book titled “I Know What You Are.” She hopes to raise awareness about this horrifying abuse and put an end to similar scenarios by telling her own story. An incredibly brave Taylor shares her story growing up with Asperger syndrome in a brutal world https://t.co/7tI8jJ6rvf with @jswordsmith pic.twitter.com/vhogIKkcS3 \n— HarperNonFiction (@HarperNonFic) February 9, 2017 \nIn the book, she says, \nI had a very blinkered childhood. I didn’t really have many other children around me to compare it to. \nEventually, Taylor experienced more tragedy when she suffered two miscarriages as a young teenager because of the abusive lifestyle she was forced into. \nOne of the miscarriages was the result of a man pushing her down the stairs after she refused to have sex with him. \nAs she grew older, Taylor’s life began to change. After years of brutal sexual abuse, drug use and a lack of support from anyone with a beating heart, she eventually gave birth to her first child. \nThat’s when she knew she needed to snap out of whatever she was going through and get her life together for the sake of her child. \nThese days, Taylor Edison is far away from her mother’s house. Instead, she’s studying at a university and often seeks counseling to help with her past. \nShe’s also using her story to help save other children. Alongside author Jane Smith, Edison has written a new book she hopes will help others realize “what is done to you isn’t what you are.” A Way Out: Helping Domestic Violence Victims Reclaim Their Lives [INSIGHTS] To view this video please enable JavaScript, and considerupgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
