In view of this, JAMB will soon announce the commencement of sale of the 2017/2018 admission forms for UTME and Direct Entry (DE). \n“JAMB emphasises the fact that whoever is presently collecting any money in the name of JAMB form should be reported to the police or any other security agency as fraudster,” the statement added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:11:19.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
