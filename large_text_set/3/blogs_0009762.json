That won't be the case in 2017. After they squeaked past the Seton Hall Pirates in a semifinal showdown Friday, the top-seeded Wildcats blitzed the sixth-seeded Creighton Bluejays 74-60 at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night to solidify their status as the class of the conference. ESPN College Basketball on Twitter congratulated the Wildcats for officially securing a spot in the Big Dance: ESPN College BBall @ESPNCBB Champs! Villanova wins the Big East Conference tourney for the 2nd time in last 3 years, getting its @Audi Ticket punched to the Big Dance. https://t.co/VIkj2CBvXx 3/12/2017, 12:45:11 AM As was the case so often this season, Villanova's star-studded trio shouldered the scoring load. Josh Hart shined in the Big Apple spotlight and proved he's again ready for March Madness with 29 points (9-of-18 shooting) and six rebounds. Hart was particularly hot in the first half, when he poured in eight straight points to create some breathing room, as Villanova's Twitter account documented: Villanova MBB @NovaMBB 3/11/2017, 11:10:53 PM Jalen Brunson (17 points) was also in a groove. The sophomore combined with Hart to help give the Wildcats a 14-point halftime lead, and his Eurostep bucket in transition shortly before the break punctuated a momentum shift in the defending national champs' favor, as the Big East showed on Twitter: #BIGEASThoops @BIGEASTMBB Wildcats roaring at @TheGarden. They force the turnover and Brunson finishes on the break to lift @NovaMBB's lead. #BEtourney https://t.co/GrDdWRqLqh Brunson's play as Villanova took control particularly impressed CBS Sports' Matt Norlander: Matt Norlander @MattNorlander 3/11/2017, 11:23:38 PM Kris Jenkins was not to be forgotten. The 2016 NCAA tournament hero wasn't always at his sharpest Saturday, but he did pour in 14 points on 6-of-13 shooting, including 2-of-6 from three to give the Wildcats another perimeter dimension. The story differed for the Bluejays, who didn't have one scorer —much less three — break out and create problems for the defense. Marcus Foster, who drilled the game-winner against Xavier on Friday, was limited to 13 points on a shaky 5-of-13 shooting from the field, including 1-of-5 from three. He also committed four turnovers while dropping just two dimes. Perhaps more surprising was that Justin Patton couldn't get going against a small and relatively thin Villanova frontcourt. A day after he went for 21 points, Patton was limited to 10 points and five boards. However, the down night shouldn't dampen Creighton's spirits with Selection Sunday less than 24 hours away. The Bluejays have wins over Wisconsin, Seton Hall, Butler and Xavier that reinforce how tough they are against RIP Top 50 teams, and they should be considered one of the tournament's tougher at-large outs once things get going. Villanova, meanwhile, is in line to capture the tournament's No. 1 overall seed after the TCU Horned Frogs upset the Kansas Jayhawks in the Big 12 tournament. Should they nab that illustrious honor, the Wildcats will be in prime position to make a run as they embark on a quest to secure back-to-back national titles.
