Image copyright Family handout Image caption Julie Barnes-Frank was nominated for the Hero of the Year Stonewall Award in 2007 \nLinda Barnes-Frank, 52, who married Ms Barnes-Frank in 2005, said she was always \"committed heart and soul\" to helping lesbian and gay people combat prejudice \"not only in the police force but everywhere\". \nShe said they met while both working for GMP in 1987 - a time when the force was still \"a hostile environment\" where being gay \"was not the thing to be\". \nAfter \"hearing of more and more officers having issues at work\" with \"nobody to speak to\" the couple began campaigning for an organisation to provide help. \n\"It was quite a struggle to convince the force and prove there was a need for it,\" but with help from the Gay Police Association, they established LAGSA, she said. \n\"A lot has changed due to Julie's hard work and determination - today there's an embedded culture of respect for difference and greater equality,\" she added. 'Charming, yet determined' \nSmyth Harper, LGBT Foundation chair, said Ms Barnes-Frank was \"instrumental\" in transforming GMP from \"a service notorious for its prejudice against LGBT to one that is now perhaps one of the most open and accepting police services in world\". \nShe was one of the first officers to march in the Pride parade in London in 2003 , hailed as a crucial moment marking changes in police attitudes toward the gay community. \nMs Barnes-Frank was \"proud\" to be \"breaking down barriers\" between police and the gay community at the march, Linda Barnes-Frank said. \nFollowing her retirement in 2009, she was awarded the first Alan Turing Memorial Award for her work to tackle discrimination by the LGBT Foundation and Manchester City Council.

Her legacy is a GMP that is more inclusive and equitable of LGBT people.\" \nA statement from GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said she \"supported countless colleagues through LGBT issues\" and was \"widely respected and well liked\". \n\"[Julie] worked tirelessly to change policy, to prevent bullying and gain acceptance for LGBT staff but always in a fair, balanced and practical way,\" he said.
