Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nOnce upon a time, a weekly shop consisted of a visit to the butcher for your meat, the grocer's for your fruit and veg and the fishmonger's for your fish. \nFor everything else there were other dedicated shops and trades. Ironmongers, haberdasheries, bakers... \nThe nature of shopping has changed dramatically over the last few decades, and supermarkets have both cottoned on to and capitalised on these changes. \nBecause we're busy and like convenience, supermarkets have become mega one-stop-shops where you can buy pretty much anything . \nBut there are few things we should avoid during our after-work trolley dash, according to consumer saving expert, Andrea Woroch. Watch out for certain items (Photo: Getty) \nSpeaking to Mental Floss , Andrea has revealed which items these are - and WHY we should be sourcing them elsewhere. 1. Spices \nThe mark-up on these is shocking, with Andrea revealing it is often round the 100 per cent mark. The mark up on these is eye-watering \nTo this end, she recommends buying your herbs and spices from a health-food store, ethnic grocery shop or even a local convenience store. 2. Batteries \nDescribing these as a \"classic impulse buy\", Andrea explains that batteries are often placed near the till, tempting you into throwing them in with the rest of your shopping. Batteries are best bought in bulk - and no from the till \nBut there is very little chance you'll be making any savings this way - which you COULD do (by up to 50 per cent) by buying them in bulk elsewhere. \nA pack of four AA Duracell batteries from Sainsbury's costs £4 or £1 per battery, but you can buy a pack of 12 from Amazon for £6.34 or just 52 per battery. 3. Baby and beauty products \nBecause of the regularity with which we use products, the cost of them really mounts up. \nYet you can make savings switching to high street chemists or Poundland, as they are much more likely to have special offers on than supermarkets.

Pre-prepared fruit and veg \nSure, it's quick and easy, but buying bagged or packaged fruit and veg could cost you three times as much. \nFor example, a 400g tub of Sainsbury's Pineapple Pieces costs £1.50, making it 50p more expensive than a whole pineapple, which you can pick up from the store for just £1.00. Fruit and veg was one of the worst culprits \nYou can dramatically cut the cost by shopping more locally - and support independent businesses. 5. Packaged meat \nThe same pretty much applies to meat as it does to fruit and veg. \nAndrea explains, \"the convenience of buying pre-formed hamburger patties or assembled steak kebabs is going to cost you anywhere from 60 to 300 percent more than buying the meat in its whole form.\" Read More The best times to bag 'yellow sticker' bargains at the biggest supermarkets revealed As was meat \nShe recommends taking the \"middle ground\" and buying a large hunk of meat and asking your butcher to either cube it or mince it.
