The show is carried on Hearst stations as well as CBS, Meredith, Nexstar, E.W. Scripps, Tegna and Tribune, and is adding Fox-owned stations in Los Angeles and Charlotte to reach about 75% of the country, according to Hearst. It is distributed nationally by Sony.

She added that because the show has a magazine format, they have the advantage of context that may be missed by other talk shows. \nEmerson Coleman, vice president of programming at Hearst Television, said that the genesis of the show was to focus on more diverse voices. He cited as an example an interview with youth leader Farajii Muhammad after a mistrial in the Freddie Gray case. \nO’Brien will debut on the show on Sept. 10-11. She said that they are planning a commemoration of the 15th anniversary of 9/11. \nShe also says that their base in D.C. will help them be competitive with other Sunday morning shows in landing boldfaced names. \n“Most of the people I do interviews with, whether they are friendly or contentious, they always respect that the conversation will be smart and they will be held to a really high standard,” she said.
