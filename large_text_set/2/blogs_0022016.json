If that’s still not enough for you, this obscure and kind of awesome Kanye West sculpture should do the trick. \nA street artist who calls himself Plastic Jesus has composed a life-size gold sculpture of the 39-year-old rapper recreating the crucifixion of Jesus. \nOn February 22, the Los Angeles-based artist erected the sculpture called “False Idol” at Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue in West Hollywood. \nThe sculpture features nails in each of Kanye’s hands. Also included are a pair of Yeezys from West’s popular collaboration with Adidas. \nStreet artist Plastic Jesus spoke to the Hollywood Reporter about what inspired him to create the sculpture, saying , \nHe’s a genius at writing and producing but he’s not a God, and that’s where we put him. Until there’s an issue in his life or a hiccup in his career, then we crucify him. \nHe’s making a great point. After all, Kanye West was the first person to refer to himself as a so-called “God.” I’m surprised it took this long for the “False Idol” sculpture to come about!

The same people who put him into a God-like place are the same yapping at his heels for a piece of flesh when something happens. \nPlastic Jesus goes on to express he is a longtime loyal fan, supporter and “admirer” of Kanye. Aren’t we all?! Well, I guess some of us are. But those who constantly crucify him? Giphy \nThe photojournalist-turned-artist went on to say, \nThe piece is intended to be as critical of us as consumers and the media as it is of Kanye himself. We’ve created this idol from somebody who is clearly talented. \nWhen asked how much money he spent creating the piece, Plastic Jesus said he wasn’t sure. The process wasn’t particularly short. The street artist teamed up with a Las Vegas-based artist named Ginger. \nGinger is the same artist who composed those life-size sculptures of President Donald Trump . Back in August, Ginger’s Trump sculptures popped up around the country in cities like Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. \nPlastic Jesus says he approached Ginger and asked him to create Kanye’s head for his “False Idol” piece. As you clearly see, it all worked out! \nMove over, Trump. It’s Yeezy’s turn! Giphy \nSo, what’s the overall message, according to Mr. Jesus? \nI would say the message is this: By all means, treat and respect these people as artists, but don’t make them into gods — because we crucify our gods. \nNow, cue up “Jesus Walks,” and let’s take a walk to Hollywood and La Brea, shall we?!
