The Fate of the Furious promises to turn the franchise on its head as Vin Diesel ’s Dom finds himself pitted against his high-speed family. With Jason Statham ’s Deckard Shaw taking his place on the squad, the racing crew will work to bring Dom back to their side while a mysterious female antagonist tries to keep him in place. And, in the mix, Helen Mirren will also find herself in the film in an unseen role. \nOf course, the British actress has been mum about her part in the film, and the studio has been happy to oblige her want of secrecy. However, it looks like fans just found out what the star’s role really is. Thanks to Luke Evans , fans know now that Mirren is playing the mother of Owen and Deckard Shaw. \nWhen Evans was asked whether his character from the franchise might awaken from a coma, the actor had this to say: \n“People come around from comas, so who knows? He’s in a military hospital because he’s the most wanted man in the world, but he’s got a very powerful brother, and he’s now got a mum as well, who’s played by Helen Mirren.” \nOf course, fans will know how Evans’ character wound up in the franchise. Owen wound up in a coma after facing off with Dom’s crew, and the incident sent Deckard on a bloody path towards revenge. Now, it seems like the Shaw’s mother is getting in on the action. Many fans had assumed the actress would be related to the Shaw family in someway given her shared accent with Statham but having confirmation from Evans is something for fans to latch onto now. \nIf you want to check out the synopsis for The Fate of the Furious , you can read it below!

But when a mysterious woman (Oscar® winner Charlize Theron) seduces Dom into the world of crime he can’t seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before. \n\"From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, our elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world’s stage…and to bring home the man who made them a family.” \nFor The Fate of the Furious, Vin Diesel is joined by a returning all-star cast that includes Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Elsa Pataky and Kurt Russell.
