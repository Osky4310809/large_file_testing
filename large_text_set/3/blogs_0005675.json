Locals claim the man-made sandstone caves have, in recent times, been used for ‘magic rituals’. Trends Viral \nLocated a meter (3.3ft) underground and hewn into the rock inside a disused quarry, the caves contain several alcoves, decorative stone features and a font. \nTheir structure has been detailed for the first time by Historic England , a public body that looks after England’s historic environment, which has categorized the site as a grotto. \nKnown as the Caynton Caves and located in woodland near Shifnal in Shropshire, they were, according to local legend, used as a secret place of worship by the Knights Templar – a Catholic military order founded in the 12th century. \nHistoric England notes that the caves probably date from the late 18th or early 19th centuries but are “undatable” .

Pagans and druids have been rumored to visit the caves to carry out rituals, with “black magic” even said to have been carried out there, according to Historic England.

It has also garnered fame through films and books including ‘The Da Vinci Code.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T14:01:51.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
