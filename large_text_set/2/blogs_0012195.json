The pilot correctly read back the clearance. The pilot then landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway. The FAA is investigating this incident,” the FAA said in a statement to Variety .\nThis is not the first time Harrison has been involved in an airplane incident – he was involved in an accident almost two years ago.\nPictured inside: Harrison with the plane on Monday (February 13) doing a check before taking off in Santa Monica, Calif.
