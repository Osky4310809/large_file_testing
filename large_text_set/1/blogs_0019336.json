Elijah Mohammed, expressed gratitude to the House and said the resolution came at a time when the Council had stepped up its enforcement activities. \nHe acknowledged that it served to strengthen the Council influshingout the quacks and will help to win theneeded peace in the pharmacy practice environment.
