He had previously been listed as questionable with tightness in his left lateral quad. \nThough his scoring (25 points per game), shooting percentage (46.9) and three-point shooting percentage (41) have dipped playing alongside Kevin Durant this season, Curry remains among the league’s elite. He ranks 11th in the NBA in scoring, 18th in assists (6.1), 2nd in free throw percentage (91.9) and first in three-pointers made (188). \nWith Curry sidelined, Shaun Livingston is expected to make his first start this season. Livingston is averaging 5.3 points, two rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. \nConnor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: .
