For NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum and the rest of the league office, that couldn't ring more true. \nAs was announced in November , the NBA will host its inaugural end-of-season awards show on June 26 in New York City. The event, which will unveil the league's Most Valuable Player, among other awards, veers away from the NBA's previous practice of announcing winners separately throughout the postseason. \nThis year's MVP race, as luck would have it, happens to be one of the tightest in league history. \n\"We couldn't have asked for a better MVP race leading into our first NBA awards show,\" Tatum told USA TODAY Sports over the phone on Monday. \" ... As a fan, it's been incredible to see. Such great performances by the players in our league. I also think it's not just the MVP vote, but there's a lot of discussion about the coaching job that many of our coaches have done and the performances defensively of many of our players in the league. It's going to be an incredible celebration of the amount of depth of talent that we have in our league.\" \nNo kidding. \n► There's the MVP race : James Harden and Russell Westbrook sit at the forefront, with Harden's case fueled by record-shattering performances and team success and Westbrook's fueled by his quest for the single-season triple-double crown. Close behind are LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard, who are both enjoying MVP-worthy seasons of their own. \n► The Defensive Player of the Year race: Draymond Green could be crowned after two years of finishing second. So could shot-blocking extraordinaire Rudy Gobert, who sends back an NBA-best 2.6 attempts per game. Or Leonard, who would become the second player in NBA history to win the award three years in a row. \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T12:25:20.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
