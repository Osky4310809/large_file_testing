Now you got everybody wanting to fucking fight each other. This shit getting corny as fuck now … Where the fuck was all y’all rappers at last year? Y’all muthafuckas was beefing not one muthafuckas said ‘Let’s have a boxing match.’ Two niggas say they having a boxing match … now you wanna fight. Come up with your own shit, man. Stop riding the coattails off another nigga, man. Shit weak. Let them two do what they do, man. A video posted by DJ Akademiks (@akadmiks) on Jan 13, 2017 at 6:04pm PST \nSo far there have been at least six boxing challenges made (or at least joked about) including: 22 Savage vs. 21 Savage \nAs of press time, none of these fights have come remotely close to being a reality. A fact that Bow Wow seems to think is for the best, at least for fans of the fundamentals of the sweet science. \n“These niggas can’t even fucking fight … Have you seen videos of these niggas? How they look punching? … Why do you think most of your favorite rappers always talk about gunplay or shooting a nigga? It’s easy. Because none of these niggas can’t fucking fight in real life,” he says, adding that it’s the members of the rappers’ entourages who are the real fighters. \n“I’m just saying. Y’all gotta cut this shit out,” he concludes. \nWill this latest rant offend someone enough that they’ll call Bow Wow out for a boxing match? Judging by how 2017 is going so far, yes, yes, it will.
