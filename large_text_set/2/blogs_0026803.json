The folks behind Beat Brasserie and The Beehive have plans to open a new restaurant within the Lafayette City Center building on Washington Street, and while they have not yet named the new restaurant, it will reportedly be a \"food, beverage, and social concept,\" according to the Boston Business Journal . The Beehive and Beat Brasserie both very heavily feature live music as a key component of their concepts. Paperwork with the state indicates that co-owner Jack Bardy filed an LLC called Wheelings Downtown last month, but that seems to follow the naming convention of his other LLCs — Wheelings Bar and Wheelings Brattle for The Beehive and Beat Brasserie respectively — so that’s not necessarily indicative of the new venue’s name. The new restaurant replaces a previous plan to have a Florida-based nightclub called Latitude 360 open within the building, as Boston Restaurant Talk noted . The as-yet unnamed restaurant will take up a massive 63,000 square feet of space at the corner of the building, which sits at Washington Street and Avenue de Lafayette. The owners will present plans for the restaurant at a neighborhood meeting in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:52:49.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
