Now, we mourn another loss with the passing of Ron Cito, owner of the iconic Italian eatery and grand-nephew of the restaurant’s founders. As Westword reports , Cito died on Feb. 11 at the age of 81. Last summer he talked to The Denver Post about the decision to close the restaurant, saying, “I was hoping I could stay here until its 100 th birthday, but due to health…I just can’t handle it anymore.” Services for Cito will be held Wednesday, Feb. 22 at 2 p.m. at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church (3549 Navajo St., Denver).
