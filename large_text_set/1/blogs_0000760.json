Sure, you could go paleo or vegan , but for people don't want to spend 99 percent of their lives explaining their dietary restrictions and why it's important others follow suit, the difference between healthy and garbage food can be difficult to determine. Here are the breakfast foods you eat all the time that are low key not good for you. (As for what you should be eating, I don't know. I'm basically a hummingbird and I just drink smoothies.) 1. Orange Juice \nvia GIPHY \nAccording to Modernhealthmonk.com (we have no idea about the legitimacy of the site it's just the first to pop up on Google), orange juice is slowly killing you. While that may sound a bit dramatic, orange juice is chock full of sugar which may add unwanted weight over time. It can also cause heartburn and some digestive issues. Need that Vitamin C? Get it from a multivitamin and be done with it. 2. Bagels \nvia GIPHY \nBagels are everywhere, so they can't be that bad for you, right? Perhaps they're not \"slowly killing you\" like those stealthy, murderous oranges, but bagels are made from refined wheat flour which means all the fiber and good stuff that make whole grains food for you are GONE. WITH THE WIND. Also one bagel is equivalent to about six slices of bread. So do yourself a favor and pass the bagel in favor of five slices of bread and consider yourself winning at the healthy life. (No, don't do that.) 3. Dried Fruit \nvia GIPHY \nBefore you tell Granny to GTFO if she tries to give you another box of raisins, hear me out. Not all dried fruits are bad. You just have to watch out for the ones with added sugar. Fruits have enough sugar on their own, but when you throw in more sugar, you're basically eating candy. So, like, just go eat candy. (Don't do that. That was a joke.) 4. Bran Muffin \nvia GIPHY \nIn theory, these B.M.-instigators are good for you. Ingredients aren't all that bad, they have some health benefits. But the issues comes with their size. One Trader Joe’s bran muffin is 140 calories, but the serving size is only half a muffin. A whole muffin would be 280 calories and 26 grams of sugar. By the way, WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND ONLY EATS HALF A MUFFIN? 5. Granola \nvia GIPHY \nGranola is one tricky son of a breakfast. It looks healthy and tastes healthy, but it isn't. The reason? Sugar yet again. Most nutrition experts agree you want a breakfast high in protein and fiber to keep you feeling fuller longer. 6. Cereal \nvia GIPHY \nHashtag sad, hashtag why. But hashtag true, cereal ain't that great for you. ¾ cup of Kashi Crunch is 190 calories and 13 grams of sugar. In comparison, one cup of Lucky Charms has 14 grams of sugar. So the cereal you're reaching for thinking you're being all healthy could actually be worse than the treat of your youth. To avoid the spike in blood sugar and subsequent energy dip once the sugar rush is gone, try plain old oatmeal or just not eating ever again. I heard that's healthy. \nDistraught? Heartbroken? So are we. We could live off cereal and bagels forever but now what’re we supposed to do?! HM?!
