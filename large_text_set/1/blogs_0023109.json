We want to play in the Inter style in Turin and take the initiative. \n\"We're doing good things, but I am sure we can do even better. I have players of a high level, but we've not yet reached our peak and that should give us real confidence going forward. \n\"We've done nothing yet, we are not in the position we want to be or playing the football we want.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T03:59:08.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
