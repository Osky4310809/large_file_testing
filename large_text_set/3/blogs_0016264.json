By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 20, 2017 3:49 PM Ram Madhav congratulates N Biren Singh and his ministers for winning the trust of vote. (Source: ANI) \nBharatiya Janata Party’s National General Secretary Ram Madhav has congratulated Manipur’s new Chief Minister N Biren Singh for winning the trust of vote in today’s floor test. Ram Madhav who has also authored several books also congratulated other MLAs who took oathwith Biren Singh on 16th March. “Congratulations to CM Biren Singh and his team of ministers and MLAs for winning the trust vote today,” he added. Manipur was in a five-month-long blockage when Biren Singh took charge but lifted it on Sunday as promised by the new CM. \nYou may also want to watch: \nRam Madhav believes that it is a huge achievement for the new government and will help it connect with the people. “First thing that our government has achieved is good dialogue with people who were engaged in the blockade and convincing them to lift it,” he said. This blockade was imposed by the United Naga Council on November 1 as a way to protest against the previous Chief Minister of state Okram Ibobi Singh. The Congress leader had been the CM of Manipur since 2002 but had to resign after his party failed to prove majority. \nThis blockade was affecting the lives of the common man in various ways. Since it was also implied on two national highways NH-2 and NH-37, the prices of essential commodities rose in the state which eventually affected normal life. This was a major issue going into the recent assembly polls and BJP had promised to act about it if they come into power. Appreciating the “first step of the newly formed government” led by the BJP, Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla said the lifting of the blockade “will usher in an era of peace and prosperity” in the northeastern state. \nYou may also want to watch: \nChief Minister Biren Singh said it is only one of few steps taken by the new government. “Our effort is to make it (lifting of blockade) successful. It is just the beginning. The word was given by honourable Prime Minister Modiji to the people of Manipur during the election campaign. We are trying to fulfil his words,” he told news channel NDTV.
