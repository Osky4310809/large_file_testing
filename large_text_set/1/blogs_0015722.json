Bush and Obama; Tim Geithner, the New York Fed president beginning in 2003 and then Treasury secretary in the early years of the Obama administration; and Hank Paulson, Bush’s final Treasury secretary. \nNone of them did a very good job of anticipating the financial crisis. But when the global banking system was close to collapse, they acted heroically. They arranged mergers for faltering banks, lent money to corporations, and extended deposit insurance to stop bank runs. And yes, they helped sell Congress on a controversial bank “bailout” bill that generated much blowback and mindless demonization. \nIf that bill constituted a bailout, there needs to be a new definition of bailout. It not only helped save the American banking system, it also produced a $15.3 billio n profit for taxpayers. Including other “bailouts,” undertaken separate from that legislation (for such institutions as insurance giant AIG and the mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) the total profit to taxpayers was $85.6 billion. \nEven more profits flowed when Bernanke initiated a much derided program of buying mortgages and U.S. government debt. From 2010 to 2015, the Fed remitted to the Treasury $ 517.3 billion in profits. That’s at least $300 billion more than the Fed would remit under normal circumstances. \nThe biggest windfall, however, was that the world avoided another Great Depression. \nDespite the slow and uneven recovery from the financial meltdown, economic historians will undoubtedly recognize Bernanke, Geithner and Paulson for their important leadership roles at moments of crisis.
