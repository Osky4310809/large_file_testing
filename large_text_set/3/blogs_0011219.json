All of the images of the first meeting of the council pictured only men on stage, with nary a woman to be found. Satire? Comedy? No. This is actually happening: The very first meeting of the first \"Girls Council\" in Saudi Arabia... with ZERO girls. pic.twitter.com/MPmHsr9FCO â€” Sarah Abdallah (@sahouraxo) March 13, 2017 \nEven chair of the council, Princess Abir bint Salman, was not in the photo. (Her husband was, however.) Apparently, the girls were in a separate room and were \"present\" via a video stream. The Qassim Girls Council is the \"first of its kind\" for Saudi Arabia. \nIn Saudi Arabia, women are not permitted to drive. They are subject to a national dress code and cannot wear clothes or makeup that \"show off their beauty.\" \nAnd apparently, they can't even be featured in a council about their own gender. \nPathetic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T07:15:17.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
