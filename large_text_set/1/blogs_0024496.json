Could   \nPhilippe Coutinho sent a message of hope to Liverpool fans by insisting he signed a long-term contract because he’s convinced he’ll win honours at Anfield. \nThe Reds have endured one of the worst weeks in their history after seeing their hopes of silverware dashed on three fronts with three baffling home defeats. \nYet the brilliant Brazilian explained that his vision is not about one week, but about a long term belief that manager Jurgen Klopp will deliver trophies. \n“Yes, it was hugely disappointing - we have all left the dressing room feeling so disappointed because we lost again, it is very hard,” he admitted. \n“I signed a new contract and there was a message. I am happy to sign, and I would like to say it is not about one week, no matter how bad that is, it is about the future with this squad.

Everyone believes in that, and everyone wants to bounce back at this moment. \n“Yes it has been a bad week, but we are looking beyond that. Of course we believe we can win titles under this manager – we are confident that will happen. \n“Like I said before I have signed because the manager is a winner, and everyone believes in him. I believe in what he does, and everyone inside the dressing room believes he will take this team to titles – that is why I signed a new contract, and that is what we want to do.” Coutinho and Moreno slump off the field after defeat to Wolves (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Second tier Wolves became the latest side to win at Anfield (Photo: Getty Images) Klopp's side are now in action against Chelsea in midweek (Photo: X01095) Read More Philippe Coutinho wants to become a Liverpool legend after landing new deal \nCoutinho sent a message to his demoralised team-mates too, urging them to pick themselves up and fight their way back onto the fringes of the title race at least, by beating runaway Premier League leaders Chelsea on Tuesday. \n“We have to lift ourselves for Chelsea, that is very important. We have another opportunity straight away to bounce back, and it is a good opportunity, a big game against Chelsea. That is it,” he added. \n“We have a few days to prepare everything, and to go again and that is what we must do now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T00:46:00.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
