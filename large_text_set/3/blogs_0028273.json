Man reaches into mailbox to find a red bellied black snake snuggled in his newspaper Sarah Swain, Manly Daily March 24, 2017 2:42pm \nREACHING into his mailbox for his Manly Daily , Peter Almhofer was greeted by a venomous snake instead. \nThe 42-year-old discovered the red-bellied black snake snuggled inside the paper at his home in Narrabeen. \nAccording to a wildlife expert, however, it was just one of many critters found in an unusual spot seeking shelter from the persistent rain. media_camera Red bellied black snake which was found in the mailbox in Narrabeen \nMr Almhofer said the snake was lurking in the newspaper holder and later slithered into the actual box. \n“The paper was half hanging out of the tube next to the mailbox,” he said. “It was just inside the paper. I piled it out a little bit and I noticed a tail hanging out. \n“I thought it was a lizard that lives in the garden and then I thought, ‘it looks like a snake’. \n“I got a torch and it turned around and stuck its head out.’ \nMr Almhofer phoned Northern Beaches Council, which arranged for Sydney Wildlife expert Lynleigh Greig to help. \nMs Greig, from Elanora Heights, identified the snake and said while it was venomous, it would have been unlikely to attack. media_camera Lynleigh Greig from Sydney Wildlife came to the rescue \n“Red-bellies are not an aggressive species and are very reluctant to bite,” she said. \n“We do, however, recommend that you stay out of the strike zone of any snake and leave it to Sydney Wildlife, WIRES or another professional snake-catching organisa­tion to relocate them to a place that is safer for them and for humans.” \nShe said many animals had been seeking shelter in unusual places. A ringtail possum was even found in a book case. media_camera Snake catcher Rob Gleeson with a red-bellied black snake, the same type which was huddled in the mailbox \n“Lots of golden crown snakes have been sneaking indoors for some respite from the rain,” Ms Greig said. “Pythons have also been hiding in pot plants undercover and at people’s front doors. \n“We’ve also had reports of green tree snakes popping indoors.” \nDetails: Sydney Wildlife on 9413 4300 or WIRES on 1300 094 737.
