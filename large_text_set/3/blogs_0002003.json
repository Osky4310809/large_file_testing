We ARE some of Disney's biggest fans after all! \nRelated: It's CG VS OG In Our Beauty And The Beast Review Roundup! \nBut not everyone is gay for the news. \nThe Henagar Drive-In Theater in Henagar, Alabama has officially decided to DROP the movie from its upcoming schedule based on the news. In a Facebook post, the owner of the \"family-friendly\" theater explained : \n\"It is with great sorrow that I have to tell our customers that we will not be showing Beauty and the Beast at the Henagar Drive-In when it comes out. When companies continually force their views on us we need to take a stand. We all make choices and I am making mine. If we can not take our 11 year old grand daughter and 8 year old grandson to see a movie we have no business watching it. If I can't sit through a movie with God or Jesus sitting by me then we have no business showing it.\" \nYou guys remember in the Bible all those passages about which films were OK to watch, right? \n​In case you were curious, this week's double feature is The Eagle Huntress and A Dog's Purpose . So Jesus is obviously able to compartmentalize all the controversy about animal mistreatment . \nRelated: A Dog's Purpose Crashes Hard At The Box Office \nThe statement continues: \n\"I know there will be some that do not agree with this decision. That's fine. We are first and foremost Christians. We will not compromise on what the Bible teaches. We will continue to show family oriented films so you can feel free to come watch wholesome movies without worrying about sex, nudity, homosexuality and foul language.\" \nRight. \"Wholesome.\" Because telling your children to condemn those who are born different is a family value you just can't let go of. \nRelated: The Disney Channel Just Aired Its First Ever Same-Sex Cartoon Kiss! \nLet's just say this for all those out there that don't get it. They aren't upset about homosexual content meaning depictions of gay sex. They're upset about the EXISTENCE OF GAY CHARACTERS. \nWell, you know what? Our existence is not up for your debate or your judgment. This hateful bullshit is about as antiquated as your drive-in theater. \nHave fun with your Buddhist dog movie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T01:10:04.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
