I’m not doing that no more! I don’t give a fuck! I’m — me.” And that’s what led me to coming out and shit. \nIt was in the middle of the goddamn afterparty at the Up&Down club [in New York].

And I’m here in the middle of the floor, no security, and they coming and I just step to the side and they see me and stop and the biggest motherfucker in the game goes, woo woo woo , “Next time I’ma fuck you up!” \nAnd all security and everybody stop like, “What the fuck. ” And the guys with me was like, “What you do?!” \nI don't have nothing to say. All I did was smile. And I guess they took that as a threat. I was confused, like, “It can’t be little old me. I’m just a goddamned old record from way back when. What the fuck am I doing causing stresses and pains?” \nAround all that security, the dude that’s doing it — we have a platinum-selling record together! The guy! The leader of the crew!
