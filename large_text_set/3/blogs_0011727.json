According to CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora , Rodgers' deal is worth $3.3 million with another $1 million available through incentives. Rodgers is expected to earn $600,000 via a signing bonus. The 2016 season was Rodgers' first with the Bucs, and it marked the best campaign of his six-year NFL career from a rushing perspective. Rodgers set career highs with 560 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns on 4.3 yards per carry in 10 games. He also contributed as a pass-catcher with 13 grabs for 98 yards. The 27-year-old veteran was a key contributor for the Bucs due largely to the fact that fellow running backs Doug Martin and Charles Sims dealt with injuries for much of the year. Rodgers did miss time with a foot sprain , but he was undoubtedly Tampa's most effective back when healthy. Near the conclusion of the 2016 season, Buccaneers head coach Dirk Koetter made it clear he wanted Rodgers back in the fold for 2017, according to Bonnie Mott of USA Today : \"Hopefully we get him back in the future. I'm going to hold him to that in the offseason. He's not flashy. He is very tough. He is very consistent. He's an extremely smart player. We had a big drop-off in explosive plays from our running backs this year. Jacquizz came in and filled a big void for us.\" He became an especially big priority after Martin was suspended four games for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing drugs policy. The 2016 season marked the most work Rodgers ever received as a rusher with 129 carries after previously serving primarily as a third-down back. He spent the first four seasons of his career with the Atlanta Falcons after being selected in the fifth round of the 2011 NFL draft out of Oregon State. He appeared in just five contests with the Chicago Bears in 2015, but he rebuilt his value in a big way during his time with Tampa. Last season was the first time Rodgers showed he was capable of being a bell-cow back, and he may get an opportunity to be precisely that for the Bucs in 2017. Rodgers is in line to start at least the first three games of the season with Martin out, and if he continues to make a positive impact, a full-time starting role is possible.
