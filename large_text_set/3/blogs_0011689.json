Not only did she have all five of the top five most-liked posts on the app , last year, she was also the most followed person.\nBut in a frank interview with Vogue , the singer explains that her social media success has negatively impacted her mental health — and she’s even gone so far as to delete Instagram from her phone.\nGomez tells Vogue , “as soon as I became the most followed person on Instagram, I sort of freaked out.”\nI want to thank Rob Haskell for writing my story. I was a little nervous at how honest I was but you depicted where I'm at perfectly. I'm so grateful @voguemagazine @mertalas @macpiggott ❤️ \nA post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Mar 16, 2017 at 8:55am PDT \n\n“It had become so consuming to me. It’s what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict, and it felt like I was seeing things I didn’t want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn’t want to care about.\n“I always end up feeling like shit when I look at Instagram.

She continues, “look, I love what I do, and I’m aware of how lucky I am, but—how can I say this without sounding weird? I just really can’t wait for people to forget about me.”\nRead the full article over on Vogue , where she also touches on her relationship with The Weeknd.\n@SelenaGomez is our April cover star!
