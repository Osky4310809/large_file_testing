USA TODAY Sports Denver Broncos head coach Vance Joseph speaks during a press conference at UCHealth Training Center. (Photo: Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWith the moves last week that made Vance Joseph and Anthony Lynn the first African-American head coaches of the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers, respectively, the NFL can take a bow for its efforts to create a more inclusive hiring landscape. \nThis is how it’s supposed to work. Two hard-working coaches who have earned respect as they paid their dues climbing the ladder are given chances – and the same can be said for Sean McDermott, the first-time coach of the Buffalo Bills, who happens to be white -- to survive on the hottest seats in the league. \nThe number of minority head coaches in the NFL is at eight again, matching the total from 2011 as most in the league’s history. \nThen again, 14 is a more magical number. With Joseph and Lynn added, there’s a new, record number of combined minority head coaches and general managers. And that total of 14 doesn’t even include Miami Dolphins GM Chris Grier, whose title lacks the power of final authority over personnel, or account for the possibility that a minority candidate might emerge in the general manager position with the San Francisco 49ers, who are poised to hire Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan as coach. \nIt’s no wonder that John Wooten, chairman of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, told USA TODAY Sports: “I’m very pleased with the whole process.” \nNobody in the NFL universe has worked harder on behalf of minority candidates, nor for as long as Wooten, whose group monitors and promotes diversity. When I met him during the early 1980s, he was one of the few African-American scouts in the NFL for the Dallas Cowboys, beating the drum for diversity. \nNow, after retiring as a longtime personnel executive, Wooten damned near goes 24/7 in trying to match candidates with decision-makers, or pushing Commissioner Roger Goodell or other league honchos about policies, or in grooming candidates, or courting college coaches. \nSome coaching prospects are pushed by powerful agents, or are connected by old-boy networks. Wooten tries to level the field for minorities in the same right. \nWhat encourages him most about the current hiring cycle? \n“I can truthfully say there was not one single sham interview,” Wooten said. \nThat’s huge, maybe even bigger than the eight-is-not-enough total of minority coaches. Throughout the history of the Rooney Rule (instituted in 2002, named for Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, former head of the NFL’s diversity committee) that mandates that at least one minority is interviewed for head coaching jobs, interviews suspected as shams were part of the fabric. \nIn 2003, former Detroit Lions president Matt Millen became the (still-only) person fined for violating the rule. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was once taken to the carpet for complying by talking to Dennis Green over the phone. And just last year, Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, considered a rising coaching star, expressed the sense that half of his interviews weren’t serious opportunities. \nThis year’s cycle, though, comes on the heels of a memo that Goodell sent to teams in late December that outlined “best practices” that included not stopping at just one minority candidate to interview. Goodell also suggested that teams employ the spirit of the Rooney Rule for coordinator openings, too. \nIt appears that the half-dozen teams that had head coaching vacancies followed the directives, leading to a continuation of the pattern in recent years of more candidates overall – including whites – having opportunities to interview. \nBefore making Sean McVay, 30, the NFL’s youngest head coach, the Los Angeles Rams considered 10 candidates. It wasn’t too long ago when it was typical for NFL teams to lock in on one candidate, or interview just two or three for a job. It’s also significant that Lynn, previously an assistant head coach for five years with the New York Jets, got a shot after calling plays for less than a full season after being promoted to coordinator by the Buffalo Bills in September. \n“Clubs are casting a wider net,” Cyrus Mehri, who serves as counsel for the Fritz Pollard Alliance, told USA TODAY Sports. “A lot of young guys, white and black, are getting chances. The key is that the clubs are stepping up not merely by the letter of the Rule, but in spirit.” \nBetter late than never. When the Rooney Rule was established, there were just two minority head coaches and never more than three in a league with roughly two-thirds of its players African-American. \n“Now coaches at least have a fighting chance to get a job,” Mehri said. \nStill, sometimes the results from one year can overshadow the biases that still exist. \nI mean, it was only weeks ago that Pittsburgh Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw blasted Mike Tomlin as no more than a cheerleader – a term you don’t hear applied to, say, fiery Sean Payton of the New Orleans Saints or Bruce Arians of the Arizona Cardinals. \nTomlin, the youngest coach to win a Super Bowl, is only heading into the AFC title game at New England with a chance to take a third team to a Super Bowl. \nWooten wants to see more African-Americans in the offensive coordinator and quarterback coach roles that have been traditional stepping-stones to head coaching jobs – which is why he’s actively courting some college coaches for further development. \nIn the meantime, he believes there are worthy candidates in the existing pipeline. \nJoseph and Lynn are surely positioned to prove his point. \nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL divisional playoff games Facebook Posted!
