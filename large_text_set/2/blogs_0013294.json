The shrine's white floor was still smeared with blood, with scattered debris including shoes, shawls, and baby bottles. \nAt least 20 children are believed to be among the dead, the head of Sehwan's medical facility Moeen Uddin Siddiqui said. \nAt 3.30am the shrine's caretaker stood among the carnage and defiantly rang its bell, a daily ritual that he vowed to continue. \nThe Sindh provincial government announced three days of mourning as Pakistanis vented their grief and fury on social media, bemoaning the lack of medical facilities to help the wounded, with the nearest hospital around 70km from the shrine.
