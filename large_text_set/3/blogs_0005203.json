You can see Scully’s original Instagram post below, in which he calls out casting directors Maida Gregori Boina and Rami Fernandes, who he describes as “serial abusers”.\nAfter Scully heard multiple first-hand reports of more than 150 girls left waiting for over three hours in a dark staircase without light as Boina and Fernandes left the building and went to lunch, he made good on a promise to whistle-blow indecent behavior in the fashion industry, and named and shamed Boina and Fernandes in his post.\nSo true to my promise at #bofvoices that I would be a voice for any models, agents or all who see things wrong with this business I'm disappointed to come to Paris and hear that the usual suspects are up to the same tricks. I was very disturbed to hear from a number of girls this morning that yesterday at the Balenciaga casting Madia & Ramy (serial abusers) held a casting in which they made over 150 girls wait in a stairwell told them they would have to stay over 3 hours to be seen and not to leave. In their usual fashion they shut the door went to lunch and turned off the lights, to the stairs leaving every girl with only the lights of their phones to see. Not only was this sadistic and cruel it was dangerous and left more than a few of the girls I spoke with traumatized. Most of the girls have asked to have their options for Balenciaga cancelled as well as Hermes and Ellie Saab who they also cast for because they refuse to be treated like animals. Balenciaga part of Kering it is a public company and these houses need to know what the people they hire are doing on their behalf before a well deserved law suit comes their way. On top of that I have heard from several agents, some of whom are black that they have received mandate from Lanvin that they do not want to be presented with women of color. And another big house is trying to sneak 15 year olds into paris! It's inconceivable to me that people have no regard for human decency or the lives and feelings of these girls, especially when too too many of these models are under the age of 18 and clearly not equipped to be here but god forbid well sacrifice anything or anyone for an exclusive right? If this behavior continues it's gonna be a long cold week in paris. Please keep sharing your stories with me and I will continue to to share them for you. It seems to be the only way we can force change and give the power back to you models and agents where it rightfully belongs. And I encourage any and all to share this post #watchthisspace \nA post shared by james scully (@jamespscully) on Feb 27, 2017 at 10:40am PST \n\nBalenciaga, which is owned by the French luxury conglomerate Kering, quickly responded by terminating its relationship with Boina and Fernandes on the same day as Scully’s post, issuing a statement that said the company was “making radical changes to the casting process, including discontinuing the relationship with the current casting agency” and that it had sent “a written apology to the agencies of the models who were affected by this specific situation.”\nTales of abuse and exploitation in fashion is nothing new, but Scully’s decision to lift the lid on model abuse by publicly denouncing his colleagues is a rare feat. The accused, Boina and Fernandes, have since responded to Scully’s accusation with a statement that defects blame back to Balenciaga.\n“It is important to stop the spread of rumors and set the record straight,” Maida Gregori tells Business of Fashion . “To directly address these accusations, the models did not wait for three hours in the dark, not even one hour. Balenciaga provided us with the casting facility, and its senior staff was present and actively involved at all times.”\nBoth the fashion press and the industry’s top models have come out in support of Scully’s bold move and added their own two cents. You can see some of the conversation unfold below, including supermodel Edie Campbell’s thoughts on the fiasco.\nThere's an ugly side to the modelling indusry, which is quickly coming to light thanks to James Scully's whistleblowing.

Levi (@DanitTheStylist) March 2, 2017 \n\nDespite Boina and Fernandes’ rebuttal, it’s difficult to simply accept such accusations as hearsay. Most especially when rumors about the mistreatment of models in fashion are nothing new. However, this moment marks a rare occasion where these kinds of accusations have been aired so publicly and vigorously.\nThough Balenciaga was quick to disavow Boina and Fernandes’ misconduct, it’s bizarre to think such a big luxury house wasn’t actively involved in the casting process of its own show, and on hand to prevent the alleged behavior. It isn’t clear whether the house is launching an internal investigation among its own senior staff to see what went wrong.\nScully also called Lanvin, who reportedly told casting directors that they did not want to be presented with models of color. Lanvin has quickly denied the claims. Given that the modeling industry as a whole is plagued by diversity issues, this is hardly surprising. The historic French fashion house presented its FW17 collection at Paris Fashion Week yesterday and featured only two black models (out of 53 looks).\nLanvin’s FW17 menswear show fared slightly better when it came to diversity by including 8 black models (out of 53 looks). Balenciaga is no stranger to diversity controversy either. Demna Gvasalia’s FW16 Balenciaga debut may have been critically acclaimed but many publications hit out at the label’s decision to include an exclusively white cast of models . Since 2014, Gvasalia has also featured zero models of color at his own ultra-hyped label Vetements.\nWhatever the truth is behind Scully’s claims, it seems that the fashion industry has opened a new chapter, one where the bullying, cruelty, racism and discrimination rife in fashion’s modeling industry is no longer facilitated, and the perpetrators can expect to pay the consequences in an age where social media can serve swift justice.\n\nFor more in-depth fashion reportage, read our take on Balenciaga’s diversity issue here . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T13:23:16.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
