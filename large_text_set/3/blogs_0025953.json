Kizer also showed some versatility during Notre Dame's pro day, helping out on special teams, per Strack: Jordan Strack @JordanStrack 3/23/2017, 4:45:29 PM The good news for Kizer is NFL teams will be taken care of in the long-snapper category, so he won't have to hone his skills doing that for much longer. Greg Gabriel, who worked as the scouting director for the Chicago Bears from 2001-10, is a big believer in Kizer's talent translating to the NFL: Greg Gabriel @greggabe DeShone Kizer won't be the first QB drafted, maybe not the 2nd, but in 3 years he will be the best QB to come out of this class. Book it! Coincidentally, Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune reported the Bears are \"expected\" to hold a private workout with Kizer that will likely happen next week. Strack also noted another team with an early pick that was well represented in South Bend: Jordan Strack @JordanStrack 49ers GM John Lynch & Special Exec Martin Mayhew are both in attendance watching DeShone Kizer throw today. 3/23/2017, 4:12:01 PM San Francisco 49ers general manager John Lynch said at the combine Kizer \" blew the doors off\" his interview with the team, per NFL.com's Chase Goodbread . The 49ers own the No. 2 overall pick and need a long-term answer at quarterback with Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley competing for the job in 2017. Without a clear top choice at the quarterback position this year, Kizer has as much of an argument to be the first player at the position off the board as Watson or Trubisky. He was more inconsistent than the other two, but his physical attributes and ceiling have drawn rave reviews. Kizer showed off those unique physical abilities on Thursday and has four more weeks of private workouts with teams to convince them he's the best quarterback to build their future around.
