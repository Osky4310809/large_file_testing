He's very good at analysing football matches on live TV. \nHowever, it seems the former Liverpool centre-back is particularly good at using social media to put peers, colleagues and opponents back in their place. \nTime and again, we have seen other footballers try to have a pop at the Monday Night Football man… and on each and every occasion, we see the Carra take them down in brutal fashion. \nJust check out these 10 examples of brave footballers who saw Carragher put his outstanding Twitter skills to good use… Danny Simpson (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nPerhaps a little peeved at Carragher suggesting Leicester should \"hang their heads in shame\" after their 3-1 win against Liverpool, the Foxes right-back saw an opportunity to have a pop by posting this picture: \nA decent effort. \nUnfortunately for Simpson, he forgot he was taking on the best in the business: \nBURN! (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty Images / Instagram) \nCarragher's favourite past time? Embarrassing Gary Neville on social media, of course. \nTake, for instance, the comment he posted after G-Nev posted a picture of himself getting a haircut. \nHarsh… but probably fair. Phil Neville (Photo: Getty Images) \nGary isn't the only member of the Neville clan who has felt the full force of Carragher's social media skills. His brother Phil has not been spared either. \nBack in January, Neville the younger had been commentating on Tottenham's hugely impressive 2-0 victory over Chelsea, and felt the to tweet his praise for Spurs' (incorrectly spelled) manager Mauricio Pochettino. \nCarra, ever alert, was onto it like a flash, no doubt sensing the chance to get Neville to make a comment about the man currently at the helm of a club close to his heart. \nPhil - who was famously a good cricketer in his youth - wasn't having any of it though, and played Carra's off-spinner with a straight bat. \nBut as Gary would no doubt tell him, you can't keep Carra down for long, and what followed was a classic case of the ex-Liverpool man reeling in his bait. \nNever change, Carra. Never change. Dietmar Hamann \nThe 2005 Champions League-winning team mates got into a Twitter spat back in Decemeber, after Carragher had suggested Liverpool's under-fire goalkeeper Loris Karius should \"shut up\" and concentrate on his performances. \nHamman wasn't impressed. \nSo how did Carra respond? With not one… \n…but two outstanding takedowns. \nTremendous stuff. By the way, if you're wondering what 'Tokyo nick' Carragher is talking about, this should explain it: Video Loading   El Hadji Diouf \nNice and straightforward, this one. The former Liverpool striker - who now seems to spend most of his time slagging off Liverpool - had publicly declared that Carragher was \"a s**t\" and \"a f***ing loser\"… while he was apparently \"a world class player\". \nCue Carra pointing out one revealing fact. \n*pictures Diouf getting back in his box* Rio Ferdinand \nLike Carragher, Ferdinand has gone from legendary, Champions League winning centre-back to one of the finest football pundits in the country. \nUnfortunately for Ferdinand, the similarity between the two of them does not extend to their Twitter trolling abilities. Just check out this exchange from October, ahead of the clash between Liverpool and Man United. \nFerdinand started it, with this pretty blatant bit of goading. \nCarragher, unsurprisingly, was not going to take this lying down. \nOUCH. \nRio manfully tried to hit back… \n…but that simply provoked Carragher into delivering a brutal, crushing, soul-destroying blow: \nAs Jurgen Klopp might say… BOOM! Jose Mourinho (Photo: Getty Images) \nBack in October, Phil Neville (yep, him again) was understandably a little pleased by Man United's 1-0 win against Man City in the League Cup - which is why he posted this: \nSo, what did Carragher do when he saw this? \nHe immediately realised the news Jose Mourinho is STILL living in a hotel, months after his appointment as United boss, presented him with a perfect opportunity to respond. \nBOOM. Alberto Moreno (Photo: Sky Sports/Liverpool FC via Getty) \nAn unusual one, this - for two reasons. Firstly, it's not often Carra goes after a current Liverpool player. And secondly, we can't recall many Carragher tweets which have been SO ferocious, he has then felt the need to delete them. \nMind you, this one - posted during the Spanish left-back's nightmare performance in last year's Europa League Final, was a tad harsh… Everyone who has ever played for Chelsea \nThe 20th anniversary of Gianfranco Zola signing for Chelsea doesn't, at first glance, have much to do with Jamie Carragher. \nHowever, The Blues' tribute to the little Italian included a video of him skipping past a flailing Carragher: \nQuick as a flash, Carra was quick to remind Chelsea of a time when his side did get the better of the Blues. \nTweeting a image of his ex-teammate Luis Garcia and a BRILLIANT banner, he took Chelsea back to one of the worst nights in their history when Luis Garcia's 'ghost goal' beat the Blues in the Champions League in 2005. \nSafe to say that may have 'pressed some buttons' at Stamford Bridge. Gary Neville… again… and again… and again (Photo: Sky Sports) \nAs much as he likes to vary his targets, there is no doubt Carragher likes to train his trolling trickery on one specific victim. \nWhat chance does poor Gary Neville stand in the face of this sort of comedy mockery? \nTaking an upcoming event in Hollywood, and using it to take the mick out of Gary Neville's disastrous spell as Valencia manager. \nJamie Carragher: football's new king of social media banter.
