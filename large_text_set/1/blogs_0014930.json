If Annastacia Palaszczuk doesn’t reverse this legislation ... if elected we will,” he said. media_camera Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls slammed the lockout as a “nanny state” law that would put the vibrancy of the valley at risk along with jobs. Picture: Sarah Marshall \nThe lockout is due to come into force on February 1 in the state’s nightclub precincts. \nIt is the second phase of the government’s anti alcohol-fuelled violence laws. \nDrinking hour restrictions and a ban on rapid consumption drinks like shots after midnight were brought in on July 1 last year. \nThe government is expected to receive a report on how its laws are tracking this week before making a call on whether to scrap or alter the lockout component. \nMeanwhile late-night operators in one of Queensland’s busiest party districts say business has fallen by up to 50 per cent since new legislation designed to curb alcohol-fuelled violence was brought in six months ago. \nFortitude Valley dive bar manager Otis Noble said on Wednesday earnings at his venue were down 15 to 20 per cent, while others had dropped by almost half. \n“Bars have already started to close, so it’s definitely a downturn in business and it’s not just nightclubs and venues who are affected,” he said. \nMr Noble, who is also a member of the Keep Queensland Open group, said the state government had not consulted with the industry before the first tranche of measures were introduced on July 1, 2016. media_camera Star Mason, Erin Bush, and Shayla Thomas-Raihi enjoying a drink at the Regatta Hotel, Toowong.
