Provided Covington's Braxton Brewing is opening a second location on the eve of its second anniversary to focus on new craft beer styles. The brewery is opening the Braxton Labs as a brewery and taproom inside of Party Source in Bellevue, taking over the space that Ei8ht Ball Brewing is vacating on April 1. Braxton is shooting to be open in the new Labs space by this summer. Braxton Brewing Co. is opening a new facility focusing on innovation this summer. Provided \"It's going to look and feel very much like Braxton, it's going to be a Braxton brewery with Braxton employees, but it will exist solely to push the envelope in terms of innovation and flavors,\" CEO Jake Rouse told me. \"Innovation is what makes craft beer great. We came out with Graeter's Black Raspberry Chip Milk Stout (in January) and people are still asking for it. We think having a facility where we can do nothing but try amazing things and pair it with our growth here lets us create a path that allows us to become a major player in craft beer.\" Ei8ht Ball Brewing announced its closing in January. The Ei8ht Ball brand and its beers are dying, but Braxton is buying its equipment and taking over the lease to start Braxton Labs. That will allow Braxton to beef up its production in the original Covington brewery – it's currently at capacity brewing about 15,000 barrels in 2017 – while shifting its experimental brewing to the new space. Rouse didn't disclose the amount of investment in Braxton Labs but said after adding new tanks in Covington and adding 10 new jobs between its two facilities as part of the expansion Braxton will have invested more than $1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Head brewer Evan Rouse said Braxton isn't going to limit itself in what goes on at the new 1,500-barrel facility. It won't be just a sour facility or a barrel-aging facility. \"We're going to brew a little bit of everything,\" he said. \"There'll be off-the-wall things, things you don't typically see on tap here. Everything from imperial to triple IPAs to barrel aging true wild sours – things that will make the beer geeks come and see what we can do when we're putting our brewers and team to the test.\" Braxton Labs will have 40 beers on tap – those will include guest beers from other breweries – and an outdoor space that will be converted to a beer garden down the road. Braxton is going to open up the space as well. Thematically, Braxton is heavily into the garage motif, having itself been born out of a garage home-brew operation, so the new Labs is going to follow that tradition with a laboratory feel. Party Source\"> The expansion comes just as Braxton prepares to celebrate its two-year anniversary. Braxton held Kickstarter's most successful brewery campaign ever in 2014, raising $71,885. It officially opened its doors in March 2015. Evan Rouse told me he's most proud of the team Braxton has been able to build, going from four original employees to more than 40 today, while Jake Rouse said he's most proud of the role Braxton has been able to play in Covington's revitalization. \"All of our growth, our employees, that's amazing, but none of us would have thought that Braxton would be synonymous with Covington's rebirth and we don't take that for granted,\" he said.
