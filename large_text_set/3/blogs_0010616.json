Will was left facing a very hard decision (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nJason and Michelle were saved in the public vote, but it was up to Will to save his third and final singer going into the final. \nKeeping the audience on tenterhooks, and even winding -up Emma Willis with his inability to make a tough decision, the show stalwart whispered after an agonising few minutes that Tanya was hi pick. \nThat meant that a devastated, Lia, Hayley and Clara were kicked out of the competition - though Will declared: \"This is for the show and has nothing to do with how I feel about you as an artist.\" \nAnd it's certainly easy to see how Will found it so hard to choose, as all six acts gave the judges food for thought in the show. \nKicking things off first on the live show was Tanya, who sung a powerful rendition of Sigma and Paloma Faith's Changing - wowing all four mentors. \nWhile Will could barely express his regret at having not turned around for the talented songwriter in the first stage of the show, he declared she'd done him proud on the night. \nGavin Rossdale appeared blown-away by the song, and declared he'd become \"emotionally invested\" in it. \nJennifer Hudson was in agreement, as was Sir Tom Jones, who declared she'd given a \"professional performance\". Tanya was spell-binding (Photo: Rex Features) Hayley's rendition of I Need You Now left some judges wanting a little more (Photo: Rex Features) \nNext up was Hayley Eccles, who was given I Need You Now by Lady Antebellum to perform. \nImproving with every outing, the hopeful was heaped with praise - though the mentors help back with heaps of praise. \n\"I love how she can take something and put her own direction into it,\" gushed Will following the song. \nTom gave her some guidance following her effort, telling Hayley: \"You could get a little looser, you did really well though.\" \nLikewise, Gaven said: \"I hear what Tom is saying. I think the audience really helped you.\" \nThough he added encouragingly: \"every time you keep getting better and better.\" \nJason Jones, Will's only male act left, was next up on the stage, and gave Arian Grande's Into You his very own spin. \nBlown away by the song, Will exclaimed: \"You’re voice is so incredible. if i had a voice like yours i would sing with no shirt on.\" \nAnd an admiring Tom said Jason had only got \"stronger\", while Jennifer praised him for his \"own unique smoothness\". \nFollowing the glowing praise, Jason himself said: \"That was the best feeling.\" \nLia White performed Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Want To Have Fun, putting an acoustic spin on the '80s classic. \nAfter being initially unsure about Will's pick, she was heaped with praise - with Jennifer in particular giving her huge kudos. \nShe said: \"You are so adorable. you remind me of Solange [Knowles], and I don’t know if you know who Aliyah is, but you remind me of her.\" \nAnd Gavin was an equally big fan, simply stating: \"It’s been done to death, and you were really smart to do it your own way. In the short time you were on stage you went from super intimate to busting wicked moves.\" Clara Hurtado gave a stand-out performance with Alarm by Anne Marie, but it wasn't just her voice wowing - as her stage presence bowled the judges over. \n\"That dress and the way you sang that, that is fire,\" panted Will after the exhilarating number. \nEven host Emma Willis was unable to hide her admiration either, as she chirped\" she’s so hot. \nGavin added that \"she is the entire package\", before adding: \"You look incredible, you sound great… it’s just so special. Will is right, the red dress is special.\" \n\"I think it’s all been said. I loved it,\" gushed Tom. In response a humble Clara said: \"I was so nervous, so im glad that i powered through it.\" \nMichelle was the last act up, singing Bonnie Ray's I Can't Make You Love Me, but was nervous as a bad throat had been plaguing her all week. \nShe needn't have worried though as she received a standing ovation from the audience. \nTom declared that he \"really loved\" the song, while Gavin said: \"You’ve got this split personality. You have this tension when you come to rehearsals. You should know that when you come through- for you, your voice is extraordinary.\" \nWhile will told her: \"That performance felt like a lifetime of what people should be seeing.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-12T00:07:55.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
