Read More The cost of prescriptions is set to rise again - what you'll pay instead \nHealth minister Philip Dunne previously said prescription charges would rise “broadly in line with inflation”. \nHowever, those with prescription prepayment certificates (PPC) - which caps the price for those who need regular medication - will see their costs frozen for another year. \nThe hike has been criticised by campaigners who claim it could lead to more patients failing to collect prescriptions because of the “expense”. \nMorgan Vine, of Parkinson’s UK who Co-Chair the Prescription Charges Coalition said: “This will come as a blow to people with long term conditions, who already have to deal with additional living costs, and rely on regular medication to manage their condition.\" \nThe Health Minister has previously referred to a series of exemptions - including the NHS Low Income Scheme for those who are struggling to make ends meet, but what are they- and do you qualify for any? \nWe've broken these down in full below. 1. Prescriptions aren't always the cheapest option You may be able to buy over the counter instead (Photo: Getty) \nIf your medication is available 'over the counter', you may want to talk to your chemist about buying it outright, rather than through your prescription. \nThis is because counter medications are sold at the RRP, not the minimum prescription charge (currently £8.40, soon to be £8.60), and so if the RRP of your medication is lower, you could pay the cheaper price instead. \nNext time you're picking up a prescription, ask your pharmacist if it's available over the counter. If the answer is yes, ask for a comparison of the costs, and opt for the cheaper one. \nAn example of this is a pack of antihistamine hay fever tablets - which would cost £8.40 through a prescriiption. Buy over the counter however, and you could pay anything from £2.99 (pack of seven) - to £11.49 (pack of 60) in Boots. 2. Are you eligible for free prescriptions? If you meet the minimum requirements, you may not need to pay at all (Photo: Getty) \nIf you are under 16 or over 60, aged 16-18 and in full-time education, pregnant (and hold a Maternity Exemption certificate ), or on income support, you can get free prescriptions. \nAll you need to do is tick the relevant box on the back of your prescription form when you pick your medicine up from the pharmacist. \nYou are also entitled to free prescriptions if you or your partner – including civil partner – receives the following: Income Support Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, or Pension Credit Guarantee Credit \nUniversal Credit 3. What about a Prescription Prepayment Certificate? If you need more than 3 prescriptions a quarter, there's a cheaper option you should consider (Photo: Matt Cardy) \nIf you need more than 12 prescribed medicines each year, you could save money with a 12-month Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC). \nYou can also buy a three-month PPC, which will save you money if you need more than three prescribed medicines in three months. \nThe charge for a single prescribed medicine is £8.40, whereas a three-month PPC will cost you £29.10 and a 12-month PPC £104.00. poll loading Have you collected a prescription in the past 6 months? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO \nThe government says this can save those who require regular medication as much as £295 in a year - or even more once the price hikes. \nAnyone in England can get a PPC. The annual subscription can be paid in 10 monthly instalments, which means you will pay £10.40 a month to get unlimited prescriptions. 4. Ask for a bulk prescription It may be cheaper to request all your medication in one go (Photo: GETTY) \nGPs tend to distribute prescriptions one-by-one - or each time you have an appointment, but, if you regularly require the same medication, you can make savings by requesting them in bulk. \nYou'll have to ask your GP to authorise this first, but, if you have a repeat prescription, instead of paying £8.40-60 each time, you'll just pay once. This can save you a fortune. 5. Don't fall for the Nurofen trick \nNurofen, Lemsip, Anadin, Sudafed, and Clarityn cost as much as almost eight times what you'd pay for supermarket and chemists' own brands – despite being exactly as effective at treating pain, hay fever and colds. \nResearch from MoneySavingExpert found many big brand products also have precisely the same ingredients as their cheaper alternatives – meaning you're paying for packaging and marketing and nothing more. \n\"What really counts is the active ingredient. That’s the stuff that does the job,\" said Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert. \n\"If it’s the same, sticking with branded drugs doesn’t give extra aid to your health, it just hurts your wealth - with massive mark-ups that go to pay for their adverts and profits.\" poll loading Do you buy branded drugs? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO \nThe cheapest supermarket Nurofen costs £1.98 for 16 tablets at Asda, but its own brand costs as little as 25p – that's 792% more. Both contain 200mg of ibuprofen and offer the same pain relief. \nMeanwhile, generic paracetamol costs as little as 19p a pack while un-branded aspirin costs just 30p – by contrast, you can pay £1.65 for Panadol or Anadin.
