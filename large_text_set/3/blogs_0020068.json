( PEP ) has increased the compensation pay of Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi by 13%, to $29.8 million in 2016. \nAccording to a regulatory filing on Friday, the 61-year-old CEO received $14.4 million in cash bonuses and $8.91 million in stock awards last year. Nooyi’s compensation package also included her $1.73 million salary and reflects the fourth consecutive pay raise for the long-serving executive. Consumer Preferences Guide New Focus \nIn the most recent fourth quarter, the Purchase, N.Y.-based beverage giant beat the Street’s earnings expectations, attributing stronger-than-expected financials for the quarter to success in a new health focus. PepsiCo now generates about 45% of its revenue from its “guilt-free” product line.

In India, retailers in southern states have joined together to boycott Pepsi and rival Coca Cola Co. ( KO ) as they attribute depleted ground water resources to the beverage companies’ operations. \nThe news of Nooyi’s pay increase comes as the fight against a new local soda tax has escalated in Philadelphia. The Associated Press says an “Ax the Bev Tax” social media campaign has gained significant traction in a measure aimed to squash the new legislation in court or through appeal. While Pepsi and its beverage peers may be fighting back against the new laws, warning that new legislation will force them to cut jobs at home, the leaders have no choice but to follow consumers’ changing preferences through innovation and new health-oriented products.
