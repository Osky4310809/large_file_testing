At CES , we're getting a detailed look at what's on offer with this year's high-end SoC. The 835 is slated to be the first ARM processor to run Windows 10 , and as such it merits a detailed look.\nThe shift to 10nm means that the overall size of the Snapdragon 835 is 30% smaller than that of the Snapdragon 820, and the node shift brings improvements in energy efficiency to the tune of 40%. Qualcomm is also touting a performance increase of 27% over the previous generation.\n\nWe'll go into detail on each aspect of the SoC, but in broad strokes, here's what's new with the Snapdragon 835: eight Kryo 280 CPU cores, Adreno 540 GPU, DirectX 12 support, gigabit LTE modem, multi-gigabit Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, Hexagon 682 DSP, Spectra 180 ISP, support for HDR10 video, Quick Charge 4.0, and Qualcomm's Aqstic codec with 32-bit/384kHz support and aptX/aptX HD Bluetooth audio.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:50:09.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
