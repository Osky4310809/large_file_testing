For what it's worth, President Nixon released his tax returns while being audited back in 1973.\nHowever, this past weekend White House advisor Kellyanne Conway took an even harder stance regarding the release of Trump's taxes saying, \"He's not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care.\"\n\nConway's comments prompted some online to declare that there was a need to show the president how much Americans do care about his taxes, with one Twitter user suggesting that the next major protest be held on Tax Day, April 18.\n\nThe tweet spread fast online, and currently has almost 40,000 likes and nearly 20,000 retweets.\nCelebrities like Patton Oswalt and Billy Eichner have already jumped on board with the potential march.\n\nThe march last weekend reportedly brought over 3 million protesters out into the streets in countries all around the world looking to express their trepidation regarding the new Trump administration.\nWhile there seems to be enthusiasm around the prospects of a Tax Day march, it's currently unclear if any official steps have been taken.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T11:24:25.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
