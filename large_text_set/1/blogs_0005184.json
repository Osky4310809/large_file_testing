From a vertiginous Chilean home accessible only by boat to an unbelievable house-in-a-cliff with dizzying sea views, these daring homes make the most of their dramatic landscapes. Hit the jump to take a tour of homes perched high on cliffs, often in places where no buildings have ever been built before. Casa del Ancantilado by Gil Bartolomé Architects \nThis crazy cliff house might look like something from a fantasy novel, but we assure you it’s totally real. Buried into a hillside in Salobreña, Spain, the Casa del Ancantilado was designed by Gil Bartolomé Architects to look like a dragon emerging from the steep slope with openings that overlook beautiful views of the Mediterranean Sea. The curvaceous and cavernous dwelling is covered in metal mesh formwork to mimic the scales of a dragon. Till House by WMR Arquitectos \nWant to live in a home that’s hidden away from sight but still boasts spectacular vistas? WMR Arquitectos designed the Till House for a couple who wanted just that—a beautiful hidden home perched high on a cliff overlooking jaw-dropping Pacific Ocean views. Built from locally-sourced timber and powered by solar energy, the Till House was designed to disappear into the Chilean coast—it’s near impossible to spot from the road—and minimize impact on its cliff site where no buildings have ever been built before. Casa Brutale by OPA \nNo list about cliffside homes would be complete without this incredible house-in-a-cliff project. This amazing concrete home—which is actually being built after the renderings went viral in 2015—is the work of OPA and would be set in a cliff overlooking the Aegean Sea. The Bond villain-like lair will be built underground and topped with a roof-mounted swimming pool that spills over the edge to a full-height window with stunning views. Cliff House by MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects \nMacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects designed Cliff House, a Nova Scotia weekend retreat that was created to simulate the “experience of flying off [a] cliff.” Partly projected off a rocky slope, this minimalist cabin is wrapped in glazing to maximize natural light and views of the Atlantic coastline. The structure’s daring position adds drama to this unusual retreat and helps minimize site impact. House on Todos los Santos Lake by Apio Arquitectos \nThis gorgeous cliffside home stands apart not just for its stunning volcano and lake views, but also for its remote and difficult-to-reach location. Only accessible via boat, this isolated cabin perched high on a cliff is set back inside a forested hillside and faces envy-inducing views of Chile’s blue-green Todos los Santos Lake ringed by snow-capped mountains. Designed by Apio Arquitectos , the home serves as a weekend retreat and was built largely from timber and water-resistant metal plates. Triangle Cliff House by Matthias Arndt \nGerman art expert Matthias Arndt designed the Triangle Cliff House, a design that’s only conceptual but is too eye-catching not to include in our roundup. In his renderings, the A-frame house straddles a misty cliff for amazing views from the lower level. Windows wrap around the home on three sides to offer views in almost all directions.
