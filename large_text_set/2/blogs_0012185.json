From Humana's press release (emphasis added): \n\" All of these actions were taken with the expectation that the company’s Individual Commercial business would stabilize to the point where the company could continue to participate in the program.

Therefore, the company has decided that it cannot continue to offer this coverage for 2018. Through the remainder of 2017, Humana remains committed to serving its current members across 11 states where it offers Individual Commercial products.\" \nMore to come... \nSEE ALSO: Cigna is suing Anthem for $13 billion after walking away from their merger NOW WATCH: Here's how to use one of the many apps to buy and trade bitcoin   Affordable Care Act Obamacare Obamacare Repeal Humana Aetna", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:57:12.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
