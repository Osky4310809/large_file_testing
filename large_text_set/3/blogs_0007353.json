In a police report from 2015, Heming told authorities, \"I wouldn't use that much to kill him, but just enough to make him not have an erection.\" Andrea Heming to police, \"I just wanted to use enough(poison) to make him not have an erection.\" @News3LV pic.twitter.com/4XKKARXjRq — Antonio Castelan (@AntonioNews3LV) March 1, 2017 \nHer husband, identified as \"Ralph,\" claims that he had continuous headaches and diarrhea in the six months leading up to his wife being caught. However, Heming was never picked up by police; she has been on the run for the last two years. Officials now believe she is hiding out in Mexico. \nHeming put boric acid, a common insecticide used on roaches and termites, into her husband's cereal, whipped cream, and energy drinks. \nJudging by his diet, it seems like health may have already been on the line. \nIf you spot Andrea, don't let her make you a bowl of Lucky Charms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T01:26:26.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
