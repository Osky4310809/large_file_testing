(Following is a 60-second version.): \nScott Ferguson again directed the spots, and Al Wyatt is the writer. Other STLers on the crew were Sean Funcik , Bart Elfrink , Tim Donsbach , Brian Verbarg , Ryann Brannan and Linda Schumacher . \nThe actors in \"Safe\" are Michael James Reed; Anna Lang; Daniel Lang; Michael Arens; and Kate Jones . In \"Smart Phone,\" the cast consists of: Jacqueline Thompson ; Marie Tagbo ; Emily Schroder ; Shannon Williams ; and Charlisa Wright . \nIn 2016, local actress Tori Giessing starred as a high-school cheerleader who loses her family, friends and self-respect after getting hooked on heroin. She is the daughter of George \"Skip\" and Leah Giessing of Kirkwood. \nIn 2015, the commercial starred Kirsten \"Kiki\" Wylder , a suburban mother who comes home to find her clean-cut son dead from a heroin overdose. The son was played by William Swanson , son of local casting director Kim Swanson . \nJoe Holleman • 314-340-8254", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:56:33.983+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
