I wish I could write the world’s greatest obituary for Chuck Berry , the Godfather of Rock and Roll, a man who did more for music than most people will ever know. But I’m simply not the man for that job.\nI’ll leave the writing of Chuck Berry obituaries to the New York Times . Seriously, do yourself a favor and read that after watching the music video above.\nI appreciate Heavy Metal, and I’ve been to quite a few Metal shows over the years, but if I’m being honest with you bros it’s definitely not my top genre of music (or even in the top 5). That’s why I was so taken aback by this badass cover of ‘Johnny B. Goode’ by Chuck Berry. It’s the song that Chuck’s arguably known best for, and it’s a song that has been covered by thousands of bands all across the planet.\nThis Heavy Metal cover of ‘Johnny B. Goode’ by Leo Moracchioli is a pretty novel approach to a song that we all know and love, and it adds a new element to one of the greatest Rock and Roll songs ever written.\nAnother favorite cover version of ‘Johnny B. Goode’ comes from my favorite band, the boys from Vermont. I’m talking of course about Phish. But this cover is definitely an acquired taste:\n\nBig shout out to TastefullyOffensive.com for finding and sharing this heavy metal cover of Johnny B. Goode! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T22:13:45.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
