We also increased forecast amounts to 3-6 inches in our south and east areas in Stafford, Charles, southern Anne Arundel and northern Calvert counties. Our updated snowfall map is below: Capital Weather Gang snowfall forecast for Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017. Second version. \nUpdate, 5:00 p.m.: The National Weather Service has extended its winter weather advisory northward, and it now covers the District and the following counties: Fairfax, Prince William, and southern Fauquier. One to three inches of snow are expected in the advisory area. Warnings and advisories issued by National Weather Service. \nOriginal post from 4 p.m. \nIt was a bit colder than expected today, with most spots staying near or below freezing. That helps set the stage for snow that’s on the way. It’ll certainly not have much trouble sticking, meaning slick roads where snow piles up. The bigger question remains just how much might fall. [ Snow likely Saturday in D.C. area, heavy amounts possible in southeast suburbs ] \nThrough Tonight: It’s the calm before the storm this evening and into the night. Other than cold conditions, it’s not too bad out there. We could see some random snow flakes at times as early as the evening, but anything that is substantial holds off until later. Eventually, light snow spreads into the area during the pre-dawn hours. Snow is probably occurring most spots by near or shortly after sunrise. Lows are in the upper teens to mid-20s. \nView the current weather conditions at The Washington Post. \nTomorrow (Saturday): Most or all of the area is seeing light snow during the morning. Exceptions may be far northwest suburbs, where it’s possible it’ll stay dry. And as one heads south or east of the city, snow intensity picks up. Even in the lighter snow across the immediate area, there could be shorter bursts of heavier stuff as well. It could be a rather fluffy snow, too. By midday, snow should be breaking up and beginning to move east, but it may linger into the afternoon. Snow should totally wind down and move away during the afternoon, or early evening at the latest. \nIn the immediate area, snow totals should range from one to three inches, although these totals could increase if the storm tracks closer to the region or decrease to less than an inch if the storm shifts east. Much higher amounts are possible as one goes further southeast, and there could be little to nothing on the ground well north and west. Trends of late have been for the storm to get closer. We’ll see if that continues. \nWith all the clouds and snow, high temperatures should mainly end up in the mid-20s to near 30. Winds will increase during the morning and be gusty much of the day. They’re sustained around 20 mph with gusts past 30 mph possible. That means wind chills in the teens. \nSunday: Sunshine should be plentiful. That’s about the only good news here. It’s going to be windy and cold. After starting the day in the teens, highs only reach the mid-20s to near 30. Add in north and northwest winds sustained as 20 to 25 mph, and it’s looking like a good day to spend indoors. Colorful skies at the Jefferson Memorial.
