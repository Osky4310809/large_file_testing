At which point, of course, I knew I‚Äôd have to write about it.\n‚ÄúLook, I just create useful content for people. Do that, get it read, get it shared, get links, have good hosting and fast page-load times ‚Ä¶ and productive search engine results will follow, right? I mean, what else is there to say?‚Äù\nTurns out, plenty.\nKeyword research is more fundamental to your content marketing strategy than you may think. Also, you may already be making fatal optimization mistakes . Plus, who knew SEO advice could be so ‚Ä¶ practical ? (Including #8, which will punch you square between the eyes.)\nI read those articles, rethought my position, and decided to examine exactly how much I actually think about SEO on a post-by-post basis.\nAnd, turns out, plenty. (Whether or not I realized it.)\nIt‚Äôs easy to forget about the basic steps I‚Äôm going to outline below, but they shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. Because the minute I stop doing them is the minute my content starts attracting fewer targeted visitors. Same goes for you.\nSo let‚Äôs start at the top, because the first one is by far the most important of the seven ‚Äî and it will take me the longest to explain.\n( Note: I‚Äôm going to use my site AssemblyCall.com as an example throughout this post. It‚Äôs built on the Rainmaker Platform , which has all of the tools I‚Äôm about to mention built right in. And thank goodness, or I‚Äôd probably forget about them. StudioPress Sites has all of these tools built in, too.)\n1. Be extra intentional about your SEO title tag You don‚Äôt have to set an SEO title tag for each post. If nothing is defined in your post‚Äôs meta data, search engines will simply pull your on-page headline.\nAnd if you‚Äôve done your headline homework and know how to write good ones, chances are your headline can double as your SEO title without massive negative repercussions.\nBut is it ideal? That‚Äôs the question. (It‚Äôs not.) And if it‚Äôs not, why wouldn‚Äôt you take an extra minute to be more intentional with your SEO title?\nLet me give you an example ‚Ä¶\nHere‚Äôs a recent post from AssemblyCall.com. Backstory: our resident expert bracketologist posted his final projections for the NCAA Men‚Äôs Basketball Tournament.\nThe headline follows the same simple and straightforward pattern that you see on all of our bracketology posts.\nBut here is the SEO title, set from the post edit screen inside of Rainmaker:\nYou can‚Äôt see the full title, but here it is:\nMarch Madness: Final Bracket Projections for 2017 NCAA Tournament by @AndyBottoms.\nSo why the differences?\nFirst, because ‚ÄúMarch Madness‚Äù is an oft-searched term by basketball fans seeking this information ‚Äî which I know from having done my keyword research . But the headline ‚ÄúMarch Madness: Final 2017 NCAA Tournament Bracket Projections‚Äù would look goofy and cluttered at the top of the page, especially on mobile.\nAdding it to the SEO title allows me to get it into the search result, where it will have the most impact.\nSecond, I know that the first five to six words in an SEO title are the most important real estate. After that, people may not see the rest because it can get truncated in search results (as you can see in the screenshot).\nSo I rearranged the on-page headline to get ‚ÄúFinal Bracket Projections‚Äù in before ‚Äú2017 NCAA Tournament.‚Äù Why? Because the latter phrase is somewhat redundant with ‚ÄúMarch Madness.‚Äù But it‚Äôs essential that searchers know what, specifically, this post will tell them about March Madness, otherwise they won‚Äôt click.\nThis arrangement of the words balances the more generally searched terms with the essential specifics about the content ‚Äî which is the part that actually drives clicks.\nThird, notice the Twitter handle (@AndyBottoms) there at the end. Did you know that when people click the share button to tweet your post, Twitter usually pulls the SEO title, not the on-page headline? It‚Äôs true.\nSince Andy is a known entity among college basketball fans for his bracketology prowess, I included his Twitter handle to add authority to the link when it‚Äôs included in the tweet text. Plus, he‚Äôll be alerted when someone shares it and can retweet the share or reach out to that person.\nThree small, subtle differences. All important. And each opportunity would have been wasted if I‚Äôd just been happy with the on-page headline and not considered the SEO title.\nAnd here‚Äôs the fun part: It took me way longer to type this, and for you to read this, than it did for me to edit the headline for the SEO title. I‚Äôve been at this for a while, so it‚Äôs second nature at this point. So much so that I sometimes take it for granted.\nIf you haven‚Äôt developed this habit yet, take it seriously. Start doing it. And once it‚Äôs a habit, you‚Äôll be creating usefully distinct SEO titles in less time than it takes you to floss.\n2. While you‚Äôre at it, be strategic with your meta description too You might as well take a minute to define your meta description. Typically, this is what shows along with your SEO title in search engine results.\nSure, search engines sometimes take liberties and pull their own excerpt from inside of your post for the meta description ‚Äî usually when the search result is generated by a keyword that is not in the meta description but appears elsewhere in your content.\nBut we can‚Äôt worry about that. We‚Äôre worrying about the results we can control.\nSee how I used the phrase ‚ÄúNCAA Tournament bracket projections‚Äù in the screenshot above? I did this to ensure that the ‚ÄúNCAA Tournament‚Äù part was visible in the search engine result, since the addition of ‚ÄúMarch Madness‚Äù to the SEO title had pushed ‚ÄúNCAA Tournament‚Äù toward the cutoff point. (Remember from my first example?)\nI also wanted to include the phrase ‚Äúfield of 68,‚Äù which is a tertiary phrase that might draw some search interest.\nThe meta description is important because it‚Äôs your second chance to include important keywords that might not make it into your title tag.\nIn hindsight, I probably could have been even more strategic with keywords in this description. I had more real estate available. But I was also trying to balance my tone and connecting with the audience ‚Äî because, remember, the meta description often auto-populates when someone shares your post on Facebook.\nThis was a good opportunity to display some gratitude to the loyal audience members who had kept up with Andy‚Äôs daily updates throughout the previous week.\nAnd don‚Äôt forget: optimizing for humans is optimizing for search engines. üòâ\n3. Decide if your post will need a 301 redirect in the future What if you write a post that has a short shelf life and you want it to be available in search engines during that short time frame when it‚Äôs relevant?\nCool. Write it. Publish it. (Add a good SEO Title!) Enjoy the traffic and attention.\nBut what do you do when the short shelf life ends? Add a 301 redirect.\nBelow is an example of a limited-time offer we presented a few weeks ago. Focus on the last bullet point.\nNotice the part about the offer expiring on March 5? Okay ‚Ä¶ so what happens if someone visits this post after March 5? The offer is no longer valid, but the search result will still live on in Google and elsewhere.\nWhich is fine. I‚Äôll take the traffic. I just want visitors to end up somewhere they can take action.\nSo I have two options:\nI can update the post with a more timeless call to action (a reasonable choice). I can simply redirect the post to another page on the site. In this case, I took the latter option because I wanted to send people to the main page for our Deal of the Week posts, which has a timeless call to action ( you can see it here ).\nYes, sometimes optimizing search results is about going back to old posts and ensuring a visitor gets something useful when they click.\n(By the way, you‚Äôll notice we do the same thing here at Copyblogger with posts that have expired offers.)\nOr perhaps, you don‚Äôt want some posts indexed by search engines at all ‚Ä¶\n4. See if you should add a ‚Äúnoindex‚Äù tag And that‚Äôs when a noindex tag comes in handy.\nSay that I had wanted the post referenced above to never appear in search engines at all, but just on the site. I could have added a noindex tag to it using the same SEO tool I used to add the 301 redirect.\nWhen is it a smart time to add a noindex tag?\nMaybe you have a special offer that is only for people already in your audience, but not for newcomers or window shoppers. Maybe you want to make a special announcement to your existing readers, and you even want to post about it on social media, but it wouldn‚Äôt have any relevance for a new search engine visitor. Maybe you‚Äôre trying out a new post format and you want some feedback, so you publish the post, knowing that only your die-hard audience members (daily visitors) will see it. You don‚Äôt want this indexed. I could go on.\nThe point is: Optimizing for search engines also includes determining what posts you don‚Äôt want indexed. The noindex tag gives you some choice in the matter.\n( Important note: The noindex tag is not perfect. Sometimes search engines index the page anyway. So just be careful.)\n5. Use the Canonical URL to let search engines know which page to index For each episode of The Digital Entrepreneur, we post the podcast in two places:\nOnce on Rainmaker.fm ( here ) Once on DigitalCommerce.com ( here ) Why?\nBecause Rainmaker.fm is the network site, which hosts the RSS feeds that podcast aggregators like iTunes use. So we have to publish it there.\nBut we‚Äôd rather visitors go to DigitalCommerce.com, because once on that site they are more likely to start a free membership , which could lead to a paid membership, which hopefully then leads people to the Rainmaker Platform .\nDo you see the issue? Two posts, with very similar content. How do search engines know where to point people?\nWe tell them ‚Äî using the Canonical URL field in the SEO settings.\nSince we want people to end up at the episode page on DigitalCommerce.com, we use that link when we edit the Canonical URL field on the Rainmaker.fm post.\nLike this:\nSo, in theory, and hopefully in practice, the DigitalCommerce.com page is the only one that shows up in search engine results when someone types in a relevant keyword for that content.\nThis tip is important to keep in mind not just when you operate multiple websites, but also when you syndicate your content on other websites.\nSay you syndicate a post on LinkedIn, Medium, or as a guest post on someone else‚Äôs site ‚Äî make sure you point the Canonical URL tag back to the original post on your site.\n6. Commit to doing regular keyword research to confirm your hypotheses We all have hypotheses about the language our audiences use and the terms they search for. Some of us are better informed than others, depending on the quality of the reading and listening we do.\nBut all of us could benefit from regularly stepping back, rolling up our sleeves, and doing good ol‚Äô keyword research.\nAs Brian said :\n‚ÄúLet me be frank ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs simply negligent to not use keyword research to understand the language of your audience so that you can reflect it back to them.‚Äù\nYou‚Äôll greatly benefit from having a tool like this right there at your fingertips while you‚Äôre writing and editing posts:\nHitting ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù provides me with an analysis of the provided keyword phrase, as well as alternate suggestions and their relative popularity and competition level. I can also see useful Google Trends information.\nHow might this be helpful? Well, for example, ‚ÄúSEO tips‚Äù might be provided as an alternative. If it has a higher popularity but a lower competition level, I might consider reworking my headline.\nOr I might look at the alternatives and realize my hypothesis was right.\nEither way, I‚Äôm more informed about the phrases people are actually using, which helps me create more useful content.\nAlso, as an aside, it helps to have a content optimizer:\nI‚Äôd say that page is optimized.\nFull disclosure: I stacked the deck in my favor for the screenshot above by analyzing this post about content marketing from Copyblogger. I mean, how could that post not score 100, right? üòâ\nThe keyword research and content optimizer tools are built into the Rainmaker Platform and StudioPress Sites . I don‚Äôt use them on every post, but I do use them regularly to check myself and make sure the post I‚Äôm working on and my site as a whole are presenting themselves accurately to search engines.\nAnd now, tip number seven ‚Ä¶\n7. Pay attention to your post‚Äôs reading-difficulty level Remember our most important premise when it comes to SEO: optimizing for people is optimizing for search engines.\nA big part of optimizing for people is using language that can be easily understood. How sophisticated that language should be depends on the audience and context.\nFor example, the reading level for a website about fantasy football probably shouldn‚Äôt be the same as, say, The New Yorker. Audience expectations are very different.\nBut how do you know the reading level of your post? I check it using the content optimizer tool I showed you above.\nThe reading-difficulty level for this post is ‚ÄúStandard.‚Äù\nI checked the reading-difficulty level for one of our bracketology posts at AssemblyCall.com. It was ‚ÄúVery Difficult.‚Äù I‚Äôm fairly certain we don‚Äôt need an article about bracket predictions to be more sophisticated than a post about SEO. That was a useful check.\nHow does this relate to SEO? Well, one of the factors that has been given increasing importance in search engines over the last few years is the level of activity people actually have with your content.\nIf people click your link, start reading, and then find they are not connecting with your material because you‚Äôre using big words and talking over them, what are they likely to do? Click the Back button and find another post. Search engines will take note of that.\nEnsuring that your content is at a reading level appropriate for your audience will give you a greater likelihood of connecting, keeping visitors engaged, and improving your stature with search engines.\nWhich, after all, is the ultimate goal ‚Äî and in that order.\nYou don‚Äôt improve your stature with search engines and then keep visitors engaged and connect better.\nYou connect and engage first, watch your search rankings improve, and then make smart, subtle tweaks like the ones I described above to make your search results even more effective.\nWhat other SEO steps do you habitually take with all or most of your posts?
