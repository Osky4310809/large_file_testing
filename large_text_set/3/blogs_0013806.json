Mac and Jeff had been in a heated argument all week, so we decided to settle it with a little competition. Whoever could get the most hashtags in their favor in one hour would get the last say in the argument and the loser would be “belko’d” in front of the entire audience. 7 \nWithin one hour, Jeff managed to pull in over 1700 hashtags in his favor. Mac pulled in zero. Yes, he couldn’t get one single person to side with him…. shocking. As punishment, he was forced to wear this ridiculous costume and serve drinks to everyone during the screening. Aside from Mac’s snarky complaints while serving all of us cocktails, The Belko Experiment was awesome. Make sure to check it out in theaters this Friday, March 17th! 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:47:28.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
