He recalls making his India debut about seven years ago, saying that his set at Blue Frog in 2010 was the best, adding, “I played in Pune, Bengaluru as well, but those weren’t so well-organised. The crowd was good, but small. It's frustrating when you come all the way to give your best sound to people, but there are problems with the equipment, or the sound is not right, or if the show hasn’t been promoted properly. That put me away from the couple of times I was going to come [to India].” \nThe seasoned producer returned to India once he was assured that the right names – in this case, fellow underground music promoter and DJ Ankytrixx – were on board to bring him down. \nCattaneo, the seasoned producer who’s considered one of the first to kickstart the underground dance music movement in South America, was back in the country last week. He performed in four cities between February 23 and 26, 2017 including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Goa, and Hyderabad. \nIt was a tight schedule, and this time Cattaneo made sure he picked his tours very carefully, especially the ones far away from his home-base of Buenos Aires. \nBut he had a good time in India this time, he confessed. \"Well, I had the first day and the last day off. The first in Mumbai, I went around there and had a really good time. It was good to be back in the city. And the last day, I stayed in Goa after the last show in Hilltop.” For a guy who’s performed everywhere from the legendary Fabric Club in London to the even more legendary Burning Man Festival in the US, Cattaneo started from scratch in his city, and probably his country as well. \nHe joked with modesty when asked about the title of “founding father” though. He said, “I think it’s a bit of an exaggeration, maybe [I was the founding father of underground dance music] in South America or Argentina, or maybe in my neighbourhood.” \nCattaneo was in India to promote his latest compilation Balance , which features originals and remixes by the likes of Guy J, Nick Warren, Guy Mantzur and more, on his label Sudbeat. \nExplaining his selection criteria, he said, “When I do compilations, I always try to reflect my sound. Most of them are friends of mine, and also a lot of new kids from South America and all over the world, guys from Russia, everywhere really. It was like a big collaboration, since I wanted this to be on my label. I wanted all the stuff to be fresh and new, so I spoke to them and said, ‘I’m working on this project, would you like to do a track for me?’ and luckily, they were very kind and we worked together for the album.” \nA regular behind the DJ console at festivals and clubs around the globe, Cattaneo agreed that there are visible differences in the attitude of fans and listeners in different parts of the world. And it looks like he has a preference for countries like India that are only now growing up with the culture of electronic dance music. \nHe explained, “Normally, first world countries in Central Europe or America are more used to this [kind of music]. They see DJs every weekend. Countries in South America or Asia--they don’t have much access all the time. They have now, but still, it’s not the same. Normally, you get more from the crowd in places like Beirut or Argentina than you do in places like Western Europe.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:42:08.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
