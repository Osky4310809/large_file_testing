With the willing diligence of any football fan asked to watch great goal after great goal, the fans duly did their job in their thousands, taking their pick and crowning three worthy goals as the crème de la crème. \nFollow the links below to be whisked away and glimpse some delightful efforts from this year, coming from the courts of Colombia to the pitches of Papua New Guinea, via some scorchers in Jordan. \nSuphawut Thueanklang, Thailand vs Cuba at the FIFA Futsal World Cup Colombia 2016 \nThe first standalone FIFA tournament of the year, the globe’s stars of the futsal court descended on Colombia to show their stuff during the indoor showcase which left us with some sumptuous pieces of skill, ingenuity and opportunism when it came to choosing the best goals, once the silverware had been handed out. Ultimately, it was a familiar name who came out on top. \nHaving been crowned four years earlier on home soil with a rocket fired from an acute angle , Suphawut Thueanklang proved he has plenty of facets to his game by bagging his second Futsal World Cup goal of the tournament title in an altogether different fashion. While the delivery – a long throw from the keeper – was the same, the execution certainly was not, this time using dancing feet and a devilishly deft touch to mesmerise Cuba goalkeeper Nelson Johnston before slotting beyond him in an 8-5 win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-12-31T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:10:57.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
