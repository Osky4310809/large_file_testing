There's a joke around Bosnia and sniper fire to be written here somewhere… #BowlingGreen https://t.co/qPAx8uft0k \n— Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) February 3, 2017 As we all know, lying about acts of violence like, say, coming under sniper fire in Bosnia, is a very dishonest and bad thing to do. https://t.co/aVYPFNQqol \n— T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) February 3, 2017 Your mom lied about coming under sniper fire in Bosnia. https://t.co/mLvrq3ASH4 \n— Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) February 3, 2017 Glad your mom survived the gunfire in Bosnia. https://t.co/pJzOqUZOjH \n— Tim Carney (@TPCarney) February 3, 2017 \nAnd for certain there were references to Benghazi. Just happy her mom survived the shooting in Bosnia, sorry we lost a US Ambassador under her during a made up protest over a movie. https://t.co/3DiBeCO2FM \n— Rich Kelsey (@RichKelsey) February 3, 2017 . @ChelseaClinton True. Let me ask Chris, Glen, Tyrone & Sean how they feel about made up attacks & lies. \n— The Media Lies (@MeganSmiles) February 3, 2017 \nWith literally tens of thousands of responses to Clinton’s tweet, there were a plethora of hilarious and highly snarky replies, but you get the general idea. \nOne would think that the Clintons would still be keeping a low profile after the embarrassing shellacking they received in November, but alas, some people simply can’t resist the urge to poke their head up and fire off a tweet shot at someone from time to time. \nOh wait, isn’t that something the left constantly criticizes the president for doing? \nH/T Right Scoop \nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can see how social media treated Chelsea Clinton for firing off a tweet without thinking through the ramifications of what she wrote. What do you think of the way social media reminded Chelsea Clinton about her own mother's penchant to \"make up attacks\"? Scroll down to comment below!
