The Obama administration had already paid for the advertising. An HHS spokesperson told Demko that the Trump administration had decided to cancel the final installment, worth about $5 million, in order “to look for efficiencies where they exist.” \nThe timing is critical. The open enrollment period for 2017 ends next week, on Jan. 31, and traditionally, signups have surged in the final days before the deadline. \nThose late signups don’t merely boost the program’s enrollment numbers. They also help insurers to hold down premiums. \nThat’s because insurance depends on premiums from healthy people to underwrite the medical bills of the small minority with serious health problems. And people in relatively good health are precisely the types to postpone enrolling until the very last minute. \nEnrollments have spiked in the final days of every sign-up period, and young people have been a big chunk of the late enrollees—last year they were 37 percent of the people signing up in the last week. \nIt's actually possible that Trump didn't do this entirely out of spite. \nRepublicans have been desperate to find a way to blame President Obama for the destruction of Obamacare they're about to create. That's part of what's behind House Speaker Paul Ryan's incessant lies that Obamacare is in a \"death spiral.\" It's not. It's actually pretty healthy right now. \nSo Republicans are sabotaging it. Trump signed the executive order last week telling the government to stop enforcing the individual mandate, taking away much of the incentive for this same group of healthy young people to sign up. Now they've axed the advertising telling people how much they can save in health insurance by using the exchange. If Republicans can keep this group from signing up, they can get their “death spiral” to impact the law. \nDon't let them. Share this ad with everyone you know between now and next Tuesday. Tell Trump \"fuck you\" in the most meaningful way possible. x", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T18:42:46.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
