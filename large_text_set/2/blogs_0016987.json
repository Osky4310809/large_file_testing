JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS . \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017 \nAfter touring the National Museum of African American Museum and Culture, Trump finally publicly condemned the threats of violence, saying, \nThis tour was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil. \nIt sure would be great if this simple denunciation of bigotry didn’t feel like a *big win* from the President of all people, but this is the world we’ve found ourselves in. \nStill, many, many people and groups are seeing this statement as too little, too late. Included in that group is the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, who gave us all a great reminder that we are under no obligation to give this man the benefit of any doubt he has already proven himself to barely (if at all) care about. \nThe organization posted a statement to their official Facebook page Tuesday morning and it is harsh. \nThe President’s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of Antisemitism that has infected his own Administration. His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Antisemitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration. \nHere’s the full post: \nMore threats to JCCs came yesterday, on Presidents’ Day, and as the Center points out, Trump said nothing. And– shocking , I know–the threats and Trump’s words in response have already been all but forgotten. Spicer declines to identify any specific action Pres. Trump is considering about anti-Semitic threats against Jewish centers. pic.twitter.com/zrMAdJ1glO \n— Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) February 21, 2017 \nThere’s nothing even close to unpatriotic about demanding so much more from the man ostensibly representing our country’s values than these vague regurgitated words about “bringing people together,” with no plan of action to protect the American people. \nWhen President Trump responds to Antisemitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that’s when we’ll be able to say this President has turned a corner. This is not that moment. \n(image via screengrab / ABC News ) \nWant more stories like this?
