That is why we do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company.\"\n\nThe statement was sent to Ford employees and emailed to Autoblog on Monday. The executives said they were unaware of any Ford workers affected by the travel ban , which suspends all refugees and also restricts entry into the United States from certain countries.\n\n\"We will continue working to ensure the well-being of our employees by promoting the values of respect and inclusion in the workplace,\" the Ford and Fields statement said.\n\nThe Trump administration said the executive order is needed to fortify national security. It triggered protests at airports around the country over the weekend and drew opposition from some government and international leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Auto Workers also came out against Trump's policy . In a statement, union chief Dennis Williams said: \"We must protect national security while remaining true to the very values that have made us a great nation. UAW opposes discrimination of any kind and denounces any policy that judges people based on their religion or nation of origin.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:09:40.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
