That’s the big difference for mine. \n“If anything, it probably actually cost us winning another flag with what potentially went on. \n“That’s probably what I have to say there. I know our football club did a lot of work post that 2006 era to work on our culture and make sure we became a much better club. \n“I think for the work that the club did, that’s the reason why they’re in the position that they’re in at the moment.” \nIn his Tuesday radio editorial, Bartlett slammed former Eagles coach — now Essendon coach — John Worsfold and West Coast chief executive Trevor Nisbett, saying “clearly judge Gillard felt they did not act strongly enough on compelling evidence”. Andrew Embley won the Norm Smith medal in 2006.

When people tell them something then it’s actually really hard to be able to act on stuff,” Embley said. \n“It was a difficult time for everyone and I know a lot of people were hurt through this. But all I can say is that from someone who was there throughout that time, I back our hierarchy in that they did everything they could with the evidence they had from the playing group.” \nEmbley’s premiership teammate Sam Butler, who’s still on the Eagles’ list, said Bartlett’s comments were “painful”. \n“I think we trained harder and wanted it more than any other team that year and that’s how I feel about that year when I look back on it,” Butler told TAB radio . \n“We have got players’ lives that have been hurt by it, but 99 per cent of the boys in that team are now fully-fledged members of society and are great people and always have been great people.” \nLIVE stream every game of every round of the 2017 Toyota AFL Premiership Season on FOX SPORTS.
