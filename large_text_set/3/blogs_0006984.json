With the German side advancing 4-1 on aggregate over Benfica, Pulisic’s goal turned out to be the one that sent Dortmund through to the Champions League quarterfinals. \nWATCH: Pulisic scores goal and adds assist \nStarting in place of the injured Marco Reus, Pulisic also contributed an assist on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s opener, and was involved in the build up to the side’s third goal. \nAnd the 18-year-old attacker, who has now scored six times in his Dortmund career, could not think of a bigger goal than his effort Wednesday. \n\"It was my first-ever Champions League goal and probably the most important one I've scored to date,” Pulisic told Dortmund’s website after the game. “It was an incredible, amazing feeling.\" \nPulisic had found himself on the bench in Dortmund’s past few contests, but seized his chance to shine when he netted in a 6-2 win over Bayer Leverkusen last weekend after replacing Reus. Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel heaped praise on the young attacker for battling through adversity. \n\"He’s a player who never gives up,” Tuchel said. “The good thing about him is he's open to criticism and always maintains his intensity. He and the team both put in an extraordinary second-half display today.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T04:36:07.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
