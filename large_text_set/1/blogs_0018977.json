On a lark, I decided to try out Astroneer , because it’s managed to remain among Steam’s top sellers for a month, which is no small feat. Turns out, it’s just the game I needed.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nAstroneer is the most fundamentally optimistic survival game I’ve ever played. It helped me feel good about humanity and the future, despite everything going on right now, if only briefly. It’s a game about constant awe and wonderment. From the get-go, it makes you feel like a flea lost in the overgrown, matted hair of a giant. I mean, this is the game’s opening:\n\nThe start screen is you, sealed like a pea in a tiny, helpless pod, overlooking a randomly generated behemoth. And then you launch. It’s immense. When you land, you’re greeted by patchwork plains of color and majestic twinkling in the distance. It’s like somebody dropped a planet into a pool of Elmer’s glue, construction paper, and glitter. You just want to look around and breathe the whole place in. Except you can’t, because there’s no air. \nAstroneer is about human perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds. Instead of conquering your environment, you must learn to understand it and live in harmony with it. If you don’t, you’ll die of suffocation—or a rock storm, which is not the name of an emerging power metal trio, but is instead a literal storm of rocks. \nAdvertisement \n\nI’ve been playing solo, which means there are only two characters in the game: me and the planet I’m on. When I started out, I was completely at the mercy of my environment. If I strayed from the general vicinity of my pod for more than a minute or so, I’d start suffocating. I was able to collect resources within a region the size of a rich person’s backyard. I could only wonder what lied off in the distance. \n\nAstroneer ’s early goings, especially, are about discovery—both in terms of understanding your environment and learning what you’re capable of. Each tiny step forward is a triumph. When I first figured out I could build tethers to create oxygen-rich pathways away from my base, I nearly whooped with glee. I’ll be honest: it took me an hour-and-a-half to figure out tethers were a crucial game mechanic. A tutorial would’ve been much quicker. But I got to figure it out!
