King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted a day ago 5 Kirk Hammett said that not contributing to the new Metallica album in terms of songwriting allowed him to fully focus on \"being the best lead guitar player I possibly could be.\"He tells Eddie Trunk : \"It's an unfortunate stream of events that led me to not contributing the way I wanted to. I accept that I just lost a bunch of music and the fact that this was one of the only Metallica albums I didn't contribute to. It gives me an unsettling feeling, but I'm at peace with it.\"The saving grace of all this is that the album is great! The album is great! Also, it enabled me to focus more on my lead guitar playing and trying to be the best lead guitar player I possibly could be.\"I really wanted to make sure I was specially effective in the other way I contribute to the band, which is my lead guitar playing.\"That offered me some sort of solace. But I'll tell you, I'm sitting on a lot of music now. And that pile keeps getting bigger - and I'm not putting it on my phone. [Chuckles]\"As reported, Kirk previously said he approached the solos by purposefully not practicing them at all .Explaining how he's quite pleased with the final outcome, the guitarist told Radio 21: \"I purposely did not prepare at all. I prepared maybe this much [shows not a whole lot of much with fingers], maybe 5%. But for most of everything, the idea was to go in there, be as spontaneous as possible, improvise as much as possible, and capture a real musical moment of time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T02:28:49.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
