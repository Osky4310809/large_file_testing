We’re talkin’ bout playoffs? You kidding me? Playoffs?” \nBut after the 76ers’ third win in four games on Sunday, Joel “The Process” Embiid is indeed talking about the playoffs. \n“I think we improved a lot,” Embiid said his team’s 105-95 win over the Nets . “You know, we’ve been playing great basketball. We’ve been winning games. I don’t know, we’re like seven or eight games out of the playoffs, so we have a chance. We’re learning. We’re growing together, learning how to play with each other.
