During the show, the mother of three explained to the host that his book, I Am A Pole (And So Can You!) , actually ended up getting her 13-year-old son, Joaquin, in trouble when he brought it to school to be read aloud by his teacher. The book, which is about a pole trying to find its purpose, actually features a scene at a strip club. Not only did the teacher quickly send it back with her son, but Kelly even got a personal note about how inappropriate it was. Watch her recount the hilarious moment above.
