Romero reacted to the news by saying, “Clearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country. Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.”\nSince Trump ordered the ban, celebrities have been slamming him for this ban.\nCelebrities like Sia , Zach Braff , and Rosie O’Donnell are now donating to the ACLU in order to help them fight the Muslim ban.\nhelp our queer & immigrant friends. send me your donation receipts for the @aclu & I will match up to $100K https://t.co/P9zVRH0WH0 #RESIST \n— sia (@Sia) January 28, 2017 \n\nClick inside to read more tweets… \nand i will match your 100K donation sia – #resist https://t.co/xkjVGeMWuR \n— ROSIE (@Rosie) January 29, 2017 \nPROTEST HAS PURPOSE!
