However, last week the South Korean company promised to do its best to release the official version of Android 7.1.1 for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge this month. It’s possible that the Galaxy S7 Active will receive it shortly after. \nFor a comprehensive overview of what the Nougat upgrade brings to Galaxy-branded smartphones, be sure to check out our 15-part What’s New with Nougat series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T14:49:33.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
