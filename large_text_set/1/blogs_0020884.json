Adam Lallana needs to be playing in midfield, as the most advanced of the three, on that left-hand side. You think back to when we were putting four, five and six past teams, and he was in that central midfield role. \n\"We had him, Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane in some brilliant form. We need to replicate that but there's just one problem – and he's over playing in the Africa Cup of Nations. \n\"With no Mane, it's an issue. Divock Origi's confidence is so low and he's playing so poorly, it's ridiculous. Can Daniel Sturridge play there? We just don't know. He popped up there against Swansea but he was coming too deep. \n\"In fairness to Jurgen, maybe he thought he had players to cope with his absence in Origi and Sturridge. They're both quick, direct and have proven themselves in this league, so it wasn't a stretch thinking they could. \n\"But for them two in particular right now, it's just not happening. You can't say they haven't had plenty of opportunities between them, but for whatever reason, it's not working out. View gallery \n\"Daniel has played right side for both Bolton and Chelsea, so why not us? Luis Suarez used to play out there, and no matter where Sturridge is on the pitch, he should be the one who makes it work for us. \n\"Fair enough, the pace that he had before his injury is lacking that extra half a yard, but his ability is obvious. The same goes for Origi, but it just isn't working for him right now, he hasn't been the same player since his injury in last season's Merseyside derby. \n\"Then you look at what's in reserve. Harry Wilson and Sheyi Ojo both featured against Plymouth, but here's one for you – what about Trent Alexander-Arnold? \n\"The lad is quick, has played in midfield at youth level and we need someone there with pace to stretch teams like Mane does. We aren't gifted with natural pace in the side and that's what is costing us. \n\"It's not ideal, but why not throw Trent in there until Mane comes back?\" poll loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T01:27:20.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
