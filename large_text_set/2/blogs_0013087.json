Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) by six points in a hypothetical 2020 presidential election. Forty-two percent of likely voters said they would support President Trump compared to 36 percent who would back Warren.\nThe poll's results were taken from a survey conducted on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10â€“mere days after Warren was \"silenced\" and reprimanded on the Senate floor for breaking one of the chamber's rules by attacking a colleague's character.\nWarren has been widely touted as a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2020 and is considered one of the more progressive members of the Senate. She was also a supporter of former President Barack Obama and has been a vocal critic of Trump since he took office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:43:33.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
