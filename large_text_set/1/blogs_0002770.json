West, his wife Kim Kardashian , and their two children, North and Saint, were all reportedly returning from visiting the gravesite of Kanye’s late mother, Donda West . \nAccording to a TMZ report, Dr. West, who passed in 2007, is buried in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The outlet says that this visit was the first time West has taken his entire family to the grave. \nWest’s closeness with his mother has been well documented via past songs, including his “ Only One ” single. Naming his creative content company DONDA and establishing the Donda’s House nonprofit organization further solidified that bond. \nSince being released from his recent hospital stay, West has been making more public appearances .
