INQUIRER FILE PHOTO / NINO JESUS ORBETA \nFormer representative and Bayan Muna chairman Neri Colmenares on Thursday criticized Social Security System (SSS) President Emmanuel Dooc for insisting on a contribution increase, saying that it has “no ground.” \n“SSS has no ground to increase contributions when they have not even undertaken reforms to increase collection, increase investment efficiency and other reform measures,” Colmenares said in a statement. \nColmenares, who was the principal author of the SSS pension increase in Congress, cited that the Section 18 of RA 8282 or the SSS law requires presidential approval for any increase in contribution. ADVERTISEMENT \n“Nowhere in the SSS Board Resolution and even in the Malacañang order approving pension increase can one find an approval of contribution increase and yet, SSS Pres. Dooc keeps on harping that it shall be imposed this May,” he added. READ: Palace orders increase in SSS pension \nHe recalled that during congressional hearings on the bill, SSS has agreed that increase in collection will increase SSS fund life. Colmenares noted that if SSS will first implement reforms for a year or two, the agency will find out that with increased collection, they may not even need to increase contribution. \n“At the very least, the increased contribution will be much less than their projected increase. Trabaho muna, huwag trabahong tamad (They should work first, not lazy work),” the former congressman said. \nColmenares also cited that for every 10% increase in collection rate efficiency, about 4 to 5 years are added to SSS actuarial life. One study, he said, showed that if SSS will only increase its collection rate efficiency from a dismal 40% to more than 60%, they may not even need a contribution increase. \n“So why ask for contribution increase when SSS has not even calculated its collection rate efficiency?” Colmenares said. \nHe urged Malacañang not to approve the contribution increase, now that wages cannot keep up with surging prices of goods and to allow senior citizens and SSS members to “savor the blessings of the recent pension increase.” \nHe asked President Rodrigo Duterte to demand quality work from the agency before allowing the said increase as well. \n“Alam naming matrabaho ang mag habol sa collection at mga employer. Mas madali ang trabaho ng SSS pag taasan na lang ang contribution (We know that going after the collection and employers is tedious. The work of SSS would be easier if they would increase the contribution). But they have a mandate to work and not merely sit in Board meetings,” Colmenares said. \n“We will support SSS efforts to go after employers who do not remit workers contribution to SSS. The problem is, pag tinaasan mo ang contribution, sigurado mag tatamad tamaran na naman ang SSS sa paghabol ng koleksyon (when you hike the contribution, the SSS will certainly become lazy in going after the collection),” he added.
