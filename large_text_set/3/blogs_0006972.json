As an American, I cannot imagine anyone born anywhere who would not covet living in this most wonderful nation on earth. How much more must that be true for religious minorities crushed by dictators, Syrians fleeing a man-made hell into which President Obama avoided dipping a crisp cuff, and the poor of a hundred nations who eat in a month what we throw out in a week.   Obama’s Immigration, Refugee And Asylum Policies Placed America At Great Risk \nBut it is not Trump’s fault that those who have been waiting forever for freedom must wait a little longer. Necessity calls him to act with urgency — necessity created by the incompetence of the Obama administration, which allowed the problem to grow until it could only be tackled by a man with the grim determination of Trump to do whatever is necessary regardless of the media frenzy. \nFor eight years, the Obama administration oversaw a system it knew was broken, but let the time bomb tick, while putting the public mask of compassion on a policy that was nothing more than pure political calculation. \nThere is no question the Obama administration was happy to dilute the American melting pot to become something less American and more globalist. Obama himself has declaimed about the need for more liberals, and who better to support a liberal government than citizens who owed their entry — legally or illegally — to the Democratic Party?   \nAs for security, Obama’s policy was very clear: When things went wrong, it was never the terrorists and always the guns that should be banned. \nThen reality grew too big for the American people to ignore. \nThe Obama World Order, in which everyone sat around a table, sang songs and ate marshmallows, was finally exposed as a fraud. ISIS grew. Terror spread. Fear spread faster. Europe — where Western culture is now drowning in a sea of migrant-fueled devastation and destruction — showed the impact of the full vision Obama and other liberals wanted for this nation. \nAmericans finally realized that immigration policy has been a disaster waiting to happen. The message of San Bernardino, Orlando, and all the rest, is that among the thousands who come here with dreams not unlike our ancestors, others come to kill, to sow hate and to destroy.   Gowdy: Evidence So Far Lacking To Support Trump’s Wiretap Claim \nAnd, above all, the government has no idea which are which. \nI do not like Trump’s policy, as necessary as it is. It is not the stuff of celebrations. It is a hard policy in a world of hard choices. However, few things he does are more essential. The insanity of believing the myth propagated by liberals that all people coming to this nation must be good because we wish it so has blinded Americans to the extent of our vulnerability. \nIt only take a handful to kill thousands. \nAs does Trump, I want this nation to be the light of the world, the second chance for those slaughtered in the name of religion or starved for being the wrong tribe. Yet to willfully blind ourselves to the truth of the danger we face would be akin to knowing Pearl Harbor is coming and deliberately failing to act. \nTrump is doing what must be done. In a world that hates America, hates Christians, hates freedom and will do anything to sow death, Americans must learn that we are at war, a war that is likely to last as long as the Cold War, but with far greater danger. \nTrump’s executive order is a piece of grim resolve. It is the mark of his commitment to leadership that he has the guts to do what must be done knowing that it will not be popular. He deserves the salute of every American for taking up a burden any other politician would refuse to face, and that his predecessor knowingly made worse. \nThe Statue of Liberty is often invoked when discussing Trump’s order; the ships she must have seen as they entered New York Harbor. \nFor me, for Trump, and for millions of others, there is an enduring scarring memory of another sight her eyes once beheld — of twin towers bleeding smoke as the world became clouds of ash smothering echoes of screams. \nNever again. No matter what. Never. \nIf many who deserve to live their dreams here must wait, so be it, so that on that day when they can begin their lives here, the America that greets them will be a safer, more secure nation where those who would bring death and destruction are barred at the gate. \nTrump is doing what must be done. Yes, it may be cruel. But for the sake of this nation, for the innocent lives that must not be lost, it is truly necessity. \nRusty Davis is a freelance writer.
