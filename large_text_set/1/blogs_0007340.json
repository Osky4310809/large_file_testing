Yes, the phone was able to occupy the top spot for nine months straight, including December. And while demonetisation did affect the smartphone industry , it didn’t slow down the pace of phone launches. So now it’s time to see which of the launches from last month garnered consumer attention to rank among the most popular 20 phones. As always, this list is based on the number of user searches for the smartphones, and doesn’t necessarily indicate their sales. The top 5 \nAs mentioned above, the Redmi Note 3 ( review ) remains at first place. However, it’s the second device that took us by surprise. Lenovo’s K series has always been a blockbuster, and the latest in the range, the K6 Note, also seems to be continuing in the same vein. Meanwhile, Xiaomi’s budget Redmi 3s Prime ( review ) leapt five spots to reach the third position. The selfie phenomenon has taken over the world, and that’s apparent as the world’s first phone with a 20MP front camera – the vivo V5 ( review ) – is at the fourth seating. The Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ( first impressions ) has managed to jump two places to sit at fifth position. The complete list \nThe devices have risen in popularity not just in the top 5, but in the entire list of top 20 phones too. Without further ado, let’s take a look at the smartphones, along with the change in their ranking in comparison to November, their price segment, and the month of launch in India. Hits and misses Lenovo K6 Note: 2nd position \nAs mentioned above, Lenovo has been quite successful with its K series, and the latest in the range, the K6 Note doesn’t seem any different. With a 5.5-inch full HD display, the K6 Note comes powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, up to 4GB of RAM, and a massive 4,000mAh battery. But the highlight of the smartphone is that it’s available to buy from offline retail stores as well. Xiaomi Redmi 3S: 13th position \nFollowing the footsteps of the Redmi Note 3 siblings, the compact Redmi 3S gives company to its costlier variant, the Redmi 3S Prime. Priced at Rs 6,999, the Redmi 3S offers quite a lot – a 5-inch 720p display, SD430 chipset, 2GB RAM, and most importantly, a powerful 4,000mAh battery. Micromax Canvas Juice 4G: 17th position \nThe Micromax Canvas Juice seems to be playing hide and seek with our list. It finds its place one month, and is ousted the next. That said, it certainly manages to hold its own among the A-listers owing to its decent set of specs, along with a capacious battery of 4,000mAh. Moto M: 18th position \nThe latest offering from Lenovo in its Moto series has become quite popular as soon as it got launched. The first all-metal Moto brings to the table a 5.5-inch full HD IPS display, MediaTek Helio P15 octa-core chipset, and choice between 3 or 4GB of RAM.
