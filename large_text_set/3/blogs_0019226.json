Verratti joined PSG in 2012 and has won four Ligue 1 titles \n\"It's a complicated situation, because he has a good contract there,\" Di Campli told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"But he wants to win things and PSG, in the state they're in now, cannot win things. \n\"He's been in Paris for five years and now has to ask himself some big questions: should he carry on earning a lot without winning, or leave to become a champion? The Italian international has been linked with a move away from PSG \n\"It's not a question of money - anyone who would take Verratti would pay him a lot - and one thing is sure... if he leaves PSG, it will be for a top European club.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T14:01:18.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
