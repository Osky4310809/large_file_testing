Ivanovic left Chelsea in the January transfer window after nine seasons (Photo: Ian Walton) \n\"Training was unique under Mourinho,\" he told Sport Express . \"He sometimes plays mind games with the press, but when it comes to the most important things, the matches themselves, he is always very serious. If you want to play for Mourinho, you have to follow his demands. \n\"Mourinho helps to develop the best qualities -- professional and personal. You can't be indifferent to him. You either love him or hate him. That's what makes him special. I am glad that I had a chance to work with him. Ivanovic says you either love or hate Mourinho (Photo: Clive Mason) \n\"Ancelotti is very different. If players had a choice, I guess they would prefer to spend the entire career with Carlo. He is very calm and takes all the negative aspects on him, allowing the players to be comfortable. The results are equally good with both coaches.\" \nIvanovic made only seven appearances at Chelsea this season and is looking forward to testing himself at Zenit. \n\"I asked [the club] to release me if I received a suitable offer,\" he added. \"Chelsea agreed, and I am very happy with that. \n\"There was an option to go to China, but I want to play at a decent level and continue my development. That's why I chose Zenit.\" poll loading Who would you rather play under? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T18:41:51.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
