The season of Lent is one when Christians talk about dying to ourselves. \n\"But the message from the grave is one of hope - hope for those who are struggling with addictions, hope for those who feel life is hopeless, and hope of life that is eternal. John hopes his exploits will raise awareness of mental health and addiction (Photo: Alan Lewis) \n\"John knows that he is going to be buried on March 1. The rest of us don't know when we will be buried, when our lives will end - but for every Christian there is the confident hope of life forever because of what Jesus has won for us on the cross. \n\"He did it so that we don't have to pay the price for our sin and guilt. John Edwards demonstrates the amazing transformation that Jesus can bring to our lives. I invite you to join in the live streaming of this event and hear for yourself.\" \nJohn's explots can be followed on social media using the hashtag #GraveChat.
