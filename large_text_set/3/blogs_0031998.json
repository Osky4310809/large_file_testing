International breaks are the worst. First, we have a tweet from the Belgium national football team saying that Thibaut Courtois will miss their match against Russia on Tuesday due to some sort of a hip injury. UPDATE | Marouane @Fellaini Fellaini (toe), @ThibautCourtois (hip) and @LaurentCiman23 (knee) will also not play against @TeamRussia #BelRus — BelgianRedDevils (@BelRedDevils) March 26, 2017 The move sounds largely precautionary, as according to HLN journalist Kristof Terreur, it’s just a “minor hip problem” and the goalkeeper will be available for next weekend’s Chelsea match against Crystal Palace. Thibaut Courtois won't play against Russia due to a minor hip problem. Expected to be fit against Crystal Palace, though. #cfc pic.twitter.com/oOV1wTDodR — Kristof Terreur (@HLNinEngeland) March 26, 2017 Slightly more concerning is Diego Costa’s ankle, which he injured in training with the Spain national football team on Tuesday. OFFICIAL | Diego Costa gets the ok after undergoing x-ray to check extent of injury https://t.co/1qDjLW2EQV — Selección Española (@SeFutbol) March 26, 2017 While the tests came back with no significant damage to the striker’s “foot and ankle”, just the fact that he had to go get scans on them is concerning. Costa has apparently remained with the team after they informed Chelsea of the player’s situations. Still, hopefully he’s not forced into action on Tuesday in the friendly against France. International breaks are the worst.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:44:37.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
