Rich Fury/Rich Fury/Invision/AP Jordan Peele will receive the CinemaCon Director of the Year award for his work on his directorial debut, the box office hit \"Get Out.\" (Photo by Rich Fury/Invision/AP) \nPosted: 4:20 p.m. Wednesday, March 29, 2017 \nJordan Peele, writer and director of the brilliant socially conscious horror film “Get Out,” is being honored as Director of the Year at CinemaCon, the gathering of the National Association of Theatre Owners, happening March 30 in Las Vegas. \n>> Read more trending news \n“With the phenomenon known as ‘Get Out,’ Jordan Peele has instantaneously become a force to reckon with as a gifted and enormously talented director and filmmaker,” CinemaCon Managing Director Mitch Neuhauser said in a statement . “He has audiences and critics around the globe enamored and spellbound, dare I say hypnotized, with his wildly inventive directorial debut, and we are ecstatic to be honoring him as this year’s ‘Director of the Year.’” \nRelated: Jordan Peele's directorial debut 'Get Out' makes impressive box office gross \n“Get Out,” his directorial debut, is quite a departure from “Keanu” or the acclaimed Comedy Central sketch comedy series “Key and Peele.” The movie starts out hitting the notes of a romantic comedy, with Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, who is black, and Rose, played by Allison Williams, who is white, headed to a weekend at her parents’ home outside of New York and in the countryside. \nRelated: Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” takes on the horrors of racism \n“I wrote this movie in the Obama presidency. It felt like race was not being discussed in a way I felt like it deserved to be,” Peele said during an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . “For the past couple of years and especially now, racial tension and racial conversation is front and center in this country.” \nThe movie captivated audiences and made history when Peele became the first African-American writer-director to earn $100 million with his debut movie. Yet he knows all too well the persistent sting of racism. \n“I’ve been asked to hang up coats” while attending black-tie events, he said. \n“We have to look within ourselves constantly,” Peele said. “Racism is always going to be present in this country, and racism is not a one-sided dynamic. This isn’t just a black horror movie, this is a movie everyone is meant to enjoy. It’s a way to promote that conversation in a way that’s fun.” Sign up for Newsletters Want more news?
