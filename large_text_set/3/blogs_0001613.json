We can only assume that they’ll be sold for around the same price as the originals, $10. Seems pretty reasonable for such powerful wipes!\nAnd while we’re speculating, what could those beautiful products on her arm be?! They’ve gotta be liquid lipsticks, don’t you think? They could also be the new Studded Kiss formula, though, which would be very exciting as well!
