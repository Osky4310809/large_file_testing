Turns out they’re sisters. (nbcnewyork.com) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, March 25, 2017, 3:56 PM \nThey knew they were sisters in blue — then they found out they were sisters by blood. \nTwo NYPD rookies assigned to the same Bronx stationhouse used to laugh off the fact that they both have the same last name — then they learned they were half sisters, officials said. \nThe two learned about the connection after they started talking about family members — and learned they had the same father, Hector Molina. \n\"When she told me his name — which is the exact same as mine — I stood speechless,\" Police Officer Jasmine Molina told NBC New York about her half-sister Yadarquiris Molina. \"I didn't have anything to say.\" \nPlaying a cop helps Jennifer Lopez appreciate the NYPD \nThe story was first reported by Telemundo. \nIn January 2014, Yadarquiris, the older sister, was assigned to the Bronx’s 42nd Precinct in Morrisania straight out of the police academy, officials said. At about the same time, Jasmine, who had joined the force in 2012, was transferred to the 42nd Precinct from the nearby 41st Precinct. \nThe two had lockers right next to each other and would often joke about their daily assignments getting accidentally switched because they had the same last name. \nThen Yadarquiris remembered something her mother had told her — that, somewhere out there, she had a sister. \nNYPD cop helps with difficult delivery of baby on the BQE \nAs the two cops grew closer, Yadarquiris started asking about Jasmine’s family and the connection was discovered, she told Fox News. \n“One day she said ‘It would be funny if we were family’ and we started laughing,” Jasmine told Fox News. “I said ‘Maybe, because I don’t know my father’s side of the family.’” \nTheir father passed away a few years ago, said Yadarquiris, who believes that some divine intervention had a hand in the siblings’ reunion. \n“I feel at peace because we found each other,” said Yadarquiris.
