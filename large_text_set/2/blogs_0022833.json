About 500 Brinker employees will be making the move next year. \nThe 216,300-square-foot office building will be part of developer Billingsley Co.'s Sound project, which includes apartments, retail, restaurant and corporate office space. \n\"What worked for us at Cypress Waters was the custom-build option that allows us to create our own space,\" Brinker CEO Wyman Roberts said. \n\"The primary thing was to be able to create a space that works for our people. Having that lake visibility and the creating of all of the green space we think is a real plus.\" \nThe four-story building on Olympus Boulevard is in the same area where Billingsley Co. is building a lakeside park, shopping center and hundreds of apartments. It will be in the northwest Dallas portion of the project. \n\"We love the location and access to that lake,\" Roberts said. \"It's not your typical corporate spot.\" \nThe surrounding Cypress Waters development is already home to corporations including 7-Eleven, CoreLogic, OneSource, Toyota Finance, Nationstar Mortgage and BT Americas. \nBrinker International has been in a low-rise complex at the southeast corner of LBJ Freeway and Hillcrest Road. The company, which owns Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants, has been in the North Dallas buildings since the 1980s. \n\"Where we are at today, we have a nice little campus,\" Roberts said. \"These buildings — we love our space — but they need so much work to get them to function competitively and work as hard as what a new space can do for us.\" \nRoberts said Brinker also is not using all of the existing buildings. \nThe Cypress Waters campus, designed by Dallas architect HKS, will open in late 2018. Jeweler Signet/Zales is locating an office in the same area as Brinker's planned building. \n\"The Sound will serve as the town center for Cypress Waters,\" said Lucy Burns, Partner at Billingsley Co. \"When we were planning the area, we knew the unique nature of having so many amenities right on the water's edge was going to be appealing to many companies, so having a global brand with a rich Dallas history like Brinker is a perfect fit.\" \nBrinker International looked at a handful of final office options before picking Cypress Waters. Commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield worked with the restaurant company to evaluate office options. \n\"It's been about an 18-month process,\" said Rick Hughes, Cushman & Wakefield's executive managing director. \"We looked at all options between the High Five and North Central Expressway and D/FW Airport. \n\"From the very onset, they wanted something new and fresh,\" said Hughes, who worked on the deal with Cushman & Wakefield's Maureen Kelly Cooper and Robbie Baty. \"They have been in their facility 30-plus years. \n\"They wanted a new shiny penny and to develop a headquarters around their business.\" \nThe new offices will include test kitchens and dining facilities to test and showcase restaurant menu options. \nHughes said the real estate firm did traffic and community studies for potential locations. \n\"With all the development throughout the Metroplex, we were trying to determine what the drive is going to be in a few years,\" Roberts said. \"It's difficult because of all the growth and the length of the commutes.\" The Billingsley Co. will build Brinker International's new headquarters at Cypress Waters.
