Hungarian official Viktor Kassai awarded a penalty to the Japanese side after consulting using technology. \nThe next day it was consulted again for a Cristiano Ronaldo goal that looked offside. \nAnd just last month David Villa was sent off for New York City after being caught on camera punching Houston Dynamo's AJ DeLaGarza. The referee had booked Villa but after consulting the replays, sent the former Barcelona man off.

If that stops six players from each team going to talk the referee, that will enhance respect and improve respect for the game.” poll loading Is it time for video technology in football? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T00:55:39.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
