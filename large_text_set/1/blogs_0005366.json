Valencia bundles in from close range (Photo: PA Wire) \nIt was one of the few bright periods of a tense game. First Fraser Forster saved Romelu Lukaku's header brilliantly, but was unlucky to see it flick off the big Everton striker and fall to the West Ham striker, who bundled the ball home. \nThen Maya Yoshida came through the back of Valencia on the edge of the box as the striker controlled, and Leighton Baines converted in style.

Saints miss Van Dijk Everton's Kevin Mirallas shoots at goal (Photo: REUTERS) \nSouthampton are solid but unremarkable this season, which is no wonder, given they almost automatically lose their best players, once they show any form. \nVan Dijk was missing here, and in the end, they paid the price for his absence. 2. Rodriguez back in form Jay Rodriguez is pulled back by Tom Davies (Photo: Clive Brunskill) \nIt's beginning to look a lot like Rodriguez. \nJay has suffered incredible torment with injuries after so many struggles with injury. \nIt has taken him six months, but his old instinct is back, and 2017 could see him return to the England fold. 3. Davies shines for Toffees Davies lays on the floor after being fouled (Photo: PA Wire) \nEverton's kids have promise, but the Premier League is a tough crowd to break. \nTom Davies looks energetic and neat in the middle, but in these days when the money is available to buy quality, the competition is hot. 4. Williams getting back to his best Ashley Williams warms up (Photo: REUTERS) \nAshley Williams is a fine buy for the Blues, even if his best years are probably behind him. \nHe changes partner virtually every week, and had to nurse the struggling Funes Mori here, but his is a leader and that is important. 5. Festive period takes its toll Idrissa Gueye in action with Southampton's Oriol Romeu (Photo: REUTERS) \nIs it any wonder teams look listless in the New Year, after a programme of so many games over the festive period. \nYes, they did it in the past, but they didn't run 15km a game back then, or have the athleticism of today. It needs changing. Player ratings \nJoel 6 - Little to do in first half, and made important save late on \nColeman 7 - Usual amount of energy, and impressively kept it going \nWilliams 7 - Led by example with strong showing at heart of defence \nFunes Mori 6 - Given trouble by Rodriguez but battled to stick to task \nBaines 7 - So consistent and also showed great urgency going forward \nGueye 7 - Last game for a while, and didn't disappoint with commitment \nDavies 6 - Looked at home in hurly burly of Premier League, one to watch \nCalvert-Lewin 5 - Sadly, didn't have time to make mark after early injury \nBarkley 7 - MOTM. Again showed signs that his struggles are not so difficult \nLennon 6 - Did great job covering running back, less influence up front \nLukaku 6 - His laconic appearance causes frustration amongst the fans \nSubs: Mirallas 6 (Calvert-Lewin 12), Valencia 6 (Lennon 62), Barry 6 (Barkley 85) Everton's goalkeeper Joel Robles jumps to make a save (Photo: Getty Images) Seamus Coleman attempts to take the ball past James Ward-Prowse (Photo: Clive Brunskill) Southampton \nForster 6 - Not troubled much in sterile game, unlucky to be beaten twice \nCedric 5 - Unlucky to bash head in hoarding, and carried off early \nFonte 7 - Led by example with intelligent display at the back \nYoshida 6 - Difficult job deputising van Dijk, but solid enough in defence \nMcQueen 6 - Big powerful lad who looks like will develop into real talent \nWard-Prowse 6 - Tidy display in the heart of midfield, needs to kick on now \nRomeu 6 - Hard work and unflashy in the middle in dour central battle \nClasie 6 - Little man with big heart, also has ability to control game's pace \nRedmond 6 - One outstanding chance in first half, but headed wide \nRodriguez 7 - Looks like he is slowly coming back to top pre-injury levels \nTadic 6 - Saw so little of ball but on rare occasions had flashes of quality \nSubs: Stephens 6 (Cedric 6), Boufal 6 (Tadic 67), Long 6 (Clasie 78) poll loading Will Everton qualify for Europe this season? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T19:25:12.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
