On Sunday, a U.S. appeals court denied a request from the Department of Justice to restore Trump's order. \nScott criticized the temporary ban for the lack of proper explanation, and for not giving people time to prepare for it, at least two weeks or so in advance. \n\"I think it was mean spirited, I think it represents a rising tide of nationalism that is at odds with the Gospel,\" the pastor said. \nSpeaking about the Christian responsibility when it comes to refugees, he argued it should always be one of \"openness and kindness.\" \nScott said that in both the Old and New Testaments, Christian faith \"as such does not recognize national boundaries.\" \n\"It is a nation without boundaries, it is an international nation itself. A kingdom. All Christian are dual citizens: where they reside, and the Kingdom of God,\" he continued. \n\"As citizens of the Kingdom of God, we ought to see all human beings as created in the image and the likeness of God. As Christians, we believe that Christ died for all, and we are to give witness to all, and kindness and consideration to all. We risk harm to ourselves in order to show care to others.\" \nAnother controvery arose when Trump suggested in an interview with CBN News last month that his administration would prioritize Christians and other religious minorities seeking asylum in the U.S. However, such language about prioritization does not appear in the executive order. \nSome megachurch pastors, such as Pastor Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, have strongly backed Trump's attempts at a temporary ban and the suggestion to prioritize Christians. \n\"Nine out of the top 10 nations persecuting Christians are Muslim majority nations, which is why President Trump is absolutely correct in giving preference to Syrian refugees who are Christians,\" Jeffress said in an interview last week. \nPersecution watchdog groups, such as Open Doors USA, have expressed mixed views on Trump's comments, backing him for recognizing the severity of Christian persecution, but also questioning whether the prioritization of Christians would actually be the right move. \n\"Expediting refugee entry for those intentionally targeted by ISIS, like the Yazidis and Christians and some Muslim groups, seems appropriate. However, cherry-picking one religion over another only exacerbates the already severe worldwide trend of religious persecution,\" David Curry, president of Open Doors USA, said in a statement. \nFree sign up cp newsletter!
