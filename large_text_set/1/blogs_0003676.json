Miranda Kerr’s recent bridesmaid dress is actually our dream summer wedding gown. Kerr wore the ivory crocheted lace ensemble to her brother’s Australian wedding and looked like a vintage fairy princess .\nKeeping the look light and ethereal, Kerr and her fellow bridesmaids paired their white dresses with peach-toned flower crowns and nude heels. Mother to the Kerr siblings, Terese Kerr, shared photos of the wedding party on Instagram.\nNow we for sure believe in love at first sight because Kerr’s dress is making our heart ache in the best way.

But wedding or no wedding, these white lace frocks are perfect for any fancy warm weather occasion.\nThe “Vow Do You Do?” dress from ModCloth ,$99.99. ModCloth We love this dress because of its high neckline and open lace sleeves. More similar to the dresses of the other members of the Kerr wedding party, this dress gives off a ’60s vibe and would look beautiful paired with a colorful flower crown.\nThe “Cordially Delighted” dress from ModCloth , $150. ModCloth With a vintage 1950s flare, this dress also offers a high neckline with collar detail. Peek-a-boo lace adorns the cap sleeves and the hemline giving the dress an airy feel while still staying modest.

The model is even wearing a flower crown similar to that of Kerr’s.\nThis Dreamersandlovers short bell-sleeved lace dress is also crazy awesome. For $520, you’re getting a handmade wedding dress!
