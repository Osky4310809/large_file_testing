Visitors from North America, Europe and the Middle East represented more than a quarter of the total number of arrivals from January to December 2016, according to a ForwardKeys study published in January. \nAmong the top destinations in Iran is Persepolis, the 2,500-year-old heritage site, once considered to be the capital of the Persian empire. Located north of the city of Shiraz, Persepolis, also known as Takht-e-Jamshid (Throne of Jamshid), has been in ruins since Alexander the Great raided it in 333 BC. \nWhat is left of the ancient city has become an attraction for local and foreign visitors alike, particularly after it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979. At the Gate of Xerxes, two massive winged bulls with human heads, also known as Lamassu, stand at the eastern doorway. \nIn recent years, agricultural activities have caused the soil around Persepolis to collapse owing to the depletion of groundwater and drought. Growth of algae and bacteria in the ruins have also threatened the many archaeological objects at the site, which was carved on the side of the Rahmet Mountain. \nBut with the reopening of the country, experts from Japan and Italy are lending their hands to preserve the site for the many visitors expected in the years to come. \nPersepolis is a 2,500-year-old heritage site, once considered to be the capital of the Persian Empire. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nDarius the Great, the king of the Achaemenid Empire, started to build the city in 518 BC, carving it on the side of the Rahmet Mountain. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nIn 1971, Persepolis became the main staging ground of the 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire, hosted by the Pahlavi Dynasty. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nPersepolis, also known as Takht-e-Jamshid (Throne of Jamshid), was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nOne of the most imposing parts of Persepolis are the Lamassus, the massive winged bulls with human heads, that stand on the eastern doorway of the Gate of Xerxes. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nAfter the ousting of the Shah of Iran, Persepolis continued to be protected, despite Ayatollah Khomeini's criticism of the lavish celebration in 1971. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nPersepolis is also one of the most popular destinations among local tourists, especially during Nowruz, the Persian New Year. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nAround 333 BC, the site was laid to ruins after the invasion of Alexander the Great. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nPersepolis is located 60km northeast of the city of Shiraz and its international airport, making it accessible to international tourists. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nAccording to a recent study, Iran reported 18 percent growth in international arrivals in 2016. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nVisitors from North America, Europe and the Middle East represented a substantial portion of tourist arrivals in 2016. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nAccording to a recent report, depletion of groundwater has caused land subsidence of as much as 600 metres, threatening the ancient site. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nIn April 2016, Air France resumed its Paris-Tehran flights after eight years, opening up a new tourism market to the country. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nExperts from Japan and Italy are lending their hands to protect the site from climate-induced destruction and human activities. [Mohammad Ali Najib/Al Jazeera] \nPersepolis still faces the possibility of losing its world heritage status if efforts to restore the site fail.
