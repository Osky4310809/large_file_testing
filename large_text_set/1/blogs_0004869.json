(real name Saruhan Saral) He started this back in 2015, and it took around 3 months to bring it to completion. The trailer stars some of Marvel and DC's finest, courtesy of their more recent video game incarnations. Spidey's model looks to be from the Amazing Spider-Man while Batman seems to come from the Arkham series. Heroes like Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern are all pulled from Injustice , and Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America are all pulled from their various individual titles. It's also a nice touch that their voices are carried over from the films. \nThe visuals were completed using Blender and Adobe After Effects, with Audacity being used for the sound effects and soundtrack. All in all, it's pretty impressive, and you can view part one of the action epic in the video above. \nYou can head to Mightyraccoon's official YouTube page for more great work. \nIn Justice League , fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. Justice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, and features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Ciarán Hinds, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons and Jesse Eisenberg. \nDoctor Strange is in theaters now, and next up for Marvel is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on May 5, 2017. Spider-Man: Homecoming lands on July 7, 2017, followed by Thor: Ragnarok on November 3, 2017. After that Black Panther debuts on February 16, 2018, while Avengers: Infinity War hits theaters on May 4, 2018. Ant-Man and the Wasp is slated for July 6, 2018, followed by Captain Marvel on March 8, 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:18:34.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
