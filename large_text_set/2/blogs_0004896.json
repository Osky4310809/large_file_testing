Do we go the right way? Maybe. But if you look at society all over the world, we are not really sure.” \nWenger will be in with the Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge, albeit well heeled supporters in executive seats. His touchline ban means he can still give dressing room team talks but the directors’ box is over the side of the ground. \nThe Arsenal manager might get a friendlier reception from the Chelsea fans rather than his own supporters after the fall-out of Tuesday night. \nBut he is not immune to the feelings of the Arsenal fans and confirmed that he will decide on whether to stay or go this summer depending on the mood as much as anything else.

That is the only way you can guarantee the future. \n“We worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow is not in the summer. It is tomorrow. \nThe players must not think beyond the game.
