(ANI) \nThough Indian Army Kargil war martyr’s daughter Gurmehar Kaur has been receiving support from across the nation, relatives of other martyrs seem not to be too happy about her statements. In fact, they are expressing outrage at her for nullifying her father’s supreme sacrifice. Gurjeet, sister of martyr Gurnam Singh, who foiled a major infiltration bid and died during combat said the Delhi University student Gurmehar has “insulted her father’s martyrdom”. The 20-year old girl was surrounded by controversy soon after her social media post condemning violence at Delhi University’s Ramjas college was posted, in which she had shared a photo of herself holding a placard reading: “I am a student of delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every Student f India is with me.” Following that, some people unearthed Gurmehar’s last year’s pro-peace posts in which she said, “Pakistan did not kill my father. The war did.” However, Gurjeet told the news agency ANI that Gurmehar’s father “died in a war started by Pakistan.” \nYou may also like to watch: \nEarlier, in the day, Pooja, daughter of Pathankot martyr Lance Naik Moolraj requested Gurmehar Kaur not to make fun of her father’s martyrdom. The girl said “Main Gurmehar Kaur se kahoongi please apne pitaji ki shahadat ka mazak mat banaiye” (I would like to tell Gurmehar Kaur that please do not make fun of her father’s martyrdom). \nAnother martyr’s daughter jumps into row, takes Gurmehar Kaur to task over Pakistan comment \nMeanwhile, Gurmehar has pulled out her protest against the ABVP and left national capital for her hometown Jalandhar on Tuesday (February 28) to move away from the ongoing “turbulence”, as she was allegedly getting death and rape threats through social media platforms. She has also deleted her social media account on Friday. “It’s not just my campaign, it’s a students’ campaign, I just happened to start it, people who believe in it will take it forward and are taking it forward,” Gurmehar told FE Online.
