When you look at our world today you have to wonder how we got here.\nIt was in my later years of high school that I began to feel relief about something that bothered me for a long time: I started to realize how the world really works. Now at 29 years old, I’ve interviewed, met with and worked with many of the top researchers in the field of truth seeking and several conclusions are clear, but one more than others: our world is run by psychopaths.\nI want to be very clear here, this is not meant to be a judgment, to rile up our emotions and call these people evil, no. This is about coming to a stark realization about what’s really going on in our world so that we can actually change it.\n“As difficult as it was for me, I’ve come to an inescapable and profoundly disturbing conclusion. I believe that an elite group of people and the corporations they run have gained control over not just our energy, food supply, education, and healthcare, but over virtually every aspect of our lives; and they do it by controlling the world of finance. Not by creating more value, but by actually controlling the source of money.” – Foster Gamble \nWhy It’s Important You know it, you feel it. Something is not quite right with our world and as each day goes by, more and more people are realizing this in a big way. In 2016 we witnessed millions begin to realize how elections are rigged and that we truly have no choice.\nWe began to learn on a wider level that our world leaders are closely involved with companies who fund terror and that the war on terror is fabricated to justify certain actions.\nComing to understandings like this shows a shift in our overall consciousness as a planet and helps us to realize how we can move forward. Should we keep voting expecting to see change when that’s not how our world actually works? Should we spend money supporting companies who are harming us and our environment? Should we support the medical system blindly vs working to create better health and wellness so illness doesn’t happen?\nThe more we understand how the game works, the more we know how to change it. Think of it this way, imagine you are playing a game and you find out someone is cheating and rigging the rules so you can never win. You may get up and just walk away and say I’m not playing anymore. Since that person can’t play with no one, they just stop. In a sense this is exactly what we need to work towards.\nA transformation in consciousness comes from understanding, which leads to taking new actions, which helps to create a different world and bring solutions. But it starts with knowledge and consciousness.\nJohn Lennon Speaks Truth John Lennon’s is synonymous with peace and political activism. He was always a bit of a rebel, even early in life, and helped millions to think differently about their world. His song “Give Peace a Chance” is an anthem for the anti-war movement and is still heard today during peace marches around the world.\nBest known for his time with the Beatles, John has always had strong views about politics and today might be equally as known for his activism and wisdom.\n‘Imagine all the people living life in peace. You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. I hope someday you’ll join us, and the world will be as one. ‘\n‘You don’t need anybody to tell you who you are or what you are. You are what you are!’ \n‘My role in society, or any artist’s or poet’s role, is to try and express what we all feel. Not to tell people how to feel. Not as a preacher, not as a leader, but as a reflection of us all. ‘ \nLennon had a deep sense of wisdom about him and even to this day his words contain a power that can affect millions, which is why this piece is being written. With the upcoming elections gaining great attention, I felt it was a good time to remind the world who is really in control of our world.\nOn June 6th 1968, Peter Lewis chatted with Lennon and Spinetti about a new play they were working on. The filmed interview would air on BBC-2 as part of the arts program ‘Release.’ This is a clip from that interview.\nRelated \nJOHN LENNON’S “IMAGINE” WAS MADE INTO A COMIC STRIP \nRARE FOOTAGE OF JOHN LENNON DESCRIBING HIS UFO EXPERIENCE \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:59:10.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
