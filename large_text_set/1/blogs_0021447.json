So we have to enjoy this, even when we don’t come through after five minutes. That’s how it is. That’s the job to do.” (Photo: Liverpool FC/Getty Images) Jurgen Klopp with Joel Matip and Daniel Sturridge (Photo: Liverpool FC/Getty Images) Roberto Firmino in action (Photo: Liverpool FC/Getty Images) \nWhile Klopp believes that his biggest problem may be the players’ reaction when the Anfield crowd goes quiet, he revealed that his primary focus in the meeting was on the defensive deficiencies that were again exposed at the weekend. \nAnd he explained that he and his staff wanted a clear the air meeting to try to address some of the repeat mistakes the players are making. \n“We have a lot of meetings. It was because the goals we have conceded in 2017 have been a little bit of the same story,” Klopp added.
