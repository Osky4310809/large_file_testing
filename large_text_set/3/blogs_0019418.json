But, having just moved, I can attest to the fact that the majority of that beloved stuff is completely unnecessary. We often hold on to things we think we may need or could potentially use, but if we're honest with ourselves, it's just junk. Getting rid of things is good for you , and Marie Kondo's KonMari Method is all about simplifying your life and becoming healthier and happier by decluttering. Many people have called her books life-changing ; I kept her concepts in mind while moving, and the entire process was SO much better for me than previous times, because I just let. everything. go. \nThe KonMari Method is based on some basic concepts that sound simple in theory, but can be harder when it's time to put them in to action. Still, the challenge is so worth it in the long run, because you will find joy in places you never expected . . . probably hidden underneath piles of crap you don't need, or buried in a junk drawer you haven't opened in years. And really, the more stuff you throw out, the easier and easier it gets. Here's the basic idea of the KonMari Method, aka \"the magic of tidying up.\" 1. Start by discarding. \nSort through your belongings, and begin by getting rid of what you don't need. Embrace the idea of minimalism, and forget about the regular questions you ask yourself when decluttering . Get rid of what doesn't bring you happiness, and get rid of it all at once. \"Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach,\" says Marie Kondo. \"The KonMari Method's category-by-category, all-at-once prescription leads to lasting results.\" ADVERTISEMENT 2. Then organize your space. \n\"My approach is not simply a technique. The act of tidying is a series of simple actions in which objects are moved from one place to another. It involves putting things away where they belong,\" says Kondo. Store items of the same type in the same place, organize things by color, store them vertically, and keep things in small, organized containers and storage units . 3. Only keep things that give you joy. \nThis is the true heart of the KonMari Method. \"A dramatic reorganization of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective. It is life transforming,\" says Kondo. The key to being clutter-free is to ask yourself this one question: \"does this item spark joy?\" If there's something in your home that doesn't do that, then it has to go. Just like that. So, embrace what sparks joy in your home, and say goodbye to everything else. It's almost like magic . . .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T20:41:40.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
