Valencia are defending in organised fashion, making it tough for the visitors to break their lines. Eventually, Modric is forced to play a long crossfield pass straight out of play. Zidane will have a lot to say at the break, at this rate. 26' Tensions are rising a little bit, as Zaza is involved in a little off-the-ball incident. The Italian and Carvajal have a physical battle, before Nani comes over to get his teammate out of trouble. It would really undo all of the hosts' good work if they were to get a silly red card. 24' Carvajal tries to deliver a cross in from the right-hand side, but the ball loops straight behind for a goal-kick. The cutting edge and final ball hasn't been quite right in the final third for Real Madrid so far. A couple of injuries slow the play down a bit, with Marcelo and then Enzo Perez getting knocks for their trouble. 22' Great save from Diego Alves! Benzema is gifted the space to shoot from around 25 yards out, sending a curling right-footed effort towards the top-right corner. The Valencia goalkeeper gets up well to claw the ball away and behind for a corner. The set-piece comes to nothing. 20' Munir gives the ball away to Marcelo, but a cross from the Brazil international is headed to safety by Garay. Valencia's centre-backs have been dominant in the air so far tonight. Real Madrid are being limited by hopeful deliveries into the penalty area, and thus far it isn't coming off for them at all. 19' Yellow Card Simone ZazaThe Mestalla is absolutely rocking at the bottom, nobody would have expected this game to start in such explosive fashion. Zaza gets the first booking of the match, after sliding in cynically on Sergio Ramos on the half-way line. Perhaps a little harsh. 17' Valencia are all over their opponents, who haven't been allowed to breathe since Zaza's wondrous opener. It might take a little while for Real Madrid to get this contest back within their control. Ronaldo is picked out deep inside the penalty area, but can only fire a low shot within Diego Alves' grasp. Comfortable save from the Brazilian shot-stopper. 15' Ronaldo surges to the left byline, before cutting a low cross to the back post, but James' goal-bound shot is blocked on the line by Munir. That is a little better from Los Blancos! Voro's men are sitting back and coaxing Real Madrid forward, before racing forward committing players on the counter. 13' Ronaldo cuts in from the left-hand side and lets fly with his right foot, but the Portuguese star can only rattle a low strike wide of the near post. Diego Alves covers his angles, just to make sure, but the Brazilian was never really in trouble. Real Madrid don't appear to know which way to turn, Valencia have them on the ropes. The hosts break down the left and Munir is found by a cross, but Spaniard's low shot is deflected over by Marcelo! 11' The Mestalla is rocking now, with Real Madrid shell-shocked by these opening minutes. Two quick break-away goals are giving Valencia a great platform for the rest of this contest. The away side earn themselves a corner which is worked towards Ronaldo at the back post, but a tame header is gathered up by Diego Alves. 9' Assist Luís Carlos Almeida da CunhaNani bides his time before spotting Orellana in the clear and finding him well. 9' Goal Fabián Ariel Orellana ValenzuelaG AL! ORELLANA GETS HIS FIRST GOAL FOR VALENCIA! Zaza starts a break and opens the ball out to the left-hand side, before Nani picks his throughball beautifully. The ex-Celta Vigo midfielder strides into space, before slotting a finish through Navas. Poor goalkeeping. 8' The away side win themselves their second corner of the game, but it comes to nothing. James then tries to flight in a cross from the right, but Mangala stands tall at the near post to nod the danger away. Voro's men have had all of the answers to what has been a quite direct start to proceedings from Los Blancos. Marcelo overlaps down the left and bends in a low cross, but Garay flicks away bravely. 6' The home fans have responded well to that opening goal, and Real Madrid suddenly have a game on their hands. Despite the away side seeing more of the ball in the first two minutes, that first attack from Valencia proved damaging. Ronaldo is picked out by a cross from the right, but Garay heads away. 4' Assist Munir El Haddadi MohamedMunir picks out the Italian striker, who sets himself up beautifully to open the scoring. 4' Goal Simone ZazaG AL! WHAT A STRIKE FROM ZAZA! Cancelo is fed down the right, and then plays a pass into the path of Munir on the same flank. The Barcelona loanee curls in a low cross, which Zaza sets up nicely with his right foot. With his left, he swivels and fires a half-volley inside the far post brilliantly. Pure inspiration. 3' Zidane's men have got going early on and are retaining possession quite well. Voro said pre-match that Valencia wouldn't sit back and defend for the 90 minutes, but they've not had much choice so far. 2' Real Madrid win themselves an early corner on the left-hand side, which James takes short. A cross is swung in towards the back post by Marcelo, but Varane is unable to get up high enough at the back post to nod home a close-range finish. Bright start from the visitors. 1' We are underway in the first half at the Mestalla! Valencia's players and fans alike will be hoping for a continuation of their last game, where they made Athletic Bilbao look very ordinary indeed. Real Madrid, meanwhile, are on the title hunt. Real Madrid substitutes: Nacho, Bale, Kiko Casilla, Kovacic, Lucas Vazquez, Morata, Isco. Real Madrid starting line-up (4-3-3): Navas; Dani Carvajal, Varane, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo; Kroos, Casemiro, Modric; James, Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo. Valencia substitutes: Siqueira, Mario Suarez, Bakkali, Jaume, Carlos Soler, Alvaro Medran, Abdennour. Valencia starting line-up (4-2-3-1): Diego Alves; Joao Cancelo, Garay, Mangala; Jose Gaya; Dani Parejo, Perez; Munir, Orellana, Nani; Zaza. TEAM NEWS: James Rodriguez has another chance to impress on the right-hand side of the Real Madrid attack, with Gareth Bale held in reserve on the bench. It is clear that Zidane doesn't want to rush the Welshman back. Sergio Ramos, Raphael Varane and Marcelo return in defence, with Keylor Navas back in between the sticks. Karim Benzema leads the line ahead of Alvaro Morata, with Isco taking a seat on the bench after being instrumental against Espanyol. TEAM NEWS: Valencia are without Martin Montoya due to a calf problem, which sees Joao Cancelo come into the team at right-back. Simone Zaza retains his place up top after scoring last time out, with Munir deployed on the right-hand side of the attack. New signing Fabian Orellana will be hoping to kick on from registering his first assist for the club against Athletic. Nani will be key on the left wing, with Jose Gaya fit enough to replace Guilherme Siqueira at left-back. Voro will be feeling confident, after Los Che defeated Athletic Bilbao here on the weekend, which actually saw them keep back-to-back clean sheets in the league for the first time since 2015. Valencia need to pick up some more points to prevent themselves from sliding towards the relegation battle, but Real Madrid have their own important agenda to fulfil. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Real Madrid's midweek away clash against Valencia in LaLiga, as Zinedine Zidane's men start to feel the effects of a congested fixture list. Los Blancos have two games in hand at the top of the table, but will be aware that it has been a while since they have registered a league win at the Mestalla.
