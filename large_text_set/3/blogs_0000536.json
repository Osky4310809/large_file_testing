These verses and prayer for a child will assist you in reflecting on God's Word and remembering his promises as you dedicate your precious gift back to God in prayer. Bible Verses for a Child \n1 Samuel 1:26-26 \"[Hannah to the Priest Eli] As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD. I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him. So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD.\" (NIV) \nPsalm 127:3 Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him. (NLT) \nProverbs 22:6 Direct your children onto the right path, and when they are older, they will not leave it. (NLT) \nMatthew 19:14 But Jesus said, \"Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those who are like these children.\" (NLT) Christian Prayer for a Child \nDear Heavenly Father, \nThank you for this treasured child of mine. Although you have entrusted this child to me as a gift, I know he or she belongs to you. Like Hannah offered Samuel , I dedicate my child to you, Lord. I recognize that he is always in your care. \nHelp me as a parent, Lord, with my weaknesses and imperfections. Give me strength and godly wisdom to raise this child after your Holy Word. Please, supply supernaturally what I lack. Keep my child walking on the path that leads to eternal life. Help him to overcome the temptations of this world and the sin that would so easily entangle him. \nDear God, send your Holy Spirit daily to lead, guide and counsel him. Always assist him to grow in wisdom and stature, in grace and knowledge, in kindness, compassion, â€‹and love. May this child serve you faithfully, with his whole heart devoted to you all the days of his life. May he discover the joy of your presence through daily relationship with your Son, Jesus. \nHelp me never to hold on too tightly to this child, nor neglect my responsibilities before you as a parent. Lord, let my commitment to raise this child for the glory of your name cause his life to forever testify of your faithfulness. \nIn the name of Jesus, I pray. \nAmen. A Baby's Blessing is an original Christian poem written as a prayer for parents to say, asking God to bless their child with an excellent, godly life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:27:08.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
