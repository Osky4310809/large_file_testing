Religious nonprofits already enjoy the hyper-privileged status of being exempt from both taxes and financial disclosure. The repeal of the Johnson Amendment would unleash a new wave of dark money into the political system, effectively transforming houses of worship into the equivalent of religious Super PACS. Americans of every faith and none must rally to defend this crucial piece of the wall of separation between church and state.” \nThis is not the first time Trump has promised to overturn the amendment. \nIn September, at the Voter Values Summit, Trump made the same pledge to overturn the amendment and also vowed to make taxpayer money available to religious schools. \nAt the time, Decker stated that “Donald Trump’s pledge to repeal the Johnson Amendment stands as one of the greatest threats to the separation of church and state.” \nThat statement has never been truer. \nNow as president, Trump is continuing to push the threat. \nWith his preferred method of governing by Executive Order, it is not hard to imagine such sweeping laws going into effect without congress and even without legal council.
