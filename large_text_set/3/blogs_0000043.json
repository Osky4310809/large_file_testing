The First Lady wore a black suit with glittering sequins, which is reportedly the first time in history that a first lady has worn sequins to such an event.\nAccording to Women's Wear Daily, the ensemble was designed by Michael Kors, and cost about $10,000.\nOn social media, her apparel was widely criticized, with some comparing the look to the gaudy style made famous by Joan Collins on the television show Dynasty. She looked like she was going to a New Year's Eve party, some said.\nIvanka Trump also caused controversy with her pink outfit, a $3,000 cocktail dress designed by Roland Mouret Rawlings.\nIn contrast, President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan all dressed conservatively, opting for navy suits with white shirts blue ties.\nWhile the audience found plenty to criticize about Melania's and Ivanka's choice of clothes, President Trump's speech was well-received by the public at large, reports CBS News.\nAlthough more Republicans viewed the speech than did Democrats, forty percent of Democrats at least somewhat approved, and 18 percent strongly approved, according to a poll conducted immediately after the conclusion of the president’s address.\nTrump's stated plans to build roads and bridges was the issue most popular with Democrats, although they remain skeptical overall about his plans moving forward, with only a quarter being optimistic.\nSteve Beshear, former governor of Kentucky, delivered the official Democratic rebuttal to Trump's speech, which began:\nMr. President, as a candidate, you promised to be a champion for families struggling to make ends meet, and I hope you live up to that promise. But one of your very first executive orders makes it harder for those families to even afford a mortgage. Then you started rolling back rules that provide oversight of the financial industry and safeguard us against another national economic meltdown. And you picked a cabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders who want to eviscerate the protections that most Americans count on and that help level the playing field. That’s not being our champion. That’s being Wall Street’s champion.\nBeshear also accused Trump and his fellow Republicans of planning to \"rip affordable health insurance away from millions of Americans who most need it,\" as quoted in the transcription published by The New York Times.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T17:14:21.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
