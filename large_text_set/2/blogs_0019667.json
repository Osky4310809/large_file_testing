Their next game is on Wednesday evening when they play Valencia away. \nThat game is an opportunity for Real Madrid to go four points clear in La Liga, with a game in hand. Marcelo loves it \nAs you would expect, those players training at Real Madrid today looked in good spirits. \nAnd, we join them in a Rondo exercise, on the video below. \nBrazilian Casemiro, who is in the midst of an outstanding season, plays the ball through Cristiano Ronaldo’s legs. \nCue much delight from Marcelo, who is standing next to his fellow Brazilian. So excited is Marcelo that he runs and dances around Casemiro! \nProof, if it were still needed, that Cristiano Ronaldo is still human, his latest picture on Instagram suggests he is enjoying life right now though.
