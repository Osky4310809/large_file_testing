Leonard Glenn Francis who earned his nickname thanks to his 25-stone frame \nT hey are all accused of taking bribes from Leonard Glenn Francis, who earned his nickname thanks to his 25-stone frame. He faces up to 25 years in prison after admitting defrauding the Navy of tens of millions of dollars. \nFrancis used his expensive gifts to persuade officers steer naval vessels to ports operated by his company, Glenn Marine Defense Asia, where he overcharged for providing fuel, water and logistics support. \nHe laid on sex parties for officers of the USS Blue Ridge, the 7th fleet’s flag ship, according to the newly unsealed indictment, which details the litany of accusations. \nO n one occasion in 2006, he picked up a $20,000 (£16,000) restaurant bill for officers in Hong Kong.

He was sentenced to 46 months in prison last year after admitting his role in the scandal. \nIn all, 13 have pleaded guilty while several other cases are pending.
