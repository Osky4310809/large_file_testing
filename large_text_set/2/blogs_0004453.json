That's a fight I would love and he said he was keen to come to the UK and fight me, so that's always a possibility. Lee Selby on Abner Mares \n\"I saw him at the weigh-in,\" Selby told Sky Sports . \"He said 'let's do it'. I said 'listen, we can do it now,' and he made a joke about not bringing his shorts. \n\"That's a fight I would love and he said he was keen to come to the UK and fight me, so that's always a possibility.\" \nSelby would endure a further setback as a discussed unification clash with Frampton appears to have been put back, with the Northern Irishman pushing for a third fight with Santa Cruz after losing his WBA 'super' title in a points defeat. Carl Frampton suffered a points defeat in his second fight against Leo Santa Cruz \n\"I would have boxed and won, looked good,\" said Selby. \"Frampton would have won and then that would have set up a unification fight for the summer back home. \n\"The worst case scenario was what happened. I didn't even fight and Frampton got beat. It's put things back a bit.\" \nInstead of returning to the ring, Selby was a spectator at the MGM Grand, and found it hard to watch the Frampton-Santa Cruz rematch. The Welshman has not fought since his victory over Eric Hunter last April \n\"That emotions going through me, I couldn't explain,\" he said. \"I put something out on my social media and one guy said get over it, it's only a fight. \n\"To me, it's not a fight, it's my life. My life revolves around my children, my family, and boxing. \n\"If I'm not in the boxing gym, I'm in the house with my family. I don't go out, I don't party, don't drink or nothing. My life is boxing and my family.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:29:46.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
