Beatty, in confusion, handed the card to his Bonnie and Clyde co-star Dunaway who, failing to notice, incorrectly named Damien Chazelle's musical as the winner of the evening's biggest award (“In other words, Clyde threw Bonnie under the bus). \n“As I'm sure you heard, La La Land was simultaneously somehow the biggest winner and loser last night,” Kimmel quipped. Here’s the INSIDE story of what happened at the craziest #Oscars ever last night… @TheAcademy @ABCNetwork pic.twitter.com/w6xgsoaXSM — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) February 28, 2017 \nKimmel explained how he was supposed to end the ceremony from the audience sat next to his 'frenemy' Matt Damon when he noticed something had gone wrong and that Barry Jenkins' acclaimed drama Moonlight had actually won Best Picture. \nHe continued: “And now so we have the producers of two movies on stage and who the hell knows who is who from each movie, and I'm standing there like an idiot feeling bad for these guys but also trying really hard not to laugh, to be honest.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:05:32.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
