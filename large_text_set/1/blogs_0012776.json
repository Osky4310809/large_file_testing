This range will provide the best comfort for your family while helping to protect your musical instruments, drywall, wooden furniture and other belongings or materials from the damaging effects of dryness or excessive moisture.As relative humidity levels actually fluctuate depending on climate and air temperature, I've provided an average range to make it simpler to follow. How a home handles humidity depends on many factors including design, construction, vapor retarders and how airtight the building is. You can learn more about relative humidity by following the links provided below.​ \nWhat Happens When Humidity is Too High? \nWhen there is too much moisture in your home, moist air gets trapped in corners, basements, and other closed areas. This is often very noticeable in bathrooms when moisture gathers in corners and creates mildew that is difficult to remove. Condensation can also accumulate in windows, causing water to drip down the window and wooden frames to rot. This moisture provides a perfect breeding ground for bacteria 5 Signs You Need a Dehumidifier \nHow to Remove Excess Humidity \nWhat method you choose to remove moisture from the air depends on the severity of the problem, the season and where the dampness is. If it's winter and an area could benefit from heat such as a basement, heating that space could return it to a proper moisture level. \nHowever, if humidity is excessive you may need a combination of both heat and a dehumidifier to reach proper levels. A damp bathroom can benefit from an open window, or a ceiling exhaust fan to draw the moist air or shower/bath steam to the exterior of the home. In spring when heating is not an option, running a dehumidifier is your best option for removing dampness from the basement or main floor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T18:09:40.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
