Barris was also the creator of The Newlywed Game , where married couples answered questions that would highlight whether they were compatible. \nAt the time , the shows were considered frivolous, at best. \nCollectively, the shows earned Barris the nickname “the King of Schlock.” However, as times changed, sequels, spinoffs and shows replicating his ideas convinced him he was just ahead of his time. \n“Today these shows are accepted,” he said in 2003. “These shows aren’t seen as lowering any bars.” \nDuring a long and creative post-TV career, Barris became an author, and wrote a book in which he claimed he was a CIA assassin. \nAsked once about that claim, Barris said, “I don’t answer that question, ever. I can just tell you that the No. 2 guy in the CIA said that I must have been standing too close to the gong when I said things like that.” \nOne anecdote, however, made it clear Barris knew why he would be remembered. \n“When you go to that great game show in the sky,” he asked himself during a 2007 appearance, “would you rather be known as an author or as a TV game show producer?” \n“That’s the easiest question of all,” he responded. “I would love to be known as an author, but I don’t think it’s written that that’s the way it’s going to be. I think on my tombstone it’s just going to say, ‘Gonged at Last,’ and I’m stuck with that.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
