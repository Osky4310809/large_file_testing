'Panthers a year away' 0:48 \n“I think it’s a little bit unfair to have them going in as favourites,” Girdler told NRL Tonight . \n“They’re a young side with young players in key positions and I think that’s where they’ll struggle at the back end of the season. \n“They’ll be there when the whips are cracking, but if you put them against the Storm or Cowboys in a prelim final, I’m just not sure they’re there yet. \n“I think next year will be there year.” \nJOB GROUNDING RAIDERS GUN \nHe’s one of the brightest young stars in the competition with his whole first grade career ahead of him, but Nick Cotric has revealed he still takes time out of his busy schedule to help out at his family restaurant. \nThe 18-year-old, who will make his NRL debut on Saturday against North Queensland, has just finished his first full pre-season with the Raiders’ first grade squad.

Picture: Kym Smith Source: News Corp Australia \nBut despite all the hype surrounding him, he hasn’t forgotten where he’s come from. \n“I’d work there every day if I could, but now it’s pretty hard with training so I just go once or twice a week and just do what Dad says,” Cotric told The Canberra Times . \n“I just bake the pizzas, make pizzas and just serve customers sometimes or just clean up out the back.” \nBen Ikin, Nathan Ryan and Ben Glover are joined by Raiders director of recruitment Peter Mulholland to discuss Canberra’s season-eve wheeling and dealing as well as all the big headlines from the off-season transfer bonanza. \nYou can also subscribe via iTunes or for Android users, listen on the iPP Podcast Player app. \n‘IT’S A WORK IN PROGRESS’ \nSouth Sydney star Sam Burgess has been criticised at times for his fiery temper during games. \nEven Brisbane and England coach Wayne Bennett had a bit to say during the Four Nations tournament. \nThe big bopper has hinted we may see a different side of him on the field this season. Burgess working on aggression 1:11 \n“I get on really well with Wayne ... he’s got his reasons for saying that,” Burgess told NRL Tonight . \n“It’s been a work (in progress) my whole career — being on that line of aggression and going over it. \n“To play in the NRL, you need a certain level of that. It’s just whether you can use it in the right ways. \n“ ... I’ll take that on board and I’ve been working on it through the pre-season. People have been niggling me, but I’ve just been keeping calm. We’ll see how we go this year.” \nGIRDLER: POWER GAME THE KEY \nFormer NRL star Ryan Girdler is looking forward to an evolving style of football this season. \nGirdler believes we’ll see more sides play a more entertaining brand. Girdler: Power game is key 0:59 \n“At the back end of last year, I think there was a fundamental change in some of the styles with some of the teams who were successful,” Girdler told NRL Tonight. \n“I’m excited to see some of those sides go around this year. \n“Simple go-forward through the middle, simple dummy half play, some variations and then giving the players some football at a retreating defensive line. \n“Canberra and Penrith were doing it at the back end of last year and I think we’ll see some other teams follow suit.” \nLive stream the first round of the NRL on FOX SPORTS.
