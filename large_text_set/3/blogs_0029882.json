So if you raise it up by going to the bathroom you’ll have a harder time knocking out the Zs again.\nThe second thing you should never do entails a fight against every instinct you have.\nAccording to Breus, if you wake up, you should never reach for your phone or even look at your alarm clock for the time.\nShutterstock He explains that looking at the time causes the brain to become agitated and stressed, which are the two of the worst feelings you can have if you want to fall back asleep.\nSo next time you wake up in the middle of the night when you don’t want to, don’t move or even open your eyes!\nAnd if you ever wondered what time you should be going to bed , we told you when you should be going to sleep if you want to wake up feeling fresh.\nWe also showed you pictures from inside the secret bedrooms in planes where pilots and crew sleep on long-haul flights.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:09:41.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
