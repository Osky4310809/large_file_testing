Blow (@CharlesMBlow) January 10, 2017 \nThe fireworks today were supposed to be coming from Jeff Sessions’ confirmation hearing, but CNN managed to light up social media Tuesday afternoon with an exclusive report claiming that President Obama and President-elect Trump were told last week that the Russians have personal and financial information that could compromise Trump. CNN EXCLUSIVE: Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him. https://t.co/aI2SCG7eQu pic.twitter.com/0O2NXQAQIt \n— CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) January 10, 2017 Big news here: https://t.co/dpTGq2KqNY \n— Manu Raju (@mkraju) January 10, 2017 This is big league https://t.co/6Fx9jqcp9M \n— Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) January 10, 2017 Early. But seems big. https://t.co/E5bOp2yiOp \n— Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) January 10, 2017 So Putin has information that he could use to blackmail the president of the United States… Holy shit. https://t.co/XeY9z8mSfz \n— Taegan Goddard (@politicalwire) January 10, 2017 I don't want to be dramatic, but just FYI, the biggest scandal in American political history may be breaking as we speak…. https://t.co/Io1wWd8AYE \n— Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) January 10, 2017 WOW: Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him https://t.co/HCbWCFN3wc @CNN \n— Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) January 10, 2017 @joshrogin @CNN this is like presidency ending if true \n— Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) January 10, 2017 CNN now reporting that Russian spies claim to have personal and financial information that compromises Donald Trump. \n— Matt Viser (@mviser) January 10, 2017 There is apparently a credible report that Russia has compromising personal and financial info on Trump, according to this CNN report \n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) January 10, 2017 Russian mischief. either they have something, or they want all THINKING they have something. either way, cloudy skies. \n— John Donvan (@JohnDonvan) January 10, 2017 This CNN bombshell about Trump and the Russians is really unsettling. This will not end well. This is a real problem. \n— Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) January 10, 2017 How are we even holding cabinet confirmation hearings if there is even a QUESTION as to whether the PEOTUS is compromised?… #RussianHacks \n— Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) January 10, 2017 How are we going to have an inauguration next week? I mean, really. I need to know more about this CNN story on Trump and the Russians… \n— Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) January 10, 2017 It is impossible to overstate the significance, if true, of Russia possessing compromising info of 'personal & financial nature' on Trump \n— Ken Gude (@KenGude) January 10, 2017 So does the press conference still happen? \n— Kate Nocera (@KateNocera) January 10, 2017 \nTo be honest, the press was dropping really big bombshells about Trump at least weekly during the campaign, and yet each one managed to get lost in the excitement of the next. Not to be too cute, but can you really harm his reputation? What do they have? Evidence of sexual harassment? That he didn't pay taxes? https://t.co/Z5kgvMeENr \n— Tim Carney (@TPCarney) January 10, 2017 What could be more compromising than what we've already seen? @CNNPolitics https://t.co/HPFLgSFjFs \n— Michael Smerconish (@smerconish) January 10, 2017 Sourcing obviously key here. Also, what would DJT have to be caught on tape doing to actually shock people at this point? https://t.co/j0DM4xf7hj \n— Mark MacKinnon (@markmackinnon) January 10, 2017 I'd more willing to believe this latest story would end Trump if it weren't for the other 749 stories that should have ended Trump. \n— jon gabriel (@exjon) January 10, 2017 Ahhh, “surely this will be the end of Trump” Twitter is back. Been a while. \n— Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) January 10, 2017 \nMake no mistake, though: media types and pundits are excited. It's like Christmas, all over again. \n— Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) January 10, 2017 Our report just now: https://t.co/S8UDLSCU0Z \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) January 10, 2017 \nCNN reports that Obama and Trump, who were briefed last week on Russian efforts to influence the election, each received a two-page synopsis appended to the report alleging that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about the president-elect. Trending 'We WILL adhere to the rule of law': Ted Cruz shreds Al Franken, highlights why Democrats fear Sessions \nAnd the source? CNN reports that the allegations “came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.” This is going to make a big splash, but let's acknowledge upfront that it's extremely attenuated. https://t.co/ZDavm2kUqb pic.twitter.com/ig8zVfrJM1", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T04:52:25.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
