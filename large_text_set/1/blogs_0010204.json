She does not simply translate, but offers Kraznys commentary on Daenerys's words and diplomatically leaves out Kraznys's insults to the Khaleesi. [3] \nDaenerys meets with Kraznys and other Good Masters and announces her intention to buy all of the eight thousand Unsullied for sale, but Kraznys says she cannot afford them. The slaver grows increasingly insulting and condescending - which makes Missandei struggle to interpret politely. Daenerys then adds she also wants to buy the hundreds of young men still in training. In exchange she offers one of her dragons . The Good Masters agree, but Daenerys also asks for Missandei as a gift and a show of good faith for the upcoming transaction. He agrees, and Missandei follows Daenerys. Daenerys takes Missandei from her slavers. \nDaenerys asks the young slave for her name and if she has any living family, but she says she does not. Daenerys warns her that she is heading into war and she may be killed or may fall sick and die, to which Missandei simply recites the Valyrian aphorism: \"Valar morghulis\". Daenerys responds by correctly interpreting, \"all men must die\" but also adds that \"we are not men\", making Missandei grin. [4] \nMissandei, sporting a new dress to match Daenerys's outfit, is present when Kraznys and Daenerys conduct their exchange. She interprets their exchange until Daenerys fluidly begins issuing orders to the Unsullied in perfectly accented Low Valyrian , at which Missandei stares in shock. Missandei survives the subsequent sack of Astapor and marches out of the city with Daenerys. [5] \nMissandei serves as Daenerys's primary aide-de-camp during the march to Yunkai . On her queen's orders, she gathers the Unsullied officers together and orders them to select a single leader from among themselves. When the new leader, Grey Worm , is presented, Missandei explains that all Unsullied are given names consisting of drab colors and vermin to remind them of their station. Daenerys promptly orders the Unsullied to select their own names, though Grey Worm elects to keep his. [6] Daario dressed as an Unsullied holds a knife at Missandei's throat. \nMissandei later attends to Daenerys and her guests Mero , Prendahl na Ghezn and Daario Naharis . Mero is rather uncouth throughout the whole event, groping Missandei and even trying smell her. In part because of his treatment of Missandei, the khaleesi orders that Mero be killed first if the Unsullied must fight the Second Sons . That night, as Daenerys bathes, she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than nineteen languages. Missandei says this shouldn't be that odd, since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of Dothraki . The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable Dothraki and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an Unsullied enters and hold a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He explains he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains, but they ran into a philosophical disagreement over her beauty. He then releases Missandei and produces his captains' severed heads. [1] \nMissandei is later on hand as Daenerys waits for word of the infiltration of Yunkai [7] and when Yunkai's gates open. She at first recites a prepared speech on how Daenerys has freed the slaves, but the khaleesi interrupts with a speech of her own. When the freed slaves begin calling Daenerys \"mhysa\", Missandei explains the word's Ghiscari origins and its meaning, \"mother\". [8] Edit Missandei watching Daario and Grey Worm gambling. Missandei remains Daenerys's aide-de-camp in the weeks following the fall of Yunkai. When an irritated Daenerys locates Grey Worm and Daario, Missandei informs them that they have been at their contest (balancing their swords to see who will have the honor of riding at the queen's side) since midnight. Missandei is amused when Daenerys threatens to expel the winner of the contest from her army. Later on, Missandei discusses the Great Masters with the queen, and suggests that if they are smart, they should be afraid. [9] \nAt the gates of Meereen, Missandei interprets the words of Meereen's champion to Daenerys. She is clearly reluctant to accurately interpret the Meereenese Valyrian and cleans up the language slightly when relaying the message. A few minutes later, when Daario is selected as the champion, Missandei makes complimentary remarks about him, which Daenerys brushes off. [10] Missandei talking to Grey Worm. \nMissandei is revealed to have been teaching Grey Worm the Common Tongue. As the lessons progress, Missandei and Grey Worm discuss their lost homelands ( Naath and the Summer Isles respectively) and Grey Worm's eagerness to kill the Masters of Slaver's Bay. [11] \nMissandei is later present when Daenerys mulls over the possibility of seizing King's Landing . [12] She later acts as herald and interpreter while Daenerys, acting as queen of Meereen, hears petitions from her new subjects. [13] \nWhile bathing nude in a stream outside the city, Missandei notices Grey Worm gazing at her. Surprised by this, she stands up, allowing him to see her wholly before she covers herself. Missandei and Daenerys talking about Grey Worm in \" The Mountain and the Viper \". \nLater she discusses what happened with Daenerys, who says Unsullied aren't interested in women. Missandei says he was, though, surprising as it seems. Daenerys asks her whether, when a slave is castrated, the masters take both the \"pillar\" and the \"stones.\" Missandei does not know, and Daenerys asks whether she's ever wondered. Missandei thoughtfully confirms she has. Grey Worm later comes to apologize, but she tells him there is no need. She expresses sympathy over what was done to him, but he replies that if it had not happened, the course of events that eventually led to their meeting would not have occurred, which visibly moves her. As he turns to leave, Missandei says she is glad he saw her, to which he says he is as well. She is later present when Jorah is dismissed from Daenerys's service and banished. [14] \nMissandei is again on hand when a farmer delivers to Daenerys the remains of his three-year old girl, who was burned to death by Drogon . [15] Edit Missandei approaches Grey Worm. \nMissandei is with Daenerys when she learns that an Unsullied named White Rat is murdered in a brothel. She then approaches Grey Worm, asking why an Unsullied would want to go to a brothel. Grey Worm states that he does not know and leaves. [16] \nMissandei is at Daenerys's council when they discuss what should be done with the Son of the Harpy who has been arrested. Later, she is present when Mossador is publicly executed for murdering the prisoner before a fair trial could take place. She flees with Daenerys once a riot breaks out after the execution. [17] \nMissandei is present alongside Daenerys and Daario when Hizdahr zo Loraq yet again tries to convince to Daenerys that the fighting pits of Meereen should be reopened. [18] Missandei in tears and concerned, watching over an unconscious Grey Worm. \nMissandei is tearfully watching over Grey Worm as he is lying unconscious on a bed. She is present later when Grey Worm wakes up from lying unconsious in three days. Grey Worm states that he feels ashamed of himself for being afraid, to which Missandei reponds that all men fear death. Grey Worm then says that the reason he was afraid wasn't because of death itself but because he would never be able to see \"Missandei from the Island of Naath\" again. Missandei is touched with tears by this and leans over to give Grey Worm a kiss. Missandei is later asked for advise by Daenerys regarding her current situation. Missandei say that she doesn't think she is fit to give advice to a queen, which Daenerys thinks is absurd and states that she thinks Missandei is as fit as anyone to have a say in this. Missandei says that instead of listening to her counselors Daenerys should perhaps listen to her heart instead. This leads to Daenerys reopening the fighting pits and proposing to Hizdahr. [19] \nMissandei is present when Tyrion and Jorah are brought before Daenerys in the Great Pyramid . She witnesses as Tyrion explains himself and when Jorah is again banished from Meereen. [20] Missandei watches in amazement as Dany rides off on Drogon. \nMissandei later attends Daenerys during the opening games at Daznak's Pit . She remains quiet through most of the proceedings, observing the verbal sparring between Hizdahr and Daario and looking at Dany with concern when Jorah shows up again. When the Sons of the Harpy rise up begin slaughtering the spectators, Missandei is momentarily forgotten by Daario and Jorah, who are busy trying to get Daenerys away. Missandei is rescued by Tyrion, who kills a Harpy's Son and gets them behind a line of Unsullied. Thinking she is about to die, Daenerys grabs Missandei's hand, but the group is rescued by Drogon seconds later. Missandei and the others watch in amazement when Dany rides off on Drogon's back. [21] Missandei convinces Grey Worm to keep the peace in Meereen. \nAs Tyrion, Jorah, and Daario argue over how to proceed, Missandei bring Grey Worm to them. Missandei attempts to explain to Grey Worm how Tyrion saved her, attempts to diplomatically avoid using the High Valyrian for \"dwarf\", although Tyrion, in typical bluntness, corrects her. She repays the favor by telling Tyrion that his High Valyrian is \"rusty\" as opposed to \"nostril\". When Daario and Jorah decide to leave the city and search for Daenerys, Daario tells the other three to stay put, since Missandei, as Daenerys's closest confidante, will be needed to help Grey Worm and Tyrion run Meereen in the queen's absence. [22] Edit \nMissandei works with Tyrion, Grey Worm, and Varys to maintain the Queen's peace in the city. One day, whilst discussing Rhaegal and Viserion , Tyrion mentions that since they were used to Missandei's presence when they were younger, they would probably be comfortable around her now, should they be freed. [23] \nWhilst Varys is dealing with Vala , Tyrion attempts to engage Missandei and Grey Worm in conversation. Neither of them are very good at small talk, however, and both are bewildered by his behavior. When Tyrion tries to engage them in a drinking game, Missandei says that neither of them drink. Tyrion tries to persuade Missandei and Grey Worm to drink with him. \nWhen Varys finally enters and rescues them from the conversation, Missandei cautions against immediate reprisals against Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, since they need their troops to protect Meereen. In a short speech Missandei states the Masters of Slaver's Bay only speak one \"language\" (violence and war), and they must speak it to these Masters, who have united to oppose Meereen. In the end, Tyrion convinces Varys to use his network of little birds to open communications with the cities' leaders. [24] \nMissandei counsels Tyrion before and during his meeting with the Masters of the slave cities of Essos . When Tyrion states that he has experienced the horrors of slavery, Missandei is insulted considering he only experienced slavery for a very short time in comparison to her time as one; she states he does not understand. During the meeting, Missandei defends Daenerys' liberation of the slaves . She has a mixed response to Tyrion's compromise of a seven-year transition period, but reluctantly supports him in front of a delegation of former slaves. In private, she and Grey Worm argue that no matter what, Tyrion will become a pawn of the masters, as that is their way. [25] \nMissandei, along with Grey Worm and Varys, are present when Tyrion holds a meeting with Kinvara , the High Priestess of the Red Temple at Volantis . To convince the Meereenese that everything is going befittingly with Daenerys' blessing, Tyrion secures an agreement with the Red Priestess to preach that Dany is The Prince That Was Promised . [26] Missandei meets with the slave masters. \nLater, Missandei and Grey Worm exchange wine and jokes at the Great Pyramid . While reluctant to drink, Missandei and Grey Worm do so in honor of their Queen. After Tyrion tells a joke about Westerosi lords in a bar, she tells a joke about two translators stranded at sea. While Tyrion feigns amusement, Grey Worm tells her that it was the worse joke he had ever heard. \nThe three friends then celebrate Grey Worm's new-found ability to tell a joke. Shortly later, they hear the sound of bombardment. Looking out the ramparts, they find a massive fleet sent by Astapor, Yunkai, and Pentos bombarding the city with trebuchets. Missandei remarks that the slave cities have returned for their \"property.\" By nightfall, Tyrion admits that his policy of diplomacy was a failure and allows Grey Worm to lead the city's defense. Shortly after, they hear movement on the roof and discover that Daenerys has returned by riding upon Drogon . [27] \nThe following day, Missandei accompanies Grey Worm, Daenerys, and Tyrion during a meeting with representatives from the slavers' cities, including Belicho Paenymion , Razdal mo Eraz and Yezzan zo Qaggaz . In return for allowing Dany and Tyrion to leave unharmed, Razdal demands the return of the Unsullied and Missandei, whom he intends to sell as a slave to the highest bidder. Missandei stands by Daenerys' side as they finally sail for Westeros. \nHowever, Dany undoubtly rejects their offer and unleashes her dragons; Drogon , Viserion and Rhaegal on the slavers' fleet. The Masters cower in fear as Missandei informs them their queen asks for at least one of their lives as payment for their crimes. Grey Worm executes Belicho and Razdalby slicing their throats, who were quick to offer the death of the third slaver. Yezzan zo Qaggaz is spared so that he can bring back word of Dany's power to the slave cities. [28] \nWhen Daenerys finally sets sail to Westeros at the head of the combined Greyjoy , Martell , Meereenese and Tyrell armadas, Missandei joins her and Tyrion on the deck of the flagship. She stands alongside Varys, looking determined to play her continious loyal role in the next part of the game of thrones.
