It's quite a difficult room to do a traditional sort of monologue, so we're trying to do something slightly different with that. But it's quite exciting,\" he said. \"I come up through the floor, which I'm very excited about.\" \nCorden added, \"I'm really trying to not let anybody down and make it a really fun show, that's what I'm trying to do.\" \nHe also joked about how the stakes are higher for the primetime awards show than his \"middle of the night\" talk show. \n\"We make a television show that's on in the middle of the night. People only realize it's on when they've woken up and realize they've left the television on. This is a bit different,\" he said. \nCorden also had a playful exchange with Seacrest when he complimented the E! host's jacket, paused and asked Seacrest if he was going to say anything about his jacket. \nJackie Strause contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:57:24.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
