Any well wishes to share to either party? Let us know your views in the comments below! \nHopefully this opens up a return to wrestling LaurenYorkStan \nUm hopefully the fuck not bitch Shady \nIs this Syllabus or the 10 account person Izzy4lw \nKaitlyn had a lot of untapped potential and really filled the role of that strong brawler that hasn’t been filled in a long time- wrestling may not have been her first love, but I’d love to see her come back- as far along as she came in her original stint, I think with the proper platform (which WWE now has) and with awesome trainers, she could really break out as a force within the division. Number One \nI completely agree! And IF Kaitlyn does return to WWE (not holding my breath, but anything is possible), I pray she does so as a heel jbrizzy \nHer husband was on a gay porn site before their marriage. She is better off Stef’ \nyea, he likes to show off his ass… Geek God \nHe always gave me weird vibes and I feel he pressured her to leave WWE. I hope it will work out for her. PoisonYourMind #PYM \nyou knew him? Geek God \nHe definitely did pressure her to leave so i hope she will want to come back now that she’s free glassjaw \nWas it really so essential for DD to post this? Johnny \nNow Kaitlyn should return to wwe QueenSableBomb \nHow he gonna take down her domain like that though? Shady smh Will Henderson \nit’s cause when they were still married, they launched the company together, joint ownership. \njust like if your married and you have joint banking account and all the other joint accounts that couples have when they are single but in a committed relationship/engaged/married. QueenSableBomb \nI understand that but it still doesn’t explain why he’d go so far as to take it down. I’m sure she was hoping for an amicable split but this isn’t a good start to that… Either way it’s a shame that they’re done, I didn’t pay too much attention to them but they seemed good together Glitter Bliss Banks \nAlways thought he was weird aha I just thought he was sketchy and didn’t look that attractive either, his name alone rings bells….shade aside I’m glad Kaitlyn is staying strong and positive, she doesn’t need a man to be successful and she knows it! Good Luck Kaitlyn! Geek God \nI heard he was gay, alot of ppl comment on his pictures on social media asking him if he was, Eva Marie’s husband too ??? Glitter Bliss Banks \nI heard that too, I remember seeing it reported on TMZ and Meltzer or something, I swear even DD reported that he was involved in Gay adult movies on Pornhub or something? and we all freaked because we thought it would effect her title reign lol He so messy, just like Eva’s controlling, egomaniac husband Johnathan, I actually used to like him on the first 2 seasons of Total Divas but then he started to annoy me when he become her “husbanger” and got involved in her Career and work politics, I just don’t like how weird and controlling he is lol Geek God \nIt’s sad that she left the WWE to marry and spend the rest of her life with him but it didn’t work out, but I’m hoping like hell she comes back to the WWE, she was my favorite in her time from the moment she accidently won that battle royal to her feud with Layla & Eve, going crazy on Aksana, her feud with Aj, tool the moment she left, and with this new era, theres so much more she could do now, could yall see her on Raw or Smackdown? Gabriella Panajotova \nWhat happened?
