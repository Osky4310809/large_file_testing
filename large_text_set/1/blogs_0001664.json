Under the deal that Exxon said was developed with ethics regulators to comply with conflict of interest requirements that Tillerson sever all ties with the company, the former chairman and CEO would see the value of the more than 2 million deferred shares that he is owed put into an independently managed trust, and the share awards would be canceled. At current market prices, those shares are worth more than $180 million.\nAnd Tillerson committed to sell the more than 600,000 Exxon share he currently owns, which are currently valued at nearly $55 million.\nThe former oil executive would give up more than $4.1 million in cash bonuses that are scheduled to pay out over the next three years, as well as other benefits such as retiree medical and dental benefits, and administrative, financial and tax support. And he would give up about $3 million in the value of his shares at the establishment of the trust.", "external_links": ["http://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/exxonmobil-tillerson-reach-agreement-comply-conflict-interest-requirements"], "published": "2017-01-03T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T05:56:28.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
