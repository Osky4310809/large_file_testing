The FIFA Council unanimously decided on a 48-team #WorldCup as of 2026: 16 groups of 3 teams. Details to follow after the meeting. â€” FIFA Media (@fifamedia) January 10, 2017 \nWorld Cup-winners Diego Maradona and Carles Puyol have also spoken in favour of the 48-team format, as has Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, who believes it could offer better protection to players. \nSalon d'Or: cast your vote now! \nDFB president Reinhard Grindel had voiced his concerns over the proposal, while the influential European Club Association, which represents the interests of the major sides across the continent, opposed the changes. \n\"In the interest of the fans and the players, we urge FIFA not to increase the number of World Cup participants,\" ECA chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. \"Politics and commerce should not be the exclusive priority in football.\" \nEnglish Football Association chief Martin Glenn also stated before the vote that he would prefer the smaller format to remain. \nThe changed format will see 48 teams split into 16 groups of three teams, with the top two in each progressing to a round-of-32 knockout stage.
