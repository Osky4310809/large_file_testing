Can we get an amen from those loving spouses that think the world of their partners!?\n“I try to keep my private life, private and just try to stick to the work,” 23-year-old Mia told ET while promoting her new film A Cure for Wellness; although she did take the time to gush a little about her controversial significant other . The film, which is described as a “psychological horror thriller film” was directed by adventure-master Gore Verbinski and first premiered late last year, just two months after Shia and Mia (does this make their celeb-combo name just Shia , pronounced Shee-ya ?) tied the knot in Vegas. Sure, this has them still very much in the honeymoon phase, but we are so in love with couples who are, well, also in love. It’s contagious!\nThe couple that praises each other, stays together.

LaBeouf was not in attendance for the premiere, most likely due to the filming of this fall’s Borg vs. McEnroe , in which Shia plays a young John McEnroe as we follow the famous rivalry between he and fellow tennis player Björn Borg. Can we safely assume Shia is pouring his heart and soul into learning death-defying tennis skills at this very moment? Yes. Yes we can.\n#BorgvsMcEnroe 2017 \nA post shared by Shia LaBeouf (@shialabeoufdaily) on Dec 9, 2016 at 5:41am PST \nSee A Cure for Wellness in theaters everywhere this Friday! And, oh yeah…bring a friend. This is not the kind of thing you want to see alone. Watch the super spooky trailer here (Rated R!).\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:29:07.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
