Nevertheless, old-timey brand Cracker Barrel has seen its Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts come under siege after an employee was allegedly dismissed from one of its Indiana outposts. Following the firing, an angry internet mob is demanding # JusticeForBradsWife . The saga began late last month when some guy named Brad posed a direct question on Cracker Barrel’s Facebook page — “Why did you fire my wife?” — and asked his friends to pose the same question to the old country store. Not only was Brad’s wife fired from Cracker Barrel after 11 years of service, it seems she lost her job on Brad’s birthday. Now, everything Cracker Barrel posts online is smothered with comments about Brad’s wife. There’s even a Change.org petition demanding answers, as People notes . “Eleven years, Cracker Barrel,” the petition reads. “Eleven long, hard years. It is for this reason, we demand answers. Cracker Barrel owes this much to this kind man and his loving wife. While most of this “outrage” likely comes from internet jokesters having a good time, Brad himself appreciates the support. But as of Thursday morning, he’s still waiting for answers. Can't get enough of Eater? Sign up for our newsletter.
