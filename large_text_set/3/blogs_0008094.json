He told police following his arrest early Feb. 22 that he knew it was a mannequin he was attacking.\nSchindler’s court-appointed lawyer declined to comment.\nPolice say surveillance video shows Schindler creep up and hit the mannequin in the head, using two-handed swings of the 4-pound hammer.\n \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
