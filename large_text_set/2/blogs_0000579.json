It’s something you’ve said wrong. It’s that text you regret. It’s that moment you wish you could take back. \nYou keep saying ‘you’ without addressing the fact a relationship takes two people. Relationships take two people to make it work and it takes two people to mess it up. \nSo stop thinking you’re to blame. Stop trying to win them back. Simply stop. \nYou’ll ruin your life trying to hold onto to someone who let go. \nYou’ll ruin your life trying to fix something you didn’t break. \nYou’ll ruin your life worrying about things you can’t change. \nThe moment you shift your focus and channel all the energy into loving yourself, what you’ll learn is it wasn’t you that was the problem. The problem simply was you weren’t right for each other. \nI’ll say it again, you did nothing wrong. There is nothing wrong with you. You just were wrong for each other. \nThe right person will take every mistake and everything you can possibly do ‘wrong’ and they’ll stick it out. They’ll love you through all the bad stuff because you are worth it. You are worth it. \nThere won’t be mistakes and endings with the right person, there will only be solving the problem at hand and staying. The right person will stay. \nSo when something goes wrong with someone, instead of looking at your reflection with a sense of unhappiness and talking badly about yourself, look at your reflection and don’t let someone’s absence influence the way you look at yourself. \nYou have got to get to a point when someone walks away you don’t chase them. \nYou have to get to a point when someone walks away you stand still. \nYou have to get to a point where you realize the difference between the person you want and the person you need. Remember the only person you need in your life is the one who proves they need you in theirs.
