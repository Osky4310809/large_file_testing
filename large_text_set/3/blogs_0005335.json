Moving from SmackDown to Raw could be huge for any WWE Superstar who currently feels stuck on the blue brand without any real options to grow. At the same time, if WWE wants fans to accept Reigns as one of the company’s top-tier talent, the red brand will have to get something pretty significant in return to give up the former WWE World Heavyweight Champion and multi-time WrestleMania headliner. \nWhat follows are the six of the best trades that Stephanie McMahon could ask for from Shane in exchange for the contract of Roman Reigns, if the trade rumors are true. Kane, The Miz and Maryse \nKane is the versatile sort of superstar that can thrive in almost any environment in which he’s used — heel or face, destructive or comedic, corporate or demonic. While he’s certainly past his prime, he’s still a legitimate threat to anyone in the ring and still gets a reaction from the WWE Universe. Despite his versatility, he’s been seriously underused on SmackDown LIVE . \nMeanwhile, the blue brand has been teasing a trade for The Miz since the first time he butted heads with General Manager Daniel Bryan. Assuming they have no plans for him to wear the WWE Championship in the near future, there won’t be much left for The Miz to do on SmackDown after his program with John Cena and Nikki Bella at WrestleMania 33 . \nThen, upon their arrival to Monday Night Raw , Mick Foley could force Kane and The Miz to be a tag team, creating an odd couple dynamic that would be a fun way to bring them over to Monday nights. Both have had success in similar situations, when Kane was part of Team Hell No with Daniel Bryan and The Miz teamed with Damien “Mizdow” Sandow. John Cena \nSince John Cena is now owning up to the fact that he often takes time off from WWE to fulfill other Hollywood obligations, it makes more sense for Cena to be a part of Monday Night Raw , where the roster is larger and his absences would be felt less. And since John Cena and Roman Reigns are very polarizing in almost the exact same way, it makes sense to keep them on separate programs. Could WWE send John Cena to Monday Night Raw and Roman Reigns to SmackDown LIVE? [Image by WWE] Randy Orton and AJ Styles \nIt certainly wouldn’t be surprising if WWE billed the Roman Reigns move as a “blockbuster” trade with multiple main event stars involved. The recent coverage of the NBA trade rumors shows that big names equal buzz, so why not send another big name from Monday Night Raw along with Reigns to SmackDown LIVE ? If you packaged Reigns with Seth Rollins, a fair trade could include the pairing of Randy Orton and AJ Styles. A trade like this works on many levels. \nFor starters, it would mean that all three members of The Shield would be working on the same brand, always allowing for an impromptu reunion that the WWE Universe goes crazy for. It also provides AJ Styles with a fresh selection of opponents, after he spent a significant portion of 2016 as the WWE Champion on SmackDown . It would also give Randy Orton the opportunity to work with relative newcomers like Samoa Joe, Finn Balor, Sami Zayn, Braun Strowman and Big Cass. \nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T00:00:43.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
