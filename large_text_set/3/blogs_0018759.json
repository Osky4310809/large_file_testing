Samuel Ortom, the leadership of Buruku Local Government Council and the security agencies in sanitising the area of hostilities. \n“At the same time we are wary of the statement allegedly credited to the governor requesting herdsmen to relocate out of the state.’’ \nOthman-Ngelzarma described the statement by the governor as unconstitutional and pointed out that herdsmen could not be exempted from enjoying similar rights of free movement as being enjoyed by other Nigerians. \n`We demand that the laws of the land must be allowed to function without let or hindrance,’’ he said. \nOrtom had given Fulani herdsmen in Tombo-Mbalagh, Buruku Local Government Area of Benue two days to leave the area following a weekend attack in which eight people died. \nHe gave the order during an assessment visit to the area and said armed herdsmen were not welcome in the state. \nThe governor said that as the chief security officer of the state he had a responsibility to protect the people.
