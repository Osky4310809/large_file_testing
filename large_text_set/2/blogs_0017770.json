EPA It adds that the Customs and Border Protection agency must “immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as patrol and access roads, along the land border with Mexico in accordance with existing law.”\nBut the memos fall short of a full roll-back of Obama era policies. Not mentioned in either of the documents is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, which effectively gave reprieve to illegal immigrant children already in the US illegally.\nAdditionally, the memos do not call for National Guard troops to round up illegals, as a leaked draft memo last week stated .\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:06:13.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
