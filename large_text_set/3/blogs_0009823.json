Image caption Carl Sargeant said tenants will be informed \"in good time\" \nTo remain compliant with human rights legislation, the Welsh Government will give tenants at least a year to exercise their rights if they want to buy their home. \nCouncils will also still be able to sell housing stock once the abolition comes into force, but only on a voluntary basis and at the market rate without the discounts that were seen under the compulsory Right to Buy scheme. \nThe rights will be abolished across the housing sector - including housing associations and council homes. \nA number of local authorities have already suspended the scheme in their area. \nCommunities secretary Carl Sargeant said: \"I recognise the proposal affects existing tenants and we will ensure tenants are made aware of the effect of the bill in good time before abolition takes place.\" Image caption David Melding said Labour had not built enough affordable homes \nMatthew Dicks, director of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: \"We have a huge shortage of affordable housing in Wales and CIH Cymru supports any measure that will stop the further loss of social housing stock which is what this bill intends to do.\" \nBut he said the main issue was that social housing stock, lost through Right to Buy, had not been sufficiently replaced. \nThe Welsh Conservatives have long opposed the proposal by the Welsh Government to abolish the scheme. \nThe party's housing spokesman, David Melding, said: \"There is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Wales because Labour hasn't built enough affordable homes, and not because council tenants have had a chance to buy theirs.\" \nCouncillor Dyfed Edwards, the Welsh Local Government Association's spokesperson for housing, said the move was \"a welcome step in tackling a growing problem in Wales\". \nPlaid Cymru supports abolishing the Right to Buy - meaning it is unlikely Labour will have trouble getting the law - being introduced to the assembly on Monday - passed by AMs. \nA Plaid spokeswoman said: \"We welcome the proposed move to scrap it altogether and regret that the Labour Welsh Government has taken so long to abolish this most Thatcherite of policies. \nThe Welsh Government said it had set a target of creating 20,000 affordable homes during the current assembly term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T09:59:50.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
