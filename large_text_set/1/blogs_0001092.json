Ibrahim Magu \nMalami told Vanguard on telephone that his office was working in concert with Magu in the pursuit of President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption war, pointing out that there was no reason for a divided house. \nSpeculations had been rife that Malami and other top aides of Mr. President we’re opposed to Magu’s confirmation by the Senate because of the EFCC’s acting Chairman’s refusal to take instructions from the OHAGF. \nBut Malami distanced himself from any plot against Magu, pointing that that doing anything against him would amount to working against Buhari’s graft war. \n“Let me just say that there is no truth whatever in the ongoing claims that we are working against each other. There is absolutely nothing like that,” Malami said. \nHe confirmed that following the security report raised against Magu by the Department of State Service, DSS, Mr. President directed him to investigate the claims and report back to him for further actions. \nMalami said that although the investigation of Magu and the Secretary to the Federal Government, David Babachir, had begun, no report on the two men had yet been submitted to the president. \nThe minister expressed surprise over reports that Magu had been replaced by President Buhari following the alleged submission of the report of his investigation of the EFCC acting chair, noting it that the assignment was ongoing.
