He was four years older, he retired at 71 and I’m 67. \n“Maybe I will do four seasons more, maybe less, I don’t know. Everybody is different. \n“I do not want to take anything away from Ferguson, he was an ­absolutely unbelievable manager. But he had had enough. I’m not at that stage.” (Photo: Arsenal FC via Getty) \nWenger refused to divulge whether or not he had offers from other clubs but over the years Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and the FA, among others, have ­coveted his services. \nFor now, he must refocus his players ahead of tomorrow’s tricky trip to Sutton in the FA Cup. \nHope \nBut he insists he has not given up hope of closing the gap on Chelsea in the Premier League. \nWenger added: “You keep ­defeats like Wednesday’s with you for your whole life but... \n“The FA Cup isn’t the only ­competition... the championship is not over and we have to fight for the championship as well. \n“The future gives you hope.
