Her most recent gift to Power Rangers fans happened to be a new photo with the caption \"It’s Valentine’s Day, love is in the air… try not to breathe. #RepulsaTakesOver.\" \nThe new image is a full body shot of Rita, who many suspect to be the original Green Ranger. That would explain why her costume is so different from her original series counterpart, opting for bright green as opposed to her brown and tan getup she used to sport. Lending further evidence to that theory is a recent look at Goldar, which shows a cockpit of sorts that a Rita figure can fit in. \nYou can view the new image in the gallery. \nPower Rangers is currently holding a 3.36 out of 5 on ComicBook.com's anticipation rankings.
