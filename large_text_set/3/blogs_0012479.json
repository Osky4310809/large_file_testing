The FC crew criticise Arsene Wenger's inability to move past Arsenal's Champions League exit against Bayern Munich. \nLONDON -- Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says reports that his first-team assistant Boro Primorac could be leaving the club were \"a complete invention.\" \nThe Sun had reported on Wednesday that Primorac, who has worked alongside Wenger at Arsenal since 1996, was a candidate to take over as manager at Turkish side Konyaspor. \nBut Wenger, whose own future is uncertain beyond this season, rejected the report. \n\"That's a complete invention,\" Wenger said on Thursday at a news conference ahead of Saturday's visit to West Brom. \nPressed on whether it was \"fake news,\" Wenger replied: \"Fake news. It's good today -- you say anything and everybody takes it without checking any information. Everybody just takes it and makes a subject. It's not serious.\" Boro Primorac has worked alongside Arsene Wenger at Arsenal since 1996. \nThe 62-year-old Primorac, a former centre-back who was a Yugoslavia international during his playing career, first started working under Wenger during his stint in Japan at Nagoya Grampus in 1994 and has been a key part of his backroom staff ever since. \nA club spokesperson had earlier told Sky that talk Primorac would leave was \"wild speculation.\" \nWenger also dismissed reports in Spain that Barcelona have renewed their interest in right-back Hector Bellerin, who signed a new six-year deal with the Gunners this season. \nWenger said he was not aware of any approach from Barcelona for the Spaniard. \n\"No. He just extended his contract . It's an unbelievable amount of years to go,\" Wenger said. \"I believe again it's very difficult to take these things seriously.\" \nMattias is ESPN FC's Arsenal correspondent.
