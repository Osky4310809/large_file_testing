The Cause of Death Was Not Yet Released 66 Alan Colmes of @FoxNews has passed away. pic.twitter.com/m56n4Dr9Jh \n— Valerie Vining (@ValerieVining) February 23, 2017 \nHow did Colmes die? The cause of death was not immediately known as word started to break of Colmes’ death on the morning of February 23. \nColmes was the host of the Alan Colmes radio show. His program with Hannity ended in 2009. Hannity told Fox, “Alan, in the midst of great sickness and illness, showed the single greatest amount of courage I’ve ever seen.” \nFox News released this statement from Colmes’ family, “Alan Colmes passed away this morning after a brief illness. He was 66 years old. He leaves his adoring and devoted wife, Jocelyn Elise Crowley. He was a great guy, brilliant, hysterical, and moral. He was fiercely loyal, and the only thing he loved more than his work was his life with Jocelyn. He will be missed. The family has asked for privacy during this very difficult time.” \nColmes was also an author. He wrote the 2003 book, “Red, White & Liberal: How Left Is Right and Right Is Wrong” and “Thank the Liberals for Saving America” in 2012. He was a contributor on Fox News, a network he had appeared on since 1996. \nIt was clear that Colmes’ death was not entirely unexpected as Fox had a pre-planned tribute prepared to run for him. 3.

A few minutes later, Fox News anchor Brit Hume also wrote on Twitter that Colmes had died. Even minutes after his death was officially announced by Fox, the site was still tweeting. \nThis was Colmes’ last tweet: Actual economists: Trump’s rosy forecast is baloney https://t.co/nm0FZfyBX2 \n— Alan Colmes (@AlanColmes) February 23, 2017 \nAnd the one before it: Jason Chaffetz finds a new way to waste your taxpayer dollars https://t.co/EfRsrvTkBB \n— Alan Colmes (@AlanColmes) February 23, 2017 \nHe had also tweeted just 12 hours before about a Sen.
