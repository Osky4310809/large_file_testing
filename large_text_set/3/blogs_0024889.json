She had landed a role in the latest Marvel Comics’ movie, “Logan.” \n“I was super excited,” said Westerfield, a sixth grader at the Fulton Science Academy. “I loved the X-Men series and my favorite character was Mystique, played by Jennifer Lawrence. I did aspire to be in a superhero movie, but being an actress I’m interested to play in all types of roles. But action and dramas have been what I’m trying to aim for.” \nIn “Logan”— the latest film about the most iconic X-Men member, Wolverine — Westerfield plays the role of Rebecca. She is one of many children created for war in a lab in Mexico in the year 2029. The mutant kids escape and eventually encounter the Wolverine, portrayed, of course, by Hugh Jackman. \nThe film hit theaters March 3. \nMORE ﻿ALPHARETTA: St. Francis grads meet in Sweet 16 \nAs Rebecca, Westerfield’s mutant power is the ability to fly or walk on air. But unfortunately, the scene where her skills were on full display was cut from the theatrical version. She hopes it will be added as a deleted scene feature in the movie’s DVD release. \n“They shot a lot of film, almost too much, and had to cut a lot of the stuff the kids did,” Westerfield said. \nWesterfield, a native of north Fulton, landed her first lead role in a 2016 short horror film, “Smoke & Mirrors.” Per her IMDB page , she also had an uncredited appearance in “Anchorman 2” and appeared in two other films: “Headed South for Christmas” and “Realm of Souls.” \nBut “Logan” is the first time that she has had the opportunity to work alongside mainstream stars like Jackman and Patrick Stewart. \nThere are a few moments in which Jackman and Westerfield share some screen time together. \n“One scene is where the kids are packing our bags and about to head out, and my friend and I are playing soccer and (Jackman) kind of picks up the ball and drop-kicks it over to me,” Westerfield explained. “He was a very nice guy. You don’t feel like you’re talking to someone famous with him. He’s super kind.” \nWHERE TO WATCH: Movie showtimes \nLogan was directed by James Mangold (“3:10 to Yuma,”“Cop Land”), is rated R, runs 135 minutes long and currently has a 92% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes . \nLike North Fulton County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T13:05:42.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
