Brown posted a heartbreaking, must-watch video after THAT big moment on “This Is Us” If you haven’t seen Tuesday, February 21st’s episode of This Is Us , “Memphis,” then stop reading immediately lest you be spoiled.\n…All good?\nOkay. So . \nAt the end of “Memphis,” Ron Cephas Jones’ William Hill succumbed to stomach cancer during a road trip to the Tennessee city with his son, Randall Pearson (Sterling K. Brown). \nBrown, who seemingly gets just as emotionally wrecked watching his show as we do, immediately took to Facebook Live after the episode’s end to process his feelings with fans. In a whopper of a 12-minute video (therapy session?), Brown addressed everything from working with Jones, to the overwhelming fan reaction to This Is Us , to — and this is where he really got us — making additional time for loved ones, because we never know when our time with them might end.\n“I’ve seen this episode a few times now, and it still gets me,” Brown began. “I’m proud of this show, proud of the work, so happy to be a part of something like this. I’ve been doing this for a while, and these kinds of opportunities don’t come along all the time. But man. Ron Cephas Jones…Oh, you guys, I’m so happy you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed doing it. It means the world to me. It means the world to me that I get to do this for a living.”\n\nThen, after literally crying about the ducks , Brown monologued about the importance of staying in touch with family, saying,\nIf you have family that you haven’t talked to in a while or friends that you feel that you have gotten out of touch with, then call them up. And let ‘em know how much you love them and how much you care because tomorrow is not promised. You got to let the people know while they’re here how much they’re appreciated and how much you love them.” “There are a lot of people who have to deal with the grief of losing people from this horrible disease, this debilitating disease,” he concluded. “I want those people to know that they’re not alone — that in some small way, we are here with you.”\nGod, this man is a treasure. Here’s to hoping he does not get eaten by the Predator .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:15:29.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
