Wendy's just tweeted and deleted this pic.twitter.com/c7l1nzOKZr — Colin Jones (@colinjones) January 4, 2017 \nThe ADL noted that the amphibian — once simply used for sad situations on the internet — had been hijacked by extreme right-wing groups, which posted it to mock bigotry and anti-Semitism. \n“These anti-Semites have no shame. They are abusing the image of a cartoon character, one that might at first seem appealing, to harass and spread hatred on social media,” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement at the time. \nWendy’s seemingly didn’t get the memo, and deleted the tweet within minutes. \n“Our community manager was unaware of the recent evolution of the Pepe meme's meaning and this tweet was promptly deleted,” the account wrote in a tweet.

After running a fairly standard corporate account, Wendy’s went haywire Dec. 30 when it got into a flamewar with a Twitter user who accused the chain of freezing its beef. \nThus began a so far unstoppable stream of Wendy’s cracking wise with essentially any customer who will tweet at it. When one customer asked how to get a job running the Twitter account, Wendy’s replied, “Job requirements include infinite patience and encyclopedic knowledge of cheeseburgers.” \nUSA Today took notice in a story with now all-too-prophet headline, “Wendy’s is cold on Twitter, some might even say frosty.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T20:27:54.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
