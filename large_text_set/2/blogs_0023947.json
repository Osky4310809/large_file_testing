This map chronicles the most recent additions to the local dining scene — everything that opened (or reopened) in and around Boston since December 21, 2016. \nSo far this season, we've tracked more than 50 openings around Boston proper, Cambridge (particularly Central Square), Somerville, and beyond. Quincy, in particular, has been busy with three winter openings right in Quincy Center (Fuji at West of Center, Pho Pasteur, and Zef Cicchetti & Raw Bar). Melrose has also seen a couple openings this season — T'ahpas 529 and My Diner (which relocated from South Boston) — as has Maynard (Brook Kitchen & Tap and Battle Road Brew House). \nWithin Boston, the openings have been scattered around geographically — one each in Fort Point, Allston, the South End, South Boston, and Charlestown; a couple each in the Seaport District and Dorchester; three each in Back Bay and around Kenmore/Fenway; and four downtown. \nThis new crop of openings represents numerous cuisines, including Italian, Vietnamese, French, Spanish, Cape Verdean, Hawaiian (so much poke), and more. Most of the new restaurants are full-service establishments, but there are a few fast-casual options as well, including Saloniki, Manoa Poke Shop, Oat Shop, Aceituna Grill, and By Chloe. \nIt's been a popular season for expansions of existing local restaurant groups, either with new concepts or new locations of an existing concept. The Highland Kitchen team took over and reopened the shuttered East Coast Grill; Alba added a neighbor and sibling called Zef Cicchetti & Raw Bar; Saloniki hopped across the river from Boston to Cambridge with a second location; the owner of Nijiya and Hoshi-ya opened New Sushi, Inc.; Aceituna Grill expanded from Kendall to the Seaport; Loui Loui expanded from Stoneham (and Fort Lee, NJ) to Allston; three new B.Good locations opened in former Boloco spaces; Stone L'Oven Pizza Co. opened a third location; Somerville's Painted Burro spawned a little sibling in Brookline, Burro Bar; the Roxy's Grilled Cheese and Area Four teams collaborated to create Roxy's Central / A4cade; the Catalyst Restaurant team opened Catalyst Cafe nearby; and there were two Vietnamese restaurant expansions between Quincy and Boston — Pho Countryside expanded from Quincy to Kenmore Square, and Pho Pasteur expanded from Chinatown to Quincy. \nMeanwhile, seven out-of-state chains have expanded to Boston so far this season: Philadelphia's City Tap House, now open in Fort Point; Philly Pretzel Company, with its first Massachusetts location now open in Revere; By Chloe, now open in the Seaport District; Tilted Kilt, a \"breastaurant\" that has invaded Fenway; Caffe Nero, a European coffee chain that has been opening up a ton of Boston-area locations, most recently in Brookline's Washington Square; Florida-based Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza, which now has five Massachusetts locations; and Ruth's Chris Steak House, now open in Waltham. \nConnecticut's Love Art Sushi and New Hampshire's Fat Biscuit both expanded here as well, but the Boston-area openings are only the second locations for each company. \nA few restaurants popped up from first-time owners, too, including Manoa Poke Shop, Pagu, and Bistro Duet. \nSomething missing? This map will be updated frequently throughout winter 2017 (originally published January 12, 2017; date of most recent update appears above). Note that restaurants are listed in alphabetical order, not ranked. 1 Aceituna Grill \nAfter more than a decade serving up Mediterranean food in Cambridge's Kendall Square, Aceituna Grill has expanded across the river to the Seaport District, bringing fast-casual pita roll-ups, tabbouleh, and more to the busy lunch crowds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:40:07.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
