According to K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune , general manager Gar Forman and executive vice president John Paxson will be retained, even if the team misses the playoffs. Chicago entered Tuesday with a 26-26 record, good enough for seventh place in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls made several notable moves last offseason, including trading away Derrick Rose as well as acquiring Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo. Despite this aggressiveness, the squad is in danger of missing the playoffs for the second season in a row. This is in addition to chemistry problems between the players with Wade and Butler calling out their teammates' effort , plus a lack of trust in the front office among the players, according to the Chicago Sun-Times ' Joe Cowley .

The next step is figuring out how to turn the current roster in to a championship contender.
