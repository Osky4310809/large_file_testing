Through earning a college degree while working a full-time job in the military and being a single mother, I learned anything is possible. My favorite Sunday afternoon includes rollerblading while my kids ride their bikes. \nWorkout Routine \nI work out four days a week and do yoga daily, which allows me to focus on stretching, and it puts me in a positive state of mind. My training consists of HIIT cardio , TRX training, or plyometric workouts like jump squats, jump lunges, burpees, etc. My workouts do not last longer than 45 minutes, including warmup and cooldown. With this balance, I look and feel 100 times better now than I did two years ago! \nMother of 4; Mississauga, Ontario, Canada \nKarate Kids \nMy kids are no strangers to the gym. My three oldest boys are really into karate, while the youngest follows along. I come from a boxing/kickboxing background, so I love watching my boys doing karate. I appreciate the structure and discipline involved in martial arts. \nBeautiful Game \nI love to play soccer with my kids. There’s nothing better than running in an open field in the fresh air and listening to their laughter. \nWorkout Routine \nI tend to focus on one muscle group per workout and incorporate plyometric exercises for added intensity. \nFAVORITE POWER-PLYO WORKOUT \n60 seconds each exercise, no rest in between moves. Rest 60 seconds between circuits. Repeat circuit 3–4 times. MOUNTAIN CLIMBER \nMother of 3; Phoenix, AZ \nLeading by Example \nMy children are all very active—they do gymnastics, softball, soccer, and football. They see my husband and I make healthy eating and exercise a prominent part of our lives, and watching this trickle over into their own preferences is extremely rewarding. During times of inactivity or breaks from sports, they’ve asked me to put them through a rigorous HIIT body-weight workout. They love it! \nNever Take No for an Answer \nIf there’s one thing to fuel my fire, it’s a good challenge. There are no longer any solidly defined lines of what a woman can and cannot be. Because I believe a happy mom is a good mom, I have no guilt when working fitness into my already hectic schedule. \nWorkout Routine \nI typically do a four- or five-day split workout each week. I do fasted cardio three to five times per week and alternate between HIIT and steady state. I do no longer than 20 to 30 minutes per session. Monday is usually anterior leg day, and I mix up sets and reps frequently to maximize my efficiency. Plus, I often use one or two of these training methods: high-rep (sets of 20–30), dropsets (15, 12, 10, 10, 8), German Volume Training (10 sets of 10). Also, I may do lunge jumps or sumo squat jumps between sets.
