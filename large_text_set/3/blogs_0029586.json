This weekend, the bill’s sponsor, Tim Kraayenbrink, defended his decision, according to the Fort Dodge Messenger : \nThe Republican from Fort Dodge said the school will close without the exemption. \n“ They deserve to stay open and serve these children ,” he said. “ I will not change my mind on this .” \nWhat Kraayenbrink did not say is that Anchor Character Training Center (ACTC) should have closed years ago. Image: Pixabay . Public domain. \nFor many years, Harvest Baptist Church operated ACTC without any state licence. In 2009, it harboured a 16-year-old sex offender who had been convicted outside the state, possibly in violation of sex offender registry laws (the county attorney did not prosecute because no one brought a case). \nThe facility opened in 1996. By 2009, according to County Sheriff Brian Mickelson, twenty-four young people had run away from the facility. This is from the a residential school with a capacity of only about 35 students at a time. Young people with nowhere to go do not run away from places where they are safe. \nIn the same period, according to the Sheriff, there was also one allegation of child endangerment and one case of criminal mischief, although no charges were brought. \nAccording to Fornits Wiki , which gives information on Troubled Teen homes, former students have reported corporal punishment was used at ACTC. There is evidence linking ACTC to other homes where abuse has been confirmed ( link 1 , link 2 , link 3 ,). \nThe bill before the Iowa House now will require Anchor Character Training Center to be subject to inspections. The Republicans backing this bill say that this means that the safety of the residents is guaranteed. I say that this depends on how good Anchor staff are at hiding the abuse. \nThis ACTC newsletter (which appears to be from 2013) shows that they censored incoming and outgoing communication between children in the facility and their parents: \nWe have just a short time with so many of the residents at the home, please do not interfere with the program. You can help us in the following ways: \n1. Do not participate in handling mail for the residents. \n2. Do not make promises to the residents without prior permission by staff of the ACTC. \n3. Do not come to the home to visit residents without prior permission by the staff of the ACTC. \n4. Do not give gifts or money to the residents without going through the staff of the ACTC. \n5. Do not provide transportation to the residents without going through the staff of the ACTC. \n6. Do not provide phone contact for the residents. Phone calls are allowed only through the ACTC office. \nWe have seen this pattern of censorship and isolation before from similar places . \nIn this YouTube video, a former student accuses the Pastor of Harvest Baptist Church, which owns and runs ACTC, of covering up a rape at “his school”. \nMarvin Smith, Pastor of Harvest Baptist Church in Fort Dodge, Iowa. Do you remember hiding the rape at your school by a man named Rick Durbin? \nAccording to the church website, the church also operates another school, Harvest Baptist School, so it is not clear whether this woman’s allegations relate to ACTC. But either way it should be of concern that these allegations relate to people in a position of power over ACTC. \nIf you’ve been reading this blog for any length of time, you’ll understand: Anchor Character Training Center is a Roloff home without Lester Roloff’s name on it (HEAL online, a group for survivors of abusive homes, agrees ). According to HEAL, it is affiliated with Hephzibah House, the site of a shocking ABC News investigation: \nEven if we assume that abuse is a thing of the past at ACTC, however, the fact remains that it supplies an inadequate education . In this video, State Representative Mary Mascher (D-Iowa City) describes how students from ACTC applying to Iowa State University have been rejected because the university considers them unprepared: \nIowa’s legislators want to keep ACTC open even though it can’t meet the conditions for state accreditation. They must not be allowed to do so. Like Leaving Fundamentalism and Patheos Atheist on Facebook!
