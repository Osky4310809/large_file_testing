Mike Huckabee’s known advocacy for smaller government, he believes one federal agency that would lose funding under the Trump administration’s new budget proposal deserves a second look. \nIn an op-ed published in The Washington Post, Huckabee, identified also as an “amateur musician,” states the case for sparing the National Endowment for the Arts from the budget axe. \n“No doubt a chainsaw seems more appropriate to the task at hand than a carving knife, but I would urge my president and friend to hold back from one tiny area of the budget whose elimination would cost far more than it would save,” Huckabee wrote.

It's about the kids like me who grew up poor, but deserve access to music. \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) March 23, 2017 @dwhfarmall That kind of crap ended in the 90's when Newt led the GOP budget. That is NOT what is funded now. Please read my full column \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) March 23, 2017 \nIn his column, Huckabee marshaled two main arguments in favor of the NEA. He contended that arts are not an extra, but an essential in the lives of young people.

Huckabee said 40 percent of the NEA’s funding goes to states and communities that then select the local artists. \n“Many children get their only access to music and the arts via grants made by the NEA — 40 percent of which go to high-poverty neighborhoods, while 36 percent reach underserved people, such as veterans and those with disabilities,” he wrote. \nHuckabee said there is a difference between NEA funding and government waste. \n“I truly want the government to stop wasting my tax money. I want it to stop funding things that don’t work and things that get funded only because they are some congressman’s pet project or have a powerful lobby behind them. To some, it may seem as though the $147.9 million allocated to the NEA in fiscal 2016 is money to be saved,” he wrote. “But to someone such as me — for whom an early interest in music and the arts became a lifeline to an education and academic success — this money is not expendable, extracurricular or extraneous. It is essential.” \n“I’m for cutting waste and killing worthless programs. I’m not for cutting and killing the hope and help that come from creativity,” he added. What do you think?
