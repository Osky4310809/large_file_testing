Paul LePage may be an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, but even he thinks it's time for the President to move on from the antics of his reality show days. \nLePage told Newsradio WGAN Thursday that he thinks that Trump should be told the \"TV show's over\" and stop treating what he sees as a power struggle among Trump's top aides as a reality show competition. CNN reported on the remarks Thursday evening. \nLePage told the station he is concerned there are too many cooks in the kitchen among Trump's aides and that the President needs to assert authority among top aides Kellyanne Conway, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Steve Bannon \n\"The thing I'm sensing is that there's three or four chiefs at the top,\" LePage said. \n\"I would say this: You've got to put someone somebody in charge,\" LePage continued. \"Somebody's gotta be in charge. You're the President.\" \nThe Maine governor told WGAN that he thinks Trump encourages competition, but that may be backfiring when it comes to his aides and what he sees as their struggle for power and fight to be in Trump's favor. \n\"In his case, too much competition. Everybody's fighting to be that number one person. You're gonna have a lot of slip ups,\" LePage said. \"I've met Donald Trump, I think he does promote some competition. He brings that business aspect to it. We got to tell him that the TV show's over and he's gotta move on now.\" \nLePage said that he encourages Trump to let Vice President Mike Pence or Priebus take the reins. \n\"I think he needs Reince Priebus and Pence, Vice President Pence, are good people, and if he goes through Pence he's going to have somebody that he's very qualified, he understands the Congress, he understands how it works in Washington,\" LePage said. \"He can help Donald Trump get his message out. He can be very, very helpful.\" \nListen below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:27:55.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
