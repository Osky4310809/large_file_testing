It was going viral. Just within a few hours, they had banned me again and they were going to make it more painful.” \nAccording to Facebook’s community standards , Johnston’s post was deemed as “hate speech.” \nThe standards state that Facebook removes “hate speech,” including content “content that directly attacks people” based on: race; ethnicity; national origin; religious affiliation; sexual orientation; sex; gender; or gender identity; or serious disabilities or diseases. \nIf Johnston’s Bible quote is hate speech, what about the terrorists who use social media to promote their propaganda and are allowed a platform? It seems as if those are the people Facebook should target instead. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and tell us if you think Facebook was censoring Johnston.
