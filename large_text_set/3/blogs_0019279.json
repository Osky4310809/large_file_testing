Courtesy of Tony Robbins.\nCan the secret to happiness really be boiled down to a single word?\nIn his latest book, \" Unshakeable ,\" Tony Robbins professes, \"In fact, I can tell you the secret to happiness in one word: progress.\"\nAs I wrote about in a previous article, the art of fulfillment is Tony Robbins' greatest obsession today . This is because Tony Robbins believes that, \" Success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure .\"\nIn order to achieve the art of fulfillment, Tony Robbins advocates that the first step is that you must keep growing! This is why he believes that the secret to happiness is progress. And he's not the only one who believes this.\nIn Tony Hsieh's book, \" Delivering Happiness ,\" he also spends a great deal of time on the topic of progress. Have you ever achieved a goal you've been working so hard for only to find emptiness when you thought you would feel fulfillment? That's because true happiness is less about reaching your goal and more about making progress in all the areas of your life that are truly important to you.\nHaving money won't make you rich In \" Unshakeable ,\" Tony Robbins outlines the core principles of how to retire rich . But I SO appreciate that he doesn't just stop there. Having more money in and of itself will not bring you happiness. And there's nothing worse than a miserable rich person, is there?\n\"Money doesn't change people,\" says Tony Robbins. \"It just magnifies who they already are: if you have a lot of money and you're mean, then you have more to be mean with; if you have a lot of money and you're generous, you'll naturally give more.\"\nMaking progress in all areas of your life As entrepreneurs, we tend to focus a bit myopically. When starting a business, we tend to give it everything we've got. And so when Tony Robbins talks about making progress, it's not just about making progress in your business and your financial wealth. Making progress in multiple facets in your life is about designing your life, versus being a manager of your circumstances .\nTrue happiness comes from progressing in all facets in your life; from your health to your family and from your relationships to your contributions. When you examine your life as a whole, the more progress you make toward the man or woman you wish to become, the more happy and fulfilled you will be.\n\"I designed the man you see before you,\" Tony Robbins often says during his seminars. \"This didn't just happen. I designed the man I wanted to become.\"\nThe takeaway My takeaway here is that if you're not happy with the way your life has turned out thus far, you always have the power to change who you are and who you want to become — in all facets of your life. That is why the art of fulfillment is Tony Robbins' greatest obsession today.\nRead the original article on Inc. . Copyright 2017.
