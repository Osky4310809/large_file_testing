In this current political climate, this sponsor raised some questions on social media. As President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning immigrants from certain Middle Eastern countries, social media users took notice of the advertising from Turkish Airlines. \nTurkish Airlines is the national flag carrier airline of Turkey. As of July 2015, it operates scheduled services to 290 destinations in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, making it the fourth-largest carrier in the world by number of destinations, as of 2014. It serves more destinations non-stop from a single airport than any other airline in Europe. Turkish Airlines flies to 115 countries, more than any other airline. \nWith an operational fleet of ten cargo aircraft, the airline’s cargo division serves 52 destinations. Istanbul Atatürk Airport is its main base, and there are secondary hubs at Esenboğa International Airport, Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, and Adnan Menderes Airport. Turkish Airlines has been a member of the Star Alliance network since 1 April 2008.\nHere are some reactions to people discussing Turkish Airlines’ Super Bowl sponsorship.\nWhy is the Super Bowl pre game on Fox sponsored by Turkish airlines?
