He was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. (WBZ-TV) \nTetradze, a Russian translator, says he was leaving the West Newton Cinema where he saw the film “Things To Come” and they did. \n“He didn’t say anything coherent, he was yelling things and mostly growling and roaring,” Tetradze said. \nWitness Eddie Tong says the knife was at least ten inches long and he heard Kirby yelling, “I did it, I did it”. \nAccording to the police report Kirby said he “just snapped”. \nTetradze feels fortunate the chance encounter didn’t turn even more violent. “I feel really lucky he didn’t slash my throat, stab me in the heart or my eye or whatever,” he said. “He could have done anything.” \nTetradze says even in pain he’s feeling sympathy for Chad Kirby. “I feel really sorry for him, he obviously needs help,” he said.
