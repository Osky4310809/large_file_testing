We get bored at the same speed at which we fall in love, and we end up struggling to keep the things fun and interesting instead of enjoying the perks of a long-term relationship. While you need to approach the problem together as a couple, there are certain boosters you can use to uplift your mood, and get that spark ignited in the relationship. If you are feeling the monotony set it, try these quick fixes to bring those butterflies back. 1. Pick up the phone and send a text \nLook at your text history this very minute. Romance often gives way to practicality, and if your last text to your S.O. was about asking them to get milk on their way back home, you totally need to shake things up a little! Send your partner a cute text about something they did this morning that you loved, or maybe send across an old picture of the two of you to bring back old memories. Doing things out of the ordinarily is a great way to bring back the fun, and you don't really need to start big. Just send a fun text... right now!! 2. Make interesting dinner plans \nIf you both enjoy going out, book a nice place for a seven-course meal. If you are more of the pizza in PJs kinda couple, find an interesting movie to stream tonight, buy a bottle of wine, and head home earlier than you usually do to set up the sofa. Whatever you do, don't have your regular boring dinner. 3. Skip the social media scrolling, and head to the balcony instead \nHow do you normally wind down after a long hard day at work? Check your phone, watch a video, chat with your bestie? Skip all that. Grab your partner, and head to the balcony with a bottle of wine, and while sipping it look out at the stars with soft music playing on your phone... it doesn't get more romantic than this. 4. Spice things up in the bedroom \nDon't follow any set sexy-time routine, tonight. If you feel like putting on some music and dancing before you hit the sack, do it. Don't think too much, simply follow your instinct. Let your inner sexy beast out! 5. Wake up early, and make about a good breakfast \nIs there something that your partner has been craving for breakfast for a while? If there is a new breakfast place you both are dying to try out, head there today and stop worrying about it being a weekday. Wake up earlier than usual, and use that time to have the best breakfast ever, because why not! 6. Hug and deep kiss before heading out \nIt's surprising the way we cease to show affection the moment we get comfortable in a relationship. Hug your partner instinctively, give them a kiss in the lift, and hold hands till you reach the car. It might be cheesy but it is the best mood booster.
