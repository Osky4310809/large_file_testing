Techcrunch has confirmed with sources close to the company that it is now valued at $31 billion. \nAirbnb turned profitable in the second half of 2016 and anticipates that it will be profitable in 2017 on an Ebitda basis, the source tells us. \nThe company — which started as a marketplace for people with spare beds to connect with travellers who needed a place to stay but didn’t want or couldn’t afford a hotel — has expanded massively with a huge global network not just of spare beds but whole homes covering all budgets, as well as a new line of “ experiences ” that take the company beyond accommodation into events that let users “experience a city like a local”. It also also moved into an end-to-end experience by also letting users book their travel through the Airbnb platform. \nThe company has been tipped as one of the outsized tech startups that would go public this year, although this latest round gives it a lot more runway as a private company. Our source tells us that Airbnb has “no plans to go public anytime soon.” \nMore to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T18:22:48.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
