Putin? Updated: February 5, 2017 — 6:18 PM EST 539 Share @phillysport \nThe Flyers alumni will play three games in Russia as part of an upcoming goodwill tour, and one of the opposing teams may feature…..Russia President Vladimir Putin? \nFormer Flyers defenseman Joe Watson, who will play in the games, confirmed to the Courier-Post that Putin “wants to play against us,” but that his schedule won’t be released until 24 hours prior to the game because of security reasons. \nNo word on if Donald Trump will play for the Orange and Black. \nLast week, with rumors swirling that the 64-year-old Putin would play for Russia, former Flyers defenseman Brad Marsh, the president of the team’s alumni association, told The Inquirer he had “no idea” if Putin would suit up. Poll Which Philadelphia team will be the next to play for a title? Eagles Results \nPutin has a background as a hockey player and has performed well in exhibition games. \nThe Flyers’ alumni will play games in Kazan (Feb. 16), Saint Petersburg (Feb. 18), and Moscow’s Red Square (Feb. 20). The latter game will be held outdoors. \nAmong the former Flyers who are playing: Watson, Marsh, Terry Carkner, Jeff Chychrun, Shjon Podein, Lindsay Carson, and Al Secord. Chase Watson, the son of former Flyer Jimmy Watson, will also compete. \nSeveral Russians who played for the Flyers may also play, including Dmitri Yushkevich, Danny Markov, and Alexei Zhamnov. \nFreddy Cassivi, who played for Washington and Atlanta in the NHL and with Hershey (and others) in the AHL, will be the Flyers' goalie. \nThe Flyers have name recognition in Russia. They defeated the Russian Red Army, 4-1, at the Spectrum in a famous 1976 game. In that game, the Russians left the ice after Ed Van Impe delivered a hard check on Valeri Kharlamov. \nVan Impe later deadpanned he didn’t know what all the fuss was about because Kharlamov ran into his elbow. \nThe Russians returned to the ice when Flyers owner Ed Snider threatened not to pay them for their appearance. \nJoe Watson is the only Flyers player who will make the trip to Russia who played in that Jan. 11, 1976 game. The Red Army had been undefeated on the tour before losing to the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Flyers. \nBreakaways. Though coach Dave Hakstol said he was undecided about his lineup for Monday’s game against visiting St. Louis, Travis Konecny and Shayne Gostisbehere stayed on the ice after their teammates left at Sunday’s practice, which is usually a sign they will be benched again….The Flyers have allowed a total of two goals over their last two games Michal Neuvirth will make his third straight start Monday....Excluding an empty-netter, the Flyers have managed only 11 goals over their last eight games, an average of 1.4 goals per contest.
