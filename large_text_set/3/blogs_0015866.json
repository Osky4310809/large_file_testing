Fraud: The model in her police mugshot (Met Police) \nWhen the tenancy of the property had been secured, Moorcroft changed her name by deed poll to that of the genuine owner of the property, who was deceased. \nShe then travelled to Dubai where she opened bank accounts - using a new UK passport - in the dead woman's name, Scotland Yard said. \nAfter that she made her way back to London where she successfully applied for a £1.2 million loan against the property. Laylah De Cruz: The model has been jailed \nThe loan was approved in October 2014 and the funds transferred to Moorcroft's Dubai bank accounts, from where they were later withdrawn in cash. \nDetectives launched an investigation later that month after the Land Registry reported suspicious activity around the Kensington property. \nProsecutor Teresa Hay said during the trial: “The fraud was as simple as it was audacious. Dianne Moorcroft changed her name by deed poll in summer 2014 solely for the purpose of participating in this fraud. \n“She was encouraged and supported in the endeavour by her daughter Laylah De Cruz.” \nMoorcroft was arrested in February 2015 at her home and De Cruz was arrested as she entered the UK from Dubai in May last year. \nThe proceeds of the fraud have never been recovered. The road in Kensington where the home is located (Nigel Howard) \nDetective Constable Richard Kirk, of the Met, said: \"As these women conducted this devious fraud, it is clear that it didn't occur to them that official agencies would be able to see through their scheme and this was their undoing. \n\"Although the wider investigation to trace additional members of the network is ongoing, it is clear that De Cruz and Moorcroft played key roles in the execution of this crime.
