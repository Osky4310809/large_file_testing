It looks like Girl Meets World has officially been canceled by the Disney Channel, after completing three seasons. Three episodes are left to air, with the finale, titled “Girl Meets Goodbye,” set to air on January 20th.\nWe’ve been sadly prepping for this news for a bit. Just recently, actor and director Rider Strong hinted that the end was near . While we definitely wanted to believe the guy who we know best as Shawn Hunter, we also hoped for a miracle. Three seasons just seems a little short . We wanted to see the Girl Meets World kids graduate, and this season only saw them enter Abigail Adams High School!\nFingers crossed that we get a TV special, or some kind of reunion, in a few years. Riley Matthews is a pretty amazing character, and we’d love to see where the daughter of Topanga and Cory — our favorite childhood couple — ends up.\nThese tweets from the Girl Meets World writing team are heartbreaking: It is with incredible pride in our work and complete sadness that things end, that I report to this wonderful audience that our show is over\n— Girl Meets Writers (@GMWWriters) January 5, 2017 I just officially got the call, and would like to thank this audience for its incredible love and loyalty. Please watch our January episodes\n— Girl Meets Writers (@GMWWriters) January 5, 2017 We leave you with three incredible souvenirs of a show we couldn't be more proud of. As I look back I can tell you with absolute certainty -\n— Girl Meets Writers (@GMWWriters) January 5, 2017 We gave you our best.\n— Girl Meets Writers (@GMWWriters) January 5, 2017 Rowan Blanchard, the young actress who brought Riley to life , also posted an incredible message on her Instagram account. It’s obvious that she’s a bit distraught over the news — and, that just proves how close the cast and crew were.\nA photo posted by Rowan Blanchard (@rowanblanchard) on Jan 4, 2017 at 8:42pm PST \nSabrina Carpenter, who played Maya Hart, also gave a short tribute to the show .\nThere is no end. There is no beginning. There is only the infinite passion of life. - Fellini #GirlMeetsWorld pic.twitter.com/TWGAMgEQhS \n— Sabrina Carpenter (@SabrinaAnnLynn) January 5, 2017 We know these talented young actresses will find a new show to call home soon. For now, we’ll be setting our calendars to watch these last three episodes. And of course, we’ll never forget the Matthews family.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T17:23:03.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
