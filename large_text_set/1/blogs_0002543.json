Then, the vicious killings of Leno and Rosemary La Bianca in their Los Feliz residence, which is still standing to this day.\nThe Tate residence has since been destroyed and reportedly replaced with another home.\nAfter the murders, Manson claimed that he had been trying to start a race war in the name of “Helter Skelter,” a song written by The Beatles.\nBut Vincent Bugliosi — who served as the prosecutor in the 1970 trial of Manson — later wrote in his true crime book, of the same name, that the madman had partly been seeking revenge against the Hollywood establishment on the night of Tate and her friends were murdered.\nManson allegedly tried to set up a record contract with Beach Boys producer Terry Melcher in the days before the killings, but the deal had fallen apart.\nAngry about being rejected, he returned to his home — 10050 Cielo Drive to confront him — only to find out that Melcher had moved out and that Polanski and Tate had moved in.\nManson and his followers were all convicted for both the Tate and La Bianca slayings and initially given the death penalty, though their sentences were eventually commuted to life with the possibility of parole after the death penalty was abolished in California.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T01:38:01.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
