His name in Hebrew means \" father of a multitude.\" Originally called Abram, or \"exalted father,\" the Lord changed his name to Abraham as a symbol of the covenant promise to multiply his descendants into a great nation that God would call his own. \nPrior to this, God had already visited Abraham when he was 75, promising to bless him and make his offspring into an abundant nation of people. All Abraham had to do was obey God and do what God told him to do. God's Covenant with Abraham \nThis marked the beginning of the covenant God established with Abraham. It was also Abraham's first test from God, since he and his wife Sarai (later changed to Sarah) were still without children. Abraham demonstrated remarkable faith and trust, immediately leaving his home and his clan the moment God called him to the unknown territory of Canaan. \nAccompanied by his wife and nephew Lot , Abraham prospered as a rancher and shepherd, as he made his new home surrounded by pagans in the Promised Land of Canaan. Still childless, however, Abraham's faith wavered in subsequent times of testing. \nWhen famine struck, rather than waiting on God for provision, he packed up and took his family to Egypt. \nOnce there, and fearing for his life, he lied about his beautiful wife's identity, claiming she was his unmarried sister. Pharaoh, finding Sarah desirable, took her from Abraham in exchange for generous gifts, to which Abraham raised no objections. You see, as a brother, Abraham would be honored by Pharaoh, but as a husband, his life would have been in danger. Once again, Abraham lost faith in God's protection and provision. Abraham's foolish deception backfired, and God kept his covenant promise intact. \nThe Lord inflicted disease on Pharaoh and his family, revealing to him that Sarah must be returned to Abraham untouched. \nMore years passed during which Abraham and Sarah questioned God's promise. At one point, they decided to take matters into their own hands. At Sarah's encouragement, Abraham slept with Hagar, his wife's Egyptian maidservant. Hagar gave birth to Ishmael , but he was not the promised son. God returned to Abraham when he was 99 to remind him of the promise and reinforce his covenant with Abraham. A year later, Isaac was born. \nGod brought more tests to Abraham, including a second incident when Abraham lied about Sarah's identity, this time to King Abimelech. But Abraham underwent the biggest testing of his faith when God asked him to sacrifice Isaac , the promised heir, in Genesis 22: \"Take your son, your only son—yes, Isaac, whom you love so much—and go to the land of Moriah. Go and sacrifice him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.\" \nThis time Abraham obeyed, fully prepared to slay his son, while fully trusting God to either resurrect Isaac from the dead ( Hebrews 11:17-19 ), or provide a substitutionary sacrifice. At the last minute, God intervened and provided the necessary ram. \nThe death of Isaac would have contradicted every promise God had made to Abraham, so his willingness to perform the ultimate sacrifice of killing his son is probably the most strikingly dramatic example of faith and trust in God found in the entire Bible. Abraham's Accomplishments: \nAbraham is the great patriarch of Israel, and to New Testament believers, \"He is the father of us all (Romans 4:16).\" The faith of Abraham pleased God . \nGod visited Abraham on several unique occasions. The Lord spoke to him numerous times, once in a vision and once in the form of three visitors. Scholars believe that the mysterious \"King of Peace\" or \"King of Righteousness,\" Melchizedek , who blessed Abram and to whom Abram gave a tithe , may have been a theophany of Christ (a manifestation of deity). \nAbraham carried out a brave rescue of Lot when his nephew was taken captive after the Battle of the Valley of Siddim. Abraham's Strengths: \nGod tested Abraham severely in more than one instance, and Abraham demonstrated extraordinary faith, trust and obedience to the will of God. He was well-respected and successful in his occupation. He also had courage to face a powerful enemy coalition. Abraham's Weaknesses: \nImpatience, fear, and a tendency to lie under pressure were a few of Abraham's weaknesses revealed in the biblical account of his life. Life Lessons: \nOne crucial lesson we learn from Abraham is that God can and will use us in spite of our weaknesses. God will even stand by us and rescue us from our foolish mistakes. The Lord is greatly pleased by our faith and willingness to obey him. \nLike most of us, Abraham came to the full realization of God's purpose and promise only over a long period of time and a process of revelation. Thus, we learn from him that God's calling will usually come to us in stages. Hometown: \nAbraham was born in the city of Ur of the Chaldeans (present day Iraq). He traveled 500 miles to Haran (now southeast Turkey) with his family and stayed there until his father's death. When God called Abraham, he moved 400 miles south to the land of Canaan and lived there most of the rest of his days. Referenced in the Bible: \nGenesis 11-25; Exodus 2:24; Acts 7:2-8; Romans 4; Galatians 3; Hebrews 2, 6, 7, 11. Occupation: \nAs head of a semi-nomadic clan of herdsmen, Abraham became a successful and prosperous rancher and shepherd, raising livestock and farming the land.
