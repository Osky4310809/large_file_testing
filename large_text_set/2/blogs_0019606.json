When Donald and Melania Trump came to town, he made sure he went. Later, he described it on Facebook : \nA few days ago, people across the United States heard the news that our newly elected President would be visiting Melbourne, Florida – our hometown. It is no surprise to many that I do not support many of the objectives and “campaignisms” of Donald Trump. I know many people who voted for him – friends, family, church people who all voted for their own reasons. The point of this experience is not to relay all of the reasons why I think he should not be the president. Those points are moot – he IS our President. \nNow, I am enough of a sentimentalist that when I found out THEEEE President was coming to town, I got online quickly and reserved two tickets. \nBut the pastor, who admitted he wasn’t a fan of Donald Trump, was bothered by what he saw. \nMusic was playing loudly throughout the venue as it filled up with hundreds of people…. “God bless the USA!” in an earlier post…it was almost church-like. People sang along, raising their hands and were emotionally moved by this anthem. \nPeople were being ushered into a deeply religious experience…and it made me completely uncomfortable. \nThen he wrote: \nA couple of local politicians got up to bring greetings followed by state representative, followed by one of our Congress representatives. A soloist sang, “God bless America” and there was a strong sense of patriotism in the room. A pastor got up to pray and repeatedly prayed throughout his prayer, “Thank you for making this the greatest nation on earth…in Jesus’ name.” \nUh-uh. No. No way, josé. \nOh man. I’m so glad I don’t go to this guy’s church. Then angry anti-Trump protestors got in his face and screamed, causing his daughter to cry. \nThe two angry, screaming ladies looked at me, both of them raised their middle finger at me in my face and repeatedly yelled, “F*#% YOU!” Repeatedly. \nI calmly responded, “No thank you, I’m happily married.” Their faces and their voices were filled with demonic anger. \nI have been in places and experiences before where demonic activity was palpable. The power of the Holy Spirit of God was protecting me in those moments and was once again protecting me and my daughter in this moment. \nI raised my voice and calmly said, “These ladies have the right to do what they are doing and they are harming no one; this is America and they a right to express themselves in this way. They are harming no one.” A couple of other people around me stepped in and supported me in protecting them as a barrier, as well. \nHe continued: \nNow, not everyone in the room was a part of the angry mob mentality – I looked around the room and saw many people who could quite easily be folks from my neighborhood, folks from my church, folks who were planning to go grab a bite to eat at Cracker Barrel afterwards. Folks who truly wanted to see America “great.” The people who support the Republican Party want to see some needed changes in the government – the people that were there for that reason, are by and large good folks. But those are not the people the President was inciting – they are not the people he was leading. He was rallying the angry, vigilant ones. \nWhat she WILL remember is the angry, violent man screaming demonic vitriol at a child and her mother. She will remember the two ladies screaming at her Dad, her pastor – flipping the middle finger and using the F word repeatedly. \nOkay, so it sounds like the guy had a pretty horrible experience. Whatever. But the thing that’s really troublesome is that this (l ng) Facebook rant ended up in the Washington Post! What? Since when did the Washington Post care one BIT about religion? \nThis tweet really summed it up: 2013: “What?? Scalia said he believes in the Devil????” \n2017: “We need to talk about the demonic influences at Trump rallies.” \nTruth Revolt has the last word: \nHere’s the very sad truth: if you’re a Christian, you’re marginalized, mocked, and labeled a bigot. But when an evangelical says the first cross word about Donald Trump, the most dangerous place in the world to be is between him and the reporters rushing to get a microphone in front of his face.
