Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLen McCluskey's rival for the Unite leadership says ending free movement from the EU is “non-negotiable” in Brexit talks. \nGerard Coyne, who is challenging Mr McCluskey to become general secretary of Britain's biggest union, calls on Theresa May not to “waste time” by failing to set out her plans. \nSpeaking in Birmingham on Monday, he will say workers who backed Leave will feel betrayed if unlimited migration from the continent continues. \n“My many conversations with Unite members leave me in no doubt that those who voted for Brexit expect that promise of an end to uncontrolled immigration from the EU to be kept, and will feel betrayed if it is not,” Mr Coyne will say. \n“For the many Britons facing insecurity in the job market, who rely on public services such as the NHS and state schools, and who need affordable homes, the presence of a very large number of foreign nationals has added to the pressures they already face at a time of austerity.\" Len McCluskey has led Unite since 2011 (Photo: Rwendland) \nMrs May is expected to outline parts of her Brexit strategy later this month. \nBut she has refused to give “a running commentary”. \nFormal talks will start after she triggers Article 50 , due before the end of March. \n\"If there is an issue on which you are not prepared to negotiate, it is sensible, and courteous, to say so before talks begin. Not to do so wastes time and needlessly antagonises the other side,” Mr Coyne will say. \n“Theresa May and other ministers should not wait until Article 50 has been triggered to set out a negotiating position on free movement of labour. Migration from the EU will be a key issue in Brexit talks (Photo: Getty) \n“They should be saying now, without equivocation, that the issue is non-negotiable. \n“There can be no compromise on the principle of taking back control of our borders.” \nShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer yesterday said that within Labour \"there is a consensus that when we leave the EU the immigration regime will have to change\". \n\"There should be a fundamental rethink of immigration rules from start to finish,\" he told the Sunday Times. \n\"The rules on free movement have got to be changed or the way the rules operate has got to change.\" \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly ruled out ending free movement from the EU.
