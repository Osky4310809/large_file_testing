Indiana would look like this. \nJames Blackmon Jr. scored 23 points, and a Crean-coached IU team defeated a higher-seeded opponent in the Big Ten tournament for the first time in a 95-73 win over Iowa on Thursday night. The No. 10 seed Hoosiers (18-14) will face No. 2 seed Wisconsin at 6:30 p.m. Friday. \n“It was never a question that we were not a good shooting team,” Crean said. “As long as the ball is moving and we’re ready to shoot, and we’re playing through the paint or the post, that’s when good things happen.” \nA competitive game for 23 minutes devolved steadily into a rout over the last 17. \nNo. 7 seed Iowa arrived in Washington, D.C., trying to sew up an at-large NCAA tournament berth that appeared impossible before the Hawkeyes won four straight to close their regular season. Instead, Indiana made them look like also-rans, sweeping them aside in a manner the Hoosiers haven’t been able to replicate since the blowouts of late December. \nIt marked the first time Indiana has scored 95 or more points against back-to-back Big Ten opponents since late January/early February 1998. And it started where it often has in Crean’s tenure: behind the 3-point line. \n• BOX SCORE: Indiana 95, Iowa 73 \n“We were not connected defensively the way you need to be to defend Indiana,” Iowa coach Fran McCaffery said. “Our defense was not where it needed to be to compete with a team with that many weapons.” \nIn two sentences, McCaffery perfectly illustrated both the hope and the frustration IU fans could be forgiven for feeling about the Hoosiers' performance. \nIndiana’s problems, from turnovers to defense to fouls, have been well-documented this winter. Some of them predate this season. Some of them have been issues, at least to some extent, even during Crean’s best seasons in Bloomington. \nSo often, the Hoosiers have countered those problems with devastating offensive efficiency. And so often, that efficiency began behind the 3-point line. The ability to score in flurries, and then turn those flurries into all-out storms, was a hallmark of IU’s last two Big Ten title teams. CLOSE x Share IU freshman forward De'Ron Davis speaks with reporters following his team's Big Ten tournament win over Iowa on Thursday. Zach Osterman / IndyStar \nIt hasn’t been so for this group. Despite those “weapons” McCaffery referenced (even without injured forward OG Anunoby, Indiana has plenty), the Hoosiers have never been consistent from behind the 3-point line. They averaged just 37.6 percent from behind the arc entering the postseason, compared to 40.3 percent in 2013, and 41.6 percent last season. \nThus, Indiana’s offense hasn’t been itself. The court isn’t spaced as cleanly. Lanes don’t open. Drivers hit traffic. Turnovers are more difficult to avoid. \nProblems that weren’t problems Thursday night. \n“When we got up that run, when we got up 17, 20, it was glimpses of when Yogi (Ferrell) was out there passing the ball, and Troy (Williams) was out there running,” sophomore center Thomas Bryant said. “It felt good, and I know this team can do the same thing.” \nIt hasn’t been able to for most of this season, but quietly, the Hoosiers are beginning to resemble that group now.
