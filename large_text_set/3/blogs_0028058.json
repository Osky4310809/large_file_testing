Booker and Chriss were the only two regular Suns starters in the lineup as the team is going with younger players down the stretch. Jones, Len and Ulis have started only 33 games combined this season for a team that got blown out by the 15-win Nets. \nSo just how young was this starting five? According to ESPN, seven of the eight teams playing in Thursday night’s NCAA Sweet 16 games had older starting lineups than the one the Suns put on the floor. \nBe patient, Phoenix fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T17:26:11.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
