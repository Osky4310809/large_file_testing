They currently sit in England’s sixth division, competing in the National League North, and they’ve got a respectable three league titles and two league cups in their short existence. \nOn Sunday, they made another memory to add to the annals of their quickly expanding history book with an incredible comeback win from 2-0 down away from home against Gloucester City. Their winner was an 86th minute screamer from beyond midfield, one well worthy of either of the bigger Manchester clubs. Your Browser does not support iFrames. \nIt was a great strike, but what was the goalkeeper doing? \nThe Reds went into the half down by two, but they fought back, with Nathan Lowe halving the lead after 66 minutes with a beautiful chip. United missed a penalty that would’ve leveled the match, before Tom Greaves equalized four minutes from time. Just seconds later, Lowe launched his strike from midfield to spectacularly claim a victory for the Manchester upstarts. \nNot too bad from the little guys. Not too bad at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:44:08.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
