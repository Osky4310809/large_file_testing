Aaron Woods celebrates victory with fellow prop Tim Grant. Source: AAP \nDubbed the “big four”, Woods, Tedesco and Brooks are all Balmain juniors who attended Holy Cross College in Ryde, while Tedesco is a Campbelltown junior who over the last two seasons has established himself as one of the NRL’s elite fullbacks. \nTalk of a deal for Tedesco being done has been doing the rounds for the past month. All four players share the same agent, Isaac Moses, who refuses to comment on negotiations. \nAs one of the first players picked for NSW and the Australian Kangaroos, Woods, 25, has virtually carried the Wests Tigers forward pack single-handedly for the past three seasons. \nA Leichhardt Juniors junior, the deal is believed to be equivalent to Woods’ standing as a current international forward. \nLive stream the Wests Tigers’ round two clash with the Panthers on FOX SPORTS.
