Should they ever choose to sell the Glazers could be set for a big windfall (Photo: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images) \n“That would value United at just over £1bn but remember, when the Glazers bought United 11 years ago for £776m they paid 4.7 times the revenue at the time.” \nIf those principles were applied now, United would be valued between £2.5bn and £3bn. \nBut given they are an iconic global ­institution, the world’s money men believe there’s a strong case for believing United could well be worth £4bn – or more. \n“This is an industry with variables and it’s very hard to accurately make valuations,” says Bridge. “In United’s case their commercial deals set them apart from anyone else – even Barcelona and Real Madrid currently.” \nUnited’s commercial success defies logic. For even in years of decline they are making way more money than rivals who are more successful on the pitch. \nThe club have 70 partner sponsors – a roster even Real and Barca can’t compete with.
