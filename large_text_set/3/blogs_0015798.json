The Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the New York Times and author of The Power of Habit has made a name for himself plumbing the science of productivity, and this week he’s joining us on the podcast. \nListen above or find us in all the usual places where podcasts are served.

This Week’s Discussion \nCharles is, by any measure, a very productive person—he wrote a bestseller while working full-time and raising a family. And even though success begat success, he started to feel like he was treading water and didn’t want to come home every day after work to spend another five hours answering emails. Advertisement Advertisement \nSo he started calling researchers who study productivity as well as very productive people he admired to learn why some people manage to do so much while others struggle to reach the inbox zero promised land. Those phone calls and conversations are what led to his second book, Smarter Better Faster . \nIn today’s show we talk about many of the key principles Charles detailed in his book, including how pilots used ‘mental models’ to land a severely damaged airplane, how the worst automotive manufacturing plant in the country turned itself around when new owners gave the workers more control, and what it means to be truly productive.

Also he’s been considering the emotional drain of answering emails and has started thinking of each message as a suggestion instead of a command. That makes it easier to say no or ignore messages altogether. Melissa: Melissa’s been considering what her time is literally worth, and when it’s worth paying someone to do a time-consuming task instead of doing it yourself. As such, she’s been using Instacart instead of grocery shopping. Andy: I’ve been reclaiming my Saturdays as a safe-harbor for sloth. Yeah, being lazy on a Saturday isn’t reinventing the wheel but I always feel guilty when I don’t make any substantial use of my limited free time. Screw that. If I want to sleep in, order take-out, and watch Netflix for ten hours in my underwear, I will.
