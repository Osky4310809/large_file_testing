Walton County Sheriff Walton County Sheriff \nThe anonymous mother began her letter, \nIn this day, ‘cops’ are getting a bad rap. So, I wanted to say ‘thank you.’ \nYesterday, my daughter was one of the thousands of spoiled spring breakers ‘living it up’ on the beach. \nShe got arrested for underage drinking. She was holding a can of beer on the beach. A stupid move that I warned her about before she left, but I’m just her mother, so ‘in one ear and out the other.’ \nThe mother’s letter went on to say the experience of being arrested scared her daughter quite a bit, and she hopes she learned a valuable lesson from the whole ordeal. \nShe continued, \nThe reason that I am sending this is that every officer that I talked to or that I could hear in the back ground talking to her was so nice! Firm, but nice. \nI’m sure each one was rolling their eyes when my daughter said ‘Can you talk to my mom?,’ but each and every officer was respectful and assured me she would get back to her house safely.

We treat them fairly like we would treat anyone else. It’s nice to hear from a parent and hear their support. \nThe kindness the officers showed to the 19-year-old was reassuring, the mother said, as the two were separated by hundreds of miles, making it very easy to worry about what could go wrong. \nThe letter concluded, \nI know you all have to deal with this on a daily basis, which must be completely annoying and I’m very sorry my daughter added to your workload yesterday. \nThey say you always have one child that makes you go grey early and she is mine! Thank you for saving me a few more grey hairs last night.
