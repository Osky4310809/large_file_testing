That’s one thing Lindsey has yet to figure out. Though he admitted he’s not yet familiar with all of Auburn’s offensive personnel, the allure of coaching at a school in his home state and one at which he has experience was too much for Lindsey to turn down when Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn came calling. \n“I was so busy doing recruiting with us at Arizona State. We played at such a different time there on the West Coast so I didn't get to see a lot,” Lindsey said. “But I'm familiar with some of them just being from the state and knowing where a lot of these guys came from. I'm excited about what we have coming back for sure.” *** Get free breaking news in the Auburn Undercover newsletter *** \nThough he’s yet to become acquainted with all of Auburn’s returning playmakers, Lindsey built his career within the region. \nHe coached at seven Alabama and Georgia high schools before taking an analyst job on Auburn’s staff in 2013. He then spent two seasons as the offensive coordinator at Southern Miss before jumping to Arizona State as the offensive coordinator for a season. \nAlong with running the offense as a whole, Lindsey will be tasked with coaching Auburn’s quarterbacks and managing the upcoming competition for the starting job. Fortunately for him, that’s a position group he is familiar with upon his arrival. \nThe Tigers were pursuing Sean White , who has started 16 games over the past two seasons, when Lindsey worked as an analyst in Malzahn's first season at Auburn. He also knows transfer Jarrett Stidham , whom many presume as the favorite heading into spring, well after recruiting him at Arizona State. \nRedshirt freshman Woody Barrett and senior John Franklin III are also expected to play a role in the competition this spring. \n“Some familiarity with those guys,” Lindsey said, referring to White and Stidham. “Obviously, not on a day-to-day basis, but I’m looking forward to getting to know really all four of those guys that are here now. This spring is going to be fun.” \nStill with much to learn about Auburn’s personnel before the season opener against Georgia Southern on Sept. 2, Lindsey is ready to hit the ground running in his new role. \nThat will start immediately, as Auburn is hosting a bevy of prospects in its last major recruiting weekend before National Signing Day that Lindsey is tasked with meeting and building relationships with. \n“This is really a dream come true, growing up in this state, being around this state and college football, and my wife and her family had season tickets for 30 years,” Lindsey said. “Auburn’s been a special place to us, and obviously being here in 2013 with coach, getting that opportunity, but just extremely excited to get going. I’m ready to start right now, and as soon as we get done here—we just got in town—we’re going to get started on 2017.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T10:41:33.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
