They have a week to apologize and put a stop to their mistakes — and if they can’t do that, the city and district may be hit with a lawsuit. It shouldn’t have to come to that, but what other options are there when government officials think they’re above the law when it comes to pushing their faith on the community?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:35:38.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
