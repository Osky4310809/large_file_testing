The widespread engagement of the different groups in the Niger Delta region tells volumes of the willingness of this administration to genuinely develop the region. President Muhammadu Buhari \n“He opted for a political solution, which has brought peace to the region. I want to thank him for the release of some of the freedom fighters from detention, while also pleading for the release of the rest to ensure permanent peace that we all crave for. \n“The Buhari-led administration has performed well by doggedly fighting and defeating corruption to sanitize governance. This administration has also defeated Boko Haram and thereby, scored very high in maintaining peace and security. \n“I admire a great deal the commitment and passion demonstrated by Mr. President to salvage our nation from the hands of anti-people and cruel forces bent on continuing with corruption and other crimes against the people. Our President is very courageous and I commend him highly.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T03:35:52.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
