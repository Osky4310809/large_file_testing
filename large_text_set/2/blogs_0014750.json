Shutterstock/Gregory James Van Raalte \nThere's a global movement to encourage cities to grow more trees and plan more parks . But which ones have the most green space today? \nTo get a clearer picture, MIT's Senseable Lab partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to create Treepedia , a site with interactive maps that show the density of greenery in major cities around the world. \nThe researchers used information from Google Street View to determine what they call the \"Green View Index,\" a rating that quantifies each city's percentage of canopy coverage based on aerial images. When it launched in 2016, Treepedia featured 10 cities, but the team has since added five more to its list. \nThe goal of Treepedia is to make make urban planning more accessible to those outside the field, MIT's Carlo Ratti said in a press release. \nCheck out which cities boast the highest Green View Indexes below. 12.
