Clause 17 of the bill states that a Hindu widow \"shall have the right to re-marry of her own will and consent after the death of her husband provided a period of six months has lapsed after the husbandâ€™s death\".\nThe Senate committee under the chair of Muttahida Qaumi Movement Senator Nasreen Jalil took up the bill for discussion. \nSoon after the bill was approved, the committee room 4 in Parliament House echoed with jubilation as senators and officials of different ministries started thumping their desks.\nMinority member in National Assembly Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani called the move a new year's gift for Hindus living in Pakistan.\n\"Today, we are proud to be Hindu Pakistanis after the approval of the bill. Hindus will now be able to get registered their marriages and also apply for divorce under family laws,\" he said.\nTop constitutional expert Senator Aitzaz Ahsan said the bill is in accordance with the essence of the Constitution.\nAhsan clarified that the bill was not in contrast with Islamic jurisprudence as Islam emphasises protection of minorities.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T13:17:49.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
