The tide was really far out and there was a bit of a drop off .”\nThe Herald reports that the Sutherland Shire Council has now warned swimmers and pet owners walking dogs on the off-leash beach not to enter the water. Signs have been posted about the incident, as well.\nNigel told the newspaper they were about to leave the beach when Molly, who they rescued from a shelter two years ago, was taken. Sadly, the couple didn’t see the dog again and her body hasn’t been found.\n“It was very quick. It just took her under the water,” he said, adding that the shark was about 11 ft. long. “We just freaked out and we told a few people that we saw on the way back. I also rang the council to let them know.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T00:40:34.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
