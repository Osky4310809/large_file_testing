Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThousands of schools will see their funding slashed by 3% in plans that now face a major Tory rebellion. \nSo how will your area be affected by the national funding formula? \nResearch today reveals how deep the wounds will be in some of England's most deprived cities. \nThe Education Policy Institute (EPI) says many of those most in need will see their funding shifted away, including around 5,500 expected to lose the full 3%. \nEnter your postcode below to see how schools in your constituency are affected. \nThe Department for Education insists funding overall is at its highest level on record. \nIt says the changes are to even out inequalities and more than half of schools will get a cash boost. \nBut the EPI think tank warns once inflation is factored in, every school in England will see 'real terms' funding fall. \nThat hit is the equivalent of laying off six teachers for the average secondary school.

You can search them above or see the original figures here. \nConstituencies like Nottingham South, Lewisham East, Poplar and Limehouse and Manchester Gorton won't see a single school gain cash. \nMeanwhile Eastbourne won't see a single school lose out in cash terms, the EPI claims. \nA Tory rebellion is now on the cards over the changes, which are part of a consultation that ends on Tuesday. Let's hope Theresa May has done her sums - as a rebellion is brewing (Photo: Getty) \nGeoffrey Clifton-Brown - a Tory MP for 25 years - led a delegation of nine Conservative to see the Prime Minister this week. \nSpeaking today, he warned the nine MPs were the \"tip of the iceberg\". \n\"I think ministers recognise, and indeed I told (Education Secretary) Justine Greening in a later meeting, that this wouldn't go through in its present form,\" he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. \nMr Clifton-Brown said the Government would lose a vote in the Commons on the plans in their current form. \nHe added: \"This is only a consultation. George Osborne has been to see Education Secretary Justine Greening about the cuts (Photo: PA) \n\"The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Education have indicated very strongly that they are listening to the consultation, they will listen to what responses they get back. \n\"And I think knowing that they will have difficulty getting it through the House, they will have to alter it.\" \nFormer Chancellor George Osborne revealed he had met the Education Secretary to warn of \"teachers' concerns\". \nHe added: \"Everyone knows we need a new formula and that there isn't extra money lying around, but the money needs to be fairly distributed.\" \nConservative MP Stephen Hammond said he was \"very concerned\" at the move last night. Another Tory MP said the government's new policy \"fails in its job\" (Photo: PA) \nColleague Antoinette Sandbach added: \"It doesn't seem to have addressed the fundamental inequalities in the previous formula. \n\"So I would say this fails in its job and it has to be looked at again.\" \nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"School funding is at its highest level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years to £42bn in 2019-20. \n\"Under our proposed new funding formula schools will be funded according to their pupils' needs, rather than by their postcode, with more than half set to receive a cash boost. \n\"Of course we recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, which is why we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in cost effective ways. \n\"A recent report from the NAO outlines that schools should be able to make cost savings without affecting educational outcomes and our new School Buying Strategy is designed to help schools save over £1bn a year by 2019-20 on non-staff spend. \n\"We are consulting on the factors that will make up the formula and we know that it is important that we get this right so that every pound of the investment we make in education has the greatest impact. \n\"The consultation will run until March 22 2017, and we are keen to hear from as many schools, governors, local authorities and parents as possible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T19:54:17.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
