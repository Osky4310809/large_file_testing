Read more Show More “So it was by the din of his handwork, integrity and intelligence that he became GMD, through the goodwill of then President Goodluck Jonathan. For anyone to think that such a man, both in earnings, savings and goodwill cannot have the amount found in his house is to express his ignorance on how much even mid-cadre managers of the NNPC earn yearly. “A man who had solved the problems of perennial fuel queues during his time, tamed the militancy against oil installations and took Nigeria daily crude output to an all-time high of 2.5 million does not deserve this harassment. “Why are people who have been indicted in some high-level corruption not been so disparaged by the EFCC? It is simply because they are Hausa/Fulani? “Never, have we heard of someone, who is already, safely outside the Country willingly fly back and face opprobrium and humiliation, except Andy Yakubu. “Ahmed Gambo Saleh, a Registrar of the Supreme Court, now promoted to as the Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Judicial Commission, NJC, has been arraigned for corruption without this kind of deliberate destruction of his personality by the EFCC. Col Lawal Jaafaru Isa (rtd) military governor of Kaduna State was also charged for illegally taking N200m from the former National Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd), the man is walking as free as anyone. The Erstwhile Custom Comptroller General Abdullahi Dikko also was alleged to have helped himself to billions of Naira, the EFCC did not see him. “We are therefore beginning to feel that this is a concerted and well-orchestrated plan to pull down our illustrious son and sacrifice him to the dogs as a means of weakening the strong among us ahead 2019 general elections. “This is unacceptable and we say this with a loud voice that we are alaw-abidingg people and will remain so. But it will be height of cowardice and naivety to endeavor playing the politically correct card of keeping mute as our own is being sacrificed on the altar of a dubious corruption war. “Our stand: That Andy Yakubu on his own flew to the country from the US to defend his honour and how he earned the money shows that he was sure of himself if the law would be judiciously applied to his case. “The EFCC should free Andy Yakubu having fulfilled his bail conditions and the said amount temporarily forfeited to the Federal government. “Keeping him in detention for almost two weeks despite the above is a means of psychologically tormenting him and for the public to prolong their odium on his person, without giving him a chance to state his own side of the story. “If Andy Yakubu is not being persecuted because he comes from Southern Kaduna and the Middle Belt, we challenge the EFCC to also parade all the people it claims to have recovered humongous sums of money from. Failure to so would mean the agency is lying, or has two sets of law for two kinds of Nigerians. “We demand that this animal farm doctrine of putting some ahead of others desist immediately. We therefore call for full disclosure of persons found culpable and wanting. “We ask that persons, companies fronted and proxies connected directly or indirectly to any such matters be released. “And Yakubu should be charged to court as stipulated by the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria so that he can defend himself. “Enough of this parody of justice in which the EFCC is the accuser, the judge and the jailer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:12:54.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
