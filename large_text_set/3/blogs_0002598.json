Currently in Abu Dhabi, Kapoor and sons (and daughters) are busy having the time of their life at relative, Akshay Marwah’s wedding. Videos of the family have since surfaced, where the clan is seen flaunting their pro-level dance skills on iconic Bollywood numbers. But, what’s keeping us abnormally invested in this wedding (that we aren’t invited to) are the outfits that the ladies of the fam are dazzling in. In case you were on the lookout for exclusive wedding style, let the power pack of Sonam, Rhea, Sridevi, Jhanvi, and Khushi Kapoor, spell it out for you. Sonam Kapoor \nYou may never know what to make of this superiorly constructed Anamika Khanna outfit, but if the memo is cool-girl-at-the-wedding, this is what ought to be picked. Follow suit with bohemian hair, and bodice-framing silver jewellery. \nsonamkapoor/via Instagram \nAll-white-everything is a definite thing, as demonstrated by Sonam Kapoor. The Anamika Khanna lehenga, paired with middle-parted low bun is right up the actress’ alley. \nsonamkapoor/via Instagram Rhea Kapoor \nStylist extraordinaire, Rhea Kapoor, made a convincing case for grown-up glamour in a pink and black floral sari that was layered with a sophisticated long jacket, and finished out with a silver choker and a forehead-framing maangtika. rheakapoor/via Instagram Sridevi \nSridevi endorsed the new-age festive dressing in a languid blouse tucked in a Manish Malhotra lehenga, and massive jewels. The other time, the actress was seen in an ombre Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla sari with a low ponytail. Did someone say legendary style? manishmalhotra/via Instagram afashionistadiaries/idiva Jhanvi and Khushi Kapoor Manish Malhotra loyalists, Jhanvi and Khushi Kapoor, were spotted in gorgeous outfits by the designer on different occasions. Jhanvi sported a shoulder baring outfit, replete with floral embroidery, and Khushi picked a yellow garara-suit, also featuring a cold shoulder detail. manishmalhotra/via Instagram manishmalhotra/via Instagram Other outings included a glittering red-carpet worthy sheer number on Khushi, that ended in a hem of feathers and a blush pink contemporary lehenga on Jhanvi that, let’s just say, was blindingly glittery. Also, worthy of the sister’s soon-to-be-revered celebrity style. manishmalhotra/via Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T14:22:38.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
