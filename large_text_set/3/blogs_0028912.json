Between Grown Ups , Blended , and Pixels , each new film feels more like a paid vacation for Sandler, his sweatpants, and his comedian buddies than anything else. However, people like what they know, so Sandler continues to be a box office draw and Netflix record breaker , Razzie nominations be damned. Still, it’s not a bad gig if you can get it, and Sandler has made it quite clear that he doesn’t care at all about the bad reviews . It’s pretty easy to handle the ire of the internet when you’re sitting on a big pile of money.\nNetflix definitely still wants to be in the Adam Sandler business, and following the release of their upcoming collaboration Sandy Wexler , the streaming giant is ordering four more films with the SNL alum according to Deadline . Ted Sarandos, Netflix Chief Content Officer, released a statement extolling the continued partnership with Happy Madison, saying:\n“Adam Sandler one of the leading comedians in the film world, and his movies have proven to be extremely successful with our subscribers around the world.

I love how passionate they are about making movies and getting them out there for the whole world to see.
