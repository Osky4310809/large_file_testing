Is the silver bullet customer satisfaction, net promoter score, customer effort score , or some other measure? While this debate is unlikely to be settled anytime soon, we’d submit that there’s no question what the worst metric is for service: average handle time (AHT), which is principally a measure of call length, or, more simply, talk time.\nAHT has been around for almost as long as the telephone itself. Given that the service department is a cost center in most companies, service leaders have long relied on AHT as a critical lever for keeping staffing levels, and therefore costs, in check. It’s not surprising that the metric figures prominently on a service rep’s scorecard. It’s not unusual to walk into a contact center and see “leader boards” and stack rankings publicly celebrating those with the lowest AHT and shaming the slowpokes.\nWhy is average handle time such a bad metric for service? Three reasons:\nAHT is a relic of the old service world.  Customer service has changed dramatically since the advent of robust self-serve options for customers. The effect of options like company websites, discussion boards, YouTube videos, and so on is that they siphon off the low-complexity issues. Customer problems that end up making it through to live reps are the complex ones, the ones customers can’t solve on their own. While AHT might have been a fine way to gauge performance on simple issues like address changes, balance inquiries, or delivery tracking, when throughput was the name of the game, it’s a terrible way to assess performance on complex issues that by definition take more time to handle. What matters now is “Did the rep solve the customer’s problem?” not “How fast did the rep get the customer off the phone?”\nCustomers can hear the stopwatch ticking, too . When frontline agents are incentivized to lower AHT — and if they know that they’ll earn a reprimand from their supervisor for taking too much time with customers — they tend to rush their interactions, even if the customer’s issue demands more time. And customers can tell. In focus groups we’ve run, customers report that one of their biggest sources of frustration is the feeling that they’re being treated in a generic, robotic fashion and that the rep is trying to rush them off the phone rather than taking the time required to make sure their issue is resolved. Customers’ sense that they’re being “handled” rather than helped makes the experience feel high-effort to them, which our research (and common sense) shows depresses customer satisfaction.\nAHT is a culture  killer. Leading companies have realized that they get far better results from their service reps when they enable them to exercise more judgment in customer interactions. These companies aren’t asking their reps to figure things out on their own; they’re encouraging them to figure things out together. We call this a climate of “network judgment.” In a study we conducted, only 9% of all reps reported that they worked in this kind of environment — but those who did saw powerful results, performing 50% better according to measures of productivity and customer experience than reps in the average contact center. Enabling this type of climate is hard work. One of the steps to getting it right is to send reps clear signals that leaders trust them to use their judgment. Things like scripts, checklist-oriented quality assurance, and, worst of all, AHT send the exact opposite message to reps, showing that the company wants them to do exactly as they’re told, and quickly.\nRelated Video What People Really Want from Customer Service Results. Save Share See More Videos > See More Videos > Despite these obvious problems with AHT, managers are reluctant to eliminate the metric from rep scorecards. Most fear that doing so would cause call length to skyrocket, increasing costs. But our research suggests this fear is misplaced, as many companies we work with report that eliminating the metric had virtually no detrimental impact on costs. As Jill Stevens, national customer service leader at Westfield Insurance told us, “We thought AHT might rise after we removed it from the reps’ scorecards, and it did initially, but within three months it declined and so did our escalations and callbacks. Our reps tell us that their focus has shifted from watching the clock to focusing on active listening and resolving customers’ issues. AHT is now used only as a forecasting and planning metric.” Sharon Stines, director of operations customer care at LoyaltyOne, echoes the point this way: “Our process and metrics are aimed at delivering the right, rather than the shortest , handle time. As a result, we measure the contact handling process, the steps taken to assess and resolve customers’ issues, which allows our reps to focus on fixing the problem.” Other service leaders have told us that their reps actually became more efficient once they stopped reporting handle time at the agent level.\nAHT is still a useful measure for assessing organizational performance and understanding cost drivers for the contact center, but putting it on the rep scorecard or publicly rewarding or shaming reps for their call length is a holdover from a time when service organizations focused on the speed, rather than the quality, of the interaction or the outcome. In today’s service world, companies need to hold reps accountable less for being fast and more for being right.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:42:43.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
