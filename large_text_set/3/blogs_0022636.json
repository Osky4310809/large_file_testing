Zapatista Google Streetview Ownership of Scout Waterhouse + Kitchen , one of the best sports bars in the South Loop, appear to be taking over the neighboring Zapatista space at 1307 S. Wabash Ave. Scout partner Jeff Wolff is listed on a city building permit for the shuttered restaurant. Wolff is a contractor, designer, and also a partner at Ronero, the recently-opened South American-inspired restaurant and cocktail club on Randolph Restaurant Row. Wolff’s company, WolffHager, is listed on the permit to work on kitchen fixtures and dry wall work at the address. The permit was dated for last week. Wolff didn’t respond to a request for comment so it’s not clear if this is a Scout expansion or a new project from the team. Sloopin’ noted that a few Scout employees were seen going in and out of the Zapatista space. Zapatista served Mexican small plates in a lively party atmosphere. They expanded to Lincoln Park and suburban Northbrook, but the brand finally died in June 2015 when the origina l South Loop location closed. Come back for additional details when Wolff and his team are ready to share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:50:21.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
