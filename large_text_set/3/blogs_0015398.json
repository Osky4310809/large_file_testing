Rita’s is giving away Italian ice on Monday, March 20, and it’s pretty easy to get one. \nTo claim your free treat, visit your local Rita’s Italian Ice between 12 and 9 p.m. local time. While those are the official hours, some locations may cap lines early to finish serving by closing time. Due to high turnout for the event, it’s also possible for Rita’s to run out of your favorite flavor, so earlier is typically better. \nEach visitor is entitled to a free Italian ice on the first day of spring, but don’t try to send a friend to get some for you. Only one small ice will be given to each person. If you want multiple servings, a larger size or something fancier, like a gelati or blendini, you’ll have to pay. \nREAD: 5 cheap spring break getaways \nEveryone is entitled to one free serving of Rita’s ice on the first day of spring. Photo: Rita's \nMembers of the Rita’s Rewards Program will be happy to know that although this is a free ice, they’ll still get a free punch. In fact all Rewards accounts will be automatically given a free punch on Monday, so don’t worry about scanning any QR codes. \nAll local Rita’s are required to participate in the First Day of Spring Celebration. However, Rita’s inside of resorts, mobile units and special venue locations (like stadiums and theme parks) are not required to give free Italian ice on the first day of spring. Over 600 Rita’s will be participating, but you can always call your local store to confirm. Frozen treat fans can use the Rita’s Italian Ice locator to find your nearest store. \nThose who are looking to show off their free Rita’s ice on social media can enter the company’s photo contest. Tag your photos on Twitter, Instagram and/or Facebook with #RitasFirstDayofSpring to be entered in a contest to win a year of free ice. Runners up will receive Rita’s gift cards. The contest is open until Friday, March 24 at 11:59 p.m EDT.
