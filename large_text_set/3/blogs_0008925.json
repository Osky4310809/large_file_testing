Could   \nManchester United's 1-1 draw in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie against Rostov was a pretty decent result - especially given the Russian side's pitch - but it could have been a whole lot better. \nAfter Henrikh Mkhitaryan had given the Red Devils the lead , an equaliser from Rostov forward Aleksandr Bukharov pegged Jose Mourinho's side back, meaning that the Portuguese was forced to accept that his side wouldn't be able to take a victory into the second leg in Manchester in a week's time. \nAnd with not much else to talk about following what was a pretty dull game - Barca v PSG it certainly wasn't - United fans were left to debate the performance of a man who allowed Bukharov in for that equalising goal. A rare positive moment (Photo: John Peters) Oh, Phil (Photo: REUTERS) \nPhil Jones, playing in an unfamiliar United back three, didn't exactly have the best of nights - even if he did find time to full another funny face. \nAnd social media wasn't kind to him.
