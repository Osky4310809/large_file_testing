If only they held debates. \nAdvertisement \n\nFollowing the popular but re-painty Combiner Wars and the flimsy-headed Titans Return lines of nostalgia-fueled Transformers Generation toys, Power of the Primes is the third leg in what’s collectively known as the Prime Trilogy. The fan vote is playing a big part in shaping how that backstory of that line will play out, as whichever bot wins will take possession of the Matrix of Leadership (“Lighting our darkest hour since 1986\") and become leader of Cybertron. \nThe first round of voting saw fans choosing a leader for each of three factions—Honor, Chaos and Order. Honor wants to carry on the work of Optimus Prime, peacefully (like that ever works) working until all are one. Order wants to do away with the whole Autobot and Decepticon thing, uniting Cybertron as Cybertronians. Chaos candidates are warlords and tyrants, looking to seize power. \nAdvertisement \n\nI was sure the voting would go like this: \nHonor: Arcee\nChaos: Optimus Primal\nOrder: Megatron\nAt least I got one out of three. Here are the four candidates, one of which is a “wildcard” selection, meaning Hasbro really likes thay one and wants us to reconsider. \n\nUltra Magnus Representing Order, Ultra Magnus beat out Arcee and Hound for top billing. I think fans voted for him because they felt bad about him carrying about the Matrix after Optimus died in the 1986 movie, only to have to hand it over to the young upstart (Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime) who got Optimus killed in the first place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T16:31:55.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
