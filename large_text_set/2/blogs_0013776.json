With its Mercedes-AMG M158 5,980 cc, twin-turbocharged, dry-sump V12 engine, it produces 764 hp at 6,200 rpm and 1,000 Nm of torque at 2,400 rpm. \nThe headline output figures make the Huayra Roadster even more potent than the hitherto most powerful current Pagani, the Huayra BC with 750 hp. Weighing in at 1,280 kg dry, the Huayra Roadster is 80 kg lighter than the Huayra coupe, according to the manufacturer. \nDespite its increased output from the same swept capacity as before, the engine’s turbocharger turbines have been redesigned to provide “an immediate response without delay,” and the engine as a whole has been approved for compliance with Euro 6b and CARB emissions regulations, according to Pagani. \nEngine output is sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed, single-clutch gearbox by X-Trac with new carbon synchronisers, and is tranversely mounted, incorporating an electronically-controlled differential. The setup weighs approximately 40% less than an equivalent dual-clutch gearbox, says Pagani. \n“This is the most complicated project we have ever undertaken,” said founder Horacio Pagani of the Huayra Roadster. In its reworking from coupe to Roadster, the latter gains a more pronounced and aggressive “mouth”, along with wider wheel arches, re-shaped roll bars and upgraded interior. \nPagani cites the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL gullwing doors as inspiration for its own designs, while stating that the Zonda Cinque Roadster as the model best represented in the Huayra Roadster’s final design. \nThe Roadster manages to be lighter than its coupe sibling thanks to a new development in composite materials, namely the carbon-fibre/titanium composite the company has used prior. With the combination of Carbo-Titanium and Carbo-Triax HP52, it not only manages to make the Roadster lighter than the Coupe, but torsionally more rigid as well. Pagani considers the materials more advanced than those used in Formula 1. \nThe Pagani Huayra Roadster is set to make its public appearance at the Geneva Motor Show this March. As for the answer to the “if you have to ask” question, the Huayra Roadster starts from a base price of €2,280,000 plus taxes; all 100 units have been spoken for, according to Pagani. As par for the luxury course, there is plenty of scope to add considerably to that price tag via customisation. \nGALLERY: Pagani Huayra", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:43:37.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
