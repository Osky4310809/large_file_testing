By Gretchen McKay   \nForget our famed pierogies or Beantown’s equally celebrated Boston cream pie. This friendly food wager between fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots is all about doughnuts. \nMac’s Donut Shop, a third-generation family-run doughnut shop in Aliquippa, is so sure the Black and Gold will come out on top Sunday at Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass., that they’re betting Boston-based Kane’s Handcrafted Donuts on the outcome. \nIf the Steelers lose, they’ll send a dozen of their best-selling varieties to Boston, and, adding insult to injury, employees will don Patriots jerseys next week for a photo opp while baking their own doughnuts. If the Patriots come up short, it’s vice versa, with a dozen Kane’s doughnuts making their way to Pittsburgh. \nFans of both brands are encouraged to weigh in on social media, and both shops will have hometown team doughnuts on sale from now through Sunday. \nGretchen McKay: gmckay@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1419 or on Twitter @gtmckay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T00:05:40.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
