On March 4, duty called again as two terrorists - a local Kashmiri named Aquib and Lashkar-e-Toiba militant Farsan - were cornered by the army in a house in Tral, leading to a 16-hour pitched gunfight that ended with the death of the two terrorists. \nMajor Rishi was the first to reach the scene to hunt them down and it was his quick thinking and courage that won the day for the army. \nAlso read: J&K: Army jawan martyred in cross-border firing in Poonch \nCommanding his company in the Tral area, which has also produced terrorists like Burhan Wani, Rishi, who hails from Kerala, quickly deployed his troops and plugged any escape routes for his two targets. Aquib was the longest-surviving local militant from the area, army sources said. Within a short span of time, the troops had laid the cordon and occupied tactically advantageous positions to aim at the terrorists. They then started the process to plant explosives in the house to make the terrorists reveal their positions. Major Rishi moved into the house himself for the task. \n\"He moved in first to plant the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to bring the house down. This is considered to be the most dangerous and challenging job in an operation. He led his very professional Quick Response Team into the firefight, placed the IED and blew up a portion of the house,\" the source said. \nAlso read: Soldier suicide controversy: Communication gap between officers and jawans, feels Army top brass \nDue to the first explosion, the terrorists were forced to retreat into the rear portion of the house, giving the army team and local police troops an advantage to corner them further. However, after the continuing gun battle, the troops felt the need to blow up the remaining portion of the house too. The Major again volunteered to enter the house and place the IED. He went inside in pitch dark conditions in the middle of the night. \"While returning, Rishi spotted a better location and decided to place the bombs there as it would do more damage to the house,\" the source said. \nAs soon as he placed the bomb, one of the terrorists opened fire at him from point-blank range and a bullet hit directly on Rishi's face, knocking off his nose and badly damaging his cheek bone and jaw. Despite the grave injury, the officer realized that if he allowed the terrorist to move further, his team would be endangered. \"That very moment, the Major sprang up and used his AK-47 rifle to shred the terrorist in the quick moment before escaping outside safely with his team,\" the sources said. \nAlso read: Objected to menial work, Army never heard me, says jawan in new video \nArmy sources who have worked closely with Maj Rishi, say he was responsible for bringing in peace and stability to a great extent when Kashmir was burning over Burhan's Wani's death. \n\"His ability to speak and make friends with everybody resulted in him making many friends among locals notorious for spitting on patrols in the areaâ€¦ after Burhan's elimination, the area under him was the quietest with no stones thrown,\" they said. The officer is now recuperating in the Army Research and Referral hospital in Delhi. He can't speak but is interacting with family and colleagues through notes as he awaits more surgeries on his face. \nThe officer, his friends say, wants to return to the place where he last saw action even as locals from Tral ask about his health.
