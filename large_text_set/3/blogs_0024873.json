(The Washington Post) After some high-fiving, a drink or two and wiping away their tears of joy, Democrats should reflect on what opportunities the GOP health-care fiasco has opened up. President Trump despises failure and will now be famished for a “win.” That gives Democrats the chance to make some deals.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) looked pleased as punch today touting the survival of the Affordable Care Act. It would be a mistake, however, for Democrats to gloat too openly. Trump’s lack of ideological grounding and his voracious appetite for winning give them unusual leverage for a minority party.\nOn health care itself, Trump has already said he will work on negotiating directly with drug companies. Democrats should present him with a plan to do that plus to shore up the existing system, for example by improving insurance choices especially in rural areas where much of Trump’s base resides. (There are plenty of Republicans from red states and from more rural blue states such as Maine who would join in the effort.) This puts Trump back in the position to defend his base, annoy the Republicans who wouldn’t pass his health-care bill and recapture his populist mantle.\nWhile the iron is hot, Democrats should tell Trump what they would accept in a flash on infrastructure. Dangle the prospect of a huge bipartisan win in front of him, something to take away the sting of defeat.\nWith regard to tax reform, again, make him an offer he cannot refuse. Democrats will accept revenue-neutral tax reform and middle-class tax cuts. If Trump were to send such a plan to the House, would conservatives vote against it because it contains no tax cuts for the rich?\nIn other words, given Trump’s thirst to run from the scene of failure and the internal divisions on the right, there is a chance for some extraordinary dealmaking. While White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon rambles on about dismantling the “administrative state,” Trump wants to be popular, which in the short term means giving things to voters, not taking them away. In that respect, Trump’s populism has always been closer to Democrats’ political philosophy (although closer to the GOP on cultural matters).\nThis approach serves Democrats in two ways. First, they might get some of what they ask for. If not, they in effect set out an agenda they’d be happy to run on in 2018. Second, it will widen the already-considerable division among Republicans, allowing moderates to claim victories and giving the Freedom Caucus fits. There certainly are innumerable issues on which Democrats and Trump will disagree, but so far the Trump right-wing agenda (a Muslim ban, Trumpcare) has not delivered results. All Democrats need do is find a few areas on which they can agree, do the leg work (Trump’s staff is incapable of designing any legislation) and promise to deliver the votes. (Unlike House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Pelosi holds an iron grip on her conference.) The worst that can happen is that Trump does not take the bait.
