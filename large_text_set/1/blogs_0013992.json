Prospero Tenorio said stories of alleged extrajudicial killings (EJKs) in the country were reportedly a cause of concern for the 703 foreign delegates to the five-day event from Jan. 16 to 20. Some 2,296 local delegates would also join the congress. \nThe WACOM 4 delegates would be coming from 40 countries and 60 local dioceses and archdioceses. \nTenorio said that during the start of preparations for the congress, he got reports that some of the foreign delegates have heard about the EJK incidents in the country and have expressed concern. \n“At first there were concerns that there were killings or something like that, that there was no peace. But we said that this is a very important situation that because of our faith, we should not allow fear to rule over us,” said Tenorio. \nHe added that those who have become lost must feel the presence of God’s love in their lives. They should be given the opportunity to see the beauty in living.   \n“We must be able to show the importance of life,” the WACOM official said. \nHe said that even if there is no terrorist threat against the WACOM 4, the organizers assured the foreign delegates that they have good coordination for security. \nIn fact, the Philippine National Police (PNP) would be deploying 300 to 500 of their personnel at every venue. \nThere would be a different venue on each day of the WACOM. \nThe delegates were welcomed at the Manila Cathedral yesterday. \nThe delegates would be hosted by the University of Santo Tomas today, then go to Batangas on Wednesday, Bulacan on Thursday and finally visit Bataan on Friday. \nIn his homily during the first day of the WACOM 4 at the Manila Cathedral, Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle yesterday asked the Catholic faithful to show mercy to parents who have lost their children to violence and vices such as human trafficking. \nTagle said that the faithful should follow the example of Jesus who, when He was nailed to the cross, told his Mother Mary and his disciple John, “Woman behold your son, son behold your mother.” \nAt that crisis moment when Mary was about to lose her son, Jesus told her to accept John as her son because He did not want his mother to be alone. \nIn today’s society there are parents who have lost their children to acts of violence, criminal syndicates and vices. The mothers and fathers, in their time of need, at times seldom have people to go to, to comfort them. – With Louella Desiderio", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T05:14:10.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
