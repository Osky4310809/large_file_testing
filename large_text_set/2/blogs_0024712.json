But North Korea never signed the treaty, and it has spent decades developing a complex chemical weapons program. \nKim was not an obvious political threat to his estranged half brother, Kim Jong Un. But he may have been seen as a potential rival in North Korea's dynastic dictatorship, even though he had lived in exile for years. North Korea has denied any role in the attack. \nMalaysia said earlier in the week that Hyon Kwang Song, a second secretary at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, was wanted for questioning. But authorities acknowledged at the time he has diplomatic immunity and they couldn't compel him to appear. \nOn Saturday, Malaysia's tone changed. \nRelated: North Korea Condemns Lone Ally China Publicly for 'First Time' \nAbdul Samah, the police official, said authorities would give the diplomat reasonable time to come forward. \"And if he failed to turn up ... then we will go to the next step by getting a warrant of arrest from the court,\" he told reporters. \nLawyer Sankara Nair, however, noted that diplomats have immunity privileges even in criminal cases. Malaysia hasn't directly accused the North Korean government of being behind the attack, but officials have said four North Korean men provided two women with poison to carry it out. \nThe four men fled Malaysia shortly after the killing, while the women — one from Indonesia and the other Vietnamese — were arrested.

Aisyah, 25, said she had been introduced to people who looked like Japanese or Koreans who asked her to play a prank for a reality show, according to Erwin. \nAsked if she knew what was on her hands at the time of the attack, Erwin said: \"She didn't tell us about that. She only said that it's a kind of oil, baby oil, something like that.\" \nThe Vietnamese woman who was arrested, Doan Thi Huong, also thought she was taking part in a prank, Vietnam's foreign ministry said Saturday.
