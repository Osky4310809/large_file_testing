It looks like Honor has now quietly launched the device in Europe, as it is already available for pre-order in Finland with sales kicking off on February 17.\nThe smartphone looks more or less identical to the Honor 8 , which was announced last July. It features a glass back along with a metal frame and is initially available in black or white. However, more color options are coming down the line: you’ll be able to get the Honor 8 Lite in gold at the end of February and in blue a month later.\nIn terms of specs, the device comes with a 5.2-inch Full HD display and is powered by the Kirin 655 chipset. It sports 3 GB of RAM but only has 16 GB of storage. Luckily, there’s a microSD slot on board, so you can expand the storage for an additional 128 GB.\nSee also: Honor 8 Nougat update with EMUI 5.0 starts rolling out globally 2 weeks ago Unlike the Honor 8, the newly announced device features a single primary camera with a 12 MP sensor and an f/2.2 aperture. It is also equipped with an 8 MP selfie snapper, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, a 3,000 mAh battery and runs Android 7.0. Nougat with Huawei’s EMUI 5.0 user interface on top.\nThe Honor 8 Lite is an affordable smartphone and retails for €269 in Finland. We expect that it will soon be available in other European countries as well, as we have already seen the device listed – in all colors – on a Swedish retailer’s website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:17:40.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
