A conservative estimate puts it north of 15,000 hours. Pretty staggering, especially considering that these lectures come from world-class institutions like Stanford, MIT, Yale, UC Berkeley, and Oxford. And, what’s more, they’re free. Yes, there is such a thing as a free lunch … and dinner. Above, we’re featuring the first lecture from Michael Sandel’s famous Harvard course called Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do? .
