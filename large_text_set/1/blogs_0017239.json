They trade up top, and now Ortiz gets a single-leg, takes down Sonnen. Sonnen quickly sweeps, and now he goes to work. Looking for a D'Arce, now transitions to his side. He has a nice head lock on Ortiz, who is turning shades or red. The guillotine is pretty tight, but Ortiz pops out and now he's on top. Once again in the scramble Chael tries to buck, but now Tito has full mount. Wow. And he's raining elbows. He has Sonnen's back, and he's trying to choke him out. Sonnen turning red now. There's the tap. Wow. Ortiz taps out Sonnen! And he's digging the grave, and takes a bow.
