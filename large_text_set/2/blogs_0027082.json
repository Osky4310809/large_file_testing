He was not invited.\nIf fact, if the camp had not been held at his high school, it’s likely he may not have gotten in at all. West Orange coach Bob Head, however, urged camp officials to include Jackson, and then his star pass rusher made good of his coach’s efforts.\n“I had to pull some strings to get him in that camp,” Head said Monday. “I told the director, ‘Don’t be surprised if he’s not one of the most athletic defensive linemen that you’ve got in this entire camp.’ He can run, he can change directions, he has a great attitude, he’s a smart kid … there’s really nothing he doesn’t have.”\nThose who were unaware of Jackson before the event certainly know who he is now.\nJackson, a 6-foot-4, 220-pound junior defensive end, won the Big Man Skills Challenge at the Under Armour All-American Football Camp, and after it was over even Jackson didn’t fully realize everything he had accomplished.\n“I’m going to Baltimore? Really? ... How am I going to get to Baltimore,” Jackson said after another impressive camp showing.\nBaltimore is where the Under Armour nationals will be held this summer and fortunately for Jackson, mom was there to answer his question.\n“I got you. Don’t you worry about that,” said Barbara Jackson, laughing.\nEverywhere Tre Jackson goes, you can count on seeing the rest of the family in tow. Father Franklin Jackson II, mother Barbara and his younger sister 12-year-old Hailey are his biggest supporters. Older sister Heather is 21 and a student at the University of Florida . They have all a been positive influence in Tre’s rise to stardom as a young football player.\n“They’re great. You can’t find a better family than what they have,” Head said. “They are very supportive of the program and the parents are very involved with his academics, as well as the booster club … they’re just involved in everything. I couldn’t be more blessed than to have him in the program.”\nTre, whose given name is Franklin Jackson III after his father, showed out again Sunday, out-performing all of the other top linemen in the camp during the Big Man Skills Challenge. The final portion was a shuttle-type speed test in which he edged out Stacy Kirby, an FSU commit from Orlando Jones High, for the title.\n“I feel very good about how everything turned out,” said Jackson, who added that he enjoyed the home-field advantage. “It was nice. It was lovely. Could ask for nothing more.”\nJackson could be the poster boy for the adage that hard work pays off. He’s been grinding it out on the camp circuit for two years now and his improvement is a strong testament to his work ethic. He was a long, thin 195-pound freshman when he first stepped on the field at West Orange. Now he’s a molded 220-pounder with a quick first step that causes big problems for most bulky offensive linemen.\nBut it’s not just his size that has improved. He’s a technician who has developed sound habits and he prides himself in consistency.\n“He’s improved drastically and his work ethic has really taken him to a new level,” Head said. “He’s always been extremely fast for a big guy, just real explosive, but he’s also really developed the use of his hands and coming off the ball and attacking an offensive lineman. He’s really come a long way.”\nTo his credit, Jackson has always believed he would get to the level he is approaching and his confidence has driven him, but as Coach Head says, it’s not a misguided confidence.\n“He’s very confident, but very humble. He’s not an arrogant kid. He just knows he’s going to work extremely hard and I think he feels like nobody is going to outwork him,” Head said. “He’s going to put forth a lot of time and effort into it and he’s seen a lot of people around here be successful and so I really feel like that helps him.”\nJackson was also picked as one of the Top 5 defensive linemen at last week’s Nike The Opening Orlando regional event in Davenport.\n“There’s a high level of talent out here and I’m just extremely grateful that I can participate out here,” Jackson said. “It helps keep my technique in order and to make sure everything is where it needs to be so I can play on the next level.”\nHis first official scholarship offer came in on Monday from Central Arkansas, and even though it was a smaller school from the Football Championship Subdivision, he’s finally piqued the interest of several Football Bowl Subdivision programs.\nHis 3.8 GPA will also go a long way toward helping him corral his first FBS offer. Head said Northwestern, Wake Forest, Duke and NC State have already been expressing interest and it’s just a matter of time before he “blows up.”\n“I’m super anxious. I can’t wait for everything to just get rolling and watch the process,” said Jackson, who moved into the Top 20 of the Sentinel’s 2018 Central Florida Super60 this week.\n \nCaption Video: Trilion Coles talks about winning RB MVP at Nike The Opening Orlando Video: Trilion Coles talks about winning RB MVP at Nike The Opening Orlando\nVideo: Trilion Coles talks about winning RB MVP at Nike The Opening Orlando\nCaption Video: Trilion Coles talks about winning RB MVP at Nike The Opening Orlando Video: Trilion Coles talks about winning RB MVP at Nike The Opening Orlando\nVideo: Trilion Coles talks about winning RB MVP at Nike The Opening Orlando\nCaption Video: Eric Seidelman talks about Nike The Opening Orlando Bishop Moore center Eric Seidelman talks about Nike The Opening Orlando, in which he earned Top 5 honor among offensive linemen.\nBishop Moore center Eric Seidelman talks about Nike The Opening Orlando, in which he earned Top 5 honor among offensive linemen.\nCaption Grading state schools on National Signing Day FSU came out on top while UCF turned in a solid effort.
