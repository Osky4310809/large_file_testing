Now, Luddington is spilling the beans about the plan for her character going forward. \nIn an interview with TVLine , the actress said that currently, there is no plan for Jo -- who's going through plenty of personal drama right now thanks to Alex (Justin Chambers) and DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti) -- to be expecting, too. \n\"As of right now they are definitely hiding it,\" Luddington told TVLine of her growing baby bump. \"The struggle has just started.\" \nBut Luddington, who's due sometime in the spring, knows just as well as fans how much Shonda Rhimes loves throwing her characters curveballs, and teased that Rhimes and the rest of the \"Grey's\" writers still have time to reverse course if they see fit, especially since season 13 is not set to wrap for several more months. \n\"We have a lot more episodes to go this season, and these things can get sprung on us at a table read, so I really can't say for sure if it will stay that way,\" the actress said. \nFans will just have to wait and see if Jo's current drama will include baby drama, too. \"Grey's Anatomy\" returns from its winter hiatus on January 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:10:21.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
