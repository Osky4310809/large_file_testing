Trump's Russia mess: Five things to know \nFlynn stepped down after revelations that he had failed to disclose talks with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office about US sanctions on Moscow and mislead Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. \nQuestions remain about the scope of the discussions and what other contacts took place between other Trump advisers with the Russians. \nEarlier this week, the White House disclosed that Trump's son-in-law and White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met executives of Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB, in December. \nUS intelligence agencies have said Russia hacked emails of senior Democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information in a bid to tip the presidential election in favour of Trump, whose views were seen as more in line with the Moscow's. \nRussia has denied the allegations and Trump has dismissed suggestions of links with Moscow. \nThe Wall Street Journal, citing officials with knowledge of the matter, reported on Thursday that Flynn had sought immunity from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the House and Senate intelligence panels in exchange for his testimony. The newspaper said he had so far found no takers. \nThe House denied the Journal report. \"Michael Flynn has not offered to testify to HPSCI in exchange for immunity,\" committee spokesman Jack Langer said in a statement. \nThe FBI declined to comment. The Senate committee did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. \nKelner's statement did not mention the FBI. \nHe said Flynn \"is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated\". \nKelner said Flynn would not \"submit to questioning in such a highly politicised, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution\".
