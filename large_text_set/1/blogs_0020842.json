Thursday: the receivers. Up next: The offensive line. \nTake a wild guess who the Broncos’ third-leading receiver was this past season. Virgil Green ? Jeff Heuerman ? A.J. Derby? Nope, nope. nope. Jordan Norwood , Bennie Fowler , Jordan Taylor or Cody Latimer ? Nope, times four. It was rookie Devontae Booker, who spent half the season as the Broncos’ backup running back. He had 265 receiving yards. \nHaving a dependable third receiver has been a problem for two years now. It’s a problem Joseph can’t ignore as he seeks to upgrade the offense. \nThe Broncos’ pass catching building blocks are clear. Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders form one of seven duos in NFL history to each have 1,000 receiving yards in three consecutive seasons. Denver has two of the top 15 receivers in the league, and arguably the best tandem. Related Articles January 18, 2017 Building Broncos: RBs, It’s still about C.J. Anderson’s health, production \nBut the drop-off is steep after that. Part of the problem has been Denver’s quarterback play, which has been among the worst in the NFL over the past two seasons. Thomas and Sanders, though, have remained consistent. Their paychecks reward them for it, too, with each signing contracts in the past year and a half worth more than an average of $10 million a year. \nYet no Broncos receiver or tight end has stepped up to become a consistent third threat for defenses to respect and take attention off Thomas and Sanders. \nThe Broncos wide receivers not named Thomas or Sanders (Norwood, Fowler, Latimer, Taylor and Kalif Raymond) combined for 56 catches, 662 yards and five touchdowns last season. The Broncos tight ends – Green, Heuerman, Derby, John Phillips and Henry Krieger-Coble – combined for 53 catches, 591 yards and two touchdowns. \nLook for Denver to add another weapon or two to its receiving corps either through the draft or in free agency. Helen H. Richardson, The Denver Post Oakland Raiders cornerback David Amerson (29) tackles Broncos wide receiver Cody Latimer during the third quarter of an NFL game at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Jan. 1, 2017, in Denver. \nNorwood is a free agent and the Broncos probably won’t be in a hurry to re-sign him. They need a true slot receiver to fill that role. Sanders hasn’t and probably won’t play slot full-time. Latimer, who is entering the final year of his contract, has 16 catches in a disappointing three-year career. Fowler has been inconsistent. Taylor doesn’t have the skill set to play inside. \nTitans slot receiver Kendall Wright is a free agent and could be a good pick-up at a cheap price. The best option, however, will be seeking upgrades in the draft. \nWashington’s John Ross, Ohio State’s Curtis Samuel, Eastern Washington’s Cooper Kupp and Oklahoma’s Dede Westbrook fit as slot receivers if the Broncos seek to add one in the first three rounds. \nThis year’s tight-end draft class might be better than the receiver group. Alabama’s O.J. Howard, Miami’s David Njoku, Virginia Tech’s Bucky Hodges, South Alabama’s Gerald Everett and Clemson’s Jordan Leggett are athletic tight ends with a proven ability to catch the ball. Howard is the most complete of the five. All could be chosen in the first three rounds. \nThe Colts’ Jack Doyle or the Texans’ Ryan Griffin could be reasonably priced free-agent options as tight ends. \nGreen’s greatest value was as a blocker. He’s also entering the final year of his contract holding a $3.3 million cap hit. Derby showed promise, but was inconsistent. \nA quarterback needs a safety valve, someone to depend on when it’s third down or the Broncos are in the red zone. The Broncos need to find that player, either at tight end or in the slot.
