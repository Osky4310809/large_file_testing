Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA man who once appeared on the MTV show Catfish has died in a motorcycle accident at the age of 33. \nRobert Brian Clark passed away in December but the news was only brought to the attention of Catfish viewers this week when the latest episode paid tribute to him. \nA local news report from his Birmingham, Alabama hometown explained Robert - who went by the name Brian - was killed after a motorcycle crash flung him into the path of an oncoming vehicle. He was who he said he was (Photo: Facebook) \nHis episode of Catfish aired during series two; it revolved around a girl named Jesse Bettinger who was desperately trying to track down a man she’d been speaking to for three years online. \nThey'd met on Facebook via one of Jesse's friends who served in the Marines alongside Brian in Afghanistan, but she worried whether he was being truthful to her after he failed to show for a planned meeting. \nHowever, unlike many episodes of the show, hosted by Max Joseph and Nev Schulman, where the mystery person online is not who they say they are, in Brian’s case, he was the person in his photos and everything he’d told Jesse was true.
