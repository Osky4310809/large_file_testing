By Robert Purchese Published 04/03/2017 \nDo not apply a vinyl skin or wrap to your lovely new Nintendo Switch. The surface of the console and Joy-Cons reacts badly to the adhesive, causing the outer coating and logos to peel off. \nDbrand, a prominent skin manufacturer, nobly brought the issue to light. It had been testing Switch consoles - one pre-release and 10 retail units - prior to skin production. \n\"We're here to make a public service announcement that under no circumstances should you be buying a vinyl skin / wrap for your Nintendo Switch,\" wrote dbrand on the Switch subeddit , where it has understandably become something of a hero. \n\"Both the Joy-Cons and the console are not compatible with vinyl wraps or any adhesive-backed skin of any kind.\" Yay! Phwoar. Looks a bit like a cake... Oh, hang on... Everything we know about Project Scorpio How powerful Microsoft's next system will be, backwards compatibility and more. Oh no. \nDbrand added: \"This is really quite unfortunate, not just because we were going to make a ton of money from this console, but moreso because it genuinely did look dope with a skin.\" \nDbrand will refund anyone who pre-ordered a Switch skin with it. \nJolly good show, dbrand. \nYou can catch up with all of our Nintendo Switch launch coverage, including reviews and technical tests , all in one handy place.
