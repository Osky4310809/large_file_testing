Luongo said his agent contrasted his situation to that of former Spurs youth teammate Harry Kane, who stayed at the club to become one of the best strikers in the world. \nYet he urged his client to keep \"doing it the hard way.\" \n\"And I don't regret any of my choices,\" Luongo said. \n\"Leaving to Swindon on a permanent was the best thing I could have done, just getting first-team football was what I wanted and I proved myself at that level. \n\"At the moment I'm trying to prove myself at Championship level, I think I'll be better off if I do that and hopefully get to the top.\" Alison Bender and Gab Marcotti discuss whether moving to the Chinese Super League would be the right move for Diego Costa. \nThe decision to stay put will likely reap international rewards for Luongo. \nThe 24-time Australian midfielder is playing every week for QPR -- a key selection factor for Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou as crucial World Cup qualifiers and the Confederations Cup approaches. \nHis compatriots in China may soon encounter difficulty on that front, after the Chinese Super League unexpectedly reduced the number of imports allowed on the pitch from four to three. \nTrent Sainsbury (Jiangsu Suning), Apo Giannou (Guangzhou R&F), Robbie Kruse (Liaoning Whowin) and Ryan McGowan (Henan Jianye) all currently play in the competition. \nSainsbury is particularly up against it to retain a starting spot in China against the likes of Brazilian stars Ramires and Alex Teixeira, Korea's Hong Jeong-Ho and Colombia's Roger Martinez. \nMatthew Spiranovic may also struggle for quality club soccer after Hangzhou Greentown were relegated to the second division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:38:11.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
