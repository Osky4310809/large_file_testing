(Michael Miller/The Washington Post) The flowers were pink, like the dress she had picked to wear at her quinceañera.\nThe casket was a silvery white, like the shoes in which she’d planned to dance.\nInstead, those were the colors that accompanied Damaris Alexandra Reyes Rivas to her grave.\nFriends and relatives gathered at a church in Gaithersburg, Md., on Thursday morning to bury Damaris, who police say was killed by members of MS-13 in January. The 15-year-old’s body was found Feb. 11 near an industrial park in Springfield, Va. She’d been missing for weeks.\nPolice have arrested 10 people in connection with the killing, as well as six more for a related slaying.\nThere was no mention of MS-13 on Thursday, but fear of the gang, known in El Salvador as Mara Salvatrucha, was everywhere. At least six Gaithersburg police cars were positioned around the St. Rose of Lima church. Plainclothes police attended the funeral — their guns bulging beneath suit jackets — and uniformed officers watched over the burial from a distance.\nPerhaps because of the fear of violence, the pews were mostly empty. About 50 people attended, primarily family members plus a few of Damaris’s friends and teachers from Watkins Mill High School.\nOn a tripod near the casket stood a framed photo of Damaris staring dreamily into the distance. Several people wore ­T-shirts bearing the same photo.\n“You left a hole in our hearts,” the T-shirts read. “We will remember you forever.”\nWhen Damaris arrived in Maryland in 2014, it had been a decade since she’d last seen her mother, Maria Reyes, left. (Family photo) Damaris’s mother, Maria Reyes, sat in the front row alongside her husband and Damaris’s grandmother, who was given a visa to come to the United States from El Salvador for the funeral.\nIt was that grandmother who had raised Damaris after Reyes fled the violence in their home town of San Vicente in 2005. Damaris was 12 when her mother paid $11,000 to have her smuggled into the United States.\nReyes thought she was saving her daughter from MS-13, only for her daughter to fall prey to the very same gang in this country.\n[ She thought she’d saved her daughter from MS-13. She was wrong. ]\nWhen Damaris disappeared from their home in Gaithersburg on Dec. 10, Reyes notified police but also began her own investigation into her daughter’s whereabouts. She hacked into Damaris’s Facebook account and discovered death threats, then drove frantically around Maryland and Virginia searching for her.\nBut it was too late. Damaris was already dead.\nPolice say that she was killed around Jan. 8 in Lake Accotink Park in Springfield, Va., and that her body was dumped nearby.\nOn Thursday, Reyes wept as she placed an embroidered cloth, or pall, over her daughter’s gleaming casket, which had pictures of roses on it.\nAnother family member broke down. “My love,” she screamed. “You’ll always be in my heart.”\nIn his sermon, the Rev. Agustin Mateo-Ayala said Damaris’s killing was a senseless and “unnecessary” tragedy but asked her family not to search for answers or vengeance.\n“Don’t try to understand why these things happen. I don’t understand,” he said in Spanish, walking over to the family. “You have to forgive. That’s the only way to find inner peace.”\nMateo-Ayala said a prayer and waved incense over Damaris’s casket.\nAs the service ended and cantors sang “Amazing Grace,” Damaris’s stepfather and five other men, most of them in black leather jackets, guided the casket outside, into the midday sunlight and up a hill to the burial site. They lifted the casket off a collapsible dolly and placed it above the grave.\nAs Mateo-Ayala read a final prayer, Reyes perched on the edge of her daughter’s grave. She leaned over the casket and kissed it, then ran her hands over it as if making a bed.\n“Te amo, siempre,” she whispered in Spanish. “I love you, always.”\nA gravedigger lowered the casket into the ground before family members and friends dropped pink and white roses into the grave.\n“I want to thank you all for coming,” Reyes said, standing at the head of her daughter’s open grave. “She would have been grateful to see you. She planned to invite the whole world to her quinceañera, but she never got the chance. They finished her off first.\n“But she’s happy,” she said, gazing down into the grave. “This morning, I dreamed about her. I dreamed that she gave me a big smile. She was dressed in white, and she smiled like only she could.\n“So I know that she is happy.”\nRead more:\nShe thought she’d saved her daughter from MS-13 by smuggling her to the U.S. She was wrong.\nThis company is making millions from America’s broken immigration system\nShe fought deportations.
