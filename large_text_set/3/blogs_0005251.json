Our sources say reps for both sides went back and forth several days ago but Marlon wanted more than the network was willing to pay.\nBrandon -- who's hysterical as a rapper on \"You're the Worst\" -- will cost way less, but one source said the other advantage is that he will become part of the show in a more seamless way than Marlon, who has an extremely strong brand independent of the show.\nOne source warns these deals sometimes fall apart at the very end, but it looks like Brandon will get the gig.\nAs we reported, Nick Cannon quit the show after a dispute with NBC.
