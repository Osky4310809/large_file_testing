So yes I would say there's great unanimity,\" Tillerson said. \nMitchell on Twitter Thursday prefaced a tweet about Tillerson's response with the words \"He speaks\" in parentheses. (He speaks) #RexTillerson says there is great unanimity with Saudi allies in war on ISIS at photo op with Saudi FM Adel al Jubeir — Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) March 23, 2017 \nTo be fair, Tillerson has occasionally responded very briefly to other reporters' shouted questions at photo opportunities in the past. On Wednesday night, for example, during an appearance with Singapore's foreign minister, he expressed condolences to the victims of a terror attack in London.
