Advertisement \nIn New England, centers in Newton; Worcester; Portland, Maine; and West Hartford, Conn., received threats Wednesday. Some organizations were evacuated out of an abundance of caution, the Anti-Defamation League said, but inspections by authorities turned up nothing suspicious. \n“Whoever is behind it is targeting Jewish institutions and trying to intimidate and threaten the community,” said Robert Trestan, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Boston office.

The anxiety is quite palpable and high right now.” \nJewish organizations in Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas also got threats, the Anti-Defamation League said. Advertisement \nThe league issued an advisory for Jewish institutions nationwide, urging them to bolster security and review procedures for responding to threats. \nTrestan said security training that Jewish organizations have engaged in over the years with the league’s help had prepared them to respond. “Their staff knew what to do when the call came in,” he said. \nIn Newton, the Leventhal-Sidman Jewish Community Center received a threatening phone call about 9:45 a.m. Wednesday. The building was evacuated, and police and fire department officials searched the center. They gave the all-clear within an hour, said Samantha Levine-Neudel, spokeswoman for the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Boston, which oversees centers throughout the area. \n“We got a call on our main line, and our staff executed their training immediately,” said Mark Sokoll, president of the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Boston. “Our job is to always be prepared.” Globe correspondent Maddie Kilgannon contributed to this report.
