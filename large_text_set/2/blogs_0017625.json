But sadly, sometimes acting can be a dangerous job. Milo Ventimiglia explained his prominent arm cast , and we’re glad it was brought up, since we had more than a few questions. Did he break something? Did he get into another fight with Dean at Kyle’s house ? We hope not.\nVentimiglia was there to promote the last few episodes of This Is Us , where he plays notable father Jack Pearson. Since his right arm was front and center, he definitely addressed it before addressing the forthcoming emotional episodes of his hit drama.\nOf course, Fallon helps him think up a few stories to make his story sound slightly more badass. The real story? Ventimiglia had to have surgery on his arm due to a few torn tendons. Ouch.\nWhat we prefer is his original account. Simply put, he got into a knife fight. “With a surgeon,” Ventimiglia made sure to add.\nFallon, who is pretty much the king of improv , decided to spice up the story a bit. In his mind, Ventimiglia is a secret gambler who only plays slot machines. But, it goes beyond a casino. Instead, fictional Ventimiglia actually owns his own slot machine for some reason.\n“You’re that bad of a gambler that you just bought one and you sit out, and people are really upset, they try to have interventions with you,” Fallon joked while ideas streamed in. \nVentimiglia made sure to joke that this could all be set up as a plot for the second season of This Is Us . Hey, we’re sure that the cast and crew would make that scenario pretty believable!\nNo matter what, he’s definitely making the most of the situation. Ventimiglia referred to the cast and sling as a “catch-all,” meaning that he’s using it to store his phone, wallet and other accessories. Move over, pockets!\nNBC “I feel like an older gal who puts her phone in her bra,” Ventimiglia joked. We hope Milo Ventimiglia recovers quickly — and also hope he doesn’t take up gambling in the meantime.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:49:51.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
