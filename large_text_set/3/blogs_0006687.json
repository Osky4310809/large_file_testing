OTT specializes in shepherding research developed at the national labs into the private sector, an area in which Bowdidge didn't seem to have any experience. Story Continued Below \nBefore joining DOE, Bowdidge worked for the Trump campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records. An August 2015 NBC News report quoted Bowdidge attending a debate watch party in Trump’s New Hampshire campaign office, describing him as a “massage therapist from Bedford.” \nDOE employees were unsettled by Bowdidge’s caustic Twitter account, on which he accused then-President Barack Obama of having terrorist \"relatives\" and spouted anti-Muslim views. By Rachana Pradhan \nPOLITICO took several screenshots of Bowdidge’s Twitter account Thursday night before it was made private sometime Friday. \nIn a tweet on Dec. 6, 2015, Bowdidge wrote that “Obama won’t use the term radical Islam because they’re his relatives!!!!” A day later, replying to a CNN tweet that included a picture of the suspected San Bernardino shooters, Bowdidge wrote , “Scum sucking maggots of the world. Exterminate them all.” \nAnd during a dispute with someone on Twitter a week later, Bowdidge replied to the person \"wouldn't say that if it was your wife, sister or family member that was murdered by some Muslim piece of shit.\" \nDOE said Friday that Bowdidgeis not with the agency anymore. Greentech Media reported earlier in the day on his social media history and apparent lack of qualifications. \n“Normally, we do not comment on personnel matters. In this case, we can confirm that Sid Bowdidge is no longer employed at the Department of Energy,” said Bob Haus, a DOE spokesperson. \nThe one-stop source for energy and environment news Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Several Trump appointees to the Education Department have also been found to have shared controversial views about women, African-Americans and transgender people, among others. \nBowdidge’s unfiltered opinions caught the attention of some DOE staff. \n“Every time there’s a new political that comes in, we’re all ‘Who is this guy? What’s his background?’” the career staffer told POLITICO. OTT staff hadn’t received many details about Bowdidge’s official responsibilities, experience or position but their Google searches turned up some “colorful” information. \n“This person’s in charge of, theoretically, overseeing the policy around commercializing billions of dollars of federal research,” the employee said. “This guy seems like he’s pretty far out, and we just don’t know. It looks like sort of a ridiculous appointment.” \nBowdidge could not be reached for comment. \nFormer Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz launched OTT in 2015 to help address longstanding bureaucratic hurdles involved with getting research from its 17 national labs into the marketplace. Rochelle Blaustein, the senior member of OTT’s career staff, has been serving as the office’s acting director.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:59:38.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
