They get scared that if they get separated, they can’t take the kids,” said Gina. \nGina is an undocumented immigrant that’s been in the states for about 16 years. \n“I pretty much came just to protect my son, if anything happens to me, he can go with me, anywhere I go,” she said. \nAs immigration enforcement ramps up, some citizens appear to be wary and just want to make sure they’re prepared. \n“I think everybody’s just getting their passports to make sure they have it in case anything happens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:37:43.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
