Apparently, the university presidents were hoping for a more substantial meeting with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and other federal officials to talk about Pell Grants, according to Walter M. Kimbrough, president of Dillard University.\n\"That all blew up when the decision was made to take the presidents to the Oval Office to see the president,\" he wrote on Medium . \"I’m still processing that entire experience. But needless to say that threw the day off and there was very little listening to HBCU presidents today ... \"\nSo Trump got a photo op, Kellyanne got to kick her feet up, and college students got to continue to worry about debt. Sounds about right.\nBONUS: Viola Davis is the first black woman to win an Emmy, Tony, and now, an Oscar for acting", "external_links": ["https://t.co/I2BiqNNgAS", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/iE2QkX2K.m3u8", "https://t.co/tU0CBS36Fe", "https://t.co/aiLh25TbIU", "https://twitter.com/samir/status/836411196861460480", "https://t.co/erb0KwyoBr", "https://twitter.com/amylutz4/status/836410919672410112", "https://twitter.com/anamariecox", "https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls", "https://t.co/JLE16uQFsF", "https://t.co/rHhc6jv4xN", "https://t.co/7AhCHsDhlE", "https://medium.com/@HipHopPrez/my-statement-white-house-hbcu-event-bf51a619194a#.4myujuez8", "https://twitter.com/AFP/status/836388576413675520", "https://twitter.com/keiththornhill/status/836421519563706368", "https://t.co/MgVhCoJFuC", "https://t.co/Wl33PwhuAP", "https://twitter.com/arthurct20/status/836408096960495619", "https://twitter.com/JeffHechtAZ/status/836404515569983489", "https://twitter.com/RexHuppke/status/836402879309152256", "https://twitter.com/mathewrodriguez/status/836431208129114112", "https://twitter.com/Sandy_Dover/status/836409292903305216", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/iE2QkX2K.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-28T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:38:34.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
