The ESPN FC panel debate how much the refereeing played into PSG's shock defeat to Barcelona. Gianni Infantino says the incredible comeback by Barca in the UCL shows that changes to the game shouldn't be made hastily. \nThe referee who officiated Paris Saint-Germain's 6-1 Champions League defeat to Barcelona will not be suspended for his performance, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has said. \nA source close to PSG told ESPN FC last week that the Ligue 1 champions had written to UEFA about Deniz Aytekin's refereeing. \nUnai Emery's men collapsed at Camp Nou as Barca completed an unlikely comeback to advance 6-5 on aggregate. \nBut Ceferin said there would be no sanctions for UEFA official Aytekin. \n\"We will not suspend the referee from that match, referees are not suspended,\" he told AFP. \n\"When something doesn't go well, we discuss it -- but it is not a matter for suspension. \n\"That would be like suspending a player who missed a penalty kick when he should simply go to the bench if he misses many penalty shots.\" \nA PSG source said the club believe Barcelona were aided by a number of dubious decisions from the German official. \nEmery said his team \"lost everything\" because of decisions late in the match, while PSG chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi felt his team were denied \"two penalties.\" \nPSG listed Luis Suarez's alleged dive for Barcelona's second penalty and Javier Mascherano's foul on Angel Di Maria -- which the former later admitted to -- as two of the main transgressions. \nMarca reported that PSG had submitted an official complaint to Ceferin. \nA penalty not given for Mascherano's first-half handball, Gerard Pique not receiving a second yellow card, Thomas Meunier's foul on Neymar for Lionel Messi's goal from the penalty spot and a Neymar foul on Marquinhos were included among PSG's complaints. \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:14:51.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
