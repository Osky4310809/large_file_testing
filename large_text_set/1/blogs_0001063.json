The video below, on the other hand, is a foaming fountain made using hydrogen peroxide and dish soap (along with a few other ingredients.) \nEach video is great about showing you all of the ingredients and items you’ll need for each experiment, and whether it’s the kind of thing that’s safe to try at home with or without adult supervision, in case you’re thinking about getting the kids interested in a little science. Give these ones a watch, and then check out the others at the Labracadabra Facebook page below.
