That’s right, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 3 could still be a thing, according to America Ferrera. The star of the first two films told E! News another movie is “an idea and a conversation.”\n“I think it would be amazing,” Ferrera explained. “The sisterhood is still well and alive. I love my girls. We’re very much a part of each other’s lives and if the movie happens it would be a great thing.” Ferrera has said her co-stars ( Alexis Bledel , Amber Tamblyn, and Blake Lively) are still some of her best friends and supporters, and told E! News, “We would love to get paid to hang out with each other. That would wonderful.” \nAll grown up. #blakesfingerinmynose #ambersfingerinmymouth #alexisisatruelady #sisterlove #holdtighttotheonesyoulove \nA post shared by America Ferrera (@americaferrera) on Jul 8, 2016 at 11:01am PDT \nBledel also confirmed that at a new film could become a reality on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon in November, saying, “I think it would be so much fun. We talk about it. I think we should absolutely do it. We’re working on it, so we’ll see if it happens.”\nThe book series, published in 2001, contains five books total, so it only makes sense that the movies continue. Two long years ago, Ferrera said on the Meredith Vieira Show that a script was being written , though the movie itself hadn’t gotten the green light yet.\nSo, a script seemingly exists somewhere in the world, and at least two of the four stars are on board — what’s the hold up? The world needs more lighthearted movies about female friendship and traveling pants.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T02:29:43.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
