I trust [that I will] stay. \n\"I trust the president [Josep Maria Bartomeu] and my representative Arturo Canales, who are talking. \n\"I want to help get all the titles we want, which are many for the best club in the world.\" \nRakitic took on Busquet's organisational duties in midfield after the Spain international suffered ankle ligament damage against Eibar and saw Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all on target in a 4-0 triumph. \n\"The three players we have up front seem to be from another world,\" he added. \n\"We enjoy them a lot and if others can do something to improve it we do it.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T09:37:19.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
