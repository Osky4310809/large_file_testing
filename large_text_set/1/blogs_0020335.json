I will not complain that I have all the cards. \n\"I like Rakitic in the pivot position. He was especially good and I have also liked Arda [Turan]. They all contribute things to the benefit of the team. \n\"We have been able to give minutes to players who have not had so many minutes and give rest to others.\" \nThe victory over Eibar saw Messi score his 28th goal of the season while Luis Suarez netted his 19th, but Luis Enrique said the scoreline did not reflect the difficulty of the test provided by their hosts. \nHe said: \"I have seen many positive things, although at the beginning of the match we have been under pressure from Eibar. Then we managed to take that pressure off and create danger. \n\"Every time we have come to Ipurua we had to make a great game, even if the result says it seemed easy.\" \nBarcelona are two points behind LaLiga leaders Real Madrid, although the capital side have a game in hand, but Luis Enrique gave an optimistic assessment of his side's title chances in the second half of the season. \nHe said: \"The balance is good, always improvable, but we are ready to fight for every title. \n\"The goal is to improve and we have not yet hit a good stretch.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:44:00.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
