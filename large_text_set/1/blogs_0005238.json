He played baseball at St. Mary's College in Winona, Minn., but he chose golf over baseball at first. According to a June 2009 story in the Chicago Tribune, Zielinski was an assistant golf pro in Phoenix when he met White Sox scout Bill Kimball. The two went to college games, and Zielinski always had an opinion about the players. Kimball recommended Zielinski to the White Sox for a job as a part-time scout in the Chicago area in 1979. \nGary Hughes was the Expos' scouting director when he hired Zielinski to a full-time job, and Zielinski then joined the Marlins' scouting department before coming to the Cubs. Among the players he discovered were outfielder Cliff Floyd and left-handed pitcher Kirk Reuter. has covered the Cubs since 1987, and for MLB.com since 2001. She writes a blog, Muskat Ramblings .
