In his WCW days, Goldberg would often be escorted to the ring by a squad of police officers, only after he headbutted his dressing room door and nearly ripped it off the hinges. \nOn Monday night’s episode of Raw, with just a few days left until the Royal Rumble, Goldberg closed the show by coming to the ring and declaring that he’s going to win the Universal Championship.
