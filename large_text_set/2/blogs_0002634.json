We all have a list of people we’d sleep with given the chance, regardless of our relationship status, and chances are most of those people are celebrities. I mean, they’re everywhere you look; they’re on tv, in the movies, in the media, all over social media and after all that, there’s no way you don’t think “man, I’d love to just have one night with him/her.” So, who’s on your list? \nLucky for you, the smart folks over at Sleep Cupid , were wondering just that very thing, and conducted a survey of over 6,000 people to see who’s the most desired celebrity in the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Europe, and they’ve put it all together in a handy little set of graphs. \nBut since we’re the visual sort here at theCHIVE, we grabbed some pictures of the ladies that made the list, just for you. \nStarting off with the US.
