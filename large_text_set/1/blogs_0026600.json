We already knew that Adele, Bruno Mars, Metallica, John Legend, Keith Urban, and Carrie Underwood were planning to perform at the big show. And now we know that they’ll be joined by some big, cool names. \nDaft Punk haven’t done any sort of live performance since the 2014 Grammys, when they performed with Stevie Wonder, Pharrell, and Nile Rodgers. (They won Album Of The Year at that same ceremony.) But now they’ll return to that stage for their first performance in three years, joining the Weeknd on their collab “ I Feel It Coming .” Meanwhile, a Tribe Called Quest and Anderson .Paak will perform together, presumably doing their We Got It From Here… Thank You 4 Your Service collab “Movin’ Backwards.” And the list of performers will also include Dave Grohl, Alicia Keys, and the great rising country star Maren Morris. This could be a pretty fun show! \nThe Grammy Awards will air 2/12 on CBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:08:05.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
