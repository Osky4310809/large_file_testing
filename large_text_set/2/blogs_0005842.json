Currently, the seven-seater MPV is only available there in 1.4 litre petrol form , the same one that is sold here as the Proton Ertiga . \nIn case you missed it, the oil-burning Ertiga is powered by a 1.4 litre D13A 1.3 litre DDiS turbodiesel, linked to the Smart Hybrid Vehicle by Suzuki (SHVS) system. This mild hybrid setup includes a Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) in place of an alternator, providing automatic engine start/stop and regenerative braking, as well as assistance to the engine under acceleration. \nThe whole ensemble is mated to the only transmission option offered – a five-speed manual – as well as a larger battery. All in all, total system output stands at 90 hp and 200 Nm of torque, one horsepower down but 70 Nm up on the petrol. In India, the Ertiga Diesel’s fuel consumption is rated at 24.52 km/l in the local cycle. \nExterior-wise, the Ertiga Diesel, which will be fully imported to Indonesia from India, looks pretty much identical to the petrol models, with the exception of Hybrid badging at the rear. Inside, a beige steering wheel and gearlever (Indonesian petrol models get brown items, like ours) mark it out, as well as different fabric trim that is carried over from the Indian-market models. \nAdded kit over the petrol models include a manual-dimming rear-view mirror and a rear demister (yes, really), as well as a heater (this being Indian-spec). However, the Indonesian diesel model misses out on certain items that are offered on the range-topping models sold in India, including keyless entry, push-button start, a Bluetooth-enabled touchscreen infotainment system and a reverse camera. \nSo, how would a diesel Proton Ertiga sound? \nGALLERY: Suzuki Ertiga facelift at GIIAS 2015 Research Suzuki Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:00:12.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
