They're juggling a million things and they're desperate to feel energized. \nIf there was only one tip I could give to anyone else for the rest of my life, it would be to dive into self-care. \nSo many of us walk through life reacting, rather than being proactive. Where they’re racing from one thing to the next, checking off their to-do list, taking care of everything and everyone else but themselves; in turn they feel burned out. \nSelf-care helps us slow down while giving our bodies, minds, and spirits the attention they need from us. When we nurture ourselves, we tap into the energy that's always inside of us. From this place we're able to lean in and listen to the power of our intuition, allowing it to guide our decisions, which increases our clarity and our confidence on a daily basis. \nIn general, we're more calm, present, and trusting when we have a regular self-care practice. We're in tune with our needs and how to fulfill them, which encourages us to take care of ourselves so we can show up to life in a way we're proud of. ADVERTISEMENT \nHere are a few other benefits of having a regular self-care practice: We can listen with an open heart and mind. We know how to thrive on a daily basis. We're a more loving friend, spouse, sibling, and parent. We're more compassionate with ourselves and others. We're more efficient and have WAY more energy. \nSo, how should you take your self-care practice to the next level? \nChoose whatever makes you feel most vibrant, alive, and nurtured. \nHere are a few tools that help me prioritize self-care: 1. A journal \nWrite whatever you feel inspired to write—your thoughts, your dreams, to vent, to ask for clarity—pretty much dump whatever you have going on in that mind of yours onto paper so you can create space in your mind. 2. Essential oils \nI have oils diffusing at home all day long in every room. The energy they carry, the healing properties they have, and the vibe they can create is incredible. I like my home to smell like a spa, so it feels serene. 3. Rosewater \nThis is heaven in a bottle. I love to spray rosewater on my face and body shortly after I wake up. I also spray it throughout the day to keep me feeling vibrant and energized. It reduces the appearance of skin imperfections, is emotionally uplifting, and promotes a healthy complexion. 4. An indulgent cookbook \nI always feel inspired to get creative in the kitchen after flipping through one of my favorite cookbooks. I believe food is medicine, so I fill the fridge with nutritious options to give us energy throughout the day. 5. A handheld massager \nI love The Tapping Pro . It can work out kinks on any part of your body. It helps me relax and unwind after the day and it's a great way to slow down my nervous system without having to go get a massage. \nSince becoming a mom, my self-care routine has changed quite a bit. I used to have hours in the morning to meditate, visualize, journal, read, do yoga, eat a leisurely breakfast, take my time getting ready, and THEN get to work. It turns out, babies aren't so interested in that kind of morning. So, I changed up the way I viewed self-care and the way I incorporated it into my life. \nNow, I meditate for at least five minutes—15 if I can. I do my visualizations, say my thanks, then get out of bed and get my party started. \nI sprinkle different acts of self-care throughout my day and they make me feel fantastic, grounded, and nurtured. They don't take a lot of time. I've realized it's quality over quantity. Learning to be flexible in your timing makes it all doable. \nI often hear people say they don't have time for self-care. You CAN find five minutes somewhere in your day. Start there. I think you'll be amazed at the difference it can make. \nThis isn't about being perfect. It's about nurturing and loving yourself, so you can feel in tune with who you are and how you want to interact with the world. Prioritize little acts of self-care and feel refreshed, revived, and ready to take on whatever challenges come your way.
