But the state's attorney, Katherine Rundle, is refusing to charge any of them for the murder. This blatant disregard for human life on the part of Rundle is horrifying. We must demand she is recalled. Darren Rainey is the schizophrenic man who was incarcerated for possession of cocaine and then locked in a shower of 180 degrees until he died. The four officers who put him in there laughed, saying \"is it hot enough?\", while keeping the door shut. Once he died and was pulled out, nurses said burns were over 90% of his body and his skin was falling off at the touch. How could anyone look at this information and think these corrections officers didn't deserve to be charged? It's worth noting that this state's attorney has also never charged an officer for an on-duty shooting, although there have been questionable instances of such. When a mentally ill, incarcerated person cannot be protected by the state, we must speak out! Please sign the demand Rundle is recalled immediately!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T00:18:22.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
