Instagram \nRuth wants to share her feelings in the hope it will help other mums who are struggling to adapt. \nShe shared a candid photo of her cesarean section scars and stretch marks, writing: 'I followed SO many pregnant models during my pregnancy. \n'And when they photographed themselves pool-side 5 minutes postpartum, I thought, \"wow! I hope that happens to me!\"' Instagram \n'I took this picture a few days after I gave birth, when my PPD (post-partum depression) really first reared its head into my life. \n'I took this and actually was horrified. I couldn't believe it was me. I'm sharing it because I know in my heart that there are people out there that struggle with inadequacy. Instagram \n'That might think they are not beautiful, that they might be ruined, less worthy, or not good enough. \n'Yours might not actually be physical scars, but maybe, a failed relationship, a difficulty in your career, a mental struggle, money issues, or just feeling lost in life. Instagram \n'Be kind to yourself. And know that you are not alone. Comparison is the thief of joy.' \nShe then begged mums not to let social media 'taint' their view of what is real - and offered her support to those who are struggling, saying she has an 'open inbox'. \nIf you are struggling, there is support available on the PANDAS Foundation website.
