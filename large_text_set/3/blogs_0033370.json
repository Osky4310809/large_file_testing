It’s called “Halfway Home.” \nKevin Drew went on SiriusXMU earlier today to talk about the song and the record’s progress: “It’s been 17 years together as a band, and you just pick up where you left off. It’s always been that way. We’ve been working on this album on and off for the last year, and we thought that, since we’re an anthemic band, we wanted to bring the celebration with this first song.” \nHe continued: “We wanted this to be unity, and we wanted this record to be all of us. And that’s what it is. At this time and in the state of the world as it is, the one thing we knew we could do is come back as friends. […] It was important for all of us to come together because it’s the only thing we can politically do at this moment in time…” \nThe album is finished and being mastered, and Drew says that it’ll be out soon. But, for now, listen to BSS’ first new song in seven years below. \nHere’s a portion of Drew’s interview on SiriusXMU: \nBroke Social Scene will be joined on Colbert tonight by Metric’s Emily Haines and James Shaw and Stars’ Amy Milan and Evan Cranley (all longtime BSS members/associates).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-31T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T01:39:07.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
