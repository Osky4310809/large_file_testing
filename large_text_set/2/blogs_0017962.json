Here goes... \nWhy is Nerlens Noel gone for 2 average players and an average pick when WE STILL HAVE JAHLIL OKAFOR ON THE ROSTER. Sorry. #TrustTheProcess \n— Jake Smith (@Dylsm) February 23, 2017 \nWell then. Let's see what else comes along... \n\"We will not make a bad trade\" Colangelo states before trading Nerlens Noel for two second round picks. What a lieing dope of a GM \n— Ryan Tag (@RyanTag1) February 23, 2017 \nNerlens Noel went for the same as Ilyasova. That's that's alarmingly bad value Bry Colang. \n— Tall Guy (@dunk_sauce) February 23, 2017 \nQuestion for @Sixers - Are you announcing @thenorthface as your next sponsor, because Bryan Colangelo got fleeced. #TrustTheProcess \n— Ronnie Pasceri (@RonPasceri) February 23, 2017 \nBut I thought people didn't like Sam Hinkie? Or at least, that's what I've been told so often? Could it be that... he was right? \nI'm just saying @samhinkie most definitely did not die for THIS. \n— DJ Roomba (@Rundjc24) February 23, 2017 \n. @samhinkie please come back \nSam Hinkie was ridiculed for turning bad players into second-round picks. \nBryan Colangelo is turning good players into second-round picks. \n— Zach Harris¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (@ZachGHarris) February 23, 2017 \nIf you were wondering how fast Bryan Colangelo would ruin everything Sam Hinkie worked towards, we've got our answer #TradeDeadline https://t.co/mg5eababyE \n— Jordan Marryott (@JMarryott23) February 23, 2017 \nEven the Philadelphia Police are annoyed with the trade. \nHello, @DallasPD - Can I report a theft? \nHere's another way to put it: Click here for a live list of Twitter search results for the phrase \"Colangelo fleeced.\" The list is long. I wonder if that means anything.
