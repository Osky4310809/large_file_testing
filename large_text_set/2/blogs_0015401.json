TMZ provided footage of the aftermath (warning: explicit language) : As TMZ also noted, the speaker's words in the video closely align with the witness' complaint of what Revis allegedly said. The 31-year-old was charged with four felonies and a misdemeanor, including two counts of aggravated assault, per Austin Knoblauch of NFL.com. Revis turned himself in to authorities Friday and was later released, per the Associated Press . He has a court date set for this Thursday. According to his attorney, at least five people assaulted Revis, and he \"feared for his safety.\" The veteran is two years into a five-year deal signed with the Jets before the 2015 season. While he was a Pro Bowl player in his first season back in green, his production on the field dropped significantly in 2016. Cameron DaSilva of FoxSports.com noted the former All-Pro is owed $15.3 million next season, but $9.3 million can be saved if New York decides to cut him.
