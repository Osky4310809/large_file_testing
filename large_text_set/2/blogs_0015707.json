You drink, you puke, you drink again. It’s science! So, of course things once thought dead and gone, have a tendency to reappear whether they should or not. Case in point, 90’s “alcoholic sprite” as my other underage friends called it, is heading back to shelves. \nThat’s right, MillerCoors just announced they’re bringing the refreshingly terrible beverage back to your favorite dive bar. Now comes the dilemma: you want to take advantage of $1 Zima night, but you just don’t hate yourself quite enough to suffer like that. Never fear fellow boozehounds, here are a few ways to make your Zima a little more tolerable. Unfortunately, you’re still going to hate yourself the next morning. 2 \nJolly Rancher \nTake two 90’s favorites and throw them together and you get something a little more than tolerable. Jolly Ranchers hard candy was made for this, they just didn’t know it. Just drop one in and give it a few minutes. Flavor to the rescue! I highly recommend watermelon or sour apple. 3 \nCold Blood \nYour bartender is going to love this one. Ask him to take that two-day old juice at the bottom of the maraschino cherry container and pour it into your Zima. Not only will he respect you for life, he won’t expect a tip.* \n*Not all of these statements have been evaluated by a professional. 4 Jun OHWADA/Flickr \nGeneration X \nThat’s you! Why else would you do this to yourself? We are doing an around the world of beverage modding here. You need an ounce each of tequila, whisky, orange liqueur, blue curacao and melon liquor. Add all that sh*t to an accommodating glass, maybe something with Transformers on it, and then pour in the Zima. Seriously though, I’m sorry. 5 \nZimartini \nOk, this is what you came here for. Zima is the king of faux cocktails. Sip “martinis” all night with this hack. Chicks love a man who can pound martinis. Pour a shot of chilled vodka into your martini glass and top with a bottle of Zima. Boom! I can’t help you with that walk of shame though. You know you earned it.

Seriously though, if you try this, please let me know so I can contact your loved ones and apologize. You WILL feel this. You’ve been warned. Pour ½ oz. of gin, vodka and Cuban rum into a shaker. Do a little dance for me. Strain over ice. Top with a bottle of Zima and a few ounces of lemonade. \nIf you have any of these, you’re liable to make it into Mac’s wasted gallery. Don’t be shy.
