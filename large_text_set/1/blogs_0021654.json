His mother doesn’t want to medicate him, but no other treatment has worked. \n“We’ve tried meditation, relaxation, things like that,” Silvana Ferrer said. \nShe says he has trouble focusing in school, but she’s optimistic hypnosis will finally help him. \n“I’m hoping for the teachers not to call me anymore,” Ferrer said. “Everybody calls me hypno mom.” \nHypnotherapist Lisa Machenberg said she’s hypnotized close to 1,000 children, including her own. \n“I started hypnotizing the children at 7 months to sleep quickly, calmly, soundly and deeply all through the night,” Machenberg said. \nShe later hypnotized them to do better at sports and in school. \nShe said she’s essentially teaching Eric to hypnotize himself, to help him when he’s facing a challenging task. \nAfter his session, a short homework session went well, and Eric hopes that continues. \n“I hope it will help me because tomorrow, I have a lot of division and a lot of tests on math,” he said. \nMachenberg said parents already control their children and there’s a power to be harnessed. \n“Let’s learn how to use hypno-parenting to consciously influence our children to be more peaceful in the house, to have focused concentration,” she said. \nPsychologist Dr. Sanam Hafeez said putting kids in a trance is going too far and shouldn’t take the place of good parenting skills. \n“The idea is not to gain control of your child’s mind, but it’s to teach them what’s right, what’s appropriate, what’s desirable, so they can have control over their own mind,” she said. \nMental health experts also caution child hypnosis is more appropriate to treat conditions such as extreme pain or bed-wetting – as well as serious trauma, such as the loss of a parent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T02:00:40.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
