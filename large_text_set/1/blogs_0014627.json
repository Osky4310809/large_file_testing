This trick will keep your “lost pet” flyers up longer so you have a better chance of finding your furry friend. \nAfter you’ve printed a bunch of flyers with your pet’s picture, name, and your contact information on them, get a few of them laminated. It’s too expensive to laminate every flyer you make, but you can protect a few them and place them on high traffic street corners in your neighborhood. The plastic will keep rain from blurring the ink or melting the paper, and the staples will hold to the plastic laminate better than if it were just paper. Bonus tip: if you see a “lost pet” flyer in your neck of the woods, take a photo of it with your smartphone. That way if you do run into a cat or dog that seems lost, you’ll know for certain if it’s the right one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T02:18:15.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
