He can make us laugh on an off-screen. But he’s also spectacular as a lead in all sorts of non-comedic roles.\nWhat is surprising, however, is learning that Chris Pratt thinks sports taught him more about acting than anything else. During a recent interview with Vanity Fair , Pratt opened up about all sorts of experiences on his way to superstardom. The well-rounded man is taking some much-needed time off from filming at the moment. Since he had an incredible year of nonstop work and nonstop hits, it’s fair to say he’s earned it.\nA photo posted by chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) on Jan 3, 2017 at 1:57pm PST \nAt one point, Pratt talked about playing football when he was younger.\nTo nobody’s surprise, he excelled at the sport. He said, “I was a great football player. Don’t say I said that. But, dude, I was a great football player. I was a fullback and an inside linebacker. I never had the speed to play college. But I loved it.” \nThen he got specific about what it was about football that related so much to his future career in acting.\n“The competition, the team. You get a little bit of that in acting. You get it with action films. You have to train, be in shape. I think I learned more about how to handle myself as an actor playing sports than I ever did in theater,” Pratt said. Since Pratt trained to be in crazy good shape for his breakout role in Guardians of the Galaxy , it’s totally understandable he found his athletic background helpful.\nIt’s makes sense that being a good athlete is necessary to do all the crazy stunts he does in every action movie he’s in. Plus, working together in an ensemble setting like a movie or TV show is probably a lot like a sports team. So we can absolutely see where he’s coming from.\nAnd now we have even more motivation to join a recreational league as part of our New Year’s Resolutions.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:14:27.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
