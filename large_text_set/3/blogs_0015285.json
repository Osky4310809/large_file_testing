But in what ways do successful people invest? 1. Invest in Learning \nThere are so many ways in today’s world that you can learn. By investing time and not money you can increase your knowledge of any subject instantly. For the readers out there, use Goodreads to keep track of books you're interested in and those you have read. There are many inexpensive classes in various topics, or you can even find some free seminars at some local colleges. Netflix is perfect for great documentaries from food to finance. And don’t be afraid to reach out to a potential mentor, the worst thing that will happen is they will say no. 2. Invest in People \nI recently read the book Give and Take , a great read by the way. Here is a link to the book , I highly recommend it. Studies have shown that you are happier when you invest in others. Be a giver and see the beauty of giving back to our world that has given us so much. There are many non-profits, charities and mentorship programs that allow you to do this. Using your gifts to help others provides ancillary benefits to your personal growth and success. It’s also extremely fulfilling to give back. 3. Invest Your Savings \nObviously, as a financial advisor, I am going to encourage you to invest, but I also know many people don’t have extra money ready to invest. Myself, like others, are able to help you (for a monthly fee) create a plan for your investments and more importantly create a personal financial plan for you to pay off debt and become financially independent. By investing your money now you are making it easier for your future self to become successful. (For related reading from this author, see: 10 Common Habits That Can Increase Wealth .) 4. Invest in Your Family and Significant Others \nBeing successful for me means taking the time to invest in my wife and daughters. I know that they each need me in different ways and at different times. Same with your fiance, girlfriend or boyfriend, these relationships should take priority because our significant others will help us become successful. They will encourage us while we are down and will be our cheerleaders when we succeed. 5. Invest in Yourself \nTake time for yourself to reflect on your goals and what you want to do with your life. You can do this with personality tests that can help you understand how you interact with others and how you function. You can also take retreats to let your mind wander and reflect on where you are and where you want to be going. There are many paths to choose from, especially when we are young, that all lead us to different goals. This is why it is so important to take the time one needs do understand ourselves, our motives and our beliefs that form our goals. \nThere are many ways to invest your time and money. Don’t be afraid to invest in things that your heart is telling you. Take the time you need to become your best self. It is well worth it.
