By Renae Merle By Renae Merle January 25 at 9:37 AM Follow @renaemerle The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded above 20,000 for the first time on Jan. 25, resuming a rally that began in the wake of President Trump's election victory. (Reuters) \nNEW YORK — The closely watched Dow Jones industrial average reached historic levels Friday, breaching 20,000 points for the first time in a week when President Trump began to put his agenda in place. \nShortly after the election, investors dubbed a surge in stock prices the “Trump rally,” pushing U.S. stocks to new heights in anticipation that the new president would work with the Republican-led Congress to lower taxes and pass more business-friendly policies. But just as the Dow appeared ready to breach the 20,000 threshold, there was a retreat. [ Trump seeks to revive Dakota Access, Keystone XL oil pipelines ] \nThen, this week, as Trump vowed to rewrite trade agreements and revive pipelines, the markets began to rev again. \nFor the Dow, an index of 30 large publicly traded companies, topping the 20,000 level holds more symbolic than practical value. But Wall Street has been anticipating the rise could give investors the psychological boost to keep stock prices climbing even further. \nThe broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index have also been trading at record levels. The recent run-up in stock prices has added about $1 trillion in market value since the election to companies that make up the S&P 500. [ Jan. 7: What’s really important about China’s stock market disaster, and what’s not ] \nStocks staged a remarkable rebound in 2016, starting the year with massive sell-offs as investors worried about China’s rocky economy and falling oil prices and then panicked when Britain voted to leave the European Union. \nEach sell-off was followed by a recovery that pushed stock prices back into positive territory. After sagging as much as 10 percent in 2016, the Dow jumped 13 percent for the year, more than half of the rise coming since the election. The S&P was up about 10 percent last year, while the Nasdaq grew about 9 percent. \nThe markets’ rise “becomes self-fulfilling momentum,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist for the investment firm Wunderlich. “Whether you’re an individual or an institution you start chasing momentum.” [ Federal Reserve raises interest rates for second time in a decade ] \nBut, some market analysts say, stock prices may have already risen too far too fast. Investors are ignoring potential stumbling blocks that lie ahead for the U.S. economy, including that the Federal Reserve is beginning to raise interest rates — it bumped up a key lending rate last week, a move that traditionally has added costs for businesses. And it is unclear whether Trump will be able to implement all of his campaign promises, including lowering corporate taxes. \nThe rise in stock prices has also coincided with a sell-off in the bond market, a traditional safe haven during economic turbulence. The interest rate on a 10-year government note has risen from about 1.7 percent before the election to about 2.4 percent recently as investors demand a bigger return in exchange for locking up their money for a long period.
