Your time has finally come. After years of languishing on the vine, Google has finally updated its phone service with a new look and some new features for its Android, iOS, and web clients. Advertisement \nThe biggest update is the design. The new Google Voice looks modern, sleek, and consistent across all of its apps. The inbox now has tabs for texts, calls, and voicemails. Voice also now supports group messaging and MMS for all carriers. Finally. You can also reply to messages from the notification. If you’re using Google Voice inside the Hangouts app, you can keep using that app, as well. \nGoogle says that it plans to keep Voice updated from now on. That’s a hard promise to accept at face value for those of us who gave up hope years ago . Still, it’s nice to finally see the faithful rewarded and hopefully Google will stick to the plan this time. The updates are rolling out now and should hit all users “in the coming weeks.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T19:41:42.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
