I can't wait. This is wonderful!\" Prins said. And that was before the makeover! First up was Kim Prins from Arlington, Vermont. The 44-year-old mom of two commutes for three hours every day to take care of nursing home residents across the state, and has very little time for herself.\nPrins' husband didn't seem to know what to expect, but her daughter Kylie was so excited for her mom to get a makeover!\nNathan Congleton / TODAY Prins looks stunning in this figure-flattering dress! And, boy, did the Ambush team deliver! Hairstylist Arsen Gurgov cut off just a few inches to give Prins' hair even more body. Licari added more contrast to her blond hair by keeping her bold highlights and adding depth at the base for a softer, polished look.\nRELATED: 'Patti LaBelle, step back!' See the Ambush Makeover that left a friend stunned\nMartin completed the transformation by dressing Prins in a form-fitting dress and black pumps. The different textures of the dress only help to accentuate her figure!\nNext up is Emy Rubio from Chicago, Illinois.

Rubio stepped out in a suede motorcycle jacket that Martin selected because it's soft enough to almost read as a blazer. Martin paired the look with slim dark-wash jeans and pointed pumps.\nRELATED: 'Thank you so much!' Woman's friends burst into tears after seeing her makeover\nLicari decided to take Rubio's hair a few notches lighter, but still made sure it complimented her gorgeous skin tone. Gurgov trimmed off a few inches and added feathery layers right at the jawline to accentuate her beautiful face.\n\"You look so hot!\" Hoda Kotb told Rubio.\nNeedless to say, Rubio's daughter was stunned by her mom's new appearance, too!\nTODAY Someone get her some tissues! \"She looks amazing,\" Melissa said. \"I want to go next!\"\nCongratulations to both ladies on their fabulous makeovers!
