Kim's got her own show on Bravo that just started filming ... and NeNe's shooting her own stuff.\nWe're told Bravo's willing to bend if necessary and hire them as part-time cast members, although that's not ideal. \nWe know both want a lot of money, and we don't know if the 2 sides are far apart.\nKim hasn't been a regular on 'Housewives' since season 5, and NeNe bailed after season 8. Members of the existing cast are not all down with the move, but they have no choice.\nWelcome back, girls ... maybe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T10:06:09.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
