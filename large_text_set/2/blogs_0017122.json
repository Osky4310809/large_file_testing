In fact, Monday’s episode was reminiscent of when Kristen slept with best friend Stassi's then boyfriend-Jax and subsequently spent episode after episode playing the blame game to justify her actions. \nDespite Kristen managing to piss off nearly every single cast member at least once over the last five years of the show, Vanderpump told TooFab she still has room for her in her heart. \n\"I actually do love each and every one of them -- even Kristen -- because you’ve got to be quite ready to put your life out there and then be committed to the show,” she said. \"Now, does she irritate the f--k out of me? Yes, she does. Have I wanted to strangle her? Yes, I have. But I have a deep affection for all of them because they’ve been part of the whole kind of journey that we’ve all kind of embarked on. And you’ve got to be brave. \n\"You’ve gotta have some gut to do a reality show, and I think they've committed to it,\" she added. \"They’ve committed to being honest even about their dishonesty. Jax talking about stealing sunglasses and how they’ve been dishonest in their relationships when they’ve been screwing somebody else. So their honesty to the viewer and the cohesion they all have together is the glue of the show.” \nSee more: Inside 'Real Housewives' Star Lisa Vanderpump's New Passion Project Vanderpump Dogs (Exclusive) \nThe two notorious \"Vanderpump\" players who were obviously not invited to the New Orleans group getaway were Lala Kent ( who exited the show midseason ) and James Kennedy. \nWhen asked for her thoughts on Lala, Vanderpump said: \"Lala’s no angel, let’s not get this twisted. I mean, she threw out enough at Katie Mahoney... Some you saw, some you didn’t see about Schwartz and everything, but Katie has born the brunt of it. But Lala – she’s been erratic, she’s been undependable, so to speak, she’s made mistakes, and she hasn't been totally transparent about what her life has been. And I think that’s probably irritating to some of her cast members. But she’s got a great quality about her, and I think she makes for great reality television.” \nSee more: The Real Reason Behind Lala Kent's Exit From 'Vanderpump Rules' (Exclusive Details) \nAs far as James Kennedy, Vanderpump still has hope for him. \n\"He's an obnoxious little tw-t, but that's when he’s drunk. When he's sober, he's actually quite a decent human being and somebody that I do have a lot of time for. But just like when he has a drink, fur grows on the inside of his palms. He literally turns into the devil. So I don’t have a lot of patience for that, and I kept kind of reminding him that drinking was unacceptable in the business, and he would think, 'Well, if I don’t go to the bar, it wouldn’t really count.' Like if customers bought him drinks, things like that. He has to grow up before he can come back, but I do have a lot of time for him.\" \nBut more importantly we had to ask what Vanderpump thought of Kennedy calling himself \"the White Kanye West.\" \n\"That’s a brave statement,\" she said. \n\"Vanderpump Rules\" airs Monday nights on Bravo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:18:01.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
