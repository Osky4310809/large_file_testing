'Drones should be banned from sky near airports' \n\"The aircraft was safely escorted to Birmingham International Airport.\" \nA Birmingham Airport spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that a private Saab 340 aircraft inbound from Bucharest to Birmingham and carrying three crew encountered communication difficulties during a flight earlier today. \n\"In accordance with normal operating procedures the aircraft was intercepted by military jets on arrival into UK airspace and was escorted up to its scheduled arrival into Birmingham.\" \nThe RAF has Typhoon pilots on standby 24 hours a day to defend UK air space which can be launched within minutes to intercept aircraft. \nCauses for concern could be Russian military aircraft or civilian planes which have stopped communicating with air traffic control or have sent an emergency signal. \nMinistry of Defence figures show emergency response planes were launched on 12 days in 2015, eight in response to Russian aircraft and four to investigate other planes.
