However, the fees would be brought down to the level of Rs 4-5 lakh for startups who are into the cyber security niche.\nMore details are awaited…\nDownload Free Anti-Virus Tools As of now, there exists 5 major anti-virus and malware removal tools, which can be instantly downloaded by any user in India.\nThe most prominent among them is Free Bot Removal Tool , which would be provided in association with QuickHeal.
