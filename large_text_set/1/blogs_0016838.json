In a statement released to the media, Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that the Philippines and the US can have a \"placid and mutually beneficial relationship\" as longtime allies. \"Our diplomatic ties need to reflect our long-standing relationship but under terms and conditions that protect our people's interests,\" Abella said. Relations between the Philippines and the US have been strained in recent months, especially over concerns raised by the Obama administration over potential human rights violations in the Philippine government's campaign against illegal drugs. President Rodrigo Duterte has announced that the Philippines will seek an independent foreign policy and closer ties with China, Russia and with Asian neighbors. He has also announced the country's \"separation\" from the US, its former colonizer and longtime ally. Trump said Friday night (Manila time) that his administration \"we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\" He said that the US does not \"seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.\" Trump, who has promised more protectionist policies for the US, said that he will bring jobs that have been outsourced to other countries back to the US. \"Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength,\" he said. Abella said that better relations with the US are possible but also said that the Philippines will continue to strengthening ties with \"other friends and partners in the international community.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T12:36:03.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
