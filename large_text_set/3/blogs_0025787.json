(Murton's Citybus) \nTim Williams is an accredited manager and director of Murtons and has been with the company since 1985. \nMr Williams said it was sad to let go but it was time to move on, and cited tight bus regulations as a reason for selling assets to Buslink Sunraysia. \n\"It's a complicated thing, operating buses,\" Mr Williams said. \n\"There's an awful lot of regulatory stuff involved in safety, both for the passengers and also making sure that the buses are roadworthy. \n\"We've done everything correctly over the years but it becomes a very complicated thing and I think a larger group have got better resources to look after that. \n\"Both the directors, myself and Brian Coucill, are fairly old and we thought it's about time to hand on. \n\"You can't go on forever. I'd just like some spare time ... so that myself and my wife can enjoy our retirement.\" Photo: Buslink, which will take over from Murton's, plans to bring new buses and services to Broken Hill. (Murton's Citybus) \nMr Williams said he was confident far west residents would be in good hands under Buslink when it took over from December 31. \n\"They're keeping all the staff, and doing the things the way we want to do it, except with a bit more resources than we would have had,\" Mr Williams said. \nBuslink also has some ideas of its own, including procuring a few new buses and settling in at a new bus depot. \nManaging director Sam Lucas said Buslink was also looking at expanding services and routes. \n\"Clearly the two obvious ones will be [between] Adelaide and Broken Hill and Mildura [and] Broken Hill,\" Mr Lucas said. \n\"Whether we do those separately or together or how that might look, that is something we'll definitely be having a look at.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:14:42.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
