In the post, Frank accused his dad of using a homophobic slur years and years ago ... when Frank was a kid.\nFrank recalled, \"I was 6 years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f****t as he dragged me out of a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn't be served because she was dirty.\"\nCalvin calls the story BS and says it's damaged his financial opportunities in film and music.\nHe wants his son to fork over $14.5 million in damages.\nCalvin also sued Russell Simmons in 2014 for claiming he was a deadbeat dad . That lawsuit was for $142 million.\nSounds like Frank's getting a friends and family discount.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:36:00.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
