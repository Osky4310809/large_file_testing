It seems that we have our very own thought police: the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. \nFortune tellers, product placement and alcohol advertising during sporting events all come under scrutiny in the BAI's latest regulatory guidelines. \nAs part of its new Commercial Communications Code, the BAI has drawn up a list of rules broadcasters must comply with when it comes to airing advertising and sponsorship. \nIt is the first time the guidelines have been substantially revised since 2010 and they will be implemented on June 1, 2017. \nProduct placement is one area that underwent revision. Under 2010 guidelines, the BAI stated a programme qualified as containing product placement if it featured over €5,000 worth of products or services in a single episode. \nThis figure has been reduced substantially to €1,000. Some independent producers have said given the high production costs in making content, this could cause complications. Alcohol advertising during sporting events will come under scrutiny in the BAI’s latest regulatory guidelines \n\"It could make things tricky,\" Stuart Switzer of Coco Television Productions said. \"Five thousand was a definable amount. It's a significant drop down and potentially another administrative difficulty for production companies.\" \nRTÉ, which uses product placement heavily in programmes such as 'Fair City' and 'The Late Late Show', doesn't think it will present a problem. \nAn RTÉ spokesperson said the broadcaster is subject to \"no limitations to how much product placement support it can receive\". \nHowever, the spokesperson said product placement will not impact the integrity of its programming. They cited the Spar store which features in Fair City saying it \"works as a credible part of life in Carrigstown\" and does not compromise the editorial integrity of the soap.

For example, the terms and conditions spiel that features on financial services radio ads will no longer count towards advertising air time. \nIt was decided that racing through T&C's at breakneck speed was not comparable to having a disclaimer in small font at the bottom of a TV ad. Lots of areas are touched upon in the extensive document but it remains to be seen if there will be any visible changes on our TV screens.
