You want political correctness? They have enough to spare. You want hysterically oversensitive faculty and students? No problem. You want spineless administrators who fail to stand up for academic freedom and against tyrannical teachers? Look no further.\nA student at Rollins, Marshall Polston, a 20 year old Christian, confronted his \"professor\" of Middle Eastern Humanities who asserted that Jesus Christ was not crucified. He also told his class that his 12 apostles did not believe in Christ's divinity.\nMr. Polston decided to confront his teacher, Areej Zufari, and before he knew it, he was not only suspended but banned for stepping foot on campus.\nCollege Fix:\n“Honestly, it reminded me of some of the more radical groups I researched when abroad,” Polston told the Central Florida Post about his professor’s comments on Jesus.\n“Whether religious or not, I believe even those with limited knowledge of Christianity can agree that according to the text, Jesus was crucified and his followers did believe he was divine… that he was ‘God,’” he continued. “Regardless, to assert the contrary as academic fact is not supported by the evidence.”\nPolston, in a message to The College Fix on Saturday, said he stands behind his assertions in the Post article. He said he is upset he was suspended and has hired an attorney.\n“Our university should be a place where free-speech flashes and ideas can be spoken of without punishment or fear of retribution,” Polston told The College Fix . “In my case it was the total opposite. … I came forward with the story because I know so many other students like me suffer under today’s liberal academic elite.”\nif Mr. Polston's travails had ended there, we could chalk it up as just another example of collegiate political correctness run amok. But the story gets even more bizarre:\nPolston claims the situation began after he challenged Zufari’s assertions about Jesus and his disciples. Polston said this challenge led Zufari to file a complaint with a campus dean, claiming he made her feel “unsafe.”\nNext, Polston received a 52 percent on a major essay.\n“I was upset, understandably. I’ve never gotten anything less than straight A’s, so I was really interested in figuring out how to possibly improve or at least understand the grade,” Polston told the Post .\nOn another day during the course, Zufari led a discussion about the application of Sharia Law. Polston claims that during this discussion, a male Muslim student said gays and adulterers should be beheaded under Sharia Law.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/faith/2017/03/28/christian-student-suspended-after-challenging-muslim-profs-denial-of-christs-crucifixion/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.centralfloridapost.com/2017/03/25/rollins-college-suspends-student-after-he-challenged-radical-muslim-hate-speech/", "https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/31853/"], "published": "2017-03-28T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:43:40.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
