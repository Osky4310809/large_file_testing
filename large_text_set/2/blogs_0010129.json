Because anyone from anywhere can do anything, and this is that.”\nA few minutes later, while coming back from a commercial break, host James Corden also appeared sans-pants and quipped, “An odd coincidence, I always told myself that if I ever hosted the Grammys, I would also do it in my underwear. It’s quite an amazing coincidence.”\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ew.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:57:53.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
