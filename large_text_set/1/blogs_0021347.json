(Ted Richardson/AP)   \nA little birdie told him. \nPresident Trump’s assertion that the 2016 election was plagued by massive voter fraud stems in part from a German professional golfer, according to a report. \nThe commander-in-chief has claimed that millions voted illegally in November, and posted on Twitter that he is asking for a “major investigation” into it. \nThough many in his own party have said there is no evidence for such fraud, his claims reportedly are based on a conversation with “very famous golfer Bernhard Langer,” the New York Times reported Wednesday. Donald Trump in the White House \nThe newspaper reported that during a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday, Trump said that Langer told him of how he was not allowed to vote at a Florida polling station. \nTrump reportedly relayed that other voters who appeared to be of Latin American descent were allowed to cast provisional ballots. \nThe president’s supposed go-to evidence for massive electoral unfairness may be more full of holes than hole-in-one, however. Langer's daughter said that he is not friends with Trump. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) \nLanger, a two-time Masters champion, is a permanent Florida resident who remains a citizen of Germany and cannot legally vote in the U.S., his daughter told the Times. \nPresident Trump promises voter fraud investigation \n“He is not a friend of President Trump’s, and I don’t know why he would talk about him,” she said. \nA senior White House staffer told the Times that Langer told Trump the story over Thanksgiving in Florida, and that it actually refers to a friend of the golfer who could not vote. \nTrump lost November’s popular vote by almost 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, but won the electoral college with more than 300 electors.
