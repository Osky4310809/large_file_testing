While some OFWs were refunded these fees at the airport prior to their departure, most of them, however, were not refunded because of lack of awareness about this privilege or lack of time to process their claim for refund,” Bello noted. \nA copy of the letter was also provided to various airline companies operating in the Philippines. \nThe labor chief has also requested CAAP to remit the travel tax and terminal fees which were not refunded to the OFWs to the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).
