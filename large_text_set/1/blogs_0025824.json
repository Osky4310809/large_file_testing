He seems unlikely to be swayed, so this is really more gauntlet than letter that Senator Franken has sent his way. \nThe Senator wrote: \nAs Chairman, you have an obligation to protect Americans’ access to diverse information sources and to ensure that the internet remains a tool for American innovation, economic growth, and public discourse. I have no doubt that you recognize the significance of your new role, but your stated opposition to strong net neutrality rules raises serious concerns about your commitment to honoring the First Amendment. \nWhatever course Pai and his colleagues on the Commission choose to pursue, it won’t be a quick reversal. Wheeler’s order can’t just be rescinded overnight; action to replace it must be proposed, debated, and publicly commented on. The original order drew some 4 million comments, mostly positive (as Franken points out), and a replacement would likely draw a similar level of attention. \nThe FCC has a meeting tomorrow , but net neutrality and other serious issues may not even be brought up: the agenda is full of ordinary business like TV station licensing. But anything is possible these days, and we’ll be watching; it’ll be streamed live from the FCC’s website starting at 10:30 AM Eastern. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T03:06:53.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
