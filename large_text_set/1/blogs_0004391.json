This Space Invaders -themed backpack only looks like a miniature replica of an arcade machine—it doesn’t actually let you play the classic video game that has you fending off alien invaders. But we’ll happily turn a blind eye to that oversight, because everything else about this pack is fantastic. \nInside the backpack you’ll find countless pockets and compartments lined with a lovely polyester patterned print featuring images of the actual invaders, who also pop up as 3D rubber zipper pulls. And below the simulated screen on the back of the pack is a working quarter slot you can use to stash coins you don’t want bouncing around your pocket.
