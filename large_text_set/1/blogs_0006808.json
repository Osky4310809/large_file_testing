The New Year has only just begun and it’s already almost awards season! And if Emma Stone’s latest red carpet look — which masterfully incorporates nearly every 2017 fashion trend — is any indication, this year is going to be a great one for style.\nWearing a yellow flower-print dress from Gucci’s Spring/Summer 2017 collection at a W magazine event in Los Angeles this week, Emma showed off not one, not two, but three of this year’s top trends: ruffles ; one-shoulder tops; and bright prints.\nTo sum up: If this is what style in 2017 is going to look like, the fashion team here at HG is going to be very, very happy.\nDonato Sardella/Getty Images for W Magazine Isn’t she lovely ?\nEmma paired her gorgeous, summery frock with some striking pink metallic heels, also by Gucci, and carried a vibrant pink clutch from Italian designer Tyler Ellis. The overall look was elegant, light-hearted, and reminiscent of her bright yellow ensemble in La La Land. \nA photo posted by La La Land (@lalaland) on Dec 9, 2016 at 6:38pm PST \nEmma wasn’t the only La La Land -er spotted out in Gucci this week. Her dashing co-star, the one and only Ryan Gosling, stepped out at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in a sophisticated one-button Gucci tux from the brand’s Cruise 2017 collection.\nPrepare to feel your heart race, because he looks damn fine (as usual).\nA photo posted by Gucci (@gucci) on Jan 6, 2017 at 12:36pm PST \nLa La Land is currently in theaters nationwide and is expected to clean up at the Oscars this year, so be sure to sneak in a viewing before awards season has officially begun!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T00:08:39.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
