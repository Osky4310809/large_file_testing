Born in February 1952 at Ambala Cantonment, Haryana, politics ran parallel to her growing-up years. That this was going to be her life path was evident from the beginning, given that her father, Hardev Sharma, was a prominent Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh member. But let's not forget the state of women in the state of Haryana even today. Her achievements shine even brighter in that light. \nSwaraj (formerly Sharma) was educated at Sanatan Dharma College, and got her Bachelor's degree with majors in Sanskrit and Political Science. She then went on to study Law at Punjab University, Chandigarh. She won the ‘Best Hindi Speaker' award for three consecutive years at state-level while in college - which is where her powerful vernacular oratory skills come from. Incidentally, writing and reading poetry is one of her favourite hobbies. \nSwaraj started to practise as an advocate in the Supreme Court of India in 1973, but soon transitioned into the big bad world of Indian politics - a working space ever-so slightly hostile to women (at least back in the 70s-80s). She began her political career with ABVP (Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad) in the 1970s. Her husband, Swaraj Kaushal, was in socialist leader George Fernandes' camp, and Sushma naturally became a part of Fernandes's legal defence team in 1975. She also took part in Jayaprakash Narayan's legendary Total Revolution Movement. After the Emergency, she joined the BJP, later becoming the national leader of the BJP - and that's saying something! A leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Swaraj is the second woman to have become India's Minister of External Affairs (her current porfolio), after Indira Gandhi. She has been elected seven times as a Member of Parliament. At the age of 25 (in 1977), she became the youngest cabinet minister of the north Indian state of Haryana. She was also the 5th Chief Minister of Delhi in 1998 (albeit briefly). \nSwaraj has held numerous powerful positions through the years - Cabinet Minister, Labour and Employment, Government of Haryana; Cabinet Minister, Education, Food and Civil Supplies, Government of Haryana; Union Cabinet Minister, Information and Broadcasting; Union Cabinet Minister, Information and Broadcasting and Telecommunications (Additional charge); Minister of Information and Broadcasting; Minister of Health and Family Welfare and Minister of Parliamentary Affairs - among a handful other! Now that's one hell of a long and strong political career this lady can boast of. \nWhat is über cool about this politician is her engagement with Twitter - she's totally clued in and present on the microblogging site! Swaraj has often responded to tweets sent directly to her by Indians in distress abroad, and has intervened personally to help them. In fact, early this year, she said that she will personally monitor embassies' and other authorities' responses to calls for aid (vis-à-vis MEA)! So, if you're travelling abroad and need your local embassy's help - you know who to tweet! Sushma Swaraj \nSwaraj is known for her love of and keen interest in subjects of economy, defence and information. She loves Hindi poetry, classical music, drama and fine arts. We couldn't be happier for having such a super cool lady boss for our Union External Affairs Ministry! \nOh, did we mention she's in the Limca Book of Records? Well, she holds the distinction of being the youngest Cabinet Minister in Haryana; her husband holds the distinction of being the youngest Governor in India; and together, they've been adjudged as the ‘Distinguished Couple' in the Limca Book of Records. Viola! \nOn International Women's Day, here's more power to you, Ms Swaraj.
