Our mission is to ensure anyone wishing to peaceably exercise their First Amendment rights within the District of Columbia has a safe environment to do so, absent legal restrictions relating to the time, place, and manner of such activity. MPD’s use of BWC’s at First Amendment activities is not for the purpose of identifying and recording those persons present that are lawfully expressing protected speech, but rather it serves as an accountability tool for MPD management with respect to ensuring the proper conduct of members and the appropriate handling of policing functions at the scene.”\nEarlier this week , Monica Hopkins-Maxwell of the D.C. branch of the ACLU told reporters that \"the police shouldn't be able to surveil First Amendment activity.\" She argued that there were privacy concerns with the availability of body cameras. \"Who looks at that data? What's that data used for?\" she asked.\nAfter receiving a media backlash for telling police that their cameras would have to be turned off, the ACLU wrote on its website:\nIt’s not an ACLU “demand,” it’s actually DC law. True, the ACLU of DC supported and encouraged adoption of that law, but the wider District of Columbia community as represented by its city council agreed with us.\nHere is what the law in question says :\nMPD officers may record First Amendment assemblies for the purpose of documenting violations of law and police actions, as an aid to future coordination and deployment of law enforcement units, and for training purposes; provided, that recording First Amendment assemblies shall not be conducted for the purpose of identifying and recording the presence of individual participants who are not engaged in unlawful conduct.\nAs you can see, it doesn't say what the ACLU has been fraudulently claiming it says.\nThe law clearly allows officers to have their body cameras on at the protests -- just not for the purposes of identifying protesters engaged in lawful activity.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/01/19/d-c-police-will-have-their-body-cameras-on-during-protests-mpd-sources-say/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://bluelivesmatter.blue/dc-police-aclu-bodycam-inauguration-protests/", "https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/B21-0351-Body-Worn%20Camera%20Program%20Regulations.pdf"], "published": "2017-01-20T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T04:09:53.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
