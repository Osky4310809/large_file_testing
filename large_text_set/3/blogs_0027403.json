Emirates passenger planes at Dubai airport in United Arab Emirates. (Photo: Kamran Jebreili, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nA new “temporary” restriction, announced by the Department of Homeland Security, bans personal electronics larger than cellphones in the cabins of certain direct flights from the Middle East and Africa to the U.S. Facebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nThis is absurd. Terrorists can just take a flight to London, Paris or Rome and board a different airline that is not subject to the restriction. Whose brilliant idea was this? \n— Marc Rodstein \nThis is Muslim discrimination. To select a country that has a high population of Muslims and not allow them to bring their laptops and tablets with them is just wrong. \n— Peter Barone \nI guess it’s also discriminatory not to allow Muslims to have large electronics on a plane with them? Liberals will want to take this to court. \n— Thomas Davis \nIt’s odd that they can allow cellphones, presumably including iPhones, but not iPads. That suggests this has nothing to do with software, since they support the same applications. \n— Tyler Turner", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:27:39.955+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
