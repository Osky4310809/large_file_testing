But, if these press renders are real, Huawei is definitely swimming against the current. \nThe device is rumored to have a 5.2-inch screen and a Huawei Kirin 960 chipset, while the reports about RAM and storage are all over the place. One interesting rumor we're seeing is that the screen resolution will be increased from full HD (on the P9) to quad HD. The company could also launch two devices, with the larger, 5.5-inch one having a curved screen. \nHuawei will officially launch the P10 on Sunday, Feb. 26, in Barcelona, and Mashable will be there to cover the news. \nBONUS: This app helps the blind \"see\" by identifying objects around them", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:32:00.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
