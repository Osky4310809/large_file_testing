Retailing at RM159,900 , including GST but excluding road tax, insurance and registration, this touring machine is the epitome of big six-cylinder motorcycles. \nThe K 1600 GT’s power plant is now Euro 4 compliant, with new catalytic convertors, and puts out a claimed 160 hp at 7,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 175 Nm at 5,250 rpm. The inline-six engine is said to be the lightest in its class, at 102.6 kg, and comes with new engine mapping and a fuel system with carbon canister for fuel tank ventilation, cutting down on emissions. \nIntroduced worldwide last year in October, the 2017 K 1600 GT now comes standard with BMW Motorrad’s Dynamic ESA, standing for electronic suspension adjustment. This semi-active suspension borrows technology from BMW’s M-series cars – the internal valves are shared with the M3 and M4 – and provides optimum suspension damping in all riding states and regardless of load. \nThis gives the K 1600 GT two ride modes – the standard “Road” setting which gives optimum comfort and traction, and “Dynamic”, which provides a tighter damping setup. Modes can be changed with the press of a handlebar button, and spring pre-load can be adjusted independently of damping. \nMore convenience is given to the rider with the inclusion of reverse assist and Shift Assistant Pro. On the K 1600 GT, reverse assist is activated by pressing a switch on the left handlebar pod, and holding on the starter button, while Shift Assistant Pro allows for clutch-less up- and down-shifts, giving quicker gear changes and eliminating that “jerk” when the clutch is pulled. \nSetting off on the BMW K 1600 GT is with Keyless Ride, and starting and unlocking can be done with a button or using the transponder key. Adding to the ease of riding built into BMW’s big tourer is Hill Start Control, that allows the rider to stay in control when riding off on an incline without having to balance the brake and throttle. \nOn the right side of the fairing, a small lockable storage compartment conceals a USB charging port, while the instruments incorporate a colour TFT LCD screen along with a separate navigation system. The windscreen is an elecrically powered unit that raises and lowers at the touch of a button. \nThere are three colour options available for the 2017 BMW Motorrad K 1600 GT – Black Storm Metallic and Mars Red Metallic. The third option, Lupine Blue Metallic, sees the K 1600 GT’s drivetrain finished in black. Coming with diverse and extensive experience in heavy engineering, Mohan enjoys making anything with wheels go fast, especially motorcycles. His weapon of choice is the Desmoquattro engine, and he has a penchant for anything with a dash of Italian design. Strangely enough, he insists he's a slow rider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T06:39:27.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
