According to Parenting.com, approximately 37 children die each year when accidentally left in cars that quickly become overheated. \nThe device would attach to the top of a car seat. A sensor would detect if a child was left inside the vehicle and blow cool air onto the child until help arrived. \nCurry is still in the process of designing the Oasis, but he has a provisional patent, along with some interest from Toyota, where his father Bishop Curry IV works as an engineer. \n\"It would be a dream to have lots of inventions that would save many lives,\" Curry V told NBCWashington.com. \nThe younger Curry is raising money online to further his creation.
