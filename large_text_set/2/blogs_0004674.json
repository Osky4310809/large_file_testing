SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern talked about his old friend Donald Trump on his show this week, and he said that he’s worried the presidency will have a damaging effect on Trump’s mental well-being.\nTrump is known to be highly concerned about his public perception, and Stern said on Wednesday that he wasn’t sure what that will mean for Trump now that he will face presidential levels of scrutiny. Trump is still a subject of protests and relatively low approval ratings , and Stern said that he told the mogul that he didn’t think it would be “a healthy experience” getting involved in politics:\n“I personally wish that he had never run. I told him that because I actually think this is something that is going to be detrimental to his mental health…He really does want to be loved, he does want people to really love him, that drives him a lot. I think he has a very sensitive ego.”\nEven though Trump currently has a tense relationship with the press and various liberal celebrities, Stern suggested that Trump is more deeply wounded by the negativity than he lets on:\n“He’s now on this anti-Hollywood kick. He loves Hollywood. First of all, he loves the press. He lives for it. He loves people in Hollywood. He only wants hobnob with them. All of this hatred and stuff directed towards him. It’s not good for him. It’s not good. There’s a reason every president who leaves the office has grey hair.”\nThe shock jock went on to say that he still believes Trump used his campaign to boost The Apprentice , and that even now, Trump doesn’t actually want to be president:\n“He just wanted a couple more bucks out of NBC, and that is why Donald is calling for voter fraud investigations…He’s pissed he won. He still wants Hillary Clinton to win. He’s so f*cking pissed, he’s hoping that he can find some voter fraud and hand it over to Hillary.”\nStern spoke against Trump’s politics during the 2016 election, and his years of conversations with Trump were a source of controversy for the mogul on multiple occasions .\nYou can listen to the relevant clip here .\n[Image via screengrab]\n— —\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter\n ", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fhe-has-a-very-sensitive-ego-howard-stern-says-presidency-will-be-detrimental-to-trumps-mental-health%2F&layout=box_count&show-faces=false&action=like&width=51&font=arial&colorscheme=light", "http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article130475319.html", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fonline%2Fhe-has-a-very-sensitive-ego-howard-stern-says-presidency-will-be-detrimental-to-trumps-mental-health%2F&media=http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/trump-stern.jpg&description=%26%238216%3BHe%20Has%20a%20Very%20Sensitive%20Ego%26%238217%3B%3A%20Howard%20Stern%20Says%20Presidency%20Will%20be%20%26%238216%3BDetrimental%26%238217%3B%20to%20Trump%26%238217%3Bs%20Mental%20Health", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://twitter.com/KenMeyer91", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZUymflg8zY"], "published": "2017-02-04T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:10:11.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
