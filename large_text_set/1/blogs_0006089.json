FAKE NEWS – A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017 \nBuzzfeed followed up CNN’s report, which said Trump was given a two-page synopsis, by publishing a dossier that was the basis of the document given Trump. Buzzfeed noted that many of the claims in the doc were unverified and salacious. \nTrump’s special counsel, Michael Cohen, who was included in the dossier, also responded on Twitter to the document. I have never been to Prague in my life. #fakenews pic.twitter.com/CMil9Rha3D \n— Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) January 11, 2017 \nCohen also told Mic in an interview that “somebody is having a lot of fun at your expense” and that it’s “so ridiculous on so many levels.” \nHe also reiterated the claim that it was “fake news”: \n“At some point in time, this fake news nonsense needs to stop. We are talking about the president-elect of the United States of America, and if we want to portray an image of strength and intelligence throughout the world, we need to start acting intelligent,” he said. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T06:31:23.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
