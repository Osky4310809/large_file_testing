Painter Felice House’s work is straight up excellent, and this series is giving me life right now. (via Boing Boing )\nA new cartoon for the New Yorker is apparently pissing off more than a few men . It’s a pretty solid takedown of mansplaining, which, well, explains a lot, now doesn’t it? (via Boing Boing) Speaking of explaining things, apparently Mads Mikkelsen didn’t quite get the idea behind Death Stranding even after Hideo Kojima explained it to him . Oh well. Can’t wait for the game (and its inevitable analytic thinkpieces) to come out. (via Polygon) \nQi Yi, a baby panda at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding (wow, what a name for a research institute) perfectly captures what it’s like to be the clingy one in a relationship. But I don’t wanna let go , you can almost hear her say. (via Laughing Squid )\nJ.J. Abrams thinks Mark Hamill should get an Oscar for his work in The Last Jedi . I guess we can take that to mean he actually has lines this time around? (via CBR) Marvel just announced that they’ve found their Black Bolt to lead the forthcoming Inhumans television show they have planned. (via io9) Dang, yo. That’s a lot of stuff, especially considering the fact that the internet has been dead for most of today. What’d you see ( if anything at all )?\n(featured image via Instagram screengrab)\n— The Mary Sue has a strict comment policy that forbids, but is not limited to, personal insults toward anyone , hate speech, and trolling.— \nFollow The Mary Sue on Twitter , Facebook , Tumblr , Pinterest , & Google+ .
