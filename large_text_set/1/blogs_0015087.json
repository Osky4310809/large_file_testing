Working late \nThey claimed cuts were having a big impact on the workload of the support staff who remained - and affecting teachers and pupils. \nThe findings of the research include: Library hours, sports and lunch or after school clubs, music tuition and cleaning have all been cut The number of school librarians has been cut, making it harder to help children from deprived backgrounds; Support staff who remain in schools are skipping breaks and working late to cope with increased workloads; Six in 10 of those surveyed said morale was low. \nThe number of teachers in Scottish schools rose last year for the first time in several years, according to government figures. Councils are now obliged to maintain the ratio of teachers to students so cannot easily cut teacher numbers. \nHowever councils - which have faced years of tight budgets - still decide how much to spend on the education service overall and can decide how many staff are needed in other roles. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Unison said school libraries have suffered from cutbacks \nCarol Ball, the chairwoman of Unison's education committee said: \"Cutting hours and not replacing staff means job losses are less likely to get noticed outside school. But these cuts still damage our children's education inside school. \n\"Staff try to maintain a high quality service to give children the best start in life. But this is enormously difficult when schools are short of supplies and staff workloads continue to increase; and libraries, sports lunch and afterschool clubs and music tuition have been cut. And this hurts the poorest kids the most\" \nDave Watson, Unison regional manager, added: \"The Scottish government has targets to reduce inequality in educational outcomes. Sadly, it is children from the most deprived backgrounds that need the access to libraries, or help from librarians. They are less likely to have computers, printers or quiet warm places to do homework. \" \nLarry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) warned that the cuts would lead to an \"unsustainable situation\" where schools and staff were asked to achieve more with less. \n\"This leads to increased stress amongst staff, and the potential for associated health problems to emerge - which can then compound workload pressures due to staff illness,\" he said. \nAnalysis by BBC Scotland education correspondent Jamie McIvor \nCouncils have faced tough budgets for years. \nDramatic, controversial cuts have been relatively few and far between - councils argue they have tried their best to prioritise the most important local services including education. \nInstead, the impact of tight budgets has often been felt through so-called stealth cuts: cuts in budgets or staffing which may not have an immediately obvious impact, grab headlines or attract widespread public comment. \nThe effect of these stealth cuts tends to take two broad forms; either the remaining staff find their workload increases or work ends up not being done. \nSome may use evidence of stealth cuts as an argument that councils need more money or at least more freedom to raise money. \nOthers may argue individual councils are taking the wrong decisions or that it may be possible to find ways of delivering services more efficiently to make up for the impact of cuts or monetary pressure. \nThe survey comes as councils across Scotland deliberate over their budgets for the year ahead. \nCosla said Unison was \"absolutely right\" about the impact on-going cuts are having an impact on services. \nA spokesman said: \"They are giving a very accurate position from the frontline on the real impact that cuts to councils have. \n\"In the run up to the Scottish budget announcement last month Cosla president David O'Neill was very clear that a further cut to councils on top of the £350m cut from last year would lead to real job losses and have a real impact on services. \n\"These were not empty words - this is the harsh reality of the budget decisions taken by Scottish government and job losses and cuts to services are what we are starting to see come to fruition. \n\"Parents should be in no doubt that losing classroom assistants, technicians, cleaners and librarians does have a detrimental impact on their child's experience at school. Compounding this is the impact such significant job losses has on existing staff who are having to do their best to cover. \n\"Despite the best efforts of councils to maintain services, the reality is that the infrastructure around a lot of service areas is really starting to crumble.\" 'Spending power' \nThe Scottish government argues it has tried to protect councils in recent years from what it called \"Westminster austerity\". \nIn the coming year, less is being offered for ongoing commitments but the government says there will be more for local services overall through new money for head teachers, changes to the way council tax is calculated for some homes and possible across-the-board rises in council tax. \nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"We want all children and young people to receive the support they need in school to achieve their full learning potential. Decisions about employment of support staff are the responsibility of individual education authorities, in light of their priorities and local circumstances. \n\"Taking next year's local government finance settlement plus the other sources of income available through potential increases in council tax, and health and social care integration, the overall increase in spending power to support local authority services amounts to £241m or 2.3%.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T09:06:01.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
