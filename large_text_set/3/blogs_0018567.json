Smith; Dr. Ronnie Floyd, immediate past president of the Southern Baptist Convention; Rev. Johnnie Moore, and Rich Stearns, president of World Vision USA. \nTrump’s budget plan, which did not go line-by-line to direct specific cuts, said foreign assistance “is being refocused on priority strategic objectives and renewed attention is being placed on the appropriate U.S. share of international spending.” \nThe overview said Trump “seeks to reduce or end direct funding for international organizations whose missions do not substantially advance U.S. foreign policy interests, are duplicative, or are not well-managed. … These steps to reduce foreign assistance free up funding for critical priorities here at home and put America first.” \nElsewhere, the budget book said there is substantial funding for “humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program funding. This would focus funding on the highest priority areas while asking the rest of the world to pay their fair share.” \nMajor cuts are proposed for the United Nations and all programs connected with it, the World Bank and climate change efforts in developing countries. \nMick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, defended the foreign aid cuts Thursday.
