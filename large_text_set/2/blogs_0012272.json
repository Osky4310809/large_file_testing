Gone is the all-leather upper of the Nature Three, with the Nature IV replacing it with a minimalistic and breathable high performance knitted mesh upper. This is wrapped in side-stitched leather on the outside quarter that binds the upper with the sole, while the quarter heel counter is left in a contrasting single stitch. Riding up the foot, the mesh knit combines with the vegetable leather tanned in-sock to give a snug, contemporary sock-like fit on the ankle. Meanwhile, the most scientifically up-to-date foot bed is crafted from a translucent gum sole unit that uses flex grooves and Clarks’s signature hyper-response compression pods for a cushioned, super responsive ride.\nThe contemporary silhouette defines categorization, yet it translates into an instant wardrobe staple capable of being worn by anyone that transcends streetwear and style boundaries. We thought this as soon as we looked at it, but to prove our point, we asked three menswear commentators from three points on the map to style it the way they want.\nI started the website in 2014. It was a little side project at first, mostly to use as a gallery for some of my photography work. After a while, I started using it as a blog, it’s been really cool to see how it has changed and developed over the past few years. I chose the name because it really alludes to my longer term plans, I’m gonna be moving out of the fashion industry altogether in a few years, so it’s almost like a journal of my short time in the scene!\nWorking on a lot of road trip-led projects. My biggest passion at the moment is traveling on the road and taking a ton of photos along the way. I’m hopefully gonna be traveling North America for 90 days this summer, so I’m pretty excited about that.\nI used to wear Clarks in school! I had two or three different styles over the years – they were always the shoes that everyone’s parents would approve of. There’s a certain level of quality that the Clarks name carries; I’ve been aware of that since I was very, very young.\nThey’re super slick, it was cool to try them out and style them as I usually throw on a pair of chunky boots every morning, it’s nice to be reminded that footwear can actually feel comfortable. I loved the Navy colourway, it really blended with my style, cause I wear quite a large amount of blue denim, they’re lovely.\nI felt like I was wearing pillows on my feet. It was rather nice.\nWhen I was eight, my grandfather bought me a surfboard after lifeguards had seen me stand-up surfing on my boogie board. They told my father that I needed a surfboard asap and that I had something special. Being that I came from very little, my parents told my grandparents what the lifeguards told them. So later that year, I got my first board as a birthday present. I was terrified of it. But after letting it sit for about a year and a half, my father said to me, “Your grandfather spent good money on this. So, you have to at least give it a try.” That day we walked down to the beach and I went for it. First wave: I was hooked and never looked back.\nBy 11, I was competing; at 13, I won East Coast Championships; and by 14, I was getting paid to surf. So, for the following decade and change, I traveled all over the world competing, filming and shooting photos for surfing publications. During that time, I did random modeling jobs but I never put serious thought into making a serious push for that as a career move. Until I met a casting agent for a film in SoHo, NYC, that my focus shifted from surfing to acting and modeling work. Once I started booking jobs, I starting posting that work on my social media and then that began to grow into its own thing. Now, it’s all one big amalgam. It’s all one big wheel that helps itself keep turning.\nNo. I don’t believe for a f***ing second that anything dictates your potential other than yourself and your own mindset. There’s always success, no matter the state of the economy. You just need to be analytical and think outside of the box. I have multiple aspects to my professional life because that’s how I thrive mentally, not economically.\nI can describe how I try to approach it – I try to pick and choose things that are timeless. Things that were cool 20 years ago and will bc cool and relevant 20 years from now. A la Steve McQueen..\nI’ve been fan of Clarks since my father used to wear the desert boots all the time. He worked his ass off when I was a kid in those things. Now, I have come to love simplicity with detail. They offer that. That and a celebrated brand that has stayed relevant.\nIt’s a casual, comfortable shoe. Anything from joggers to jeans and a tee fit well with ’em.\nI have really busted up feet from breaking them surfing and skating, so it takes a lot for my feet to feel comfortable in shoes. But every pair of Clarks that I have are comfortable right from the get go.\nIt’s so long ago since we started now, but the reasons we started are the reasons we continue… a genuine love and enjoyment of fashion, art, music and nightlife under the banner of popular culture. The media landscape has changed a lot in that time and we’re happy to still be a part of everything that’s going on.\nBeing able to bring people together when we host en event; having someone tell us they really enjoyed an exhibition we’d recommended on the website; or having people say they’d wanted to travel to Tokyo because of the imagery we’d created. Basically the benefits that come from being able to share both locally in person and internationally through the web.\nTokyo has a long-held love of British subcultures and trends, and Clarks has its own place within that niche. The Clarks store in Shibuya itself is on quite an iconic corner between Shibuya and Harajuku, for instance.\nAn understated piece that can’t go wrong matched with denim.\nSmooth.\nMore Info Intrigued by Clarks new design direction?
