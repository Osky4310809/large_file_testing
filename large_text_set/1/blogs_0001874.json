His strategy? Bet against Rousey and earn over $70,000 for the trouble.\nAmanda Nunes completely decimated the former bantamweight champ and called for the end of “ this Ronda Rousey nonsense ” at UFC 207 . Ortiz showed off the spoils of betting against Rousey with a ticket showcasing a $77,500 payday on a $50,000 ticket. Adding insult to injury, The Huntington Beach Bad Boy quipped: “You have to love easy bets!”\n“Easy” or no, putting money on a big ticket fight isn’t always a formula for Scrooge McDuck level winnings. Just look at the curious case of (Vegas) Dave Oancea. In 2016, the dude managed to score big with a $77K bet on Miesha Tate beating Holly Holm that pulled in nearly $200K in winnings. That win led to betting a cool million on the newly title-minted Tate in her UFC 200 tilt against Nunes, a follow-up bet that sure as sugar did not pay off for the gambler. Let this be a reminder at the New Year to gamble responsibly and that goes for Moneybags Tito, too.\n(Via Champions )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T00:11:56.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
