Offerings from M.I.A., Waka Flocka Flame , Khalid, Denzel Curry , Saga & Thelonious Martin with Freddie Gibbs, The Twins, KNICE, Vail, and a full album from J-Haze also make the cut. Scroll down and bump those speakers. Rick Ross –“Summer 17” \nProduced by Beat Billionaire, Rick Ross’ new single “Summer 17” takes a few notes from Drake and serves as a warm-up for Rozay’s upcoming project, Rather You Than Me. In anticipation of the release, the Boss penned an open letter reflecting on his come-up: “10+ years in this game and it has all led to this moment right here. My entire life I was never given choices, I had to create this shit for myself. I had no choice but to boss up, to make it by any means necessary, to turn nothing into everything that you see in front of you today.” Rather You Than Me is the Carol City, Florida rapper’s first album under his Epic Records deal (he previously released nine albums under Def Jam). Check it out above. Desiigner –“Outlet” \nAhead of The Outlet Tour, 19-year-old Desiigner has finally revealed the official version of “Outlet,” which aims to bring the same heat the Brooklyn rapper brought with his smash hit, “Panda.” The G.O.O.D. Music signee begins his first headlining tour in Seattle on April 2 and will hit 24 additional cities, culminating with a show in Toronto, Canada on May 16. M.I.A. –“P.O.W.A.” \nAlthough Sri Lankan native M.I.A. said her last album, A.I.M . , would be her last, naturally she’s back with another video for “P.O.W.A.” Throughout the bass heavy song, she name drops several of today’s pop stars, including Ariana Grande and Rihanna, but not exactly in a positive manner. The self-directed video for the amp’ed up track is a cinematic cherry on top. Waka Flocka Flame –“Was My Dawg” \nWaka Flocka Flame takes shots at Gucci Mane in the new single, “Was My Dawg,” which appears to be the result of some hurt feelings. “Thought you was my nigga, shorty, thought you was my dawg/ Thought you was my nigga, shorty, thought you was my dawg/ You all for yourself, shorty, you a ball hog,” he raps. Check out our news article for more background and the full lyrics. Denzel Curry –“This Life” \nTaken from his Imperial project, Denzel Curry’s new video for “This Life” finds the talented MC keeping secrets from his lover as the South Floridian hits the arcade and appears to just be on a normal date. However, looks can be deceiving. Curry is set to perform at Coachella, where Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar are expected to headline in April. Saga & Thelonious Martin f. Freddie Gibbs –“Karma” \nFollowing “Yesterday” featuring Fashawn, Thelonious Martin and Brooklyn native Saga reveal another offering from their forthcoming collaborative album, Molotov , titled “Karma,” which features Freddie Gibbs . The album is scheduled for a February 17 release. Khalid –“Shot Down” \nEighteen-year-old El Paso, Texas native Khalid reaches way into his soul and writes from the heart. His new visual for the single “Shot Down” addresses the topic of love once again as he tries to make sense of all those crazy feelings.
