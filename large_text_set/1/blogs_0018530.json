There will be a total of 17 regular and special non-working holidays for 2017. \nSo what does this mean to those who have itchy feet? \nNow’s the best time to check off the destinations on your bucket list. Better yet, make a beeline today for the Glorietta Activity Center Palm Drive as Singapore Airlines (SIA) holds its fourth annual Showcase and Travel fair, ongoing until Jan. 22. \nIn celebration of its 70th anniversary across the globe, Singapore Airlines kicks off this momentous year with a series of exciting deals for its Filipino patrons. \n“We want to bridge the gap between places for all of you here,” enthused Carol Ong, general manager Philippines, during the travel fair launch held at Le Petit Souffle, Century City Mall. “Through the SIA portfolio, which includes Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, TigerAir and Scoot, we’ll bring you to 132 destinations all over the world.” \nAlso, one of the key highlights of Singapore Airlines’ 70th anniversary is the delivery of the new-generation A350, the latest aircraft in the system right now.   \n“This state-of-the-art aircraft is a lot more spacious and offers the ultimate in passenger comfort,” noted Ong. “We have two in the fleet right now and SIA ordered 65 more. Our commitment to fleet development will continue to be aggressive in the coming years.” \nInnovation has always been at the core of SIA’s operations. And for its 70th year, it continues to push the boundaries by expanding its network and pioneering services guaranteed to give the best experience to its customers. \n“We want to continue doing our best to exceed our customers’ expectations, whether it be more travel destinations, more frequent flights, or more great-value deals,” Ong added. \nTravel Now \nFrom Jan. 20 to 22, SIA provides its customers the perfect opportunity to achieve their travel goals this year as it features 85 destinations offered at exceptional rates. \nAll-inclusive round-trip Economy Class fares to Singapore and other Asian destinations are available from US$160. Fares to Australia are offered from US$570, while traveling to key destinations in Europe starts at just US$670. \n“Europe is one of the most favorite destinations of Filipinos,” Ong says. “So besides the major cities like London, Paris, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Zurich, and Rome, we are also taking you to Athens.” The trip to Athens is going to be operated by Singapore Airlines’ low-cost carrier Scoot starting June this year. \nScoot is not your typical low-cost carrier. It uses a wide-body aircraft. Plus, your meals and baggage are all-in when you travel SIA connecting on to Scoot out of Singapore. \n“Adding to the list is our very own destination — Stockholm. We’ll be flying a total of two destinations in the Nordic region. Currently, we’re serving Copenhagen and by May, we’ll be serving Stockholm as well using the latest A350 five times a week,” added Ong. \nCustomers can also travel to South Africa at fares starting from just US$770 and to the US starting from US$970. The Nordic Museum is one of the best ways to learn about Swedish culture and its rich history. This May, Stockholm will become the second Scandinavian city in Singapore Airlines’ route network when the airline introduces flights to Sweden’s capital via Moscow. \nPassengers can experience SIA’s newest cabin offering, Premium Economy Class, with the most attractive all-in round-trip rates. All-in fares on Premium Economy Class to Asian destinations are available from US$1000; to Australia from US$1350; to Europe from US$1500; and to South Africa from US$1700. A trip to New Zealand is offered from US$1800, and to the US for just US$1850. \nThose who want to travel in luxury and style can opt for SIA’s all-in Business Class fares. Traveling to various Southeast Asian destinations is offered from US$850 all-in, and to Australia from US$2000. Discounted rates to Europe and New Zealand are also available from just US$2500. Starting at US$3000, passengers can already fly Business Class to the United States or South Africa. \nThe sale is valid for purchase at the Singapore Airlines’ Showcase and Travel Fair 2017 at the Glorietta Activity Center Palm Drive from Jan. 20 to 22, and at the TriNoma Activity Center from Feb. 26 to 28. \nThe sale is also available online and at SIA and SilkAir ticket offices from Jan. 20 to Feb. 20. Travel period is from Feb. 1 until Dec. 31. Promotional fares are available for travel from Manila, Cebu, Davao and Kalibo. \nThe promotional fares are inclusive to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer members, BPI credit cardholders, and Globe Platinum customers, as well as Glorietta, TriNoma, and Ayala Center Cebu shoppers. \nBPI Cardholders can fly to Singapore for as low as US$160 all-in and to various other destinations starting today, Jan. 20. \nTo kick off the promo, BPI Cards will be holding Preview Sale events for select cardholders. The promo will also offer a Special Installment Plan with zero-percent interest on payments of up to six months. \n“This is our way of jumpstarting the new year for our clients,” said Marie Josephine Ocampo, head of BPI Payments and Cards. We want to be able to make their travel dreams happen and at the same time let them enjoy the value of their hard-earned money.” \nSIA passengers will also receive US$50 cash back for all eligible promotional fares purchased within the travel fair promo period. The cash back or its peso equivalent will be credited to a BPI Express Gift Card, which can be used at any local MasterCard-affiliated establishment, except for online transactions. \nCardholders may choose from these other parks: The Singapore exPass for only US$25, which gives them access to two local attractions worth up to US$80; a S$20 Changi Dollar Voucher valid for Singapore Airlines/SilkAir passengers with itineraries beyond Singapore for travel until March 31; and a free Singapore tour for Singapore Airlines/SilkAir passengers with a layover of at least 5.5 hours at Singapore Changi Airport. \n“Now in its 70th year, Singapore Airlines not only delivers 70 years of great work, but really reinforces the brand’s pillars — product innovation, network expansion and service excellence — that we promise we will continue to deliver in the next 70 more years,” enthused Ong. \n* * * \nFor bookings and inquiries, visit Singapore Airlines and SilkAir ticket offices, or call SIA Manila Reservations at 756-8888; SilkAir Cebu, (6332) 505-7871; SilkAir Davao, (6382) 227-5301; SilkAir Kalibo, (6336) 500-7226, or call any participating travel agent from Jan. 20 to Feb. 20. \nFor details, visit singaporeair.com/FLYSQ70.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T07:44:43.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
