Despite Ranieri’s heroics last season, it would be wrong to suggest he didn’t make mistakes trying to defend the title. \nThe recruitment last summer was shockingly bad, £60m spent on Nampalys Mendy, Ahmed Musa and record signing Islam Slimani who cost £30m from Sporting Lisbon.

He had effectively lost the dressing room, even inviting them to see the chairman if they were unhappy. And they clearly did.

It took pressure off the players. \nThis season, Ranieri has been rambling, his messages confusing and his facts wrong. The players got increasingly worried, to the point of Kasper Schmeichel having a row with Ranieri. \nThe dissent was growing. Ranieri even upset the players by taking chicken burgers off the menu after games, once again his tinkering instincts coming through. \nIt was noticeable that Leicester’s Thai owners watched from the edge of the pitch as the players warmed up in Sevilla on Wednesday which is something they do not usually do.

Ironically, Ranieri hugged Leicester’s goal scoring hero Vardy on the pitch after the game which perhaps was further proof that he did not see it coming. Or know the players had turned. \nFootball is a brutal and unforgiving world and even the greatest ever title success does not buy you much credit. \nBut to put it into perspective, Ranieri was voted FIFA world coach of the year on January 10. Now he is out of a job. poll loading Were Leicester City right to sack Claudio Ranieri? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:37:41.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
