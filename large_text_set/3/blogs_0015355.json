The numbers are below, with the results of their February poll in parenthesis : \nInvestigative documentary maker Jon Ossoff (D): 41 (32) \nEx-Secretary of State Karen Handel (R): 16 (25) \nBusinessman Bob Gray (R): 16 (11) \nState Sen. Judson Hill (R): 9 (9) \nEx-state Sen. Dan Moody (R): 5 (2) \nEx-state Sen. Ron Slotin (D): 3 (not tested in February) \nCertified public accountant David Abroms (R): 2 (not tested in February) \nBusinessman Bruce LeVell (R): 1 (1) \nIn the likely event that no one takes a majority of the vote in April, the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, will advance to a June runoff. According to this poll, Jon Ossoff looks very well-positioned to reach the runoff, while Karen Handel’s stock has dropped a bit. By contrast, rich guy Bob Gray, a Trump supporter who literally attempted to drain a swamp in one of his ads , could edge out Handel for the second runoff spot. \nBut there’s one number Democrats will very much like. \nBack in February, Clout showed the GOP field taking a combined 48 percent of the vote, while Ossoff grabbed 31. In their March poll, the GOP still takes 48 percent while Ossoff and fellow Democrat Ron Slotin take a combined 44 percent. This seat has been Republican for decades, but it swung from 61-38 Romney to just 48-47 Trump . The April electorate will be different from the June electorate, but this survey at least indicates that more voters are keen to support the Democrats now than they were a short time ago. \nThere are a few big caveats. Not many groups have surveyed this race, and it’s never a good idea to rely on one pollster. Clout Research, formally known as Wenzel Strategies, does not have a good record , and Clout has also displayed some strange habits in the past . This poll gives Ossoff some potentially good numbers, but we have a long way to go before the April primary, much less the June runoff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T22:16:07.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
