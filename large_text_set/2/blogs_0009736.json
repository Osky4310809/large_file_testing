Photo from the Asean Basketball League Facebook page \nIt was one of those victories that Alab Pilipinas coach Mac Cuan hopes will be the start of something special for the Filipino club, which has struggled to put together a string of solid performances in the 2017 Asean Basketball League. \nWith their imports rising to the challenge in the extra period, Alab hacked out a thrilling 64-62 overtime victory Sunday night over host Singapore Slingers to tighten their grip of third spot at OCBC Arena. \n“We needed wins like this, to finish games this way because most of the games in the playoffs will be like this,” said Cuan after Alab beat the Slingers for the second straight time to rise to 7-4.
