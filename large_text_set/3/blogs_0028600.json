March 28, 2017 / Posted by: Michael K 103 This morning, when I read the headline, “ TLC To Revive Trading Spaces ,” I prayed to the gods to please fart some sense into the heads of TLC executives and get them to offer former HSOTD Hildi Santo-Thomas anything she wants to come out of interior design retirement to star in the revival of Trading Spaces . If TLC did that, they’d almost redeem themselves for infecting the world with the Duggars.\nVariety says that at the Discovery Communications upfront presentation in NYC today, TLC announced that Trading Spaces is making a comeback after being away from our television screens for almost ten years. Trading Spaces , which took its format from the BBC show Changing Rooms , helped put TLC on the basic cable map. It ran from 2000 to 2008 and made stars out of some of the cast and introduced the world to the Queen of Interior Glamour Hildi Santo-Thomas!\nThe revival of Trading Spaces will make its debut during the 2017-2018 season. Nancy Daniels , the President and General Manager of TLC, said this during upfronts today:\n“TLC is back into home and property with Nate & Jeremiah By Desig n, our new show helping distressed homeowners turn disasters into dream homes. We are thrilled to expand in this space, and what better way to do that than to bring back Trading Spaces, the series that put property on the map.”\nI just hope that the revived Trading Spaces keeps the ingredient that made it special: fuckery. I am so sick of today’s basic TV designers creating boring rooms that could put a methed-up dolphin to sleep. I’m over shiplap, grey kitchen cabinets and travertine. Bring on the rooms that are so beautifully ugly and magnificently tacky that they make the homeowners cry and vow to never speak to their neighbors again. And Hildi was the grand master at that! See her legendary hay room:\nHer legendary fake flowers bathroom:\nHer legendary circus beach room:\nAnd the legendary mural of herself in someone else’s house :\nHildi retired from interior design and moved to Paris where she apparently works as a florist. Hildi’s Wikipedia page says that she currently lives in a one room flat in Paris and is rarely seen in public. Being a flower-designing hermit in Paris sounds like a dream life, but hopefully TLC lures Hildi back to the spotlight, because what the world really needs now is her beautiful brand of WTF.\nPics : TLC", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildi_Santo-Tomas", "http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/trading-spaces-tlc-revive-animal-planet-my-fat-pet-1202017815/", "http://dlisted.blogspot.com/2005/04/hot-slut-of-day_03.html"], "published": "2017-03-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T00:59:42.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
