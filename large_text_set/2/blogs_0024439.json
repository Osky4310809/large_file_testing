No more rapping, please!\" (Photo: ArsenalTV) \nOne of the Gunners' famous Invincibles, Ray Parlour , has brought this issue to the fore once again. \nDuring his co-hosting of talkSPORT's Breakfast Show, he took on a cover of Stormzy track Shut Up in front of the man himself - complete with bespoke Arsenal lyrics. \nIt's quite something. Take a look for yourself: \nWe've got to admit it's an admirable debut effort from Ray Pizzy. He gets particular credit for not only having his own original verses, but for crowbarring in \"mandem\" in there as well. It's a solid 7/10 from us. \nBut how does that stack up against other footballers' efforts? Let's take a look... Yannick Bolasie vs Bradley Wright-Phillips - rap battle \nBack in 2014, Bradley Wright-Phillips \"sent\" for Yannick Bolasie by calling him out with this effort.

We're scoring Bradley 8/10 - but Yannick just edges this with 9/10 due to his stage presence. Well, he moves about a bit... John Barnes & Jamie Redknapp - Rappers' Delight \nYes, we know you're probably expecting to see Barnes' efforts on World In Motion on here, but you've probably seen that five or six hundred times before. \nSo here's the main man collaborating with Jamie Redknapp on Rappers' Delight: Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now \nThis ticks a lot of boxes from us - classic song, spitting bars skill, powerful outfits. It's a 9/10. Paul Gascoigne - Geordie Boys \nIf you've never seen or heard Geordie Boys before, you're in for a treat.
