He was aged 93 years. He died after a brief illness. \n“The Janiza prayer and interment are slated for tomorrow (Sunday) by 10am.” \nBello said that the late Islamic preacher fore-told his death and was prepared for it. \n“Baba had told us that his time was up. He told me personally during his last moment that he has completed his divine assignment and was ready to meet his creator. \n“He told us to remain dedicated to the cause of Islam and urged us all not to deviate from all his teachings on righteousness, piety and total submission to the will of Allah. He warned us to shun adultery but that we are free to marry as many women as possible instead of piling up cuncubines because it is ‘Hallal’ before Allah.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T04:33:23.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
