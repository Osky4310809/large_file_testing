The look was complete with a baseball cap that sported the logo from Drake's brand, October's Very Own.\nDrake immediately took notice of the hat, and posted a photo of Sasha on his Instagram with the caption, \"Style Popper,\" notes Cosmopolitan.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama family is preparing to leave the White House just as President-elect Donald Trump continues his controversial transition. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Trump revealed that his plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would include a replacement that guaranteed \"insurance for everybody.\"\n\"It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,\" Trump said of the replacement, which he said is almost finished. He declined to offer specifics to The Post but said it has \"lower numbers, much lower deductibles.\"\n\n\"We’re going to have insurance for everybody,\" he said. \"There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.\"\nTrump also doubled down on his promise to \"not have people dying on the street\" with his new healthcare plan.\n\"It’s not going to be their plan,\" he told The Post of people covered under Obamacare. \"It’ll be another plan. But they’ll be beautifully covered. I don’t want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T17:20:02.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
