You know, the curly blonde haired girl from Pennsylvania who moved to Nashville and took the world by storm?\nDoes anyone know where the heck she is? Or what she’s been up to? She has been so silent, it’s almost deafening and slightly eery. WHERE DID YOU GO TAYLOR? Can you at least give us SOMETHING?\nAre you on vacation? Do you have the flu? Are you literally living in a recording studio? Do you still keep in touch with Tom? Oh crap, are you still with Tom?! Like secretly? Do you even live in New York anymore? If so, let’s totally catch up (I’ll be there in a week).\nIn all seriousness though, the last time Taylor posted on Instagram was a week ago . And it wasn’t a picture of her. Or her adorable cats . Or of cookies. Nope. It was of Lorde’s new single (which is totally understandable because it’s dope).\nTaylor Swift Instagram And the last time she posted on Twitter was January 29th. THAT’S ALMOST TWO MONTHS AGO GUYS. THIS IS NOT OK. NOT GOOD. JUST NO.\nTaylor Swift Twitter LUCKILY, our favorite red head, Ed Sheeran stepped up to the plate and gave us some very vague hints.\nIn an interview with BBC he told us, “Taylor [Swift] isn’t going to be releasing until probably the end of this year – Christmas is the smartest time to release because that’s when everyone buys records. So I’ve got a full year of just all Ed, all the time.” \nSo basically, we are all doomed for the next eight months.\nTaylor, what do we need to do to get your attention? Like I know we aren’t worthy or whatever, but, eight months is just way too long for us to handle this absence. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-18T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T03:03:26.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
