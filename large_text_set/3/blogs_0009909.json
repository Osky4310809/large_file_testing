It's for San Francisco band The Seshen 's latest single \"Colors Collide\" and was directed by animator and collage artist Jesse Cafiero . \"My goal while creating the video was to make the viewer feel like they had entered a unique visual world,\" Cafiero tells Creators. \nThe video features singer Lalin St. Juste amongst the surreal imagery, with Cafiero shooting scenes of her singing and then printing out frames to use as cutouts . \n\"We felt that collage would be a beautiful art form that would extend the feel of the song.\" the band tell Creators. \"We wanted something that felt both old and new, shifting through time and place. The song is about illusions and quest, searching for a place that is beyond the physical realm .\" \nCafiero shot the video with a camera overhead while he positioned the various visual components, shooting photos frame by frame in the traditional way for stop-motion. \"It's a bit time consuming but I really love the imperfections that come up with animating this way,\" notes the director. \"It has a slightly chaotic feel and to me really feels like the video is a living thing.\" \nThe video features a dream scenario, so using stop-motion adds a certain hypnagogic sensation. Miles Davis' album cover for Bitches Brew was also used as a visual reference, mentioned to Cafiero by the band, while the artist notes that the mellotron sound that begins the track also had an influence. \"I'm a big fan of the instrument and it has a darkness in its tone that matches really well with my aesthetic.\" he notes. \nCheck out the \"Colors Collide\" music video below. \nYou can buy or stream \"Colors Collide\" by the The Seshen here .
