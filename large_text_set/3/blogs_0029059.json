In the past months, Startup World Cup hosted similar events in cities across the globe.\nJapanese startup UniFa was crowned the winner of this first edition of Startup World Cup.\nUniFa’s concept that may sound creepy to some and futuristic to others. The company offers a suite of smart devices, like a robot, a thermometer, and bed, intended to collect data from children as they attend kindergarten to give parents a better way to connect with their child’s experience.\nOpen Bionics from the United Kingdom took the second spot. Its product is a 3D-printed bionic arm for amputees.\nIndonesian startup Ahlijasa came in third. It’s an app for on-demand household services like laundry.\nThe driving force behind Startup World Cup is Fenox Venture Capital. (Disclosure: Fenox VC is an investor in Tech in Asia .

The VC firm threw its full weight behind the endeavor – tech A-listers like Steve Wozniak, Guy Kawasaki, Tim Draper, and Alexis Ohanian were among the speakers and jury members at the final event.\nThough headquartered in the US, Fenox has a strong footprint in Southeast Asia. It runs an accelerator called G&B in Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. Ahlijasa, one of the winners, was also a participant in this accelerator program.\nThis post Japan, UK, and Indonesia claim victory at Startup World Cup appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T10:44:34.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
