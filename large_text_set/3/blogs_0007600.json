Instead of people trying to get ahead on their own merit they do it by pushing other people down with whatever BS they can get away with. Cant wait to get through the next decade so I can get the heck out of here and retire. thegreatgabbert says: Mar 9, 2017 8:12 PM \nScot’s case was going well until the team lawyers rolled out a list of his player transactions. tomtravis76 says: Mar 9, 2017 8:21 PM \nThe best thing for the NFL would be to have a yearly review board of ownership to see if team owners check all the mandatory requirements each season to be an efficient owner in the NFL. If not ,then their should be a clause in ownership agreements that forces an owner to sell to a board approved group. Owners like Snyder are holding these teams that really belong to the fans as hostages. Fans were there before the owners and will be there after the owner is gone, each fan base deserves to have owners that want to leave team better than when they took over doing no harm while holding the keys.

Mar 9, 2017 8:22 PM \nYou can’t make this stuff up ? bassplucker says: Mar 9, 2017 8:23 PM \nWrongful termination with a side of slander, anyone? If Scot has a case and wins, he’ll be set for life with Danny’s money paying for it all. Packernet says: Mar 9, 2017 8:27 PM \nIf he’s drinking he has no case. If one player says he was drunk in the locker room it’s game over. Sad to see, but it happens in every walk of life. Alcoholism is a serious problem that is hard to beat. I hope he can get it turned around, if not he could end up dead. Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
