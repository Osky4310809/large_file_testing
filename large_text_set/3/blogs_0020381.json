Michael confirmed the news with a post on his Instagram account: Michael entered the league in 2013 when the Seattle Seahawks used a second-round pick on him following his four-year career at Texas A&M. He found himself behind Marshawn Lynch on the depth chart and didn't make an early impact before Seattle traded him to the Dallas Cowboys in 2015. He returned to Seattle in 2016 and saw a heavier workload following Lynch's retirement and an injury to Thomas Rawls, but the team ultimately waived him upon Rawls' return. The Packers claimed him off waivers with Eddie Lacy nursing an ankle injury, but Michael tallied just 114 rushing yards in six regular-season games and 58 in three playoff contests for Green Bay. Converted wide receiver Ty Montgomery was more reliable in the backfield for the Packers down the stretch. Michael's nine games with the Seahawks in 2016 were the only time he made a sizable statistical impact in his career to this point: Christine Michael's Career Stats", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T02:59:07.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
