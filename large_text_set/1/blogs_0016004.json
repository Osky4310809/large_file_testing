Ultimately, winning the game is all that matters against lower league opposition when there is little to gain and a lot to lose should things go wrong. \nNegatives \nBoth strikers (Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge) suffered from poor service but did little to suggest the manager should use them more often. \nManager rating out of 10 \n8 -- Got the job done and gave another youngster his debut. Will worry how toothless Liverpool seemed at times but getting through without using first-choice players was the mission and it was accomplished. \nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10=best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating) \nGK Loris Karius, 7 -- Made a nice save when Liverpool had only just gone in front and was generally comfortable with the ball at his feet. Had one or two dicey moments in the air when Plymouth tried to put pressure on, but a spectator for the most part. \nDF Trent Alexander-Arnold, 8 -- Although rarely troubled on the wing he made several important clearances in the box as he covered well for Joe Gomez. Not very effective going forward but did everything that was asked of him at the back and after his good performance at Old Trafford he once again looked the part. \nDF Joe Gomez, 7 -- Steady and strong, decent in possession and largely unruffled by his burly opponent Paul Garita. An early booking might have caused him problems but kept cool when the home side pressed on rare occasions. \nDF Lucas Leiva, 7 -- Led the side well and even scored the goal from a corner, amazingly his first in seven years. Played his part in keeping good possession during a second half where Liverpool focused on taking the sting out of the game rather than putting it out of Plymouth's reach. \nDF Alberto Moreno, 6 -- Usual problems in the first half, not enough quality when going forward and was caught out of position at the back. Steadied himself in the second half and won a penalty which should have calmed Liverpool's nerves near the end. \nMF Kevin Stewart, 5 -- Good at the workmanlike stuff like interceptions, pressing and one particularly good tackle after a Moreno error. Kept the ball well enough in the second half but little if any contribution to forward play. \nMF Ovie Ejaria, 6 -- Like Stewart, he was quiet and methodical but rarely did anything out of the ordinary to exploit the opposition staying deep. \nMF Philippe Coutinho, 7 -- A useful hour for the Brazilian coming back from injury. He was a class above everyone on the pitch but his timing was off more often than not. Klopp obviously just wanted him to get a run-out because the game certainly wasn't clinched by the time he was substituted. Lucas Leiva scored his first goal in seven years, burying a first-half header that proved to be the winner. \nFW Ben Woodburn, 6 -- Almost invisible on the wing in the first half, he was more central in the second half and used the ball tidily if a little too safely at times. Playing under orders obviously, he got another appearance without ever really showing what he is fully capable of. \nFW Divock Origi, 4 -- Another wretched performance in the cup, capped by an awful penalty which was easily saved. Wandered around without ever really linking well with Daniel Sturridge but once the Englishman was replaced he fared no better. One strong run after the penalty ended with a wild shot over the bar, summing up his evening. \nFW Daniel Sturridge, 5 -- A difficult night, with a packed defence and inexperienced teammates around him, he still looked lethargic and occasionally disinterested. Sometimes he even did his team more harm than good. Looked aggrieved at being replaced, though it's a mystery he lasted so long. \nSubstitutes \nMF Harry Wilson, 6 -- A debut for the Welsh youngster and he showed one or two touches a more experienced player would have been proud of, particularly when he almost scored by hustling the goalkeeper. \nMF Sheyi Ojo, NR -- Came on too late for a rating but it would have been high as he gave the Reds a vital outlet on the left. Gave Plymouth some late worries where they didn't want them and looked the most likely to carve out a second killer goal for the visitors. \nSteven Kelly is one of ESPN FC's Liverpool bloggers.
