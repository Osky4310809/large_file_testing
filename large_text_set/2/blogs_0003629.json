The Epic! app gives kids 12 and under access to over 20,000 books, including popular bestsellers and award winners. Advertisement \nEpic! works a lot like the Netflix of children’s books, putting the power of a library in kid’s hands. Once you’ve signed up for a subscription, kids can read any book in Epic’s library at any time as many times as they want on any device. There are no ads or in-app purchases, and you can even setup as many as four separate profiles per account. That way different kids can use the same app to access all of their favorite books like Goosebumps , Corduroy , Nancy Clancy , and the Warriors series. The subscription service costs $4.99 a month, but you can try out the service for the first month for free. \nEpic! | iOS App Store", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:04:54.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
