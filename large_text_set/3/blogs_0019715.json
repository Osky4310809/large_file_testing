It would not say whether any other missiles struck Israeli-held territory, but it said the safety of Israeli civilians and the safety of the Israeli aircraft \"were not compromised.\" \nThe army said the incident set off sirens in Jewish settlement communities in the Jordan Valley in the West Bank. A map showing Israel and Syria. Google Maps \nThe firing of missiles from Syria toward Israeli aircraft is extremely rare, though Israeli military officials said there was a shoulder-fired missile a few months ago. \nThere was no immediate comment from the government in Damascus, nor its ally Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group that is believed to possess such missiles. \nIsrael has been largely unaffected by the Syrian civil war raging next door, suffering mostly sporadic incidents of spillover fire over the frontier that Israel has generally dismissed as tactical errors by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government forces. Israel has responded to these cases lightly, with limited reprisals on Syrian positions in response to the errant fire. \nIran, Israel's arch-enemy, has been Assad's staunchest backer and has provided militia fighters to help him. \nIsrael is concerned Hezbollah, with which it fought a war in 2006, is trying to obtain sophisticated weapons it could use against Israel. \nIsrael is widely believed to have carried out a number of airstrikes on advanced weapons systems in Syria — including Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles and Iranian-made missiles, as well as Hezbollah positions — but it rarely confirms them. \nHezbollah is a close ally of the Syrian government and is fighting alongside Assad's forces in Syria's civil war. \nLast week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss what he charged were Iran's attempts to establish a permanent military foothold in Syria.
