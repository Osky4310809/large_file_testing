For the renovation, a wall separating the kitchen from the dining room was removed, freeing up the space, and the kitchen was completely remade with the original hardwood floors revealed (once six layers of old flooring were removed) and refinished, and new cabinets added with black honed-granite countertops. Ben custom-made a small center island using wood reclaimed from homeowner Ross’s family cabin. \nStay tuned. You’ll likely be hearing a lot more about the Napiers and this exciting new series.

See the Complete Gallery See All Photos Home Town Heroes \nBen and Erin Napier are whiz kids when it comes to recognizing potential in classic old homes — and turning that potential into reality. But their intentions go well beyond merely fixing up and remodeling old houses. Their stated ambitions have to do with helping the small southern town they love become revitalized while retaining its historic feel and authenticity. Photo By: Jacques Cornell Higher Purposes \n\"This town has seen hard times,\" the couple states in the show's opening montage, \"but we're committed to changing that, one house at a time.\" Real Roots \n\"No one loves a place more than we love our town,\" Ben says in his endearing native drawl. \"We're trying to help it. We're trying to bring it back.\" Finishing the thought, Erin chimes in: \"And the only way we know how to contribute to bringing it back to its heyday is to make it a friendly and welcoming place to new people who are coming here. It's going through a major rebirth and it's so exciting to be a part of it.\" Good People \nThe Napiers have allied themselves with some of the best builders and tradespeople in the area, forging a \"dream team\" who know how to do things right when it comes to restoring old homes. And the two of them are perfectly matched for leading and supervising the efforts. Ben brings grassroots building know-how, woodworking skills and natural craftsmanship to the table while Erin is all about vision, design and decor. It's an ideal partnership; yin and yang with a southern twist.

Here Erin and Ben take a stroll around the town's historic area with two good friends. Perfect Symmetry \nThe Napiers and their clients Ross and Laura are of like mind when it comes to what \"home\" means. Ross and Laura are newcomers to the area and would like to find something in the town's historic district. \"We want a home with a story,\" says Ross. \"You know, when the history books come out about [this town] 100 years from now, we want to be part of the group that really made it great and brought it back.\" \nThe couple is looking to find their forever home on a budget of $215,000 — a healthy budget in such a small town. Laura is an avid potter and wants something with studio space, and space for entertaining is important to both.

You've got to invest a little time and story into a place before it can be 'your' house.\" The home's exterior, in its current state, is less than spectacular, and the porch and entry are in sad shape. But the asking price is $159,000, which would potentially leave prospective buyers Ross and Laura with more than $50,000 for renovations. AFTER \nThe Willett House. The louvered glass and brick skirt were removed, and the porch entirely reframed with new columns, railing and stairs. The porch floor was leveled and old laminate floor covering was removed to reveal the original wood underneath. The original floor was then painted with gray porch paint.

AFTER \nA wall separating the kitchen from the dining room was removed, opening the space to the main living area and providing the kitchen with a whole new sense of scale. A peninsula and serving bar was added where the old wall had been, and a cased opening with 9-foot door height incorporated into the new design. No less than six layers of old flooring were removed before reaching the original floors underneath which, to Erin's delight, were hardwood. Other kitchen upgrades included black honed-granite countertops, white subway tile backsplash and new cabinets that were custom built on-site.
