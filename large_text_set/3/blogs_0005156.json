The hole melted into the bed (Photo: Liverpool Echo) \nThe couple now want to warn other parents of the dangers after the incident at their home in Bootle, The Liverpool Echo reports. \nThe 27-year-old said: “She awoke to a burning feeling on her leg to then realise her bed was on fire and she was trapped inside a dripping mess that was her blanket.” \nThe quick-thinking youngster was unable to reach the plug but grabbed her stuffed bunny rabbit, Ted, and pushed it against the plug to switch off her reading light.

She couldn’t get out.” \nMatt then pulled his daughter away from the “smouldering mess” but the family did not need to call firefighters. \nThe relieved dad said it was a “miracle” he was woken by the smell. \nBrooque-Rae was left shaken but escaped virtually unharmed apart from a small burn on her foot. \nAdele said: “I don’t understand why the lamp could get so close to being on fire but didn’t trip in the plug or socket despite the heat.

I have been in utter shock. \n“I’m a very heavy sleeper so God knows what would have happened if Matt wasn’t here.” \nThe couple said they didn’t consider a low-wattage light to be such a danger – and are urging other parents to make sure lamps in children’s rooms are switched off by the plug. \nBrooque’s bed has been thrown in the bin but her trusty rabbit teddy bear which has been with her since the day she was born survived the ordeal – albeit with a burnt ear.
