That idea is being roundly rejected so far by the over-the-edge right (potentially a majority of House Republicans) so it might be already obsolete. But it's worth looking at in-depth anyway, because it's a reflection of Republican thinking on healthcare. \nBasically, their attitude is that it's a function of tax policy rather than actual delivery of care to people, so how can they deliver the maximum tax benefit to the people who they think deserve it and pass it off as something to help Obamacare consumers losing their health insurance with repeal? \nKaiser Family Foundation has done the analysis of the Republican proposals for tax credits and has found that they would be less generous, and would most benefit wealthier and younger people. A new analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the average health insurance premium tax credit received by consumers in 2020 would be at least 36 percent lower under replacement proposals being discussed by Republicans in Congress than under the Affordable Care Act. \nThe average tax credit also would increase more slowly under replacement proposals, the analysis finds: In the House Discussion Draft alternative to the ACA, which has been recently discussed in media reports, the average tax credit for current ACA marketplace enrollees would rise from an estimated $2,957 in 2020 to $3,729 in 2027. By comparison, the average tax credit under the ACA would be $4,615 in 2020, increasing to $6,648 in 2027. […] \nIt finds that people with lower incomes, who are older, or who live in markets with higher premiums would receive larger tax credits under the ACA than under replacement proposals. By contrast, people with higher incomes, who are younger, or who live in areas with lower premiums would benefit more from alternative plans. \nThe ACA takes into account more than just income in determining subsidy rates. In addition to family income, it considers the local cost of insurance and age. The regional difference in health insurance premium costs is significant, and the Republican tax credits don't take that into account at all, as shown below. \nAgain, the issue might be moot for Republican leadership, since so many House Republicans—and their enablers Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Mike Lee in the Senate—are rejecting tax credits. But that creates a massive problem in doing what moderate (whatever that is anymore) Republicans are insisting they have to see before they'll support a repeal, and that's replacement plan that at least has the appearance of replacing the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:30:19.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
