Photograph: Jason Reed / Reuters/Reuters Datablog How would Richard Di Natale's reduced working week affect Australia's economy? \nAustralia was ranked 12th in the number of hours worked, per worker, in 2015, according to OECD data View more sharing options Wednesday 15 March 2017 04.20 GMT Last modified on Wednesday 15 March 2017 04.22 GMT \nThe Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has raised the prospect of reducing the number of hours in the Australian working week in his National Press Club address, alongside a number of other policies: \nWe rightly talk about the 16% of people who want to work more hours. But what we don’t hear about is from the more than one in four Australians who say, ‘We want to work less.’ \nA four-day working week or a six-hour day, it might actually make us happier and create more opportunities for others who want more work. Ignore the headlines: a six-hour working day is the way forward | Daniel Bernmar Read more \nSo how does Australia’s working life compare with other countries around the world? And just how would a reduced working week affect workers and the economy? \nAmong OECD countries, Australia ranked 12th in the number of hours worked, per worker, in 2015 according to OECD data : table \nAustralians worked fewer hours than those in the UK or New Zealand but more than those in Germany, Norway or Denmark. \nThere’s also a correlation between the number of hours worked and the productivity of workers per country , with countries that have workers working fewer hours generally being more productive: \nWhile it doesn’t necessarily follow from this that working fewer hours directly makes you more productive, it is one possible reason for the trend observed. Why working fewer hours would make us more productive Read more \nAnecdotally, there are interviews with people who have reduced their hours, and pilot projects that reduce hours for specific organisations, that do suggest working less but being more focused during those hours does result in better work output. \nA retirement home in Sweden, for example, experimented with shifting staff to a six-hour shift from eight hours . The change cost the retirement home more but resulted in better care provided and better conditions for workers, according to the head of elderly care at the home. Other trials in the country have had mixed results, according to the BBC . \nThere are also studies that link longer working hours to poor health outcomes, such as this study in The Lancet that showed an association between longer work hours and an increased risk of stroke . \nHowever, to avoid negatively impacting poorer workers, any nationwide reduction or cap on working hours would need to go hand-in-hand with something like universal basic income, or other changes to ensure a basic level of income was preserved.
