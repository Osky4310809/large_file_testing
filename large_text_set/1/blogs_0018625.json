He’s also cousins with the basketballer’s dad. \nBut while Dellavedova has never actually met his second cousin — and has only played “maybe half an hour” of basketball in his entire life — the success has pushed him to want to be an elite athlete. \n“It’s a bit annoying when I type in my name and it pops up with him. So it’s a bit instinctive for me to get better and hopefully one day my face will be on there,” he said. \n“I don’t actually follow basketball but I’ve had more interest in it simply because he’s playing. I watched a bit of his college game and then he won... what was that? He had a big victory. \n“It’s good for him and it’s pretty cool that we’re related.” Tennis player Matthew Dellavedova during his first round win in the Australian Open Boys’ Singles.

He stands at 6’3’” - the NBA Matthew is 6’4” — and is proud of his one-handed backhand, which helped him win through to the second round of the Boys’ Singles. \n“I’ll play this (Australian Open) and then head overseas to hopefully play a bunch of Futures and Challengers (tournaments),” he said. \n“I got my first ATP point recently so hopefully I can gain on that.” \nDespite his height and family pedigree, Dellavedova says he is definitely more interested in tennis than basketball. But he certainly shares personality traits — and a nickname — that we expect to see from his family name. \n“I like the fight, the competition. Going out there, it’s just two guys — a bit like boxing — where you’re one-on-one and completely by yourself. NBA player Matthew Dellavedova in action.
