Those in favor of the pipeline regard this development as significant. Protests delayed progress for three months, but now the 2000-mile-long pipeline is readied to move oil from North Dakota, through South Dakota and Iowa, and to a shipping site in Illinois. However, it’s not yet certain when full operation will begin.\nAnd in the meantime, many still battle to preserve the land the pipeline disrupts. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes continue to pursue their lawsuit which demands a stop to the project. From the AP: \n“The tribes in December held up the project by successfully pushing the U.S. government for a full environmental study of the Lake Oahe crossing, which is in southern North Dakota. But the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the Missouri River for the government, rescinded the study and gave the company permission to complete the pipeline at the urging of President Donald Trump shortly after he took office.”﻿\n\n\nTrump to Sign Order Advancing Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines [Updated] Trump to Sign Order Advancing Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines [Updated] Trump to Sign Order Advancing Keystone and Dakota… On the second business day of his presidency, Donald Trump, a man with two butt holes but no mouth, … Read more Read more \nThe protestors’ camps were forcibly shutdown in February, and since that time, on-site demonstrations have abated. Energy Transfer Partners, for their part, argues that their pipeline, which cost a grand total of $3.8 billion, is not environmentally dangerous. But opposers have by no means accepted the company’s assurances of safety. In addition to the ongoing lawsuits, there have been “recent coordinated physical attacks” against the pipeline itself.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T05:05:11.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
