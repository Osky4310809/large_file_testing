The account’s handle is @HalfOnionInABag , and it’s literally just half an onion in a bag. The account was created on Inauguration Day (January 20th) and since then has amassed a following of 177k. What if this account that is simply half an onion in a Ziploc bag ended up with more followers than @realDonaldTrump ? pic.twitter.com/D28lODPZLO \n— Half An Onion (@HalfOnionInABag) January 20, 2017 \nMostly the account Tweets things about the President, his cabinet, and his family as it relates to onions, from the perspective of the half onion. I won’t clog your feeds. I’m just here to get more followers than @realDonaldTrump & then hopefully be used on a hamburger or in an omelet. \n— Half An Onion (@HalfOnionInABag) January 20, 2017 In the process of writing my first book: “Half Onion In A Bag: The Art of the Meal” \n— Half An Onion (@HalfOnionInABag) January 21, 2017 Just curious @realDonaldTrump , is it difficult to peel an onion with such tiny hands? \n— Half An Onion (@HalfOnionInABag) January 22, 2017 Eric Trump always looks like he accidentally bit into a whole raw onion & is trying to act like he meant to and that it actually tastes good pic.twitter.com/SNFPL4RlSe \n— Half An Onion (@HalfOnionInABag) January 22, 2017 Who wore it better? pic.twitter.com/kHSarXv9YW \n— Half An Onion (@HalfOnionInABag) January 23, 2017 Still a better cabinet than @realDonaldTrump ‘s. pic.twitter.com/E5WAx0vGvy \n— Half An Onion (@HalfOnionInABag) January 24, 2017 \nOne of the half onion’s followers tweeted that while the concept is “really stupid,” it’s “exactly the kinda thing that would get under his skin.” \nProbably, yeah. \nHave a tip we should know?
