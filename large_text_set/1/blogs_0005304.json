I mean, I don’t even have words to describe how I feel when I see all such things happening around me. It’s rather depressing to see women getting molested, raped and touched inappropriately anywhere and everywhere in the country. The Bangalore molestation video is going viral on social media sites and for all those who haven’t watched it yet, I’d suggest, please do. It is utterly shameful to see what’s happening to the women in our country. This isn’t about Delhi or Bangalore being unsafe but about the mentality and upbringing of men in India. It’s high time, we take strict action against such incidents. Among Bollywood actors who has strongly reacted to the Bangalore molestation case is Swara Bhaskar. The actress took to Twitter to share her views on the unfortunate incident and here’s what she has to say: #Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara you must resign.. you share the mentality of the molesters #bangaloremolestation #bangalore #shame. \nI don’t know if the Karnataka minister’s resignation would help solve the purpose but one thing that I know for sure is that until and unless the government and police don’t become stricter with their rules and punishments, there is no chance that these hooligans would change. Women in the country need to be treated with dignity and men need to realise that we are not objects of their desire. What Swara has tweeted shows how furious the Bangalore molestation case has made her and I am sure the entire nation feels the same too. But will the country’s rules become stricter? Will there be harsh punishments imposed on molesters and all those who commit such heinous crimes?
