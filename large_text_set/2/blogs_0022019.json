Samsung is sending out the latest February security update for this handset. Firmware version G920IDVS3EQB2 is now being rolled out for the Galaxy S6 in India. The firmware weighs in at just over 134MB and its changelog mentions that it includes device stability improvements, bug fixes and further improvements for performance. It doesn’t include any major changes so don’t expect much in the way of new features with this update. \nSamsung detailed the February security patch earlier this month. It brings fixes for dozens of vulnerabilities identified by Google in Android OS as well as fixes for vulnerabilities that are exclusive to Samsung’s software. The company has been gradually rolling out this security patch for supported devices over the past few weeks. \nGalaxy S6 users in India will now start receiving an over-the-air update notification which lets them know that they have a new update to download and install. It should go live for all users very soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:59:30.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
