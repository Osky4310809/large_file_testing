If you work in or follow media, you are familiar with (or maybe repped by) Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel . Perhaps you aren’t as familiar with their brother Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel . That’s about to change. \nFox News has made a timely move by signing Dr. Emanuel as a contributor. In his role, effective immediately, the renowned oncologist and architect of the Affordable Care Act will offer healthcare and policy analysis across Fox News and Business’s daytime and prime time programming. \nDr. Emanuel is no stranger to Fox News, or to cable news in general. He has appeared on The First 100 Days, and on the former Fox News program The Kelly File in 2017 to speak about healthcare policy and the ACA. Dr. Emanuel has also made appearances on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. (Scarborough has been known to refer to him as ‘Zeke’) \nFrom January 2009 until January 2011, Dr. Emanuel served as a special adviser on health policy to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and National Economic Council in Pres. Obama’s administration, where he was also one of the architects of the ACA. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and chair of the meta-council on the Future of Health Care Committee for the World Economic Forum. Additionally, Emanuel served on Pres. Bill Clinton ’s Health Care Task Force, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) and on the bioethics panel of the Pan-American Healthcare Organization. \nThese days, Dr. Emanuel is the vice provost for global initiatives, the Diane v.S. Levy and Robert M. Levy University professor and chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and an op-ed contributor to The New York Times. \nHe has authored 6 books and co-edited 7 books, including Reinventing American Health Care: How the Affordable Care Act will Improve our Terribly Complex, Blatantly Unjust, Outrageously Expensive, Grossly Inefficient, Error Prone System, Brothers Emanuel: A Memoir of an American Family and Healthcare, Guaranteed: A Simple, Secure Solution for America. \nDr. Emanuel graduated from Amherst College and later received his M.Sc. from Oxford University in Biochemistry. He earned his M.D. from Harvard Medical School and his Ph.D. in political philosophy from Harvard, where his dissertation received the Toppan Award for the finest political science dissertation of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:15:41.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
