There’s no time to waste! The January transfer windows slams (SLAMS!) shut on Tuesday night shortly after Chelsea’s match against Liverpool, and if we’re to make everyone in the backup goalkeeper department happy, we need to have someone other than Asmir Begović sitting on the bench at Anfield. It could be Eduardo, at least temporarily, but the directive is that we cannot grant Begović his move to Bournemouth until we secure a replacement. Chelsea appear to be trying very hard at what is a bit of an impossible mission — find a team willing to sell a good goalkeeper in the middle of the season — and according to Sky Sports, we’re making another attempt at Celtic’s Craig Gordon.
