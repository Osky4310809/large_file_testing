Twitter Lorac \nCoordinating brunch plans with your friends is stressful enough — so shouldn't getting your brunch look together at least be easy? You are cordially invited to treat yourself to some brunch-themed makeup to help with the glam portion of the morning (which, let's be honest, really means the early afternoon). Lorac 's upcoming Beauties Who Brunch collection is the brunch eyeshadow palette, lip gloss, lipstick, and highlighter selection for any glam girl on the hunt for that perfect Eggs Benedict. \nThe I Heart Brunch eyeshadow palette won us over with its 16 pastel colors and brunch-y names. First, let's talk about Avocado Toast. While it's more of a minty green than an avocado green, we're loving its Tiffany & Co. box vibes, so we'll let it slide. And, if you're that friend who shows up to brunch demanding gluten-free options, don't worry — Lorac has got you covered with a Gluten Free shade (a shimmery off-white). \nFor those who come to brunch ready to eat, shades like Jelly Donut, Sorbet, Blueberry Scone, Smoothie, Pancakes and French Toast, Eggs Benny, and Hot Sauce will definitely fill you up. The palette is rounded out with a shade called Valet for the fancier brunchers among us, and one called Sunday Sunday, brunch's universal day of worship. The palette will go for $44, and it also comes with primer and a brush. Lorac \nThe collection also features the I Heart Brunch Color Source Buildable Blush & Light Source Highlighter ($35). The blush comes in Luma and Panorama, and the highlighter in a bold Limelight. Lorac \nLorac has your lips covered, too. The I Heart Brunch Alter Ego Lipstick ($18) is a highly pigmented lipstick with a satin finish, while the I Heart Brunch Alter Ego Lip Gloss ($17) is also highly pigmented but with a subtle shine. Both lip options come in the colors Foodie, Brunch Queen, Pastry Chef, and Barista. Lorac \nThe full collection will be available at the end of February at Ulta . follow us", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:05:49.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
