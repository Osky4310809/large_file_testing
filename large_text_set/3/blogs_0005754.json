The \"Hello\" songstress received a visit from a bat in November at her Mexico City concert. \"Welcome to Mexico,\" she joked at the time. \"It's really good to be here, but a f--king bat?\" \nAdele's concerts have always been eventful, even when it's not intentional. During the same concert as the mosquito incident, the British singer confirmed she and longtime love Simon Konecki were officially married. \nAt the 2017 Grammys last month, Adele had thanked her \"husband\" in an acceptance speech, fueling longtime speculation that she and Simon, with whom she shares 4-year-old son Angelo , had quietly gotten married. Speculation was also fueled when she and Simon were seen wearing what appeared to be wedding rings. \nBut at her Brisbane concert, Adele said she is \"married now.\" \n\"I was trying to remember how it was I felt at the beginning of the relationship that inspired that record, because as bad as a break up can be, as bitter and horrible and messy as it can be, that feeling when you first fall for someone is the best feeling on earth and I am addicted to that feeling,\" she said onstage. \"Obviously I can't go through with those feelings because I'm married now. I've found my next person.\" \nCongratulations again, Adele!
