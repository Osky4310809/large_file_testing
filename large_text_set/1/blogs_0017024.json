The brave choice came on the heels of the athlete's near fatal overdose and a failed string of attempts to get clean. \nNow that the father of two is officially sober, he's able to realize who was really there for him during the dark times, like his ex-wife Khloé Kardashian . \nWhile last week Odom tearfully revealed he wants Miz Kardashian \"back,\" he just took things even further by declaring he wants to \"repay\" her for all the support. \nLam confessed to Dr. Travis Stork : \n\"When you're doing drugs, you become distant to everything. Even your feelings, you become numb to everything. Just to reinstate what we had as a family, it was important to me. Khloé is important to me. She's been through all this with me. She stood by my side. I just want to repay her.\" \nWell, considering the reality star is currently in a relationship with Tristan Thompson , this might be a little difficult… \nEither way, Lamar is trying to maintain a positive attitude in face of the controversy, declaring: \n\"The most important thing I took away from [rehab] is that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for being.\" \nSo amazing! We really hope the 37-year-old stays clean this time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T02:35:19.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
