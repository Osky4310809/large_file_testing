Pray and ask God where you should “plug in.” It’s the people who really “get plugged in” that find their purpose and soar in their walk with Christ. Sometimes this takes a little time, but most churches offer classes or counseling to help you find the place that’s right for you. Don’t get discouraged if the first thing you try doesn’t seem to fit. Christian Faith in Action \nStep 4 – Pray daily. \nPrayer is simply talking to God. You don’t have to use big fancy words. There are no right and wrong words. Just be yourself. Give thanks to the Lord daily for your salvation. Pray for others in need. Pray for direction. Pray for the Lord to fill you daily with His Holy Spirit. There is no limit to prayer. You can pray with your eyes closed or open, while sitting or standing, kneeling or lying on your bed, anywhere, anytime. So begin to make prayer a part of your daily routine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:59:19.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
