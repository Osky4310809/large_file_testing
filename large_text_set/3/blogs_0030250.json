For one, he likes to practice in a Power Rangers costume from time to time. This time, he’s still punting and he’s in his typical practice gear, but he doesn’t have a football. \nFor Oakland quarterback Derek Carr’s birthday, King punted a damn cake and posted it on Twitter. You can argue that this is a waste of good cake, but sometimes those RTs are as delicious as birthday cake. \nIf you try this, it can work both ways: You can treat this as a fun way of telling a friend happy birthday. But if you’re mad at them, you can also kick a birthday cake. That way, you can express your frustration while still caring for a good friend. Thank you for innovating the birthday gram game, Marquette. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:56:47.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
