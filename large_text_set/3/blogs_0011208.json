'Easier to understand' \nIn an e-mail obtained by The Register technology news website, and seen by the BBC, Home Office staff have been warned to \"avoid commenting on politically controversial issues\" in general and \"giving personal opinions about the organisation\". \nThey were reminded the Home Office's social media guidance had been updated and that they, as well as temporary employees and contractors, must observe the rules on not sharing information about the work of the department or saying they work for the Home Office on personal accounts. Image caption The US president is no stranger to tweeting himself \nIt read: \"A quick look through just a couple of known personal Twitter accounts of staff members shows that some are not compliant, stating that they work for the Home Office, posting HO work, whilst tweeting or retweeting negative posts about, for example, Donald Trump. \n\"We need to be careful here and ensure all our staff are following this guidance which reflects the Civil Service Code.\" \nThe Home Office told the Daily Telegraph that it did not comment on internal correspondence but a spokesman told the newspaper that all staff were expected to adhere to the values and standards of behaviour set out in the code. \n\"This includes the need for political impartiality and also applies to the use of social media,\" it added. \"We recently updated our guidance on the use of social media by staff to make it clearer and easier to understand. \n\"This is in line with the Cabinet Office's guidelines and the changes have been communicated to all staff.\" \nThe Home Office employs more than 25,000 staff.
