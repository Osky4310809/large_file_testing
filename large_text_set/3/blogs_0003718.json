Introduce rules and conduct team competitions. \n\"This way, the aggression of the fans can be directed into a peaceful channel, and set an example for all other countries - including England. \n\"For example, English fans can come and in return the challenge is accepted. [There would be a] meeting at the stadium. On each side, there are 20 people, without weapons. You can see the rules on our website.\" \nLebedev even has a name for his new sport - \"draka\" - which is the Russian word for fight. \n\"Russia would become a pioneer in a new sport,\" he added. \"Of course, there is no need to invent any foreign names: let the word 'draka' enter.\" \nThese suggestions came as Lebedev outlined his frustration at the depiction of Russian fans in the British media. \nCrazy Alexis call backfires on Wenger \n\"They are not at all hooligans,\" he said. \"First of all, they are those who support their clubs with all their heart. \n\"They organise support and propaganda for their clubs: they are connoisseurs, adherents and fans of football in the truest sense of the word. \n\"Yes, they sometimes fight - but only with colleagues. They are not touching the peaceful population. This is different from football hooligans in England.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T21:11:15.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
