In a meeting held by NITI Aayog, the government has asked domestic companies including Micromax, Intex, Lava and Karbonn to manufacture low-cost smartphones to bring digital transactions to the masses. \nThree people aware of the discussions told Economic Times that only local manufacturers have been approached for this project. Chinese players have not been approached, while Samsung and Apple didn’t attend the meeting. “The government has begun enabling digital transactions, which are growing exponentially now, but they realize that there aren’t that many low-cost smartphones in the market,” said the industry executives aware of the meeting. \nThe report said that the government’s aim is to allow financial transactions from anywhere. The devices that it has asked local companies to make will have the ability to scan for Aadhaar-based financial transactions in the future. The government is pushing handset companies to launch 20 to 25 million handsets into the market, and has ruled out government subsidy. \nAs of now, in India, 3G smartphones are available at starting prices of around Rs 2,500, while budget 4G phones start at approx. Rs 4000. The domestic vendors that attended the meeting have not yet announced their plans to launch the affordable smartphones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T09:32:37.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
