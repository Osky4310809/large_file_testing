People said it was celebrating cutting women’s pay on IWD. @AusChamber Your logic is disingenuous at best & you celebrate cutting women's pay on #IWD2017? Back inside your cave.\n— Sandi Logan (@SandiHLogan) ID: 10660001 .@AusChamber me thinking how paying women less is a good thing\n— )))TG o((( (@TG_Chrono) ID: 10660023 @AusChamber #women will take home less due to lower #penaltyrates Yet business will rake profits not workers #auspol trickle down is a lie\n— Tracey Withhope (@traceywithhope) ID: 10660076 .@AusChamber Happy International Women's Day from the people who want to cut our pay. The same ppl who DO NOT work weekends. Bravo. #fail\n— Leanne Shingles (@LeanneShingles) ID: 10660077 @AusChamber\n— Emmet (@Emmet_Fay) ID: 10660079 11. The inclusion of the hashtag #BeBoldForChange wasn’t a hit either. @AusChamber if you're so bold for change, why aren't there more women on your board?\n— DukeLongley (@DukeLongley) ID: 10660018 A new poll of 3,515 residents in the federal electorates of Brisbane, Corangamite, Dawson, Page and Leichhardt found 66% of female voters and 58% of male voters disapproved of the penalty rate cuts.\nIt also found women were more cynical about the proposed effect of the cuts, with 35% believing they would result in more jobs for the affected industries, compared with 42% of men.\nID: 10659978 13. Following the deluge of responses, the chamber DOUBLED DOWN on its underemployment message, tweeting a graph of who wants more hours by gender and sector. Underemployment disproportionately affects women. #BeBoldForChange\n— Australian Chamber (@AusChamber) ID: 10659935 14. “Underemployment disproportionately affects women,” the tweet read. But again, people were unconvinced.
