These were introduced in the US last December featuring hybrid dual-dynamic and balanced armature drivers. They also feature a full metal, wired control bar and built-in microphone to take calls on the go. \nThe Xiaomi Mi In-Ear Headphones Pro HD’s dual-dynamic drivers are responsible for lower audio ranges, while the smaller dynamic drivers handle the higher audio ranges. It gets a three-button in-line remote, 45-degree angled in-ear design, TPE wiring for cables for durability and comes with four pairs of differently sized rubber tips for a comfy fit. \nThe Mi In-Ear Headphones Pro HD have been priced at Rs 1,999, and will be available on Mi.com starting today in silver hue.
