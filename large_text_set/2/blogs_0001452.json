Call 999 if you believe you are being pursued by a fake police car (Photo: Getty) Does an unmarked police car have the power to stop vehicles? \nThe answer is yes. But the officer must be wearing uniform in order to carry out the stop. Do the police need a reason to stop me? \nNo, they don't need a reason. The police have the power to stop any vehicle and ask for your name and date of birth and to see your driving licence, insurance and MoT documents. These can usually be shown later at a police station. A genuine police officer will have no problem showing you his or her warrant card (Photo: Getty) Read More Crash bride and groom get a lift to their wedding reception in a police car What if I am not sure it is really a police car? \nThe advice from Devon and Cornwall Police is that anyone unsure whether the car flashing them is the police, then do not stop. \nAnyone who is not 100% sure it is a genuine police car is advised to drive the nearest police station or public place, such as a petrol station. In remote areas, the driveway of a clearly occupied house could do at a push. The answer is not to stop anywhere secluded. \nIf in doubt, call 999. The police can always check if one of their cars is following you. \nEven if you decide not to stop straightaway and have to wait for a safe place to pull over, motorists are advised to signal to the police car that you have acknowledged the request. \nDo not drive off at great speed making the police think you are trying to get away.

Have your mobile at hand just in case. \nYou can ask to see a warrant card, which should carry the police officer's name and photograph, through the closed window. \nThe advice is always to stay safe and in an emergency, do not hesitate to call 999.
