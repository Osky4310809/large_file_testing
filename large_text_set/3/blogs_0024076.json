TMZ reports that the Roc Nation signee could be facing up to two years in jail if he is convicted for the charges he is facing. \nMensa is being prosecuted for carrying a loaded, unregistered handgun and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. He is scheduled for a court hearing next month. \nThe 23-year-old rapper was reportedly pulled over after cruising through the hills for running a stop sign and illegal tints. Authorities then found a loaded gun inside the car. Mensa provided a concealed carry permit, but it was for another state. He spent one night in jail before posting $35,000 bail.
