Let’s break it all down. \nOathkiller was a gift to Brienne by everyone’s favorite one-armed villain since “The Fugitive,” Jaime Lannister. Giphy \nLast time we saw Jaime, he was shooting a look at Cersei, who basically used Westeros’ version of an atom bomb, wildfire, on all of her enemies and a few unfortunate churchgoers. \nThe look told us Jaime thinks Cersei has lost her goddamn mind — she used wildfire on civilians, something he previously killed the Mad King in order to prevent. \nHe also thinks she’s responsible for the death of their son Tommen, who threw himself off a building because his queen turned into a pile of green ash (not a marijuana reference). \nAnd who is friends/friends with hot tub benefits with Jaime? Brienne. Giphy \nOne Reddit user named B1llyW1tchDoctor thinks Brienne is going to be recruited to murder Cersei by Jaime, who can’t do it himself, \nBrienne does it. Jaime and Brienne make eye contact and Jaime has the power to stop her but he nods his head in approval and lets Brienne go through with it. \nNow, you might think this would be at odds with the witch’s prophecy foretelling Cersei’s demise at the hands of her “little brother,” but I think it still works. \nIf Jaime asks Brienne to do the deed (Jaime may be Cersei’s twin, but he’s technically younger), he’s still responsible for her death. \nAlso, the word the witch actually uses, “valonqar,” is High Valyrian for younger brother. \nOathkeeper is her younger brother’s old Valyrian sword. \nCoincidence? Maybe. We’ll just have to wait until July to find out. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
