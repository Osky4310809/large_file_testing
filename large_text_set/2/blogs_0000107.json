Following her recent contribution to Discwoman and Allergy Season's Physically Sick protest compilation , the mix traverses a low-swung range of breakbeat and house experiments, impressively touching on an array of rhythm patterns and moods without losing a sense of underlying consistency. \nThe event is billed as a reinterpretation of the Chinese Lunar New Year tradition of family reunion, focused on a celebration of \" our chosen families and our queer Asian-American diasporic families ,\" according to the event page . It is co-presented by Discwoman and the queer and intersectional Yellow Jackets Collective and will take place at chef Danny Bowien's Mission Chinese Food restaurant, also featuring sets from Haruka Salt , DeSe , MIN2, and NK Badtz Maru. \nLunar New Year took place this past Saturday on January 28, ringing in the year of the Rooster as the event's title suggests. \nQueer Lunar New Year Mix tracklist: \n1. dj tn cap - whitney flip2.
