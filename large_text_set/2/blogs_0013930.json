The Microsoft CEO along with Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal announced that the companies are teaming up to be partners on the cloud. This move essentially means that Flipkart, from now, will only be using Microsoft Azure as the public cloud service. This decision of Microsoft going into a strategic partnership with India’s biggest online marketplace was taken to expand e-commerce in the country, according to Nadella. While speaking at the event, Nadella emphasised the importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning when it comes to transforming businesses, while Bansal highlighted on the ways in which such technologies can be used by Flipkart. \nFlipkart will be adopting Microsoft Azure as an exclusive public cloud platform, a decision which was announced by Nadella and Bansal at an event in Bangalore. Nadella said, “At Microsoft, we aim to empower every Indian and every Indian organisation with technology and key to this is forging strategic partnerships with innovative companies like Flipkart. He added, “Combining Microsoft’s cloud platform and AI capabilities with Flipkart’s existing services and data assets, will enable Flipkart to accelerate its digital transformation in e-commerce and deliver new customer experiences.” \nMicrosoft Azure will provide an additional layer of advanced cloud technology and analytics to the e-commerce platform’s current data centres. Microsoft has a great presence in India as well as the world which will allow Flipkart to grow and expand globally and that might lead to a long time partnership in the future. Binny Bansal, at the event, said, “Flipkart has always been committed to its vision of transforming commerce in India through technology. Given Microsoft’s strong reputation in cloud computing, coupled with scale and reliability, this partnership allows us to leverage our combined strength and knowledge of technology, e-commerce and markets to make online shopping more relevant and enriching for customers.” Bansal also claimed that Flipkart recently crossed the 100 million customer mark. With such a huge user base, Microsoft’s expertise in cloud computing and its sheer scale will only help the growth of the company. Flipkart in a press release wrote: “Flipkart plans to leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics capabilities in Azure, such as Cortana Intelligence Suite and Power BI, to optimise its data for innovative merchandising, advertising, marketing and customer service.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:39:45.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
