As reported by Expressen (h/t Manchester Evening News ' Charlotte Duncker ), the Sweden international was linked heavily with a move to Old Trafford during the January window, with reports suggesting a deal was very close. Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images Manager Jose Mourinho opted not to sign Lindelof, however, although he's expected to return for his services at the end of the season. The 22-year-old has signed a new contract with the Portuguese giants since the January window closed, and per the report, he's confident it was the right decision: \nIt feels good that I extended my stay by one year. I enjoy playing for the club and feel I evolve every day there. It was an easy choice. \nBoth parties were very happy and they wanted to give me a sign that they are satisfied with what I've done there. \nMuch has been written but it's nothing I have focused on. I have always focused on what was important to me and that's the team. [The rumours] make no difference to me. \nAs I've said I've been thriving at Benfica and thatâ€™s where the focus has been. A lot has been written and I've said nothing, I've been focused. \nI have a long contract at Benfica and I'm thriving there. It's a big club and I'm developing every day. I'm only 22 years old and there is no stress [to push through a move]. Lindelof's new contract contains a higher release clause than his previous deal, according to O Jogo (h/t Daily Mirror 's James Whaling ). That's a significant blow for United chances of landing the defender, but it shouldn't rule out a transfer. Gualter Fatia/Getty Images The youngster has impressed during his time in Portugal, as he has steadily developed into a strong, all-round defender with solid athleticism and excellent vision. He has all of the physical tools to succeed at the position and a sky-high ceiling thanks to his versatility and ability with the ball at his feet. Bleacher Report UK's Sam Tighe gave a short description of the player: Bleacher Report UK @br_uk 3/5/2017, 8:13:18 PM Here's a look at some of his highlights: Duncker remains very confident Mourinho will target the Swede in the summer, and despite the improved contract, there's a sense Lindelof's move to Old Trafford is inevitable. He'll have to keep impressing in Portugal in the meantime, however.
