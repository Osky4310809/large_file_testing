But no decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate. We will let you know as soon as a decision is final.\"\nRebecca Ferguson stated on Jan. 10 that she had declined to participate at the ceremony for Trump, dropping a hint that she wasn't allowed to sing a song of her choice.\nThe 30-year-old UK singer had stated she would participate so long as she could sing the song Strange Fruit, a 1939 song originally sung by Billie Holiday.\nThe song's lyrics deal with racism in the 1930s in America and is based on an Abel Metropol poem. \nIn a statement Ferguson said: \"There are many grey areas about the offer for me to perform that I'm unable to share right now, but I will not be singing.\"\nOne of the very few names confirmed for next week's inauguration is Jackie Evancho, a runner up on America's Got Talent in 2010. \nShe will be singing the national anthem. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T16:43:35.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
