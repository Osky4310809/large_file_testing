Last night didn't really bear a lot of relation to Sunday. \n\"It was an exercise in something else: one or two people getting games; Tom (Cairney) getting a start and introducing him to people. \n\"So I don't really feel there was much that I saw that is relative to Sunday. \n\"We have known all along the importance of Sunday night and have a totally different way of thinking about Sunday than we did last night.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:55:07.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
