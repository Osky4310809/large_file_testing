There's one problem though if you don't have a Pixel phone: it's not available for other Android devices. We'll let you know when it does, but for now you can always read on to find out how to download the APK. Pixel Launcher: install using APK \nBefore we begin, we should remember that Google said the Pixel Launcher would be exclusive to their new Pixel models. Therefore, the only way to install it on other smartphones is by using APK files, for which the user must have a certain level of knowledge and take particular care when using. The APK for Pixel is not endorsed by Google and was discovered by the editing team at Android Police. \nThe developers who provided the APK verified that the executable content is harmless and that it only contains the launcher and its resources. We have tested the APK on some of our editorial staff's smartphones and it seems the Pixel Launcher can be used without any problems. On the other hand, given that we aren't responsible for the file, we can't guarantee that it will or will not work on your device. \nRemember that you have to go to security settings on your Android and activate the option \"Unknown sources\". Once activated, you'll be able to download apps that canâ€™t be found in the Play Store. Also remember, we do not recommend nor encourage the use of pirated content. Downloading and installing Pixel Launcher \nIn order to be able to use Pixel Launcher on your device, you'll need to download two APK files. The first is the launcher and its settings, such as widgets, Google Now and other resources. The second is a new wallpaper system, which periodically downloads high resolution images.
