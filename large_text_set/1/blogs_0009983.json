To see why it is complicate we can perform the described calculation for two spins (exactly). But after we get the quantum effective action, we find that there is no phase transition and no SSB. We also do the calculation for three spins, again no SSB. Magically, for large $N$ spins (or when $N=\\infty$), phase transition and SSB do appear. The above understanding is certainly correct, but I wonder if there is a more direct and a deeper way to see SSB. – Xiao-Gang Wen Jun 2 '12 at 2:49 1 This has nothing to with quantum mechanics. A classical system of N (finite) spins does not have a phase transition either. – Thomas Jun 2 '12 at 15:39 1 +1, This is also how I also imagined SSB (i.e., for @Xiao-GangWen's example of the 1D quantum Ising model, the partition function is equivalent to the classical 2D Ising model and the SSB is inherited). At the level of wild conjecture, this seems to suggest that SSB in a model that does not have a classical (sign-free) effective action requires a radically different explanation, though. – wsc Jun 6 '12 at 17:50 1 @wsc: You have a very good point. A quantum system correspond to a statistical system only if the path integral description of the quantum system is a path integral over a positive definite functional. If the path integral is not positive definite, the quantum system has no statistical analogue, but it still has SSB. – Xiao-Gang Wen Jun 7 '12 at 10:52 @Thomas: Here, we are talking about quantum phase transition or SSB phase transition at ZERO temperature. At zero temperature, a classical system of $N$ (finite) spins does have a phase transition as we change parameters, such as $B$ in the transverse-field Ising model. – Xiao-Gang Wen Jun 7 '12 at 10:56 up vote 4 down vote \nOne possible understanding of SSB in quantum systems may be the following: we all know that classically there is a ground state manifold and one can choose to locate the ground state on one point which breaks the symmetry. However, in quantum systems, due to superposition principle one can form linear combinations that restore the symmetry. However, SSB means that for the low-energy states, there are a certain basis (which are the \"classical\" states), such that, if one looks at the matrix elements of local physical operators(operators with local support) between different basis states they always vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This may provide a quantum characterization of SSB, although I'm not fully confident that this is sufficient and necessary. Finite size effect may be included by considering how the matrix elements scales with the system size. \nObviously there are some hand-wavingness in the above definition, since we are talking about \"basis\" for only low-energy states. But I still find it a useful way of understanding SSB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-15T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T16:08:12.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
