(To be clear, the fact that his appearance was a birthday gift also appeared to surprise E-40.) \nNevertheless, with Sluricanes in hand, 40 delivered an impromptu celebratory toast for Mai and the other hosts, Tamera Mowry, Loni Love, and Adrienne Bailon. \nThe veteran rapper also talked a little bit about his life, touching on his 25-year marriage to Tracy Stevens and his friendship with fellow West Coast rapper Tupac. \nAs E-40 says, Tupac had an extremely dedicated work ethic. \n\"You know, Tupac would go into the studio and make like six or seven songs in one day,\" he said. \"That's how he operated. He was real quick with his pen.\" \nSee the whole clip above.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T03:38:08.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
