If you don't agree, and I have full respect for him, then you have to go Iain Duncan Smith \nM r Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that civil servants are now having to \"tear up the rulebook\" for how they normally operate to deal with Brexit. \nHe said: \"They are now having to accept and understand that we are leaving and that means therefore sometimes the views and the opinions of what you keep feeding back from various member states isn't actually sometimes quite relevant.\" \nHe went on: \"It's well and good, absolutely right, to feed that back, but ministers have to sift that and decide ultimately no, what we are going to do is this, and we therefore have to get on and do it like this. \n\"If you don't agree, and I have full respect for him, then you have to go.\" \nMr Duncan Smith also suggested Sir Ivan had undermined his position by \"going public\" too often.
