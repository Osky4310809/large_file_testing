Entering the evening, the Wild trailed the Blackhawks by seven points with one game in hand but now only nine games to go. The Wild cut their magic number for clinching at least a wild-card spot to two. \nSan Jose’s arrival represented the fourth opponent among the NHL’s top seven teams over the Wild’s last six games, but the Sharks brought their own problems with only two goals in their previous three games, all regulation losses. \nAnaheim, Edmonton and Calgary have surged into contention for the Pacific Division title, too, shrinking the Sharks’ lead to four points over the Ducks and Oilers, and five points over the Flames. \nDumba became the 11th player to reach the 10-goal mark for the Wild this season, matching his career high with a roof-of-the-net shot set up by a stretched-out, one-touch pass from Zach Parise after Eric Staal plucked the puck off the boards. The Wild have the most potent home power play in the league, entering the game with a conversion rate of nearly 30 percent. \nMinnesota held a 16-4 edge in shots on goal at one point, before letting the Sharks find their footing. Jones helped by making some sharp saves, and Schlemko’s wrist shot from the blue line with 2:03 left in the second period tied the game after the puck blew through traffic and bounced off Wild defenseman Marco Scandella. \nHanzal answered with his first goal in 10 games with the Wild since being acquired in a trade with Arizona, and Coyle followed off another setup by Parise with a one-timer for a 3-1 lead before Marleau brought the Sharks closer. \nNOTES: Jones gave up more than two goals for the first time in nine games. … The Wild swept the season series, winning all three games, for the first time in their history. They’re 9-1-1 against San Jose in the last 11 meetings at home. … The Wild have gone 11 straight home games without allowing a power-play goal. \nUP NEXT \nSan Jose: The Sharks continue their four-game Central Division tour with another visit on Friday to Dallas for a strange second meeting this week with the Stars. \nMinnesota: The Wild play the second leg on their three-game homestand Thursday, hosting the Philadelphia Flyers. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T06:26:21.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
