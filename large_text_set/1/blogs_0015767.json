The network will be debuting its show Powerless , a comedy set in the DC Universe that follows a security firm who deals with the fallout of heroic battles. Given its connection to DC Comics, fans have wondered what canon heroes or villains would make themselves known in the show, and now one old-school character has made itself known. \nEarlier today, Powerless debuted a brand-new trailer that is filled with references to iconic characters like Batman, Wonder Woman, and more. However, during a brief clip, comic book readers were stunned to spot a classic villain who liked to bully the Justice League of America . \nThat’s right! Starro will make an appearance in Powerless , and the alien creature gets a nice feature in the new Powerless trailer. The star-shaped behemoth can be seen clinging to a building before it jettisons a pile of goop at a poor woman’s apartment. \nOf course, Starro is a rather well-known villain to comic readers. Having debuted in the Silver Age of Comics, Starro has a long history of appearances in both comics and animated projects. The alien debuted back in 1960 and wreaked havoc amongst Earth until folks like Aquaman put a stop to him. \nIn a world where humanity must cope with the collateral damage of Super Heroes and Super-Villains, Emily Locke (Vanessa Hudgens) begins her first day as Director of Research & Development for Wayne Security, a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises that specializes in products that make defenseless bystanders feel a little safer. Full of confidence and big ideas, Emily quickly learns that her expectations far exceed those of her new boss (Alan Tudyk) and officemates, so it will be up to her to lead the team toward their full potential and the realization that you don’t need superpowers to be a hero. \nThe cast features Vanessa Hudgens, Alan Tudyk, Danny Pudi, Christina Kirk, and Ron Funches. \nJustin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, Len Goldstein, Marc Buckland and Dean Lorey are executive producers of Powerless . Buckland served as the director of the pilot. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television and is based on the characters from DC.
