It can be seriously intimidating. The chiffon yellow, sky blue, and lilac purple may seem like they couldn't realistically fit into your everyday makeup routine. But trust and believe the pastel shades can. A couple of Allure editors, myself included, played around with the new palette on a recent session of Facebook Live and quickly realized just how versatile it is. Each of the eight matte shades are buildableâ€”you can use to add a sheer wash of color on your lids or build them up with a wet brush for a more intensely bold look. We tried both. Another thing we learned: Primer, like the Too Faced Shadow Insurance , helps the shades look more vibrant. As for each color, we have some notes for you to keep in mind. Star (the bumble bee yellow) and Skull (a bright white) are great highlighting shades. I used them in the inner corners of my eyes, as well as my brow bones, and my almond-shaped eyes looked wider than usual. Clementine (a peach) and Meow (a lilac) make for a kickass neutral shades. They look supersoft when brushed onto the crease. Dope (a gray eggplant) is, well, a dope hue to use in the outer corners to add definition to your look. Doom (sky blue) and Gloom (sage green) look amazing on darker skin tones. You can also wet an angled liner brush and create a bright winged liner with them. As for Dagger (a slate gray), you can basically do anything. It's your standard gray with a hint of blue.
