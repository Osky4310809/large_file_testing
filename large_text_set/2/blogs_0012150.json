God makes me gaga, the day I met Ann and her pals. It was on a day of serene nature full of tranquillity, awashed with aquatic splendour. The day I saw women in their full regalia. It was awesome. At the rush hour for lectures at Federal polytechnic oko, Anambra state, students ruin the streets, rushing for their lectures in their various departments. I was busy with my Ipad phone listening to the polyphonic sounds of Patoranking new album (God over everything). Never knowing that God has something bigger for me. \nMoving with the music step, I bumped into four gorgeous ladies who were rushing for lectures not knowing, though they might know that their invaluable secret dazzling body is off to consumption. I looked at them the second time, making sure I was myself and what I saw stands real. I laughed, my two balls kicked up to happiness because I haven’t seen any like that. I raised my hands up for greetings; snub is all I got from them. Looking at their bump-shorts and their tiny spaghetti, I was tempted to touch the god given fruit they bear on their chest. They graced me with a smooth-hot and palatable slap I can ever imagine. Lady with big Boobs \n\nThe sky turned blue and red all of a sudden, perhaps see tiny-tiny stars whooshing out through my eyes. I paused, closed my eyes and opened it the second time it was mild. I took a race to them looking at the door they took. It was the department of mass communication, third year. I was propelled to return home and inform my lads on the latest. They laughed through their noise and told me that I am not man enough. After their noisy creamy talks. They asked me about those ‘slappers’ which I told them everything. They quickly got up, prepared and left for school. I stood for a minute, and then dashed out to school. We met at the door post of the department. Lectures were over, students coming out from their classrooms. These fellows dashed to our sight, speedily I pointed at them for my pals to have a revenge for me. \nWe followed them till we reached a lonely place, were to my surprise, Nnamdi walked at one (though you know what I mean when a boy and a girl dashes two aside). Then the rest of us without me trooped in to rape. \nThe following day, it was reported that four girls were identifiably raped by street boys. Going by the information gotten from the victims, it was all about nudity and pornographic clothes girls wear to schools in tertiary institutions .This is however due to the increase in social plat forms participation like tweeter, facebook, instagram etc and the fashion gotten from celebrities. The vice chancellor quickly made a law for dress codes which every student must abide. Now the question, have students desists from wearing nude clothes in schools despites the effect they accrue from it?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:27:36.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
