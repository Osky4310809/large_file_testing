One Way Stock/Flickr.com By Nadra Kareem Nittle \nBeing labeled a racist is far from pleasant and sometimes it’s unwise to label a person as such . But when someone displays wildly insensitive behavior of a racial nature, there’s no getting around the R-word, or is there? No matter how inappropriately some people behave when it comes to race, they insist there’s absolutely no way they’re racist. These folks typically trot out a trite list of reasons to defend themselves against racism accusations. You’ve no doubt heard some of these excuses before. They range from the declaration that some of their best friends are black to mentions of the good deeds they’ve done for minorities over the years. Unfortunately, none of these excuses mean that a person is free of racist attitudes. This list breaks down why an individual can have black friends and be racist and other misperceptions about what makes someone a bigot or not. I’m Not Racist; I’ve Dated Interracially \nOne would hope that people who date or marry across racial lines would not harbor racist attitudes, but openness to interracial relationships is no guarantee that they won’t. Take, for example, the band Day Above Ground. In Summer 2013, the Los Angeles group ignited a firestorm because of its song “Asian Girlz,” which features stereotypical lyrics about Asian-American women while sexualizing them in a racially charged fashion. The kicker was that some members of the band had Asian-American girlfriends, a sign that dating interracially doesn’t necessarily make one more racially sensitive or enlightened than anyone else. In addition to this, former CNN personality Lou Dobbs’ views on immigration have been branded racist and xenophobic despite his marriage to Latina. Moreover, celebrities such as Halle Berry and Terrence Howard have each accused their non-black exes of racism. Particularly Berry and Howard said both of their exes used the N-word. This demonstrates that interracial romance is hardly the antidote to racism. One can be a bigot and date across the color line. Some of My Best Friends Are Black \nScores of public figures have defended themselves against racism accusations by stressing that “some of my best friends are black.” Sorry, but this excuse simply doesn’t hold water. For one, let’s define “friend.” Study after study indicates that Americans typically don’t have close friends of another race, so do these “black friends” alleged racists like to mention really exist or are they merely acquaintances or, worse, employees of the accused? Before Laura “Dr. Laura” Schlessinger said the N-word several times on her radio show in August 2010 she made a point to mention that her black bodyguard was her “dear friend.” After neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman killed 17-year-old black youth Trayvon Martin in February 2012, his representatives made a point to mention his black friend Joe Olvier. However, having a black friend does not mean that Zimmerman didn’t racially profile Trayvon as dangerous. Academic Noliwe Rooks pointed out in Time magazine in April 2012: \n“When scholars have studied the racial beliefs, feelings and policy views of whites who have contact with blacks as friends, acquaintances or neighbors, they consistently find that the negative racial perceptions of those whites are substantially similar to the perceptions of whites who have no black friends. Friendship with black people — and even being a black person — does nothing to change racial bias. Indeed, almost one-third of black people hold similarly negative views.” I Help The Disadvantaged \nHelping the less fortunate is great, but one can still be racist and serve communities of color. This especially becomes clear if one looks at the dictionary definition of racism, which in a nutshell asserts that racism is the notion that one race is inferior to another. Serving minorities in impoverished communities in the U.S. or abroad in no way challenges this dynamic. People may be motivated to help a disadvantaged member of a minority group precisely because they believe the group is inferior and needs their assistance. In fact there’s a term for this phenomenon. It’s called “white man’s burden.” According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “white man’s burden” is “the alleged duty of the white peoples to manage the affairs of the less developed nonwhite peoples.” Writer Rudyard Kipling coined the term in an 1899 poem of the same name. My Family is Multicultural \nHaving interracial romances and friendships doesn’t mean someone’s not a racist, and the same holds true for the person who has family members of another race. Adopting a child from another race, becoming grandparent to a biracial child, etc., doesn’t instantly transform a person into Martin Luther King Jr. President Barack Obama, for example, said that while his white grandmother undoubtedly loved him, she also “confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and…on more than one occasion…uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.” Clearly a person can have a blood relative of another race and still harbor racial stereotypes and make racially offensive statements. One would hope that a relative of a racial minority would make an effort to view the full humanity of others, but there’s no guarantee that family members of people of color will take measures to eliminate their race-based biases. Given this, it’s unacceptable for such people to argue that they can’t be racist due to the color of their relatives’ skin. I Don’t Hate Anyone \nThere’s a persistent idea that for one to be racist one must hate a particular racial group. The fact is that hatred is not a requirement for racism. It’s wonderful if you’ve never committed a hate crime against a racial group or refrain from using racial slurs such as the N-word, but that doesn’t mean you’re not a bigot. If you view a group in largely stereotypical terms or feel afraid or uncomfortable when you encounter members of a certain racial group, you may indeed be racially prejudiced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:11:39.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
