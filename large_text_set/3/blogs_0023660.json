So he sent a letter to Brandon Brooks asking if the Birds offensive lineman - and fellow Miami of Ohio product - would be a guest at the occasion. \n\"As a 2007 graduate of Miami University, a Delaware valley native, and a lifelong Eagles fan, my fiancé and I would be thrilled to have you join us at our wedding,\" Lane wrote. \"Throughout your first year in Philadelphia you have demonstrated what it means to be a Miamian and an Eagle. You continually exhibit the love, honor, resilience and toughness that make Miamians and Philadelphians such special people.
