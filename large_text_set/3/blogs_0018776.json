In the message, Wright defends his name, denies his involvement and goes on to accuse police of what he says are wrongful accusations. \nBaltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton posted a clip of the video on Twitter. \n— Justin Fenton (@justin_fenton) March 20, 2017 \nAntonio Wright is accused of throwing two Molotov Cocktails into a home in the 1200 block of Greenmount Ave., leading to the deaths of two teenagers. \nPolice identified the victims 19-year-old Shi-Heem Sholto and 17-year-old Tyrone James. \nPolice released surveillance video on Sunday, showing a person, who they believe to be Wright, throwing two Molotov cocktails into the home. \nAuthorities are offering a combined offer of $12,000 for information that could lead to Wright’s arrest. \nThe heinous crime that ended two young lives and could have killed more is caught on tape. \nThe video shows the moment police say, Antonio Wright allegedly kicks in the front door of a northeast Baltimore rowhome and sets it on fire. Two teenagers were killed and six others injured, including a 4-year-old and an 11-year-old. \nPolice are branding 26-year-old Antonio Wright as ‘Public Enemy Number One,’ after Saturday’s fire. \nFederal investigators and Metro Crime Stopper are now offering a $12,000 reward for information that leads to his capture. \n“He just didn’t give a damn who was in that house, didn’t care. Right. So I think society. When society sees that, society wants him to rot in jail. Under the jail,” says Baltimore City Police Commissioner Kevin Davis. \nAt a vigil Sunday night, the mother of slain teen Shi-Heem Sholto is grieving and calling for justice. She says her son did not deserve to die in such a cruel way. She wants Wright behind bars. \nFriends and family are mourning 19-year-old Sholto and 17-year-old Tyrone James. Sholto’s mother says, at first, she had no clue her son was involved. \n“I felt for whoever’s child was in that house. You know? But I didn’t know that it was my son. I can’t get him back,” says Karleen Sholto. \nFriends and family at the vigil tell WJZ they don’t believe the teenagers were the intended targets and are demanding answers. \nPolice say the arson was in revenge for a shooting in the area, just two days prior. No one died in that incident. \nPolice say Wright has a violent criminal history. The teenagers did not live in the home, so it’s not clear at this time what they were doing there. \nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Wright and Metro Crime Stoppers have announced an additional $2,000 reward. \nPolice say all but one of the six other people who were injured in the fire have been released from the hospital. \nA 20-year-old woman who jumped from the burning building remains in the hospital in critical condition. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook Amy Yensi Amy Yensi joined WJZ Eyewitness News in March 2015 as a general assignment reporter.
