The Queens rapper’s shot at rival Remy Ma, “No Frauds,” hit the top of the Hip Hop and R&B digital sales chart in its debut, knocking Bruno Mars’ hit “That’s What I Like” to #2 status with Canadian crooner The Weeknd creeping on a come up with “I Feel It Coming” at the third spot. \nMinaj, no stranger to dominating charts, has all the songs from her “3 Pack From Paris” singles release sitting in the top five for sales this week. Migos is still holding strong in the top 10 with “Bad and Boujee” and Future’s “Mask Off” dropped slightly from last week. Nicki Minaj Debuts At #1 With “No Frauds” \nDespite some considering Nicki Minaj’s “No Frauds” reply track to Remy Ma’s “SHETHER” as lukewarm, the Barbs got behind the Lil Wayne and Drake-assisted single with 78,861 sold in its first week. The debut knocks the resilient Bruno Mars down a peg and it appears the single’s momentum spread to Minaj’s other “3 Pack From Paris” tracks, which all shared in the success. Bruno Mars Knocked Down To #2 \nMars’ “That’s What I like” had a good run in the digital R&B/Hip-Hop sales charts in the past few weeks and is just under selling gold at 490,036 copies scanned. The 18 percent drop in sales still netted the Hawaiian star 77,631 copies scanned this week. The Weeknd Moves Up Two Spots To #3 \nThe Weeknd’s Daft Punk-assisted “I Feel It Coming” was at the five spot last week, but made a 77 percent uptick in sales with 54,804 copies scanned. The second single from the Canadian star’s Starboy album was released last November and has sold over 500,000 copies after 17 weeks on the charts.
