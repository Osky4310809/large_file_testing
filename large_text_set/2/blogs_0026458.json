I'm still not entirely sure which bit is the holster sensor, and which is the sidearm. The rather sexy Taser X2. The Taser X26P. The Signal Performance Power Magazine, which slots into the aforementioned Tasers. Axon, the body cam division of Taser International, has announced Signal Sidearm, a gun holster sensor that detects when a weapon has been removed from a holster and automatically prompts all nearby body cams to start recording.\nThe Signal Sidearm, despite its slightly confusing name and provided artwork, isn't a pricey, complex smart weapon, but rather a sensor that can be retrofitted into \"most existing firearm holsters.\" The sensor is powered by a coin cell battery that lasts approximately 1.5 years. It sounds like the sensor is technologically very simple, which hopefully means it's also very reliable.\nFurther Reading Body cams to be worn by more than 22,000 London cops after rollout delay When a weapon is drawn from the holster, the Signal Sidearm tells any Axon camera within 30 feet to start recording. If there are multiple Axon cameras present, they all start recording, providing video footage from a variety of angles.\nAxon is most famous for its body-worn (or spectacles-mounted) cameras, which are worn by UK and US police, but it also sells dash cams that are used on some police vehicles. Oddly, the Axon site doesn't mention whether the sensor will also work with British police truncheons.\nThe Signal Performance Power Magazine, which slots into the aforementioned Tasers. Signal Sidearm joins two other \"Signal\" products. Signal Vehicle can be configured to broadcast a wireless \"start recording!\" message when the car door opens, or when the police lights or siren are activated. And the Signal Performance Power Magazine is a replacement battery pack for the Taser X2 and X26P that tells nearby cameras to start recording when the weapon is armed, and also logs the exact moment the trigger is pulled.\nThe whole point of the Axon Signal tech is to hopefully increase the reliability of police body-worn camera footage. If the cameras start recording at pre-defined triggers, require little manual intervention, and there is redundancy built into the system via multiple sensors—siren, car door, holster, magazine—then there's a lower chance of an incident not being recorded.\nFurther Reading The best dash cams: How and why you should invest in a dash cam Of course, if the sensors aren't properly maintained or camera footage is accidentally deleted , then automatic recording tech isn't all that useful. But hey, one step at a time.\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK \nListing image by Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:55:59.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
