It’s the slowness of life in Ireland coupled with the small town and quaint feel you get across the whole of the island. There’s also the Guinness, whiskey, and pub grub that makes Irish pubs some of the best places to tip back the ol’ tipple on the planet. The Irish Pub takes its time to talk with pub owners about their life, work, and devotion to not just getting people drunk, but providing the neighborhood with an escape from the doldrums of day-to-day life. Watching this one is a grand way to spend an afternoon, then head on down to your local pub. \nAdd To Netflix Queue \n5) Somm \nMadness is often the greatest attribute of an artist. Somm follows five guys as they study for their Master Sommelier exams . After watching this you’ll want to bow down before the next Master Somm you encounter as if they’re Zod. It really takes a little bit of insanity to pursue such a massively difficult qualification. Yet, you find these guys are just trying to carve out a life for themselves in the world. Commendable. Still crazy.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \n\n4) For Grace \nWhy do we grind ourselves to a pulp with our work, our passions, our desires?

They leave their families for six months to live in seclusion at the still. The film is immersive as you dine, work and mourn with these craftsmen. A beauty to watch, and simple in its approach, you’ll never look at saké the same way again.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \n\n2) Noma: My Perfect Storm \nNoma is a controversial place. The film follows René Redzepi as he guides his signature restaurant through Michelin rankings, health scares, and Best Restaurant In The World competitions.

It’s a fascinating peek behind the curtain of a mythical restaurant.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \n1) Jiro Dreams of Sushi \nJiro’s world renowned sushi begs the question: does perfection exist?\nThis documentary is a juggernaut of food and film. It tells a remarkable story of a man’s odyssey to create something truly unique, then maintain it, and then pass it on to his son. As Jiro’s journey winds down, you have to wonder if he ever had an off day. Or maybe he was one of those sprites who had that touch of magic which allowed him to elevate a street food novelty into high culinary art with relative ease. All that is clear is sushi is the mountaintop, and it seems lonely up there.\nAdd To Netflix Queue \nFor everything else you should be streaming on Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, check out our comprehensive What To Watch guide.
