More by Julie Shaw Arrow icon \nA 21-year-old East Germantown man has been arrested in the drive-by paintball gun shootings of five victims in the northwest section of Philadelphia earlier this month, police said Friday. \nKadene Bryant was taken into custody without incident Thursday at his home on the 6200 block of Homer Street. He has been charged with five counts each of aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and unlawful discharge of a paintball gun. \nThe victims in the five cases were all males, ranging in age from 16 to 57. They were walking, biking, or jogging in the Roxborough, Upper Roxborough, or Germantown neighborhoods when they were approached by someone in a white minivan, then shot with a paintball gun. Four of the paintball gun shootings occurred March 7; the fifth occurred March 8. \nLt. Dan Brooks of the Northwest Detective Division said Friday that police were led to Bryant by a tipster who saw an article about the shootings on Philly.com . He said the investigation remains ongoing and police are trying to determine if another person was involved in the shootings. \nPolice found the white minivan parked on Bryant's block. It has markings on it from paintball pellets, Brooks said. The van is now in police custody. Police, however, have not recovered the paintball gun that was allegedly used in the shootings. \nBryant was arraigned on his charges early Friday. Bail was set at $25,000. He faces an April 6 preliminary hearing. \nTwo victims had reported serious injuries, including the 16-year-old boy, who was walking in the area of the 6600 block of Ridge Avenue in Roxborough about 8:40 p.m. March 7 when a person in a white minivan shot him in the left leg and stomach with a paintball gun. He was treated at Roxborough Memorial Hospital. \nAnother victim, a 44-year-old man who was riding his bike near the 6000 block of Ridge Avenue in Roxborough just after 11 p.m. March 7 reported that he was approached by a male in a white minivan and then was shot with a paintball gun in his left eye area. This victim requiring hospitalization and six stitches. \nAnyone with information on these paintball shootings is asked to contact the Northwest Detective Division at 215-686-3353 or -3354 or call 911.
