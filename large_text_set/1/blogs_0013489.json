One more sleep away.”\nCoach Alain Vigneault had Zibanejad on a line with Rick Nash and Pavel Buchnevich for Monday’s practice — three players who have all missed large swaths of time because of injuries over the first three months of the season. \nVigneault said it was still an experiment where they all would fit, and Nash and Buchnevich would bounce from right to left wing depending on the opposing defense. \nYet the team hopes Zibanejad can regain the form he was in just before he was hurt. The 23-year-old Swede scored once in each of his final two games before being sidelined, compiling six points in the six games before he was hurt in overtime at the Garden against the Panthers.\n“Prior to his injury, he was playing real well. He was back on top of his game,” Vigneault said. “That player that I saw at the end, I’m hoping I’m going to see sooner than later.But again, I understand that it’s going to take him a little bit of time, and I’m hoping that amount of time is going to be short.”\nAlternate captain Marc Staal skated before the team Monday morning, his fourth straight day on the ice. It is very encouraging news as he tries to return from post-concussion symptoms that have kept him out since Jan. 3.\n“Coming along and going through the protocol,” Vigneault said. “So far it’s been good.”\nIt was the same scenario for forward Matt Puempel, who has been out since Dec. 31 with his second concussion this season. Vigneault said if nothing changes, Puempel should be able to practice Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T07:01:50.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
