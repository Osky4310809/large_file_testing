I'm respectful that they're top Champions League players and win trophies but I'm confident in my own teammates. So no. not really.'' \nThat respect goes as far as admiration in terms of the way German football authorities have restructured football in their country to become the world's best. \n\"Probably the golden question, isn't it?'' Cahill said about England bridging the gap. \"I think the young players to develop have to play as much football as they can at club level and play in massive, important games. Play cup finals or win in leagues. That will happen. \n\"You see the players and the clubs they are at the minute and the more experiences they go through good and bad, will bring them on as players and characters. England captain Gary Cahill says he has no fear of facing defending World Cup champions Germany. \n\"One thing for me is having ability and the other half is having the experience and being the man. That happens over time. We talked in the last tournament about how young the squad was and that happens over time.'' \nAnd while it has been a chastening 12 months since England last played Germany, Cahill feels the Three Lions are in a better place now than when they went Berlin. \nOn a personal level, the 31-year-old also feels like he is improving at Chelsea -- something Southgate has noticed in the defender's game under the tutelage of Antonio Conte. \n\"When we've played German teams, they just have that belief in the way they play,'' the England boss said. \"I'm watching Gary on the ball now and he's got that belief and confidence from the way he has been asked to play this year. \n\"You are working in a different system and opening your mind, Gary working with Antonio reminds me of what Terry [Venables] gave me as a player, just stretching you into different challenges and doing things that improve you. \n\"We won't get there overnight but I think we've got players who are able to do that.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:33:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
