The town is on the upper reaches of the Danube , close to its source in southwestern Germany.

People should have respect for nature.\" \nHe added that it was not unusual for animals to break through the frozen surface of the river in winter. He says he's seen a frozen deer and wild boar before. \nElsewhere a 43 year old woman was killed in front of her children when she was crushed by a tree which had been uprooted by heavy winds near Nice in Southern France.
