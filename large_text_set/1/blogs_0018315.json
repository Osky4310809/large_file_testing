What is fake news? \nThe deliberate making up of news stories to fool or entertain is nothing new. But the arrival of social media has meant real and fictional stories are now presented in such a similar way that it can sometimes be difficult to tell the two apart. \nThere are hundreds of fake news websites out there, from those which deliberately imitate real life newspapers, to government propaganda sites, and even those which tread the line between satire and plain misinformation, sometimes employed to suit political ends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T07:53:37.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
