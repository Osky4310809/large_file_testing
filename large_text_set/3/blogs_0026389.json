The late rock star and his wife, supermodel Iman, lived in this New York City condo from 1992 to 2002, and now it's back on the market. \nThe property includes quite the piece of memorabilia—a Yamaha piano originally owned by Bowie. The instrument has been passed from homeowner to homeowner since Bowie and Iman sold the place. \nThe 1,877 square foot apartment has three bedrooms, two full and one half bathrooms. There's a limestone entry foyer and on the other side of a pass through kitchen, a 28 foot long living room—where the piano currently sits—that overlooks Central Park. The bedroom off the living room, also with \"clear and direct\" views of the park, is currently set up as a \"stately walnut paneled\" home office, \"the perfect place from which to close the next big deal, write the next best-selling novel,\" according to the listing . \nThe master bedroom suite has five closets, a separate dressing room, and an \"extra large bath with separate deep soaking tub, rain shower and heated floors.\" The second bedroom is also master-sized with an en-suite marble, limestone, and porcelain bathroom. \nThe property is in Essex House, a building that offers \"the perfect blend of residential living and hotel living with every amenity at your fingertips from maid's service to room service.\" \nWe imagine the only touch of Bowie left in this place is the piano. With his love of Memphis Design , we bet the place looked a lot more interesting when he and Iman lived here. At the time of his death, the couple lived in the SoHo loft (converted from two separate penthouse apartments) they bought in 1999 for $4 million .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T15:08:27.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
