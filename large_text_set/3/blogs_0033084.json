Two years ago, he came out as a transgender man , both to his parents and his social media followers. Since then, he has been documenting his transition on Instagram, leading to a recent set of his before-and-after photos going viral. Why? It was actually his mention to prove there aren't any specific perimeters to follow when transitioning — that there isn't a one-size-fits-all representation. Wilson's honest, open Instagram posts let his 133,000 followers see that not all transgender stories are exactly the same. Although the 21-year-old Floridian knew he was male from a young age, he presented traditionally feminine growing up. Coming from a conservative, religious family, he never knew there was a way to describe how he was feeling. \"At first I was scared to come out as transgender because I didn't give any 'signs' as people say,\" he wrote in a recent Instagram post. \"I looked and presented very feminine...not because I wanted to but because I felt pressured to make the people around me happy.\" You May Also Like Lifestyle Guy Trolls Facebook With Series of Fake \"Engagement Photos\" On top of his appearance itself, Wilson worried about how his parents would react to his gender identity. As a teen, he came out to his mom as a lesbian, but she was more concerned about the way he dressed. \"My mom actually said to me 'I don't care if you like girls but why do you have to dress like a man?'\" Wilson told Cosmopolitan.com . \"It really wasn't about my sexual orientation... rather the way I wanted to present myself.\" Loading View on Instagram It wasn't until February 2015 when Wilson cut his hair that his desired appearance started coming to fruition. He told Cosmopolitan.com about the reactions he received. \"Everyone in my town knew me as this beautiful country girl,\" he explained. \"When I started transitioning, people couldn't believe it... they thought I was having a mental breakdown or something. People thought I was a freak.\" Loading View on Instagram Two months after cutting his hair, Wilson started looking into hormone replacement therapy and potential doctors who would provide him with it. He got his first injection of testosterone a month later at the Howard Brown Health Center in Chicago, documenting the moment on social media. Since then, he's posted pictures to show the progress he's made, inspired by other transgender people who have documented their journeys on social media. \"[The images] gave me hope that I could physically change my features, and [an understanding of] how much testosterone can change someone,\" Wilson said. He also wants to foster an understanding that people don't need to look any specific way to prove their identity. \"I want people to see it doesn't matter what some LOOKS like,\" he wrote in a recent Instagram post . \"If someone has the guts to tell you 'I'm transgender''I'm gay''I'm bisexual,' anything like that PLEASE BELIEVE them and be there for them because stereotypes need to be broken.\" Loading View on Instagram When acknowledging that everyone's transition is different, it's also essential to avoid conflating \"passing\" — being read as cisgender by people around you and society at large — to success, as it implies that not passing is somehow a form of failure. \"You don't have to pass a test to prove you're trans...and you sure as hell don't need ANYONE'S approval but your own,\" Wilson explains . And it's equally important to keep in mind that not every transgender and gender nonconforming person wants or is able to medically transition — and that decision deserves respect, whether it is related to their personal safety, financial constraints, health concerns, or any other reason.

What matters in this instance is that Wilson, as an autonomous individual, is pleased with himself and receives respect as a human being — no matter his gender identity or presentation. As Wilson himself said in the caption of his original viral Instagram pic: \"...you are NOT who people think you are...you are who you KNOW you are.\" And that is 100 percent personal.
