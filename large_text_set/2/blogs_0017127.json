Alhough he has operated a sister restaurant in Manhattan for 12 years, this is his first full year with Pinto in Brooklyn. \n“It’s the one year anniversary already, so I think it’s a good time to introduce myself to the neighborhood,” he said. \nBrooklyn Heights restaurant Pinto will serve this pomelo-and-pomegranate salad as part of Dine in Brooklyn this year. (DNAinfo/Rachel Holliday Smith) \nOther restaurants are repeat participants, such as Therapy Wine Bar in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where owner Angela Terry is offering a dinner special and has done Dine in Brooklyn for multiple years “to show our love for Brooklyn,” she said while standing next to a table full of her “chocolate trilogy\" desserts. \nShawn Hunter of Miti Miti, a Mexican spot in Park Slope, has been a part of Dine in Brooklyn for years and said it’s worked for his restaurant “tremendously.” \n“It unites the community, gets people out, maybe gets folks that don’t normally dine to come out and explore the neighborhood,\" he said as he dished out shredded chicken tacos inside Borough Hall’s rotunda. \"For $28, you can’t beat it.\" \nDine in Brooklyn will run from March 20 through March 30.
