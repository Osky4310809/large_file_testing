White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has called the show “mean,” and President Trump himself has often referred to SNL as “totally biased” and “not funny.” \nSNL largely stuck to the same script last night, featuring one sketch with Alec Baldwin mocking President Trump's leadership skills and another blasting his daughter, Ivanka . But the show also tore into liberals in a skit about scientists that have figured out a way to communicate to a lovable bulldog named Max. \n\"I like Trump. He's my man,\" Max tells the shocked scientists, including his owner Helen (portrayed by host Scarlett Johansson) , who thinks there must be a glitch. \n“There’s no glitch. Donald Trump is our president,” Max says. “He carried the Electoral College fair and square.” \nAs her team of horrified scientists try to fix the problem, Johannson scolds Max, telling him he’s just a dumb dog that doesn’t know anything. \n“Excuse me, Helen, but yes I do,” Max shoots back. “It’s that condescending attitude that made people want to vote for Trump in the first place.” \n“You just assume that because I’m a Trump supporter that I’m a xenophobic racist,” Max says, pointing out that Johannson hasn’t invited a single black person into their apartment. \nJohansson mentions that Max’s best friend is a Chihuahua, and reminds the dog that Trump wants to deport Mexicans. \n“If Aquino was born here, he has nothing to worry about,” Max says. “This is a nation of laws.” \nUpset and angered by Max’s opinion of Trump, cast member Cecily Strong, who played an executive in charge of the project, bluntly tells Johansson’s scientist, “You’re dog is a monster.” \nWatch: \n\" SNL \" has done a number of sketches this season that have hit the left. In one, the host of “Black Jeopardy” is surprised that a white Trump support has a lot in common with the other black contestants . In another, we see liberals in denial over Trump’s election wanting to move into a “bubble” protecting their progressive ideas from other forms of thinking. \nChappelle , where we see white New York liberals melt down during election night as it becomes clear Trump is going to win.
