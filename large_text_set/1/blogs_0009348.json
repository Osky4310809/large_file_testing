The stated fundraising goal for this effort was $10,000. As of this writing, the initiative had secured pledged donations of close to $145,000 from nearly 5,000 people. \n“We are so extremely grateful for the support and generosity from everyone. We cannot put into words how touching and encouraging it is to Austin and our family to see what great hearts so many people have,” reads a statement purportedly from the family of the torture victim on the fundraising page. \nQuite a few people who pledged financial help to the Hilbourn family also left messages of love and encouragement. Among them: \n“Austin, The world may have some real bad people, but there are some good ones too. Please remember that God loves you and he sees you as his child. You will rise above this. I will pray you find peace and happiness in your soul.” ~John D.
