Van Redin/Broad Green Pictures \nDirector Terrence Malick ’s long-awaited film, Song to Song , fittingly debuted last week at SXSW . The movie serves as an ode to Austin, where the city is heavily featured, which means viewers will recognize a lot of the familiar locations. \nThe film’s all-star cast, actors Ryan Gosling, Michael Fassbender, Natalie Portman, Rooney Mara, Cate Blanchett, Bérénice Marlohe, and others ran around Austin, partaking in music (many scenes took place during the city’s main music festivals: ACL, the defunct Fun Fun Fun Fest, and even SXSW), food, and general city street scenes. \n\"This was my first time in Austin, and I really loved it,\" said Fassbender in the film's production notes, \"great city, great food, great music.\" A rep noted that he enjoyed playing pool at Mean Eyed Cat, and the entire cast hung out at the Continental Club. For food, they frequented Torchy’s Tacos, Elizabeth Street Cafe, Perla’s (which is featured in the film), Lamberts, and went out to Uchi because of its vegetarian and vegan menus. \nWith that, Eater mapped out the film’s 21 restaurant, bar, and cafe locations throughout Austin, including Asti , the original Lustre Pearl , Cenote , Second Bar and Kitchen , and many others. The film serves as a quick snapshot of the changing face of Austin, with a few shutters, revamps, and relocations. \nSee a restaurant missing below that served as a location? Let Eater know through the tipline , comments, or over on the forum . 1 The Mohawk \nRooney Mara’s character, Faye, takes in a show from Mohawk’s patio deck, with drink in hand. Later on Mara plays a set with band Neon Indian.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T00:22:40.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
