Health & Fitness Why London's new fitness studios are doubling as work spaces \nWith changing docks and break-out zones, the capital's coolest workout spots mean it's easy to keep fit on the job, says Phoebe Luckhurst Monday 20 March 2017 12:06 GMT Click to followES Lifestyle Boom Cycle's new work area Daniel Hambury/Stella Pictures \nIn London, every hour is accounted for. Schedules have scant wiggle room: you have choreographed your day with forensic pendantry, right down to the time it will take you to descend the escalator, shoot four stops north on the Northern line, and then ascend the second escalator and meet whomever you cannot be late for. \nAccordingly, this makes spontaneity difficult, and balance harder. For example, in order to work and exercise, you must leave the office at precisely 6.14pm, in order to make your HIIT class, or gazump the hordes who also want to pace the same treadmill as you do this evening. Furthermore, all this zipping around the city is so exhausting that you barely have the energy to exercise anyway. \nWhat every Londoner needs is a one-stop shop: somewhere that multitasks deftly, offering both workspace and studios (as well as food). Moreover, ideally it will also be somewhere you can wait to receive guests, if you are also trying to balance an equation that includes some socialising. If it all sounds slightly institutionalised, suspend judgement till you consider the boutique options that are offering just this mixture. \nThe first is Boom Cycle, which is expanding into its third site in the Battersea Power Station development this summer — offering two spin studios, a large juice café and, crucially, “charge points everywhere”, explains its co-founder, Hilary Rowland, who tells me her plan is for visitors to use the space as an pseudo-office before and after classes. She was inspired by her crew at the Holborn studio, most of whom are part-time instructors, but use the space as a full-time office. “Half our team is in there all day,” she laughs. Self-defence for women: Five Krav Maga moves everyone should know Boom Cycle founder Hilary Gilbert on London's spinning obsession \nThey begin building the site in a few weeks: the finished iteration will be 4,700 sq ft and include 70 bikes across two studios. So the site can accommodate plenty of multitasking worker bees, and the workspace vibes will likely make a convincing difference to those people who wrestle with the guilt of leaving the office (or home office) early in order to make a class. The answer is, clearly, just bed in for the whole day — hell, maybe this way you can manage two sessions (energy permitting). \nIts location within the Battersea Power Station development is fortuitous: Rowland explains that Boom also plans to arrange drink and food deals with other brands in the area, which is certainly another incentive to reshape your day so it takes place within the orbit of the studio. Virgin Active Mayfair \nThere’s more: if you forget your kit, Rowland also promises an extensive outfitters offering with activewear for both men and women, and if you want to charge your mind as well as recharge your laptop, she also says that Boom will be holding “lifestyle talks and events” in the space. “And parties.” So it caters for the evening too, then: a real one-stop shop. 20 male fitness influencers to follow on Instagram - in pictures 20 male fitness influencers to follow on Instagram - in pictures 1/20 Joe Wicks (@thebodycoach) \n“Body Coach” Joe Wicks is on a mission to educate his 1.7 million followers on ways to be healthy, strong, and #LeanIn15.

Mike Marchese \nSeemingly, it’s setting the tone for a new movement. Third Space’s cavernous gym in Canary Wharf has an on-site restaurant-slash-lounge, the Pearson Room, which is sort of like having a members’ club lounge inside a members’-only gym. There are plump sofas and low tables, which is comfier than your real desk. Lithe sportsmen and women sit in various states of athleisure, stroking the illuminated keys of MacBook Airs; half an hour later, find them flexing across the climbing wall, collecting a team for a game in the capacious sports hall, or beating their fists to pulp on the plump punch-bags. The new fitness class where you can burn 1,000 calories in one session \nVirgin Active’s newest club on the Strand has a huge lounge, free wi-fi, Apple computers, charge points and papers — and many of its other clubs, including the Kensington gym, have smaller versions of the same set-up. Emails are more manageable after plunging into the glassy depths of a pool for a cool down. Elite gym Equinox has wi-fi everywhere, and generous tables in its café for stretching out to work. Studiedly sparse Hackney studio Blok doesn’t go in for decoration, but it does have high workspaces and a long table in its on-site café (which will also serve you bone broth for restoring brain cells after a depleting session). Many freelancing east Londoners prefer it to the showy hubbub of Shoreditch House or a cold press coffee joint. To keep fit you need to work at it.
