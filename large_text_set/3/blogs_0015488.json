(Image via Getty) \nMike Pence, a prolapsed anus in a hairpiece, has made no secret of his hatred of women. He gutted funding for Planned Parenthood in his home state of Indiana, signed a law banning abortions for fetuses found to have disabilities, and actually enabled an HIV outbreak thanks to his distaste for testing centers. Naturally, he’s being honored with a “Working for Women” award by the “Independent Women’s Forum,” a conservative non-profit for which Kellyanne Conway is a board member. Ah, it all makes sense now.

This is like giving Idi Amin a Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian efforts. Advertisement \nSome of IWF’s other unappetizing opinions include the line that the pay gap exists because women just want more flexibility and fewer working hours, with the group’s Vice President Carrie Lukas penning a 2007 op-ed in the Dallas Morning News arguing that “many women may not want to follow the path toward higher pay–which often requires more time on the road, more hours in the office or less comfortable and less interesting work–but they’re better off not feeling like victims.” Hooo boy, okay. \nThe festivities will be held on Wednesday at the Capitol Hill Club in D.C., and it promises to be a great time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T02:25:26.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
