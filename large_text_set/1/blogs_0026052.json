He could do all that and wanted to get better.\" \nIn regards to Rashford, who has now represented England six times and is likely to feature in the starting XI against Wigan, Joyce believes the youngsterâ€™s hard work has paid dividends. \n\"Aged 11 you thought he was going to be a player just by the way he glided across the ground,\" Joyce continued. \n\"A lot of work went into him in the academy. There were lads in the reserves who probably weren't as good as him but we wanted him to get that feeling of scoring goals and practising his runs.\" \nLingard, meanwhile, had to train that little bit more than other players due to a lack of physical power, claims Joyce, but his attitude has helped him make the grade at professional level. \n\"He's had to keep grinding and working away,\" he said. \"I've spent hours on the motorway up and down the country watching him when he was out on loan and making him believe. \n\"Everybody thought he was a good player but Jesse was always behind everybody because he was smaller and weaker than the others. \n\"His attitude was fantastic. He kept working and I'm glad to see he is getting his rewards.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T13:06:31.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
