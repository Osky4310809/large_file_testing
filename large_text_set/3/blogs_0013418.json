Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThe Great British Bake Off lineup has been confirmed - and, with Noel Fielding taking over hosting duties, it's extremely unexpected! \nAs previously reported, food writer Prue Leith will be replacing Mary Berry and joining Paul Hollywood as judge when it debuts on Channel 4 later this year. \nAlongside the judges will be presenter, comedian and writer Sandi Toksvig OBE and comedian and actor Noel taking over the reins from Mel and Sue as well as the all-important twelve amateur bakers for the eighth series of the multi-award-winning show. \nSpeaking about his new job, The Mighty Boosh star Noel said: “GBBO is one of my favourite shows. I’ve always loved brightly coloured cakes and Sandi Toksvig so this is a dream come true for me! \n\"It’s basically the double.\" \nQI host Sandi added: “It is an extraordinary honour to part of this national treasure of a show. \n\"Noel Fielding is one of the nicest guys in show business. The first time I met him I felt like I had met a rather wayward cousin whose take on the world made me laugh. \n\"The only down side is that he has much better dress sense that I do. I spend my daytimes on Channel 4 already so it will be a treat to be there in the evenings. \n\"I am so delighted to be working with Love Productions and Channel 4 on this best of British show.” \nPaul said: “I could not be more delighted by who will be joining me on the show. Prue is a hugely respected culinary legend and Sandi and Noel are warm and utterly hilarious. I cannot wait to get back in the tent with the bakers.” \nAn excited Prue added: “I am just so thrilled to be joining Paul, Sandi and Noel on the biggest show on TV and I cannot wait to see what the real stars of the show – the bakers – are going to create for us. It is such an honour to be part of The Great British Bake Off team. “ \nChannel 4 Chief Creative Officer Jay Hunt said: “The Great British Bake Off will have a uniquely Channel 4 take when it airs this autumn. Paul and Prue have huge amounts of expertise and warmth. \n\"I’m looking forward to seeing them putting our great new bunch of amateur bakers through their paces. Sandi and Noel bring a fresh wit and quirkiness to the tent. It’s just the sort of innovative lineup audiences expect from Channel 4.” \nCreator and Executive Producer for Love Productions Richard McKerrow said “We are honoured to have the esteemed Prue Leith join Paul as judge on GBBO and know that Sandi and Noel will bring plenty of fun and warmth to the tent. We cannot wait for them to meet our new batch of bakers.
