Van Aanholt plays the ball to the edge of the box and Rodwell fires on the turn, forcing a fine save out of Mignolet who gets down well to make the stop. Defoe was lurking but the Belgian pushed it away to safety. 11' A nonchalant effort from Wijnaldum to collect the ball sees Sunderland win a goal-kick to clear their lines. The ball had clearly hit off the Dutchman, but he didn't seem too bothered about retaining possession. 10' Firmino gets the better of Love of the flank, but the defender recovers to make a strong clearing tackle to alleviate the pressure. 8' SAVES! Mannone keeps the score level with two fine saves. First to deny Sturridge as the striker peeled off his man and fired at goal, only to be denied by a strong hand from the Italian. Liverpool recycled possession and Wijnaldum powered an effort towards the top corner, only to be denied by a smart stop. 7' OFFSIDE! Larsson whips the ball into the box and Rodwell finds space to head at goal, but he can only direct his header wide of the post. Fortunately for the Sunderland man he was offside anyway so his effort would not have counted. 7' Januzaj gets caught by Can and the referee awards a free-kick even though the Belgian finds Love on the right flank. 6' CHANCE! Larsson does well on the left to release Van Aanholt and he in turn finds Defoe 25 yards from goal. The striker powers an effort at goal, but Mignolet gets down well to make the stop. 4' Firmino and Mane combine down the right and the latter attempts to send a cross to the back post, but he can only guide his effort out for a goal-kick. 3' Clyne raids down the right flank and sends a low cross into the box, but it just evades the black shirts and Borini gets back to help his defence to clear the danger. 2' Liverpool are into their stride in the early stages of this contest, knocking the ball around the pitch with absolute ease. 1' We're underway at the Stadium of Light. The players are making their way out on to the pitch, so we should be underway shortly. STAT ATTACK! Sunderland are without a win in their last three home matches against the Reds. The Black Cats' last win over Liverpool came in March 2012 when Nicklas Bendtner scored the only goal of the game. Liverpool are without injured skipper Jordan Henderson, with Klopp making just one change from his side's win over City as Sturridge replaces the midfielder. Adam Lallana drops out of his advanced role to join Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum in the central area. David Moyes has been forced into three changes this afternoon with Donald Love, Didier Ndong and Jack Rodwell coming into the fold, with the latter making his return from a recent injury lay-off. Sunderland are down to the bare bones of their squad following injuries to Lamine Kone and Victor Anichebe against Burnley, with the duo joining Jordan Pickford, Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole, Duncan Watmore, Paddy McNair and Lynden Gooch on the sidelines. Liverpool subs: Lucas, Moreno, Karius, Origi, Stewart, Ejaria, Arnold. LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Mignolet; Clyne, Lovren, Klavan, Milner; Can, Wijnaldum, Lallana; Mane, Firmino, Sturridge. Sunderland subs: Khazri, Mika, Manquillo, Honeyman, Maja, Embleton, Ledger. SUNDERLAND (4-3-3): Mannone; Love, O'Shea, Djilobodji, Van Aanholt; Ndong, Rodwell, Larsson; Borini, Januzaj, Defoe. The team news has been announced and we'll start with the home side. Liverpool are on the charge at the top of the table, having reeled off their fourth win on the spin in their triumph over Manchester City on New Year's Eve. Jurgen Klopp's men are still six points off the pace of leaders Chelsea and will be determined to close the gap, despite injury worries of their own. Sunderland have found themselves back in a heap of trouble after back-to-back defeats over the Festive period. The Black Cats lost to Manchester United and then were hammered at Burnley on Saturday to leave themselves four points adrift and with a host of injury problems. Good afternoon and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Sunderland and Liverpool at the Stadium of Light.
