The venue had already sold about 1,000 tickets for the show, and the promoter tried to convince the Snowman to keep his commitment. The suit continues by saying Jeezy’s promised payment was even upped to $80,000 per the rapper’s request. \n“[A]t the last minute,” Jeezy decided to attend a party in his hometown the same date as the scheduled show. Austin says he offered to reschedule the concert or even fly Jeezy in a private jet to Houston to do the performance, but Jeezy didn’t take up either offer.
