The P10 Plus might be what you need 14 February 2017 / 12:56SGT \nHuawei's looking to make a big splash at the Mobile World Congress, with not just the V9 but likely the P10, P10 Plus as well as a new watch. Huawei gunning for spotlight \nSo far, one listing has come out on a Spanish website: retailer Phone House, that shows some pretty interesting specs for the P10 Plus. The P10 Plus is listed as having a 5.5in display with Quad HD resolution, a Kirin 960 processor, 12MP rear camera, 3.5mm headphone jack, 256GB internal storage. \nBut most interesting is the 8GB of RAM - that's more than some people have on their laptops. The listing also says the device will cost â‚¬799 (S$1200), with colour choices of black, white and gold. \nWe're guessing the Huawei P10 will come with a smaller form factor and similar internals, though perhaps a little less RAM. Besides the P10, P10 Plus and V9, Huawei will also be featuring its latest smartwatch. \nHuawei's CEO Richard Yu posted a teaser of what's to come in Huawei's smartwatch plans on his Weibo, formally outing the name of the new watch as Huawei Watch 2. You can't see the watch clearly in the photo but it's obvious we'll have a new Huawei smartwatch to look forward to. \nExciting stuff indeed.
