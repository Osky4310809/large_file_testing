Last year was the warmest year on record, surpassing previous milestones set in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nZeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the nonprofit organization Berkeley Earth, said Rose's story is \"so wrong, it's hard to know where to start.\"\nThis article is so wrong its hard to know where to start https://t.co/i015AysbUe .

President Donald Trump, for example, has claimed global warming is a \"hoax,\" and he has named well-known climate deniers to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy, among other posts.\nAt the heart of Rose's controversial story is the June 2015 study disproving the warming pause that scientists had observed from 1998 to 2012.\nThe NOAA study, published in the prestigious journal Science , found that the slowdown in global warming never actually happened. Instead, improperly adjusted data on surface temperatures made for an artificial lull in the warming trend.\nWhen NOAA researchers corrected their temperature datasets, they found that Earth's climate had warmed by a larger amount than previously thought.\nNOAA figures released in June 2015 show the temperature trend from revised surface data.\nImage: NOAA/NCEI\nPeople who reject mainstream climate science are suspicious of this study. For skeptics, the so-called pause was proof that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels have less of an influence on global temperatures than most studies have shown.\nShortly after its release, Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, launched a dogged campaign to determine whether NOAA scientists had manipulated data for political purposes.\nThe Texas Republican took the unprecedented step of issuing a subpoena for the NOAA administrator, marking the first time his House committee — mainly an oversight body — had taken such a legal step.\nKathryn Sullivan, then the NOAA administrator, refused to comply with the subpoena, although she did make NOAA scientists, including the lead author of the 2015 study, available to speak with committee members on multiple occasions.\nThe investigation turned up next to nothing. For Smith, however, the Daily Mail story seemed to only confirm his long-lingering suspicions.\nNOAA sr officials played fast & loose w/data in order 2 meet politically predetermined conclusion on climate change https://t.co/4vTeyFuQFt\n— Lamar Smith (@LamarSmithTX21) February 5, 2017\nNOAA scientists aren't the only group to dispel the notion of a global warming pause. Nor is NOAA the only agency whose data shows that the pause may not have happened, and that warming has sped up in recent years.\nIn January, an independent group of U.S. and British scientists concluded that NOAA's temperature adjustments were accurate.\nBerkeley Earth scientist Hausfather led the study with colleagues from NASA, the U.K.'s York University, George Mason University in Virginia, plus one other independent researcher.\nTheir 2017 paper in Science Advances compared the old NOAA temperature record and the new NOAA record to datasets collected from buoys, satellite radiometers and Argo floats that measure temperature and salinity in the oceans.\nNew NOAA (ERSST v4), old NOAA (ERSST v3) and UK Hadley Center (HADSST3) data differ in recent years.\nImage: HAUSFATHER ET AL. 2016\nOn Sunday, in response to Rose's article, Hausfather wrote , \"The fact that the new NOAA record is effectively identical with records constructed only from higher quality instruments...strongly suggests that NOAA got it right.\"\nVictor Venema, a German scientist with the World Meteorological Organization, explained in his own blog post how Rose apparently misconstrued the climate data to support evidence of a pause.\nIrish climate scientist Peter Thorne, who worked on the landmark 2015 study , also penned a rebuttal to the newspaper article, noting that at least seven key aspects of the story are a \"misrepresentation of the processes that actually occurred.\"\nHe added that the accusations \"do not square one iota with the robust integrity I see in the work and discussions that I have been involved in with them [NOAA] for over a decade.\"\nBONUS: 2016 was Earth's warmest year on record, continuing a three-year streak", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/N0qMIbiHkCTzyi216KLCiXpgvlo=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F372678%2Fde29430e-256c-4a3d-8b3d-9f901da73729.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/EDnPnbE2.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tD8dRYDhFBEU2Srjtp9L9-SFx3M=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F372676%2F41add3a4-cfe4-46f8-b364-3c5bf8bc92a1.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HRlnNMmLuGC8ysX1JP28Vw7eDZE=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F372678%2Fde29430e-256c-4a3d-8b3d-9f901da73729.jpg", "https://t.co/i015AysbUe", "https://t.co/yz4nlkvFah", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/05/whistle-blower-global-warming-data-manipulated-paris-conference/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4192182/World-leaders-duped-manipulated-global-warming-data.html", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/dec/08/david-rose-climate-science", "https://twitter.com/DavidRoseUK", "http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/06/03/science.aaa5632.full", "http://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/stunning-new-data-indicates-el-nino-drove-record-highs-global-temperatures-david-rose-daily-mail/", "https://twitter.com/hausfath/status/828027310821347328", "https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-mail-sundays-astonishing-evidence-global-temperature-rise", "https://twitter.com/ClimateOfGavin/status/828082851585388544", "http://variable-variability.blogspot.com.au/2017/02/david-roses-alternative-reality-noaa-Karl.html", "http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/05/noaa-scientists-manipulated-temperature-data-to-make-global-warming-seem-worse/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/EDnPnbE2.m3u8", "http://icarus-maynooth.blogspot.com.au/2017/02/on-mail-on-sunday-article-on-karl-et-al.html?spref=tw", "https://t.co/4vTeyFuQFt", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yBL5RjqnLzNX5mrCurfzAvguIC8=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F372676%2F41add3a4-cfe4-46f8-b364-3c5bf8bc92a1.png", "http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601207", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FailOnSunday?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/LamarSmithTX21/status/828294908997943296", "https://t.co/R5VsqqlNHr"], "published": "2017-02-06T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:48:37.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
