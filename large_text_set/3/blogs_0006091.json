She also had substantial injuries to her upper lip, two shattered teeth and two fractured ribs.\n“There’s no way I could physically overpower him,” Mack testified, adding that if she had fought back, the beating would have been 10 times worse.\nMackinday said Koppenhaver, 35, also repeatedly kicked one of her legs, leaving it badly bruised and making it hard for her to walk.\n“I was limping for probably two weeks afterwards,” she testified.\nUpon cross-examination, Mackinday testified that she has since had cosmetic surgeries to repair damage to her lips, as well as other surgeries to her nose and teeth.\nImages of Mackinday after the alleged attack Twitter Mackinday said she first met Koppenhaver at a photo shoot for Hustler magazine in 2013 and began dating him weeks later. She testified that they broke up in May 2014, but that he still had a key to her apartment.\nShe first took the stand on Wednesday , saying the fights between the two often escalated to Koppenhaver choking her into unconsciousness.\n“At first they weren’t that frequent — maybe once a month — but as our relationship progressed, the violence progressed,” Mack testified Wednesday.\nMackinday said she was afraid to report the abuse to authorities because Koppenhaver threatened to “send his Navy SEAL friends or Hell’s Angels” after her and her relatives.\nProsecutors on Monday began their case against Koppenhaver, who faces a litany of charges, including attempted murder, kidnapping and sexual assault. The charges stem from alleged ongoing abuse that prosecutors say ended in an attack on Mackinday and Thomas, who testified earlier in the trial that he told Koppenhaver during the attack: “You gotta kill me, or you gotta let me go.”\nBefore escaping to get help, Mackinday testified that Koppenhaver told her: “Now I have to kill you. I’ve gone too far.”\nRoughly an hour before the attack, Koppenhaver and Mackinday had exchanged “I love you” text messages, according to Koppenhaver’s defense attorney, Jay Leiderman.\n“And then it all breaks loose,” Leiderman told jurors.\nKoppenhaver has pleaded not guilty and faces up to life in prison if convicted. He was known as a fan favorite during his MMA fighting career, popular for a reckless style that often sacrificed his body in hopes for a spectacular knockout. He amassed a 14-5 record as a welterweight after debuting in the Ultimate Fighting Championship in 2007. His last fight was in 2013.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:26:15.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
