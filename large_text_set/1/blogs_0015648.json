Today the company announced that it is bringing the device to the Indian market as well. The C9 Pro will go on sale in the second half of February, but you’ll be able to pre-order it starting January 27 for Rs. 36,900. To sweeten the deal, Samsung is offering a one-time screen replacement to those who pre-order the smartphone, which is valid for one year from the date of purchase. You’ll be able to get the device in either black or gold.\nThe Galaxy C9 Pro is a big phone, as it sports a 6-inch Super AMOLED screen with a Full HD resolution. It is the first smartphone from Samsung that has 6 GB of RAM. The device is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 653 chipset and comes equipped with two 16 MP cameras — front and rear — with an f/1.9 aperture.\nSee also: Galaxy C7 Pro with 5.7-inch screen, 4 GB of RAM, and SD 626 finally announced 1 day ago There is 64 GB of storage available for video, photos, and other content. In case that’s not enough, you can expand it for an additional 256 GB with the help of a microSD card. The device features a metal body that houses a large 4,000 mAh battery, which supports fast charging. Additionally, the phablet also comes with stereo speakers as well as a fingerprint scanner that always comes in handy. It ships with Android Marshmallow on board with Samsung’s custom UI on top.\nIf you’re in the market for a large phone, the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro just might be up your alley. But if you prefer a slightly smaller device, you might want to consider getting the recently released Lenovo P2 , or even the Lenovo Z2 Plus , which got a price cut yesterday. The choice is yours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-17T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T15:52:47.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
