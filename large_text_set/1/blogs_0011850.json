LOUIS (KMOX) – UPDATE 12:16 a.m. — St. Louis police say Kamiell Taylor has been found safe. She’s been taken to a hospital for analysis and treatment. \nSLMPD planned a news conference early Saturday morning to explain further: Lt. Perri Johnson provides update to media about locating 12-year old Kameill Taylor. https://t.co/PRrGVeTMbS \n— St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) January 14, 2017 \nLt. Perri Johnson says officers located the 12-year-old in the upstairs of a vacant building at 5327 Terry about 10:30 p.m. Friday. \n“She suffered some trauma,” Johnson says. “To the extent — we’re not sure.” \nKamiell was conscious and alone when she was found. \nJohnson says it is obvious she did not get into the building voluntarily, and they believe she was in there for most of the time she was missing. \nThe investigation is ongoing. \nEarlier Story: \nSt. Louis police are getting increasingly worried about the safety of a 12-year-old girl who’s been missing since early Wednesday. \nMISSING: 12-Year-Old Last Seen On Way To Bus Stop Wednesday \nLt. Perri Johnson says it’s very concerning Kameill Taylor hasn’t been found yet, but her disappearance doesn’t yet rise to an AMBER Alert level. \n“We’re not ruling out that she was forcibly taken, but we don’t know that for sure,” Johnson says. “We don’t know that she is in danger. I hope that she isn’t — we’re not ruling it out, but for right now, it doesn’t fit the criteria of an AMBER alert.” Lt. Johnson briefing media on search for missing, 12-year old Kameill Taylor. https://t.co/9Dg6Nh7sfP \nKameill was last seen about 6 a.m. Wednesday as she left home to go to her bus stop about 3 or 4 blocks away. \nShe never made it there or to school. \nKameill is about 5′ 7″ and 160 pounds, last seen wearing black and purple Nike Air Jordans, black plants and a black polo-type shirt. She was carrying a bright-colored plaid book bag. \nAnyone who sees Kameill or has any information on her whereabouts is asked to call 911. \n(TM and Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
