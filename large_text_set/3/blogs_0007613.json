The country's bill for care is rocketing (Photo: REX/Shutterstock) \nThat translates to £115million of the money promised in the Budget for social care going to shareholders and bondholders in the five biggest care providers. \nNew Economics Foundation Chief Executive Marc Stears said: “Everyone knows our social care system desperately needs cash. \n“But far too much of the £2billion the Chancellor promised will go straight into the pockets of private investors rather than to the beds and services people need. \n“The Government could put a stop to it now by making sure big care providers offer more reasonable returns to their investors. \n“That way more of the much-needed cash promised this week would go towards frontline services. \n“It’s time we built a care system that puts people, and not investors, in control.” \nMr Hammond has said the Government will publish options later this year for a long-term overhaul of social care.

Unless we take action now, millions will end up suffering at the hands of a system that values neither our dignity in old age nor our lifelong tax contributions. \n“While the extra funding for social care is desperately needed, we urgently need to do the hard work of reforming how care is delivered. \n“The Government’s review of social care must set out how we can support a network of smaller care providers, putting dignity back into the services our friends, neighbours and relatives depend on.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T02:17:58.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
