But could the Chicago Public Schools system make more cash if it goes commercial? \nCBS 2’s Lauren Victory reports from University Village. \nThis property – the former Moses Montefiore Academy — went on the market in January. \nDevelopers may be interested. So, too, is Urban Prairie Waldorf School, which has already outgrown its second home. \n“We’d been planning for a long time to have a long-term home for our school,” parent Michael Levine says. “We started out in a storefront on 16th and Halsted eight years ago.” \nAdds Heather Berhalter, Urban Prairie administrator: “We have so many preschoolers coming up. If we don’t find a new space, they’re going to be sitting in each other’s laps.” \nOne obstacle is convincing CPS to sell Moses Montefiore Academy to Urban Prairie. \nThe Ashland Avenue school has sat vacant for more than a year. CPS needed bids this past Monday, and Urban Prairie needed fast cash to show commitment and interest. \nBerhalter says the school raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in a three-day capital campaign. \n“The way that our community rallied around this, we know that even if we don’t end up getting this space, we will get a space,” parent Elisa Davis says. \n\nLauren Victory Lauren Victory is a general assignment reporter for CBS 2 Lauren came to Chicago after two years as a reporter/fill-in anchor at WTIC-TV in Hartford, Conn.
