Clara in Sta. Ana, Cagayan on Sunday. \nRevelyn Talaro, a Grade 5 student, was reported missing four days earlier, said Chief Inspector Saturnino Soriano, Sta. Ana police chief. \nSoriano said medico-legal officers could not confirm if the victim was raped because animals apparently ate her genitals. The head of the girl was bashed with a hard object. \nTwo men were invited for questioning. \nMeanwhile, laborer Stanley Amoga, 25, was arrested for allegedly raping a four-year-old girl in Barangay Ammacian in Pinukpuk, Kalinga last year. \nAmoga, who was ranked fourth on the list of most wanted persons in Kalinga, was arrested based on a warrant issued by Tabuk City Regional Trial Court Judge Marcelino Wacas Ngis-o.
