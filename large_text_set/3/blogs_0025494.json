That’s what we’ve been practicing and that’s what we know how to do, so we took what we did in practice and brought it on the field,” Lindahl said. “I was really impressed by our freshmen today and our sophomores. They did really well. They stepped up to the challenge and they’re going to make us a really solid team throughout this season and next season.” \nMarriotts added four more runs in the fourth inning with big hits from Nies, and Bernard, who hit a two-run double to bring home Nies and Hughes, which extended the cushion to 9-1. \n“I just told them that you have to just put it behind you,” said Hawks coach Marni Rosenbaum. “I think we did a decent job as far as getting some base runners on, whether via the walk, putting the ball in play and making them do things. And the game is never over until it’s over, so we’re playing one inning at a time as far as being able to come out and do that. Hopefully we can get an inning like that, but things are going to happen out there and we just have to learn from those mistakes.” \nA photo gallery preview of all 13 Howard County softball teams heading into the 2017 season. (BSMG) (Monica D'Ippolito) \nRiver Hill closed out the game strong, allowing just three hits in the last three innings. Nies though had another big hit in the top of the sixth and was about two feet away from registering her first homerun of the season, but her knock ricocheted off the right field fence and she settled for a double. \nNies was eventually brought home by Bernard later in the inning to tally the Mustangs only score of the sixth. \nNies went 4-for-5 on the day with thee runs and an RBI, while Bernard went 3-for-4 with two runs and four RBI. \n“We’re a young team to begin with so it’s our first game and we had a little bit of the first opening-season game jitters,” Peksa said. “But after the game I told them alright, we take the good from today and we celebrate it. We take what we need to work on from today and we’re going to practice it tomorrow, and we’re going to get ready for Hebron on Friday.” \nDelanie Vitz got the start for the Hawks, throwing three innings and recording one strikeout, while Quinn Kindbom closed out the game and also had one strikeout. Kenyon and Annabel McCullough, meanwhile, each finished with two hits for River Hill. \n“I think Delanie did a nice job pitching,” Rosenbaum said. “Obviously they started to kind of figure her out timing wise and then Quinn then coming in and giving them a different look of having a lefty pitcher to be able to come in from that and throws a little bit different than Delanie does.” \nThe Hawks have a young roster this season, and with the snow conditions the past week were limited in practice. Rosenbaum is anxious to get back on the field to prepare for their next game Saturday against Southern. \n“I told them if you take a way a few of those innings and obviously the errors — it’s tough practicing fly balls and doing stuff inside when we’ve been dealing with the snow and the past few days,” she said. “So obviously the biggest thing that we talked about was communication and just that focus throughout the game. Our first time with a bunch of new players and just getting in the swing of things, seeing what a varsity game is like up from JV for my two freshmen from their travel ball teams to high school, so I am OK with how the first game went. I think the nice thing is that we’ve got two days of practice before we play Southern on Saturday, so we know what we want to work on and where we need to grow from there.” \nMarriotts Ridge 11, River Hill 1 \nMR (1-0 county, 1-0 overall), RH (0-1, 0-1) \nMR — 0 0 5 4 0 1 1 11 11 2 \nRH — 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 3 \nLindahl (4), Barnard (3)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T08:07:54.587+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
