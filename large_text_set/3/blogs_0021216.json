The Washington Times reported that the recognition is the highest Army personnel can receive during a non-combat situation. The citation read, “Chaplain Christensen had only a moment to react and risked his own life to save the life of another soldier. His efforts made a difference and ultimately saved two soldiers’ lives.” \nLt. Col. Joel Newsom said he was impressed with Christensen’s judgement, adding that the chaplain was deserving of the honor.
