Studesville, a 21-year coaching veteran, will also serve as assistant head coach under head coach Vance Joseph, an NFL source confirmed. \n9News first reported Studesville’s promotion. \nStudesville joined the Broncos in 2010 after stints with the Chicago Bears (1997-2000), New York Giants (2001-03) and Buffalo Bills (2004-09) and was elevated to interim head coach when Josh McDaniels was fired later that season. \nSince 2010, the Broncos rank 13th in the league with 114.9 rushing yards per game and 21st with 4.09 average yards per carry, while Studesville has worked under four different head coaches, including the most recent hire, Joseph.

Veteran C.J. Anderson , returning from a knee injury that ended his 2016 campaign early, was selected to a Pro Bowl in 2014 under Studesville’s watch and will again pair with Devontae Booker, a 2016 fourth-round draft pick. \nBooker led the Broncos with 612 rushing yards (3.52 average) and four touchdowns on 174 carries. The team as a whole finished with 92.8 rushing yards per game (27th in NFL). \nAnother possible promotion? Broncos general manager John Elway gave his director of college scouting Adam Peters permission to interview for the San Francisco 49ers director of player personnel position. \nPeters, who is still under contract with the Broncos, just finished his eighth season with the Broncos rising from a regional scout to the Broncos’ lead scout and one of the top talent evaluators. January, February and March are the biggest months for scouts to evaluate college players leading into April’s draft. \nThe 49ers hired Broncos Ring of Fame safety John Lynch as their new general manager Sunday. The first-time general manager is expected to fill out his staff with experience and proven success. Peters would fit that description. \nWelker to Houston . The Texans hired former Broncos receiver Wes Welker as an offensive/special teams assistant. Welker played two seasons in Denver (2013-14) and totaled 1,242 receiving yards and 12 touchdowns. Welker played eight games with the Rams in 2015 and totaled 102 receiving yards.
