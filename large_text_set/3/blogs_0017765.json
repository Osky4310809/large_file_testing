These requests began in 2014, but haven’t resulted in any testimony from Manafort. \nUS authorities confirmed to CNN that the requests were received but declined further comment. \nManafort is wanted for his involvement in a case in which Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian candidate whose presidential campaign was guided by Manafort, really did “lock her up.” The her being Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Manafort’s man Yanukovych helped to frame and jail Tymoshenko in a scheme involving Russian access to Ukrainian oil and gas. \nWhen the United States became upset over the jailing of Tymoshenko and considered sanctions against Ukraine, M anafort helped draft a plan to secure help from a high-powered law firm in New York City. It’s what that firm did, and the $1 million it was paid, that is the subject of the latest in a series of requests for a few words with Manafort. Prosecutors also showed CNN documentation they sent to the DOJ in which they told the US authorities that their investigation had \"established that the well-known American political strategist Paul Manafort is implicated in the relationship between the Skadden Arps. firm and the Justice Ministry of Ukraine.\" Of Manafort, the letter said he \"was likely the person who advised representatives of the former Government of Ukraine to hire the law firm and was present during talks about this issue.\" \nRight now, Manafort isn’t facing charges in this case … but it’s far from his only legal issue. \nWhy the United States hasn't moved to make Manafort available to Ukraine under a treaty of mutual assistance is unclear. The final letter was dated September 2016: Ukraine's Prosecutor General, the equivalent of a US Attorney General, sent a letter directly to FBI director James Comey asking for clarification for why the US authorities would not help. \nThe actions in question happened before Manafort was Donald Trump’s manager, but after he had already picked up a nice apartment in Trump Tower . In fact, it’s not clear when, or even if, Manafort’s association with pro-Russian forces in Ukraine ended. Several of Manafort’s actions in Ukraine continue to be the subject of potential attention from courts. \nActions such as arranging protests that Putin used as an excuse for invasion. \nThe senior Ukrainian prosecutor alleges that in 2006 Mr. Manafort orchestrated a series of Anti-Nato, Anti-Kiev protests in Crimea led by Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian Party of Regions—now a designated criminal organisation. The protests forced planned Nato exercises there to be cancelled. \nAnd violating U.S. laws on foreign lobbying : \nDonald Trump's campaign chairman helped a pro-Russian governing party in Ukraine secretly route at least $2.2 million in payments to two prominent Washington lobbying firms in 2012, and did so in a way that effectively obscured the foreign political party's efforts to influence U.S. policy. \nAnd arranging a “riot” in which U.S. Marines were attacked: \n“We had rocks thrown at us. Rocks hit Marines. Buses were rocked back and forth. We were just trying to get to our base.” … \nAnd taking more than $12 million in off the books cash: \n… government investigators examining secret records have found his name, as well as companies he sought business with, as they try to untangle a corrupt network they say was used to loot Ukrainian assets and influence elections during the administration of Mr. Manafort’s main client, former President Viktor F. Yanukovych. \nThat last claim is already thought to be at the center of an FBI investigation into Manafort. So perhaps the answer to “why won’t you let us question Manafort about his second-hand involvement in misappropriating $1 million” is “because we’re about to indict him for a lot more than that.” Bonus Ukraine bits... \nIt appears that Manafort may have been blackmailed using knowledge of not just his under-the-table funds for helping out Russian interests in Ukraine ... \nAttached to the text is a note to Paul Manafort referring to “bulletproof” evidence related to Manafort’s financial arrangement with Ukraine’s former president, the pro-Russian strongman Viktor Yanukovych, as well as an alleged 2012 meeting between Trump and a close Yanukovych associate named Serhiy Tulub. \n...but also for arranging a meeting between Donald Trump and a pro-Russian Ukrainian official. \nThe White House did not respond to a question about whether Trump had met with Tulub, a hunting buddy of Yanukovych’s who had served as part of government when Yanukovych was prime minister. \nNone of this has stopped Manafort from seemingly trying to secure Ukraine for Putin, and he’s not the only one on the Trump team working to that end. \nThe new story explains that a group of Trump operatives, including top lawyer Michael Cohen and fired former campaign manager Paul Manafort, along with a pro-Putin Ukrainian parliamentarian named Andrii V. Artemenko and Mr. Sater are pushing President Trump on a 'peace plan' for Russia and Ukraine. \nThe Manafort–Artemenko–Cohen plan ended up on Flynn’s desk shortly before National Security Adviser Michael Flynn left office, supposedly over his conversations with the Russian ambassador and not his failing to register as a foreign agent—which Trump already knew about . And of course, Trump himself made sure that the Ukraine remained a soft target for Moscow . \nInside the meeting, Diana Denman, a platform committee member from Texas who was a Ted Cruz supporter, proposed a platform amendment that would call for maintaining or increasing sanctions against Russia, increasing aid for Ukraine and “providing lethal defensive weapons” to the Ukrainian military. … \nTrump staffers in the room, who are not delegates but are there to oversee the process, intervened. By working with pro-Trump delegates, they were able to get the issue tabled while they devised a method to roll back the language. \nOne of those Trump staffers has since been identified as J. D. Gordon : \nThe Trump campaign's national-security policy representative for the Republican National Convention, J.D. Gordon, told CNN on Thursday that he pushed to alter an amendment to the GOP's draft policy on Ukraine at the Republican National Convention last year to further align it with President Donald Trump's views. \nNote that it’s not as if Gordon was acting on his own : \nThe two Trump staffers claimed to a delegate that they had to call and talk to “Mr. Trump”—perhaps name-dropping as obnoxious staffers, or perhaps Trump really was involved at the highest level with this particular amendment. The Trump staffers told the delegate that they had discussed Ukraine policy directly with Trump. \nDonald Trump, whose level of sophistication on foreign policy comes down to shouting about “Sweden” because he misheard a story on Fox, has detailed views on the language surrounding wording of how Ukraine should be assisted against Russian forces. \nWhy would that be?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:32:50.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
