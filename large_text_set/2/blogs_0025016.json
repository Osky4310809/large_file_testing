The company officially provided details on the Exynos 9 Series 8895 chip. That’s one of two expected to deploy in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chip is also likely to be used, probably for launch in the U.S. while Exynos will be launched in other markets.\nLike the Snapdragon 835, the Exynos 9 Series 8895 chip supports Gigabit LTE networks, some of the fastest “5G” wireless networks that will begin to activate in 2017. It also has tweaks to improve virtual reality, support for playing 4K UHD video at 120fps and more.\nAlmost certainly in the Galaxy S8 Samsung didn’t say this is in the Galaxy S8, but it seems almost certain it will be. The company noted that the chip is already in mass production, which would make sense since the Galaxy S8 is probably also in mass production ahead of its expected launch on April 21. This sounds like a mighty fine processor, and one that I hope we can get our hands on to test next to the Snapdragon 835 at some point.
