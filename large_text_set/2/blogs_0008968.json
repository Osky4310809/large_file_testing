Welcome to Music’s Biggest Night™, known to those in the biz as the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Every year for the past few years , we’ve been offering by-the-minute updates on all the crazy and wacky shit that happens during the ceremony — we’re continuing the tradition this year, and we’re combining it with our esteemed comment party so y’all have a one stop shop to talk about everything that goes down throughout the night. Looking through last year’s list … we truly do not remember a single thing that happened! But what is an award show’s purpose if not for creating pointless ephemera to laugh at and then forget soon after? (Does this sound familiar ? I hope not…) \nAll night long, we’ll be collecting the funniest, weirdest, best, worst, and most memorable moments from the 2017 Grammys to live on in perpetuity. This includes GIFs, tweets, Instagrams, Vines (just kidding!), and whatever else strikes our fancy. And we encourage you to do the same in the comments! You can take a look at who wins what , and keep an eye on our front page for all of the performances throughout the night. \nLet’s get it started! what are your favorite #bars from \"Hotline Bling,\" the rap song that just won the Grammy for best rap song (for its rapping) ? \n— Joe Coscarelli (@joecoscarelli) February 12, 2017 Imagine seeking attention this hard for so long and STILL not having anyone know who you are. pic.twitter.com/w8B7HraC1F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:42:15.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
