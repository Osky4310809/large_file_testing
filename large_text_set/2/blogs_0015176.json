He had a painfully awkward exchange with a reporter after the game when asked about the first-quarter connection. \n“Oh, that was a question? … He threw a lob and that’s all that happened. He just threw a lob. It’s basketball. That’s it,” Westbrook responded to the reporter asking for further explanation of the much talked about game highlight.

Y’all have a great time, I’ll see you in the second half of the season.” \nEarlier, another journalist wanted Westbrook to divulge more about a conversation the Thunder star had with Durant in the lead-up to the All-Star game, but he wasn’t taking the bait. \n“Yeh, I told him...I’m not telling you, but you know he did a good job, he got it done,” Westbrook said. \nThe reporter tried to get him to expand on the topic: “You told him to shoot early and often?” \n“Ah no, that’s what you said,” Westbrook snapped back while laughing. \nAt halftime, Durant was asked about the alley-oop. Like Westbrook, he didn’t say much, but did compliment his former teammate’s hops. \n“He’s a great basketball player. He was open, so I threw him the lob and he can jump really high so, yeah, good play,” Durant said. \nWhile it was fun to see these two connecting once again, it’s clear they’re not going to mend this broken relationship any time soon.
