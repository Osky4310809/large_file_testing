In fact, the end of Rogue One leads perfectly into the very first Star Wars film A New Hope .\nRogue One didn’t even feature a Jedi , but that doesn’t mean the film wasn’t strongly tied into the Star Wars franchise. In fact, the end of Rogue One is the perfect segue into A New Hope, as we see Princess Leia send the Death Star plans hidden inside R2D2 to save them from Darth Vader. Those Death Star plans were recovered in A New Hope .\nRogue One then ends with Darth Vader attacking a rebel ship, which barely escapes with the plans (and Princess Leia) aboard. Of course, A New Hope then picks up as Darth Vader chases the ship. Yes, it’s a pretty seamless connection when you actually think about it.\nLucasfilm If you weren’t sure of just how well-done the tie-in between the two films was, now an editor has spliced the end of Rogue One with the beginning of A New Hope . And the result is pretty cool. It becomes pretty obvious that it was the intention of the Rogue One filmmakers all along.\nWatch the basically perfect transition spliced together here: \nPretty neat, right? It would be the perfect double-feature and you’re in luck because you can soon own Rogue One , which is available digitally on March 24th and on Blu-ray on April 4th. So get psyched to watch these films back-to-back for the first time!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T23:57:00.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
