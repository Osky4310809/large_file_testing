And fall he has. Although 2016 was hardly a lost year for the sport’s foremost star—he won two of the four Grand Slams—he stumbled from the summer onwards, succumbing in the third round at Wimbledon and in his opening match at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Such hiccups, combined with a surge by Andy Murray , caused him to lose the top spot in the Association of Tennis Professionals’ (ATP) world rankings to the Scot in November.\nMr Djokovic appeared to have righted his ship in recent weeks. Still the world’s best player according to the Elo method , he seemed to demonstrate firmly that he had not been surpassed by stomping Mr Murray in the final of the Qatar ExxonMobil Open earlier this month. But just when his disappointing streak was starting to look like a mere blip, Mr Djokovic gave new ammunition to his naysayers with a stunning loss. On January 19th at the Australian Open, a tournament he has won six times, he fell in the second round to Uzbekistan’s Denis Istomin , who currently sits outside the ATP’s top 100. Nothing in Mr Istomin’s past suggested he was capable of such a feat: in 33 previous matches against top-ten opponents, he had won only one . Bookmakers saw little reason to doubt the outcome of today’s match, offering odds that implied Mr Istomin’s chances of victory were a mere 3% or so. Mr Djokovic’s closely fought five-set defeat, 7-6(8) 5-7 2-6 7-6(5) 6-4, clears the path for Mr Murray, who has reached the event’s final five times and lost them all, to lift the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup at last. Betting markets now put him at even money to win.\nUpsets of this magnitude have always been uncommon in men’s singles. Between 1990 and 2005, a time span covering 64 Grand Slam events, players ranked first or second by the ATP lost in the first three rounds a total of 36 times—about once every second tournament. However, during the more recent era dominated by the “Big Four” of Mr Djokovic, Mr Murray, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , they have become far rarer. Just four such upsets have occurred in the 45 majors since 2006, including Mr Djokovic’s loss today and his early exit to Sam Querrey at Wimbledon last year. The other two are Lukas Rosol’s toppling of Mr Nadal at Wimbledon in 2012 and Andreas Seppi’s defeat of Mr Federer at the 2015 Australian Open.\nThe historical record does not suggest that such seemingly unthinkable slip-ups spell doom going forward. On one hand, following the 38 previous upsets of this magnitude that have occurred since 1990, 26 of the vanquished favourites (68%) saw their Elo ratings decrease further in the subsequent year. The average change was a decline of 23 Elo points—a bit less than half of Mr Djokovic’s current edge over Mr Murray. However, a similar tale could be told about players ranked first or second who didn’t suffer such an improbable defeat: 59% of them also lost ground in Elo over the following year, with an average change of a 16-point loss. Such is the power of regression toward the mean . It’s difficult—and rare—to retain a place at the summit of the sport for an extended period of time, no matter how one’s second-round match unfolds.\nMr Nadal’s career serves as a warning to forecasters not to place too much weight on any single loss. After falling to Mr Rosol and missing the remainder of the 2012 season, he won two majors the following year, taking over the ATP’s top ranking at the end of the 2013 season. Andre Agassi provides another reference point. In 2000, a few months older than Mr Djokovic is now and holding the number-one ranking, he lost in the second round at both the French and US Opens. But he recovered from those upsets to win the next major he played, the 2001 Australian Open, and made his last appearance at the top of the ranking table even later still, in 2003.\nThe nature of today’s loss provides another reason not to overreact. Mr Djokovic actually won a narrow majority (50.9%) of the 379 points played, and broke serve six times to Mr Istomin’s four. Elite players do typically outplay their competition by a wider margin —for example, Mr Djokovic won 57.7% of points in his five previous meetings with Mr Istomin—and as Donald Trump is fond of reminding the popular-vote victor Hillary Clinton, a win is a win. However, Mr Djokovic is known for mental strength that allows him to come out on top consistently even when the margins are thin.\nAlthough mismatches between the victor on points and the victor of a match are common in men’s tennis, they are quite unusual for Mr Djokovic. About 7.5% of matches are won by the player who tallies fewer points, and when one player takes between 50% and 51% of the points, he wins the match less than 65% of the time . By contrast, Mr Djokovic has won 30 of the 35 matches in which he has enjoyed such a slim advantage, seven or eight more than a standard expectation. Moreover, he has not lost a match while winning more than half of the points since the 2014 US Open, a streak of 169 straight victories. In over 700 previous career contests when he won the majority of points, he had suffered only nine losses . Twice in the first-set tiebreak against Mr Istomin, he was one point away from claiming the set. Had he converted either opportunity, there would be no carping about the former champion losing ground.\nIdentifying changes in a player’s ability is difficult given the dearth of granular data in tennis. Even fairly straightforward numbers like serve speed are only reliably tracked for a small number of top-level matches, so if Mr Djokovic has indeed lost a step, or is hitting fewer backhands close to his opponents’ baseline, it would be nearly impossible to know. Analysts are stuck looking primarily at aging curves, match results, and point totals, even when these most basic metrics are themselves contradictory.\nMeasured by either Elo or the ATP rankings, Mr Djokovic remains one of the two best players in the world, far beyond the reach of everyone except for Mr Murray. While he no longer appears to be the superhuman tennis machine of one year ago, it was unreasonable to expect that he could continue performing at such a high level. He is not too old to return to the top, as the example of Mr Agassi shows. Mr Istomin’s once-in-a-career stunner could prove to be a turning point for Mr Djokovic. But the smart money holds that it will probably still wind up an unfortunate asterisk in the gradual decline of an otherwise superb career.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2017/01/blogs/game-theory/20170121_blp520.jpg", "http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player.cgi?p=NovakDjokovic&f=ACareerqqTcxTPW-gt-50qqr1", "http://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2015/09/11/a-new-way-of-looking-at-lottery-matches", "http://www.tennisabstract.com/cgi-bin/player.cgi?p=DenisIstomin&f=ACareerqqITop_10qq", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Brookes", "http://novakdjokovic.com/en", "http://ig.ft.com/sites/novak-djokovic-the-best-tennis-season-ever", "http://www.oddsportal.com/tennis/australia/atp-australian-open/istomin-denis-djokovic-novak-pE3T8kzt", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Istomin", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean", "http://www.ausopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/1232ms.html", "http://www.inpredictable.com/2014/07/tennis-matches-and-luck.html", "http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/murray-djokovic-doha-2017-final", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi"], "published": "2017-01-20T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T09:21:52.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
