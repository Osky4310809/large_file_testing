The other features an image of Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), seemingly from the modern series. \nYou can check them out in the attached image gallery. \nWidely considered one of the most groundbreaking and influential broadcast series of all time, Twin Peaks followed the inhabitants of a quaint northwestern town who were stunned after their homecoming queen Laura Palmer was shockingly murdered. The town's sheriff welcomed the help of FBI agent Dale Cooper, who came to town to investigate the case. \nAs Cooper conducted his search for Laura's killer, the town's secrets were gradually exposed. The mystery that ensued set off an eerie chain of events that plunged the inhabitants of Twin Peaks into a darker examination of their very existence. Twenty-five years later, the story continues... \nTwin Peaks is written and produced by series creators and executive producers David Lynch and Mark Frost and is directed entirely by David Lynch. \nTwin Peaks returns with 18 new episodes to Showtime on May 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:42:02.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
