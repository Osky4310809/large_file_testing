Xiaomi Mi 6 could be the first smartphone with a Snapdragon 835 SoC By - January 9, 2017 “The Xiaomi Mi 6 will be the brand’s most powerful smartphone with a Snapdragon 835 SoC” \nSeveral reports in the past had suggested that the Xiaomi Mi 6 would be one of the first smartphones to utilise Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC. Now a Weibo user in China claims to have access to a screenshot, which shows the AnTuTu benchmark store for a prototype of the Mi 6. \nThe Xiaomi Mi 6’s alleged AnTuTu benchmark shows a whopping score of 2,10,329. At present, no smartphone around had recorded such a high score. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus had the highest AnTuTu score of 1,72,644, when AnTuTu released the list of top 10 devices in December last year. If the aforementioned AnTuTu score is correct, the Xiaomi Mi 6 will certainly be a Snapdragon 835 processor-powered smartphone. \nAs per earlier reports, the Xiaomi Mi 6 will come in a MediaTek Helio SoC-powered variant too. It is rumoured to come with a dual curved display, dual cameras, Android Nougat, and a beefy battery. The phone will reportedly be unveiled in China on February 14th, so stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T10:35:05.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
