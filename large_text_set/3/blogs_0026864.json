I thought I had to go through a stage in France. \n“I remember the generation of [Mamadou] Niang, [Franck] Ribery and [Samir] Nasri and it was a team that I liked, especially in the Champions League.” \nAs well as a Premier League winners’ medal, Kante also earned a £30m move to Chelsea off the back of his exploits at Leicester. \nHe is on course for a second successive title this season with Antonio Conte’s side.
