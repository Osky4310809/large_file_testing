Hinds\". Get it? Oh nevermind. 3 It's basically sciene at this point 2 binadra1234 5,490 · 5 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply I'm calling bullshit. There's no sound on the moon. The mean free path of molecules and atoms in that vacuum is so large that a sound wave would first be extremely faint - well below anything that we could sense with our instruments, and would also be at a frequency measured in cycles per day or week, not per second. So in any common sense, no there's no atmosphere, and no sound. 3 pressureproject 381 · 5 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Recording inside The Moon allows for measures to be put in place to avoid the complications presented by the lack of atmosphere on the surface. INSIDE The Moon you are perfectly capable of creating a controlled, closed environment in which to create the conditions necessary to record sound. So, rip again. 5 Talk about double standards. When Mastodon make a joke, they get upvotes. When you do it, you get downvotes. 3 Air_Stryker 195 · 5 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply Since the pick ups operate using an electromagnetic field you don't need an atmosphere to produce a signal. The vibrations of the string will be slightly different due to no air friction but that is probably negligible anyway. Feeding the input to an amplifier and then recording the output electrical signal from the amplifier is possible. So in principle it's not impossible. If it was an acoustic instrument on the othe hand you would be right 4 So I guess there's no album then? 0 Dude, you sound like a guy who goes to parties and over analyze every joke.. lol 10 ...you just over-analyzed my joke. 15", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T06:24:45.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
