Deadpool, Gaston and I are basically the same person. \nThere… that’s much better. \nIf you needed this comparison shown in the form of musical, then look no further than this hilarious “ Beauty and the Beast ” parody. \nLook, am I saying Belle should have ended up with Deadpool? \nYes. Yes, I am. \nThat’s… That’s not something I needed to hear. This musical parody has it all. It even has some cameos from the “X-Men” and “Avengers” franchises. YouTube \nAnd they look as annoyed with Deadpool as most women are with me within minutes of meeting yours truly. There’s even a singing head. You hear that, Disney ? It’s time to up your game. YouTube \nSide note: If I make it through 2017 and by the end of it, I’m just a talking head, I’ll still be pretty satisfied. Deadpool even has a dig ready for Black Widow based on the fact she used to boink a dude who turned green every time he got angry. YouTube \nMad props to Deadpool for having a Hulk stuffed animal prepared for this moment… Basially, this was me watching this hilarious mashup. YouTube \nMinus the cool glasses. I never have cool glasses. \nWell, I’m not sure what we did to deserve this amazing parody, but on behalf of everyone suffering through 2017, thank you. \nNow, if we could only have the entirety of “Deadpool” turned into a 90-minute musical, we’ll be set. \n*Calls Lin-Manuel Miranda, Lin-Manuel Miranda doesn’t know whom I am, Lin-Manuel Miranda appropriately hangs up the phone* \nWell, that went just as I expected. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
