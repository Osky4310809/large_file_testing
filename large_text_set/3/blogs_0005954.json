I figured the protest and counter protestors would have their moments but what I saw was beyond anything I thought would ever happen in a public park in this country. Armed 3 Percenters Militia were actively controlling sidewalks and not allowing some to pass in the George Roger’s Park (a public place) A female counter protester decided to embed herself near the gazebo area where March 4 Trump speakers were giving their talk and she was yelling something, probably to try and drown out their speech (which is also her right protected under the 1st Amendment). But the Trump supporters began surrounding her and shouting “USA! USA! USA!” which has become commonplace at these rallies and also protected speech but they then crossed the line and began pushing, grabbing, shoving and kettling the woman and proceeded to do this for nearly twenty minutes. Well known hate preacher Grant Chisholm attends March 4 Trump Some of the people engaged in this were 3 Percenters, which is a right wing militia group labeled by the government as a threat / hate group and at least one man had a white pride and confederate flag patch on and appeared to be a white supremacist based on those patches and some of the things he had been shouting. Lake Oswego police allowed 3 Percenters armed with sidearms and carrying tactical gear to act like police and also to use force against counter protestors with impunity. Several fights broke out, most instigated by Trump supporters and others instigated by people on the left while Lake Oswego police continued to standby and didn’t arrest anyone engaging in assault, despite them having enough of a presence and them observing it occur. As I was trying to leave, since things were rapidly getting out of control, I noticed a few individuals stopped a truck and after they moved out of the way one man stepped in front and the driver intentionally drove into him and he ended up on the truck’s hood. Instead of stopping, citing, or even arresting the truck driver who intentionally struck the man, they tackled the man who was hit by the truck driver and used significant force on him, apparently having even knocked him out. I would say most of the March 4 Trump participants, and even most of the counter protesters, were non-combative but there were folks on both sides engaging in instigation, with most of it coming from the Trump supporter side and the police only targeted leftists and pretty much allowed assaults by Trump supporters to continue with impunity. What has our country come to when militia groups that are known hate groups to the government are allowed by law enforcement to assault counter protestors in a public park with impunity? What has our country come to when the supporters of the President in office are yelling the N-word and other racist remarks at a rally supporting Trump?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T02:25:53.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
