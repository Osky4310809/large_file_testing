Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports \nBryan Stork didn’t play a down of football during the 2016 NFL season due to injuries, and now the former New England Patriots center has announced that he is retiring from the game of football. \nStork, who was let go by the Patriots prior to the start of the 2016 season, dealt with concussion issues while in college at Florida State University and during his first two seasons in the NFL. \nThe 26-year-old center made the announcement via Twitter on Tuesday night. \n— Bryan Stork (@BStork66) March 22, 2017 \nStork had a huge impact during his rookie season in 2014 when he started 11 games, including Super Bowl XLIX against the Seattle Seahawks. \nBut, Stork dealt with a myriad of injuries during his first two NFL seasons, which led the Patriots to try and trade him to the Washington Redskins last summer. Stork failed his physical, however, and the trade was rescinded. \nThe Patriots released the young center in August, opting to go with David Andrews at center, and Stork didn’t catch on with another team. \n  NESN.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T07:05:11.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
