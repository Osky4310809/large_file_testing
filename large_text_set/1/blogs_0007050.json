They grouch about the pagan roots associated with the holiday and insist that Christ never meant for us to commemorate his birth . \nTo me, Christmas is a time of joy. As followers of Jesus Christ, the resounding message in our Christmas celebrations ought to echo with notes of joy— joy to the world, joy to you and me ! My basis for this is Luke 2:10-11, when the Angel Gabriel announced, “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The Savior–yes, the Messiah, the Lord–has been born today in Bethlehem , the city of David! ” ( NLT ) The Good News of Christmas Is the Gospel \nThe gospel message is about the greatest gift of all time—God gave us Jesus Christ , his Son, who brings great joy to everyone who receives him. The purpose of Christmas is to share this gift. And what a perfect opportunity! \nChristmas is a holiday that focuses on the Savior of the world. I don't know about you, but that is why I celebrate Christmas. \nI wish to share this most wonderful gift so that you may experience the great joy of salvation. If you don’t know Jesus Christ as your Savior and you’d like to experience great joy , may I invite you to receive his gift of salvation right now, and join me in celebrating Christmas? It’s very simple. Here’s how: Admit you are a sinner. ( Romans 3:23 ; 10:9-10 ) Believe Jesus Christ died on the cross to save you from sin and death and give you eternal life. ( Romans 5:8 ; John 3:16 ) Recognize your sin before God and let him help you turn from your old life to a new life in Christ. ( Acts 3:19 ; 2 Corinthians 5:17 ) Receive , by faith in Jesus Christ, his free gift of salvation. ( Ephesians 2:8 ) \nIf you’ve just received Jesus … let me be the first to say Merry Christmas ! \nNow, why not celebrate by telling someone? You can leave a note on my Facebook page .
