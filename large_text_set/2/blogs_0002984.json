Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nChampions Leicester were sucked within two points of the bottom of the Premier League this weekend as they lost 3-0 to Manchester United while Sunderland and Hull both won. \nIf Crystal Palace fans were on a high from their January business and a midweek win they were brought crashing down to earth with the 4-0 hammering they suffered at the hands of the bottom of the table Black Cats. \nAnd the Tigers extended Liverpool's shocking start to 2017 with a 2-0 win at the KCOM Stadium - in what was a good weekend for teams with feline mascots. \nLast season it was Chelsea who, like Leicester, were suffering from second-season syndrome, but Antonio Conte's side took another big step towards the Premier League title with an impressive 3-1 victory over Arsenal. Eden Hazard is congratulated by team mates by scoring against Arsenal (Photo: REUTERS) \nManchester City's last-gasp winner against Swansea and Tottenham's narrow win over Middlesbrough kept some pressure on he runaway leaders, who still have a nine-point cushion at the top. \nUnlike their Merseyside rivals Everton are having a sensational 2017, which they continued with a 6-3 victory over Bournemouth. \nElsewhere Watford were 2-1 winners at home to Burnley, West Ham won at Southampton and Tony Pulis got one over his old side as West Brom beat Stoke 1-0. \nSo what did we learn from crucial weekend at both ends of the table? Schmeichel shows his disappointment as the Foxes season goes from bad to worse (Photo: REUTERS) 1. Leicester's dismal title defence \nHome fans chanted: “We are your champions” before being hit with a response of “going down” by the away support. \nLeicester's tally of 21 points from 24 games is the lowest-ever total by a reigning top-flight champion at this stage of a season. \nClaudio Ranieri's side are in grave danger of becoming the first champions to be relegated since Man City in 1938.

Swansea show spirit even in defeat \nThree Premier League wins in five under new boss Paul Clement, including an impressive 3-2 triumph at Liverpool, have boosted Swansea's hopes of avoiding the drop. \nIt was always going to be hard for Clement's players to maintain their winning run at City, but the Swans showed enough enterprise, organisation and character to suggest they have a fighting chance of survival, with only a goal in added time denying them what would have been a vital point.

Chelsea will have the title wrapped up by March \nChelsea finished the weekend 9 points clear at the top. It was a brilliant, well disciplined and hard-fought victory at Stamford Bridge. \nThe Blues are miles better than the rest, they have dominated the Premier League and Antonio Conte has outclassed his managerial rivals. \nThey have been fabulous this season. Chelsea will deserve to be champions - and they’ll wrap it up sooner rather than later. (John Cross) Read More Alfred N'Diaye scores the opening goal past Simon Mignolet (Photo: Nigel Roddis) 4. Liverpool need a new No.1 \nJurgen Klopp has tried Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius this season - and both have been found wanting. \nMignolet was caught out by David Luiz's quickly-taken free-kick and he dropped a real clanger to gift Hull the lead. \nHe was too tentative in dealing with Harry Maguire's header under pressure from Abel Hernandez and fumbled for Alfred N'Diaye to knock the ball home. \nMignolet appealed in vain for a foul, but he should have taken out Hernandez in clearing the ball.

Sunderland get a lifeline \nSelhurst Park has been a happy hunting ground for Sunderland in recent years. This is their third successive away win at Palace and has given them a lifeline. \nThey looked like goners after a poor January transfer window and slumping to the foot of the table in midweek. \nBut this shock win has breathed new life into their battle to beat the drop. They fully deserved it too as they filled their boots against a woeful Palace side. (Adrian Kajumba) Read More Bournemouth players look dejected during their defeat by Everton (Photo: AFP) 6. Howe must face up to relegation battle \nThey are not out of the relegation mire though, and much more of conceding goals this easily, and they'll be dragged right down into the fight at the bottom of the table. \nSunderland, Hull and Swansea have all shored up in recent weeks, recognising organisation is the key to survival. It is something Bournemouth must also address. (David Maddock) Read More Jake Livermore and Saido Berahino (Photo: PA) 7. Livermore looks the part \nMidfielder Jake Livermore, a £10million January signing from Hull, made his full West Brom debut in the centre of the park following Claudio Yacob's illness with suspected appendicitis. \nThe former Spurs trainee produced an all-action energetic display with numerous blocks to regain possession in a display that home fans loved.

West Ham are over Dimitri Payet \nSlaven Bilic's side were ripped apart by Manchester City in their first match after the acrimonious departure of the Frenchman. \nBut this was more like last season: Mark Noble pulling the strings, Andy Carroll running riot and a promising first start for Robert Snodgrass. \nThey won't finish seventh again this season but this was better. The chants for “Super Slav” were back too. (Neil McLeman) Read More Watford's M'Baye Niang celebrates scoring their second goal (Photo: REUTERS) 9. Say hello, wave M'baye \nWatford's new forward M'Baye Niang is an absolute beast. The French striker, on loan from AC Milan with a view to a £13.5 million permanent transfer in the summer, looks a bargain as replacement for £20m China Super League refugee Odion Ighalo. \nNiang was a handful at Arsenal on his debut in midweek, and Burnley – 10 men or otherwise - struggled to live with him here. \nThe quality of his cross for Troy Deeney to open the scoring was excellent; the quality of his glancing header to make it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time was sublime.

Defeat or a draw was not an option with Chelsea in danger of slipping the field. Spurs knew that Boro would go all out to prevent them doing it. \nIn fact, there was a touch of Jose Mourinho - Karanka long-friend friend and former boss - about the Boro intransigence. \nBut Spurs kept their heads to keep hammering at the door until Kane blew a hole in it. They’d scored in every previous Premier League home game this season. They knew they had it in them.
