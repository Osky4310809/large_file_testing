The actor made the shock announcement on BBC radio on Monday. “One of the greatest privileges of being Doctor Who is to see the world at its best,” he said. From our brilliant crew and creative team working for the best broadcaster on the planet, to the viewers and fans whose endless creativity, generosity and inclusiveness points to a brighter future ahead. I can’t thank everyone enough. It’s been cosmic.” Capaldi first stepped into the Tardis in 2013 and is set to leave in the Christmas 2017 special after three seasons at the same time as showrunner Steven Moffat exits the hit BBC sci-fi series. “For years before I ever imagined being involved in Doctor Who , or had ever met the man, I wanted to work with Peter Capaldi. I could not have imagined that one day we’d be standing on the Tardis together,” said Moffat. Like Peter, I’m facing up to leaving the best job I’ll ever have, but knowing I do so in the company of the best, and kindest and cleverest of men, makes the saddest of endings a little sweeter.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T02:20:33.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
