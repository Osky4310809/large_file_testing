A year later, Universal took the film off its slate. Fans were left wondering what happened, and during an AMA on the Reddit movies thread , Verbinski had an explanation for us. \nHe said, “Well it’s no short answer to that question but we were eight weeks prior shooting when the plug was pulled. It’s an R rated movie. I wanted to keep it R rated, I felt like that would be appropriate, and it’s an expensive movie. It’s a massive world we’re creating and it’s not a world we can simply go to locations to shoot. ‘A Cure For Wellness,’ we were able to really utilize a variety of location to create the world. ‘BioShock’ it wouldn’t work like that, we’d be building an entire underworld universe. So I think the combination of the price tag and the rating, Universal just didn’t feel comfortable ultimately. At that time also there were some R rated, expensive R rated movies that were not working. So I think things have changed and maybe there will be another chance, but it’s very difficult when you’re eight weeks away from shooting a movie you really can see in your head and you’ve almost filmed the entire thing, so emotionally you’re right at that transition from architect to becoming a contractor and that will be a difficult place to get back to.” \nComingSoon.net spoke to Verbinski about the defunct project back in 2011 while he was promoting the film Rango . \nVerbinski told us, “I couldn’t really get past anybody that would spend the money that it would take to do it and keep an R-rating. Alternately, I wasn’t really interested in pursuing a PG-13 version. Because the R rating is inherent. Little Sisters and injections and the whole thing. I just wanted to really, really make it a movie where, four days later, you’re still shivering and going, ‘Jesus Christ!’… It’s a movie that has to be really, really scary, but you also have to create a whole underwater world, so the price tag is high. We just didn’t have any takers on an R-rated movie with that price tag.” \nIf, as Verbinski says, things have changed and that there might be another chance, would you be interested in seeing a BioShock film after all this time? Who would you want to direct it?
