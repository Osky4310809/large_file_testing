Dating Relationships \nGuard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life. (NLT) \nSong of Solomon 4:9 You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace. (ESV) \nRomans 12:1–2 Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. (NASB) \n1 Corinthians 6:18 Run from sexual sin ! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. (NLT) \n1 Corinthians 15:33 Do not be deceived: \"Bad company ruins good morals.\" (ESV) \n2 Corinthians 6:14–15 Don't team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever? (NLT) \n1 Timothy 5:1b-2 ...Talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers. Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters.

And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed. (ESV) \nProverbs 31:10–11 Who can find a virtuous and capable wife? She is more precious than rubies. Her husband can trust her, and she will greatly enrich his life. (NLT) \nMatthew 19:5 ...and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh' ... (NKJV) \n1 Corinthians 7:1–40 ...Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control ...

Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her ... In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself ... and let the wife see that she respects her husband. Read entire text . (ESV) \n1 Peter 3:7 In the same way, you husbands must give honor to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God's gift of new life. Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.

Then you will live a long, full life in the land the LORD your God is giving you.\" (NLT) \nLeviticus 19:3 \"Each of you must respect his mother and father, and you must observe my Sabbaths. I am the LORD your God.\" (NIV) \nDeuteronomy 5:16 \"Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you.\" (NIV) \nPsalm 127:3 Children are a gift from the LORD; they are a reward from him. (NLT) \nProverbs 31:28–31 Her children stand and bless her. Her husband praises her: \"There are many virtuous and capable women in the world, but you surpass them all!\" Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the LORD will be greatly praised. Reward her for all she has done. Let her deeds publicly declare her praise. (NLT) \nJohn 19:26–27 When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved, he said to her, \"Dear woman, here is your son.\" And he said to this disciple, \"Here is your mother.\" And from then on this disciple took her into his home.
