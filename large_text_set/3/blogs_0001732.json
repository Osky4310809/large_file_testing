Durant suffered the injury one minute into the game when Warriors center Zaza Pachulia fell into Durant's leg. \nAccording to the Warriors, Durant underwent an MRI last night at MedStar Washington Hospital in the DC area, and was diagnosed with a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise . Durant will be re-evaluated in four weeks, and while the team says there is no timetable for his return, they also said a return this season has not been ruled out. Injury Update: Kevin Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise. Full details below. pic.twitter.com/t3JkVnMmqa — Warriors PR (@WarriorsPR) March 1, 2017 \nDurant leads the team in scoring (25.3 points per game), free throw makes (5.5) and attempts (6.3) per game, rebounding (8.2 rpg) and blocks (1.6 bpg). \nGolden State added Durant in the offseason in the biggest move of the summer, signing him to a two-year deal (which has an opt-out this summer) as the high-powered Warriors added the 2013-14 Kia MVP. Entering last night, Durant had appeared in 58 of 59 games for the Warriors, missing last Saturday's date against the Brooklyn Nets with a left hand contusion . \nFor the Warriors, Durant's injury could not have come at a worse time. They are entering a portion of their schedule that head coach Steve Kerr called \"the most insane schedule I've ever seen in all my years in the NBA.\" The 50-10 Warriors currently have the best record in the NBA, and with 22 games remaining hold a four game lead over the San Antonio Spurs (45-13) for the top spot in the Western Conference playoff race. \nDurant was injured when teammate Zaza Pachulia fell backwards into his left leg while grappling with Wizards center Marcin Gortat less than a minute into the first quarter. He hobbled through two more possessions before leaving for good. 0:20 Play \nKevin Durant leaves last night's game vs. Washington with an injury. Kevin Durant expected back for the postseason, multiple sources told ESPN. “It’s not as bad as it looked,” one source said. — Jeff Goodman (@GoodmanESPN) March 1, 2017 Kevin Durant hasn't been ruled out that he could return to the court before the end of the regular season. — Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) March 1, 2017 All in all, good news for Kevin Durant and Warriors, team says: Sprained MCL, bone bruise. He will be re-evaluated in a month. — Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) March 1, 2017 Durant will be re-evaluated in four weeks. No timetable for return, but possible he could return before the end of the regular season. (2/2) — David Aldridge (@daldridgetnt) March 1, 2017 With unknown status of Durant, race for #1 seed gains added importance. Get homecourt, avoid Rockets. Update: pic.twitter.com/lwjsI6XkSM — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) March 1, 2017 The Durant MRI results seem to be good news for the Warriors. Re-evaluated doesn't mean will return. But appears his season isn't over. — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) March 1, 2017 \nLast season the Warriors finished with an NBA-record 73 wins , but after defeating Durant and the Thunder in the Western Conference Finals, lost in the NBA Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who overcame a 3-1 deficit. \nAfter the last night's game, a somber mood was present in the Warriors' locker room over the status of Durant's future. Anthony Slater of The Mercury News has more on that and some postgame comments from Durant's teammates : \nPachulia said he had no idea Durant was behind him and initially had no idea he’d injured the star forward. He didn’t blame the reckless loose ball foul on Gortat, calling it “just a basketball play” and asked inquiring reporters: “You guys think I did it on purpose or something?” \nTwenty minutes after the loss, the Warriors opened the locker room to the press. Durant had been gone for some time, already off for testing. His teammates had yet to see him and gauge his mood. Some said they texted him encouragement. But the mood in the room was silent and decidedly somber, much more so than a typical regular season loss. \n“Obviously KD is the No. 1 reason (for the mood),” Pachulia said. \n“We’re not going to act like he died when we don’t even know what happened,” Green said. “We don’t know what’s going on.” \nThe Warriors have 22 games left, spanning the next six weeks, before the playoffs begin on April 15. If Durant’s return timetable falls anywhere before that — in the next few weeks or right before the first round — the Warriors will breathe a sigh of relief. \n... \n“The core guys have been together for awhile — myself, Andre, Shaun, Klay, Draymond,” Curry said. “But we have a different roster and we haven’t been without him but one game this year. So it’ll be an adjustment.” \nCopyright © 2017 NBA Media Ventures, LLC.
