So while Twitter was able to essentially operate more efficiently. it still isn’t doing the job it needs to be doing in monetizing its user base. \nTwitter added 2 million new users, and is now up to 319 million monthly active users — which is a trickle, but that’s kind of to be expected for Twitter right now as it has yet to make an drastic product changes. Not surprisingly, the stock is once again getting punished, and was down as much as 10% in pre-market trading. \nTwitter needed to show that it could have a strong fourth quarter given that the U.S. presidential election — probably one of the most Twitter zeitgeist-y moments of all time — happened. Beyond that, President Donald Trump is also an active Twitter user, giving it additional strength as a go-to platform for news.

Part of the problem that even posed issues for the company in those talks was that it was the home of a lot of harassment and abuse, which at the time still had not been addressed at a product level.\nTwitter, to that extent, has started making some moves toward silencing abuse in order to curb the harassment problem that’s plagued the platform throughout its existence. Twitter, which has traditionally moved slow and incrementally — as so not to scare off its highly devoted users with too drastic changes — is at least trying to point itself and its product roadmap in the right direction. \nFor some perspective, just looking at Twitter’s stock price in the past year — with the huge spike below being acquisition talks — that says quite a bit about the state of the product in Wall Street’s eyes under year-ish-long CEO Jack Dorsey.
