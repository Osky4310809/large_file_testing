As Recode reports , Target's aptly named \"Store of the Future\" project, which would have put the retailer in direct competition with Amazon's forthcoming cashier-free Go stores , was abruptly canceled after a disappointing holiday season.\nAccording to Recode 's sources, the new, smaller stores were slated to debut sometime this year and an internal team had already begun building out a test version. Instead of the normal rows and aisles most Target customers are used to, the Store of the Future would look more like a showroom and employ a team of robots to pick up items and bring them to customers at checkout. The stores also had an e-commerce component and Target intended to use the spaces to encourage other, non-retail experiences and community gatherings.\nTarget was also building out a new online marketplace codenamed Goldfish that would have compete with Amazon online and allowed third parties to sell their goods through a Target platform. According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune , the San Francisco-based Goldfish team led by former Paypal exec West Stringfellow was recently let go , leading to some confusion internally. In a statement to Recode , the company said it had to make \"tough choices\" to it's innovation portfolio, but \"remains absolutely committed to pursuing what's next.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.recode.net/2017/2/2/14484278/target-innovation-projects-shut-down-store-future-goldfish", "http://www.startribune.com/target-cuts-innovation-initiatives-including-secretive-goldfish-start-up/412442553/"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:08:59.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
