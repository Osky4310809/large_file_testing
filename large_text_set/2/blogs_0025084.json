Gage Skidmore/Flickr.com \nUnivision, NBC and Macy’s all parted ways with Donald Trump in June 2015 after he linked undocumented immigrants from Mexico to rape and drugs while announcing his bid for president. \n“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best; they’re not sending you,” Trump told his supporters on June 16, 2015. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” \nWhen Univision decided not to air Trump’s Miss America pageant as a result of his xenophobic remarks, he responded by suing the Spanish-language network for $500 million. Boldly unrepentant, the mogul refused to apologize for his comments about Mexicans, blaming the backlash against him on political correctness run amuck. He even doubled down on his characterization of unauthorized immigrants as criminals during a July 1, 2015, interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. \n“Well, somebody’s doing the raping, Don,” Trump said. “I mean somebody’s doing it. Who’s doing the raping? Who’s doing the raping?” \nTrump’s refusal to back away from his anti-Mexican comments shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone familiar with his long history of offensive statements. An undercurrent of racism has run through Trump’s remarks for decades, as evidenced by the quotes and anecdotes below: \nSued For Racial Discrimination \nThe U.S. Department of Justice sued Donald Trump’s real-estate company, Trump Management Corporation, for racial discrimination in 1973 for allegedly refusing to rent apartments to blacks and lying to them about rental conditions and prices. \n“Because he is a complete and utter clown, Trump responded by suing the D.O.J. for defamation, seeking $100 million in damages,” the Village Voice reported . “Trump's lawyer was the infamous Roy Cohn, a.k.a. Joseph McCarthy's chief counsel. Eventually Trump Management settled the case, but failed to improve their policies towards minorities: three years later, the Justice Department again charged the company with discriminating against blacks. It got to the point where the NYC human rights commission was dispatched to find evidence of discrimination in Trump's buildings.” \nIn addition to this debacle, sample quotes attributed to Trump for a 1991 book by John R. O'Donnell reveal a racist and anti-Semitic streak. The mogul reportedly remarked that \"laziness is a trait in blacks\" and he doesn’t like blacks to handle his money. \n\"Black guys counting my money! I hate it,” Trump reportedly said. “The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.\" \nRefusal to Apologize to Central Park 5 \nDonald Trump has a history of not apologizing for offensive behavior. In 2002, supporters of the Central Park 5, five black youth wrongfully convicted of raping a white woman in the park 13 years earlier, asked Trump to apologize for running newspaper ads targeting the then teen suspects. Although the ad did not identify anyone by name, it warned “criminals of every age” accused of the crime “to be afraid.” It mentioned how Trump wanted “to hate these muggers and murderers” and stated that “they should be forced to suffer.” \nCentral Park 5 supporters viewed the ad as a rush to judgment against the group of black boys accused of the rape and expressed concern that it influenced the jury to wrongfully convict them. The quintet was vindicated after convicted rapist Matias Reyes confessed to the crime. DNA evidence backed up Reyes’ confession, but Trump not only refused to apologize to the Central Park 5 in 2002 after this news spread, he slammed the fact that the group won a settlement in 2014 because of their wrongful conviction.
