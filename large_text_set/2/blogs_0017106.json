Miley, along with mom Tish Cryus , dad Billy Ray Cyrus, brothers Trace and Braison Cyrus, and older sister Brandi Cyrus were all there for what looks to be a really relaxing weekend.\nSince the farm is breathtaking, and since she was surrounded by almost her entire family (except for younger sister Noah Cyrus), Miley couldn’t help but post a bunch of photos to Instagram. Most notably, she posted a picture of a homemade t-shirt that her dad made her , and the message is beautiful. “Don’t think inside the box, don’t think outside the box, think like there is no box,” the message reads. It’s the perfect dad message.\nA post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Feb 19, 2017 at 10:51am PST \n“Homemade present from da @billyraycyrus Since I was a little he always encouraged me to be myself & I think #outsidethebox I ammmm who I ammmm because he taught me to stay that way ! ,” she captioned the photo.\nWe’d like to have the shirt made for everyone we know.\n\nPlus, Miley posted a ton of other photos from this past weekend.
