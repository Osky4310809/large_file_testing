PUBLISHED: 05:30, Tue, Jan 3, 2017 | UPDATED: 05:55, Tue, Jan 3, 2017 BETHESDA A Fallout 4 fans spotted something a bit strange in a recent CNN report \nThe news network mistakenly used footage from Bethesda’s blockbuster game to report on a breaking story coming out of the US, concerning Russian hackers. \nFootage of a Fallout 4 terminal appeared during a video which was aired late last month and was used during a segment discussing Donald Trump’s reaction to Moscow’s alleged involvement in “Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities.” \nWhile hacking terminals in Fallout 4 is pretty fun, it unfortunately doesn’t really resonate with the alleged goings-on in the US right now. \nFirst of all, the Fallout universe is without the internet, timelines diverge with ours following the Second World War, with the Fallout version of historical event never reaching the point where the internet was invented. \nThe glaring error was spotted by an eagle-eyed reddit user who then posted the blunder online. CNN CNN uses Fallout 4 terminal footage \nOne gamer replied: \"If you want to talk about hacking on a major news network, your choices are either that or a scene from The Matrix.” \nAnother added: “What about a guy wearing a hoodie and you can't see his face, he's sitting in a dark room, and you play ominous music, spooky.” \nBethesda responded in a roundabout way to the news of CNN using Fallout 4 footage for its story, with Studio VP Pete Hines posting a tongue-in cheek response on Twitter. \n“Wait till they discover FO4 players were actually helping Russians and cracking real security through that mini game,” he tweeted.

Having it work just like other platforms was not approved. This version was.” Most read in Gaming", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T08:02:27.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
