Indians are Uneducated \nThis is probably the worst and most inaccurate stereotype -- that Indians aren't educated (they drive taxis and work in 7-Eleven stores). The truth is that education is extremely important in India. Even poor village families strive to give their children the best education possible because they know it's the key to a better future. Doctors and engineers top the list of professions in India. MBAs and PhDs are common qualifications. India also has plenty of business schools, and the government is working hard on providing quality higher education. The education system in India is competitive and challenging, and children are given exams from a young age. Children commonly go to extra tuition after school just to get ahead, especially in big cities. Boris Breuer\\Getty Images 6. Cows Roam the Roads \nOne of the first things that usually comes to mind when people think of India is holy cows. They've got quite a reputation. And the question that's often asked is, \"Do cows really roam on the roads even in cities in India?\" This stereotype is actually true. It won't take you long to spot your first cow. They can even be found chilling on the beaches in Goa! Cows wandering the streets do pose a problem though. They will fearlessly walk out in front of traffic, so drivers need to be extra cautious.

Indian Cuisine is all Butter Chicken \nWhile the Punjabi cuisine served in Indian restaurants across the world sure is tasty and popular, it's not an accurate representation of what Indian food really is. In fact, each region in India has its own style of cooking. In Kerala, the use of coconut is popular. In Kolkata, the menu commonly features seafood such as fish or prawns. Down south, rice is favored. In the north, people prefer Indian bread such as naan cooked in the tandoor .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:30:33.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
