Silicon Valley has exchanged its standard hoodie-based uniform for something a bit more festive and has made its way over to the War Memorial Opera House to celebrate the 10th Annual Crunchies . Like last year’s show, tonight’s host is comedian and actress Chelsea Peretti. \nAfter an open nomination process, the members of our Crunchies board voted for the finalists over the last few weeks and tonight we’ll announce the winners. \nThere are 11 awards up for grabs tonight. Those range from “VC of the Year” and “Angel of the Year” to awards for “Best Technology,” “Founder of the Year,” and “Best Startup.” The TechCrunch Include Award for “an organization or individual that has advanced inclusion in tech” also returns for the second year in a row. New this year is an award for best startup video. \nThe show starts at 8pm Pacific and for those of you who couldn’t make it, we’ll keep a running tab of all the winners in the list below. \nWe will update this post throughout the evening. \nCongratulations to all our winners! \nVC of the Year \nKirsten Green, Forerunner Ventures (winner) Kirsten is the founder of Forerunner Ventures, an early stage venture capital firm.
