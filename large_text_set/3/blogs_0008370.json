What makes the feeling worse is the sinking thought that, yep, this probably could have been avoided if you had been more mindful or intentional in remembering. Now, new research seems to indicate you can head off that horrible forgetting sensation with sheer willpower and practice. According to Science Daily , researchers from Nueron reported that after 40 days of daily 30-minute training sessions, individuals with typical memory skills doubled their memory capacity. After four months, without any additional training, their recall performance remained high. \nStudy participants were given a list of 72 words and asked to remember as many names as they could. Before the training they recalled an average of 26 words, and after the training they recalled an average of 62. “After training we massively increased performance on memory tests,” says first study author Martin Dresler, assistant professor of cognitive neuroscience at Radboud University Medical Center. “Not only can you induce a behavioral change, the training also induces similar brain connectivity patterns as those seen in memory athletes.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:23:14.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
