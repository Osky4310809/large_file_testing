But it turns out Warner Bros. believes you can never have too many giant, naked, human-chomping monsters. Advertisement \nDeadline reports that Warner Bros. is currently in talks for the live-action rights to Hajime Isayaba’s seminal Attack on Titan franchise. The plans allegedly involve a western remake of the two-part, live-action movie that was released in Japan in 2015, itself a loose adaptation of the opening arcs of Isayama’s manga about the surviving remnants of the human race living in a walled-off enclave of cities and towns to protect themselves from giant, human-devouring humanoid beings called Titans. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them producer David Heyman is allegedly attached to the project, should the rights be secured. \nWhile the popularity of Attack on Titan has waned a bit since its true peak, it’s still one of the biggest Japanese properties around, so it makes sense that Warner Bros. would be interested in trying to get its hands on the moviemaking rights. Whether it’ll be worth it by the time a western Attack on Titan movie comes out, however, remains to be seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T17:25:57.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
