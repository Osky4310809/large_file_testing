Watch this space.” John wants to reintroduce student grants (Photo: REX) John as Nick Cotton with his on screen mum Dot (played by June Brown) (Photo: BBC) John first appeared on EastEnders in 1985 Read More EastEnders fans thrilled when June Brown's onscreen son John Altman interrupts TV tribute filming with flowers \nHe feels passionately about education spending and a reintroduction of grants, as well as improving the state of the roads after a cyclist died in Surrey last year when he collided with a pothole. \n“There seem to be a lot of boys from Harrow and Eton becoming famous now,” he explains.“I think it’s very wrong that people can’t afford to go to college. John isn't sure which party he'll stand for yet (Photo: DAILY MIRROR) \n“ Tony Blair introducing student loans was a disgrace. That is one of the top five things I would eliminate. I would put the money that they put into billion pound missiles back into education. \n“Having that debt is not a good start in life and it’s not going to encourage new talent from across the board to emerge and keep out country great. It’s counter productive.” \nJohn recently surprised his former screen mum June Brown during BBC's celebratory tribute for her 90th birthday. \nHe played Dot Cotton's son Nick in EastEnders.
