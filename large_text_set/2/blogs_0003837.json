Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \n\nTrump predicted earlier in the night the Patriots, with his good friends Bill Belichick and Tom Brady leading the way, all paid by his buddy Robert Kraft, would defeat the Falcons by eight points.\n“I hate making predictions. I hate to do it,” he told Fox News about two hours before kickoff. “But I’ll say … I don’t even know what are the odds, but it’s pretty even, right? Two great teams. Pretty even. So I’ll say the Patriots will win.”\nThe president’s motorcade left the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., before 9 p.m. Sunday night, according to reports , while he continued to listen to the game on radio.\nTrump’s chances of making it through the game didn’t look good from the start. The disgust on his face said it all as he sat at a decorated table next to wife Melania and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, watching his Patriots dig themselves into an early hole.\n. @realDonaldTrump flanked by Reince Priebus & @MELANIATRUMP at #SuperBowl party. pic.twitter.com/ZQhW3rUykA \n— George Bennett (@gbennettpost) February 6, 2017 \n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:23:38.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
