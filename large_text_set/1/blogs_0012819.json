This being said, this vote does not repeal the Affordable Care Act. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is and will be a multistep process. Therefore, today’s vote does not in any way impact your current healthcare coverage. What will happen when the House does fully repeal the Affordable Care Act? Improving our nation’s healthcare system is not about pulling the rug out from under those who have health insurance. The Affordable Care Act will be phased out over a set period of time laying way to more affordable and higher quality healthcare options for all Americans. No one who has coverage because of the Affordable Care Act today, will lose that coverage the day it’s repealed. I have a pre-existing condition. How will this affect me? I will work hard to ensure the replacement for the Affordable Care Act includes protections for those with pre-existing conditions. I am under the age of 26 and am on my parent’s health insurance. How will this affect me? The importance of young people having access to the care they need is paramount. I am in support of continuing this provision in the replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Going forward… No one who has coverage because of the Affordable Care Act today, will lose that coverage the day it’s repealed. However, throughout the implementation of the Affordable Care Act we have seen premiums rise and quality falter, some states’ marketplace’s only offering one healthcare option. This is not an exchange — this is a monopoly. The replacement for the Affordable Care Act will be constructed through a deliberate, well thought out, and public process that will ensure every American has access to healthcare options that are affordable, patient-centered, and provide them with the care they need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T00:34:28.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
