Gov Kashim Shettima of Borno State. \nIndimi, whose son recently married Zara, President Buhari’s most popular daughter, gave his verdict while receiving Governor Shettima at his expanse residence in Maiduguri on Thursday evening. \nThe Governor’s visit was to follow up on Indimi’s pledge to make huge contributions in areas of infrastructure and agriculture to support ongoing efforts by the Government to rebuild homes, rehabilitate and resettle internally displaced persons in safe communities destroyed by insurgents. \n“‎What you are doing in Borno State despite small resources is unbelievable. I don’t know how you do it. You have completely changed the faces of Maiduguri. I have been to many states and I can say that many leaders do not come close to what you are doing in Borno State. \nIn the past, whenever I had foreign visitors coming to visit me in Maiduguri, I made sure they arrived Maiduguri at night so that they wouldn’t see horrible sights, but today, I make sure my visitors come in the day time because I am proud of what they will see on entering Maiduguri. If you arrive Maiduguri today, you will know there is Government in place. The city is becoming more and more beautiful and I am very proud because today my State (Borno) can compete with any State in this country. Sometimes I feel as if I am the one telling you what to do and the reason is that most of your developmental projects are things I always wish for Borno. \nI don’t know how your mind works, maybe from your background, but really you are doing so many things and we have to support you” Indimi said. \nThe Billionaire said in addition to what he sees going on, he had sent a group of his children to visit sights of some ongoing Government projects taking place outside the city centre and the reports he got were very positive. Indimi promised to intervene in areas of modern agriculture so as to create livelihoods for internally displaced persons who return to safe communities. \n“What I want to do is get closer to Bama, where I can get atleast 1000 or 2000 hectares of cultivable land to build modern farms that at least half of returnees can earn their livelihoods by the time people from the city depend on their produce. I want to do the same in other locations like Ngala and other places. Apart from farming, I will support in the area of infrastructure. \nI am sure between now and 2019, if am alive, insha Allah, I will fund some projects but it is for you to decide what you want us to do. I really appreciate what you are doing in Borno State, honestly and we will support you, insha Allah. ‎I also want to appreciate your humility. \nI requested to come to see you in your office at the Government House but you insisted on coming to my house. I thank you for the honour” Indimi said to Shettima. \nThe Billionaire business man said efforts must be combined to rebuild the economy of Borno State with particular focus given the places like Baga where nearly 50% of Borno’s economy was coming from prior to insurgent attacks.Governor Shettima thanked Indimi for his passion describing his offers as overwhelming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T10:03:46.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
