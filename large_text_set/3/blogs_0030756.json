Carpenter shot back, “She’s not qualified!” \nAs they kept going back and forth, McEnany even told Carpenter, “You are doing more harm to the cause of feminism by tearing down another woman ruthlessly.” \nCarpenter laughed and said if Ivanka Trump “wants to be treated like a political person,” that’s what she’s going to do. She argued that there are plenty of women in government far more qualified for a position with security clearance. \nMcEnany asked if she had a problem with Hillary Clinton ‘s role in her husband’s White House . Carpenter said this in response: \n“I’m the one that’s being consistent here… I’m a consistent conservative. I have a problem with nepotism, whether it’s Bill Clinton, whether it’s Donald Trump. So there’s no there there, Kayleigh. You’re the one that goes back and forth and… changes your views based on the political party.” \nYou can watch the whole thing above, via CNN. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T05:54:28.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
