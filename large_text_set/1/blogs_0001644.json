Key points: Republicans take control of both houses Controversial move to dump ethics watchdog cancelled after Mr Trump's tweets Resolution introduced to repeal Obamacare \nWith Mr Trump set to be sworn in as president on January 20, Republicans will control both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2007, and they were set to begin laying plans for enacting his agenda of cutting taxes and rolling back financial and environmental regulations. \nBut the moment was overshadowed by a surprise move by Republicans in the House of Representatives in a closed-door meeting late on Monday to weaken the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which is in charge of investigating ethics accusations against elected representatives. \nMr Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to \"drain the swamp\" and bring ethics reforms to Washington, was not pleased. External Link: Donald Trump tweet: \" may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS\" \nThe ethics office was created in 2008 following several corruption scandals but some politicians have said in recent years that it has been too quick to investigate complaints lodged by outside partisan groups. \nThe Republicans wanted to have greater control of the watchdog, and inserted changes into a broader rules package, set to pass when the House convenes. \nEven before Mr Trump's tweet, many House Republicans, including top leaders, opposed the measure and worried about its ramifications. \nMr Trump's tweet prompted an emergency meeting and a quick change of course by Republicans. \n\"It was taken out by unanimous consent,\" said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was re-elected to the role during the sitting. \nMr Ryan will serve his first full term as Speaker after succeeding John Boehner in October 2015. \nHe said his message to the American people is that \"we hear you, we will do right by you and we will deliver\". \n\"You can feel the winds of change,\" he said. \nDemocratic leader Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats will seek common ground with Republicans when they can on issues such as investing in the nation's infrastructure and making sure taxes and foreign trade are fair to workers. Obamacare repeal process begins \nSince his election on November 8, Mr Trump has made clear he wants to move swiftly to enact proposals he outlined during his campaign. \nThese include simplifying the tax code, slashing corporate tax rates and repealing and replacing Mr Obama's signature health insurance program known as Obamacare.

(Reuters: Carlos Barria) \nLeading Democrats warned of a fierce battle over Obamacare and said they planned to mobilise grassroots support for it. \nRepublican Senator Mike Enzi introduced a resolution to repeal the program — officially called the 2010 Affordable Care Act — after years of GOP opposition to the act . \nThe Republicans are using a budget resolution to provide the repeal, allowing them to act without any Democratic votes. \nBudget resolutions require a simple majority to pass in the Senate, instead of the 60 votes normally required to clear procedural hurdles. \nThere are 52 Republicans in the 100-seat chamber. \nA Senate vote on the resolution could come next week, with action in the House of Representatives expected to follow. \n\"These instructions to committees are provided to facilitate immediate action on repeal, with the intent of sending legislation to the new president's desk as soon as possible,\" a statement from Mr Enzi's office said. \nMr Obama is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with congressional Democrats to discuss strategies for fending off the Republican attacks on Obamacare. \nRepublican politicians also want to curtail regulations aimed at controlling industrial emissions that contribute to climate change, and roll back banking industry reforms enacted after the near-collapse of Wall Street in 2008. \nReuters/AP First posted January 04, 2017 05:54:36 US election coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:26:35.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
