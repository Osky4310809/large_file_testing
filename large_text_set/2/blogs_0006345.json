The original '90s The Magic School Bus followed Valerie and her students as they learn about different school subjects. Each 30-minute episode had the class and magic bus visiting new locations, from a seemingly haunted house to the inside of one student's digestive system. Lily Tomlin, another member of the Netflix family, voiced the lovably kooky teacher in the original.\nThe Netflix reboot will feature modern updates to the bus and to Frizzle herself, as well as CG-animation to add realism to the characters. Let's hope Miss Frizzle's pet lizard remains.\nBONUS: Here's how the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' characters compare to the original", "external_links": ["http://people.com/tv/kate-mckinnon-starring-netflix-revival-the-magic-school-bus-rides-again/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9NvfwHkg.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9NvfwHkg.m3u8"], "published": "2017-02-09T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T21:39:18.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
