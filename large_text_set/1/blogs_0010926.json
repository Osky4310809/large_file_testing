He too old,” Kodak Black says amid several moments of silence. \nOn Being Done With All the “Bull-Crap” \n“I can’t win from losing, so gotta stay level-headed.” \nOn Having A Mentor In The Game \n“I mean, if Master P ever holler at me, I’d holler at him.” \nOn How He’s Going To Celebrate Black History Month \n“I’m finna drop my Cutlass.” \nOn What He Bought First After Getting Out Of Jail \n“I had about a hundred condoms. I had to see what that hot and cold thing do, but I don’t like it. It be burning after that.” \n“Even if he said it first, you’re probably like 50 years old.” \nOn Wale Writing To Him In Jail \n“At least he took his time to write a nigga.” \nOn His Dad Reaching Out \n“A part of me was like, one day he’s gonna die, and I’m gonna be like … then I’ll be like dang … Another part of me, yeah…” \nOn His Mom Getting A Boyfriend One Day \n“As long as she cook for me.” \nOn His Girl’s Reaction To Kodak Accidentally Exposing Himself On Instagram Live \n“She wasn’t mad about that. She thought I dropped it on purpose ’cause she know me.” \n“Nigga you know who I am. Nicki Minaj knows who I am.” \nOn How He’s Keeping His Career Moving \n“I’ve been innovating.” \nOn Whether He’s A Clone In That Ski Mask \n“I’m Tupac resurrected.” \nOn Why He’s Going To Put Kirk Franklin On His Album \n“Ain’t no rappers doing that.” Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You!
