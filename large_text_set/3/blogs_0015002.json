Congratulations @BJP4India on the landslide win in UP. The pair of PM @narendramodi & @AmitShah went past 300-mark like a #TracerBullet \n— Ravi Shastri (@RaviShastriOfc) March 16, 2017 \nIn his tweet to PM on Thursday, Shashtri had also used his famous phrase \"Tracer Bullet\" while complimenting the Modi-Shah combine as batsmen. \nResponding to Shastri's tweet, PM Modi replied right back using cricketing language. Thank you. UP polls did not quite go down to the wire. But, at the end of the day democracy is indeed the real winner! :) https://t.co/suoTqZtXit \n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 16, 2017 \nInterestingly BJP president Amit Shah was also not too far behind the PM in giving a humorous response to former cricketer's congratulatory tweet. \nIn his tweet to Shastri, Shah explained how BJP played as team and how its Karyakartas helped it win up 300+ seats in the 403-seat UP Asembly. Thank you @RaviShastriOfc . Team BJP piled up 300+ on the back of many singles that our karyakartas and Modi government took along the way. https://t.co/MiffG9BRuB \n— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) March 16, 2017 \nThe use of cricketing metaphors by both PM modi and Shah thrilled hundreds of Twitter users who heaped praise on the BJP leaders for their ''wit and humour''. \nHere are some of those responses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T13:38:25.843+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
