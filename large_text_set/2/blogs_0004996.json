Because earlier today during the Walt Disney Company Q1 FY17 earnings meeting, Disney chairmen and CEO Bob Iger announced that both Walt Disneyland in Anaheim, California and Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida will be opening it’s Star Wars themed lands to the public in 2019!\nTalk about “A Galaxy Far, far away!” Though rightfully so, since these are the largest single-themed land expansions Disney has ever developed. I for one want Disney to take their time with this one. I want them to pull out all the stops and “wow” us like the creative team did behind the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Toss aside the mundane theme park layout and really show us something new and exciting! With park prices rising (it feels like ever third quarter,) It’s easy for fans to just stay home and get more out of their favorite franchises. We need something that we cannot get out of a VR headset experience on our couches. Hopefully, this is the answer!\nvia travelandlesisure.com\nAt each location, fans will arrive at a remote trading port. From there you will enter an all new planet in the Star Wars Universe. Here, guests will walk the market streets smelling and tasting some of the best delicacies this side of the universe has to offer. We also know that there will be a fully immersive Millennium Falcon ride, where you will step aboard the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs.\nCostumed characters will be plentiful around the parks. Whether they are welcoming, or have other agendas in mind, only time will tell.\nvia collider.com\nWe also know there will be a large restaurant that will serve food that is out of this galaxy and a new “battle ride” that will make Star Tours look and feel like a kiddie ride. Disney may actually break out some of their trackless ride mechanics that they have shown off at their other locations around the world.\nOnly time will tell what is to come from the fully immersive Star Wars experience dropped in the middle of (both) happiest places on earth. Sadly, we have an abundance of time on our hands until the attractions open. Think about it. We’ll have almost finished the new trilogy of films and the Young Han Solo film by then. My guess is Disney wants to have these parks open when Episode IX hits theaters. Talk about a great day at the parks!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:05:49.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
