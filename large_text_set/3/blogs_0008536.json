Spanning over 60,000 light-years, the peculiar elliptical galaxy also known as NGC 5128 , is featured in this sharp telescopic view. Centaurus A is apparently the result of a collision of two otherwise normal galaxies resulting in a fantastic jumble of star clusters and imposing dark dust lanes. Near the galaxy's center , left over cosmic debris is steadily being consumed by a central black hole with a billion times the mass of the Sun. As in other active galaxies, that process likely generates the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray energy radiated by Centaurus A . The remarkably deep, visible light image offers further evidence of the ensuing cosmic violence in the faint shells and extended features surrounding the active galaxy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T09:53:13.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
