And now, the Overseas Press Club has agreed.\nOn Tuesday, the OPC announced that Sack is this year’s recipient of its Thomas Nast Award for cartoons — one of several dozen honors and citations bestowed by the group, which rewards courageous and illuminating international coverage.\nby Steve Sack / Minneapolis Star Tribune (Cagle Cartoons) Sack, whose work won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize , says he is “immensely honored” to be recognized by the OPC, even as he emphasizes the role of the press in 2017.\n“Technology may be shrinking our world, but without the work of professional journalists to sort out what’s truly of value, we’d be left with nothing but gibberish, commercial pablum and government spin,” Sack tells The Post’s Comic Riffs. “The press is my window to the world.\n“To have my cartoons recognized by those whose efforts I depend on every day,” he adds, “is most gratifying.”\nby Steve Sack / Minneapolis Star Tribune (Cagle Cartoons) The OPC judges said that “Sack successfully harnessed all the cartoonist’s tools — caricature, composition, biting wit and solid journalism — in his impressive portfolio.”\nThe Overseas Press Club also awarded a finalist citation to Adam Zyglis of the Buffalo News.\n“I was extremely happy to see Steve Sack win the top prize,” says Zyglis, who won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize . “He is a true master of the craft, and is at the top of his game right now. To be a finalist behind someone of his caliber is humbling.”\nby Adam Zyglis / Buffalo News (Cagle Cartoons) [ Pulitzer Prizes: Buffalo News’ Adam Zyglis says cartooning win is ‘surreal’ ]\nElsewhere, the OPC’s President’s Award will salute those who have died covering the Syrian war — one of six honors awarded to those reporting on the conflict. And the Washington Post’s Simon Denyer, Emily Rauhala and Elizabeth Dwoskin won the Bob Considine Award for their series on China “Behind the Firewall.”\nThe winners will be honored April 27 in New York.", "external_links": ["https://opcofamerica.org/overseas-press-club-announces-22-award-winners/", "https://twitter.com/@comicriffs"], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T18:43:52.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
