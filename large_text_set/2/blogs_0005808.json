You have to feel for Joe Hart hereâ€¦ A back-pass gets stuck in a puddle!ðŸŒ§ #SerieA https://t.co/BFgmVpPWob \nâ€” BT Sport Football (@btsportfootball) February 6, 2017 Getty Images 5 Hart was left in disbelief as his teammateâ€™s backpass landed in a puddle \nIn first half stoppage time, the England goalkeeper rushed out to collect a pretty straightforward backpass, only to find it stop in a puddle. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Manchester City news , gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nEmpoli striker Manuel Pucciarelli was then on hand to leave the England goalkeeper high and (not so) dry and roll the ball into the empty net. \nThat goal came after in-demand striker Andrea Belotti put Torino ahead with his shin in the 11th minute. \nThe on-loan Man City goalkeeperâ€™s blushes could have been well and truly spared in the second half when his side were awarded a controversial second half penalty, but Iago Falque saw his spot kick saved. Hart slides into a puddle but canâ€™t prevent an Empoli goal ANSA The Man City loanee received a heroâ€™s welcome at Torino earlier in the season EPA Chelsea target Andrea Belotti had put Torino in front with his shin EPA Iago Falqueâ€™s penalty was saved in Torinoâ€™s 1-1 draw \nHart has had a mixed season in Turin. \nHe has made some fantastic saves, but also conceded 33 goals in 23 games â€“ the highest total for any goalkeeper in Serie Aâ€™s top ten. Joe Hart gets studded in the face playing for Torino but bravely battles on \nAnd he is not expected to move to Torino on a permanent basis, with West Ham preparing to secure his signature for Â£15million in the summer. \nBut Hart may at least afford himself a wry smile when seeing the misfortunes of Man City replacement Claudio Bravo, who is officially the Premier League's worst goalkeeper .
