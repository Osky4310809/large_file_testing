The scene inspired her to pick up some tools and do some family DIY. (Photo: Facebook) \n\"It made me think, 'what if we bought some 2x4s and sheet rock and put that together?'\" she said. \n\"What would our dream house be? Would we want to build it?\" \nCara's children were 17, 15, 11, and 2 back when they began building their dream home together. And it was as much about rebuilding their lives as it was a house. \nThe mum was worried her kids would have \"no self-esteem and no confidence.\" \nShe herself had suffered abusive relationships in her 20s and 30s and has twice been divorced. (Photo: Facebook) \n\"The reality is when you're facing that level of terror, you're all just in survivor mode,\" she told BuzzFeed . \n\"Each one of you is just trying to make it through the day. I worried that if they left home I'd never see them again.\" \nSo Cara built her own family sanctuary. Somewhere she and her children could start again in safety. She bought the tools, the materials, and followed online 'how-to' guides, even laying the foundations, erecting the wooden house frame, and tiling the floors. It took a long while – but they got there. \n\"We were exceptionally naive, but sometimes ignorance takes the place of courage,\" she said. \n\"As we were trying to do this, we were also learning how to communicate.\" \nThe family have been living in Inkwell Manor for eight years. Cara said her kids did benefit from the experience, and that they're \"fearless,\" ready to \"dive into anything.\" \nCara and her family’s journey is fully documented in her new book, Rise, which comes out on January 24.
