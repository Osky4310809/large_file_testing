While posing for photos, Chrissy put some sexy moves on display for her man, who danced behind her for a bit before letting out a laugh. Chrissy clearly had fun during their parents' night out , as evidenced by the hilarious drunk Snapchats she posted after getting home from the award show; in one clip, Chrissy asks John for help taking off her jewelry, cooing, \"Are you mad at me?\" John, the world's perfect husband, lovingly replies, \"Why would I be mad at you? You're perfect.\" \nYeah, we can't with them. Related:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:09:02.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
