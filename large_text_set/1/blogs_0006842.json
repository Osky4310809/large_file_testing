The card was revealed this week when one lucky recipient shared her card on social media.\nWith two young kids, itâ€™s no surprise that this yearâ€™s card is all about William and Kateâ€™s little ones, Prince George and Princess Charlotte ! Held in their parentâ€™s hands, 3-year-old George and 19-month-old Charlotte are transfixed by a clown-like performer in the picture â€” as he makes the pair their own balloon animals.\nItâ€™s a shot from the coupleâ€™s fall visit to Canada â€” the first overseas tour the Royal Fab Four took together.\nA lovely royal surprise arrived today! This photo taken by Arthur Edwards in Victoria, BC was used as The #Cambridges' Christmas / thank you card. Absolutely adore George & Charlotte! ðŸ’‹ #royalmail #postcard #PrinceWilliam #DukeofCambridge #DuchessofCambridge #Kate #PrinceGeorge #PrincessCharlotte #KensingtonPalace #igerslondon #twitter \nA photo posted by V (@ladyandtherose) on Jan 5, 2017 at 3:11pm PST \n\nTheir Canadian vacation wasnâ€™t the only highlight for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their kids. The family enjoyed a surprise snowy vacation in the Alps, Princess Charlotte turned one , and George had a big day out. Oh, and there was also that time George greeted President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama while wearing a monogrammed robe and slippers .\nThe Cambridges didnâ€™t attend the royal familyâ€™s annual Christmas visit to Sandringham in 2016, instead opting to spend the holiday with Kateâ€™s parents in Bucklebury, England.\nThis article originally appeared on People.com . \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T19:00:47.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
