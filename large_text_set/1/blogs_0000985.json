Is nothing sacred anymore? In case you missed the biggest sporting event of the day yesterday, the final for the World Darts Championship was going on. Quite possibly the greatest display of athleticism the world will ever see. Van Gerwen vs Anderson. A match up for the ages pitting two legends of the game against one another. An instant classic in the makings. That is, of course, until a goddamn deranged lunatic decided to run out onto the stage to grab the trophy before Michael van Gerwan had a chance to sink his meaty paws into that bad boy. \nThe PDC should be ashamed of themselves. The biggest stage of the year and I guess their Chief of Security was Michael Floyd because they were asleep at the wheel. And let’s take a closer look at the would-be thief. \nLook at that! Gloves! This wasn’t some idiot who just ended up getting dared to run out onto the stage and steal the trophy. This was clearly a pre-planned attack on the World Darts Championship. Who is behind this? al-Qaeda? ISIS? Liam Neeson’s agent trying to find him a new movie to star in? I guess we’ll never know. For now, let’s just count our lucky stars that the trophy was recovered and returned to the hands of its rightful owner. Michael van Gerwan is about to be SWIMMING in pussy for the next few weeks. \nHe’s about to be hitting a few more bullseyes if you know what I mean…. (we’re talking about sex). \nP.S. – That’s a dick load of people at a darts event. I know it’s the World Championship and everything but still. Crazy that we live in a word where dart throwing brings out more fans than the New York Islanders get at any home game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T16:48:39.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
