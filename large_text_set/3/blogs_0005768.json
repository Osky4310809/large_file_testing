If it's been in contact with air for too long or has a tainted cork, the liquid inside has turned and should not be consumed. Here are a handful of telltale signs that might indicate a good wine has gone bad. The smell is off. If a wine's aroma is moldy or resembles a musty basement, wet cardboard, or vinegar, it's turned. A heavy raisin smell is another bad signal. The red wine tastes sweet. If the bottle of red wine has the aroma of Port or tastes like dessert wine (even though it is neither of those two things), it has been overexposed to heat, and is therefore undrinkable. The cork is pushed out slightly from the bottle. That's a sign the wine has overheated and expanded within the bottle. The wine is a brownish color. A brown hue in red wine demonstrates that the liquid is past its prime. White wines that have darkened to a deep yellow or brownish straw color are usually oxidized. You detect astringent or chemically flavors. Wine that lacks fruit, is raspy, too astringent, or has a paint-thinner taste is usually bad. It tastes fizzy, but it's not a sparkling wine. A still wine that is fizzy or effervescent has undergone a second fermentation after the bottling and shouldn't be enjoyed. \nOne last word of advice: Always smell and examine the actual liquid. Although the term \"corked\" commonly refers to tainted wine, inspecting the cork alone will not determine if the wine has gone bad. Use your other senses. Have you ever had an undrinkable bottle of wine? How did you know it was questionable? Image Source: POPSUGAR Photography / Anna Monette Roberts Around The Web What’s Your Reaction?

When you say don't drink it, is it only because it will taste bad or will it harm you? LynnieB 3 years There is a dirty little secret in the wine industry. Up to 10% of some lots of wine are damaged by bad corks, bad storage conditions, etc. Always take a bad bottle back to the store where you bought it. Any reputable dealer will take it back and replace the bottle or give your money back. They can turn it back to the distributor. In a restaurant, if you're not sure, ask the waiter to have it tasted by their wine expert, but don't expect them to take it back just because you don't like the wine. Some people are much more sensitive to some of the \"corked\" flavors than others. I will sometimes drink a wine that has a slight mustiness without it diminishing the flavors for me, but my wife is much more unpleasantly sensitive to the slightest corked elements than I am. testadura67 4 years I like that a wine that \"has a paint-thinner taste is usually bad\". Whether it's turned or not, if your wine tastes like paint thinner, I'm gonna go ahead say don't drink it, haha! Good tips though, thanks for the info! doolan 5 years I bought 6 bottles of wine when my son was a baby for his 21st which was last night..we opened one and it was just very ordinary with a bad aftertaste and no-one could finish their glass..hard to explain..not fizzy just yuk...Henske so worth $165 now...wanted to sell the other 5 but would just hate to rip someone off..so hard to judge wine xxx SeptemberLights 8 years There is a difference between wine cheap wine and wine that has gone bad- Ive had plenty of cheap wines that were very drinkable-and plenty that were 'fizzy' and they were meant to be. If you taste wine that has gone bad you will know! You will probably gag when you smell or taste it. Its just like drinking bad milk. You will know when its gone bad...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T21:41:44.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
