Using open sources (because the Obama administration refused to provide government records), the report found that 380 out of 580 people convicted in terror cases since 9/11 were foreign-born. The report is no longer available on the Senate website, but a summary published by Fox News is available here .\nThe Center has obtained a copy of the information compiled by the subcommittee . The information compiled includes names of offenders, dates of conviction, terror group affiliation, federal criminal charges, sentence imposed, state of residence, and immigration history.\nThe Center has extracted information on 72 individuals named in the Senate report whose country of origin is one of the seven terror-associated countries included in the vetting executive order: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Senate researchers were not able to obtain complete information on each convicted terrorist, so it is possible that more of the convicted terrorists are from these countries.\nThe United States has admitted terrorists from all of the seven dangerous countries:\nSomalia: 20\nYemen: 19\nIraq: 19\nSyria: 7\nIran: 4\nLibya: 2\nSudan: 1\nTotal: 72\nAccording to the report, at least 17 individuals entered as refugees from these terror-prone countries. Three came in on student visas and one arrived on a diplomatic visa.\nAt least 25 of these immigrants eventually became citizens. Ten were lawful permanent residents, and four were illegal aliens.\nThese immigrant terrorists lived in at least 16 different states, with the largest number from the terror-associated countries living in New York (10), Minnesota (8), California (8), and Michigan (6). Ironically, Minnesota was one of the states suing to block Trump's order to pause entries from the terror-associated countries, claiming it harmed the state. At least two of the terrorists were living in Washington, which joined with Minnesota in the lawsuit to block the order.\nThirty-three of the 72 individuals from the seven terror-associated countries were convicted of very serious terror-related crimes, and were sentenced to at least three years imprisonment. The crimes included use of a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit a terror act, material support of a terrorist or terror group, international money laundering conspiracy, possession of explosives or missiles, and unlawful possession of a machine gun.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/11/study-72-convicted-terrorists-who-lived-in-us-came-from-countries-covered-by-vetting-order/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/06/22/anatomy-terror-threat-files-show-hundreds-us-plots-refugee-connection.html?intcmp=hplnws", "http://cis.org/vaughan/study-reveals-72-terrorists-came-countries-covered-trump-vetting-order", "http://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/Copy-of-terrorists-from-7-danger-countries-charges-added-2.xls", "http://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/Terror%20Arrests.senate%20judiciary.pdf"], "published": "2017-02-11T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:21:31.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
