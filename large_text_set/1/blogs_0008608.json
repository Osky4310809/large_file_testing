He said Mr. Modi wasn’t even this popular in 2014, the year in which the BJP won by a landslide in elections for Parliament’s lower house.\nWinning this spring’s state contests would help the BJP increase its presence in the legislature’s upper house, where opposition parties have blocked some of Mr. Modi’s proposals. The polls are also the first major test of Mr. Modi’s popularity since the currency nullification, which left many Indians scrambling for cash for weeks. Results are due March 11.\nAmong the five states that will elect new governments starting in February is Uttar Pradesh, home to one in six Indians. There the BJP is gearing up for a tough fight against three rival parties, including two regional players that have long held power. Mr. Modi’s party hasn’t ruled the state in 15 years. It won a vast majority of the state’s parliamentary constituencies in the 2014 national election, though.\nIn the neighboring state of Bihar, the BJP in 2015 lost the assembly election to a coalition of regional rivals despite dozens of rallies addressed by the prime minister.\nIndia Today, a news organization, said this month that a survey it commissioned predicted a BJP majority in Uttar Pradesh. Opinion polls in India have a spotty record at predicting election outcomes, though.\nFor breaking news, features and analysis from India, follow WSJ India on Facebook .\nShare this: Bharatiya Janata Party India narendra modi Piyush Goyal power minister State Elections Uttar Pradesh Previous Rights Groups Ask Pakistan to Probe Disappearance of Activists", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T07:45:33.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
