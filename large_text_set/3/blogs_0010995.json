This, in turn, should have a considerable impact on a laptop's battery life, though Google doesn't state exactly how big. \nThe change will not affect tabs playing audio or maintaining real-time connections such as WebSockets and WebRTC. \nA technical explanation, aimed at developers, of how the new Chrome handles background tabs is available here . \nGoogle says the long-term goal is for background tabs to be fully suspended, with services that need to do stuff in the background relying on new APIs, but we're not quite there yet. In the meantime, Google will do what it can to make Chrome suck on that battery a little slower. \nChrome 57 is available for download now. If you already have it, it likely auto-updated to the last available version already. \nWATCH: Uncovering Tor: The deep web's browser of choice", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T12:28:57.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
