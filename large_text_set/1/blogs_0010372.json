Decked in designer finery, the all-too-familiar faces have religiously turned up for the 62nd Jio Filmfare Awards show, which is currently underway, in Mumbai. Since the Filmfare awards are considered the Indian equivalent of the Oscars, the actresses brought out their meticulously-sourced couture (thanks to a stylist-led entourage) for a night replete with legends and to-be-legends. Here’s looking at all the fabulously dressed ladies from the night! \n1. Thinking woman’s actress Kalki Koechlin decided to participate in a little pun and dressed like an Oscar trophy at the event.
