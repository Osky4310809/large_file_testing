Food writer and TV chef Delia Smith Credit: David Hartley / Rex Features \n\"I always feel that Delia, who I think is absolutely brilliant, hasn't had the advantage of having children like I have because you don't half get the truth,\" she said at an event in London called An Evening with Mary Berry. \n\"I get the truth from my husband too, and sometimes I get really hurt\". \nM s Smith, 75, who is married to the writer Michael Wynn-Jones, has said in the past that she would have \"loved\" to have children. But the chef suggested that being childless may have advanced her career. \nIn an interview with Yours magazine in 2011 she said: \"It wasn't to be, but I have loved what I've been able to do by not having children. \n\"Maybe one of the reasons I've been so successful in my career is down to the fact I haven't had any children.\" \nMs Berry was also asked about her successor on the Great British Bake Off , Prue Leith, who has joined the show for its move to Channel 4.

I think shw will be incredibly different but I think she will do really well. \n\"For me, it's very nice that they have chosen someone who has the knowledge and who will enjoy it. I think she will be very, very good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T10:37:52.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
