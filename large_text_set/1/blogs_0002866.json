The PM announced schemes and measures for the poor, farmers, small traders, women and senior citizens that seemed a precursor to the Budget -and a likely campaign theme in assembly polls in UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa -indicating a mix of populism and growth pills.\nA day after the deadline for depositing old 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, PM Modi called the demonetization a purification drive during his Saturday speech.

Law will deal with them strictly.“\nModi described demonetisation as a “historic shuddhi yagna“ that will set the country’s direction in coming years. He said people had sup ported demonetisation despite having to stand in lines for hours to withdraw their own money because they wanted to escape the stifling effect of distortions and ills caused by corruption, black money and fake notes.\nModi elaborated on his previous post-demonetisation speeches, saying the gains from demonetisation, in terms of money that has become part of the formal economy , would be used to benefit the poor and small tradesmen who find it hard to access credit. He said it will be his priority to find ways and means to reward honest citizens while there will be tough action against the unscrupulous. “It is clear that the roads are closed for dishonest people trying to find cunning ways to beat the system,“ he said, adding that he welcomed those joining the mainstream.\nThe PM said more measures will come to nab tax evaders and black money hoarders with the “power of technology“ forcing the “habitually dishonest“ to change their behaviour.\nHe spoke of how the country had united against exter nal aggression in wars, but said it was all the more remarkable when people got together to combat an enemy within. “Sociologists and historians in coming days will discuss how people summoned a similar resolve to fight weaknesses and maladies within. Usually , whenever there is a campaign for something noble, government and people are arrayed on opposite sides. This was a unique instance of regime and people partnering each other in the fight for the good,“ he said.\nHe acknowledged that the scarcity of cash in an economy was problematic but said the domination of cash could lead to far more serious trouble, referring to the parallel economy that is inflationary and relies on black money. – TNN\nNashik mint sends 51m notes to RBI in 24hrs\nThe Currency Note Press (CNP) in Nashik sent its biggest consignment of currency notes to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on New Year’s Eve.
