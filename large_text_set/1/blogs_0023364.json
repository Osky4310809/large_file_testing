As one of seven parcels that comprise the Taylor Yard, a 247-acre former freight switching facility owned by Union Pacific Railroad, the soil is contaminated and will have to be cleaned up—a project that could take several years.\nBut once finished, “It will create much-needed public open space in the middle of the city, provide extensive habitat restoration, and serve as a key access point for local communities to connect to the river,” Garcetti said in a statement.\nLos Angeles City Councilman Mitch O’Farrell said in the Los Angeles Times that, “In order to do anything along the river, we must control the property.”\nG2 will connect Rio de Los Angeles State Park with the Bowtie parcel, which is also owned by the state. That opens up more than one mile of direct riverfront access, said Tony Arranaga, a spokesman for O’Farrell.\nIt’s the lynchpin for Alternative 20 , the ambitious plan to restore 11 miles of the river from Griffith Park to Downtown, said Marissa Christiansen, senior policy director of Friends of Los Angeles River, which has pushed for the city to buy the land. \n“This is the first step in making that vision a reality,” she said.\nThe city has 30 days to close escrow.\nLA Getting $25 Million from California to Buy 40-Acre Parcel Along the River [Curbed LA] A whopping new, $252M price tag for LA River's 'crown jewel' [Curbed LA] 11-Mile Makeover of the LA River is Moving Right Along [Curbed LA] Aerial photos show off the strange beauty of the LA River [Curbed LA] 25 Photos of the Los Angeles River Before It Was Paved [Curbed LA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T02:47:59.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
