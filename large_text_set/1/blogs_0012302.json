By Angela Fritz January 12 at 1:49 PM Follow @angelafritz (Kevin Wolf/Flickr) \nA very cold high-pressure system will set the stage for wintry weather Saturday. Even though precipitation will be light, freezing rain seems likely in some parts of the D.C. region, and it doesn’t take much of it to coat roads in dangerous ice. \nTemperatures are likely to drop below freezing, while at the same time road temperatures may still be warm from Thursday’s “heat wave,” which makes the forecast difficult. But the bottom line is that this pattern is similar to what we saw Dec. 17, so we’re urging drivers to carefully evaluate road conditions before heading out Saturday. \nCapital Weather Gang Winter Storm Impact Scale : Level 1 — Nuisance \nThis will be a relatively long-duration event and, at least in the northern suburbs, temperatures should be sufficiently cold to create slick roads. But it does not merit a higher rating because most precipitation is expected to be light and because temperatures before and after the storm are unlikely to be cold enough to solidify any iciness. \nTiming: Precipitation seems likely to begin Saturday morning. It will probably last into at least the midafternoon Saturday, and some models suggest that it will end as late as late Sunday morning. \nHazards: Light accumulating snow, sleet or freezing rain are likely, but amounts are still in question. \nImpacts: Icy roads, especially in our colder areas to the north, on bridges and on surfaces that have not been treated with salt. Power outages are unlikely because we’re not expecting enough ice accumulation to bring down branches. \nThis weather setup is called “cold-air damming,” when freezing temperatures flow south into the D.C. region and are trapped here, or dammed, by the mountains to the west. When rain falls into the freezing air near the ground, it can flash-freeze on surfaces — that is freezing rain. \nForecast models tend not to handle cold-air-damming situations that well. The global models that we rely on for major winter storms — the GFS and Euro — tend to warm things too quickly. But the NAM has proved its worth in previous cases like this by allowing temperatures to remain cold for longer, which has ended up delivering a better forecast. \nAt this point, frozen precipitation seems likely in parts of the D.C. region Saturday morning, perhaps through that evening. The steadiest precipitation is likely during the morning hours, and it may be a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. During the afternoon, it probably becomes mostly freezing rain, but may be quite light and spotty. \nThe north and west suburbs (Frederick, Loudoun, northern Montgomery and northern Fauquier counties) have the highest chance of icy roads, even if they are pre-treated. The southern suburbs have the lowest chance, and the Beltway falls in a gray area between the two. \nThe National Weather Service created two great maps today, one for ice and one for snow. The amounts are not high, but again — freezing rain is dangerous at any accumulation. (National Weather Service) \nOur two main uncertainties are the amount of precipitation and the road temperatures. \nIt looks as if precipitation amounts will be light — less than a quarter-inch in most places — though the GFS model is much wetter than the NAM and the Euro. You can see the stark difference in the comparison below. \nRoad temperatures will be the critical determining factor Saturday. As we mentioned earlier, we are starting from a much warmer place than when the December ice storm struck. Temperatures on Thursday are in the 60s, and the sun is shining. Roads will soak up that warmth and hang on to it. Things cool down Friday, but it’s not until Friday night that we hit the freezing mark again. \nWill roads stay warm enough to mitigate ice accumulation? It may come down to location — the Beltway roads may be warm enough, while the cooler suburbs hit the freezing mark. Total liquid precipitation forecast by the NAM (left) and the GFS (right). These forecasts (Capital Weather Gang) \nFinally, we have to mention the fact that the European model keeps the wintry mix around through Sunday morning. In that scenario, Saturday night would be risky for travel, especially in the northern suburbs. This seems unlikely, though we have to consider the possibility. We hope we’ll have more confidence on the storm’s end time in Friday’s update. \nFreezing rain is the most dangerous wintry weather. To understand the potential effect, we need to look back only a few weeks to Dec. 17, when four people died and Interstate 95 was utterly impassable near Baltimore, even though the roads were pre-treated. Part of the reason December’s ice storm was so bad was because temperatures stayed below freezing longer than expected. That’s a risk we also run this Saturday. \nThe Capital Weather Gang’s Jason Samenow contributed to this forecast. 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T00:20:30.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
