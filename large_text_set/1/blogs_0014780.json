Anyone can wear anything, even if that offends the high guards of fashion. There isn’t one standardized process to how fashion operates in the minds of different individuals. That everyone is unique isn’t a textbook phrase. It’s the reality. You aren’t too fat, or skinny, or stocky, or lanky, or whatever new words are coined for our flaws. We encourage you to pick whatever the hell you want. Wear it in the face of blatant body-policing, and crush these rules, one mistake at a time. 1.Dump the “dress for your body” diktat \nThe shape of a fruit does not get to govern the length of your skirt. Own your thick thighs in short-lengths, slender frame in bodycons, and big hips in fitted skirts. Whatever you feel deserves a place on your body should be worn, sans fear of the overrated faux-pas. Eat an apple or a pear, while you are at it. ModCloth Body Positive Swim Campaign 2.Liberate the waist \nThe Victorians cinched the woman’s waist till she lost all her spirit. It’s 2017 and the size of your waist is no benchmark of your femininity. Flaunt it all you want, but take a break when you need to breathe. Pick a roomy sweatshirt or a boxy top while you are at it. 3.Let stripes run however \nOf all the allegations made about stripes, there is one truth that needs acceptance – stripes make you look bloody good. Not a single damn should be given while sporting stripes, both horizontally and vertically. 4.Abandon breast illusions \nThere is more to life than justifying your endowment, in everything you wear. Flat-chested needn’t wear ruffles to pose, as wannabe-C cups and E cups aren’t the sole flag bearers of cleavage-baring merchandise. Own your twins in the fabric/neckline/fit/shape of your choice. 5.Don’t dress like a girl \nDo rise above problematic conditioning to set a personal standard for dressing up. Your skirt is never too short. Dressing like a lady is a laughable, hard-wired concept, and choosing to step beyond your gender, in a menswear suit can be the new-normal. Embrace your personal qualities, and not the ones bequeathed to you by your assigned gender.
