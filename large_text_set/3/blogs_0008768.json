Could   \nShock new claims have emerged over the death of rapper Tupac Shakur - almost 21 years after he was gunned down. \nThe star was fatally wounded following a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas on 7 September 1996, and died in hospital five days later. \nThere were rumours Tupac's murder had been caused by fellow rapper and rival Notorious B.I.G, but his death remains unsolved, with countless conspiracy theories surrounding his death, including claims he's actually alive and well, living with an aunt in Cuba. Tupac was 'murdered by law enforcement', according to new claims (Photo: REUTERS) The rapper was fatally shot in 1996, aged just 25 (Photo: Getty) \nBut allegations in a new book claim Tupac was actually killed by law enforcement. Tupac was shot four times in the chest, arm and thigh after attending a Mike Tyson boxing match. \nWriting in Drugs As Weapons Against Us, author John Potash lifts the lid on claims Tupac was a target because he was politicising black street gangs in the US. \nThe book claims that American intelligence agencies were worried about gangs with a more political outlook, and saw Tupac at the forefront of the movement.
