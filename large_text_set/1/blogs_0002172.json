The information arrives from The Investor , which claims that Samsung Electronics is seeking the SDI department’s services despite previously suspecting its batteries were responsible for the Galaxy Note 7’s overheating issue.\nSamsung is said to have lost billions of dollars on the cancelled Galaxy Note 7 last year, following reports of it catching fire. After initially recalling the handset and replacing the batteries with an alternative from Chinese battery firm ATL, the phones continued to malfunction, leading Samsung to permanently cease production of the device.\nSamsung is expected to reveal the cause of the problem this month, but it would appear that the SDI batteries were not chiefly responsible — if responsible at all — for the Galaxy Note 7 catching fire.\nSee also: Battery maker Samsung SDI wants to make safety a priority 1 day ago Meanwhile, Samsung is said to be readying 10 million Galaxy S8 units as it prepares for its April launch. The report arrives from Korean site Etnews which claims that initial parts will arrive at Samsung factories in February, with mass production beginning in March.\nSamsung sold 10 million units of its Galaxy S7 in the first month, indicating that the Korean manufacturer could be similarly confident about the sales of its upcoming handset.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T15:51:46.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
