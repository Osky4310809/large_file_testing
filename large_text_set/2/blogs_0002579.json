Chocolate, in short, is always there for us. A quick chocolate cake for a birthday elevates the day to something special, and chocolate cookies for a bake sale will always sell out. Chocolate will never get boring. \nIf you, like me, are always looking for the next chocolate recipe that will bring you to dessert heaven, then you're in luck. I asked 10 awesome bloggers to share the most popular chocolate recipes on their sites. You need to put these cookies, cupcakes, tarts, and cakes on your \"must make\" list. 1. Candy Heart Cupcakes from Hummingbird High \nSending your friends and lovers a Valentine's Day card is a nice thought, but do you know what's even better? Chocolate. Specifically, chocolate cupcakes with adorable candy hearts. Also, Hummingbird High describes the frosting on these cupcakes as a \"light and satiny cloud of icing,\" which sounds so romantic. 2. The Baked Brownie from Brown Eyed Baker \nEveryone needs a delicious brownie recipe that they can pull out of their pocket at any time and will always be impressive. This brownie is rich and dense instead of cakey, and it will always deliver. 3. Swedish Chocolate Cake from Call Me Cupcake \nThis delicious chocolate cake — called kladdkaka — looks super fancy, but it's actually pretty easy to make. The secret is in the vanilla and the strong coffee. It sounds wonderful served cold with a dollop of whipped cream. 4. Salted Caramel and Nutella Stuffed Double Chocolate Cookies from Top With Cinnamon \nExcuse me, but did you read the title of this recipe? It has everything you'd ever want in a chocolate recipe and more. There's chocolate and Nutella and salted caramel all in one gorgeous baked good. What else do you want? 5. Peanut Butter Chocolate Lava Cake from Sally's Baking Addiction \nIf you've ever been on Pinterest, then you've seen recipes from Sally's Baking Addiction. No, I'm serious! Her stuff is everywhere, and it's not hard to figure out why. This luscious lava cake is a perfect place to start if you have yet to make one of her creations. 6. Classic Chocolate Tart from Style Sweet CA \nTessa from Style Sweet CA was our fearless leader for Kitchn's Baking School a couple years ago. She knows her stuff. This classic chocolate tart will wow the socks off of anyone who should be so lucky to eat it. 7. French Silk Pie from Dessert with Benefits \nI really can't even begin to describe my deep, deep love for French silk pie. This short-cut version uses store-bought pie crust so you can have this pie more often. 8. Chocolate Gingersnap Tart from Pastry Affair \nThis tart feels like a small gift during the winter months. Try to use the best ingredients that you can afford — it's worth the extra cash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:00:10.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
