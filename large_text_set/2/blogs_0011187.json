I understand their angst. I too struggle to make the best decisions with my personal funds (This is why I hired a financial planner for myself!). For that reason, I decided to put together a list of 25 of some the most interesting investing statistics I think you must know before diving in. \nJust about every day we hear how bad finances are in this country. Unfortunately, we tend to be apathetic and just to accept those statistics. So it's important to learn all we can about finances to drown out the excess noise. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some tend to discredit stats altogether. Be Careful, both of these approaches are costly! Don't make the mistake of not learning from the mistakes of others. Before we start any investment, it's crucial to get acquainted with the market. Hopefully, that will give us the power to avoid common investing mistakes. 25 Investing Statistics If you do not start saving until 45, you will need to save three times as much as if you start at 25.
