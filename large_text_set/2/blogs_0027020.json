Last night, the franchise scored a major win thanks to Suicide Squad ; The blockbuster won an award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and the Internet had lots to say about the development. Now, photos from the Oscars are surfacing online, and Suicide Squad fans were quick to learn the event hosted a display based on the film. At the exhibit, a slew of behind-the-scenes photos were shared, and several of them hint at one of the Joker ’s deleted scenes. \nIf you look at the images, two photos of the Joker stand out amongst the rest. In one, the villain can be seen wearing his fitted tuxedo and slick-back green hair. However, his expression is made more two-faced thanks to the massive burn on his cheek. Similar images were briefly shown in trailers for Suicide Squad , but the scene was cut. The shot was meant to have taken placed after the Joker is involved in a helicopter crash trying to get Harley Quinn back from her task force imprisonment. \nThe exhibit also shows a plethora of concept artwork. Test prostheses for Killer Croc can be seen while various accessories worn by Harley are also littered about. There are also close-up images of the makeup used to bring the Enchantress to life, and her cracked skin looks gruesome up close. \nYou can check out images of the exhibit in the following slides! \nAssemble a team of the world’s most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government’s disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren’t picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it’s every man for himself? \nSuicide Squad: The Extended Cut is now available on Digital HD, Blu-ray, and DVD.
