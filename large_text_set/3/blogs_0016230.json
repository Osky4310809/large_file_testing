It has been praised by pro-life outlets and dismissed by pro-choice outlets . \nThe director, Punam Kumar Gill, who is pro-choice, decided to make the film in order to investigate controversies surrounding abortion’s long-term effects on women. She also investigated the health issues related to her own late-term miscarriage. \nJoses Martin, producer of “Hush,” said in a statement that “this is not a political film.” \n“It’s a women’s health film that is packed with important information about breast cancer, premature birth, miscarriage, pregnancy and abortion, that every audience member will learn something from,” Martin said. “But it does come out with some very controversial findings that refute supposedly conclusive statements made by international health organizations.” \nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, said in a statement that “the film is specifically about opening up a healthy conversation on women’s reproductive health and providing correct information that women are entitled to have if they are considering abortion.” \n“It’s being screened at colleges and universities because it’s these women who are the largest demographic who may be suffering from complications from abortions and it’s at these educational institutions that thoughtful and fair consideration in the pursuit of truth is still king,” Hawkins said. \nOne of the schools at which the film will be screened is Brown University. \nAnya Hong, president of Brown University Students for Life, said in a statement that “I think this screening will present a much-needed opportunity to foster discussion about abortion and women’s health, while enabling viewers to recognize that the political rhetoric [on both sides] obscures important information.” \n“Students at Brown are intellectually curious and the film’s slogan of ‘pro-information’ has the potential to appeal to many of the students on campus,” Hong said. “Our goal in providing a screening of the movie is to clear the politics surrounding the issue and to allow everyone on our campus to work towards a common goal – providing pro-woman, pro-health, and pro-human resources.” \nHawkins added, “We see this as an opportunity on campuses for respectful and productive discourse for the sake of women’s health, not a screaming match over abortion.” \n“We are hoping that these serious side effects to abortion will be given the attention that they demand by the mainstream media in a true service and honor to women,” she said. \nAccording to Students for Life, in addition to Brown, other universities that will screen the film include Dartmouth College, Yale University, Boston College, Georgetown University and Penn State University.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T16:30:25.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
