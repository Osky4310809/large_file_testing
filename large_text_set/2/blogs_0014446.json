These items are currently beating fragrances by Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears, Vera Wang and Giorgio Armani. \nThe success of the perfume could suggest a resistance to boycotts against any products associated the Trump family, according to Fortune . \nThose who want to hurt the Trumps with boycotts are learning that buyers have several options when it comes to purchasing products they want. Retailers might make Ivanka merchandise unavailable in their stores or on their websites to make a political point, but buyers have no obligation to remain loyal to them.   \nThey can always turn to other outlets, such as Amazon, to get what they want — and it looks like that is exactly what they are doing. \nBy the way sales are taking off on Amazon, dropping Ivanka’s merchandise might be a financial mistake. \nLiberals everywhere who have worked hard to destroy anything related to the Trump name must be livid when they realize that this movement has basically backfired.
