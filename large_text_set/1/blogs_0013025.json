Julien De Sart and Pablo Hernandez battle for the ball (Photo: PA) \nBartley had a real head in hands moment on 25 minutes when he somehow poked Hernandez’s corner wide of the post from only a yard out but Leeds’s pressure was eventually rewarded on the stroke of half-time when Wood headed home from another excellent Hernandez corner. \nThe visitors hardly threatened Robert Green in the home goal during the first 45 minutes but the former England keeper was called into action with the last kick of the half when he tipped Tom Ince’s rasping drive over the bar. \nDerby boss Steve McClaren rang the changes at half-time and brought on Will Hughes and Matej Vydra and it sparked the visitors into life, albeit briefly.
