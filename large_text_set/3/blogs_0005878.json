His widow, Carryn, received the longest standing ovation during Trump’s joint address to Congress last night—and rightfully so. \nThis is what Trump said: We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero –- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. \nI just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him. \"He became President of the United States in that moment. Period.\" @VanJones68 on Trump honoring a Navy SEAL's widow https://t.co/NrIBVZvgRT — CNN (@CNN) March 1, 2017 \nJones said that in this moment, Donald Trump became the president of the United States. He also said that it was “one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics. Period.” \nHe added that for people who were hoping that Trump would be a unifying force and presidential, they should be happy. Jones also warned that for those who thought Trump would just be a bull in a china closet, they should be worried because if he manages to keep finding these emotional moments, he’ll win a second term. \n“For people who have been hoping that maybe he would remain a divisive cartoon, which he often finds a way to do, they should begin to become a little bit worried tonight. Because that thing you just saw him do—if he finds a way to do that over and over again, he’s going to be there for eight years,” he said. \nJones concluded by saying that the speech was full of things he opposed, but you cannot take away this moment; he became the president. And this is coming from a commentator who said 2016 was a \"whitelash \" (it wasn't). Van can be grating at times, but he's known for calling out his own side as well . \nOf course, not everyone agreed. And the Hollywood Left should probably be included in factors that could give Trump a second term as well. \"It was cringe-worthy ... talk about using someone as a prop. It was disgraceful.\" @robreiner on Ryan Owens's widow #JointAddress #Hardball", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:16:30.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
