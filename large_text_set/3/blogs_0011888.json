Rosenberg Arrow icon \nATLANTIC CITY - A local development group says it has a contract to purchase the old Atlantic Club casino hotel and will build a \"world class\" indoor water park. \nThe announcement by Ventnor-based R&R Development Group, which previously floated fanciful plans for a monorail-accessed Bader Field development , revives a water-park idea that fell through for another company. \nThe Atlantic Club, formerly the Atlantic City Hilton and, before that, Steve Wynn's Golden Nugget, was the first of five casinos to close here, beginning in January 2014. \n[Related: Read my weekend story about how Atlantic City, in the throes of a state takeover, i s being run by a West Orange, N.J., law firm , and who's really cashing in on the controversial takeover. ] \nBut recently, some of the shuttered casinos have begun to show a little life. Showboat is operating as a Bart Blatstein-owned non-casino hotel. The Taj Mahal was sold to Hard Rock International and two New Jersey developers. \nThe Atlantic Club, near Albany Avenue and the site of a future campus of Stockton University and South Jersey Industries, had languished at the southern end of the Boardwalk as a series of proposals fell through. \nWith eccentric owner Glenn Straub and his shuttered Revel at the other end of the Boardwalk hogging the spotlight, Atlantic Club just sat there, its inactivity mostly under the radar. \nStockton president Harvey Kesselman has expressed interest in the parking garage at Atlantic Club. \nBut R&R Development, in a news release, said it planned a water park \"designed by the leading U.S. developers of water parks,\" plus a large-scale family entertainment center, \"designed by the leading U.S. developer of family-entertainment facilities.\" \nThe group also plans to refurbish the hotel complex itself to \"restore it to its original glory, when it was the leading hotel property in Atlantic City,\" complete with \"important restaurants and entertainment events year-round.\" \n\"It will once again be a 'must-see' property, something that the city sorely needs at this time,\" the release said. \nAccording to previous reports, R&R is comprised of Robert Reilert, a former casino executive, and Ronny Young, a Philadelphia-based investor with a home in Ventnor. \nMayor Don Guardian issued a statement Monday saying the Atlantic Club's location and the deal's timing are better than the prior Bader Field idea. \n“I met with Ronny Young more than a year ago, as he brought investors together for a possible major waterpark and hotel facility at Bader Field,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, that deal did not consummate at the time. However, I believe that this new location and timing are much better to assure success. Mr. Young and his investors have a world-class indoor waterpark design that will be a great use for the Atlantic Club. I spoke with Ronny Young this morning to congratulate him on closing the deal and assured him that my administration will continue to work with him to help bring back more jobs and ratables to Atlantic City for Atlantic City residents.” Read more by Amy S.
