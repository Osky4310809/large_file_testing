Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA young woman who thought it was her lucky day when she found £20 on the floor has spoken of how her life has been 'turned upside down'. \nNicole Bailey was caught on CCTV pocketing the note in the One Stop store, in Blurton, Staffordshire, which had been dropped by a fellow customer. \nThe 23-year-old initially denied taking the money but went on to plead guilty to theft after being shown the footage. \nNow Nicole has spoken of the series of events which led to her ending up with a criminal record and how she fears she may yet lose her job. \nShe told the Stoke Sentinel she went to Longton Police Station last November three months after the incident when officers visited her mother's address. Nicole Bailey found the money at a One Stop shop (Photo: Google) Read More Social experiment filmed £20 notes being dropped near Londoners - and here's what happened \nNicole, of Blurton, added: \"I attended voluntarily and without legal representation and was interviewed. At the time I had no recollection of finding the money. \n\"I was asked to go back to the police station to 'sort it out' and again I was not represented by a solicitor as I didn't think I had done anything wrong. On this occasion I was shown CCTV and accepted that it was me on the CCTV. \n\"In January I received a postal requisition to attend court. It was only then that I realised that I needed legal advice. \n\"When I discussed the case with a solicitor it became apparent that because I had not attempted to make any checks as to who may have lost the £20 I was potentially guilty of theft. \n\"I am currently in work and not eligible for Legal Aid to fight the case. \n\"Faced with the possibility of paying legal fees to defend the matter or accepting the offence and having the matter dealt with at the first hearing, I chose the latter.\" \nSince Nicole's court case, there has been an outpouring of sympathy from readers who admit they would have done the same thing in that situation. \nNicole – who has no previous convictions – added: \"The whole process has been very upsetting and I wanted it put behind me as soon as possible. I never imagined that there would be so much interest in the case. \n\"The media attention has now put my job in jeopardy and turned my life upside down. I really wish I could turn back time. \n\"I wish that I had been represented at the police station as I probably would not have ended up in this mess.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:11:37.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
