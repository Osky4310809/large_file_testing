Someone keeps stealing it. \nThe stores are no longer featuring beef steaks on their shelves in an effort to stop rampant shoplifting of their priciest cuts of meat. \nAn initial poster blamed \"deviants\" for the the theft, but has since been taken down. \"We apologise for any inconvenience this causes our honest customers,\" says one sign. \nThe empty shelf-space has since been replaced with placards requesting customers to inquire with a staff member if they are interested in purchasing a steak. \nSpeaking anonymously with local publication Cornwall Live, shop employees admitted that the meat theft was occurring so frequently that at times there was rarely any left for paying customers. \nREAD MORE: Don't Leave Your Unwanted Meat in the Detergent Aisle at the Grocery Store, You Monsters \nSome have pointed the finger at local police for not caring about the repeated, small-time theft. Meanwhile, authorities have questioned whether the stores were making enough effort in terms of security in order to curb the the problem. \nOne thing is for certain: with all this fancy meat being stolen, we know it's not the Hamburgler. He's already filling up on dollar burgers at the Golden Arches, and he definitely can't run very fast at this point in his career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T01:17:54.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
