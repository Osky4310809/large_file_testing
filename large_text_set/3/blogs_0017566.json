I most especially love Thor , The Flash, Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man… sookay, my list may be endless after all but for this article we chose three videos to show you how select actors prepare for their superhero roles starting with Thor. \n1. Long-haired and blue eyed God of Thunder, Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth who also happened to have a sexy voice. I’d always thought he was gorgeous but then when he growled out this line to Loki in The Avengers (2012, Joss Whedon): So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? I was completely sold out after that. Because. Sexy. \nThese days his workout video is breaking the Internet, it’s no surprise though. I mean, just look at him go at it. \n2. Dwayne Johnson who is reportedly set to play Doc Savage and Black Adam in Shazam. Ripped, handsome, big, masculine with an amiable grin—these are the words that first came to my head when thinking about “The Rock.” And his workout regime? Hardcore. I get tired just by watching him. \n3. Big, badass, long-haired Jason Momoa who’s got an intense, piercing stare. He actually has a gorgeous smile which is probably not easily noticed because of his intimidating demeanor. He is best-known as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones but these days you watch him in the silver screen as Aquaman . \nWhat about you guys? Who are your favorite superheroes? Which superhero workout video(s) did you like? Share your thoughts with us in the comments section below. \nHappy viewing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T21:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T21:03:11.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
