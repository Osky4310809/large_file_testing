Len McCluskey accuses Tom Watson of acting in a 'low-budget Godfather' \nIt follows a furious row between deputy leader Tom Watson and Mr Corbyn’s biggest union backer Len McCluskey over an alleged left-wing plot to cement control of the party. \nMr Livingstone, himself currently suspended from the party over allegedly anti-Semitic statements, said: “Those that have been most over the top I think should be suspended. \n“I think the other thing that Jeremy should do is re-introduce automatic re-selection. It's really ridiculous that MPs in safe seats have a job for life. I'm particularly talking about Chuka Umunna, Wes Streeting - basically it's the same group of MPs who were screaming that I'd said Hitler was a Zionist and I was anti-Semitic. \n“The moment that issue went on hold, they were then blaming Jeremy for Britain voting to leave (the EU). Just endless criticism. It's only about a dozen of them. The simple fact is they are consciously undermining Jeremy and damaging the Labour Party.” Philip Hammond jokes that Jeremy Corbyn is so far down a black hole that 'even Stephen Hawking has disowned him' \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 live days after Mr Corbyn issued a plea for party unity, Mr Livingstone said he expected to lose his disciplinary hearing next week on his suspension from the party, and indicated he will take Labour to court if that is the result. \nHe added: “I'm afraid we'll have to be off to a judicial review in the courts and in the court the issue will be what was actually said and what is the truth, and the Labour Party has got no chance of winning a judicial review. \n“I'm basically retired. I'm not seeking office. I haven't asked Jeremy or didn't ask Ed Miliband to send me to the House of Lords or anything like that. I'm a house husband, but I'm not having my political career defined at the end that I'm anti-Semitic.” \nMr Streeting later said he would not be \"losing any sleep\" over Mr Livingstone's comments: adding “I will take absolutely no lectures on loyalty from Ken Livingstone. John Mann MP call Ken Livingstone MP a 'Nazi apologist' \n“The only question is why Ken hasn't already been expelled from the Labour Party, rather than being stuck in the purgatory of suspension.” \nMr Livingstone's intervention comes amid bitter infighting over Labour's future, with deputy leader Tom Watson and Unite general secretary Len McCluskey engaged in a war of words over an alleged plot by the Corbyn-backing Momentum group to bolster the position of the hard-left by securing financial support from the union. \nMr McCluskey has accused Mr Watson of living in a \"world of skulduggery, smears and secret plots\", while the deputy leader has challenged the union boss to \"state categorically\" that Unite will never bankroll organisations seeking to take control of party structures.
