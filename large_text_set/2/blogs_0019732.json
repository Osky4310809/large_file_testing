Karl asked Spicer today if the administration thought that the commotion was all due to “manufactured anger” as opposed to any real concerns from town hall goers. \nSpicer argued that there was a “hybrid” of concerned citizens and professional protesters who travel to various Congressional districts just to make noise and grab media attention. Karl pushed back by asking if Trump recognized that there is “real anger” from those with concerns like losing coverage from Obamacare, though Spicer responded claiming that to be a “false narrative.” \nSpicer went on to defend the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, all while saying that the original plan was rolled out too quickly and cannot be sustained within the health care system. \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:59:08.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
