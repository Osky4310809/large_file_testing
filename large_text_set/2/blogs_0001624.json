Gorsuch starts meeting with the senators who will vote on his nomination today -- Vice President Pence is taking him to meet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at 10:30 a.m. Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire will also be shepherding Gorsuch around the hill to meet senators, especially those on the Judiciary Committee. \nPresident Trump meets with Supreme Court groups at 11:30 a.m. The Trump cabinet \nThe full Senate votes on Rex Tillerson’s nomination to be secretary of state, 2 p.m. \nSen. Judiciary considers Jeff Sessions’ nomination to be attorney general, 10:30 a.m., after Democrats ran out the clock on his hearing yesterday, forcing a delay. \nSen. Governmental Affairs to vote on nomination of Mick Mulvaney to be OMB director, 9:40 a.m. The Sen. Budget Committee will also vote on Mulvaney Thursday. African-American history month \nPresident Trump holds African-American History Month “listening session,” 9:30 a.m. What you missed yesterday Supreme Court nominee announced \nPresident Trump revealed his Supreme Court nominee , announcing last night he had selected Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Supreme Court justice, filling the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia almost a year ago. \n“I am a man of my word, I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time,” Mr. Trump said at the East Room announcement. “Today I am keeping another promise to the American people by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch ... to be of the United States Supreme Court.” LGBTQ protections \nThe White House says the new administration has no interest in rolling back protections of LGBTQ workers . \n“President Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community,” said a White House statement released Tuesday morning. \nThe statement appeared to come in response to rumors that Mr. Trump would soon sign an executive order that would remove some protections of LGBTQ people. Executive actions \nThe White House canceled the signing of the executive order on cyber security without explanation. The order was to notify agency and department heads that they will be held accountable for cyber security, CBS News’ Mark Knoller reported. \nAgency and department heads were to be directed to use the best practices from the private sector to enhance cyber security. They will also be required to prepare for the modernization of cyber security in their agencies. The Office of Management and Budget would oversee government-wide efforts to enhance cyber security. No vulnerability study has yet been made, according to a White House official said. \nJust before he signed the order, he held a “listening session” with cyber security experts. Kelly says DHS knew immigration/refugee ban was coming \nAnd with regard to Mr. Trump’s executive order halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and top-level DHS officials worked to push back against the perception that federal agencies were caught off guard by the order. \nAt a noon press conference, Kelly said DHS knew the order was coming, and that he had seen at least two drafts of it before Mr. Trump signed the final version of the order Friday evening. Some news reports had indicated Kelly found out about the order while mid-flight on Friday. \n“We did know the executive order was coming … we knew it was coming, it wasn’t a surprise, it was coming and then we implemented it,” Kelly said, noting that he “certainly didn’t learn about it on an airplane.” The Trump Cabinet \nIn an extraordianry and abrupt postponement, the nominations of Rep. Tom Price for HHS secretary and Steven Mnuchin for treasury were blocked by a Democratic boycott . The Senate Finance Committee was to vote this morning on both. Republicans delayed the committee votes on both indefinitely. \nSenate Judiciary Committee Democrats used an obscure Senate rule to delay the committee vote on the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. His vote, which is expected to be approved by the panel, will now take place tomorrow, and then his nomination would proceed to the full Senate. \nThere was some progress on nominations today, though. The Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee voted on the nominations of Rep. Ryan Zinke to be secretary of the interior and on former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be secretary of energy . Both were advanced to the full Senate. \nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted on Betsy DeVos to be education secretary. She was advanced to the full Senate for confirmation. \nIn the afternoon, the full Senate voted to confirm Elaine Chao as transportation secretary. She was confirmed with bipartisan support, with only six Democrats voting against her. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
