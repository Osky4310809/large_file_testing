(Cory Morse | MLive.com) (Cory Morse | MLive.com) comments \nWYOMING, MI -- Officers were led on a 15-minute high-speed car chase Thursday morning, beginning in Ottawa County before ending in a one-vehicle crash in Kent County. \nThree suspects were arrested after fleeing in a white Honda SUV, which rolled over and crashed into a Ramblewood Apartments sign near the intersection of Byron Center Ave. and Fox Run Road in Wyoming. \n\"It was a lengthy pursuit involving numerous agencies,\" Ottawa County Sheriff John Wolffis said. \"The vehicle eventually ended up being involved in an accident here in Wyoming.\" Two-county police chase ends in rollover \nThe chase began just after 9:30 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 23, as officers responded to a 911 call regarding a potential breaking-and-entering incident. \nDeputies arrived at the residence on Blair Street in Ottawa County as the suspects' vehicle was backing out of the driveway, Wolffis said. An attempt by police to stop the vehicle was unsuccessful. \nPolice said suspects headed east from the Olive Township address, reaching speeds as high as 97 mph on Fillmore Street. Officers backed off in an attempt to slow the fleeing SUV, but kept the vehicle in sight while additional officers were dispatched. \nMultiple attempts to deploy stop sticks failed during the approximately 20-mile chase. The chased ended when the SUV rolled over and came to a stop at about 9:50 a.m. near the apartment complex entrance in Wyoming. \n\"They lost control here and rolled up into the sign,\" Wolffis said. \n\"(During the chase), we had to weigh in the factors. This was a home invasion, the suspects were believed to be armed. There was a risk to the public if they weren't captured.\" \nAll three suspects declined medical treatment, police said. \nAssisting Ottawa County were the Kent County Sheriff's Department, Wyoming Police, Grandville Police and Michigan State Police.
