A scene from \"Chapter and Verse,\" screening as part of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Black Bottom Film Festival. By Courtney Linder / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nOf the 10 productions in August Wilson’s Pittsburgh Cycle, just one play takes place outside the Hill District —“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” a 1982 chronicle of black exploitation within Chicago’s 1920s recording industry. \nThirty-five years after its inception, the city will pay homage to the title with the first Black Bottom Film Festival, kicking off Friday at the August Wilson Center for African American Culture, Downtown. \n“It’s really fitting to have it there; August Wilson is such a prolific playwright,” said Janis Burley Wilson, vice president of strategic partnerships and community engagement at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. \nThe film festival, a celebration of classic black film along with independent black cinema, honors the Pittsburgh Cycle’s reoccurring themes of spirituality, family conflict, race and working-class struggle while also highlighting black filmmakers’ knack for using craft as a forum to uplift, confront and educate. \n“August gave a voice to a wide range of black people in this country who never had a mirror to look at, so to speak,” said longtime director Michael Schultz. “I would call him the Black Shakespeare — he just had a way with words.” A scene from \"Destination: Planet Negro!\" part of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Black Bottom Film Festival. \nMr. Schultz has a knack for depicting black narratives, as well, including some of his most famous films — such as the 1975 feature “Cooley High,” the 1976 comedy “Car Wash” and 1977’s “Which Way Is Up?,” which is widely regarded as Richard Pryor’s first breakaway starring role. \n“The hardest job I had in making [’Which Way Is Up?’] was trying to keep the crew from laughing and spoiling the takes,” Mr. Schultz said. “There are some parts in the film where if you look closely, you can still see people cracking up, because [Mr. Pryor] would come up with things that weren’t in the script but fit perfectly.” \nThe films Mr. Schultz created over the years tended to smartly blend this infectious type of comedy with poignant social commentary. In “Car Wash,” for example, Mr. Schultz diligently balanced humor with real stories of blue-collar black workers. \n“I thought without the serious elements, it would be just another popcorn movie,” he said. \nMr. Schultz, originally from Milwaukee, was one of the first black directors hired by the major studios, and he blazed a trail for future black filmmakers such as Spike Lee. \nTo honor Mr. Schultz’s creative contributions, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust will present him with the Black Bottom Film Festival Award for Cinematic Excellence on Saturday evening with a piece made by internationally renowned Pittsburgh-based artist Thad Mosley. Mr. Mosley, fittingly, is the creator behind the wooden sculpture housed in the August Wilson Center. \nAfterward, there will be a double-feature presentation of “Cooley High” and “Which Way Is Up?” \nThat’s not to say that indie movies or local directors will be ignored. The festival will also feature work from local filmmakers Njaimeh Njie, who directed the shorts “A Day in the Life of a Hashtag” and “African in America”; Emmai Alaquiva, director of the short “Ghetto Steps”; and Demetrius Wren, director of the short “Father’s Day.” \nMr. Wren, along with Mr. Schultz and filmmaker Jamal Joseph, will also be available for Q&A sessions throughout the weekend. Through these conversations, workshops and screenings, Ms. Wilson and Mr. Schultz hope to nurture conversations about the black experience and film that might otherwise remain unexplored by outside communities. \n“I come from a school of thought that theater and film should entertain and uplift and allow the audience to step into shoes of people that they would not ordinarily walk in,” Mr. Schultz said. “You’re able to build a bridge of understanding through the experience of the person onscreen. Entertainment, for me, was always a key component of that formula.” \nCourtney Linder: clinder@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1707.
