Inside there’s a murdered-out personalized interior, a Bose sound system, and illuminated door sills lighting up some of the iconic actor’s famous words: “Racing is life. Anything that happens before or after is just waiting.”\nIf you have the cash, head over to RM Sotheby’s to place a bid. Twenty five percent of the winning bid will be donated to the Gustave Roussy Foundation, the world’s leading cancer research institute.\nIn other news, Fast and Furious’ s Sung Kang shows off his killer Datsun 240Z .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T12:15:54.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
