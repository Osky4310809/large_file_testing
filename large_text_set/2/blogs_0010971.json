And it looks like Trump's favorite daughter, Ivanka, agrees. Take a look at the way the First Daughter hungrily eyes Trudeau during his recent visit to the White House. \nTuesday night on Desus & Mero 's very special Valentine's Day episode, Kid Mero and Desus Nice talked about Ivanka's unapologetic puppy love and how the Donald needs to look outâ€”not only has Justin Trudeau outsmarted Trump's weird handshake power play move , but now he's moving in on his daughter (or she on him, at least). \nYou can watch last night's Desus & Mero for free online now, and be sure to catch new episodes weeknights at 11 PM on VICELAND.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T15:03:18.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
