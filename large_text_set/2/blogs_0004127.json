UG editor. Music lover. Constant searcher of something interesting and unique. Posted a day ago 0 \nRonnie James Dio's hologram made its US debut on February 2nd at the Pollstar Awards. \nThe performance was backed by Dio Disciples and took place at The Novo in Los Angeles, CA. \nWatch official footage below. a month ago in Music news , 20 comments 73 2 years ago in WTF? , 36 comments 9 2 years ago in New releases , 11 comments Trending stories 4 hours ago in Music news , 17 comments 19 13 hours ago in Music news , 26 comments 12 @ User Post a comment I had to stop when he picked up the pollstar banner halfway through the song... just a shitty ad plug by a shitty company. Using a dead guy for $$$ and advertising. This is complete shit. Whats next a Taco Bell banner? Whoever pays the most for dead Dio to hold it up? 10 For me it looks creepy... 2 Author N-D [ug] 5,393 · 23 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply If I was enough stoned and I stood far from the stage I would have thought that this hologram was real. 4 Having him hold up a banner for whatever company halfway through really rubs me the wrong way. 3 Leave the dead in peace. This is a cynical moneygrab. 4 when he said \"i can't hear you\" it's kinda weird... 2 I wonder if Ronnie said he'd be cool with this. I still don't know how I feel about it. 0 UltimateGuizar [m] 220 · 23 hours ago · permalink · ↑ reply I'm cool with it if it's taking away the financial burden of his illness and death for his loved ones. He was pretty famous, but being well known in the metal world doesn't necessarily mean you're loaded. Otherwise, it's gross. 0 That is far from the situation and the same goes for all of these hologram shows popping up. It's just a quick buck being made off the career of a legend. 0 Then like I said, gross. 0 There is something very creepy and not right about this... 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:26:01.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
