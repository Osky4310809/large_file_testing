We already knew Cable will be in it, and writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have hinted at “a lot of characters” now that they have the budget for better-known X-Men. (The first film included Negasonic Teenage Warhead because a Fox exec didn’t know who she was .)\nNow we’re hearing one of those new additions is Domino, the mercenary who can manipulate probability to make herself more lucky. Domino has been a rumored character since the first movie, but the recent rumors about Mackenzie Davis taking the role were already shot down . Now That Hashtag Show obtained a character breakdown for a Domino-esque role which even used Domino’s real name, Neena.\nMore importantly, they claim insider knowledge about who might be up for the role. Reportedly, Sienna Miller and Gugu Mbatha-Raw are already out of contention, and now Kerry Washington ( Scandal ) is testing for the role and “is the studio’s lead at this point.”\nHere’s That Hashtag Show hosts Joe and Myverick reading the character breakdown, or continue on for the transcript of it.\n\n\n“Female. All ethnicities. Late 20s to early 30s. Sexy, lithe, and athletic. She has a witty personality. Neena is a no-nonsense badass who rarely shows her feelings. Highly capable, supremely confident and armored in — well armor — and bullet-proof sarcasm. But beneath her shell she’s still and vulnerable and some soft, beating remnant of her humanity remains intact. In this scene we need to see both sides. When she can’t get what she needs with insults, bluster and threats we need to see some of that vulnerability. It’s hard for her to let down her guard, and in the mercenary community she grew up in showing compassion is almost embarrassing. We should feel like she’d be more comfortable killing Silberman than saying ‘Please’.”\nAnd if that’s not enough Deadpool news, Ryan Reynolds is once again celebrating an anniversary of Deadpool ‘s release by posting a joke. Finally, a product suitably absorbent for our $240 worth of pudding .\n\n(Via That Hashtag Show , We Got This Covered , and Ryan Reynolds )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:01:46.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
