He’s been dead on the show for a while now, but the series began during his reign (Then Cersei, his wife, basically arranged his “accidental” death). Well, a different G ame of Thrones actor nearly played King Robert , and it’s definitely a big surprise.\nActor Mark Addy played King Robert Baratheon, who died way back in season one. However, another actor in the series almost played the character — and it’s kind of surprising. Conleth Hill, who now plays Varys, was also up for the role.\n\nHill tells The Huffington Post : “It is true, to be honest, but I have to say that I came out of the meeting, which went all right, and looked who was in after me, saw who it was, and went, ‘Well, he’d be all right for it,’ and he was, and he got it. You know, that’s showbiz.” Varies is just *such* a different character than King Robert. We wouldn’t expect the show’s creators to consider the same actor for both roles. But, Hill actually lucked out: Varys is still on the show. Also, Varys is often a voice of reason on the show, so he’s someone we like to root for.\nOf course, there were some drawbacks.\n“I read for it, parts of the dungeon scene with Ned and the chest scene where he explains how he was made from sort of a slave to the security of Westeros.” The unfortunate part came after he was offered the role: “…and I think once I had already accepted the part, they said, ‘How do you feel about shaving your head?’” \nDespite having to shave his head, and not getting to play a king, it seems to have worked out for Hill. After all, Varys still has a large role in Game of Thrones . We don’t know what’s in store for his character next season, of course — but we’re hoping it’s better than King Robert’s death-by-boar, at least.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-24T02:28:55.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
