Could   \nThis year's UK Eurovision entry looks set for nil points – after the BBC selected SIX finalists who've all flopped on rival show X Factor . \nThe BBC today confirmed the acts that will compete for the honour of representing the United Kingdom at Eurovision 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine. \nThey include Danyl Johnson and Lucie Jones, who both got to the final of the ITV show in 2009, Salena Mastroianni, Holly Brewer, Olivia Garcia and Nate Simpson. \nThey'll each battle it out on the event's 90-minute selection show, this Friday, which will be hosted by Mel Giedroyc and broadcast live on BBC Two from 7.30pm. \nBut fans of the annual competition have already expressed concern. Specifically, because the last time BBC bosses chose an X Factor star was Andy Abrahams in 2008. He came last. Danyl Johnson is the most famous X Factor reject (Photo: ITV) Lucie Jones also tried her luck on the talent show, but failed (Photo: ITV) Nate Simpson is just a vague memory for most people (Photo: Splash News) Read More Katie Price's fans name her \"queen of pop\" after she takes centre stage on karaoke \nThe six acts and songs - which can be heard via bbc.co.uk/eurovision - were revealed on BBC Radio 2’s Ken Bruce show, Monday, and have so far failed to impress listeners. \nOne said: \"The UK's Eurovision contenders have been revealed and we're definitely not going to win\", while another hater added: \"Oh my God, the UK's Eurovision song choices suck. They're just all so bland!\" \nAnother was even more cynical, saying: \"It does not matter which song or group we choose it could be the best song by far we will never win!\". \nThankfully, they won't be the only performers on the night. \nAn expert panel will be on hand to offer their thoughts on how the songs could be made to look and sound on stage in Kyiv. They are Bruno Tonioli, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and CeCe Sammy. \nEurovision: You Decide will also feature two special music performances; the first from 2009 winner Alexander Rybak performing his classic song Fairytale, and the second, by British Pop Rock Band, The Vamps performing their song All Night.
