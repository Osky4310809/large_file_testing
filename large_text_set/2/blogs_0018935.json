The brownie layer serves as a nice base and then the rich raspberry cheesecake finishes off these decadent treats. Plus, these things look great on your social media feeds. Raspberry Brownie Mini Cheesecake [Vegan, Gluten-Free] This Recipe is : 2 1/2 cups dates, pitted 1 cup raw cocoa powder 2 cups walnuts 2 1/2 cups cashews, soaked overnight 3 lemons, juiced 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon agave 1/3 cup coconut oil 2 cup frozen raspberries, thawed Preparation To Make the Crust: Place the walnuts and almonds into the food processor and blend them until the nuts are finely ground. Add cocoa, salt and blend again for 1-2 minutes. Slowly add dates while the processor is running. Work until the “dough” or mixture easily sticks together (if it doesn’t add 1-2 more dates). Line a cupcake mold with plastic wrap and press about 2-4 tablespoons (depending on the mould) of the crust batter into the mold. Place the cupcake mold into the freezer to harden. To Make the Filling: Strain the cashews of any leftover water and blend them with the lemon juice and vanilla. Heat them together with the coconut oil and agave syrup. Add into the cashew mix and blend until smooth. Try to avoid any chunks. Bring out the cupcake mold and pour enough of the fill to cover at least 1/3 of each mold. Place them back into the freezer for the layer to harden. Blend or process the leftover mixture with raspberries. When the layer is ready, top the cupcake mold with this raspberry cheesecake mix. Store them in the freezer. Defrost in the refrigerator for 20-30 mins before eating and garnish them with fresh or frozen raspberries.
