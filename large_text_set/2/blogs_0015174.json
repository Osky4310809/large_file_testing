Advertisement - story continues below Historian Launches His Countdown To The Pence Presidency \nThe official flag of the United States contains nine alternating rows of six and five stars. \nPhotographs show the flag in Brussels with three rows of nine stars alternating with three rows of eight stars. \nMedia inquiries into the reason for the extra star were not readily answered by the EU Council.

The reports @MunSecConf of the death of the West have been greatly exaggerated. #MSC2017 pic.twitter.com/TajxoQkpxe \n— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) February 20, 2017 \nAccording to the Brussels Times , the vice president was visiting Brussels in “the second stage of a European tour designed to reassure concerned allies about the White House’s new occupant Donald Trump, who wants Europe to contribute more to the collective defence.” Advertisement - story continues below \nDuring the meeting, Pence confirmed that the United States is “totally committed” to NATO. @BBCNews is it an intentional snub having 51 stars on the American flag behind Pence? \n— Richard Keir (@keirrichard) February 20, 2017 \nThe current American flag was designed in 1958 by Robert Heft, a high school student, as an assignment in his history class in anticipation of the addition of Alaska and Hawaii. \nAlthough Heft only received a B-minus for his design, he sent a prototype of his design to the White House, where President Dwight Eisenhower chose it for the new flag. \nHis history project grade was increased to an A. \nThe Brussels incident was not the first time a 51-star flag has made an appearance. \nIn 2012, when Puerto Rico was seeking statehood, Smithsonian.com released an article that revealed several designs that could accommodate the addition of a 51st star.
