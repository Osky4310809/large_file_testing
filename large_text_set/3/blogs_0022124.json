According to House Speaker Paul Ryan, that's exactly what he did. \nBut Ryan said that Trump \"came here and knocked the ball out of the park, he knocked the cover off the ball, in explaining to our members how it's important to unify, how it's important to work together, how we are advancing our principles and we are doing what we told the American people we would do.\" \nIn terms of what exactly Trump told Congress, we know he served up a warning to Republicans who don't vote for the Obamacare replacement plan. \"Many of you will lose\" in the 2018 midterm elections if you choose to vote against AHCA, Trump reportedly told the lawmakers. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounded the same alarm on Tuesday, noting he'd \" hate \" to be a Republican who does not side with their health care plan. \nMany of those hesitant Republicans belong to the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who argue the AHCA is Obamacare 2.0. Speaker Ryan is under the impression that enough of the caucus members have come onboard to guarantee a successful vote. Yet, his confidence is not shared by members like Justin Amash, who says the House leadership is overestimating their support. They haven't changed the bill's general framework. They don't have the votes to pass it. They have seriously miscalculated. https://t.co/Rg7myfgrRm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T01:35:22.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
