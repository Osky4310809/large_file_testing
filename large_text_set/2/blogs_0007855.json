Trump on immigration Ex-CIA officials say Trump’s travel ban has “no national security purpose” Apple, Google, and 95 other tech firms join forces to fight Trump travel ban Appeals court denies DOJ’s late-night bid to immediately restore travel ban Prof: “Can you sue the President based on his tweets? We’re about to find out” Judge rules against DOJ in Amazon, Expedia case against Trump travel ban View more stories A federal appeals court late Thursday upheld a lower court's decision blocking the travel ban that was implemented under executive order by President Donald Trump two weeks ago.\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals was reviewing a decision by US District Judge James L. Robart, who last week ruled against Trump’s executive order and imposed a nationwide temporary restraining order. In both the hearings before the 9th Circuit earlier this week, as well as before the lower district court, lawyers from the Department of Justice largely argued that the states of Washington and Minnesota had no standing to challenge the executive order, and that it was well within the president's right to set immigration policy. The 9th Circuit disagreed on both counts.\n\"There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,\" the appeals court concluded .\nThe Department of Justice said it was reviewing the decision and \"considering its options.\" They include letting the ruling stand, asking the appeals court to rehear the case or seeking Supreme Court review.\nTrump responded almost immediately after:\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017\nThe ban, which affected people from seven Middle Eastern and African countries that are predominantly Muslim, was immediately challenged in more than 15 lawsuits filed nationwide. They include:Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, and Yemen.\nHowever, the one that was filed on January 30 on behalf of the States of Washington and Minnesota—and supported by two Washington companies, Amazon and Expedia, is the one that has been the fastest-moving.\nWhat's more, in a letter filed to the government last week , Microsoft explained that it has 76 employees (along with their 41 dependents) who were affected by the executive order. The company asked that federal authorities create a \"case-by-case\" exception for those who already hold a valid and relevant visa, have no criminal record, and have a pressing need to leave the country for business or exigent family reasons.\nThe lawsuit drew wide support from more than 100 tech companies, from Apple to Zynga.\nAccording to the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a trade organization, 58 percent of Silicon Valley’s STEM workers are foreign-born. Even if tech companies have relatively few people that are affected, some firms are now worried that similar immigration restrictions could be put into place. One group from Canada quickly formed as a way to offer a \"turnkey\" solution for tech companies to relocate a subsidiary to Vancouver and transfer workers who are impacted by the ban.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829836231802515457", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3457878-SVCIP-2016.html#document/p6/a337770", "https://www.thetruenorth.me/", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3457905-Document-7.html", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3457905-Document-7.html#document/p14/a337783", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3438903-WA-refugee-lawsuit.html"], "published": "2017-02-10T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:51:05.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
