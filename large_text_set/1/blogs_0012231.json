For adults with multiple sclerosis-related muscle spasms, cannabis taken orally was found to improve symptoms. \nAt the same time, the study found in states where marijuana use is legal, there is an increased risk of overdose among children. The academy also says there is evidence of an increased risk of mental illnesses like schizophrenia and anxiety disorders for marijuana users. Heavy marijuana users are more likely that non-users to have suicidal thoughts, according to the results. \nResearchers found more than 22 million Americans, ages 12 and over, have used marijuana in the past 30 days. Of those users, 10 percent were for medical purposes only and just over a third for a combination of medical and recreational purposes. In the study, researchers found “moderate” evidence on marijuana dependency, and concluded smoking marijuana during pregnancy is linked to low birth weight babies. \nIn the report, the Academy wrote, “as laws and policies change, research must also.” \nWBZ NewsRadio 1030’s Lana Jones reports Lana Jones Follow Follow Lana on Twitter Lana Jones is a general assignment reporter for WBZ Newsradio 1030.
