To ensure you’re creating an airtight policy, this is a section best tackled with the help of your legal team. \nWhoever has access to your social media accounts must credit original sources if they are reposting or borrowing content. Research other areas of legal concern that might be relevant to your business’ social media policy in your geographical area. Beyond copyright laws, this might include things like privacy concerns and rules around financial disclosures. \nIn addition to employees posting on behalf of your brand, you need to set guidelines for those who may talk about your brand from their personal accounts. \nThe best way to go about this is to lay out clear privacy and disclosure clauses within the legal portion of your policy. Make sure your employees know to protect confidential information about your company, whether the brand’s, their own, or your customers’. Even if they aren’t posting from your official accounts, they are still representing your brand. Safety and security guidelines \nThreats such as malware, phishing scams, account hacking, and human error can be avoided with a clear social media policy. There are many risks your employees might not be aware of, and a policy can help educate them on and fill in these gaps. \nWhen building your policy, make sure you’re consulting your in-house legal team, security and compliance department, IT, and executive counsel. Our post 5 Social Media Security Risks for Businesses (and How to Avoid Them) suggests including guidelines on how to: Create a secure password Avoid spam, phishing attacks, and human error Share on-brand and approved content Engage properly on behalf of the brand Avoid social media platforms’ default privacy and security settings Proceed in the event of an attack Social media policy examples \nIf you’re looking for more detail on creating a social media policy, the Social Media Governance Policy Database is a great resource. \nHere, you will find examples and insight into how companies are actually building and using social media policies.
