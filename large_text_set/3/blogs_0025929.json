Earth Hour is just one of the many activities that they will participate in. There are other projects lined up,” Ibay added.   \nOne of the activities was the setting up of interactive booths featuring information on disaster preparedness, reforestation and native tree planting and renewable energy technologies. Some of the booths were located at the SM by the Bay, Mall of Asia Complex. \n“We took to heart the role of the youth as the key to further propel the country to a climate-resilient one. We continue to engage and encourage the public to emphasize that together, we thrive,” said WWF-Philippines president and CEO Joel Palma. \nEarth Hour has grown in the past decade from a symbolic switch-off event in Sydney, Australia to the world’s largest open-sourced environmental campaign, catalyzing environmental and social projects with tangible outcomes, while mobilizing hundreds of millions of people in over 7,000 cities in 176 countries, organizers said. \nThe Philippines topped global participation records from 2009 to 2012 – earning it the title Earth Hour Hero Country. \nIbay said more and more people are taking part in the Earth Hour activity, indicating growing awareness of environment concerns. \n“Earth Hour is definitely more than just the symbolic switch-off as it aims to bring concrete solutions at a time when the challenges of climate change and environmental issues are all too real, yet showing the power of collective climate action,” Ibay added. \nSen. Loren Legarda, meanwhile, lauded individuals, corporations, government offices that participated in this year’s observance of Earth Hour. \nLegarda said that saving on electricity, using low carbon technologies, conserving water, eating local food, planting more trees, among others, are just some of the simple ways by which individuals can significantly contribute to protecting the planet. \n“Beyond that, we can join the rest of the world in efforts to save energy, reduce carbon emissions and raise awareness on sustainability and environmental challenges,” Legarda said. \n“Every year, nations, communities, industries and individuals participate in Earth Hour, switching off non-essential lights for an hour. Last year, 178 countries and territories participated and more than 12,000 landmarks and monuments around the world switched off their lights during Earth Hour,” she said. \n“This shows that we are all capable of protecting our environment and of taking climate action,” Legarda said. \n“Earth Hour proves that we can protect our planet. It proves that small acts, when put together, create big change. I hope that we can go beyond Earth Hour and imbibe environment-friendly practices as a way of life,” she added. \nIn a statement, Camarines Sur Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte said President Duterte’s decision to sign the treaty on climate change and its ratification by the Senate last week “are timely and significant.” – Jess Diaz, Marvin Sy, Christina Mendez  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T10:42:22.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
