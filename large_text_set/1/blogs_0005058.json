The search giant outlined the plans in a blog post earlier today as it continues to expand Google Assistant to more products and services.\nGoogle’s intelligent digital assistant, launched with its Pixel phones last October, lets users engage in a two-way conversation to achieve certain tasks. Its number of actions cover a wide range of scenarios — from booking a table at a restaurant to checking the local weather — but for its TV integration, Google says that Assistant can help:\nPlay content: “Play Stranger Things on Netflix.” (Providing you have a Netflix account) Discover content: “Search YouTube for Jimmy Kimmel.” (You can also follow-up if you’re interested in more videos by saying: “Play the second one.”) Get answers: “Tell me about Jurassic Park?” Set the right mood: “Dim the lights.” Get ready for your day: “How long will it take to get to work?” \nGoogle also revealed that the NVIDIA SHIELD would be the first TV device to support Assistant, but that it would also come to all Android TVs in the US which run Android Marshmallow or higher, such as the “AirTV Player, Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia, Xiaomi Mi Box” and others.\nGoogle didn’t provide a concrete date for Assistant’s rollout, but the company is already behind competitors Apple and Amazon in this sphere. Their digital assistants, Siri and Alexa respectively, are already integrated into their current TV streaming products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T17:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T12:42:16.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
