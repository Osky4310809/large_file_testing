But after many delays and logistical concerns, Hyperloop technology is finally inching closer to becoming reality. \nWorkers have begun laying track on a Hyperloop test space about 30 minutes from Las Vegas. The test “tube” stretches 500 meters across the Nevada desert and, upon completion, should give researchers a better idea of what to expect if/when the Hyperloop becomes reality. \n%image4 Monitoring tests at the Innovation Campus in Los Angeles.

The capsule itself is about 2.7 meters in diameter while the elevated tube measures 3.3 meters across. Tubes arriving and waiting to be installed at the site in North Las Vegas.

The 65-mile journey would take 12 minutes to complete via Hyperloop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T00:20:46.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
