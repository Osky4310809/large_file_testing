Obviously, Jericho lasted the longest tonight, and he almost had it, but it just wasn’t meant to be. Next up, Reigns sent out Bray Wyatt to have him and Orton as the final two. \nAt one point, all three members of The New Day were on the apron and falling backward when Sheamus and Cesaro sent them to the floor. Right after that, Cesaro tried to eliminate Sheamus, but both men were dumped out immediately by Chris Jericho. \nRandy Orton Wins The 2017 WWE Royal Rumble Match #WWE #RoyalRumble https://t.co/liAl3odcMC pic.twitter.com/uyepN5QTTm \n— Still Real To Us (@stillreal2us) January 30, 2017 \nOther results from the Royal Rumble on Sunday night: WWE Championship: John Cena defeated AJ Styles for the title WWE Universal Championship: Kevin Owens retained over Roman Reigns Raw Women’s Championship: Charlotte Flair retained over Bayley Nia Jax defeated Sasha Banks Raw Tag Team Championship: Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson defeated Cesaro and Sheamus for the titles Naomi, Nikki Bella, and Becky Lynch defeated Alexa Bliss, Natalya, and Mickie James \nAt the end of it all, the surprise entrants ended up being just some names from the main roster and the only real exciting two were Jack Gallagher and Tye Dillinger. There was no Rey Mysterio or Kurt Angle or Samoa Joe or Shaquille O’Neal or any of the other countless rumors floating around lately. \nThe Royal Rumble is officially over for another year, and it was a very entertaining start of the “Road to WrestleMania 33 .” The complete order of entries and eliminations shows just who was dominant and who didn’t do a whole lot during the night. In the end, some of the rumors ended up being true for the surprise entrants, but most of them were nothing more than fillers from the WWE main roster. Once all was said and done, Randy Orton had won the match to an incredible ovation. \n[Featured Image by WWE]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T10:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T05:54:13.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
