It’s not an entirely new concept, but it’s one that many of us (including myself) still haven’t gotten used to: smartphones without a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nManufacturers are constantly progressing in smartphone design. Bezels are getting smaller, screen-to-body ratios are increasing , and phones are also getting thinner. So thin, in fact, that some OEMs find it absolutely necessary to remove a ‘feature’ that’s been included on smartphones since the day smartphones came to market.\nLeEco and Apple were some of the first companies to remove the headphone jack from their smartphones, and since then, other OEMs have followed. Lenovo removed the headphone jack from the Moto Z , and HTC followed suit with the Bolt and recently released U Ultra .\nSee also: New colors and headphone ports: the new smartphone “features” 2 days ago It’s understandable (not necessarily preferable) why OEMs are making the decision to remove the headphone jack. To make phones thinner, you need to start making sacrifices, and that means removing features that OEMs deem unnecessary. Plus, there are a few benefits to USB Type-C audio over a 3.5mm headphone jack, which you can read about in this post .\nWith that said, we want to know – would you buy a smartphone without a headphone jack, or is that a must-have feature for you? Be sure to cast your vote in the poll below, and speak up in the comments if there’s anything you’d like to add. We look forward to hearing what you have to say!\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:28:54.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
