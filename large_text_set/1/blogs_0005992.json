Wilkins apologized after the Tigers' win for being \"silly,\" but Boulware doesn't think his teammate did anything that wrong. \n\"That's something we've done all year to mess with players,\" Boulware admitted to reporters on Wednesday. \"No one's probably done it as aggressive as Christian did. We try to be a little more discreet about it and just poke somebody. He grabbed a handful.\" \nAlthough Boulware kept repeating that Wilkins touched the opponent's butt, it's clear in the video that the defensive lineman went for his crotch. \n“The game is so serious and it’s so locked in out there, you try to do stuff just to have fun, to break up the seriousness of the game,\" Boulware said, according to SI.com . \"People are trying to say ‘sexual assault’ — people that say that have either never played football, have never been in a locker room and seen the weird stuff. We’re together every day for years and years and years. You get very comfortable around each other. I know there’s going to be that one person [who says] ‘Well, I played football and I never did that.’ You either sucked at football, you had no friends in the locker room, or you were the person that went in the bathroom stall to go change because you were scared to shower with the team.\" Christian Wilkins gets his hand between the legs of Ohio State's Curtis Samuel. (YouTube 9,999,999 Views) \nBoulware added: \"It's annoying, because the players don't care. Like, you saw [Curtis] Samuel didn't do anything at all. That's for the media to blow that up. Yes, Christian went — he went four fingers deep. He went a little too far. But when I'm just messing with somebody, poking them in the belly button or grabbing someone's butt, it's just to break up the seriousness of the game.\" \nClemson coach Dabo Swinney didn't seem to have a problem with Wilkins' behavior either. \n“He’s a guy that can be a little silly at times,” Swinney said. “We don’t have a better young man on the team than Christian Wilkins. [He] apologized for it, apologized to the kid, that’s really it.” \nNo. 2 Clemson faces No. 1 Alabama at 8 p.m. on Monday in the national championship game.
