Andy Neiman of the Los Angeles Police Department.\nNeiman said the suspect was taken to a hospital, but his condition was not available. Police had earlier reported that an unresponsive man was down at the scene and an ambulance had been requested.\nOfficers with the LAPD’s Central Traffic Division were flagged down and “directed to an individual,” at which time an officer-involved shooting occurred, Neiman said.\n“There were reports he was possibly armed with a knife,” but that could not be immediately confirmed, the captain said.\n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
