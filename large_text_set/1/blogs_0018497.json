She also made a very public statement about the right to breastfeed in public. The plus-size model attended the march with her infant son, Bowie, in tow. When the 7-month-old became hungry and, as Holliday stated, “overwhelmed by the crowd,” she calmed him by feeding him, and shared a photo of the moment on Instagram. Holliday originally posted the shot with the following caption: “Breastfeed anywhere ✊???? Thank you to my friend @jessicalouiseimagery for capturing this moment during today’s @womensmarchla #normalizebreastfeeding#womensmarchla.” She was showered with praise by many fans. “Go Sister! Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing,” one follower wrote. “What a powerful photo!! Love it. I don’t get how feeding your baby is still an issue #normalizebreastfeeding,” another said. “Thank you for posting this. Thank you for being strong, for you, your partner, and your son. This is a gorgeous photo! Keep them coming! #normalizebreastfeeding,” wrote another. You get the picture. But then one commenter gave her a backhanded compliment: “I love this! But girl use a blanket lol.” And others followed, some telling her to “cover up,” others, going deeper: “1) Taking a baby to a march sounds like a bad idea. Like honestly what is this ‘overloaded his senses’ bs, it’s a baby it should be somewhere peaceful. 2. Forget the law it’s just flat out uncomfortable to see someone breastfeeding. It should be common courtesy to cover up when feeding.” Holliday shot back. She edited her caption to address the comment: “Those saying that I should ‘cover up’ You mean when I’m breastfeeding MY baby who was a) hungry & b) screaming because he was overly tired & the crowd overloaded his senses & it was the only way to comfort him?! I will feed my child anywhere I want. Also CA state law protects me to do so.” She ended her caption with a pointed note: “Keep your uneducated opinions off my body.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-24T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T21:12:36.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
