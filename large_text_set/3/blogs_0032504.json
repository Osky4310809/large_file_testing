All these are used for domestic American political agendas . The anti-Russian card is played by different political forces inside the United States to trade on that and consolidate their positions inside.\" \nPutin refuted the findings of a January ODN report which in January found that \"Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary (Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,\" the report said, adding that intelligence agencies have \"high confidence\" in that assessment, although have yet to release any of the facts backing the assessment. \nFInally, Putin explicitly denied that Russia meddled in the U.S. elections. Putin quoted George Bush when asked if the \"Russian government had ever tried to influence the outcome of the US presidential election, and there will be no evidence found?\" to which he responded \"Watch my lips, no.\" Did Russia ever interfere in the U.S. elections? \nRussia's Putin: \"Watch my lips -- No.\" https://t.co/g3Jbx1kVtS pic.twitter.com/KMyK0cA04z", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T16:34:18.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
