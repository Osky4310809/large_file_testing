But anyone who signs for Real Madrid is in danger. There are players, spoiled superstars, who if they go against the coach it affects the team's performance.\" \nDe Laurentiis also spoke about the â‚¬90 million departure of forward Gonzalo Higuain from Napoli to Juventus last summer, saying that the Argentina international had been \"ruined\" by too much positive media coverage. \n\"The whole [Higuain] operation was a total success,\" he said. \"At Real Madrid he did not get the exposure he had at Napoli. But sometimes the media create heroes at a club, and not always these supposed heroes can take the recognition. They are young kids, and the media can ruin these people. He had a good year. But he missed penalties that meant we missed out on second place and qualification for the Champions League.\" \nHiguain's family had wanted to control which players were in the Napoli starting XI, De Laurentiis claimed. \n\"[Higuain's] brother always told me -- 'Higuain does not like playing with [Jose] Callejon, buy other players,'\" De Laurentiis added. \"I never paid him any attention as I love Callejon. So I extended his contract four years. I am not a man who you can blackmail.\" \nDermot Corrigan is a Madrid-based football writer who covers La Liga and the Spain national team for ESPN FC.
