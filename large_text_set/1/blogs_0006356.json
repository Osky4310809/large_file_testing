Still, ESPN’s halftime crew looked like they were having a blast when the cameras focused on them. \nWhile Suzy Kolber welcomed viewers to halftime, Charles Woodson, Trent Dilfer, and Randy Moss were in the middle of something else that wasn’t clear at first. From the live broadcast, you could have assumed it was probably due to unpreparedness. You first hear the ruffling of papers and then laughing. \nBut they’re professionals who are more prepared than we imagine. Therefore, there is only one way to explain what the fuss about: Trent Dilfer farted. \nLook, there is no concrete evidence of the fart taking place while the cameras and microphone focused on them, but take a look at everything that transpired.\nCharles Woodson is laughing and waving his papers at Dilfer \nYou instantly knew something was up thanks to Woodson. He may be happy to see his Raiders in the postseason, but the team was down at the half and yet he’s still elated. He’s fanning the fart away from himself. \nRandy Moss is pissed \nThis is the most convincing part of the theory. What can make one person giggle endlessly and another incredibly uncomfortable, almost angry? Something inappropriate like a fart. Moss looks mortified, but this is a specific type of fear. Fart fear. \nTrent Dilfer is having the time of his life. \nBut Randy Moss quickly turned to Matt Hasselbeck as he fannd himself. So it might not be Dilfer who dealt it. Was it Hasselbeck?
