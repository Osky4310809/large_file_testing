He had been detained for two months in 2014 before joining an Islamic State cell in Sinai, the government said.\n\"Finally, to my brothers in captivity: rejoice, you believers, do not falter or grieve. I swear to God we will very soon liberate Cairo and free you from captivity. We will come bearing explosives, I swear we will, so rejoice you believers,\" he said in the video.\nIncludes clip from Abu Abdullah al-Masry, the suicide bomber who blew himself up on 11DEC16 at the St Paul and St Peter's Church in Cairo\n— Jantzen Garnett (@JantzenGarnett) February 19, 2017\nNew #IS video from #Egypt 'And fight against the disbelievers collectively' targets #Copts , praises Dec. 2016 Cairo cathedral bombing pic.twitter.com/ybHZfF1izt\n— Pieter Nanninga (@pieternanninga) February 19, 2017\nProbably poor timing on the part of Pope Francis, whose visit with Coptic Pope Tawadros II is included in the Islamic State video:\n security/2017/02/19/new-islamic-state-video-threatens-egyptian-christians-shows-december-church-suicide-bomber/\nload more", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/trending?src=hash", "https://t.co/hzBoE1N8zJ", "https://twitter.com/pieternanninga/status/833359999984365568", "https://t.co/ybHZfF1izt", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Copts?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/PJMedia_com/status/807975634815201282", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-security-church-idUSKBN15Y0S7", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Egypt?src=hash", "https://t.co/V2hxvJ1TXw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/IS?src=hash", "https://t.co/R6gtvvnOd7", "https://twitter.com/OrenKessler/status/832639630843473920", "https://twitter.com/JantzenGarnett/status/833369681180360705"], "published": "2017-02-19T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:43:20.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
