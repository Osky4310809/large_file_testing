Deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh is leaving her role to take up a position with America First Policies, an outside group set up to steer President Donald Trump’s agenda. The group was notably absent during the recent health care debate — with no television ads or persuasion campaign to speak of — and Walsh’s departure was cast as an effort to bolster the group.\nWhite House officials also played down the idea that Walsh’s departure was part of a broader restructuring — “No,” was White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s response when asked if a bigger reshuffle was on its way. Still, Walsh’s departure is notable in that she was considered a close aide to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.\n“The move could have significant implications for Priebus, who is losing one of his top lieutenants. ‘He basically took away Reince's political secret service. She was his eyes and ears inside,’ said a source close to Trump,” POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher, Tara Palmeri, Alex Isenstadt and Matthew Nussbaum report .\nTrump officials cast Walsh’s departure as part of an effort to strengthen Trump’s help outside the White House. And it came on the same day the president launched a Twitter attack against the House Freedom Caucus, the conservative group that helped doom the House’s health care bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T02:18:24.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
