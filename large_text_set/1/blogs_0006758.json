So today Facebook is revealing its roadmap of upcoming news features that it calls “The Facebook Journalism Project” to make its commitment to the industry clear. \nThese future launches include digest packages of Instant Articles that users can subscribe to, free trials for paid subscriptions, hackathons with publishers’ development teams, additional Facebook tutorials for journalists, PSAs to promote news literacy and combat misunderstanding of fake news, and more work to prevent hoaxes from spreading. \nFacebook is also now giving away access to CrowdTangle, the journalism tool startup it acquired that helps reporters sift through trends, measure their social posts, and identify sources and influencers. Plus, for the first time, journalists who post from their standard user profile will be able to see basic analytics on the videos they share, like a stripped-down version of the Insights tool offered to Facebook Pages. \nThis initiative could assist publishers with fostering lasting relationships with readers outside of Facebook and avoid getting lost in the feed. Meanwhile, it could help them build new products and open access to tools that aid their teams, while educating the public on how to be good news readers. \nMost importantly, the Facebook Journalism Project could help prevent publishers from being commoditized such that all that matters is the content people consume on Facebook, not who wrote it. \nGiving Publishers Back Their Mojo \nWhen Facebook launched Instant Articles in May 2015, it heralded a way for publishers to beat slow loading times on mobile where users were increasingly reading news. Instead of waiting up to 10 seconds for an outside website to load, Facebook would host the stories inside its own app in a standardized, “readable” format that would load…instantly. \nOn a per unit economic basis, this looked like a big win for publishers. More users wanted to click their stories, and fewer bounced before they loaded. Even if Facebook restricted what could be shown and how many ads could appear in the Instant Articles causing publishers to earn less per view, they were getting enough views to make up for it. \nBut the hidden, second-order effect was that publishers had their identities sterilized. Instead of people reading on their websites with their custom branding, unique visual style, and heavy promotion of their other stories, the Facebook-hosted Instant Articles from different outlets looked largely identical. \nThis deteriorates the connection between publisher and reader, threatening to turn content creators into merely interchangeable ghostwriters. Over time, it could lead people to just haphazardly read whatever was in their News Feed, rather than seeking out certain publishers, visitng their homepages directly, paying for their subscriptions, and attending their events. \nThat’s why two of the new features bolded below from the full list should be the most exciting for the journalism industry: Story packages", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-11T17:08:28.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
