Joyce Overah, says he facilitated the rehabilitation of the Sapele/Eku/Abraka/Agbor Road project when he was in the House and not Hon. Evans Iwurhie currently representing Ughelli North and South Constituency in the House or the incumbent senator representing Delta Central, Ovie Omo-Agege. \nIwurhie and Omo-Agege have been at loggerheads over who facilitated the ongoing project. Overah, who spoke at the weekend, said: “I was actually the person who facilitated it.” \nHe went on: “That project has always been in the budget of the federal government since I facilitated it between 2007 and 2011. The federal government initially awarded it at the cost of N2b and it was to commence at AT&P in Sapele to Amukpe, near Sapele, and to Eku/Abraka/Agbor and end at Ewu, when Uffot Ekaette was Minister of Niger Delta and Elder Godsday Orubebe was Minister of State. \n“As of that time, the project was divided into four parts of N500m each with a promise that more funds would be released to it. I was to supervise from Sapele to Aghalokpe axis, Hon. Halims Agoda to oversee Ethiope West and Ethiope East axis, Hon. Mercy Amonai to supervise from Ubiaruku to Agbor while Hon. Doris Amonai was to supervise from Agbor to Ewu axis.” \n“Unfortunately, it was yet to commence when Ekaette left office and, when Orubebe came in as Minister of Niger Delta, he chose to face the East/West Road first, and left that project. That is how the current government inherited it and since the Delta State government has completed the AT&P to Amukpe axis, the newly awarded contract starts from Amukpe to Ewu.” \nMeanwhile, some residents along the road have erected all kinds of idols and illegal structures along the road with a view to claiming compensation from the company handling the project.
