Her mind swims at a depth most would drown in.” ~ J. Iron Word January 3rd, 2017 is the first full day of Venus in Pisces . \nThis particular transit began just minutes before midnight on January 2nd and will last until February 3rd , which means the first month of the new year is simply all about love. \nVenus is the planet of love, and Pisces is the ultimate lover of the universe. It’s the sign that wholly embodies divine love and one of the most passionate of the zodiac—and now these two aspects have combined forces emblazoning us to feel our way toward the things want most. \n2016 is gone, as are the lessons about love that we’ve all experienced. \nThis is the start of a new year and also a new relationship cycle. We look at love differently, and we know what we want and deserve from a partner—and this time around we just won’t settle for less. \nSometimes the road to love meanders, yet it’s not the speed we travel but the intent behind the journey that has the greatest meaning. \nThere is no set journey to find love. \nThe energy within ourselves has shifted—we now find ourselves believing in that soft, dream-like forever kind of love that only months ago had given up hope of ever finding. \nBut there is a double side to this new energy. Now that we know that we can have anything that satisfies us and serves a purpose. \nThere just isn’t any need to settle for a love that is less than the one we’ve dreamed of. \nIn the past, we easily talked ourselves into loving. Perhaps it was convenient or because we were afraid of the unknown, but the lesson we walked away with is that no matter how much we want a love to work, sometimes it’s just not meant to be. We will begin to feel a rumbling deep inside our heart over the course of the next month. \nWe will be drawn to the exceptional instead of the logical. We will not accept anything less than the soul-shaking love we know exists, because this time we also know that it is exactly what we want. \nIt’s said that we only accept the love that we think we deserve, and perhaps that was true enough for all of us at one point. Once we know what it is we deserve, we simply can’t settle for less. \nThis is the light that will be shining upon our heart during the course of the next four weeks. It’s a prime time to ask ourselves these questions: \nWhat kind of love do I believe I deserve? \nWhat about receiving this love do I fear the most? \nThe biggest obstacle we’ve faced in the past is ourselves, so to find love that is where we need to start. \nWe may not even have to ask these questions because, maybe we learned these lessons last year. \nWe also learned that no matter how much we fear great love, there nothing we can do to stop it from coming. \nIn the past it, was easier to accept watered-down versions of love because we believed it was our only option. Perhaps we stayed in dead relationships or hung on when we should have let go. Maybe it was just that we stayed where we felt safe, even if it meant we weren’t fully alive. \nAmazing love is like seeing the world in Technicolor. \nIt’s passion and friendship, trust and honesty, laughter and tears. It’s quite simply suddenly seeing love as it is really meant to be, rather than what we were told it should be. \nWhen Dorothy travelled to Oz, nothing else was ever the same again, not because anything about her home had changed, but because she had. Once we see love in Technicolor, suddenly we become aware that we’ve only been experiencing it in black and white. \nThis month we will see love in Technicolor and we will not be able to go back to the way life used to be. \nIn order to truly move ahead in this life, we need to be able to embrace each and every situation. This means that we can’t run in fear from what we don’t think is meant for us. We also can’t somehow think that we know better than God or the Divine. \nSometimes love is just about trust. \nWe have to trust that we’ve been guided to where we are, and that the people in our lives are truly meant to be with us. We have to make the choice to believe in love, even when we’ve been given every single reason not to. \nPerhaps love has only been so difficult because we were going against the current and trying to have things be our way. \nYet, all of these realizations occur when we stop trying to fight, and simply let things be. \nThis is the right time to let go of the people and situations that aren’t truly what we want, and in doing so, we will make way for the love we deserve to come into our lives. \nRelationships might be somewhat dramatic over the course of the next month—we can expect fast and sweeping changes. \nYet things around us only change once we do, and perhaps this has the missing piece of the puzzle all along. \nThis is perfect timing to realize just how much we’ve changed, and there’s no need to settle for less than having it all. “Love risks everything and asks for nothing.” ~ Rumi Relephant: Image: used with permission from [email protected] Editor: Ashleigh Hitchcock 23 views hot on elephant", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T21:35:50.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
