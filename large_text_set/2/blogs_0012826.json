Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017 \nIndeed. \nFrom IJ Review : \nFox News reported that the president went to work reviewing the federal court’s decision early Friday morning, and was quick to point out the “per curiam” decision never mentioned one key argument. \nThe lengthy decision at no point mentioned a statute that President Trump has often cited as evidence backing his executive order on immigration. According to Fox News, the U.S. code on “inadmissible aliens” reads: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” \nIt looks like Trump won’t take this to the Supreme Court and will just write a new executive order. \nWho knows though. \nRegardless of what he does, the 9th Circuit proved once again they can’t be trusted to make adult decisions.
