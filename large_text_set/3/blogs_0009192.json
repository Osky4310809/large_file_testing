By: IANS | Lucknow | Published: March 11, 2017 10:57 AM The Bharatiya Janata Party office is just across the road of the sprawling Vidhan Sabha building. (ANI) \nOverjoyed BJP workers, leaders and supporters hugged each other, broke into brief jigs and raised victory slogans in the BJP office here as counting trends indicated a comfortable victory for the party in the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly elections on Saturday. In contrast there was no activity at the ruling Samajwadi Party’s office. The Bharatiya Janata Party office is just across the road of the sprawling Vidhan Sabha building. \nBJP workers raised slogans like “Chappa Chappa Bhajpa”, “Kahan pade ho chakkar mein, koi nahin hai takkar mein” and “Modi Modi”. Some were also carrying posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who most feel acted as the game changer in BJP. The imminent victory is set to end the BJP’s 14-year exile in the state which the party said has been “ruined” by the BSP and the SP in the last decade. \nAlso Watch: \nThere was no activity at the ruling Samajwadi Party’s office at Vikramaditya Marg, which is located just next to the house of former party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, with counting trends indicating a drubbing. The sprawling BSP office near the Annexe, the power centre of Uttar Pradesh government, also wore a deserted look. Congress office at Mall Avenue, which saw limelight return to it after the party entered into alliance with the ruling SP, also was deserted with almost negligible visitors.
