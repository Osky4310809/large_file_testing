If you’ve been on the edge of your seat for any tidbits of info from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, this is your lucky day! Much of the plot of the film has been revealed and we are losing our minds.\nSlash Film released info from their visit to the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. and along with it, a better picture of the plot of the film–which sounds amazing. Here are a few of the basics that you might be wondering about:\nVol. 2 begins just a few months after the first film ended. Why? Director James Gunn told Slash Film :\n“I think because they’re just such fragile egos, and they’re so combustible that this is really the time. I think they’d have problems with each other pretty instantly.” The group is on a mission in exchange for Nebula, which initiates some conflict. The film begins as our Guardians head towards the planet of Sovereign on a mission. The Sovereign people have captured Nebula and are asking for help defeating some power-hungry beasts wreaking havoc on their planet in exchange for her release. You’ll probably be happy to know there will be a lot more Nebula in this film!\nMarvel Studios And then something goes awry. Because, obviously. The team successfully stops the beasts, but Rocket steals some batteries that belong to the Sovereign people, thinking they won’t notice. Yeah, batteries. But guess what? They notice, and are pretty upset by it.\nSo what happens? The head of the Sovereign people Ayesha ( one of the two villains in the film ) sends the Ravagers after the Guardians. Yondu, who happens to be in charge of the Ravagers, tries to convince them to ignore the request. But alas, it’s too late and our second villain, Taserface, leads a mutiny against Yondu and begins to chase after our heroes — driving them each on their own paths throughout the film.\nMarvel Studios Now that’s the set-up. But what else is going on? Kurt Russell is playing a character called Ego — who is probably Peter Quill’s father, right? I mean, that’s what we’re all assuming. Ego comes looking for the Guardians after he heard about their reputation. Along with him is his traveling companion Mantis, who as we can tell in the latest teaser, appears to join the crew!\nMarvel Studios The film also examines the relationship between Nebula and Gamora, who are sisters and were both raised by their abusive father Thanos. See how it’s all starting to come together? But don’t worry, no Thanos this time around.\nThis movie is about family. Between Gamora and Nebula, Peter and his father, plus the family created by the Guardians themselves, the core of the film is family. James Gunn agrees, saying:\n“The first film is about becoming a family, the second film is about being a family.? Will the Guardians reunite? Can they survive this latest challenge? We’ll find out soon enough! Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters May 5th.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:46:37.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
