It all stems from their belief in identity politics really, which is the bread and butter of their agenda. How can they best pander to THIS group or THAT group, always ignoring the individual. \nTake this New York Times opinion piece for example: 21 percent of L.G.B.T. people are or lean Republican.

Almost like they think they should be ashamed of not being Democrats? It’s like they have a right to support a different party or something. https://t.co/gzQSLKiMXS \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 13, 2017 \nHow dare they wander off the Democrat’s LGBT plantation, right? @nytopinion they're thinking independently and free from the constraints of the indentity politics into whch you want them to conform", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T22:19:48.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
