(Picture: Getty) If I had a penny for every time someone has commented on two women or two men raising a child I’d probably be able to live in a castle surrounded by Lego.\nI’d probably be even richer if I had a penny every time someone has commented on two women raising a son.\nBefore our son came along, but even more so now, these comments hurt .\nThey challenge our ability to be parents just because of who we fell in love with.\nThe role as ‘parent’ is about teaching your child how to walk and talk. How to say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’.\nHow to be a decent human being. So how does who I fall in love with effect that in any way? It doesn’t.\n6 reasons why ‘Straight Pride’ shouldn’t be a thing Some would argue that our son is being deprived of a male role model because he is being raised by two women (this argument is often equally targeted at two men raising a daughter).\nTo that I say ‘codswallop’.\nPeople don’t assume children raised by single parents will turn out badly – so why is it different for gay mums and dads? (Picture: Getty) Sure, our son has plenty of male interaction between our friends and close family, but we haven’t pushed those interactions because we’re two women.\nWe’ve pushed those interactions because they’re decent men and we enjoy their company.\nBoth my sister and I were raised fatherless from an early and we turned out just fine.\nPlus, what’s funnier is that my sister and I couldn’t be more different.\nI’m gay, she’s straight. I’m more masculine, she’s most definitely not. I went to college, she went to work.\nI could go on. We were offered the same opportunities by my mum (a single parent) and yet we turned out so differently, regardless of the fact we didn’t have a dad.\nAt the end of the day we grew up to be the people we are because of the parent we were raised by, not the gender of the person we were raised by (this argument often doesn’t seem to apply to single parents, which I’m pleased about, but go figure).\nI’m confident to say that the same will be said for our son, because I can’t think of anyone else I’d like to raise him with than my wife.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T18:37:54.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
