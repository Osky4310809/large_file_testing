Take this teaser image posted by Netflix on Friday, showing a very odd weather report for Houston, Texas this weekend. \npic.twitter.com/WxDgfuxa31 \n— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) February 3, 2017 \n\nSome fans have some wild theories for this, pointing to the dueling 11s on Sunday . Is there a return in store? Is there going to be some sort of clone action? Are our favorite team of child actors going to move on to become the greatest TV weather team of all time? It could be anything except that last one, sadly. We’re sure to get a better hint this Sunday, but fans have also take a simpler route to the secrets hidden within the numbers of Netflix’s tease. \n\nUsing some of that simple math you ignored in grade school, a few fans have deduced that we’re due to find out a premiere date this Sunday: \nSTRANGER THINGS 9/8/17! LETS GO!!!\n— JDE TICSAY (@unojde) February 3, 2017 \nIs Season 2 coming on 9/8/17!? #StrangerThings https://t.co/moKvg2z2dT \n— Tony Mosello (@MoselloATC) February 4, 2017 \n@b_k_t @MaddieMartinez9 @Stranger_Things Look at the temp numbers. 67-58=9, 50-42=8 and if you look at the barometric press, 30-13=17. \n— Amanda Hopkins (@MrsAHopkins) February 4, 2017 \n\nObviously, this isn’t a difficult puzzle to solve if the premiere date is September 8th. It’s far better than just announcing it in some press release and also allows them to deny it ever meant anything if the series gets delayed. We’ll find out the truth tomorrow most likely. \n(Via Daily Dot / Twitter )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:58:11.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
