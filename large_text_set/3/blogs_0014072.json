David Davis appeared to lose his temper at Scottish MP Joanna Cherry \nThe document, authored by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her cabinet, said Scotland was determined to remain in the Single Market - a measure Prime Minister Theresa May has since vetoed. \nPushed to issue a written reply, Davis said on Wednesday that he had “already discussed” the issues raised with the Scottish government. \nHe asked: “You want a piece of paper? The White Paper released by the Scottish Government in December \n“What we’re about is a substantive interest for the people of Scotland, not political point-scoring of the SNP, which is what you seem to try to reduce this process to, which is really rather sad for the people of Scotland.” \nCherry replied firmly that she did not want to “reduce this to a political rammy”, much to the laughter and gentle jeers of other MPs and spectators watching the committee. \nDavis chided back: Well you’re doing very well so far.\" David Davis \nUndeterred, Cherry responded: “Whether you like it or not, the Scottish Government was elected on 46.5% of the vote at the last election in Scotland and has produced a White Paper. \n“I am simply asking you whether your Governments will do the Scottish and Welsh Governments the courtesy of producing a written response. \n“Not whether you agree with it, I’m sure there are many parts you disagree with - and I’d be very interested to know why. ﻿Joanna Cherry asked Davis to publicly respond to the Scottish Government’s White Paper on Brexit \n“But I’m not talking about me, I’m talking about the people of Scotland. Will they be favoured with a written response to the detailed White Paper produced by their government?” \nDavis replied simply that the Scottish government had “already had a detailed response”.
