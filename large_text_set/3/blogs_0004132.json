Precious. #LazioRoma — OptaPaolo (@OptaPaolo) March 1, 2017 \nDzeko headed over the crossbar as Roma quickly sought to level matters, but the first half ended with Lazio deservedly ahead having grown in confidence throughout the game. \nAnderson and Immobile were more involved in the second half and they linked up well to create a chance for Marco Parolo, whose thunderous 20-yard shot whistled just wide of Alisson's goal. \nThe game swung from end to end and Mohamed Salah lashed a shot over the target from an angle after he was put through by Radja Nainggolan, before Immobile had a well-taken goal ruled out for offside. \nGoal-fest but issues persist for Barca \nInzaghi's side continued to probe for a second goal and Immobile was tantalisingly close to reaching Jordan Lukaku's cross after he was released down the wing by Milinkovic-Savic. \nWith 12 minutes left on the clock, substitute Keita beat Kostas Manolas for pace and his cross evaded Antonio Rudiger before Immobile made no mistake from close range, putting Lazio firmly in the driving seat. \nThe late introduction of Roma veteran Francesco Totti, eyeing one last shot at silverware, had little effect and Spalletti's charges have it all to do in the second leg.
