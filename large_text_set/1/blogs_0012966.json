The president-elect said that his new replacement plan for Obamacare would pretty much give insurance to “everybody,” though Trump didn’t divulge details (via WaPo ) [emphasis mine]: Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency — and Twitter — to usher his legislation to passage.\n“The Congress can’t get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,” Trump said during the interview with The Post. \n[…] \n“It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,” Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), to be confirmed. That decision rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which hasn’t scheduled a hearing. \n[…] \n“I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what’s happened in the House in recent weeks,” Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed. \n[…] \n“ We’re going to have insurance for everybody ,” Trump said. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.” People covered under the law “can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.” In 2000, @realDonaldTrump released a book called \"The America We Deserve\" where he advocated for universal healthcare and single-payer. pic.twitter.com/k25Wsawf66 — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) January 13, 2017 \nOkay—a lot of conservatives might get queasy from this. I criticized Trump about this aspect of his campaign platform. Alas, he won. This is what he said he was going to do. And Trump isn’t a conservative; he’s more of a right-leaning populist. That’s fine. At the same time, since he said so in the debates and various interviews, let’s not get all excited that this is some sort of “out of left field” policy change. For quite some time, Trump has been in favor of government-funded health care. He admitted to it on CBS’ Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes in September of 2015 : Scott Pelley: What's your plan for Obamacare?\nDonald Trump: Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced. Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up 40, 50, 55 percent. \nScott Pelley: How do you fix it? \nDonald Trump: There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, \"No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private. But--\" \nScott Pelley: Universal health care. \nDonald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now. \nScott Pelley: The uninsured person is going to be taken care of. How? How? \nDonald Trump: They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably-- \nScott Pelley: Make a deal? Who pays for it? \nDonald Trump: the government's gonna pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything. \nThis was on the docket. So, what about congressional Republicans; they’ve already set the gears in motion for a repeal through the reconciliation process. The replacement is where the real work begins and Trump didn’t go into how he will lobby Democrats to pass his replacement legislation. In the Senate, the GOP needs eight Democrats to defect. That’s a tall order, especially since they’re positioning themselves to block everything on the agenda for the incoming Trump White House. \nFor those on the Right, we’re just going to have to accept that on some issues, incoming President Trump will fit in with the usual conservative mold. He may drift to the left on trade and childcare, though be right with the GOP on taxes and job creation. For those who aren’t so pleased with this shift, they can maybe hope that Trump’s replacement plan mirrors what George W. Bush wanted to do for health care in 2007, which would have reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 65 percent without a mandate (via", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T16:03:44.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
