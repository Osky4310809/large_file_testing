While that percentage may seem small, it’s often the edge athletes need to PR. \nSo here’s where the gum comes in: Not all endurance athletes love coffee or want to wait 10 minutes for a caffeinated gel to kick in. Caffeinated gum tastes like, well, gum and because it doesn’t pass through your digestive system, it kicks in almost immediately, the product manufacturers say. \nWhy haven’t athletes been chewing this stuff forever? Well, caffeine is banned by some associations like the NCAA, and the World Anti Doping Agency only lifted its caffeine-intake limit in 2004. \nBut that’s an elite class of athletes. What about weekend warriors? Do they need caffeinated gum? \n“No one ‘needs’ caffeine,” Smith-Ryan says. “However, it is one of the most effective ingredients when it comes to exercise performance.” \nIf you’re going to chew, make sure to try a small dose first to see how you react. The average cup of coffee contains around 100 milligrams of caffeine. Some brands, such as Run Gum, contain the same dose, but others such as X8 Energy Gum contain about 50 milligrams. \nAlso watch for other stimulants in blended pre-workout products that might over-stimulate your system. No one loves suffering from the caffeine crazies mid-run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:53:30.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
