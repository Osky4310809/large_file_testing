It’s just that finally there are people starting to figure that out.\nThe Orlando Bishop Moore center has been trying to prove his worth among top prospects across the country for three years now. He’s been at the U.S. Army National Combine in San Antonio the past two years. He’s earned honors as top lineman at events such as the FBU Top Gun, where he made the list as All-Top Gun Team Class of 2018 this past summer.\nEric Seidelman, Orlando Bishop Moore, center, 2018 Chris Hays / Orlando Sentinel Orlando Bishop Moore center Eric Seidelman made the Top 5 among offensive linemen at Sunday's Nike The Opening Orlando regional camp.

(Chris Hays / Orlando Sentinel) “It’s helped me a lot,” Seidelman said of the offseason camp circuit. “The more you do it, the better you get at it. It’s pretty simple.”\nSunday, at Orlando’s Nike The Opening Regional, he earned a spot among the Top 5 linemen at the camp. With Sunday’s performance, Seidelman got some big-time attention, showing his skills as one of the top technically sound linemen in Florida.\nHe joined Apopka’s William Barnes, Samuel Baker of St. Petersburg Admiral Farragut, and Georgia product Ruben Unije and Curtis Dunlap, formerly of Jacksonville Ed White, both now at Bradenton IMG Academy.\n“It was very awesome. I just tried to win every rep,” said the 6-foot-3, 285-pound Seidelman. “Being smaller, like me, obviously, you have to be the most aggressive and I try to play that way every single down.”\nHis height is what has likely slowed his recruitment a bit, but he expects it to pick up, as does his Bishop Moore coach Matt Hedrick.\n“He’s just really, really good. One of the best we’ve ever had,” Hedrick said.\nSeidelman has great hand technique and footwork, which allows him to overcome what he might lack in any size disadvantage.\n“That’s what I work on like 24/7,” Seidelman said.\nSo far he has Football Bowl Subdivision scholarship offers from Coastal Carolina and UNC-Charlotte, but he’s optimistic.\n“I’m pretty blessed right now,” Seidelman said. “North Carolina is really close [to offering] so hopefully that will come through.”\nCaption Grading state schools on National Signing Day FSU came out on top while UCF turned in a solid effort.
