Hundreds of whales die in mass stranding on New Zealand beach Read more \nOn Friday morning the department discovered 416 pilot whales had beached themselves at Farewell Spit in Golden Bay at the top of the South Island, with more than 70% dead by dawn. But two additional pods also stranded themselves in the same area over the weekend. \nThe department’s Golden Bay operations manager Andrew Lamason told the Associated Press that he was sure rescuers were dealing with a new pod because they had tagged all of the refloated whales from the first group, and none of the new group had tags. \nOn Sunday 17 pilot whales that were part of a large pod that stranded on Saturday near Puponga were successfully turned around on the high tide and sent back into deeper water in Golden Bay. \nTwo boats were used to guide the whales out to rejoin the original pod, with rescuers hoping that the whales will find a way into deeper, safer waters. Some of the deceased animals have been found with shark bites, and volunteer rescuers have been warned about the possibility of stingrays and sharks. Volunteers try to save whales at New Zealand beach after mass stranding \nHundreds of volunteers made their way to the beach to help the whales, but on Sunday the department said no more volunteers were required, with parking at capacity and traffic jams in surrounding streets. \nThe 240 whales that had stranded between Puponga and Pakawau late on Saturday had mostly refloated themselves on Saturday night’s high tide at 11pm local time and were milling around in shallow water on Sunday. \nIt is one of the largest pilot whale strandings in New Zealand, the department said, with rescuers responding to an average of 85 stranding incidents per year, usually of single animals. \nIt is unclear while whales strand, though possible theories include navigational error, unusual geographic features, illness and extreme weather events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:23:44.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
