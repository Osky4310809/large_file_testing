Stephen Moyer, long of HBO’s hit supernatural series True Blood has been cast in a major role in Fox’s untitled Marvel pilot about kids with mutant powers. In it, Moyer will play a father, presumably of Jamie Chung’s already-announced Blink who reveals she has powers — resulting in the family having to go on the run and join an underground organization for protection and guidance. \nThe official character description is as follows: \nMoyer will play the dad, Reed, an ambitious attorney trying to balance the demands of his job at the DA’s office with his responsibilities to his family.\nThat sounds perilously close to a standard role on a random NBC drama where the romantic lead can’t balance work and home life and has to manage, so fans will have to hold out hope that the comic book origins offer a slightly different angle to the character.\n\nWhile details are still minimal, the show is coming together more and more with each casting announcement. The show will be written by Matt Nix and directed by constant X-Men collaborator Bryan Singer, with characters lifted directly from the comic books. Moyer has been mostly laying low since the end of True Blood , with only a TV role in Kurt Sutter’s short-lived The Bastard Executioner to speak of since that show wrapped. He will also soon appear in the Shots Fired miniseries for Fox.\n(via Deadline )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:36:49.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
