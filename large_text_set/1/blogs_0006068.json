Robben \nAsked about the prospect of a move to the CSL, Robben said: “Everyone has to personally assess this. You must never say that this is not an option. But also do not say that you want to go. \n“I am now at Bayern. Of course, I plan a little, I talk to my wife. I am now at the top level. You must see what comes next. \n“My family comes first, but the life experience, living elsewhere – in the USA, in China – might come. But maybe not. Maybe I’ll go back home [to the Netherlands]. I do not rule out anything. \n“The extension of the contract is not yet an issue. I’m concentrating on the next six months and I want to win the championship. \n“I have no deadline, if it comes it comes. I only concentrate on football. I still have a contract, after that I’ll stay another year, maybe another year [after that].” \nOn when he will finish his career, the 32-year-old said: “I still love to play and have fun on the pitch. If you are over 30, you know that the end comes nearer. But I do not know yet when this will be with me. This may have to be decided spontaneously.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T03:37:48.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
