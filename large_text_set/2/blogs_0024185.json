The iconic pair presented the Best Picture trophy to Damien Chazelle's historically nominated musical La La Land , but as producer Jordan Horowitz revealed moments later – after a round of heartfelt acceptance speeches – the award was intended for Barry Jenkins drama Moonlight .

La La Land 's cast and producers took the stage and began their speeches before Horowitz displayed the winning card to the cameras. \"There's been a mistake,\" he said. \" Moonlight won.\" \nBeatty returned onstage to apologize for the gaffe, which he blamed on being handed the wrong envelope. The actor explained that the saw La La Land star Emma Stone's name on the envelope before handing it to Dunaway, who made the first announcement. \nDespite the error, La La Land still achieved a historic night with its record-tying 14 total nominations. Chazelle's film finished the ceremony with six wins, including Best Director and Best Actress (Emma Stone). Moonlight earned eight nominations; in addition to Best Picture, the acclaimed drama took home Best Supporting Actor (Mahershala Ali) and Best Adapted Screenplay.
