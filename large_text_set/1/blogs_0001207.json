Patriots 8-0 on the road this year, not that it matters playoffs go through Foxboro!! mikeytoth says: Jan 1, 2017 4:01 PM \nGoodell must be livid. Jan 1, 2017 4:02 PM \nFun facts of today‚Äôs game ‚Äì \nBrady surpassed Marino and now is 4th on the all time passing yard list, in Marino‚Äôs home stadium. \nBrady had the lowest INT-TD ratio ever in NFL history in the regular season, 28 TDs and 2 INTs. trainwrecksryan says: Jan 1, 2017 4:02 PM \nmauiraider says: Jan 1, 2017 12:04 PM Sounds like they are looking for excuses of What is sure to be loss to the Dolphins Who will run it all Day! \nRaiders win \nHappy New Year \n\nHappy New Year to you too! Not sure what‚Äôs gonna happen with the Raiders game, but at least we can point and laugh at your Dolphins prediction! Jan 1, 2017 4:03 PM \nLadies and gentlemen, meet Michael Floyd. Jan 1, 2017 4:04 PM \nWow! That looked even easier than I was expecting! \nAnd that was with the Dolphin‚Äôs good QB! \n35-14. That is about how good Miami is. \nOne and done. \nHow sweet was Floyd‚Äôs block on Lippett? \nWhat does Suh have in that head instead of a brain? Whatever it is‚Ä¶.he needs a bigger helmet for it. yankeemofo says: Jan 1, 2017 4:05 PM \nMVP. weepingjebus says: Jan 1, 2017 4:05 PM \nFew things give me joy like watching Jarvis Landry run his mouth while down multiple TDs.

It‚Äôs not that close either. \nAll other opinions are trash. \nSleep well Patriot Hater.üôÇ tigerlilac says: Jan 1, 2017 4:06 PM \nIt is great watching the castoffs of other teams (Blount, Floyd, McClellin) stepping up and enjoying another team win. dontletfactsgetintheway says: Jan 1, 2017 4:06 PM \nI look forward to what excuse the children will make for why the Patriot‚Äôs keep on winning. Don‚Äôt forget, wait till the footballs are properly inflated and you will see how bad Brady really is?? Did anybody notice how the Patriot‚Äôs had headset trouble and it is never mentioned in the media? I forgot, the gatorade was warm for Miami so contact ESPN so they can make up another story on the Patriot‚Äôs! umassdebatingteam says: Jan 1, 2017 4:07 PM \nTaking out the trash. With Pittsburgh being half the team New England is, I expect the Phins to be a 10.5 point underdog.

YouCryin?PatsMustBeDoingTheirJob says: Jan 1, 2017 4:08 PM \nAll is right with the world again. Thanks for laying down mimami. Stadium was half full and it was mostly Patriot fans. As it should be. Back to the kid‚Äôs table. Enjoy watching the Patriots cruise through the playoffs with home field advantage. It may take a little enjoyment out of your super bowl parties, so I advise to take the Patriots and the over. Have a SUPER 2017. michael228 says: Jan 1, 2017 4:10 PM \nFloyds block was savage.
