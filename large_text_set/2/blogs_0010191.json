It’s likely going to come to Negan and The Governor in the end, but past that it’s nothing but fan service. The Governor is dead and gone in both the comics and television series, leaving quite the mark but meeting his doom in the end. He can never face off with Negan , team up with Rick to beat the new foe, and certainly isn’t going to return as some sort of zombie. He’s kicked the bucket and there’s no going back. \nLuckily, we have the next best thing. Thanks to interviews with the men behind the two biggest bads on The Walking Dead , we now know where each stands on the other short of giving them a knife and forcing them to figure it out for real. David Morrissey is on the latest season of The Missing and chatted with CinemaBlend for a little promotion . Now there’s regrettably no questions about Blackpool , but they do ask him for some thoughts about pitting The Governor against Negan : \nI don’t think there’s a world where Negan and The Governor can exist together. I think they would have to take each other on, and you know, it’s obvious that there would be one winner in that, and that would be The Governor. I don’t think there’s any sane person that would argue against that. The Governor is the ultimate villain in the show and there’s been people that have come in and have sort of pretended to be like him, but no one’s ever going to take that crown. And I think Negan certainly isn’t going to take it. He’s bad, but no one was like The Governor.\n\nMeanwhile, over at Entertainment Weekly back in August, Jeffrey Dean Morgan already made his case for Negan taking the crown: \n“It’s not even close,” says Morgan, flashing that devilish grin. “I mean, I love David Morrissey, but he wouldn’t stand a chance. Wouldn’t stand a chance. I’d put Negan up against anybody. He’s super smart and there’s no filter, no fear. The Governor was a little bit wack. Negan’s got it together. It wouldn’t even be close. And I’m sorry, ‘cause I really love David. He’s awesome. I worked with him for a year and there’s just not a better guy. But Negan versus the Governor wouldn’t be close.”\nBoth men are pretty damn sure that their character is the top bad guy in The Walking Dead universe. It doesn’t solve much, but there it’s better than sitting around the living room drinking RC cola and debating it with your friends. I think the folly here is overlooking the true big bad hiding and waiting for those two to take each other out. \nAMC\nYou’re missed you zombie loving freak. \n(Via CinemaBlend / Entertainment Weekly )\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:43:37.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
