It could also be like an Osmosis Jones germ scenario though.)\nThere are even Star Wars references.\nMy personal favorite, though, is turning him into a cast member of Footloose .\nClassic.\nLet’s see what the Timbers come up with in return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T02:35:45.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
