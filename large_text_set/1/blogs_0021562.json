Shortly after the interview, President Donald Trump cited Phillips and his organization in a tweet, who said he looked forward to seeing the final results. Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand. Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017 \nThis evening, Phillips appeared on CNN once again, this time to face off with John Berman, who was filling in for Anderson Cooper. Based on the craziness that witnessed in the morning interview, it was almost certainly a given that this one would be insane. And it was. \nJust like Cuomo, Berman wanted to know if Phillips would provide any evidence, and just like Cuomo discovered, Phillips was unwilling to share anything. “We’re not prepared to release it,” Phillips said. “We’ll get it out as quick as we can.” \nThe CNN anchor pressed Phillips throughout, especially as the supposed researcher stated that the 3 million illegal votes he’s identified are all from noncitizens. After Phillips said “we don’t think so” while arguing with Berman about numbers and percentages, the host shot back. \n“We don’t think so,” Berman stated, repeating Phillips claim, “Do you know so? \nFollowing some more back-and-forth, Phillips told Berman “it’s not my problem” when challenged on why he wasn’t cross-checking his data. \n“You data set isn’t you problem,” a frustrated Berman asked. “But you’re the one producing it.” \nWatch the exchange above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T04:33:26.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
