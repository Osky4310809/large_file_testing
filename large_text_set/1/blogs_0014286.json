From February, that will be in either Ornskoldsvik or Sundsvall - both more than 100km (62 miles) away. \nStina Naslund, who is leading the course, says that she knows many people are anxious about travelling such a long distance through rural areas, particularly in dark winter conditions. \nMs Naslund tells The Local that she wants to prepare people for what could happen. \"Car accidents, the car could break down, you maybe drive off the road. You have to be ready, and the worst could happen even if it is very, very uncommon,\" she says. The training will include what to do if the baby's arrival is imminent, The Local notes. \nThe decision to cut the maternity services in Solleftea, which has a population of around 9,000 people, was part of a cost-cutting measure passed in October, Expressen reports . Mia Ahlberg, head of the Swedish Midwives Association, supports the training but says it's \"tragic\" that it is needed because health services are being closed in small communities. \nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter .
