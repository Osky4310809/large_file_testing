If you’re looking for the wallpaper, it’s actually one image that spans all three displays, and elliotvs dropped the link for it in the thread at the battlestations subreddit (linked below.) Here’s another photo of the whole setup, from the top down: \nElliotvs is a bit of a Steelseries fan, which we don’t blame him for one bit (personally, I’ve used that keyboard, and it’s a good mechanical, and I’m testing out that headset right now.) If you dig the look of the whole thing, head over to the imgur thread below for another shot we didn’t include here, or check out the full thread below to read more Q&A about the setup. Of course, if you do, give him your upvotes while you’re there, and let him know we love his workspace too. Advertisement \nDo you have a good-looking, functional desktop of your own to show off?
