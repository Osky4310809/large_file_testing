I’m a big fan of weird Oreos , but even I am horrified by this violently pink offering. Advertisement \nTheses marshmallow-esque monstrosities aren’t the only—or even worst—offender, below you will find four more stunt sandwich cookies that have no place in you stomach (or heart): Swedish Fish: These things earn the distinction of the first Oreo to ever make me actually angry. I couldn’t even make it through a whole cookie. The waxy, aggressively red, super-sweet-but-somehow-slightly-bitter filling was noxious enough on its own, but when combined with the (flawless) chocolate wafer, the effect was not unlike drinking orange juice directly after brushing one’s teeth. I suggest you only give them a try if you are dead inside and need to “just feel something.” (I also feel personally attacked here because Nabisco took two things I adore and turned them into a grotesque monster that simply was not meant to me.) Watermelon: Unlike the Lemon Oreos—which are the convenience food equivalent of a most excellent lemon bar—these fruity cookies are too creamy to be refreshing, and the barely-there melon flavor gets muted and muddled in the creme. They’re not aggressively offensive in the way the Swedish Fish cookies are, rather I hate that they make me feel nothing . I also take aesthetic offense here; the green-to-pink ratio is all wrong. Candy Corn: Lindy West’s review of the nefarious Candy Corn Oreo is what got me into Oreo journalism, and it still speaks truth. Her review is spot-on, and I can’t really think of a better way to describe the cloying, sickly sweet filling than “an oily strip of clown jerky,” which is food writing poetry. (It should be noted that I hate candy corn in its purest form, so obviously I am not the target demographic of this thing, but I don’t know of a candy corn-lover who’s a fan either.) Peppermint: This may seem a little harsh. After all, chocolate and mint is a winning combination, how bad can these be? It is simply because the marriage of chocolate and mint is so good that I am offended by these. Oreo knows how to do a good mint cookie, for their Mint Oreo Thins are the platonic ideal of such. The filling in their Peppermint Oreos on the other hand has a flavor that resides somewhere between “those weird puffy peppermints” and “toothpaste.” There’s also way too much of it, and it looks kind of like pink slime. Peeps: Full disclosure: I hate Peeps, so I have a bit of a bias. Though they’re kind of fun to look at, the filling is gritty with that crystallized sugar stuff you find on the marshmallow chicks, and after eating two or three of the cookies, your mouth becomes coated with a bright pink film. Luckily, they don’t really taste of Peeps, just one-note sweetness with a slightly sour, chalky undertaste at the end. (They can also affect the color of your stool , which some find off-putting.) \nIf all this talk of terrible Oreos has you disheartened, do not fret, for there are many fine novelty flavors for you to enjoy. Toasted Coconut, Red Velvet, and Cinnamon Bun are all terrific, and I suggest you grab a package or two if you see them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:17:16.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
