Therefore, they must come to us and inform us. If they do that, we can give approval at any time. \n“Once approved, we inform the public that certain companies on certain date or period are having promotions. We must make sure there is no surprise for consumer,” he said. No time frame for companies to submit their applications to hold promotions was provided by the minister. \nMalaysia will soon switch to a new fuel ceiling price mechanism this Wednesday (March 29), where fuel prices will be announced on a weekly basis instead of monthly. Fuel retailers will be able to follow the government-set ceiling prices or set them lower.
