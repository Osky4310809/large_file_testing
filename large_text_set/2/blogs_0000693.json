Trump has repeatedly stated that he plans to eliminate regional trade deals, a move that some market participants fear could serve as a drag on global economic growth. He enacted an immigration ban on January 27, which quickly provoked the reaction of members of his own party. Major Inflows \nAmid this situation, the top 10 money-drawing precious metals ETFs—including Frankfurt-listed Xetra-Gold ETF (4GLD) and Vaneck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ( GDX ), which tracks the stocks of gold miners—attracted nearly $1.6 billion so far in January, Bloomberg reported. Xetra-Gold drew more than $793 million during the month through January 27, data compiled by Bloomberg shows, while Vaneck Vectors Gold Miners has attracted $165 million in January. However, SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) ( GLD ) did not enjoy the same fortune, suffering more than $860 million worth of outflows this month. (For more, see also: The Top 5 Gold ETFs of 2016 .) Potential Headwinds \nWhile gold-backed ETFs seem to be receiving significant tailwinds from concerns surrounding the Trump administration, they might encounter notable headwinds in the form of a more robust dollar and rising interest rates , according to ETFtrends.com. Investors might seek out yield-bearing assets instead of the precious metal should these rates push higher. Some market observers have speculated that the Federal Reserve could increase benchmark rates up to three times in 2017, which could undermine demand for these gold-backed funds.
