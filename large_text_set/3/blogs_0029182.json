Democrats on the committee have asked for a delay in the process. \nSenate Democratic leadership recently vowed to filibuster Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and insisted that if the GOP wants to see him confirmed, they'd have to go nuclear. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said he doubts Gorsuch will get the 60 votes he needs, so if Republicans want to see him on the highest court in the land they would have to change the rules to ensure they only need a 51-vote majority. \nThe vote is expected to take place on Monday, April 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T00:46:58.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
