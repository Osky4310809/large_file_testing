No wonder Ham feels the need to defend the President : \nLeft wing secular media is doing to Trump what they’ve done to @AiG for years–false accusations, lies, misinformation, censorship & more \nHe has it completely wrong, as usual. The “left wing secular media” doesn’t need to create false accusations, lies, or misinformation to make Ham or Trump look bad. All we need to do is rewind the videotape and quote them verbatim. Their words speak for themselves. \nWhen they get something wrong, which happens fairly often, we point out the facts. \nThe concern from the side defending reality is that these people have access to money and power. They have influence. And their actions make our world a shittier, dumber place. What’s amazing is how sensitive they are to the criticism. They don’t respond with rebuttals; they respond with whiny claims of persecution. As if white male Christians never catch a break… \nAt least they still have Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:05:42.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
