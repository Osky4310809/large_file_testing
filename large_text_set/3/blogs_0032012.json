How much more absurd it becomes to believe that the universe, space and time could possibly be infinite when all of us are finite.” How, then, do we set aside this instinctual absurdity in order to grapple with the concept of infinity, which pushes our creaturely powers of comprehension past their limit so violently? \nThat’s what the mathematician and writer Lillian R. Lieber (July 26, 1886–July 11, 1986) set out to explore more than half a century earlier in the unusual and wonderful 1953 gem Infinity: Beyond the Beyond the Beyond ( public library ) — one of seventeen marvelous books she published in her hundred years, inviting the common reader into science with uncommon ingenuity and irresistible warmth. Emanating from Lieber’s discussion of infinity is a larger message about what it means, and what it takes, to be a finite but complete and balanced human being.\nLillian R. Lieber Lieber belongs to the “enchanter” category of great writers and was among the first generation of women mathematicians to hold academic positions in her role chairing the Department of Mathematics at Long Island University. She had a peculiar style resembling poetry, though she insisted it was not free verse but, rather, a deliberate way of breaking lines in order to speed up reading and intensify comprehension. (Curiously, I find her style to have precisely the opposite effect, which is why I’ve enjoyed it so tremendously — it does what poetry does, which is slow down the spinning world and dilate the pupil of attention so that the infinite becomes comprehensible.) \nPopulating her books is the character of T.C. Mits, “the Celebrated Man-in-the-Street,” and his mate, Wits, “the Woman-in-the-Street.” Accompanying Lieber’s writing are original line drawings by her own mate, the illustrator Hugh Gray Lieber. \n\nLieber’s work was so influential in elevating the popular science genre that even Albert Einstein himself heartily praised her book on relativity , yet many of her books have fallen out of print — no doubt because the depth, complexity, and visionary insurgency of her style don’t conform to the morass of formulaic mediocrity passing for popular science writing today.\nLieber frames the premise of Infinity in the charming opening verse — or, as she insisted, decidedly not-verse — of the second chapter:\nOf course you know that\nthe Infinite\nis a subject which\nhas always been of the deepest interest\nto all people —\nto the religious,\nto poets,\nto philosophers,\nto mathematicians,\nas well as to\nT.C. Mits\n(The Celebrated Man-in-the-Street)\nand to his mate,\nWits\n(the Woman-in-the-Street).\nAnd it probably interests you,\nor you would not be reading this book.\nBut it is in the first chapter, titled “Our Good Friend, Sam,” that Lieber’s genius for science, metaphor, and wordplay shines most brilliantly as she takes on everything from the symbiotic relationship between art and science to free will to the vital difference between common sense and truth to the evils of antisemitism and all exclusionary ideologies. (It is self-evident to point out that Lieber, a Jewish woman writing shortly after WWII in a climate of acute antisemitism and sexism, was, like any artist, bringing all of herself to her art.)\nLieber writes:\nFor those who have not met SAM before,\nI wish to summarize\nVERY BRIEFLY\nwhat his old acquaintances\nmay already know,\nand then to tell to all of you\nMORE about him.\nIn the first place,\nthe name “SAM”\nwas first derived from\nScience, Art, Mathematics;\nbut I now find\nthe following interpretation\nmuch more helpful:\nthe “S” stands for\nOUR CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD;\nplease note that\nI do NOT say\nthat “S” represents “facts” or “reality”,\nfor\nthe only knowledge we can have of\nthe outside world\nis through our own senses or\n“extended” senses —\nlike microscopes and telescopes et al\nwhich help us to see better,\nor radios, etc., which\nhelp us to hear sounds\nwhich we would otherwise\nnot be aware of at all,\nand so on and so on.\nBut of course\nthere may be\nmany, many more things\nin the world\nwhich we do not yet perceive\neither directly through our senses\nor with the aid of\nour wonderful inventions.\nAnd so it would be\nQuite arrogant\nto speak as if we knew\nwhat the outside world “really” is.\nThat is why I wish to give to “S”\nthe more modest interpretation\nand emphasize that\nit represents merely\nthat PART of the OUTSIDE world\nwhich we are able to contact, —\nand therefore even “S” has\na “human” element in it.\nNext:\nthe “A” in SAM represents\nour INTUITION,\nour emotions, —\nloves, hates, fears, etc. —\nand of course is also\na “human” element.\nAnd the “M” represents\nour ability to draw inferences,\nand hence includes\nmathematics, logic, “common sense”,\nand other ways in which\nwe mentally derive the “consequences”\nbefore they hit us.\nSo the “M” too is\na “human” element.\nThus SAM is entirely human\nthough not an individual human being.\nFurthermore,\na Scientist utilizes the SAM within him,\nfor he must make\n“observations” (“S”),\nhe must use his “intuition” (“A”)\nto help him formulate\na good set of basic postUlates,\nfrom which his “reasoning powers” (“M”)\nwill then help him to\nderive conclusions\nwhich in turn must again be\n“tested” (“S” again!) to see\nif they are “correct”.\nPerhaps you are thinking that\nSAM and the Scientist\nare really one and the same,\nand that all I am doing is\nto recommend that we all become\nScientists!\nBut you will soon see that\nthis is not the case at all.\nFor,\nin the first place,\nit too often happens, —\nalas and alack! —\nthat when a Scientist is\nnot actually engaged in doing\nhis scientific work,\nhe may “slip” and not use\nhis “S”, his “A”, and his “M”,\nso carefully,\nwill bear watching,\nlike the rest of us.\nIn a sentiment which physicist and poet Alan Lightman would come to echo decades later in his beautiful meditation on the creative sympathies of art and science , Lieber adds:\nSo, you see,\nbeing a SAMite and being a Scientist\nare NOT one and the same.\nBesides,\na SAMite may not be a Scientist at all,\nbut an Artist!\nFor an Artist, too, must use\nhis “S” in order to “observe” the world,\nhis “A” (“intuition”) to sense\nsome basic ways to translate his\n“observations”,\nand his “M”\nto derive his “results” in the form of\ndrawings, music, and so on.\nThus an Artist, too,\nWHEN AT HIS BEST,\nis a SAMite.\n\nPerhaps Lieber’s most interesting, layered, and timelessly relevant discussion is of the concept of freedom, its misconceptions and mutations, and its implication for our private, public, and political lives:\nNow consider a person\nwho is SOMETIMES or OFTEN like this:\nSaM.\nHe is evidently relying very heavily on\nhis “intuition”, his “hunches”, his “emotions”,\nhardly checking to see whether\nthe “observations” of the outside world (“S”)\nand his own reasoning powers (“M”)\nshow his “hunch” to be correct or not!\nAnd so,\nprecious as our “intuition” may be,\nit can go terribly “haywire”\nif not checked and double-checked\nby “S” and “M”.\nThus, a person who\nhabitually behaves like this\nis allowing his “S” and “M” to\nbecome practically atrophied,\nand is the wild, “over-emotional” type,\nwho is not only a nuisance to have around,\nbut is hurting himself and\nnot allowing himself to become\nadjusted to the world he lives in.\nSuch a person,\nwith an exaggerated “A”,\nand atrophied “S” and “M”,\nhas a feeling of “freedom”,\nof not being held down by “S” and “M”\n(“facts” and “reason”) ;\nbut, as you can easily see\nthis makes for Anarchy,\nfor a lack of “self-control” —\nand can lead\nto fatty degeneration from\nfeeling “free” to eat all he wants;\nto the D.T.’s from\nfeeling “free” to drink all he wants;\nto accidents because\nhe feels “free” to drive as fast as he wants\nand to “hog” the road;\nto a sadistic lack of\nconsideration for others\nby feeling “free” to\nkick them in the teeth for “nuttin'”;\nto antisocial “black market” practices\nfrom a similar feeling of “freedom”,\ngiving “free” reign to the “A”\nwithout the necessary consideration of “facts” (“S”) and “reason” (“M”).\nNeedless to say this is a\nPATHOLOGICAL FREEDOM\nas against\na NORMAL, HEALTHY FREEDOM of\nthe well-balanced SAM\nwhich is so necessary in society\nin which EACH individual\nmust be guided by the SAM within himself\nin order to avoid conflict with\nthe SAM in someone else.\nThis is something that\na bully does not understand —\nthat if he acts like a pathological sAm,\nhe induces sAmite-ism in others,\nas in mob violence;\nthis is indeed a horrible “ism”\nthat can destroy a society as well as\nindividuals in it.\nLieber proceeds to build on this taxonomy of psychological imbalances, reminiscent of neuroscience founding father Santiago Ramón y Cajal ‘s taxonomy of the “diseases of the will.” She turns to the next imbalance — the person blinded by isolated facts, unable to integrate them into an understanding of the big picture:\nSimilarly,\nthere is the Sam type:\nhe may be called the “tourist” type —\nrunning around seeing this and that\nbut without the “imagination” (“A”)\nor the reasoning power (“M”)\nto put his observations together\nwith either heart (“A”) or mind (“M”),\nbut is concerned only with\nISOLATED BITS OF INFORMATION:\nhe is like the man who,\nseeing a crowd had gathered,\nwanted to know what happened.\nand, when someone told him\n“Ein Mann hat sich dem Kopf zerbrochen”\n(It happened to be in Germany),\ncorrected the speaker’s grammar\nand said “DEN Kopf!”\nHe knew his bit of grammar,\nbut what an inadequate reaction\nunder the circumstances.\ndon’t you think?\nNext comes the flawed rationalizer, who misuses the tools of logic against reason:\nAnd there is also the saM type —\none who can reason (“M”)\nbut starts with perhaps\nsome postulate (“A”) favoring murder.\nSuch a man would make\na wonderfully “rational”\nhomicidal maniac or crook\nwho could plan you a murder\ncalmly and rationally enough\nto surprise any who are not familiar with\nthis sAM type of pathological case.\n\nLieber returns to the core purpose of her SAM metaphor and its relationship to the central question of the book:\nThus SAM gives us a way of\nexamining our own behavior\nand that of others,\ntaking into account the “facts” (“S”),\nand using imagination and sympathy (“A”)\nin a rational way (“M”).\nAre you perhaps thinking,\n“Well, this may be interesting,\nbut\nwhy all this talk about SAM,\nwhen you are writing a book about\nInfinity?”\nTo which the answer is:\nThe yearning for Infinity,\nfor Immortality,\nis an “intuitive” yearning (“A”):\nwe look for support for it\nin the physical world (“S”),\nwe try to reason about it (“M”), —\nbut only when we turn\nthe full light of SAM upon it\nare we able to make\ngenuine progress in considering\nInfinity.\n\nIn a brilliant and necessary caveat reminiscent of mathematician Kurt Gödel’s world-changing incompleteness theorems , which unsettled some of our most elemental assumptions by demonstrating the limits of logic turned unto itself, Lieber adds:\nThere is only one more point\nI must make here:\nNamely, that\neven being a well-balanced\nSAMite —\nand not a pathological anti-SAMite\nlike SAM, etc. etc. —\nis NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT.\nYou will probably agree that\nit is further necessary\nto have our SAM up-to-date.\nFor he is a GROWING boy,\nand what was good enough for him in 1800\nis utterly inadequate in 1953;\nand unless the “S” is up-to-date\nand the postulates (“A”)\nand reasoning (“M”)\nare appropriately MODERN,\nwe cannot make proper\nADJUSTMENT in the world TODAY.\nAnd ADJUSTMENT is what we must have.\nFor adjustment means\nSURVIVAL,\nand that is a MINIMUM demand —\nfor, without survival\nwe need not bother to study anything\nwe just won’t be here to tell the tale.\nIn a passage of piercing pertinence today, as we watch various oppressive ideologies and tyrannical regimes engulf the globe, Lieber concludes by returning to the subject of freedom, its malformations, and its redemptions:\nAnd so let me summarize\nby saying that the\nANTI-SAMITES\nhurt not only themselves,\nby getting “ulcers”, nervous breakdowns,\ndrinking excessively, etc. etc.,\nbut hurt others also,\nfor from their ranks are recruited\nthose who advocate war and destruction,\nthe homicidal maniacs, the greedy crooks,\nthe gamblers, the drunken drivers,\nthe liars, et al.\n[…]\nJust a word more about\nFREEDOM —\nyou have seen above\nthe pathological idea of freedom,\nbut when you consider this important concept\nfrom SAM’s WEll-BALANCED viewpoint,\nyou will see that,\nfrom this point of view,\nthe “feeling” of freedom (“A”),\nbeing supported on one side by “S”\n(the “facts” of the outside world),\nand on the other by “M”\n(“sweet reasonableness”) —\nis definitely NOT the\nANARCHICAL freedom of SAM,\nbut is a sort of\nCONTROLLED FREEDOM —\ncontrolled by facts and reason\nand is therefore SELF-controlled\n(by the SAM within us)\nand hence implies\nVOLUNTARY COOPERATION rather than FORCE.\nThus anyone who demands\n“freedom unlimited” as his right,\nis a pathological SAM,\na destructive creature;\nwhereas,\nin mathematics\nyou will find the\nCONTROLLED FREEDOM of SAM\nand you will feel refreshed to see\nhow genuine progress can be made\nwith this kind of freedom.\nInfinity: Beyond the Beyond the Beyond is a thoroughly magnificent read in its totality. Pair it with the lovely children’s book Infinity and Me , then complement this particular fragment with Simone de Beauvoir, writing shortly before Lieber, on art, science, and freedom , and James Baldwin, writing shortly thereafter, on freedom and how we imprison ourselves .\nHT Natalie Wolchover \ndonating = loving Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.
