The model took to Instagram to share what looks to be a new cut and freshly snipped bangs, the straight style doubling as a study in geometry. Rather than opting for a blunt length or full-fringe look, Baldwin’s blanched, shoulder-skimming lengths center on angles and lines, with shorter strands framing her cheekbones to highlight-worthy effect. Based on the caption, the new chop likely has roots in Baldwin’s younger years, but one thing is certain: The updated rendition is anything but retro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:19:15.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
