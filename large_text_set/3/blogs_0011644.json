Both noted the progress being made in broadening cooperation,” said presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella. \nWang reiterated his commitment to follow through with agreements made during President Duterte’s visit to Beijing, including that of private-public partnership (PPP) and on trade and investments. \nQuoting the top Chinese official, Abella said the signing of the six-year development program yesterday demonstrates the sincerity of China, which he hoped would result in concrete outcomes. \nAccording to Abella, Wang noted the need to focus on common interests that bring more benefits than differences.   \nHe also said Duterte reaffirmed bilateral ties, which “are found stronger, particularly in trade and commerce, and reaffirmed the importance of peaceful settlement of disputes.” \n“(The President) raised concerns on piracy and terrorism as these affect stability, security and commerce in the region,” Abella added. \nPhilippine economic managers led by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III and the high-level delegation from China also met at the Marco Polo Hotel Davao to discuss recent Philippine economic developments and plans. \nBilateral cooperation on infrastructure, trade, investments, agriculture, fishery and tourism was also tackled. \nThe governments of the Philippines and China, represented by Dominguez and Vice Minister Fu Ziying of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, exchanged letters related to the first two feasibility studies – construction of the Panay-Guimaras-Negros bridges project and Davao City expressway project – of the nine proposed projects that would receive Chinese support. \nNational Economic and Development Authority director general Ernesto Pernia and Fu, also China International Trade Representative, signed the Six-Year Development Program (SYPD) for Trade and Economic Cooperation. \nThe SYDP aims to steer and promote stable and orderly development of economic cooperation, enlarge the scope and enhance the level of cooperation and drive sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development in both countries. – With Christina Mendez  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-18T00:49:24.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
