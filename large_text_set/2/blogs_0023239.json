They are racists,” he said. \nIn a speech at the convention, Schneider said, “They are not an extension of conservatism. They are nothing but garden-variety, left-wing fascists.” \nThe left-wing comment is a head scratcher. It’s almost as though he is borrowing from the classical liberal playbook by blaming all the world’s problems on the left. \nFor whatever reason he said that, he couldn’t be more wrong. \nYet it is ironic that the blatantly racist, homophobic, transphobic, Muslimphobic conference finds Spencer’s views too extreme. Apart from actually using Nazi symbolism, CPAC speakers and Spencer are hard to tell apart. \nEarlier in the day, Spencer said he felt welcomed at the conference, joking no one had punched him in the face.
