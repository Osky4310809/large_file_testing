The Merc With A Mouth made his presence felt at the Golden Globes in the musical or comedy category , but now Fox and Ryan Reynolds have their sights set on Oscar gold . The chances of the film actually leaving the show with an award for Best Picture are very slim, but it’s definitely fun to see a film like this get a nomination in the main category. Mad Max: Fury Road getting a nod last year just cemented how awesome it was, so why not the same for Deadpool ?
