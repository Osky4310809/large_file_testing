Just for fun” and offers the fan the drink — which Sweetin spat into.\n“You’re a wonderfully horrible person,” Sweetin tells Lakin, who agrees: “I know. That’s why we’re friends.”\nHollywood Darlings premieres Wednesday, April 12 at 8 p.m. ET on Pop TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:11:10.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
