korea with modulated red shipping containers jan 19, 2017 URBANTAINER extends the national theater company of korea with modulated red shipping containers \n\nshipping container design studio URBANTAINER has extended the national theater company of korea’s (NTCK) main building with a modular metal addition. founded in 2009, URBANTAINER was originally conceived to fill a gap in seoul’s design scene, and gradually grew to become an integral part of the city’s emerging EDM culture. the extension makes for a slightly more refined project for the company, but the vibrant metal volumes of the new building are no less spirited than their other work. the new building’s various programs include a lobby, place of rest, café and bar. \nfounded in 2009, URBANTAINER was originally conceived to fill a gap in seoul’s design sceneall images by kyungsub shin \n\n\nconsidering the new extension’s functionality as a social space within the NTCK, URBANTAINER’s concept was based on integrating the new space into the existing building structures by unifying the color and alignment of the building axis. while highlighting the modular form of the containers, the design is deliberately light, maintaining a balance with existing features and objects such as a former oil station and central grass square. a wooden terrace wraps around the front of the structure, while full length glass paneling allows a generous amount of light into the building. \nURBANTAINER’s concept was based on integrating the new space into the existing building structures \n\n\nthe overall building was designed with two concepts in mind: ‘module’ and ‘flexibility’. using the modular character of the containers, a 12 meter long open space without interior columns was created. the unique structural benefits of the containers acted as the foundation for realizing the client’s vision for a wide and high space capable of holding large numbers of people. to create a flexible space, moving partition walls were installed creating a dynamic and multi-faceted event area. maximised with movable screens, projector-friendly walls and stage-like elements the extension becomes a theater in and of itself. even the bar counter consists of two sliding doors which can be moved according to space usage. \nthe overall building was designed with two concepts in mind: ‘module’ and ‘flexibility’ \n\n\nthe inner atmosphere is created through the use of light colored walls, giving a warm impression and creating a conscious counterpoint to the bold red exterior. lacquered cement floors give the center a polished feel, and paired with industrial style school chairs create a space that is both formal and relaxed. all graphic elements were inspired by the NTCK symbol, a minimal white rainbow, a
