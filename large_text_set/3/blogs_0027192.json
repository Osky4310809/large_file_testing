Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. \nStarbucks launches a new Mercato lunch menu in Chicago this Spring, starting April 11, which will eventually roll out to other US stores. Zaatar Chicken & Lemon Tahini Salad, Cauliflower Tabbouleh Salad, and Herbed Chicken & Fig Spread sandwich are just a few of the new offerings that frankly sound like they come right out of a high-end Mediterranean bistro. According to a Starbucks rep, the Mercato menu will \"meet a variety of dietary lifestyles, including vegan, vegetarian, and high-protein.\" It's like Starbucks really knows us, am I right? \nCurrently, the menu will only be available at 100 downtown Chicago locations, and Starbucks says leftover items will be donated nightly to local food banks through Starbucks FoodShare program . Though we will have to wait a while for this menu to venture across the States, at least we can try the new Spring breakfast items like the sprouted bagel and avocado spread.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:37:04.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
