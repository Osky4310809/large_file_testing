Live Fight Night International Get Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass \nThe current European titleholder is Spain's Ceferino Rodriguez (24-1-KO12), who recently claimed the vacant strap via a split decision victory, and Malignaggi is hopeful of setting up a showdown stateside. \nSpeaking exclusively to Sky Sports, he said: \"I'm in talks to fight Rodriguez for the EBU title, we are trying to make that happen at the moment and going through the motions - we're in contact with his team. Paulie Malignaggi beat Antonio Moscatielloto to claim the vacant EU Welterweight Championship during their 2015 London contest \n\"We are just trying to figure out the status of the contest and have spoken to the EBU about it taking place in the States. \n\"As long as all the officials - the ref, judges and supervisors - are European then the title can be disputed outside of Europe. \n\"Money is the big bargaining chip and we are just waiting to see if there is more money to do it in the States. If the New York commission cooperates then New York is a big possibility.\" Also See:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T11:31:06.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
