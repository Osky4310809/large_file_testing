The best of Twitter Jamie Vardy says he has 'no regrets' about not joining Arsenal (again). I worked it out, that makes more comments about Arsenal than goals \n— Daily Cannon (@DailyCannon) February 22, 2017 GOAL: Jamie Vardy scores a crucial away goal for Leicester! ⚽️ pic.twitter.com/Yh0JGJv2eH Jamie Vardy has scored his first goal in 748 minutes of football across all competitions. \nHuge away goal. pic.twitter.com/E6RNB55F0u \n— Squawka Football (@Squawka) February 22, 2017 Remember when Vardy, Musa and Mahrez used to run. \n— Miguel Delaney (@MiguelDelaney) February 22, 2017 Get in you beauty. Massive goal for Vardy and Leicester. \n— Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 22, 2017 The year is 2019. \nThe Jamie Vardy movie premiere is taking place. \nIt ends with him getting booed off after a 0-0 draw at Fleetwood. pic.twitter.com/Hu4LpC4k55 Guess that's what happens when you get 'service' Jamie Vardy… has only gone and scored against the mighty sevilla!! what a LAD!! \n— Paul Tooth (@PaulTooth22) February 22, 2017 Vardy scoring an away goal. Like when you're getting bored and thinking of leaving but the host sticks your favourite song on. #VardyParty \n— Football Tips (@footballtips) February 22, 2017 So this season Vardy has only scored vs Sevilla away, (a hat-trick) vs City, at Anfield, vs Swansea & in the Community Shield. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ \n— Nick Sculley (@sculls_6) February 22, 2017 @FOXXXI those are the same idiots who walk how jamie vardy celebrates and think that Drake's one of the greats looool", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:45:12.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
