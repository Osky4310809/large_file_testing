Leaf, a quintessential stretch four. \nLeaf is so valuable to the Bruins because of his versatility — and how he makes UCLA one of the nation’s hardest offenses to game plan against. WEST COAST : Teams back in the mix \n“You can stick him in the post when teams go four guards against us,” UCLA coach Steve Alford said. “A lot of teams can play four guards against you, and the guard might be able to guard that stretch four out on the perimeter. But with T.J., if you go four guards against us, we can post you — and guards can’t guard him in the post. Big guys have enough trouble guarding him in the post. … I think we're almost impossible to — it's really hard for teams to play four guards against us, because you have to put one of those guards on T.J. (because the one big would have to cover UCLA center Thomas Welsh). \n“T.J. is so skilled inside. He's an elite rebounder. His second jump is ridiculous. He handles the ball well, so if he gets a rebound he doesn't outlet it; he can bring the ball up as a point forward. He's so versatile of how we can use him and he's been so efficient for us.” \nUCLA Bruins forward TJ Leaf (22) reacts after scoring a basket against the Southern California Trojans during the first half at Pauley Pavilion. (Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports) \nLeaf, like many kids who fall in love with basketball before a big growth spurt in high school, grew up as a guard, a shooter, a perimeter guy. When he did grow, his father encouraged him to keep that skill set while polishing an inside game to go along with it — even if the inside game felt uncomfortable at first. \nLeaf, a five-star prospect, quickly realized how valuable his blended skill set was during his recruitment. \n“When you can do multiple things like that, it just makes you more of a hot commodity,” Leaf said. \nMORE COLLEGE HOOPS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T00:17:05.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
