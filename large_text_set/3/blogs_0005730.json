I don't want to mention the word, but it falls in that bracket. I would never do something like that on the cricket field.\" \nAsked by an Australian reporter if \"the word\" was cheating, Kohli replied: \"I am not saying that, you did.\" \nSmith's actions were also condemned by former India batsmen Sunil Gavaskar and VVS Laxman. \n\"It was quite blatant and Peter Handscomb suggested to Smith and then Smith asked the guy at the dressing room,\" said Gavaskar. \n\"I don't think that was in the spirit of the game. We have to see what the ICC and match referee do.\" \nLaxman tweeted: \"Really disappointed with the way Steve Smith looked at the dressing room to take a review. Totally against the spirit of the game?\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T19:22:12.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
