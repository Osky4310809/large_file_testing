With such high stakes for immigrant communities, even stepping foot in an airport comes with life-disrupting possibilities.\nWhen navigating such an order, it's important to know your rights. And even if you aren't an immigrant, knowing which rights immigrant communities have during travel is the first step toward being an informed, empowered bystander.\nTo educate yourself on the rights of immigrant communities during travel, check out the resources below.\n1. The go-to travel resource for immigrants Protesting for Muslim and immigrant rights at the White House with the Executive Director of @ACLU_DC #NoBanNoWall #RefugeesWelcome pic.twitter.com/gM9U5UkHUw\n— ACLU National (@ACLU) January 29, 2017\nThis comprehensive \"Know Your Rights\" guide from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) outlines the basic information immigrants need to know when they encounter law enforcement at airports.\nThe resource, which breaks down what to do when being questioned, searched and detained, answers common questions and concerns — without the heavy jargon. Removing that barrier of legal language is a vital part of the guide, allowing anyone who feels at risk to have an essential understanding of their rights.\nThe guide also provides referrals to hotlines and complementary resources for more specialized information.\n2. Resource on rights during detainment Please share. pic.twitter.com/mTT9G4OAXh\n— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) January 29, 2017\nThe simple graphic above from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR), outlining the basics of what to do if you're detained, went viral after Trump signed his executive order on immigration. Along with this abridged resource, the ICIRR has a longer guide, which outlines what immigrants need to know when being detained.\nThe resource says that immigrants should refuse to sign any paperwork without legal counsel, and encourages them to have three phone numbers memorized to be able to reach family and allies, if allowed.\nThe guide is available in both English and Spanish.\n3. Resource on the rights of immigrant children This five year old boy reunited with his mother after being detained at Washington Dulles airport. pic.twitter.com/BhsC8Z1xt2\n— Ben Phillips (@benphillips76) January 29, 2017\nIn the immediate aftermath of Trump's executive action, those traveling from the countries listed in the order started being detained upon arrival to the U.S. One instance included a 5-year-old boy , whose mother was forced to wait hours for him to be released. In the days following, multiple stories of children being detained were reported.\nThis dedicated children's guide, created by the National Immigrant Justice Center, uses plain language to explain to those under the age of 18 what it means to be detained, and what their rights are. The guide was especially designed for unaccompanied minors, who may have difficulty navigating the complicated system.\nThe guide is available in English, French, Hindi, Mandarin, Punjabi, Somali and Spanish.\n4.

The resource outlines what immigrants need to do to assert their rights in a series of simple bullet points.\nAlong with the guide, the center provides an information card that those at risk of being detained can print in advance, and then hand to law enforcement invoking their right to remain silent and their right to a lawyer.\nThe guide is available in English, Spanish, Arabic, Korean and Chinese.\n5. Resource on the needs of LGBTQ immigrant communities LGBTQ people are as diverse as the fabric of this nation & @HRC stands strong with the immigrant community today & every day! #NoBanNoWall pic.twitter.com/qnszjqUDes\n— HumanRightsCampaign (@HRC) January 25, 2017\nLGBTQ immigrants face unique challenges and risks when traveling. Not only can these groups be targeted by law enforcement for their immigration status, but they're often put at risk for their gender and sexuality. This especially includes transgender, non-binary or gender-nonconforming members of the community who have often been flagged for \" anomalies \" when passing through gendered TSA screeners.\nAll of the countries listed in Trump's executive order are regions where LGBTQ people can be lawfully killed for their identities, making the travel stakes especially high for these communities.\nThe National Immigrant Justice Center developed a resource specifically for people who are afraid to return to their home countries due to their sexuality, gender or HIV-status.\nThe resource is available in Arabic, English, French, Mandarin and Spanish. The National Center for Transgender Equality also has a guide , outlining the specific rights of trans and non-binary people — including what to do if the gender marker on your identification doesn't match your gender identity or presentation.\nBONUS: Inauguration crowds were puny compared to Women's March crowds", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/gay-rights/", "https://t.co/qnszjqUDes", "http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2015/12/23/goodbye-anomaly-tsas-new-word-trans-bodies-alarm", "http://www.teenvogue.com/story/5-year-old-boy-detained-airport-trumps-muslim-ban", "https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/825731047723778050", "https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/what-do-when-encountering-law-enforcement-airports-and-other-ports-entry-us", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/TaARwiV6.jpg", "https://t.co/mTT9G4OAXh", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/politics/donald-trump-refugees-executive-order/index.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBanNoWall?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825776702286598144", "https://twitter.com/benphillips76/status/825586382450073601", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RefugeesWelcome?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/ACLU_DC", "http://www.icirr.org/about/get-involved/know-your-rights-and-organize", "http://www.transequality.org/issues/travel", "https://twitter.com/HRC", "https://t.co/gM9U5UkHUw", "https://www.immigrantjustice.org/know-your-rights-manuals-detained-immigrants", "https://t.co/cLo9os9eQE", "https://www.nilc.org/issues/immigration-enforcement/", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/TaARwiV6.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/HRC/status/824378851748888592", "https://twitter.com/chipcoffey/status/825522842297053185", "https://t.co/BhsC8Z1xt2"], "published": "2017-01-31T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T00:34:19.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
