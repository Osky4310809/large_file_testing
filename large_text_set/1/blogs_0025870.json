Henson talked about how the film couldn't be more necessary now, given its emphasis on how to tackle societal problems effectively. \"There's a reason why it was made now and not two years ago, not five years, not ten years ago—because the universe needed it now,\" she said. Henson pointed out how the women they portrayed in Hidden Figures didn't have the benefit of a platform or a voice, and yet they were able to overcome: \"What I admire most about them, and it makes me think about being in the industry: Do not focus on the problems, focus on the solutions. Wallowing amok and talking about the problem is not moving us. What are we going to do to get past this? And I think that's why this film is so timely, because...interestingly enough, it's 1962 again, almost, right?\" But Henson was also choosing to look on the brighter side: \"The beautiful thing about where we are today in 2017 is that the majority of humanity is on the right side of history. So we have to celebrate that, and fear not, fear not. Because if you have faith—fear and faith cannot coexist. You've got to choose your side, pick your battles. I choose faith.\" \nWe're not that damn different. Janelle Monáe, who played engineer Mary Jackson, added some more words of encouragement and hope for the future. \"We've been through more difficult times,\" she said, \"and we got through it back then during the segregation era, and we can get through it now. We just have to remember, in the great words of Kevin Costner [in the film], 'We all pee the same color.' We really do. We're not that damn different. And I mean, that's the great thing about America. We get to come here and be our authentically unique selves…even if it makes others uncomfortable, we will continue to represent those who are oftentimes uncelebrated. These women are finally getting an award. So I dedicate my award to Ms. Mary Jackson, the first African American female engineer at NASA.\" Despite the seriousness of the discussion, Kirsten Dunst and Octavia Spencer managed a laugh as Dunst described getting into character as the terse manager who keeps Spencer's character from being promoted. \"I just pretended my character was very frustrated because she was in love with Octavia,\" Dunst said. \"I turned it on its head, so it felt...uncomfortable, and Octavia was like, 'Just do it, just do it baby, just do it.'\" More from ELLE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T01:58:19.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
