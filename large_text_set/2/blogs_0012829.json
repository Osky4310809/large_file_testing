A video of Itoo being rushed to hospital on a motorcycle has gone viral in Kashmir. \nHe was the second civilian to get killed following the encounter which started at around 11 pm on Saturday and continued till 10 am on Sunday. Itoo died in the district hospital of Anantnag. \n“It is a challenge,” SP Pani, Deputy Inspector General of police, south Kashmir, said, “We have been often warning people not to go near the encounter site, but there is an increase in incidents like these”. \nSunday’s encounter also left more than two dozen people injured, including three Army personnel. Most of the civilians, according to hospital authorities, were injured when forces resorted to firing and shelling to break up protests near the encounter site. \n“We have admitted 20 injured, two among them were shifted to Srinagar and 18 are admitted in our hospital,” Chief Medical officer Dr Fazal Ahmad of district hospital Anantnag, said. “More than a dozen had bullet injuries, around ten youth have received bullet above the waist,” he added, pointing at the violation of Standard Operating Procedure by forces while dealing with such protests. Sunday’s encounter also left more than two dozen people injured, including three Army personnel.

After Burhan Muzaffar Wani's killing, Kashmir witnessed four months unrest in which close to hundred people were killed and more than 12,000 injured. \nSince then, as soon as people get a tip-off that militants are trapped in any place, some from even far as 20 kilometres, rush to these places to throw stones at forces, like Mushtaq Ibrahim Itoo, who was killed in Sunday encounter. \n“We issue advisories from time to time and request people not to come too close to the encounter site,” Rajesh Kalia, the Army spokesman in Srinagar, told Firstpost . “It is only for people's safety. During every encounter, we announce it even on loudspeakers because we don’t want collateral damage”. \nBut in Kashmir’s politically charged atmosphere, such pleas fall on deaf ears as passion in young boys overrides issues of safety, defying reason as well as logic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:52:26.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
