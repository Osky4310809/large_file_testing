Dave East appears on “93 Unleaded.” \nTrigga Trey promised his Tremaine album this year, his first LP since 2015’s Trigga Reloaded . At the end of 2016, he explained the delay between projects to 106 KMEL. \n“Nowadays music is so like fast food, in content in general — not just music,” he said. “Everybody takes everything in so fast and then they’re on to the next thing, so I want to figure out how to hold people’s attention.” \nThe R&B singer also released the Trappy New Years mixtape with Fabolous to celebrate the holiday, but lately has made a lot of headlines for things other than music, including lashing out at a D.C. hotel and trashing the stage at a performance in Detroit. \nTrey Songz’ Anticipation III mixtape stream is above and check out the cover art and tracklist below.
