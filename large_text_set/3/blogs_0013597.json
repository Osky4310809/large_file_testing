Aquarius Mar 14, 2017 11:16 PM \nPlease spare a moment of quiet contemplation: \nWe must pause and have a minute's silent prayer of thanks to the USA \"leadership\" that has sacrificed this once great Nation so that the rest of the World can progress into freedom. The USA has become the greatest martyr for the Freedom of Humanity. \nAs the FedRes destroys its nation's industries, employment, its currency, its credit rating, its integrity, it drives the USA and its people into a devolution of corruption and decadence; it makes a state of Grifters and sleaze street gangsters and a nation of muppets, game and fresh blood for the hunt, of all its peoples so that we may thrive and evolve. Never before in the written history of man has such human sacrifice and genocide been forth coming. This FedRes holocaust has taken much dedication and effort to bring into emergence whereas the Intellectual energies invested in this venture do great credit for those Institutions burnt to the ground for this magnificent end. \nAnd the CIA / NSA and other \"√èntelligence\"Agencies destroy USA Technology gains which have been, until now, unchallengeable; champions of the Epoch; Apple, IBM, Google to name a mere few - and Social Networks, are all being sacrificed to the greater good of global Humanity; such has been the state of USA advances in technolgy, leading the World; until now, to the USA, gutted; finished; a roasted bull. \nWhile those dedicated and loyal political \"leadership\" of the USA, sell off their former Nation to the highest (any) bidder, foreign and otherwise, and kill off their future; their young and able, their nation's only resources, in a continuity of blood sacrifice on foreign shores. Where else to find such selfless piety to Humanity and its evolution; the advance and harmony for World Generation. \nAnd the USA MSM owned by the CIA / NSA publish this Nation's sacrifice in fairy tale stories to deflect this National sacrifice so its peoples do not suffer in the knowledge of their own hard fate. Thier Destiny short lived by the hand of gracious USA \"leadership\". \nAll hail the Martyr. Long live the USA \nA silent Prayer, then, and a tear, as we say Goodbye - so as to show our appreciation and thanks for such unselfish gesture on behalf of Humanity \nAmon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T05:34:27.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
