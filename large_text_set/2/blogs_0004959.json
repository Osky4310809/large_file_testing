Doireann Martin, 6, died after being diagnosed with the terminal tumour (Photo: Irish Mirror) \nMirrorOnline reported on Friday that despite her parents' best efforts, Doireann had died earlier that day, after her brave 14-month battle. \nA family friend said: \"We're just all so sorry and sad today. When it happens to someone so young it's so hard. \n\"The whole community and wider community pulled in together and did their best to support the family in any way we could.\" \nDoireann had undertaken a course of radiation in December 2015, which shrank the tumour and alleviated her symptoms. \nThen three sessions of pioneering convection-enhanced drug delivery (CED) in Germany costing €45,000 also helped to stall the tumour's growth, the Irish Mirror reported. \nHowever, Doireann's symptoms started to return in July - and by August last year she was having trouble walking and had weakness in her left side. \nA subsequent scan showed the tumour was progressing. \nThe couple were told the hospital in Bristol was not taking any more patients, but on January 3 the Martins met CED specialists at Harley Street in London. \nUnfortunately however, the couple were told Doireann was no longer suitable for treatment and there was a rapid growth of the tumour last month. \nJo Bishop, a childhood cancer advocate for families fighting DIPG and a friend of the Martin family earlier posted a tribute on mum Tracy's social media page. \nShe said: \"Beautiful and precious Doireann has passed away. She captured all of our hearts as she fought DIPG. \n\"Please keep her mum, dad and sister in your thoughts and prayers. We are so very sorry Ivan and Tracy Martin #PrincessDoireann.\" \nMirrorOnline has contacted University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust for comment.
