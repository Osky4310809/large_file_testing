What constitutes presence, what constitutes a float, this is all up for conversation.”\nBlack Lives Matter has previously stated that individual officers identifying as LGBTQ should be welcome to march in the parade as individuals, but the issue was not discussed on Tuesday.\nBartleman said the Black Lives Matter demands were not originally on the AGM agenda when it was released days before the meeting, a fact that she and other community members found troubling.\nThe list of nine requests from the advocacy group has been the source of controversy and polarization within the community since the 2016 Pride parade, during which the group staged a half-hour sit-in to present their list of demands.\nRelated BLM co-founder says ‘serious allegations’ against ex-Pride Toronto director not surprising Pride Toronto head steps down in wake of heated dispute with Black Lives Matter Barbara Kay: In BLM’s view to be white is to be racist and to be black is to be a victim Christie Blatchford: Gay police officers shunned in Toronto Pride grievance politics squabble The parade ground to a halt and only resumed when Pride Toronto’s then-executive director Matthieu Chantelois signed the list of demands. He later told the media that he only did so in order to get the event moving again.\nChantelois resigned about a month later amid allegations of racism and harassment in the workplace, but the issue did not die with his departure.\nPride Toronto issued an apology in September for what it described as a “history of anti-blackness” and “repeated marginalization of the marginalized,” pledging at that time to honour the promises made to Black Lives Matter.\nBartleman said she and other members helped push the item on the agenda to ensure this promise was kept.\nShe said the meeting chair initially resisted efforts to add the motion, which simply stated that Pride should adopt eight of the nine demands. One, a request to hold a town hall meeting, was dropped because it had already been fulfilled.\nBartleman said she and other members officially challenged the chair and had the item added, saying it received “overwhelming” support from what she estimated to be hundreds of people in the room.\nBartleman said championing the Black Lives Matter demands seemed a natural extension of her advocacy on behalf of the LGBTQ community.\n“The Black Lives Matters issues and demands are queer demands,” she said. “There’s no separation for me between that.”\nShe said the police force is not supportive of the community at large and said people still don’t view police as allies.\nBut Pugash said the force is actively working to strengthen ties with the community and said Tuesday’s vote will not change those efforts regardless of how it’s implemented.\n“We’ve made great progress,” he said. “We know we still have a lot more to do, but we’re particularly interested in reaching out to groups that feel marginalized.”\nSocial media teemed with negative reaction to Tuesday’s vote, criticizing Pride Toronto for ostensibly abandoning its philosophy of inclusion by banning police.\nSome referenced an open letter from Toronto Const. Chuck Crangle, who is openly gay and decried any move to leave his employer out of the parade.\n“Police officers are significantly represented in the LGBTQ community and it would be unacceptable to alienate and discriminate against them and those who support them,” he wrote. “They too struggled to gain a place and workplace free from discrimination and bias.”\nBut others felt Pride Toronto was not abandoning its roots.\nRem Zelaya, 26, attended the AGM and voted in support of the motion.\n“Being inclusive doesn’t mean having to have every service organization or corporate sponsor in the parade,” he said. “Police services are not a marginalized group. I don’t see the need where they have to be represented in that way.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:46:18.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
