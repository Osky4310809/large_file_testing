The report divides the nations into four categories with the top 51 countries with very high human development, 54 with high human development, 32 with medium human development and 41 with low human development. India was placed in the third category.\nThis puts India below two of her neighbors and above the rest. Among neighbors Sri Lanka and China are at the top with the rankings at 73rd and the 90th rungs. Other neighbors ranked below India are Bhutan (132), Bangladesh (140), Nepal (144), Myanmar (146), and Pakistan (147). India was however ranked the lowest among Bric countries with Russia and Brazil ranked 49 and 79 respectively.\nBut what makes India’s position rather grim is that though India has improved on its HDI rankings by 4 rungs in the 2010-15 period the growth of India’s HDI scores has been slower than many of her neighbors. While India’s index went up at an annual rate of 1.52% in the last 25 years that of Bhutan went up by 1.64%, Bangladesh by 1.57%, Nepal by 1.83% and China 1.57%. Only Myanmar and Sri Lanka fared worse than India with the growth rates being only 1.24% and 0.85%.\nThe other issue is that India’s HDI ranking is 4 rungs lower than its per capita income rankings measured on a PPP scale. Bhutan. Myanmar, Pakistan and China also suffered similarly. However, in case of Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka their HDI rankings were substantially higher than their per capita income rankings.\nA major factor that is dragging down India’s development indicators is the huge gender inequalities. India was ranked 125 in case of gender inequality which is only surprassed by Pakistan in the neighborhood with its ranking at 130. China was on the other hand ranked 37,Myanmar 80, Sri Lanka 87, Bhutan 110, Nepal 115 and Bangladesh 119. Other Bric countries like Russia and Brazil had a higher ranking of 52 and 92 respectively.\nOne reason for the huge gender inequality is the lack of empowerment of women which is also reflected in women’s representation in parliament. Women’s representation in India parliament was only 4.9%, which is almost the lowest among its neighbors the only exceptions being Sri Lanka and Bhutan where the representation was only 4.9%. In contrast women’s representation was 13% in Myanmar, 20% each in Bangladesh and Pakistan, 23.6% in China and 29.5% in Nepal.\nAnother major factor impacting on human development indicators in India is the large share of people living at less than $1.90 per day. While the share of such people in India was 21.2%, which is only slightly lower than the 22% share in Bhutan. The share of such poor people in the other neighboring nations was 18.5% in Bangladesh, 15% in Nepal, 6.1% in Pakistan and a bare 1.9% in China\nHowever, some factors will help India in the long run. One is the high years of schooling. The average years of schooling in India is 6.3 years which is marginally lower than the 7.6 years clocked by China. This is higher than the Bhutan (3.1), Bangladesh (5.2), Nepal (4.1), Myanmar (4.7), Pakistan (5.1) but lower than that of other Bric countries like Brazil (7.8) and Russia (12).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T09:53:32.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
