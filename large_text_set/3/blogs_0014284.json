Commencing in 2018, London-based tour operator Blue Marble Private will run eight-day journeys to offer guests an up-close encounter with the ship that currently rests at a depth of 13,000ft.\nBut not everyone will be lucky enough to get their names on the list – as the tour will only be open to nine people at a time, and it works on a first come, first serve basis.\n(Picture: Getty) But if you are one of the lucky nine, you will have a truly incredible time.\nNot only will customers be able to get up-close to the ship, which measured more than 800ft long and 100ft tall, and went down with the devastating loss of 1500 lives on 15 April, 1912, groups will begin their experience by flying by helicopter or seaplane from St John’s, Newfoundland, to the expedition support yacht set above the wreck.\nThere, the group will be educated about the ship’s workings – with those wanting to get involved a little more having the opportunity to take part in orientation and to also help assist the crew in planning a dive.\n(Picture: Getty) Dives will take place both day and night, but they won’t just be simple, float-under-water experiences.\nCustomers will be given set tasks to complete while down under, after having listened to mission updates and dive briefs from deep ocean explorers, to help provide them with a deeper appreciation of the efforts required to even make the dive possible.\nOn the third day of the trip, leading up to the sixth, three passengers at a time will be able to clamber aboard a specially designed titanium and carbon fibre submersible to see the remains of the Titanic up-close and personally – something some people can only dream of doing.\n(Picture: Getty) Not only will anyone who manages to fill a group spot have a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but their place will also go down in history as this is the first time since 2005 that it has been possible for the public to dive to the site of the Titanic.\nYes, it all sounds amazing, but everything amazing comes at a price. And we’re afraid that this trip comes at a large one.\nSeriously, brace yourself, people.\n(Picture: Getty) Braced?\nHolding your breath?\nYou should be, because this trip-of-a-lifetime will set you back £86,500.
