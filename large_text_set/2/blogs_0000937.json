And what he just posted Wednesday night has everyone thinking a Too Faced holographic palette could possibly be in the works. Yes, seriously. Blandino, who—ICYMI—is the brand's co-founder, shared what looks like two arms (his own?) with 12 different shades of some kind of product swatched on them. It could be eyeshadow, or cream highlighter, or eye pigments (like these Milk Makeup ones I'm obsessed with.) We don't really know what it is. What we do know, is that they are shimmery and pastel and seriously pretty. They resemble the Kat Von D Alchemist Palette a bit. Many Instagram users agree. \"Highlights or tinted pigments like the alchemist palette,\" wrote @kristinaa.jaii. Many think it's a highlighter palette, but we're thinking Too Faced has enough highlighters and this launch is going to be bigger than that. Whatever the product is, it's obviously a work in progress. Insta user @baddieasfmakeup said basically just that. \"The top arm is to die for the bottom arm swatches look a bit shady but hey it's a process lol,\" she wrote.
