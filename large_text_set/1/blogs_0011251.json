And, as any local might well tell you, bullfighting is a Spanish thing , and 'Catalonia is not Spain'. Though there will no doubt be a rush of people wanting to see a fight there before the ban comes into effect, should you really be going to see something the locals are opposed to? \nInstead: Do anything else. Like something from our Top 100 Things to Do in Barcelona \nThere are also plenty more places to see Bullfighting in Spain . \nRead more on the Barcelona Bullfighting Ban \ncontinue reading below our video Long-Haul Flight Survival Tips Only Ryanair says Girona and Reus are in Barcelona. Image: (c) Damian Corrigan 2. Mistake Girona or Reus For Barcelona Airport \nCountless people fly to Barcelona Girona and Barcelona Reus each year not realizing they're both miles away from Barcelona. Doh! (In fact, it's only Ryanair that describes these airports as 'Barcelona' airports ). They're both cities in their own right in their own separate provinces. Each is an inconvenient hour-long bus ride away. \nInstead: Fly direct to Barcelona, or fly to Girona or Reus but check out the local area first. \nRead more on Ryanair Flights to Barcelona \nOh, and while we're on the subject of flying: don't assume that flying is always the quickest way to get to, from and around Spain. Often it'll be the train! Read more about the AVE Train in Spain or check train times and book tickets . La Sagrada Familia - better from the outside. Image: (c) Damian Corrigan 3. Feel You HAVE to Go Inside The Sagrada Familia \nIt's much more interesting from the outside. The views aren't among the city's best. Most of the building is under construction. And you'll be saving 12â‚¬. \nInstead: For good views of Barcelona, go up the Columbus statue at the bottom of the Ramblas. Barceloneta Beach. Image: (c) Damian Corrigan 4. Head to the Nearest Beach \nUnless you like cigarette butt-infested, concrete sand, scummy water with plastic bags floating around in it and hordes of boisterous beer-swilling tourists, don't go to Barceloneta beach .But that doesn't mean there isn't anything to do in Barceloneta . \nInstead: You're better off taking a short train ride to Ocata or St Pol de Mar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-15T02:31:06.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
