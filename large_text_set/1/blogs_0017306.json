John McCain CBS News \nOne of the Senate’s most prominent Russia hawks, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, told “CBS Evening News” anchor Scott Pelley on Wednesday that he was still undecided on whether to support Tillerson’s nomination. See who President-elect Donald Trump wants in his inner circle at the White House \n“I have concerns. And I have had several conversations with him.
