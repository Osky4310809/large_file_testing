Or do they? \nJamie Canning has never been able to figure out how he lost his closest friend. Four years ago, his tattooed, wise-cracking, rule-breaking roommate cut him off without an explanation. So what if things got a little weird on the last night of hockey camp the summer they were eighteen? It was just a little drunken foolishness. Nobody died. \nRyan Wesley’s biggest regret is coaxing his very straight friend into a bet that pushed the boundaries of their relationship. Now, with their college teams set to face off at the national championship, he’ll finally get a chance to apologize. But all it takes is one look at his longtime crush, and the ache is stronger than ever. \nJamie has waited a long time for answers, but walks away with only more questions—can one night of sex ruin a friendship? If not, how about six more weeks of it? When Wesley turns up to coach alongside Jamie for one more hot summer at camp, Jamie has a few things to discover about his old friend… and a big one to learn about himself. \nWarning: contains sexual situations, skinnydipping, shenanigans in an SUV and proof that coming out to your family on social media is a dicey proposition. \nTitle: Us (Him Series Book #2) Author: Sarina Bowen & Elle Kennedy Genre: Contemporary Romance, M/M \n\nCan your favorite hockey players finish their first season together undefeated? \nFive months in, NHL forward Ryan Wesley is having a record-breaking rookie season. He’s living his dream of playing pro hockey and coming home every night to the man he loves—Jamie Canning, his longtime best friend turned boyfriend. There’s just one problem: the most important relationship of his life is one he needs to keep hidden, or else face a media storm that will eclipse his success on the ice. \nJamie loves Wes. He really, truly does. But hiding sucks. It’s not the life Jamie envisioned for himself, and the strain of keeping their secret is taking its toll. It doesn’t help that his new job isn’t going as smoothly as he’d hoped, but he knows he can power through it as long as he has Wes. At least apartment 10B is their retreat, where they can always be themselves. \nOr can they? \nWhen Wes’s nosiest teammate moves in upstairs, the threads of their carefully woven lie begin to unravel. With the outside world determined to take its best shot at them, can Wes and Jamie develop major-league relationship skills on the fly? \nWarning: contains sexual situations, a vibrating chair, long-distance sexytimes and proof that hockey players look hot in any shade of green. \nWes is absolutely adorable…I love his note! Keep reading to see the full Love Note! \nBabe– I followed all the guys into a card shop in Boston last week, because somebody realized that Valentine’s Day was around the corner, and none of ‘em wanted to be in the doghouse. So I started looking at cards just to pass the time. I’d never bought anybody a Valentine before. There were some surprisingly queer-friendly choices. There is this one that says on the cover, “I love your face.” And when you open it: “Also, your butt.” Tell me that’s not gay? C’mon. So then I found this one with the snuggling cats on it. And, as you now know, the inscription is, “I want to spend all my lives with you.” Insert the eyeroll, right? Well. It was time to go, so I got in line with the other guys and bought this card as a lark. I thought I’d give it to you ironically, because Valentine’s Day is for saps and men who need a piece of folded paper to make the wife happy. Only here I am on Valentine’s Day, writing this out before I leave for the morning skate. And you’re still asleep in our bed, your face in the pillow. You look as snuggly as the cats on this card. And all I want to do is climb back into bed and hold you until you wake up and kiss me. Yeah, okay. So it turns out this card isn’t ironic at all. Guess I’m not the hipster I thought I was. I love you, and I do want to spend all my lives with you. If that makes me a sap, I guess I can’t help it. Happy Valentine’s Day, Jamie. I’ll be collecting my kisses later. Love you,", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:48:08.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
