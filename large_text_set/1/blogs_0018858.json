This move follows the growing requests of users and developers alike on social media and forums, along with our own request to OnePlus to comply with the GPL V2 license that governs the distribution of the Linux kernel.\nOnePlus had released the kernel sources for the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T right around the time the devices went on sale respectively. But these sources were outdated owing to the release of Android Nougat update that the company rolled out in the form of OxygenOS 4.0 for each of the phones. Now that kernel sources for the same have been updated, we can expect to see more development on custom kernels that work in harmony with the latest OxygenOS based on Nougat.\nYou can find the kernel sources on OnePlus’s GitHub .\nWhile a very good move indeed from OnePlus, it is not entirely without faults. XDA Recognized Developer franciscofranco mentioned a few in his statement shared with XDA , and some of them still carry on with this release. The modifications released this time follow along the pattern of one huge commit to push all the changes. This means that developers will need some time to sort through the changes to understand the impact of each of them. So while custom kernels will eventually come around, you may need to wait for your developer to familiarize himself with the newest sources.\nNonetheless, we commend OnePlus on releasing the sources for their devices. It is better late than never, and we do hope they make an active effort in keeping the code regularly updated following along the frequent software updates. Perhaps, pick up on some of Franco’s advice too?\nWhat are your thoughts on the kernel source release? Let us know in the comments below! \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T16:09:59.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
