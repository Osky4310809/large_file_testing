It is a long-term injury, 10, 11, 12 months. \n\"He will come back, he has a strong mentality.\" \nBolasie impressed at Goodison Park having signed from Crystal Palace in August – a deal reported to be worth in the region of £27million. \nHe scored his maiden Everton goal at Burnley in October and has supplied four assists in 13 Premier League appearances.
