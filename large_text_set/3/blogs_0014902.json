By Jackie Renzetti Star Tribune March 20, 2017 â€” 11:27am Purchase: Order Reprint Spring has sprung and to celebrate, Dairy Queen is serving up free ice cream Monday. The Edina-based ice cream chain will give customers one free, soft-serve vanilla cone at participating, non-mall locations. The event is also a fundraiser for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and customers are encouraged to make a donation. It is the third time Dairy Queen has held the promotion, dubbed \"Free Cone Day.\" In 2016, more than $200,000 was raised for the nonprofit, which raises funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals. Over the last 32 years, Dairy Queen has raised more than $120 million for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, according to a news release.
