Fred would say, 'On ' The Last Journey Home ' [off 2008's ' Ultra Beatdown '] - that is wrong.' He tells us stuff like that or 'That's not the right chord with those notes.' \n\"I go, 'No one complained on the album so we should keep playing it wrong live' and he goes, 'No, we shouldn't.' \n\"I say, 'It's my sound,' so it's kind of a weird thing. I don't just play all the solos and say that's it. I do let people give me an opinion. \nFocusing on the quality of studio recordings, Mr. Li noted: \"You can always do better but the problem is what is better? It's hard to say. You listen to some albums and it's not perfect and you go, 'That√≠s amazing.' You do perfect stuff and say, 'That sounds boring.' \n\"That's the problem with music - it's so subjective and the feeling and all that is very different. You listen to it tomorrow or the next day and you go, 'Oh, that's actually fine.' Personally, I have a different attitude now. I just say, 'Eh.' I don't really get frustrated, I just do it again until it sounds right.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T04:22:58.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
