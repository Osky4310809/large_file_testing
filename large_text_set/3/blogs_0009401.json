He’s been sitting in Ohio’s Franklin County Dog Shelter & Adoption Center with a stuffed gray elephant toy, which was left with him when his original owners dropped him off, according to The Dodo . He got so attached to the toy, that a sign hung on his kennel read the dog and toy must leave together. \nSmokey was scared in the shelter, so much so that the staff noticed he had started growling in his kennel. They knew he needed a different environment, so they put out word that he needed a foster home.

Since the original owners only gave him up because they lost their home, he will be offered back to his family first. If not, he’ll finally be leaving the shelter regardless. \nThe organization hopes Smokey’s popularity will encourage people to adopt from shelters. Hoping to invest in a new best friend?
