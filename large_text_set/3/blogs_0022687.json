Why does that matter?\nWell how about this, an average of 663 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean water.\nThis cancer survivor has been collecting 'Bald Buddies' to try and normalise being bald We’re all sitting here getting miffed that we’ve only got 13% battery left on our phone, and around the world, many people don’t have access to indoor plumbing, let alone clean water.\nI’m not trying to make you feel guilty, first world problems are still problems. What I’m saying, is they often distract us from the fact that we are really f*cking lucky to have so many basic human needs on tap, quite literally in the case of fresh water (your views on the quality of London water being ‘fresh’ aside).\nThis water bottle is helping to remind us of what we’re so lucky to have by making clean spring water look downright filthy.\n\nOne Water has developed a worthy sleeve for its bottles which make the clean spring water inside look filthy, all to coincide with World Water Day.\nYou’ve probably seen One Water bottles at Starbucks, and given that the British population consume close to 4.8 billion litres of bottled water per year, you’ve probably even bought one yourself.\n\nDuncan Goose, who founded One Water, said he took these figures and wanted to use them make the world a better place.\n‘I wanted to turn this into a force for good – a source of funds that benefits the billions of people worldwide who don’t have a reliable clean water source.\n‘It seems counter-intuitive to be trying to sell a bottle of water that looks dirty, but we think it’s a useful moment of reflection in our busy days and an opportunity to support a business that pours its profits into clean water for everyone rather than into the bank accounts of corporations.’\nVersions of the new bottles are being trialled now and you could start to see them in major supermarkets soon.\nRegardless, there’s not doubt you won’t be looking at your water bottle the same way after seeing those pictures.\nFor more information on World Water Day, click here .\nMORE: UN World Water Day 2016: What is it and why is it important? \nMORE: World Water Day – what is it and why is it important?
