Thorburn / Wikipedia A 1920 illustration of a narwhal and a beluga, its closest living relative Extensive year-round sea ice once limited the number of killer whales in those waters. The decline of that ice due to global warming means killer whales arrive earlier, leave later, and are greater in number.\nFerguson and his colleagues used telemetry to track a pod of killer whales and a number of narwhal over an 18-day period in the vast inlet, which is 300 kilometres long and 50 kilometres wide.\nWhen killer whales weren’t around, the narwhal went after abundant shoals of prey fish between four and 10 kilometres from shore. But when the orcas were anywhere in the inlet, narwhal cowered within 500 metres of shore.\n“I think the narwhal are scared to death,” said Ferguson. “Watching your brother or sister or mother get killed and eaten by a killer whale would cause a little post-traumatic stress in most of us.”\nFerguson has a theory on how the narwhal know.\n“Killer whales are quiet,” he said. “They almost don’t communicate while they’re hunting.\n“But once they make a kill, they tend to celebrate and make a lot of noise. And quite likely, in the chase, the narwhal are able to communicate and somehow this gets passed on down through the different groups.”\nThe predation drives the narwhal from their richest feeding grounds.\nOnce they make a kill, they tend to celebrate and make a lot of noise\nThe killer whales also arrive at a time when the narwhal are trying to raise young. Part of the reason narwhal gather in Admirality Inlet is the protection it once offered.\nHugging the shore also exposes them to Inuit hunters for whom narwhal is a valued food.\n“The hunters love it,” said Ferguson.\nThose factors add stress to an already difficult environment. It’s an example of how a small change in the food web can have impacts far beyond the number of narwhal killed.\nAlistair Brightman / Getty Images A file photo of a pod of killer whales Killer whales may be having a similar effect on other Arctic species. Preliminary data suggests bowhead whales seek refuge from killer whales by heading to the centre of areas where sea ice remains.\n“They lie quiet,” Ferguson said. “That seems to be a good tactic to evade predation for them. The killer whales don’t like ice.”\nFerguson suggests the paper challenges notions on environmental change.\n“Most traditional science views changes to occur from the bottom up — the food supply changes and it ripples its way up the food web. A few of us believe the changes can happen from the top down and be just as significant.”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:45:46.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
