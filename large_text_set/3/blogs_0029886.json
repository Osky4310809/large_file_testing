Lincoln brings so much to the story, from his charming British accent, to the hand gestures, to the overcooked Caaarrrool . It is absolutely magnificent, and maybe the funniest I have ever seen Andrew Lincoln. The audience at Paleyfest is clearly eating up every word, because it is a majestic tale of tragedy, comedy, heroism, and the twist ending the series desperately needs.
