Click. Shoot. Repeat.” \nOver the years, smartphone cameras have progressed so much that the need to carry a standalone camera continues to diminish day by day. While they still can’t replace professional DSLRs, phones are now certainly capable of handling casual shooting. In fact, this year, devices like the Google Pixel XL , Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus have established new benchmarks when it comes to smartphone photography. But that’s not to say that affordable handsets don’t offer impressive images. Let’s take a look at some budget smartphones which can prove to be a delight for shutterbugs, all priced below Rs 15,000. Honor 6X \nHuawei has been making some promising strides in the photography department and its sub-brand Honor can be seen doing the same. The company launched the dual-camera toting Honor 8 smartphone in the flagship killer segment last year which got rave reviews about its cameras. Now, Honor has followed that up with the recently launched Honor 6X budget smartphone, which also features dual-cameras on the back. Coming to the specs of the device, buyers get a pair of 12MP and 2MP sensors on the back, along with an 8MP selfie shooter up front.The camera app is fairly minimal and easy to use and comes with a dedicated Pro photo and Video mode.

Lenovo PHAB 2 Plus \nLenovo’s latest phablet, the PHAB 2 Plus , comes with everything a photography enthusiast might need. In fact, what the PHAB 2 Plus brings to the table isn’t something many of its rivals can boast about – a dual-camera setup in a smartphone that costs just Rs 14,999. Yes, you read it right. The PHAB 2 Plus rocks a 13MP dual rear camera setup with f/2.0 aperture, laser autofocus, phase detection autofocus, and a dual-LED flash. Lenovo has also included an augmented reality mode in the main camera that lets you create photos and videos with superimposed effects like virtual backgrounds or cartoons.

It’s armed with a 16MP Omnivision sensor with autofocus and dual LED flash, as well as features like face detection, slow-mo videos, and a pro mode. The primary camera is aided by a 5MP front shooter for selfies and video calling. In our review , we found the cameras of the Moto G4 Plus to be pretty impressive, to say the least. Even the camera app is well laid out and simple to use. Other specifications of the device include a Snapdragon 617 SoC, up to 3GB of RAM, and up to 32GB of internal storage. Coolpad Cool 1 Dual \nThe Cool 1 Dual is the fruit of a collaboration of two of the biggest Chinese tech brands- Coolpad and LeEco. The USP of the Coolpad Cool 1 Dual is its rear-facing camera, or should we say cameras as the device comes with two 13MP sensors on the back. This, along with the smartphone’s competitive pricing makes it one of the best pocket shooters available in the market right now. As for the front facing camera, Coolpad has furnished the Cool 1 Dual with an 8MP sensor. Some other specs of the device include a 5.5-inch full HD display, a Snapdragon 652 octa-core processor along with a beefy 4,000mAh battery. nubia Z11 mini \nThe ZTE nubia Z11 mini has all it takes to be a solid option in the budget segment. A 5-inch full HD display, Snapdragon 617 SoC, 3GB of RAM, a 2,800mAh battery with fast charging, and the next-gen USB Type-C port… you name it, and the Z11 Mini has it. While it may have “mini” in the name, the camera performance is something that can give its rivals a run for their money. Boasting a 16MP Sony IMX298 sensor at the back, the phone features phase detection autofocus as well as 3D noise reduction. The company hasn’t compromised with the front camera, as it comes with an 8MP sensor, enough to take some well-detailed selfies. If initial impressions are to be believed, the nubia Z11 Mini is one of the best camera smartphones under Rs 15,000.
