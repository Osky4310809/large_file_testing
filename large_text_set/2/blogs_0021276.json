As for Trump, the president had this to say in response: Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nBased on the last part of Trump’s tweet, there’s reason to believe that Trump’s comments were a bit tongue-in-cheek. Perez took it in stride, however, based on his reply: Call me Tom. And don’t get too happy. @keithellison and I, and Democrats united across the country, will be your worst nightmare. https://t.co/fu7WvLofrD \n— Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 25, 2017 \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:30:05.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
