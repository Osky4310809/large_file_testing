Antonella Crescimbeni \nThe Rowans were the first THON family to take the Penn State THON's event stage during Family Hour to speak, and they shared their story. \nConnor's mother, Mary-Anne Rowan, held a microphone tightly in her hand as she addressed the packed Bryce Jordan Center. \nRowan said when she was asked to speak at THON 2017 her reactions were two-fold. On one hand she was terrified, having never spoken to this many people at one time. \n\"But, my second thought was how many chances will I get to say thank you to this many people,\" Rowan said. \nStanding next to her husband, Michael, and her sons, Rowan told Connor's story. \nIn December 2014, Connor was just over 3 years old when he came into his house doubled-over from pain in his stomach, Rowan said. \nShe said the family never thought for a second that it could have been cancer. \nAfter two visits to the emergency room, doctors told the family they discovered a mass in the toddler's liver. \n\"In that moment — panic, shock, heartbreak — I can't even explain it,\" Rowan said. \"If you've ever silently screamed, that's what I did. I didn't want to scare him.\" \nAfter getting transferred to Hershey Medical Center, Connor's life really kicked into gear. \nThe doctors there told Rowan that her son had a form of liver cancer. \n\"They said he needed this seven-hour surgery,\" Rowan said. \"This all happened in 24 hours.\" \nThat evening while preparing for the major surgery, Connor whispered to his mother that when he grew up he wanted to be Spider-Man. \nRowan said all she was thinking was, \"Please grow up.\" \nRowan said that by the following January the family felt they could relax and have a little hope. \nConnor went through four rounds of chemotherapy to combat his cancer, and in March 2015 he finished his final treatment. \nThe Rowan family did not face Connor's treatment alone. \nIntroduced to Four Diamonds by a social worker as well as nurses around the hospital, and Connor's family was first paired with the Clown Nose Club. \nThe Connor Rowan family attended THON in 2016, their first dance marathon. \n\"The positive memories our boys make with you, begin to overtake the negative ones,\" Rowan said. \"We think you are one of the best things to happen to us.\" \nThe family is now paired with the Ad Pi Omega, a community service fraternity. \nConnor's mother thanked all of THON and its volunteers from the THON stage, and she announced happily that, \"as of today Connor is 22 months in remission.\" The Marcus Josey Family", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:42:13.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
