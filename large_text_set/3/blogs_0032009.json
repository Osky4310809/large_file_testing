In fact, “Movie Guide, The Family Guide to Movies and Television,” has created a petition to stop Amazon from celebrating this man’s despicable additions to our society. \nThe petition comments as follows: \n“Yes, Mr. Hefner has contributed to American history, but those contributions are corrupt and vile. Let’s remember that he single-handedly led the so-called sexual revolution, which normalized cohabitation and the ‘hook up culture’ that we now endure. His publishing opened the doors for the pornography epidemic that we are suffering from today when everyone from 12 year-old-boys to grown men are addicted. And, he even sponsored the lower-court cases that led to Roe v. Wade, which kills millions upon millions of children each year. Yes, Mr. Hefner has a legacy, but not one we want served up as entertainment!” \nYou can sign the petition here to urge Amazon to withdraw the series.
