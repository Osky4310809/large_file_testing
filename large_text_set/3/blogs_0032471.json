far from delivering 5,000 extra GPs promised by the government, figures from earlier this week show that the number of full-time GPs is, in fact, falling.” \nHe added: “At a time when our hospitals are in deficit, GPs are unable to keep up with the number of patients coming through the surgery door and staff are working under impossible conditions.” GPs will need to be available for longer (Photo: Getty) \nNHS staffing \nA new “fast track” programme for nurses is being launched by the NHS to boost nursing numbers on wards. \nThe Nurse First programme will provide financial support for graduates who have degrees in subjects that are not nursing, but that are related. \nIt will enable people wishing to become a nurse to take a fast-track “top up” programme that will lead to them becoming a graduate nurse. \nThe programme will first supply nurses to mental health positions and those aimed at looking after people with learning disabilities. \nProfessor Jane Cummings, Chief Nursing Officer for England, said: “It’s vital we continue to attract the best and brightest graduates, offering additional entry routes and career opportunities, so that we can continue to deliver specialist, high-quality care to all.” \nVERDICT: Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed the move but warned action was also needed to persuade existing nurses not to quit. \nShe said: “The current shortage of nurses and unsafe staffing levels puts high quality patient care at risk. A fast track programme is being introduced for nurses (Photo: Getty) \n“Specialist nurses are key to every part of this plan - from cancer care to mental health. If it is to work, the Government and NHS England must find a way to retain nursing staff who currently feel no choice but to leave.” \nAnd UNISON head of health Christina McAnea added: “Ministers need to realise that unless they come up with the cash for a decent pay rise, \nhealth employees will keep on leaving. And without well-trained and experienced staff, the plan looks doomed to fail.” \nEmergency and urgent care \nNHS chiefs plan to ease pressure on A&E by offering better access to GP services, an “enhanced” 111 service, and 150 newly designated 150 Urgent Treatment Centres. \nThey will be open 12 hours a day and will treat those whose conditions mean they don’t need to go to A&E but also can’t wait to see their GP. \nPatients will be seen by medics with access to diagnostic facilities including X-ray machines. \nThey also plan to station some GPs in A&E units so they can catch patients who turn up at casualty wards but don’t actually require emergency care. There is a plan to ease pressure on A&E (Photo: AFP) \nThe plans also involve the rollout of NHS 111 online, allowing people to enter specific symptoms and received advice on management of conditions by email. \nBut critics fear this could lead to patients in need of urgent care being missed by the system. \nThe NHS plan also aims to free up up to 3,000 acute hospital beds by working better with social services to prevent delayed transfers of care. \nBut experts warn extra cash will be needed to help councils boost social care in order to relieve the strain on the NHS. \nChris Ham, chief executive of health think tank The King’s Fund, said: “Hospitals are now under pressure all year round and so the ambition to improve A&E performance and other key services within the current budget is extremely ambitious. \n“Putting the onus on the NHS and local authorities to work together to improve social care and free up hospital beds is the right approach. \n\"But with growing pressures on both services, expecting 3,000 hospital beds to be freed up is optimistic. \n“With almost no growth in the NHS budget from next year, the government will need to revisit the NHS funding settlement to deliver the commitments set out in this plan.” Give us cash to stop the agony \nJunior doctor Rachel Clarke Dr Rachel Clarke (Photo: Rex Features) \n“We can pay, doctor – we have our savings,” he pleaded, eyes boring into mine. “He can’t carry on with the pain, you see,” his wife added. “Please do something to help him.” \nAt 76, after a lifetime of farming, David’s knees were crippled with arthritis . Knee replacements would give him his life back. \nBut my hands were tied. Houdini couldn’t break into an NHS orthopaedic waiting list, never mind a junior doctor. With tears now welling in David’s eyes, I was forced to turn him away. \nIf Theresa May or Jeremy Hunt ever confronted the faces we do – desperate, begging, contorted with pain – would they still refuse quite so casually to fund a first-class health service? \nNews that even more patients are set to endure long waits for operations is not a minor “trade-off” – it is an indictment of a Cabinet that is happy to stump up £56billion for a high-speed train line, yet won’t protect vulnerable citizens from unendurable pain.
