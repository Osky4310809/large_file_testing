Thanks to Tinder, two adorable cat brothers are in each others’ lives again – and their humans are in love!\nBrian Herrera and Cathleen Cavin matched on Tinder and chatted on the app for a long time, but Cavin said she wasn’t really feeling it.\n“I didn’t even want to go on a date,” she told Petaluma 360. “I was trying to get out of it.” Even though Cavin had reservations, the two totally hit it off when they met for dinner in the summer of 2016. After talking for hours, Cavin went with Herrera back to his house – where she saw the splitting image of her own cat , Ozzie.\n&\nCats, separated at Petaluma shelter, reunited when owners start dating http://m.tbnn.it/NP6rN0\nPosted by Breaking Petaluma News on  Thursday, February 16, 2017 \n“I start looking at the cat, and I’m like, ‘That’s my cat. You have my cat,’” she said. “And he’s like, ‘No, that’s my cat.’ So he thought I was some crazy cat lady, and I said, ‘No, I promise you. Come over to my house.’” After checking their adoption records, Cavin and Herrera learned they’d adopted two cats from the same litter at the same shelter. \nThe couple has been dating ever since, and they plan to move in together in March, where the two brothers can play and snuggle to their hearts’ content.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:40:29.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
