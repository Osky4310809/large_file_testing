And they would be right. \nBut it's for a good reason that van de Leest keeps dropping the word 'movement', because the best way of looking at the Pirates is as an emancipatory movement of the betas, or \"nerds\", as van de Leest calls herself in their campaign movie. Her goal is to create more technological awareness in Dutch Parliament. [ Editor's note: van de Leest was formerly a fetish model and columnist for FHM magazine under the name \"Ancilla Tilla\", and has been a privacy advocate for years .] \nDutch politicians mainly consist of alphas and gammas – people who have little understanding of the technological developments and are stuck in a linear reactionary mindset. Privacy, robotics, genetics, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology are issues that should be subjects for discussion, but are hardly on the political radar, as evidenced by nearly all election programs. \nThere is a serious lack of the necessary technological knowledge in Dutch Parliament, \"and that's why we need nerds,\" van de Leest says. Today will show whether the Dutch agree: in pre-election polling, the party had one seat. [ Editor's note the Netherlands has a system of proportional representation ]. Just one, to put the gigantic subject of privacy, digital technology and technological process on the political map. \nMotherboard: Hi Ancilla. Let's start with privacy. What do you think of the contradiction between security and privacy that many politicians seem to copy directly from Rob Bertholee, the boss of the AIVD (the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service)? Bullshit, of course. \nDo explain. Privacy is a security mechanism – it means a healthy distance between citizens and powerful parties such as insurance companies or security forces, who want to make use of private data from individuals or groups who are less powerful. \nIf you are able to explain this so easily, then why are there so few people in the government who act on it? Why does safety win so easily over privacy? I think it's very human to try to win even more power when you're already in a powerful position. This is an age-old tendency, and this is exactly why there is a constitutional limit imposed on power. \nNot everyone in the Second Chamber [House of Representatives] is looking to get more power. How is it possible that a majority of the House is voting for the dragnet surveillance bill – a law that probably goes against the European Human Rights Law? Do they know something that I don't? No, the opposite is true. The digital world is a new playing field. You don't just go through somebody's mail and you don't just tap someone's phone. These things are evident to all of us, but this all changes when it comes to bits and bites, because it's abstract. It's not a person who is eavesdropping on you, it's an algorithm, and there are very few people who realize what that means, or what such an algorithm even is. And the same goes for Parliament. Ancilla van de Leest at the Dutch VICE HQ. Image: VICE Netherlands \nWhat are you going to do about that? In a general sense, clarifying by using strong visual analogies. But more importantly, making clear that there is not a single subject that is not affected by technological developments. Technology should be central to any debate. \nName an example? When Parliament is talking about logistics, transport and infrastructure, then the issue of privacy should be central to that debate. It should become a given to discuss self-propelled vehicles, sensors and cameras by the roadside, and environmental zones in large cities that scan your license plate. These all store information that could be of interest to, for example, tax authorities, who want to know where you are parking. At the moment, these matters aren't being discussed at all – or as a side note. \nMore examples! The health care debate can no longer be seen as being separate from computerization and the ethical debate of the use of robots within health care. There is no party who is structurally discussing this. Health insurers should be automatically linked to privacy. For example, there is a health insurance company who offers you a discount if you're a vegetarian. I'm making good use of it. \nWow, which company is that? I'm now with the Silver Cross, I think. Now, it looks harmless enough, because I'm just telling them that I'm a vegetarian and they trust that I am telling the truth. But the moment they actually start checking my bills to see whether I've bought steak recently, we have a problem. I don't want to live in a world where I have to prove my innocence. Do you want another example? \nOkay. Car insurance companies offer discounts on premiums if you are highly educated, because research apparently shows that highly educated people cause less accidents. Financially it makes sense, but in my opinion it's the first step to a world where the disadvantaged are taken advantage of even more. \nAccording to the latest polls of Eenvandaag, you now have one virtual seat in Parliament. How are you going to convince a room full of alphas that an oil tanker should shift its course with just one seat? You need a loudmouth in the House, I think. That has worked out very well for the Party of the Animals, too. Before they were around, animal welfare was not really a priority within Dutch politics. When they were voted into Parliament, everyone tried to laugh it off, but we're now ten years along the road and almost not a single party has included anything about animal welfare in their manifesto. \nStill, most parties now seem convinced of the importance of privacy and Internet security. In other words: is the Pirate Party still necessary? According to Privacy Barometer, The Party of the Animals scores high on privacy, and so do GroenLinks and D66. You can easily get away with minimal effort, at the moment. The Party of the Animals wasn't even present in the debate about the new Intelligence and Security Services Act. So it's easy to say you're a pro-privacy party all of a sudden, but where were you in that debate? It's pure nonsense. The House of Representatives doesn't currently have the knowledge needed to be really privacy-friendly. \nWhat about Astrid Oosenbrug? Astrid Oosenbrug of the Labour Party knew what she was talking about, but she is giving up the fight after 4 years, because it's just not discussed in the House. We're in the midst of a digital revolution but we're still pretending it's the nineties. \nWhat is your biggest concern at the moment? Russian hackers? The Dutch security service? Or big companies like Facebook? I've been really worried about voting machines for a long time now. The VVD is strongly in favor, while every single expert and every hacker and anyone who knows anything about technology is saying: \"This really is the worst idea ever.\" \nCan you name anyone? Rob Gonggrijp of XS4ALL, Ronald Prins of Fox-IT and Arjan Kamphuis of Brunell. That is a group of people who are experts. They've come together to advise the government on this, but the government is showing very little interest. Something like: \"Great advice, we'll see if we use it.\"Imagine that we must question the correctness of the outcome of the elections. How can a democracy ever justify that? There is no more effective way to kill trust in a democracy – trust that is very hard to regain. The Netherlands should never get themselves in that position. \nOkay, but are you arguing for technological experimentation within a direct democracy? Certainly. In fact, we are conducting experiments in this area. In West Amsterdam, there is now a platform for residents on how to improve their neighborhood. Because nobody had done that before. Nobody cared. This all sounds quite simple and logical, but it did not exist before. \nHow does that work? Just by going to the community center...? We use Loomio. This is a platform that works in a very simple way, a bit like Reddit. You posit an argument and people can upvote or downvote it. They can also make suggestions for improvement this way, which in turn get up- or downvotes. This way you quickly reach a consensus. That's how we made our party program. \nYou've said that the Pirate Party remains an extra-parliamentary movement in addition to a political party. What do you mean by that, and how is that different from other parties? We leave a lot of room for the bottom-up movement, so if you have personal initiatives that you want to undertake within the Pirate Party, we will offer lots of space for that. \nWhat kind of space? Space to take initiative yourself. \nHow are you going to be finding these civilians? Micro targeting? Online.
