A proposal under consideration at the Legislature would direct the state to buy or lease Prairie Correctional Facility, a 1,600-bed prison in Appleton that’s been sitting empty since losing contracts in 2010. Chief sponsor Rep. Tim Miller, R-Prinsburg, focused on the potential to house hundreds of inmates currently incarcerated in county jails ill-equipped to deal with them. Miller emphasized that the state would operate the facility, and that it would be staffed by unionized correctional workers. “We need a solution to prison overcrowding now, and I believe utilizing the Appleton facility is a no-brainer,” said Miller. Civil rights groups strongly oppose reopening the Appleton facility, joined by corrections union members and a coalition of faith-based organizations who say the state shouldn’t do business with the prison’s owner, CoreCivic, or the for-profit prison industry as a whole. Many showed up at a House Public Safety Committee hearing Tuesday to oppose the bill. The current language does not specify whether the state would buy or lease the facility, nor does it stipulate any terms of a potential lease. Glen Stubbe, Star Tribune Rep. Tim Miller, R-Prinsburg, sponsor of a bill to reopen the private prison in Appleton spoke before the committee. Speaking in favor of the bill were Gary Hendrickx, Swift County Commissioner, center and Appleton Mayor Chad Syltie, right. Rick Neyseen, a local AFSCME representative and sergeant at Minnesota Correctional Facility-St. Cloud, warned legislators to “beware of the bait and switch”— voicing suspicions that a lease this year could lead to a price hike or full-on CoreCivic takeover down the road. “Doing business with CoreCivic is like doing business with the devil,” Neyseen said. “The company cuts corners to make a buck and they profit from human misery.” Critics also argued that Minnesota should focus on cutting its prison population rather than finding more space to let it flourish. But measures to reduce prison ranks have generated little enthusiasm among state legislative leadership or in President Trump’s administration. Last year, Minnesota lawmakers did pass a major drug reform bill. But even accounting for that long-term impact, the state’s prison overcrowding problem is projected to hit 1,130 by 2026 — meaning about 10 percent of the inmate population won’t fit inside existing facilities — according to forecast data from the Minnesota Department of Corrections. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has also strongly signaled that governments need to revert to tough-on-crime policies, and he made quick work of reversing an Obama-era memo to phase out private prisons in the federal system. Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Tom Roy, whose department would oversee any new facility, countered Tuesday that opening a new prison isn’t the only way to address overcrowding. He pointed to last year’s drug-sentencing reform and the potential to expand early-release programs as more cost-effective examples. Beyond the initial cost of reopening the prison, Roy warned that “once a prison is open of this size or even lesser capacity, we’re looking at a $30 to $40 million annual expenditure to operate a prison. That is no insignificant amount.” The committee held over Miller’s bill for possible inclusion in a broader package of public safety proposals. Rep. Tony Cornish, R-Vernon Center, said he would unveil the broader bill on Thursday. Cornish, the Public Safety committee chairman, is a cosponsor of Miller’s bill, and has been a strong supporter the Appleton option. He urged lawmakers on Tuesday to get into business with CoreCivic before the federal government snatches up the facility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T22:35:25.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
