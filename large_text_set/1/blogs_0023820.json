The brand is not sure about adding this feature, but it’s still on the table. The phone will feature the same 12.3MP rear camera as the Pixel, but will get advanced low-light photography and will also be getting some new features. The source suggests that the Google Pixel 2 prototypes are being tested with Snapdragon 83X processors, and others with Intel chipsets. \nThe report claims that the Google Pixel 2 will arrive with an expensive price tag of $700, around Rs 47,700.
