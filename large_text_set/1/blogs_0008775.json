Fallon‚Äôs opening number, a tribute to awards darling La La Land, was the perfect way to kick off an awards show in the city of stars for the city of stars.\nIt began ‚Äî as many Los Angeles days do ‚Äî with a bunch of people sitting in traffic. This time, the freeway was replaced by the Golden Globes carpet, and a sea of stretch limos. The Stranger Things squad rapped, Nicole Kidman and Amy Adams danced, and Westworld ‚Äôs Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) and Game of Thrones ‚Äô Kit Harington made appearances.\nOf course, Justin Timberlake and Fallon also shared a Ryan Gosling/Emma Stone-style dance in the stars (only after Fallon hilariously turned down Tina Fey). We'd watch that remake.\nHugh Laurie's HFPA joke Hugh Laurie gets political during his acceptance speech at the #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/eQY5oQ1Uzh\n‚Äî Mash Entertainment (@mashentertain) January 9, 2017\nDespite dramatic turns like his Globe-winning work in The Night Manager , Laurie is a finely honed comedian, delivering wisecracks with a sarcastic twinkle in his eye.\n‚ÄúLAST GOLDEN GLOBES,‚Äù he said while accepting his award. ‚ÄúI don't mean to be gloomy but it has the words 'Hollywood,' 'foreign' and 'press' in it,\" he said, referencing the coming Donald Trump administration.\nDev Patel and Sunny Pawar co-presenting and melting our hearts And the award for cutest presenter goes to Sunny Pawar #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/Gy15p6wvfW\n‚Äî Mash Entertainment (@mashentertain) January 9, 2017\nSorry Jacob Tremblay, sorry Stranger Things kids, but the most popular pint-sized red carpet celeb is Lion ‚Äôs Sunny Pawar, rocking his kicks and having to be lifted magnificently into the air by Dev Patel to introduce Lion ‚Äôs Best Motion Picture - Drama nomination.\nMY HUSBAND AND SON ARE PRESENTING EXCUSE ME\n‚Äî Proma (@promawhatup) January 9, 2017\nRyan Reynolds and Andrew Garfield kiss While we were busy watching one of our many internet boyfriends Ryan Gosling talk about being a dreamy pianist in La La Land, the other Canadian Ryan (Reynolds) and Andrew Garfield shared an intimate moment. Thankfully, the internet was there for us ‚Äî and made sure it was a moment we didn‚Äôt miss.\nAnd just like that: A new bromance is born. We totally ‚Äòship it.\nViola Davis introducing Meryl Streep Davis and Streep shared the screen in 2008's Doubt , and Davis's introduction for Streep's Cecil B. DeMill award was pure poetry. Viola, please introduce everything forever.\n\"Dame Streep,\" said a reverent Davis. \"Her artistry reminds of the impact of what it means to be an artist, which is to make us feel less alone.\"\nI have never met Viola Davis but pls have her do my eulogy.\n‚Äî Cameron Esposito (@cameronesposito) January 9, 2017\nStreep's speech was perfect as well.\nMoonlight wins Best Motion Picture - Drama\n2016 was an exceptional year for movies . La La Land may have swept its categories , but with Comedy and Drama separated for the Globes, Moonlight 's victory was imminent. Barry Jenkins' poignant and understated story of one boy's journey to manhood is stirring, immense and not to be missed.\nThe Worst Jimmy Fallon's Chris Rock impression Fallon may have meant it to be innocent, but his impersonation of Chris Rock immediately ignited criticism.\nJimmy Fallon's Chris Rock impression reminded us of one person in particular... https://t.co/RR5ckgPEh5 #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/UIKlYIXZU1\n‚Äî Andrew Springer (@springer) January 9, 2017\nSofia Vergara ‚Äúmisreading‚Äù teleprompter How many times are they going to make Sofia Vergara make fun of her of own voice? #GoldenGlobes\n‚Äî Ashley Weatherford (@sincerelyash) January 9, 2017\nIt's an awful waste to make Vergara ‚Äî a beautiful, hilarious, talented actress ‚Äî do the same bit every time. We get it, she has an accent. Must it always be poked fun at?\n\"Hidden Fences\" NO. NO. He did not just say #HiddenFences ! There can be two movies about Black women at the same time, seriously. SERIOUSLY. #GoldenGlobes .\n‚Äî Shelby Knox (@ShelbyKnox) January 9, 2017\nIn a year when the Best Limited Series category included The Night Of , The Night Manager , American Crime and American Crime Story , the titles that kept getting garbled were Hidden Figures and Fences . Jenna Bush Hager made the mistake on the red carpet while interviewing an unamused Pharrell Williams, which was a significant enough standalone gaffe before Michael Keaton repeated it during the awards ceremony.\nIt's \"Hidden Figures,\" Michael Keaton. #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/ojtgsfUCLg\n‚Äî Mash Entertainment (@mashentertain) January 9, 2017\nChastain and the Redmayne üé∂ Chastain and the Redmayne...
