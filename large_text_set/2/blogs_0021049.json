Who was at the other end? Tunde Sabiu, personal assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari.” \n“Hold on for Mr. President,” Tunde said. \nThen came the President who said: “Femi, how are you? (He calls me Adesina most times, but today (yesterday), he opted for Femi).” \n“I screamed.’ Mr President, I have missed you. How are you sir? \n“He first laughed. That familiar laugh. Then he said: ‘I am still resting. Thank you for holding out against mischief makers.’ \n“I said it was my duty, the very least I could do, adding how happy I was to speak with him. \n‘How is your family?’ \n“I said we were fine, and he asked me to extend his greetings to them. \n“‘I hope to call you again, ” Mr President said, and I bade him farewell, adding: ‘Best wishes, sir’.” \nAdesina added that the call made his day, saying he never sought to speak with the president to debunk rumours about his health. \n“It was a defining moment for me. For more than a month, I had always spoken with aides who are with the president in London,” he wrote. \n“Not once did I ask them to take the phone to him, deliberately so, because I didn’t need to speak with him to validate the fact that he was alive. And since he was on vacation, he had a right to his privacy. \n“Of his own volition, President Buhari spoke with me. It made my day. Even if he hadn’t done so, he would have remained my President, my leader, and my man. Any day.” \nGarba Shehu also took to the social media to explain how he missed the President’s phone call. \nHe said: “A day for the Presidential Media Team. We are thankful to the President, Muhammadu Buhari for sparing the time to make calls to the Media team. \n“The Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed and the Special Adviser, Femi Adesina responded to the calls, exchanged greetings and thanked him for calling. \n“I had an SMS from him thereafter because I missed my call! I humbly join them to say thank you, Baba Buhari!! “We are together with other Nigerians of all faiths, in praying for his safe return.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:54:02.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
