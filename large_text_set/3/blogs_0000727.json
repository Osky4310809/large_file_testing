In fact, in 1947, while helping out at the typographical magazine Alphabet & Image, he hit on the idea of a competition that called for designers to create a 27th letter of the alphabet. Now, 70 years later, the contest is being run again in connection with The Book Collector .\nThe 2017 competition will follow Ian Fleming&apos;s original rules, namely that the experimental design must conform to the alphabet as known in English-writing countries, and that it must represent a recognised sound or combination of sounds. In terms of design, entrants must also demonstrate decorative, philological and typographical skill.\nA designer&apos;s guide to typography and fonts James Fleming, Ian&apos;s nephew, says: “I was intrigued to hear about the alphabet competition and I thought it was a good idea to give this another go. Creative heads don&apos;t need a professional qualification in order to enter. Anyone with an idea as to how the English language could be improved in a way that complies with the competition rules can take part.\n\"Last time submissions included &apos;-sion&apos;, &apos;th&apos; and &apos;st&apos;, but alternatives are yours to explore. Given that most people embrace the fast-moving world of social media, perhaps this time the new letter will become part of the alphabet.\"\nFull rules and conditions can be found at The Book Collector , with the competition running from 15 March to 25 April 2017. The winner will be announced at the ABA Olympia Book Fair on 2 June, with a £250 cash prize up for grabs.\nRelated articles: \nThe 8 biggest typography mistakes designers make Use spacing effectively in typography Top 7 typography galleries to inspire your designs ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T11:14:10.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
