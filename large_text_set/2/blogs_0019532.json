Oh, but it gets better… 2 \nWayne Shaw, the man they call the “roly-poly goalie” was prompted to eat the pie after hearing that a bookmaker was offering odds of 8-1 on him eating on live television during their match at Gander Green Lane. Shaw apparently had some buddies who put money on the bet and decided he wanted to have a little fun. So he went to the local bar at halftime and got himself a pie. \nApp users click HERE to see video below. 3 Sutton United's sub goalkeeper Wayne Shaw, 46, is eating a pie on the bench.

It’s worth noting that Shaw ate the pie after all three substitutions had been made, which is the most substitutions you can make in world soccer so there was no chance of Shaw going into the game. And it gets even better… 5 \nThe Football Association and Gambling Commission has launched an investigation into the incident, noting that Shaw might have breached their gambling regulations.
