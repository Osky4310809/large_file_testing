Last October, the rapper teased the release of new tunes, but it wasn’t until Saturday that Drake finally released his new project, More Life . It was sort of excruciating waiting, since Drizzy teased his fans with three tracks over the course of the past few months, offering up “Sneakin’,” featuring 21 Savage, “Fake Love,” and “Two Birds, One Stone,” which is a bit of a diss track aimed at Pusha T and Kid Cudi.\nThe project was supposed to start streaming on OVO Sound Radio (via Apple Beats 1) on Saturday at 6 p.m. ET, but there was a bit of a delay.\nTwitter was not happy.

Drake phoned in a message from London, thanking everyone for waiting (and ordering shots for the people who were with him). And it was totally worth the wait. The “playlist,” as Drake is calling it, starts with “Free Smoke,” a song that includes shoutouts to J.Lo and Applebee’s. How could this be a bad project when it starts off like that?\nDrake: \"To each and every person listening, I truly do wish you more love, more blessings...and of course #MoreLife \" #OVOSOUNDRADIO \n— Rap-Up (@RapUp) March 18, 2017 Drake explained the playlist concept to DJ Semtex in an interview in February, saying, “The style in which it’s being put together is based on the concept of OVO Sound Radio. It’s almost like a radio show .”\nHe added,\n“I basically asked myself ‘What if I did it like OVO Sound Radio but every song was a new Drake song?’ It’s more like an evolution of a mixtape. After Views , I was inspired and I wanted to keep the music going and get people inspired.” After a lot of teasing with Instagram posts and other veiled social media hints ( Drake fans are the best for catching them all), the final drop on OVO Sound Radio and Apple Music on Saturday happened , and you can hear the whole album on OVO Radio (it’s episode 39) . Unlike Views , which was only available through Apple Music for WAY TOO LONG , you can also hear More Life on Spotify and Amazon Music, according to Fader .\nMore Life pic.twitter.com/TK54NKaj8w \n— OVO Sound (@OVOSound) March 18, 2017 The 25 tracks are everything you’ve come to love and respect about Drake (please see “Get It Together” with Black Coffee and Jorja Smith). But we’ll let you be the judge of this long-awaited project. Love him or hate him, you better brush up on More Life, because summer is just around the corner, and the whole album, er, PLAYLIST, is bound to be blasting from every car, roof, and someone’s earbuds standing next to you in Starbucks all season.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-19T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T01:21:59.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
