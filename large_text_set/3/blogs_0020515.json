Juha Kaakinen. Photograph: Juha Kaakinen \nSo how has the country done it? By giving homeless people permanent housing as soon as they become homeless, rather than muddling along with various services that may eventually result in an offer of accommodation. \nIt’s an idea is being considered in the UK by communities secretary Sajid Javid . We spoke to Juha Kaakinen, chief executive of the Y-Foundation , which provides 16,300 low cost flats to homeless people in Finland, to find out more: \nWhat is Housing First? \nHousing First means ending homelessness instead of managing it. The basic idea is to offer permanent housing and needs-based support for homeless people instead of temporary accommodation in hostels or in emergency shelters. Permanent housing means an independent rental flat with own rental contract. \nIn Housing First people do not have to earn their right to housing by proving their capability to manage their lives. Instead, they are provided with a stable home and individually tailored support. Homelessness at crisis point in all EU countries – except Finland Read more \nHow has it worked in Finland ? \nSince 2008 the national homelessness strategy in Finland has been based on the Housing First model, as a result of dedicated cooperation between the state, municipalities and NGOs. \nInvestments have been made to provide affordable housing and shelters have been converted into supported housing units. New services and methods of help have been developed to match the multiple needs of individual tenants. \nFinland has all but eradicated rough sleeping and sustainably housed a significant number of long-term homeless people. Finland is the only country in Europe where the number of homeless people has declined in recent years. \nWhat has the public response to Housing First been? Was there any backlash? \nThere was a strong political will to find new solutions for homelessness. There were a few local reactions concerning the location of new service facilities. However, those were mainly overcome by open interaction with the neighbourhoods. \nFinancially, how does Housing First work? \nThe key things are affordable housing and support. Extra funding that the state has allocated for flats and services has been an incentive for the municipalities to implement Housing First. \nTenants pay rent and are entitled to receive housing benefits. Depending on their income, they may contribute to the cost of the services. The rest is covered by the municipalities. They provide the support themselves or buy support from other service providers, mainly from the NGOs. Lessons from Finland: helping homeless people starts with giving them homes Read more \nStable living conditions enable the use of mainstream services instead of using expensive emergency services. This will save money in a long term. \nWhere there any initial problems that needed to be ironed out? \nThe focus of the national strategy was clear from the start. The city specific implementation plans included concrete objectives and resources to meet them. Therefore, no major problems were encountered. \nThere was, however, some work to be done on attitudes. For example, the unconditional housing was hard to accept by some people in NGOs which had previously been working with different set of values. \nHow easily can the model be replicated in other European countries? \nThe Housing First model can be replicated even though housing conditions may vary from country to country in Europe. Providing permanent homes for the homeless should be a target instead of temporary solutions. \nThere is no quick fix to all life situations but a solid base provides the foundations upon which to improve the welfare of the homeless. The first step in change is the change in attitudes. \nHow much interest have you had in the scheme? Who seems most supportive? \nIn Finland this has been a national strategy, not a local project. This new approach and convincing results have raised broad interest internationally. \nSign up for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you on the last Friday of the month.
