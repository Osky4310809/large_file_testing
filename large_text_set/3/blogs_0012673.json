Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters   @JamieJackson___   22.19 GMT \nA ttack is only the best form of defence if a side attacks. This truism haunted the ultimate shock-and-awe manager, Pep Guardiola, as Manchester City sleepwalked out of the Champions League . Monaco’s Tiemoué Bakayoko condemns Manchester City to away-goal defeat Read more \nListless, confidence-shot, just not good enough: the list to describe City until they finally seemed to wake up ahead of Leroy Sane’s 71st-minute goal was not pretty reading for them. \nNeither was what followed as Tiemoué Bakayoko rose above a hapless Aleksandar Kolarov to head home and make this last-16 tie 6-6 on aggregate and knock out City on away goals. \nHolding a 5-3 lead from the opening leg , Guardiola stated City needed to score against Monaco or they would be “killed”, then kept to his word by picking a five-man goal-hunting force of Raheem Sterling, David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Sané, and Sergio Agüero. The problem was that until 62 minutes none of this side (or any other City player) registered a single strike either on or off-target. \nGuardiola also declared attack, attack, and more attack is the only way City will claim the Champions League under him. All guns blazing constantly is an admirable philosophy and not a million miles from the mantra of Guardiola’s predecessor, Manuel Pellegrini. \nThe big difference is that when his City perform as he wishes they are close to an unstoppable proposition, faster, slicker and cleverer than the Chilean’s vintage ever was. \nFatally, this was not one of those occasions. The damning bottom line is that in the biggest game of Guardiola’s reign his blueprint just did not work and City froze. \nThe Catalan was hired to win the European Cup and the Guardiola effect in continental competition was shown in the headline stat going into this match as the 45-year-old’s proud record in European competition stood at only 15 losses in 99 outings. \nThis ranked him as No1 (ahead of Louis van Gaal) and he said: “We want to win, so we will attack. From my experience, if you do not score away, you have little chance of going through. But we will also have to defend. They are strong on the counterattack, and they have to score goals. I am happy to be with my colleagues and managers on 100 games; I hope I will be celebrating tonight.” \nGuardiola may be the career forward-thinking football man who coolly stated: “I am not a coach for tackles” after the 4-2 humiliation at Leicester City, but the corollary is defence is the achilles heel of his sides. \nThe head coach admitted he is unsure if City could actually win the competition this year and hard evidence arrived on eight minutes. Kylian Mbappé’s goal pulled the tie back to only 5-4 to the visitors and came as the 18-year-old was left unguarded near to Willy Caballero’s goal. \nThe Stade Louis II can be billed as soulless arena yet even before the strike the crowd were loud so post-Mbappé’s intervention the volume was raised further. \nIt also punctured City who just could not string any sequence of passes together. The chief culprit here was De Bruyne, as the Belgian Guardiola rates highly twice failed to find a team-mate. \nIf this moved his manager to head-shaking, all of this meant the Guardiola masterplan was wobbling and the usually hyper Catalan uncommonly subdued on the touchline. So, too, the travelling support, who after an early burst of noise did not take up song until the half-hour approached. This was via their old standard, “We’re not really here”, and it became particularly apt when Monaco drew level on aggregate via Fabinho. Yet again schoolboy defending was on show, with John Stones and Kolarov each guilty of allowing space. \nThe fault-line ran from midfield to defence, though. The Guardiola style is built on relentless high pressing to win the ball back and raids on goal. Monaco 3-1 Manchester City (agg 6-6): Champions League last 16, second leg – as it happened Read more \nClose to zero of this had been on show as half-time arrived and now came a test of Guardiola, the in-game coach. Required was a mainlining of confidence back into his players and for them to actually start playing football. The front five had been anonymous: Sané, Agüero, Silva, De Bruyne and Sterling are supposed to dictate any contest but it had passed them by. \nNow was the time to arrest this and there were signs of a revival as the hour neared. After Silva and De Bruyne tapped the ball around the latter later found Sterling along the right. Next Sané finally came alive down his left corridor but the statistic of no shots on or off target at this juncture was glaring. \nGuardiola had predicted a shootout, so for his side not to take aim and fire even once until Agüero broke the sequence just after the hour was odd. \nThe frustration coursing through Guardiola was illustrated when Sané’s miss was followed by his manager making as if to throw his water bottle at the bench. But far worse was to follow Now, the serious questions begin.
