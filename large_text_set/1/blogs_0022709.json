Her hair is the perfect color to get us ready for the bright colors of spring. But we also love that it has a multifaceted hue that makes it almost look natural. Because let’s face it, if anyone were to be born with stunning pink hair, we would totally believe that it would be Gigi. Plus, she also added some fabulous fringe that shows off her bright new hair color even more perfectly.\nSherbet hair definitely feels like the perfect trend to bust out of some hair monotony.
