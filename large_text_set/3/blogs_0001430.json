Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA concerned mum sparked worry among thousands of parents on social media after posting a warning about the dangers of children choking on small chocolate eggs. \nSmall egg-shaped chocolates with hard sugar shells are immensely popular and can be found with a variety of branding. Cadbury's version, Mini Eggs, are practically synonymous with Easter. \nBut the parent, writing on her Facebook page Nanny Valentine - Behaviour Coach, believes they shoudn't be given to children at all before the age of four and claims they are a choking hazard. \nShe wrote: \"Many parents are now aware of the dangers of grapes and cut them in half. \n\"Many parents don't even see these chocolate treats as a danger but they are and mustn't be given to children under 4! \n\"I cringe every time I see little ones munching on these delicious treats. The post has since been deleted from social media \n\"They are hard and the perfect shape to get lodged in a child's throat. If this post saves a little one from a terrible accident then it's worth me posting. \n\"My children are often bought these at Easter but sorry boys mummy has to eat these. \n\"Please share and help raise awareness of the danger of these eggs to our little ones.\" \nHer post, which has since been deleted from Facebook, was shared thousands of times by concerned parents. \nMirror Online contacted St John Ambulance for advice on the small chocolate eggs.
