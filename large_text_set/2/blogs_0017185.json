The image was posted by @evleaks and it calls the phone the “Galaxy S8+” while talking through some of the most important specs, like the size of the display, amount of RAM, camera, etc. \nYou can see it all for yourself in the image below, but the list says the Galaxy S8+ will feature a 6.2-inch “full rectangle” display, or 6.1-inch when factoring in the rounded corners. Yep, rounded corners, just like on the LG G6 ! As for resolution and type, we’re looking at a Quad HD+ and Super AMOLED. The “+” and “full rectangle” there are likely in reference to the 18:9 aspect ratio. \nAs for the rest, the listing mentions 4G LTE, 12MP “Dual Pixel” camera, 8MP front camera, IP68 dust and water resistance, Iris Scanner, Samsung Knox security, 64GB internal storage with microSD support, 4GB RAM, Samsung Pay, and wireless charging, along with headphones “tuned by AKG.” AKG is an acoustics and headphone company owned by Harman, which Samsung bought last year . \nThe regular Galaxy S8 is rumored to feature a 5.8-inch display and matching specs to what we see here. \nFor those worried about the size, keep in mind that the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ shouldn’t have much in terms of bezel on their fronts, so even though 6.2-inches is a lot, the overall footprint of the device shouldn’t change much from last year. \nExcited or nah? Previous Story Huawei Announces Honor VR Camera, Another 360-Degree Video Product Dee Lynch \nSpecs look real good but imma try my best to hold out for the Note 8. Hopefully, if the finger print scanner is on the S8, they’ll actually put the scanner imbedded in the screen on the Note. With that said, Sprint and Sammy better live up to there promise from Note 7 buyers. NexusPhan \nNot enough different fonts. Must be fake. \n/s Rush Hadley \nI am over gigantic 2 handed phones. I just want a phone the size of the iPhone SE with less bezel, great cameras, fingerprint scanner, front facing speakers, and fast updates. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nYou’re not going to get an SE flagship outside of the SE. Which is being updated next month. DJyoSNOW \nExcited, as an avid audio listener . Also I can get a plausible fingerprint scanner. I hate the note 4’s. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nSpecs read like a typical flagship…. Matter of fact it reads like Last Years Note 7. This doesn’t excite me much. gabe1989 \nbiq question is how big the battery is gonna be to power the larger displays. also not feeling those rounded screen corners or new FPS location. other than that sounds pretty good. DJyoSNOW \nAs little as I use the sPen. When I get a text circle one. I straight up can. I like lassoing and croping stuff. I really hope the sPen is available. Does anybody know if there is an app for that? To lasso stuff like the sPen? Gamblor77 \nAll sounds well and good but I’m still very skeptical on the battery size/life and fingerprint sensor being next to the damn camera. Just makes NO sense! It isn’t anywhere close to where my fingers hold the phone or anyone I’ve ever seen using a phone. Who are they making this for, toddlers who grip the thing with a full fist? I hope that rumour is wrong cause that’s gonna be a pain in the @ss and had camera smudges written all over it. Jeremy Turnley \nYou can always use the iris scanner, or a pin . Rob \nAwesome but still going to wait for the Note 8!!! Orion \nSame here. Samsung is saving the real specs for the next Note. Orion \nOK now I really can’t wait for the Note 8. aznmode1 \nThis makes me miss my note 7. CousinSkeeta \n6gb of ram not 4gb or i might as well get the s7e smh Lucky Armpit \nSo I don’t understand “For those worried about the size, keep in mind that the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ shouldn’t have much in terms of bezel on their fronts, so even though 6.2-inches is a lot, the overall footprint of the device shouldn’t change much from last year.” \nChange from what? The GS7E? If so, what does the GS8 compare to size-wise? Jeremy Turnley \nThe GS8 is the same ratio, but in the size of the GS7. The 8’s each are around 1mm wider and 9mm taller than the 7s. Lucky Armpit \nThanks. That goes for the GS8+ too? Assuming it has to be bigger since it’s a larger screen – just wondering what it compares to? I plan to preorder it and just want to know which size. I’ve a N6 now so assuming even the GS8+ will be smaller size-wise? Jeremy Turnley \nThe GS8 is the size of the GS7, the GS8+ is the size of the GS7 Edge. Each is taller but pretty much the same width as I described above. This is all based on math done from the side by side the picture leaked yesterday, so they might be wrong, but it’s unlikely at this point. Lucky Armpit \nTotally clarifies it for me. Just couldn’t wrap my brain around it. Thanks!! Jeremy Turnley \nHere’s the article with the assumed measurements (no thickness since we don’t have a good reference yet, but everything else). \nFor comparison, the N6 is 159.3mm x 83mm The Doctor \nHmmmm…not sure if this will be enough to pull me away from my iPhone 7 Plus. \nWe’ll see. Ryan N \nI’m probably the only one less impressed with this year’s phones than recent years, right?… Jeremy Turnley \nQHD+ is 3200×1800 if they are using industry standard naming. Which *is not* a 2:1 aspect ratio, so…. \nGot my S7 Edge for free plus a $450 Best Buy Giftcard plus free VR headset plus a portable fast charger…so I’m good for a while…until the Pixel 2 comes out. mcdonsco \nI guess we’re now calling monthly payments free? AvalancheRyder \nA larger spread in screen sizes than .4″ would be nice. mcdonsco \nWe’re in the age of the phablets…Ugh. \nThat and I really thought they would do 6gb ram this time; TW needs it. \nI would say I’ll wait for the Note 8, but I know my weaknesses…I’ll end up trying it out anyway. Jeremy Turnley \nThe GS8/GS8+ is around 1mm wider than the GS7/GS7E, and is around 9mm taller. The phones aren’t considerably bigger than last years – they just make better use of the space. MichaelFranz \nI’m a bit skeptical on the image. While I’m sure it’s mostly true I would of expected the Android reference to reference that it’s running Android 7.0 New_Guy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:55:44.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
