Though its lifetime rating stands at 3.7, it's received 3,941 one-star reviews in the last 30 days, pushing down its overall score.\nSEE ALSO: Ex-Uber employee shares harrowing tale of sexism at the company\nMany of the poor ratings appear to be directly tied to the company's policies, rather than the performance of the app itself. Numerous users cite the allegations of sexism and harassment made by former engineer Susan J. Fowler, whose blog post detailing her time at Uber went viral over the weekend.\n\"Unless you condone sexual harassment in the workplace and blatant sexism, you don't want to support this company,\" begins a one-star review, which goes on to recount some of Fowler's allegations.\nUber's US App Store ratings for the past 30 days.\nImage: app annie\n\"This company doesn't represent what I live for and I'm deleting the app,\" says another review titled \"I won't use a sexist product anymore.\"\n\"Trump supporting, driver gouging, and revolting treatment of women engineers (seriously, go look it up). Can't reconcile a company this disgusting with a cheap ride. Switch to Lyft!\"\n\"I refuse to support any company that is ok with employees being solicited for sex. I read Susan Fowler's recount of working for Uber and I was heartbroken. Sorry uber [sic] but you won't get my money anymore.\"\nNot all of the recent negative reviews cite the company's alleged sexist policies, though. Some cite poor driver pay, bad customer service and the company's use of location tracking within its app, which Uber has defended as necessary to improve reliability and safety. Many others still are upset at CEO Travis Kalanick's ties to the Trump Administration, which prompted the original #deleteUber campaign .\nIn the past 30 days alone, 993 reviews, averaging just 1.1 stars, cite \"Trump\" somewhere in the review, according to App Annie.\nUber's app appears to be faring slightly better on Google Play, where it has a 3.6-star average for the past 30 days. Android users also have their fair share of negative comments about the sexual harassment allegations and the company's perceived ties to Trump. More than 1,000 overwhelmingly negative reviews on Google's Play Store mention Trump by name.\nUber is far from the first app to have its ratings suffer as users take to app stores to air their grievances. Facebook encountered similar issues when it first began forcing users to download the standalone Messenger app, which caused the app to skyrocket to the No. 1 spot while earning it a 1-star average review.\nBONUS: The first rideable hoverbike looks like a flying death machine", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ELAK-hGXuUCHAXGkMoW1CMUvJ9Q=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390301%2F419e5040-4ab8-4173-8bf9-7b619e158d88.png", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9E2Zt4AM.m3u8", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9E2Zt4AM.jpg", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cn5fZ8v8R8nluzvY4qLRaAG37sI=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390301%2F419e5040-4ab8-4173-8bf9-7b619e158d88.png"], "published": "2017-02-22T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:26:11.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
