AP Photo/Aaron Favila \nMANILA, Philippines - President Duterte earned “ pogi (brownie) points” from some Catholic bishops after announcing in Myanmar that same-sex marriage may not be legalized in the Philippines – practically a 180-degree turn from his campaign promise. \n“That won’t work for us. We’re Catholics. And there’s the Civil Code, which says that a man can only marry a woman,” Duterte said in a speech before the Filipino community the other day. \nThe announcement caught Sorsogon Bishop Arturo Bastes by surprise. \n“It was very nice of Duterte. It is a ‘ pogi point’ for our President,” Bastes said. \nApparently referring to a magazine article on gender sensitivity, Duterte pointed out that marriage as provided by the Philippine civil code refers only to a union between a man and a woman and not to people of the same sex or members of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) communities. \nHe added that even when many countries already allow this type of marriage, it might not apply to the Philippines – being a predominantly Catholic nation.   \nHis argument runs contrary to his campaign pronouncement in February 2016 when he said, “If (a draft same-sex marriage legislation) reaches me in whatever capacity, I’ll consider it.” – With Rhodina Villanueva  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T04:16:17.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
