The latest such example is Gravity Duck Islands, which has finally made its way to Android in the Google Play Store after previously launching on iOS over a year ago in September 2015.\nSee also: Best offline Android games 4 weeks ago Developed by Ravenous Games, this is the sequel to its previous title, Gravity Duck . Like its predecessor, the sequel has you controlling an 8-bit pixelated duck through a series of levels. Of course, there are lots of traps and things that are very pointy that are trying to keep you and your duck from getting out of each level, and that’s where the “Gravity” part of the game’s title come in. With the press of a button, you can flip where gravity pulls your duck so you can hopefully succeed in getting out of the danger-filled levels. \nThe main difference in the new Gravity Duck Islands game is that, in addition to levels, you also travel in four different islands. Each one has yet another gameplay mechanic to activate. One lets your duck actually jump, while another has the bird inflate himself so he can float around. Yet another teleports the bird instantly, and finally there’s a way to turn blocks in the game from solid to empty so you can walk, or “phase”, through them. While this won’t affect gameplay, you can also collect special hats for your duck to wear while he’s trying to survive.\n\nIf you like tricky but fun retro platformers with some cool and modern gameplay, then Gravity Duck Islands is definitely worth checking out. Best of all, you can grab it at the Google Play Store right now for $2.99, with no in-app purchases at all.
