The Hollywood Reporter was invited to the party, where Poitier posed for a pretty epic picture with four generations of his family members and close confidants. Those people included children, godchildren, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, his current wife (sitting next to him) and former wife (the woman in red to the right), cousins and a few very close friends. They all gathered at Beverly Hills eatery Spago to help the Academy Award winner (the first African-American man to win best actor for Lilies of the Field  in 1964) celebrate a major milestone:\n\nAs for turning 90, when it comes to looking back on his storied career and his life in general, Poitier told  Vanity Fair   last month that he’s grateful for his journey and the people who have supported it.\n“I have been very blessed by a career that has given me both joy and gratitude,” he said, “and I am very thankful for the help of many wonderful friends and associates along the way. All this would not have happened if not for their strong belief in me.”\nThose people include all the lovely individuals you see in the photo above.\nYou can check out the full list of names of those important players pictured over at The Hollywood Reporter .\nThe post Sidney Poitier Celebrated His 90th Birthday By Taking Epic Pic With Four Generations Of His Family appeared first on MadameNoire .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T15:41:35.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
