Kentucky received 19.7 refugees per 100,000 residents. In Arizona, 19.5 refugees per 100,000 residents were resettled. Idaho took 19.0 refugees per 100,000 residents. Trump won those states as well. \nBreitbart also reported that Delaware and Wyoming were the only two states that did not receive refugees in the first three months of fiscal 2017. \nThese numbers indicate that Obama is hellbent on getting the most out of the resettlement program, with little concern for what that might mean to citizens in those areas. Instances of crime and severe illnesses don’t seem to be a deterrent for a president who wants part of his legacy to include making some sort of dent in the Syrian refugee crisis — a crisis his policies helped create. \nAs usual, Obama has shown Americans that he puts their safety and well-being last in the last days of his presidency.
