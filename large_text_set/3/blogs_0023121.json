What’s more, the dominant streaming platform is about to unload an unseemly amount of original content on its subscribers — including the first of two stand-up comedy specials by everyone’s favorite anti- Cheers bar owner, Louis C.K.\nTropic Thunder (4/1) \n\nFans of the hit 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder will probably never get the solo Les Grossman sequel they wanted — Tom Cruise included. However, en lieu of what could have been, there’s always the original Hollywood farce starring Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey and Ben Stiller — who also co-wrote and directed the film.\nGremlins (4/11) \n\nIf movies about movies aren’t your thing (i.e. if you’re more Moonlight than La La Land ), there’s always the 1984 classic Gremlins . Whether or not you think it’s the best Christmas movie ever , the brainchild of director Joe Dante, writer Christopher Columbus and producer Steven Spielberg remains a mush-watch all year round.\nMystery Science Theater 3000 (4/14) \n\nNot only does Netflix’s original revival for Mystery Science Theater 3000 finally arrive in April, but its first official trailer just dropped online. With Jonah Ray, Felicia Day, Patton Oswalt and Hampton Yount rounding out the new cast (whose characters all just happen to have wonderfully convenient connections to the original series), older fans and novice newcomers alike will surely enjoy what the gang has to say about a new batch of bad movies.\n\nHere’s the full list of titles coming to Netflix in April: \n4/1/17 \nA Weekend with the Family (2016)\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\nAcross the Universe (2007)\nAn American Tail (1986)\nAn American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991)\nAn American Tail: The Mystery of the Night Monster (1999)\nBoy Bye (2016)\nBorn To Be Free (2016)\nCool Runnings (1993)\nGood Witch : Season 2 (2016)\nGremlins (1984)\nOnly for One Night (2016)\nRichard Pryor: Live & Smokin’ (1971)\nScooby-Doo (2002)\nSchindler’s List (1993)\nSomething’s Gotta Give (2003)\nThunderstruck (2012)\nWynonna Earp : Season 1 (2016)\nTrouble with the Curve (2012)\nTropic Thunder (2008)\nThe Tenth Man (2016)\n4/2/17 \nThe D Train (2015)\n4/4/17 \nChewing Gum : Season 2 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nLouis C.K. 2017 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n4/6/17 \nDisney’s The BFG (2016)\n4/7/17 \nEl Faro De Las Orcas — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nDawn of the Croods : Season 3 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nThe Get Down : Part 2 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nWin It All — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n4/8/17 \nKubo and the Two Strings (2016)\n4/10/17 \nDocumentary Now! : Season 2 (2016)\n4/11/17 \nKevin Hart: What Now (2016)\n4/12/17 \nDC’s Legends of Tomorrow : Season 2 (2016)\n4/14/17 \nChelsea : Season 2 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nEl Elegido (2017)\nMystery Science Theater 3000: The Return — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nSandy Wexler — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n\n4/15/17 \nDisney’s Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)\nSlam — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n4/18/17 \nLucas Brothers: On Drugs — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n4/19/17 \nA Plastic Ocean \n4/21/17 \nBill Nye Saves the World : Season 1 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nGirlboss : Season 1 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nHot Girls Wanted : Turned On: Season 1 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nSand Castle — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nTales by Light : Season 2 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nThe Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show : Season 4 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nThe Prestige (2006)\nTramps — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n4/22/17 \nThe Great British Baking Show: Masterclass : Season 1-3 (2016)\nThe Secret Life of Pets (2016)\n4/23/17 \nLiv and Maddie : Season 4 (2016)\nPhantom (2013)\n4/24/17 \nLong Nights Short Mornings (2016)\n4/25/17 \nDisney’s Queen of Katwe (2016)\nThe 101-Year-Old Man Who Skipped Out on the Bill and Disappeared — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nVir Das: Abroad Understanding — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n4/26/17 \nReal Rescues : Season 6-7 (2012)\nTrust (2010)\n4/27/17 \nLas Chicas del Cable : Season 1 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n4/28/17 \nA Murder in the Park (2014)\nCasting JonBenet — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nDear White People : Season 1 — NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nRodney King — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\nSmall Crimes — NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM\n4/30/17 \nSofia the First : Season 3 (2015)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:58:39.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
