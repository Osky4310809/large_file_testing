The new photo set showcases six model versions from the refreshed Typ 5G’s 2017 lineup, with the lion’s share of photos being that of the new GTI in both three- and five-door styles. \nAlso to be seen are the Golf GTD and the Golf 2.0 TDI 150 PS as well as two estate body-style versions, the Variant in its 2.0 TDI and GTD forms. Rounding off the list is the Golf 1.5 TSI, a new addition to the range. \nThe latter is equipped with the automaker’s new 150 PS 1.5 litre EA211 TSI evo turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine, with standard-fit Active Cylinder Technology (ACT) variable displacement. \nNew bits brought along by the refresh include LED daytime running lights as well as full-LED headlights. Full-LED tail lights also find their way on, and is standard fitment across the entire model range \nInside, the reworked Golf gets minor trim and upholstery revisions, but plenty of upgrades in terms of tech. For starters, all available infotainment system options now feature larger screens than before, with screen sizes starting at 6.5 inches for the base unit right up to 9.2 inches found in the range-topping Discover Pro system. \nAlso available as an option is the 12.3-inch Active Info Display virtual instrument cluster as seen on the B8 Passat . Also trickling down from the Passat is new safety kit, with pedestrian detection being added into the City Emergency Braking function in the car’s Front Assist system. \nGALLERY: 2017 Volkswagen Golf GTI, 3-dr and 5-dr versions \nGALLERY: 2017 Volkswagen Golf 1.5 TSI 150 PS \nGALLERY: 2017 Volkswagen Golf 2.0 TDI 150 PS \nGALLERY: 2017 Volkswagen Golf Variant 2.0 TDI 150 PS \nGALLERY: 2017 Volkswagen Golf GTD \nGALLERY: 2017 Volkswagen Golf GTD Variant Research Volkswagen Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:00:03.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
