The release stopped short of releasing the code itself.\nThe CIA continues to have no comment on the authenticity of the documents released, which WikiLeaks said is the first tranche of more to come. Independent experts have said the files appear to describe authentic “exploits,” or tools that hackers can use to penetrate a device, but many of them are dated and appear to have already been patched by tech firms. And researchers said they have been long aware of a number of the techniques.\n[ WikiLeaks disclosure exposes rapid growth of CIA digital operations — and agency vulnerabilities ]\nA CIA spokesman, Jonathan Liu, suggested that WikiLeaks’ pronouncements of the scale and impact of its Tuesday “Vault 7” release are exaggerated. “As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,” Liu said. “Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.”\nU.S. laws and policies bar the CIA from conducting electronic surveillance targeting individuals on U.S. soil. “And CIA does not do so,” Liu said.\nWithin the CIA, officials were aware before the WikiLeaks release of a loss of sensitive information, according to people familiar with the matter. The CIA’s internal security personnel, who apparently had not told the FBI, were pursuing the matter, but the scope and severity of the problem was unclear until WikiLeaks posted online the roughly 9,000 documents on Tuesday, these individuals said.\nAn immediate challenge for FBI investigators hunting for a possible mole is to pare down a list of suspects from the pool of people who had access to the information leaked — a challenging task, given that hundreds and potentially thousands of people had access to the data.\nAfter Assange’s news conference Thursday, tech companies deliberated the consequences of taking data from WikiLeaks, according to a person familiar with the discussions. They considered the legal implications of using information from documents obtained illegally and the political fallout from doing so. They questioned whether Assange was attempting to further drive a wedge between the technology industry and the U.S. government.\nSome national security experts wondered why WikiLeaks had not already shared the software flaws.\n“If WikiLeaks were really concerned about user security, they could’ve handed these vulnerabilities over to vendors immediately upon receiving this archive,” said Adam Klein, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and an expert on national security and digital surveillance. “But we know they’ve had it for some time and haven’t done so.”\nAnd Alex Rice, chief executive of HackerOne, the start-up that enlists hackers to share security flaws with tech companies for a profit, said, “This is a critical step that WikiLeaks should have taken immediately upon receipt of such information.”\n[ Exposure of CIA hacking tools renews debate over Americans’ cybersecurity vs. national security ]\nBut others praised Wikileaks’s vow to share data with tech companies. “It’s in­cred­ibly good news” for personal cybersecurity, said Nathan White, senior legislative manager for Access Now, a digital rights group. He noted how WikiLeaks also stands to gain from the move, since it has been criticized for publishing information without vetting it for privacy and security in the past.\nApple declined to comment on Assange’s statements. The company said earlier this week that “many” of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks documents had already been patched, and encouraged customers to download the most recent security update. Roughly 80 percent of customers using Apple’s iOS software have downloaded the latest update, the company said.\nGoogle declined to comment.\nThe CIA dismissed any suggestion that WikiLeaks’ release served the interests of privacy and security.\n“The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community’s ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries,” Liu said. “Such disclosures not only jeopardize U.S. personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@lizzadwoskin", "https://twitter.com/@nakashimae", "https://twitter.com/DevlinBarrett", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DevlinBarrett"], "published": "2017-03-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T00:11:50.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
