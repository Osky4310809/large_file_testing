All felines are glorious, beautiful, magical meowing gifts from the universe. So, while this kitty doesn’t look ugly, he certainly looks like something, or more specifically someone . \nIt took a month to figure it out, but Twitter user @gratiartis nailed it when he retweeted the cat’s picture on Feb. 13, with the commentary, “why does this cat look like ross geller.” \nFor those somehow unfamiliar with the name, Ross Geller is David Schwimmer’s character on the hit show Friends . The simple tweet forced thousands of Friends fans hiding in the cracks of the Internet to emerge and shout in unison, “YES! This is cat Ross Geller.” why does this cat look like ross geller https://t.co/WHQ0HiK4oI \n— hope harcourt (@gratiartis) February 13, 2017 \nThe photo of this not-ugly, famous-looking cat now has over 15,000 likes, which we hope makes Buddy very happy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:46:39.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
