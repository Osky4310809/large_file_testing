In an April 2015 filing, Kashamu asked a district court to prevent his “abduction abroad by U.S. authorities.” \nThe court dismissed the complaint, and the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling Monday. It said U.S. agents’ attempt to arrest Kashamu in coordination with local authorities would not constitute “an attempted abduction.” \nA dozen people long ago pleaded guilty in the case, including Piper Kerman, whose memoir was adapted for the Netflix show. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-26T20:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-26T18:27:24.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
