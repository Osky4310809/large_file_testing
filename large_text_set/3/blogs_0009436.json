Wenger had asked his team to play with \"honour\" and, for all their early promise, frighteningly little was evident once the task became hopeless. This is now the seventh season in succession that Arsenal have exited the Champions League at the last 16 stage. On four of those occasions, they also very briefly threatened a valiant fightback after suicidal first-leg performances. ... \n\"Hope, and fleeting glimpses of a potentially better future, can carry supporters only so far and the repeat sense of déjà-vu has created an almost fatalistic certainty about how seasons will end. Wenger's challenge between now and the end of the season is somehow to produce tangible evidence that he can change the narrative. It is easily the most difficult task of his career. For while he might have salvaged the respectability of a top-four finish from similarly unconvincing seasons previously, the broader landscape is now different. \n\"The three-season cycle of this contract was about challenging for the biggest prizes amid hope that, after the hard years of relative famine while the club moved stadium, he had constructed a squad that would compete for the Premier League or Champions League. Instead, we have seen almost a carbon copy of past frailties in the most important matches. The inability both here and in Munich to orchestrate a 'damage-limitation' mentality in the final stages of the match was frightening. It became almost difficult to watch. ... A devastating sequence of five defeats since the end of January feels pivotal in Wenger's 21-year Arsenal story, even if the chapter is still not definitively closed.\" Arsene Wenger endured another difficult night on the Arsenal bench.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:44:39.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
