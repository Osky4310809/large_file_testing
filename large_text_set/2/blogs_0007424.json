Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, released the following statement after the Trump administration announced it plans to grant final approval for the Dakota Access pipeline. \n“At the same time the Trump administration prepares to defend its violation of the right to religious liberty, it is violating tribal treaty rights by moving forward with the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Dakota Access pipeline would worsen climate change, violate tribal treaty rights and has the potential to cause more damage to sacred tribal land. The Trump administration is focused on so-called alternative facts when it should prioritize alternative energy to oil, gas and coal. I support the tribes along the pipeline route in their fight against the Dakota Access pipeline project, and I will continue to fight this harmful project.” \n\nIn October 2016, Senator Markey joined with other senators in calling on the Obama administration to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline until affected tribes are consulted and a full environmental review is conducted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:21:15.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
