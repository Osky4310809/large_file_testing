Therefore, there is negligence and deficiency in service on their part. They are jointly and severally liable for the deficiency in service and negligence,” the forum said. \nYou may also like to watch \nDhanraj submitted that advertisement given by the mobile making company showed that the handset in question was water proof. The advertisement also claimed that pictures could be taken while swimming for 30 minutes and the owner could dive up to 1.5 metres provided all ports and covers of the phone are firmly closed, he claimed. \nAccording to the complaint, on January 18, 2015, Dhanraj purchased a Sony mobile phone from a store for Rs 35,000. On August 9, 2015, handset developed fault due to rain water despite its port caps being closed. \nWhen he approched the service centre, he was told that the warranty had become void due to water ingress and would be repaired on chargeable basis, the complaint said. \nSony and the service centre also asserted that warranty of the handset had become void as per terms and conditions of the warranty and blamed the customer for negligently handling the handset.
