This changed with the release of Final Fantasy XV which featured in-game Cup Noodles ads and even a mission where players had to create the perfect Cup Noodle recipe. This seemed like a one-time only thing, but now a very famous pop idol will guest star in a Final Fantasy game.\nAriana Grande recently revealed on instagram and Twitter that she would be a character in the mobile-only, Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius . Her character is based on the look she had for her Dangerous Woman album cover — complete with a black dress, black mask, and very Final Fantasy -ish black bunny ears. Her appearance in the game marks the very first time that an American pop star has appeared in a Final Fantasy title (even if it is a mobile offshoot).\n♡ 👋🏼 I’m SO so excited to share that I’ll be featured in FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS *crying* 🌌♡ #FFBEWW @FFBE_EN https://t.co/VpnbLR7B75 \n— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) January 1, 2017 \n\nBelow, you can see some of her character’s animations.\na little peek at DW featured in #FFBEWW 🙈🙈🙈🙈🌌 ♡🐇🐇🐇🐇 \nA video posted by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jan 1, 2017 at 3:11pm PST \n\nSquare-Enix hasn’t announced when Grande’s character would be appearing in Brave Exvius or how players will be able to recruit her into their parties. Since Grande made this announcement recently, it is reasonable to assume that it should be relatively soon.\nFinal Fantasy: Brave Exvius is a free-to-play mobile game published by Square-Enix and developed by Gumi Inc. It features a brand-new cast of characters but has elements that should be familiar to fans, including summons, limit breaks, crystals, dungeon crawling, and classic turn-based role-playing mechanics.\nBrave Exvius was released in Japan in 2015 and to North America in June of 2016. The game has been downloaded over 8 million times on iOS and Android platforms globally, according to Gumi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T13:54:00.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
