Jassim claimed Hannah bruised easily \"because of her white skin\" (Photo: Facebook) \nThe mother-of-one was released on Friday after the case gain widespread media attention. \nHannah, from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, is now returning to the UK after being granted a divorce. \nIt is not known whether her son will join her. \nIn a statement sent to the Daily Record yesterday, a spokesman for the Bahraini authorities said: “With regards to the case of the British woman married to a Bahraini man who was detained on December 9, 2016, after her husband submitted a complaint of adultery against her. \n“The woman admitted to the act and she and her husband agreed to divorce. \n\"On January 5, 2017, the complainant withdrew the complaint and the wife was released. All charges of adultery were dropped. \n“That same day, a complaint was submitted to the police containing the allegation made by the wife’s mother to the British Embassy that her daughter has been physically assaulted by her daughter’s husband and that she has been detained.
