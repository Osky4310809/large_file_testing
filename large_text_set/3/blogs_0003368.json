PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Mar 5, 2017 GETTY Lib Dem lords hope to delay Theresa May's triggering of Article 50 \nThe Lib Dems plan to site 90 of the beds in Parliament so that their members in the Upper House can stay overnight there. \nThey hope that by thwarting Theresa May’s Brexit plans, they can force her to attend the European Union’s 60th anniversary celebrations on March 25. \nThis would mean the Prime Minister would have to trigger Brexit at the event in person, and face down the leaders of the 27 EU countries. Related articles TORY MPs may vote to STOP May walking away from EU without Brexit deal \nMrs May had not planned to attend as the British Government sees no point in being involved in planning the future of the bloc. \nShe is determined to push ahead with Article 50 , which starts the process of quitting the EU, in the next few weeks despite the Lords inflicting her first parliamentary defeat over Brexit on Wednesday. \nBut she could face a Tory rebellion in the Commons that ties her hands in negotiations, as well as a last-ditch attempt at sabotage by the Lords. GETTY Liberal Democrats want the Prime Minister to face the EU leaders in person \nMinisters hope MPs will strip out any amendments added by peers to dictate the terms of Britain’s negotiations when the Bill returns to the Commons on March 13. We think it highly unlikely we can stop her triggering Article 50 Senior Lib Dem strategist \nRemainers hope to keep the changes in a stand-off between Lords and the Commons. \nA senior Lib Dem strategist said: “While we think it highly unlikely we can stop her triggering Article 50 altogether, the plan is to try and delay it so that Mrs May is forced to face down European leaders directly and begin the formal divorce proceedings in person at the Treaty of Rome celebrations – something she is clearly keen to avoid.” \nPeers voted on Wednesday to amend the Bill and force the Government to guarantee the post-Brexit rights of 3.3 million EU citizens living in the UK. However, the EU refuses to discuss the rights of the 1.2 million Britons resident in other member states.
