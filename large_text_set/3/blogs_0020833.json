STAR/Michael Varcas \nMANILA, Philippines — The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) denied on Monday night the pronouncement of the Philippine National Police (PNP) on the supposed presence of the Maute group in Metro Manila. \nIn a television interview, Col. Edgard Arevalo, Public Affairs Office (PAO) head, said that based on their intelligence report, there is no Maute group in Metro Manila, contrary to what PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa claimed earlier. \n“Our assessment is the suspect arrested by the PNP is part of the group that is trying to align itself with the Maute group,” Arevalo said to ABS-CBN News Channel. \n“Our AFP monitoring still indicate that the hard core Maute group remains to be in Lanao,” he added. \nOn Monday morning, Dela Rosa presented Nacip Ibrahim, identified as member and coddler of ISIS-inspired Maute members operating in Metro Manila.   \nRecovered from Ibrahim during the operation were two .45-caliber pistols, a 9mm pistol, a submachine gun, an improvised explosive device with a 60mm mortar, bullets and seven packets of shabu. \n“This discovery leads us to believe that the Maute group has already established presence in Metro Manila, as to what extent, that is the subject of our follow-up investigation and operations,” Dela Rosa said. \nArevalo, meanwhile, confirmed that Ibrahim was part of the foiled bomb plot near the US Embassy in Manila last December but reiterated that they are a separate group from the Maute. \nDespite the conflicting statements, Arevalo echoed the appeal of Dela Rosa to the public to remain calm and vigilant. \n“What is important is for people to remain vigilant, for them to remain actively participative in reporting the goings-on in their area, especially those instances where suspicious looking people or suspicious actions of other people to be reported to authorities, to security forces, for us to be able to act upon immediately,\" the AFP-PAO head said.
