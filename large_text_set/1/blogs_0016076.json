Appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Carey’s ex-husband speaks on what he believes is behind all of the technical difficulties that rang in 2017. \n“You know me, I’m a conspiracy theorist,” he says to Ellen. “I think the government did that. They set her up. That was a distraction. They put her out there. But anyone who knows about performing and having inner ear and stuff, things like that can go wrong a lot.” \nAfter the Times Square set, Carey said that Dick Clark Productions was responsible for the disaster, but the studio said it had no responsibility for the poor performance. \nCannon continues by saying his own experiences working in television, especially as host of America’s Got Talent , help him understand how it’s not the superstar’s fault for the debacle. \n“I screw up on America’s Got Talen t all the time,” he says. “When there’s people saying things in your ear, I think she got a little flustered, but being the diva that she is, she was like, I’m just gonna walk around and pose for seven minutes.” \nAnd pose she did as her adoring fans still screamed her name. \nCheck out Nick Cannon’s interview with Ellen above and watch Mariah Carey closing out her performance below. This Vine will go down in history as the final moment of 2016 and it's perfect. https://t.co/3d82rH7vAj \n— T.
