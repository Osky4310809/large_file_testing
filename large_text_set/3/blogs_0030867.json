Sometimes those things are going to come off and sometimes they're not,\" Southgate said when asked about Sterling's display. \n\"He was a little bit tight in his back before the game and at half-time, so that was partly in my mind. \n\"Also, I felt we had Marcus and Jamie who would threaten in behind a bit more. Raheem probably likes to come and receive to feet a lot. \n\"At that stage of the game Adam [Lallana] and Dele [Alli] were playing well so that was the decision I took.\" \nSouthgate was keen to leave little doubt over Sterling's place in his future plans – the player having responded encouragingly for City this season following a nightmare Euro 2016. \n\"He's a player we really like. We don't have a lot of players in the country who can beat people in one v one situations,\" he said. \n\"He's explosive in those tight areas and he's going to get better and better. \n\"It's a young team and Raheem is still improving all the time. He's got the hunger and the desire to improve. He's a ballsy player and I like that about him.\" A post shared by Raheem Sterling x Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-27T03:47:26.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
