January 21, 2017 / Posted by: Michael K 10 Anita Yavich , the protester who threw up a gorgeous double serving of my favorite symbol at the inauguration yesterday!\nDepending on who you ask, Trump’s inauguration either brought out around 250,000 to 900,000 people ( according to the media ) or a number so YUGE that it hasn’t been invented yet (according toTrump). And that number included protesters like the purple parka-wearing warrior who tossed out a double fuck you during his speech. And just like that, the perfect poster for the women’s march was created (as well as the picture visual response I can fart back at a trick who tells me in an e-mail that I need to show nothing but respect to my president.)\nBuzzfeed reporter Mary Georgantopoulos covered the inauguration yesterday and tweeted that picture of the middle finger-wielding champion in purple along with this caption:\nLots of middle fingers up in the air during Trump’s speech\nThe blog Angry Asian Man says that the two-gun saluter has been ID’d as Anita Yavich, a Broadway costume designer who and Associate Professor of Theater Design at SUNY Purchase. Keep those middle fingers up, Anita! (Although, they may get tired sometime between now and 2020, so she may want to invest in two of these .)\nPic : @marygeorgant", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T21:17:42.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
