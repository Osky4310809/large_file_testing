That I would be an inspiration to many others, that I would be the push that others needed to find their way. I would've laughed in your face. Me? The chubby one? No way! But now I can't see myself ever stopping!” she captioned the post. https://www.instagram.com/p/BO_EAcdhqa7/?taken-by=khloekardashian&hl=en/embed \n“I am completely honored and taking my role seriously in helping motivate and teach people what I had to learn to better myself from the inside out. Becoming stronger mentally so I can't let the little things break me down. I see myself only getting better and better! I can't believe how far I have come! I almost can't believe that was me! If you've lost your motivation don't beat yourself up about it, negative thoughts only turn into negative realities. By keeping positive about your body, your inner health, your mental sanity, your fitness and what you're trying to achieve, you're way more likely to succeed. My fitness journey was for myself and myself alone. On my terms and on my timeline! Cheers to us becoming better than we were yesterday! #RevengeBody ”. Khloe Kardashian (Photo: Splash News) Khloe lost 40lbs (Photo: SNAPCHAT/Khloe Kardashian) \nThe reality star recently revealed how she lost almost three stone in a year in a bid to bury her sadness about her marriage breakdown. \nKhloe went on a health kick back in 2015 after her relationship with Lamar Odom began to fall apart, and she's since written a book – Strong Looks Better Naked – about her transformation. \nNow she's come top of heat magazine's 2016 Fit List, beating Scarlett Moffatt, Adriana Lima and Charlotte Crosby to the number one spot after shedding 40lbs with daily workouts and a disciplined diet.

That wasn't my goal. It was more that, emotionally, I just wanted to feel strong,\" Khloe said of her weight loss back in June 2016. \nHaving been pegged as the curvy one in a family full of slim Kardashian children, Khloe initially found it difficult to motivate herself. \n\"I was always like, 'Oh I'm big boned'. But once I started losing weight naturally, I was like, wow, OK, now I'm going to get a trainer. Then six months later, I was like, I'm going to get a nutritionist.\" Khloe even did a racy photoshoot with sister Kim to show off her newly slimmed down body (Photo: Instagram/kardashianpedia) \nWhile her gruelling workouts and strict diets – including getting up at 5am every day and not eating until 8am, after her first gym session – have paid off for Khloe, the TV personality said it didn't come easily to start with. \n\"The first 45 days you're like, 'F*** this',\" she revealed in 2015. \n\"But it's just as much for all my critics who called me 'the fat one' for my entire existence.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T08:15:28.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
