Well, good news: Disney is publishing two new novels for young audiences that will give insight into the lives of Jyn, Chirrut, and Baze before they became heroes of the Rebellion. Advertisement \nAnnounced through StarWars.com today, two new books out in March will uncover the lives of three members of the main Rogue One cast—Jyn in a solo adventure, and another with Chirrut and Baze—before the events of the movie. Written by Beth Nevis, the YA-focused Rebel Rising will cover Jyn’s life between the prologue of the film, where she’s left alone following the death of her mother and capture of her father at the hands of Orson Krennic, as she works her way into the Rebel cell operated by Saw Gerrera: \nWhen Jyn Erso was five years old, her mother was murdered and her father taken from her to serve the Empire. But despite the loss of her parents she is not completely alone—Saw Gerrera, a man willing to go to any extremes necessary in order to resist Imperial tyranny, takes her in as his own, and gives her not only a home but all the abilities and resources she needs to become a rebel herself. \nJyn dedicates herself to the cause—and the man. But fighting alongside Saw and his people brings with it danger and the question of just how far Jyn is willing to go as one of Saw’s soldiers. When she faces an unthinkable betrayal that shatters her world, Jyn will have to pull the pieces of herself back together and figure out what she truly believes in…and who she can really trust. \nMeanwhile, the middle-school targeted Guardians of the Whills , written by Greg Rucka, will follow Chirrut and Baze’s lives as members of the titular order, having witnessed the arrival of the Empire on Jedha—but as Saw’s rebels make their presence on the planet known, they find themselves given a new opportunity to defend Jedha City from the Empire’s grasp. Advertisement \nBaze and Chirrut used to be Guardians of the Whills, who looked after the Kyber Temple on Jedha and all those who worshipped there. Then the Empire came and took over the planet. The temple was destroyed and the people scattered. Now Baze and Chirrut do what they can to resist the Empire and protect the people of Jedha, but it never seems to be enough. When a man named Saw Gerrera arrives with grand plans to take down the Empire, it seems like the perfect way for Baze and Chirrut to make a real difference and help the people of Jedha. But will it come at too great a cost? \nWhile some might pass them off as not “full” novels as they’re aimed at younger readers, it’s cool to see the world of Rogue One explored in books aimed at audiences that aren’t the usual Star Wars novel market—plus, it’s always nice to see more of these characters beyond their roles in the movie. Guardians of the Whills and Rebel Rising will be out May 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T01:38:10.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
