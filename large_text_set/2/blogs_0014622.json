Leila de Lima were not politically motivated, Malacañang said yesterday, as it scored international watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) for supposedly ignoring the seriousness of the drug problem in the Philippines. \nHRW has asked the Duterte administration to “immediately drop” what it described as the “politically motivated” cases filed by the justice department against De Lima, a staunch critic of the President’s anti-drug war. \nAccording to the New York-based group, the charges stemmed from “political vindictiveness” that debases the “rule of law” in the country. \n“Drug cases do not involve one’s political beliefs. It involves one’s choice to be involved in illegal drugs,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said in a statement. \n“De Lima’s case is not politically motivated. It is, simply put, criminal in nature. The human rights organization might bear that in mind before it attempts to obligate the Duterte administration,” he added. \nEchoing Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, Abella said it is wrong for De Lima to refer to herself as a political prisoner.   \nLast week, the justice department filed three criminal cases with the Muntinlupa regional trial court against De Lima and officials of the Bureau of Corrections and the National Bureau of Investigation for their alleged involvement in the drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison. \nDe Lima was accused of violating the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, which prohibits the sale, administration, dispensation, distribution and transportation of illegal drugs. \nAbella said HRW “blithely ignored” the approximately one million drug users and dealers who surrendered, as well as the discovery of industrial size illegal drug factories and the unmasking of “narco politics” that “has gripped local politics, law enforcement and to some extent the legislative and judicial departments.” \nHe also criticized HRW for calling on foreign governments to denounce the Duterte administration for its supposed disregard for basic human rights.
