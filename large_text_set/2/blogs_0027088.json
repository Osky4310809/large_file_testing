Out on the red carpet of the 89 th Academy Awards, these Hollywood leading ladies have left no highlighter unused or fringe unturned to dish out perfect 10s that will give birth to a million “how-to” videos. And while the predicted best actress of the year, Emma Stone, stunned and how, there were quite a few other major sartorial wins also claimed. Here’s looking at the best-dressed women from the biggest night of the awards season … the 2017 Oscars! Emma Stone in Givenchy \nEmma Stone picked a Givenchy fringe dress that ensured all eyes were affixed on her. 20s hair and a bright red lip finished out the actress’ Oscar night-out. Taraji P. Henson in Alberta Ferreti \nBefriending a whole lot of décolletage and its sexier cousin, the thigh-high slit, Taraji stepped out wearing a black dress that sat beautifully on her curves. Her short do was accompanied by heavy-duty diamond jewels by Nirav Modi. Ruth Negga in Valentino \nThe actress secured herself a definite spot on the best–dressed list wearing a Victorian inspired, red gown that was complemented by a ruby headband. Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton Sporting a cap-sleeved black gown, the actress paired the deceivingly good-girl silhouette (featuring a rise-and fall hemline) with chunky lace-up heels and a fresh AF face. Viola Davis in Armani Privé Viola Davis picked a vermillion gown for the big night that had us at the cold-shoulder detail and the mini trail. Jessica Biel in Kaufman Franco \nGoing for head-to-toe gold, the actress styled her show-stopping gown with sleek hair and neck-framing jewellery. Octavia Spencer in Marchesa \nOctavia’s shoulder-baring number had gorgeous Forevermark earrings for company. Her minimal styling is something we all can aspire to. Brie Larson in Oscar de la Renta \nBrie is not contending this year but her body sculpting, ruffled black gown urges us to still root for her. Emma Roberts in Armani Privé \nMonochrome for the red-carpet, together with a plunging neckline and tiered skirt, is always a good idea, as demonstrated by the actress here. Janelle Monae in Ellie Saab \nMonae’s sheer ball gown is tailor-made for a princess – only the princess is a pop-music sensation who is badass on all accounts and prefers black and sartorial mayhem over dainty pastels. Salma Hayek in Alexander McQueen \nPicking a sheer number by the label, the actress looked like she had walked straight out of a romantic novel. Karlia Kloss in Stella McCartney \nWearing all-white everything, Karlie picked a minimal cape gown and styled it with a face-framing choker for her Oscars’ outing.
