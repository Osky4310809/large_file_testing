They took my freezer about an hour to completely freeze. Thank you so much for sharing. My kids absolutely loved them.\" MY REVIEW cook4my5kidsandhub User ID: 6650348 69432 Reviewed Sep. 25, 2012 \n\"These are wonderful. I make these all of the time as part of my make-ahead meals. I love using leftover bread from making bread in my bread machine, and also leftover hot dog buns, separated. I just freeze any leftover bread to use to make these sticks when I have time. Perfect, everyone loves them!\" MY REVIEW rodricat User ID: 3743046 69431 Reviewed Jul. 29, 2012 \n\"Easy, quick and gone in the wink of an eye. My kids love to dip them in syrup, but of course they love anything they can eat with their hands.\" MY REVIEW sg1 User ID: 4775535 82277 Reviewed Sep. 5, 2010 \n\"My whole family loved this recipe and we will make it again! Next time I will try not cutting the bread into sticks until after they are frozen to make less work.\" MY REVIEW Lin-Dser User ID: 787535 135669 Reviewed Jun. 16, 2009 \n\"I tried this recipe again--it was so good and so easy to prepare, I had to give it another try. This time I used the optional cornflakes. That solved the sticking problem and now I have great tasting french toast that I can throw in the oven at any time. Incidentally, we make our own bread . If the bread goes stale before we can eat it all, I throw it in the freezer until I have time to make french toast or croutons out of it.\" MY REVIEW Lin-Dser User ID: 787535 69429 Reviewed Mar. 4, 2009 \n\"The french toast tasted great, but it stuck to the baking sheet every time I made it. If I make it again, I'll fry it on the stove top.\" Similar Recipes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T07:14:23.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
