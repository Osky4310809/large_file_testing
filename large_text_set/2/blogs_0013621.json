Unless you’re a teacher, then you should probably stay away from FMK, especially when you make it the game about the underage teens that you are supposed to mold into upstanding citizens. \nWe take you to Bangor, Michigan where a group of teachers was caught on video playing “Fuck, Marry, Kill” about their students. These educators played the risque game while throwing back drinks at a local bar. \nFrom the New York Post : \nThe teachers and at least one secretary from Bangor High School can be overheard naming the students — including special-needs kids — as they played the lewd game at a local gin joint, according to a six-minute video filmed by a customer and posted to YouTube.\n“Oh, I would fuck [student’s name],” a woman can be heard saying in the clip.\nA man at the table is heard identifying the three students he would “bone,” “marry” and “kill.”\n“I would totally marry [student’s name] because she likes the Tigers and she never even brought up that I was wasted on the bus trip … she can keep secrets,” another man says.\nHow hard are the kids who were picked to get killed by their teachers going to fucked with tomorrow at school?\nTwo teachers received a written reprimand and others were verbally reprimanded. \nDuring the school board’s meeting on Monday night, outraged parents called for the teachers to be fired and district officials to resign.\n“I would like to see people being held accountable,” said Amanda Reprogal, the mother of a special needs student. “There are some criminal charges being pressed. I’m not sure how that’s going to go, but I don’t want to see anybody lose their job, but this is not okay, you got to go.”\nThe board refuses to take further action against the teacher gang from Bangor.\n“I say that we made our best assessment based on the facts and reasonable minds can differ about things,” said district lawyer Robert Huber .\nWSJM is reporting that two teachers have since resigned following the outrage over the controversial video. One of them was formally reprimanded, while the other received a verbal reprimand. The school board still has to accept their resignations.\nThe Bangor School Board accepted the resignation of a secretary who was caught on video playing FMK.\nAnd these teachers are a little too cocky for my tastes. I looked at some of the teachers and there didn’t seem to be any super models in the group, and based on how often teachers get caught having sex with their teenage students they aren’t exactly the marrying type. \n\n[ NYP ]\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:11:28.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
