Last week, the Chinese e-commerce giant, which remains on the radar of numerous consumer protection agencies, filed lawsuits against two vendors that are believed to have sold fake Swarovski watches on its online shopping platform Taobao. (See also: Alibaba Takes Two Counterfeiters to Court .) \nThis move by the company, although in its initial stages, signifies that Alibaba wants to be taken seriously. Accordingly, Alibaba stock has attracted renewed buying interest. The shares closed Friday at $93.89, which translates to rise of 6.86% from last week's close of $87.81, besting the 1.7% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index. Can the stock's recovery continue? \nDespite the strong rise to start the year, Alibaba shares are still down more than 12% in the past three months. From a valuation perspective, which puts the shares at 28 times forward estimates, or ten points above the S&P 500 index, Alibaba shares aren't in the bargain bin. However, that doesn't mean they should be avoided either, particularly given the company's strong projected growth rate. (See also: Alibaba's 2016: A Year in Review .) \nBased on fiscal 2017 earnings per share estimates of $4.13, Alibaba is projected to grow earnings at almost 27% year over year. This would translate to almost five times the S&P 500's projected growth rate of around 5%. What's more, Alibaba’s projected fiscal 2017 revenue of $28.85 billion would mark a rise of about 30% year over year. \nIn other words, although Alibaba stock is pricey, the company is producing value. To the extent that it can continue to improve its reputation, the stock's credibility will rise too. This explains the stock's consensus Buy rating and average price target of $121.50, suggesting 30% premiums from current levels.
