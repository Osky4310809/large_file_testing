This comes on the heels of Congress’s controversial decision to repeal internet privacy rules that kept ISPs from selling your browsing histories to third parties.\nPorn sites have long focused on their own security, since they’re frequently targeted by hackers, and any breaches threaten to expose very sensitive data about their customers. But this is sign they’re working to offer even further protection to their users. YouPorn, which is owned by the same parent company, will also switch to the same protocol on April 4th. \nSEE ALSO: Goodbye internet privacy, we hardly knew you \nCorey Price, Pornhub’s Vice President, explained in a statement, “We wanted to continue our concerted effort to maximize the privacy of our users, ensuring that what they do on our platform remains strictly confidential. With the switch to HTTPS we are able to protect their identity as well as safeguard them against exposure to malware by third parties.”\nEnabling HTTPS will not keep your ISP from seeing you’ve visited Pornhub, but it will keep them from being able to see what kind of content you’ve consumed while there. That’s useful if you’d rather not have your love of videos like \"Filthy fashion models\" or \"Mom rides her dentist and begs for creampie\" be made widely available.\nSEE ALSO: Pornhub wants to be the hottest destination for sex ed \nA recent transparency report from Google showed that out of the 11 major adult sites, only three were using HTTPS. Now Pornhub and YouPorn will join that list. And this will undoubtedly continue to be a trend across the entire industry.\nAfter all, your porn histories are among your most sacred possessions, and you don’t want it falling into the hands of just anyone.\nWATCH: Tech reporter tries VR porn, may never be the same again", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-04-01T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T19:19:48.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
