It is designed as a guide for planning and understanding each aspect of your ceremony. I've tried to include every possible element of the ceremony, however, not all of these must be incorporated into your service, nor do they have to occur in this order. You may choose to add your own personal expression that will give special meaning to your commitment as a couple. \nYour Christian wedding ceremony can be individually tailored, but ought to include expressions of worship, reflections of joy, celebration, community, respect, dignity and love. \nThe Bible gives no specific pattern or order to define exactly what should be included, so there's room for your creative touches. A primary goal should be to give each guest a clear impression that you, as a couple, have made a solemn, eternal covenant with each other before God. Your wedding ceremony should be a testimony of your lives before God, demonstrating your Christian witness. Pre-Wedding Ceremony Events \nWedding Party Pictures This should begin at least 90 minutes prior to the start of the wedding and be finished at least 45 minutes before the ceremony. \nMore Resources for Wedding Party Pictures \nWedding Party Dressed and Ready The wedding party should be dressed, ready and waiting in the appropriate locations at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the ceremony. \nPrelude Any musical preludes or solos should take place at least 5 minutes prior to the start of the ceremony. \nMore Resources for Christian Wedding Music \nLighting of the Candles Sometimes the candles or candelabras are lit before the guests arrive. Other times the ushers light them as part of the prelude, or as part of the wedding ceremony.\nThe Wedding Ceremony \nTo gain a deeper understanding of your Christian wedding ceremony and to make your special day even more meaningful, you may want to spend some time learning the biblical significance of today's Christian wedding traditions . Processional Seating of the Parents Having the support and involvement of parents and grandparents in the ceremony brings a special blessing to the couple and also expresses honor to the previous generations of marriage unions.The processional music begins with the seating of the honored guests: Seating of the Groom's grandmother Seating of the Bride's grandmother Seating of the Groom's parents Seating of the Bride's mother Bridal Processional Begins Minister and Groom enter usually from stage right. If the Groomsmen are not escorting the Bridesmaids down the aisle to the altar, they also enter together with the Minister and Groom. Bridesmaids enter, usually down the center aisle, one at a time. If the Groomsmen are escorting the Bridesmaids, they enter together. Maid or Matron of Honor enters. If she is being escorted by the Best Man, they enter together. Flower Girl and Ring Bearer enter. Wedding March Begins The Bride and her father enter. Typically the Bride's mother will stand as a signal for all of the guests to stand. Sometimes the Minister will announce, \"All rise for the Bride.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T18:26:39.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
