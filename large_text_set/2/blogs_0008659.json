I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,\" Flynn said in his resignation letter. \nFlynn's discussions had raised a possible breach of the Logan Act, a 1799 law that bars unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. However, a senior intelligence official last week told NBC News there had been no finding that Flynn did anything illegal. \nAfter \"agonizing\" for days over the situation, Trump and his top advisers concluded Flynn's position had become unsustainable because he had lied to the president and the vice president, another senior official told NBC News Monday night. \nA senior official also confirmed part of a Washington Post report that Sally Yates, then-acting attorney general, told the White House last month that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail. Trump fired Yates after she directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the president's executive order on immigration. \nThere was barely-concealed glee in some quarters over the departure of Flynn — an outspoken opponent of political correctness who last year wrote on Twitter that \"fear of Muslims is rational.\" \nRepublican Rep. Bill Flores of Texas said he was \"glad\" Flynn had gone, adding: \"We need more sanctions on Russia, not fewer!\" \nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee — which is investigating the Trump campaign's alleged contacts with Russia — said Flynn's resignation was \"all but ordained the day he misled the country about his secret talks with the Russian ambassador.\" Breaking: text of Flynn's resignation letter pic.twitter.com/KGue1cJFzL — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 14, 2017 \n\"In fact, Flynn was always a poor choice for National Security Adviser, a role in which you need to be a consensus builder, and possess sobriety and steady judgment,\" Schiff said in a statement. \"It is certainly no role for someone who plays fast and loose with the truth.\" \nHowever, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, thanked Flynn for his \"many years of distinguished service.\" 10 PHOTOS Reaction to Michael Flynn's resignation See Gallery Reaction to Michael Flynn's resignation Michael Flynn has resigned as Trump's national security adviser.
