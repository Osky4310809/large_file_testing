Much like Donald Trump's ironic tweet about the 2015 Oscars resurfaced during the award show this year, one of Kellyanne Conway's social media posts about FBI investigations is seeing the light of day again.\nBack in October 2016 — when the FBI announced it was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails — Conway threw some major shade at Clinton, claiming that \"most honest people\" she knows are not investigated by the FBI.\nMost honest people I know are not under FBI investigation, let alone two. https://t.co/UcSmSA5aTj\n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 29, 2016\n. @KellyannePolls on HRC: \"If you're under your 2nd FBI investigation in the same year then you do have a…corruption & an ethics problem.\" pic.twitter.com/bWv0d0bGlY\n— Fox News (@FoxNews) October 29, 2016\nRelated:\nNow Is the Perfect Time to Resurface This 2012 Tweet From Donald Trump\nThis is some top-notch irony considering the fact that the very man she is the counselor to has been under investigation for his ties to Russia .
