But as we get older, a second protein called DBC1 sticks to it, making it unable to complete its recon work. As a result, our ability to fix broken DNA dwindles. \nIn their experiment , the scientists fed old mice—the human equivalent of about 80 years old—a molecule called NMN. The mice metabolized it into a signaling molecule called NAD, which wedged itself between the PARP1 and DBC1 proteins and pried them apart. As a result, the DNA-repairing protein was able to work effectively again, just as it did when the mice were younger. (This exact workout might help reverse aging, too .) \n“This restored the DNA capacity of the old mouse back to a young mouse, and also to remove the DNA damage that accumulated in the tissue,” study author David Sinclair, Ph.D., explained in the video . \nThen, the scientists exposed the mice to radiation, which is known to damage DNA. The mice who were treated with the NMN molecule didn’t show the typical effects of radiation, including changes in white blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels. \nThat’s likely the findings that have excited NASA, according to a press release from the University of New South Wales. That’s because cosmic radiation in outer space missions is a particular challenge, since it can damage DNA and possibly leave to cancer . In fact, back in December, Sinclair’s lab won national honors in NASA’s iTech competition for their research on limiting cosmic radiation exposure. \nSo far, the treatment has only been tested in mice, and the scientists caution that the results in humans may be different. Still, the researchers hope to begin human trials with the NMN treatment within six months. (These are the best anti-aging secrets for every cell in your body .) \n“This is the closest we are to a safe and effective anti-ageing drug that’s perhaps only three to five years away from being on the market if the trials go well,” Sinclair said in the release. \nIf the results in humans hold up, the drug may serve as a path to further treatments to prevent DNA damage associated with aging, radiation from space or cancer treatments, and even some types of chemotherapy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T01:37:18.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
