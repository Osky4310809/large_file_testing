In fact, quite the opposite. Over the weekend, Guwop stopped by ESPN’s interview segment “Highly Questionable” to discuss his dark past with extreme candor. Watch the full interview below.\n. @gucci1017 joined us for an honest discussion about his recovery from addiction…then talked to Papi about his Bart Simpson chain. pic.twitter.com/Jd5OYHCxCs \n— Highly Questionable (@HQonESPN) January 6, 2017 \n\nWhen talking about his career before his prison sentence, Gucci described it as a “blur of violence and paranoia and drugs,” one that he is currently experiencing PTSD from. He also tackled his past addiction with lean, of which he says he is “100 percent” surprised that it did not kill him.\nSince his release, Gucci has an unbelievably prolific year. 2016 saw the release of Everybody Looking , Woptober and The Return of East Atlanta Santa . And those are just his solo albums. At this rate, expect an even dozen releases from Guwop this year.\nRevisit the video for “Last Time” featuring Travis Scott and a cameo from director Harmony Korine below.\n\nIn other music news, Donald Glover gave some serious (and surprising) love to another mainstay of the Atlanta rap scene in his Golden Globes acceptance speech. See what he had to say right here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-09T13:32:38.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
