CAAP on Friday afternoon, March 10, then extended the temporary shutdown up to 12 am of March 12, prompting airlines to cancel more flights . \nCaptain Manuel Antonio Tamayo, CAAP deputy director general for operations, assured the public that his agency is \"doing its utmost best to provide safe, secure, and convenient air travel for everybody.\" \nCAAP said the radar repair covered \"the overhauling of antenna and replacement of its drive motor and rotary joint.\" \nThe repair was necessary, as the radar will be integrated with the satellite-based Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) systems that will be launched soon, added the agency. \nThe CNS/ATM systems, explained CAAP, \"enable aircraft operators to meet their planned times of departure and arrival, and adhere to their preferred flight profiles with minimum constraints and without compromising agreed levels of safety.\" \nThe P9-billion CNS/ATM facility, assisted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), will be turned over to CAAP management by main contractor Sumitomo-Thales JV by July, said the statement. \n\"When fully operational, the facility can monitor 80 percent of the Manila Flight Information Region as assigned to the Philippines by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),\" CAAP said. \nThe Tagaytay radar is one of 3 used by CAAP in guiding flights approaching airports at NAIA and Clark International Airport. The other two radars are in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte, and in Mt Majic, Cebu City, said CAAP. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
