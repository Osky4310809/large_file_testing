I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying, ‘Trump is right.'” Advertisement - story continues below Franklin Graham: It Wasn’t Donald Trump Who Divided This Nation \nTrump’s criticism in the London Times interview didn’t solely center on how NATO battles extremism. \nEchoing a common theme from his campaign, Trump highlighted that 23 of the 28 member nations were not paying their fair share to sustain the alliance. \n“A lot of these countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States,” Trump lamented.

Five. It’s not much.” \nMedia outlets around the world have seized on Trump’s “obsolete” remark to try and find daylight between Trump and his cabinet nominees. \nOn Monday, CNN reported “the clear gulf between Trump’s characterization of the alliance and that of his Cabinet nominees could set-up potential policy clashes with the White House.” Advertisement - story continues below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T00:54:28.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
