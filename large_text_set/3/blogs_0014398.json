Jason Pollock: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published Updated 4:41 pm EDT, March 14, 2017 41 Comments By Tom Cleary 11.5k Share Tweet Follow Mike Brown’s mother Lezley McSpadden and Director Jason Pollock speak on the red carpet for the premiere of the film ‘Stranger Fruit” during day two of The South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference held at the VIMEO Theater in Austin, Texas, March 11, 2017. (Getty) \nA new documentary about the death of Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson in 2014, is raising new questions about what Brown was doing before he was killed, the New York Times reports. \nThe film, “Stranger Fruit,” is directed by Jason Pollock, and includes never-before-seen security camera footage from the Ferguson Market, where police have claimed Brown committed a robbery before his death. Pollock, 35, says the robbery never happened, and the video shows Brown engaging in a drug deal with the store’s employees. \nThe video was recorded about 1 a.m. on August 9, 2014. Another surveillance video recording from the Ferguson Market showed Brown in the store again about 11:50 p.m. that same day. Police said he stole a box of cigars from the store during that second trip to the store, but Pollock, in the documentary, argues that no robbery occurred, it was part of a barter deal struck during Brown’s first stop at the market. Brown was fatally shot about noon after leaving the store. \nSt. Louis County District Attorney Robert McCulloch will be releasing the full surveillance video and said at a press conference it does not change the case at all. He said the video was already known to investigators. McCulloch said the footage in the documentary was “poorly edited,” and it was a “pathetic attempt” by the filmmaker. \nHe said the video is “certainly not relevant or material to anything that occurred later in the day,” and was never publicly released because it was not presented to the grand jury investigating Brown’s death. McCulloch said the video would not have been admissible in a criminal trial. Police did include information about the video in reports about the shooting, including a description of it, which led Pollock to the video. \nA civil suit in the case is still ongoing. \nHere’s what you need to know about Pollock and the film: 1. The Documentary Debuted at South by Southwest & the New Video Led to Protests at the Ferguson Market Cousin Sandra Abron, Attorney Benjamin Crump, Lezley McSpadden (mother of Mike Brown), and director Jason Pollock pose on the red carpet for the premiere of the film ‘Stranger Fruit” during day two of The South by Southwest (SXSW) Conference held at the VIMEO Theater in Austin, Texas, March 11, 2017. (Getty) \nThe documentary debuted this weekend at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. \nYou can watch the video of Michael Brown at the Ferguson market below: \n“There was some type of exchange, for one thing, for another,” Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, says in Mr. Pollock’s documentary, according to the Times. \n“They destroyed Michael’s character with the tape, and they didn’t show us what actually happened,” Pollock told the Times. “So this shows their intention to make him look bad. And shows suppression of evidence.” \nPollock spent two years working on the documentary, originally called “The Ferguson Cover-Up,” examining what happened before, during and after the incident, including the decision by prosecutors to not charge Wilson. \nPollock w rote on the Huffington Post that “like many in America,” Brown’s death “truly changed my life forever. That day the world shifted a bit and started rotating in a slightly different direction. The winds changed and since that day we have seen some pretty historic things taking place around America.” \nHe said he spent the past two years living in Ferguson while working on the documentary. \nThe release of the new video led to protests Sunday night outside the Ferguson Market. Arrests were made and a Ferguson police officer suffered a broken nose, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Shots were fired twice from across the street, but no one was hit. \nJay Kanzler, the attorney for the Ferguson Market, said he plans to release the full, unedited surveillance video on Monday.

He claimed many people have seen it, including Brown’s family. “This isn’t new.” \nKanzler told the New York Times, “There was no transaction. There was no understanding. No agreement. Those folks didn’t sell him cigarillos for pot. The reason he gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T01:03:27.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
