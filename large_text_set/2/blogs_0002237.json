Matthews said politics have become so polarized that is natural to assume there will be a filibuster against Judge Gorsuch. \"I think this is going to come down, to a sad denouement,\" Matthews said Tuesday night. \"I think it's going to take 60 votes to get this approved and I think the Republicans will have their rank-and-file 52 votes will be there. But I don't think the Democrats are going to give them a single vote which mean this will go to a filibuster.\" \"I don't think they'll get 60 votes because I don't think they'll get a single Democratic vote, Chris. Not a one,\" Matthews said. CHRIS MATTHEWS: I think this is going to come down, Chris, to a sad denouement. I think it's going to take 60 votes to get this approved and I think the Republicans will have their rank-and-file 52 votes will be there. But I don't think the Democrats are going to give them a single vote which mean this will go to a filibuster and then -- and I hate to cut to the chase but I will -- it's going to be up to Mitch McConnell. He's going to have to choose between something he deeply believes in. He really believes as an institutionalist in the Senate the need to make the Senate different than the House, to have a filibuster requirement of 60 votes that keeps it from being too extreme in either direction, requiring cabinet members, everybody has to go through that 60-vote requirement, that threshold. He's not going to give that away easily. Trump says he will but I don't think Mitch McConnell will so in the end it will be Mitch McConnell making a decision, do I give up the filibuster rule which requires 60 votes to get something through if that means giving up something I believe in, doing it just for Trump to get his first nominee through. I don't think he'll do it. I think Mitch McConnell will hold fast and say it will be 60 votes. This fellow, he's probably a good guy is very much like Antonin Scalia, a good person whatever you think of him, politically and ideologically, and I don't think it will get through to him because I don't think they'll get 60 votes because I don't think they'll get a single Democratic vote, Chris. Not a one. Because this country is so polarized now. You know it as well as I do. Look at the DeVos nomination for Education Secretary. You can just see united party fronts on this kind of vote, these ideological votes.
