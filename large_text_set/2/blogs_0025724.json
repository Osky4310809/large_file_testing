Well, they're not a thing of the past. Late Night 's Seth Meyers used his Closer Look segment on Wednesday night to examine the latest unsavory developments in Trump’s immigration policies, including his dedication to fulfilling that beloved campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border. \nAfter explaining that immigrants are actually less likely to be criminals and that more Mexicans are actually leaving the U.S. than entering it , Meyers chronicled the president’s continued struggle to find a contractor for his wildly impractical pet project . (Trump is apparently so desperate he’s resorted to sending “Man seeks wall builder” emails in all caps.) Meyers also noted that even some Republicans are still directly contradicting Trump’s own statements about the wall, with the Homeland Security Chief admitting parts of it will be transparent, and others still saying it won’t literally be a wall, but a metaphor for Trump’s crackdown on immigration.

But it doesn’t really matter, because it turns out the wall can be anything you want it to be . “Don’t you see, Dorothy? The wall was inside you all along ! You’re the wall! We’re all the wall!” \nAnd since Trump adviser Stephen Miller has assured us that the wall will pay for itself “many, many times over,” Meyers is absolutely right. We, the American people, really are all the wall—and we’ll wind up paying for ourselves, one way or another . \nMarissa Martinelli is a Slate editorial assistant.
