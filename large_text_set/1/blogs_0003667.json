Marco will be bringing in his own back-room team who have all played their part in his recent success. \n“We are already working hard with Marco and his team to deliver some key additions to our squad during this transfer window.” \nSilva has previously coached at Estoril, Sporting Lisbon and Olympiakos, leading the former to Portugal’s top flight, Sporting to the Portuguese cup in 2015 and the later to the Greek title last season. He left Olympiakos for personal reasons shortly after and thus was immediately available to Hull. \nSilva has no experience of English football and speaks only limited English but he will have to quickly get to grips with the task of keeping Hull in the top-flight. They are three points from safety and next face Bournemouth at the KCOM Stadium a week on Saturday. \nBefore that are two cup ties – the visit of Swansea in the third round of the FA Cup this Saturday and the EFL Cup semi-final first leg trip to Manchester United on Tuesday. Silva is expected to be in charge for both.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T14:50:38.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
