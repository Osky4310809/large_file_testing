Superpop, but obviously credible. I'm gonna put three or four boys together and do all the songs, take them on the stadium tour with me.\" Ed Sheeran and Stormzy performing (Photo: PA) \nAnd the Shape of You singer also revealed his plans to perform in “stadiums everywhere”. \nHe added: \"I want to do stadiums everywhere. Like George Strait's level – he tours every four years, does a couple of stadiums and then f**ks off again.\" \nWhatever songs Ed has written for his future boy band project will likely include some heart breaking tracks, as he recently admitted the “best songs” come from writing about pain.
