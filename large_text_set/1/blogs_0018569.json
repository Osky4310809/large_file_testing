We shower them with toys, love, yummy treats, and would do anything to ensure their well-being. But sadly, not everyone thinks of dogs in this way. For whatever reason, some people don’t see dogs as sweet, loving animals, and often give them up, sometimes even deserting them on the side of the road. \nRecently, Special Needs Animal Rescue & Rehabilitation , SNARR, a nonprofit organization based in New York found out about a homeless dog wandering by herself on the side of the road. Not only was this poor girl left to fend for herself, she was also in horrible condition . There was no question about it: SNARR would save her. The poor dog was found with chemical burns, or possibly a bacterial infection all over her skin. Now named Sophie, she will receive expert medical treatment. Thank goodness SNARR stepped in to save this adorable pup. This little cutie is now learning humans can, in fact, be kind. \n\n\nMany people don’t realize the extent of the pet homelessness issue in the U.S. While we love and adore the dogs we share our homes with, the fact that there are some 70 million stray cats and dogs living on the streets gets easily ignored. These animals, just like Sophie, need a loving home just as much as any other does, but sadly, they rarely get the chance. Of the six to eight million homeless animals that are brought into animal shelters a year, only a small fraction ever end up being adopted. \nPlease always spay and neuter your pets and urge your friends and family to do the same.
