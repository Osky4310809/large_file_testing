But if home prices are still in line with the economic fundamentals and likely to rise in the future, then buying makes more sense. \nThe index is contrarian. From 2004 to 2006 the index warned that renting was the best option everywhere, but most people remained enamored with buying. But by 2012 buying, for those who could pull it off, was a no-brainer, although many still viewed it as too risky. \nCurrently, in 15 of the 23 metro areas tracked, the index remains solidly in “buy” territory, with the trade-offs more mixed in another five. \nIn Denver, Dallas, and Houston, the index has swung in favor of renting in a way not seen since the middle of the last decade, right before the housing crash. Fitch Ratings last month placed Colorado in a group of 11 states where rapid price appreciation is increasing risk of new mortgage debt. \nThat said, Denver, Dallas and Houston never came close to the elevated levels on the index last decade that metros in south Florida and Southern California reached. Nor did they suffer as large a decline in home prices. Denver’s index score swung solidly in favor of renting in 2014, but home prices have continued to post double-digit gains since then.
