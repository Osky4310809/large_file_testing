What do you make of that?” Cooper asked. “Is it possible that the tough talk on illegal immigration by Trump is working, that he deserves credit for that drop?” \n\"These people calling their relatives and their friends, saying, “don’t come here, this is not the right moment.” So I think it is possible. Really no one wants illegal immigration, not even undocumented immigrants. It is very risky for them. It is better to do it in a legal way,\" Ramos responded in a shocking change of perspective. . @jorgeramosnews on border crossing down 40%: Fear is stronger than any wall.
