The security of your 1Password data remains safe and solid. \nWe will provide a more detailed description in the coming days of the CloudFlare security bug and how it (doesnâ€™t) affect 1Password. At the moment, we want to ensure and remind everyone that we designed 1Password with the expectation that SSL/TLS can fail. Indeed it is for incidents like this that we deliberately made this design. \nNo secrets are transmitted between 1Password clients and 1Password.com when you sign in and use the service. Our sign-in uses SRP, which means that server and client prove their identify to each other without transmitting any secrets. This means that users of 1Password do not need to change their Master Passwords. \nYour actual data is encrypted with three layers (including SSL/TLS), and the other two layers remain secure even if the secrecy of an SSL/TLS channel is compromised.
