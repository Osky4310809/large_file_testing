Right now we don’t have resources for that. It’s just a discussion,” Steele told visiting Filipino journalists in an interview at the USAID headquarters here Tuesday. \nSteele, former USAID mission director for the Philippines, stressed the agency understands that drug rehabilitation is a priority of President Duterte in his campaign against illegal drugs. \n“They (Philippine government) just said that’s an area they want to talk to us about but we don’t have resources. I didn’t say we’re not supporting. I said we have discussions going on,” she said.   \nSteele explained drug rehabilitation is not among USAID’s current priorities. \nSteele stressed the Philippines’ compliance with its human rights obligations is not a condition for USAID partnership or assistance. \n“It’s not a condition for assistance. We work with the Philippine government and the communities and universities based on what the needs are. We don’t condition our assistance,” she said. \nUSAID has not put on hold or placed under review ongoing programs in the Philippines, including health and education, Steele said. \nIn October, Duterte said the Philippines can live without US aid and he would rather die of hunger than accept aid from superpowers that meddle in his war against illegal drugs. \nHowever, Steele said the US side has not heard from the Philippine government that Duterte would no longer accept assistance from the US. \n“He has not told us that he’s not going to work with us and we really don’t call it aid per se but partnership. Our partners in government and the private sector have continued to be our partners,” Steele said. \n“We continue to have programs with them. No one has asked us to leave or discontinue and we continue to work together.” \nDuring the confirmation hearing last month of Rex Tillerson, US President Donald Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State, he did not directly acknowledge human rights abuses in the Philippines and the government’s war on drugs which has resulted in the killing of more than 6,200 suspected drug personalities in the last six months. \nTillerson said he could not pass judgment on the Philippines until he has access to US intelligence briefings. \nThe UN has expressed serious concern over extrajudicial killings of alleged drug dealers and users in the Philippines.
