It has failed and nobody appears willing to tackle the issue head-on towards a permanent resolution. \n“I have mandated the Senate Committee on Power to continue the consultation with the relevant parties to forge a path to solving our crippling power deficit. After all, if we are going to drive Nigerian industry, we need to resolve this and fast.” \nSaraki said for a private sector-led economy to thrive, there was the need to reform the policy environment to give investors and businessmen and women ample adjustment time to make informed investment decisions rather than have uncertainties. \nHe noted that this was especially important in the agriculture and solid mineral sectors, where there were significant economies of scale and opportunities for diversification of our economy. \nDescribing the petroleum industry as critical to the health of the nation’s economy, Saraki said the Senate wanted the executive to take positive steps to begin a “meaningful dialogue” with those aggrieved in the Niger Delta. \n“The proposed engagement, we suggest must be sincere, constructive, open and confidence building. This Senate is willing to assist and play whatever role necessary to facilitate a successful agreement that would help us see to the end if the lingering conflict,” he said. \nHe thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for showing faith with the work of the National Assembly by signing 16 of the bills passed by the legislature into law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T14:33:26.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
