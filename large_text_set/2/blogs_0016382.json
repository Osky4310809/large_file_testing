Later, both of us went to the Island. It was on our way back that a commercial bus hit the bike that we boarded and she fell, hitting her head on the ground. \n“When we got home, she started complaining of pain in the head and then she died. I didn’t take her to the hospital because I didn’t have money. Sakiru Bello \n“After she died, I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call her family members since we aren’t in good terms. It was while thinking about what to do that a thought came into my mind that I should cut her corpse into pieces to enable me dispose off her remains easily. \n“So I cut her head, her breast, her leg and other parts of her body. I later wrapped them in a sack before taking it to an uncompleted building, where I buried the parts in different holes.” \nFather-in-law \nAccording to the father of the deceased, “I reported the case to the Area ‘B’ Police Command, when we didn’t see her, not knowing that he had killed her. When we called him, he said he was somewhere in Ibadan and gave us an address. \n“However, when we got to the address, he was not there. Luckily, police arrested him in Lagos where he was hiding. He is denying that he killed her, but he cut her corpse into bits. All we want is proper investigation and justice in this case.” \nLamenting, the elder sister of the deceased, Shakirat, told Vanguard : “My sister is a nurse. She is the one who has been catering for the family, while they were married. She once bought him a bike and later, a Danfo just to ensure that he is gainfully employed. But nothing came out of it. \n“About a year ago, she raised alarm that he wanted to use her for rituals, so the two families came together and they separated them.” \nIt will be recalled that Shakiru Bello was alleged to have dismembered the wife’s body and buried same in a shallow grave, before leaving for Ibadan, his home town.
