Previously spotted in December and last month , the SUV is still running on trade plates, though the covering tape on all badging has been completely dropped, which possibly indicates that a debut doesn’t look to be very far away. \nAs previously reported, the new Typ 5N 16 – which was unveiled at the 2015 IAA in Frankfurt – will be launched here as a locally-assembled (CKD) model this year, rolling out of the Volkswagen Malaysia Automotive Assembly Plant in Pekan, Pahang. \nSitting on VW Group’s modular MQB platform, which also underpins the Golf Mk7 , the new Tiguan is much larger than its predecessor, being 60 mm longer, 30 mm wider and having a 77 mm longer wheelbase, but the increase in dimensions hasn’t brought about a weight penalty – the new car is actually more than 50 kg lighter than before. \nLike with the previous-gen, the Tiguan should come equipped with a 1.4 litre TSI mill for our market, the 280 TSI badging notwithstanding (the B8 Passat with the same numerical descriptor sold here wears a 1.8 litre unit). The engine is available in two states of output tune, but the more familiar one should be the 150 PS and 250 Nm one. \nThe SUV is available in three trim levels in other markets – Trendline, Comfortline and Highline – but we’ll have to wait and see just exactly what Malaysians will receive. Earlier spyshots have revealed the front end of the vehicle, offering an idea of what kit to expect when the model finally debuts – items include LED headlamps (with DRLs) and front fog lamps. \nGALLERY: Volkswagen Tiguan GTE and R-Line at 2015 IAA Frankfurt Research Volkswagen Cars at", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T11:04:37.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
