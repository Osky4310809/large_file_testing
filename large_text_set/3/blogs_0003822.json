The man was later arrested.\nThe airline initially considered hiring private security guards to help protect its employees, but then dropped the plan because it would have increased the cost of plane tickets by up to 2 percent.\n“We’ve found a better option (than a private security company) and will train employees [in] sambo and judo. In this case, we will not have to raise ticket prices,” Pobeda chief Andrey Kalmykov told Russian news site Vedomosti.\nParent company Aeroflot has repeatedly argued for increased penalties for unruly passengers.\nSambo is an acronym of samozashchita bez oruzhiya, which translates to “self-defense without weapons.” Its arsenal of moves includes strikes, joint locks, chokes, throws and ground fighting.\nJudo, which means “gentle way,” was developed in Japan in 1882. Its objective is to throw or take down opponents using holds and leverage.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:21:12.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
