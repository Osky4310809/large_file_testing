To the relief of his friends and family, Will returns home safely following a short hospital stay. \nBut cryptic — and even downright confusing — cliffhangers suggest all is not well in Hawkins, Indiana. That’s bad for the characters fans have come to love, but good for us who can’t wait to see what happens next. Most Popular Police kill man who opened fire with rifle in Oakland \nAnd now we’ve gotten a few more choice tidbits. Netflix released a teaser trailer for Season 2 during Super Bowl 51 that showed a few details and confirmed a few theories. But those details have kicked up a whole new set of questions, and fans have dug deep into the info to formulate all new ideas about Season 2. \nHere are nine of the most interesting fan theories, circulating on Reddit , predicting where Season 2 of the critically acclaimed Duffer brothers’ series is heading. Also Read: 'Stranger Things' Season 2: Everything We Know (and a Few Guesses) \n1. Eleven is alive, but she’s in serious trouble \nThe Super Bowl 51 trailer confirmed what everyone suspected: Eleven   survived her encounter with the Demogorgon creature in Season 1, and she’ll be coming back in Season 2. Show creators Matt and Ross Duffer have said we’ll see more of Elle’s background and origins. And given the way Mike (Finn Wolfhard) seemed distressed about Eleven in first season, it seems very likely that finding and saving Eleven will be another element that looms large in Season 2. \n2. Eleven is inextricably tied to the Upside Down \nShe said it herself in an early episode — that she’s the monster. We discover more toward the end of Season 1 during a flashback, when Elle touches the faceless creature for the first time after entering an alternate world through a sensory tank at the local government lab. It’s that contact with the demogorgon that has fans thinking that’s when she was infiltrated by its darkness. With more Upside Down creeping into Hawkins and Eleven back for sure, the idea that there’s more to her relationship with the monsters is gaining some traction.

The Thessalhydra from ‘D&D’ is Season 2’s monster \nFans paid very close attention to the final   game of Season 1, in which Will defeated a creature called the “Thessalhydra.” Like the hydra of Greek myth, the Thessalhydra has several heads (eight, in fact), and regenerates them after they get cut off. The giant creature shown in the Super Bowl teaser looks an awful lot like it could be a multi-headed hydra monster. And according to fan theories, that last “D&D” game was foreshadowing the monster in Season 2. That part refers to how Will managed to take out seven of the Thessalhydra’s head in the game, accidentally leaving one behind to allow the creature to regenerate. \n4. Nancy Wheeler may ultimately wind up with Jonathan Byers \nSure, the show ends with Nancy (Natalia Dyer) in Steve Harrington’s arms, but one observant fan noted her distant stare as he held her in his arms. Just seconds prior, she had given a special gift to Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) — a still camera to replace the one that Steve (Joe Keery) cruelly broke in an earlier episode. The fact remains, Jonathan and Nancy were the ones to team up against the monster and Steve only barged in on their plot unwittingly at the last minute. The two have a strong connection. \n5. Barb’s disappearance will be a major problem \nThe small amount of information trickling out about Season 2 has confirmed one thing: Barb’s dead. Bummer. Fans have been demanding #JusticeForBarb and the Duffer Brothers have said Barb will get it in Season 2. But from what we’ve heard so far, there might be more than justice. Barb’s disappearance sounds like it looms large over Hawkins, Indiana, affecting the town in Season 2. It also sounds like Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) has been covering up the circumstances of Barb’s death and Will’s disappearance to protect the Byers. Or at least, that’s how it seems.

Will Byers is part monster now \nWe see Will cough up one of those slimy things from the Upside Down world in which he resided for nearly the entire season. Then the bathroom in which he’s standing flickers, bringing the world’s creepy darkness into view momentarily. Will looks concerned, then he returns to his mom and brother acting completely normal. If the above fan theory No. 2 is true, it stands to reason that since Will was in contact with the faceless monster, that he too has a touch of its evil magic inside of him. Clips from the teaser suggest to fans that Will has some connection with the giant Season 2 monster shown there, too, as does the “Thessalhydra” theory. \n7. Hopper works for the government now \nHe’s spotted stepping into a car with a couple of the bad guys from the lab. Earlier on Hopper cut a deal with them to keep their nefarious secrets under wraps in exchange for Will, so this isn’t a huge leap. Still, it could play out several different ways. Some fans think he’s infiltrating the organization in attempts of taking it down while others think he’s rejoining the team after a long absence as a federal agent. The Duffers have suggested Hopper is helping cover up the events of Season 1, and that seems to add more credence to this theory. \n8. The Upside Down is Hawkins’ future. \n// \nThe Upside Down seems to be a parallel universe version of Hawkins, but fans are still trying to figure out what it actually is . One suggestion: the Upside Down isn’t another dimensions, its Hawkins future. The supposition is that, somehow, Eleven tore a hole in the space-time continuum, allowing bits of a potential future to flow into Hawkins to create a time loop. The future she’s seeing? It’s Hawkins after the site has been nuked by the U.S. government to stop the giant creature from the teaser, and the Upside Down. That would explain why the Upside Down a mirror of Hawkins, but ruined, and constantly beset by falling ash. And the monsters are mutated creatures (or people) from the future they’re helping to create. This one has some holes, though. \n9. The Upside Down isn’t an evil dimension, it was attacked \nPossibly an even better theory to explain the Upside Down is that it’s an alternate dimension, but not a necessarily malignant one. The idea here is that the place looks like Hawkins because it’s just an alternate version of the town where people would otherwise live. The gross tentacles, the creatures, the slugs, and the toxic atmosphere are symptoms of an invasion from a third dimension. This invader destroys life, or even sucks the life out of dimensions. Its ability to cut through and attack other dimensions is why the Demogorgon finds its way into Hawkins. Eleven helped attract the invasion, but it’s still in the early stages of taking over Earth — until Season 2. \nRead original story 9 ‘Stranger Things’ Fan Theories About Season 2 At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.
