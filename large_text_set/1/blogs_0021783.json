Not only does the studio have to juggle the onslaught of live-action adaptations releasing this year like Justice League , but Warner Bros. has its animation team hard at work on comic book one-offs as well. Fans already know that a Harley Quinn and Batman film is being developed on that side, but it is the Teen Titans who fans should be looking towards now. The superhero squad is getting a new animated feature based off the popular Judas Contract comics, and the movie has just been given a rating. UP NEXT: Teen Titans: Judas Contract Movie Adds Christina Ricci and Miguel Ferrer as Terra and Deathstroke \nOver on Twitter, Stitch Kingdom was able to report the rating for Teen Titans: The Judas Contract . The film is said to be rated PG-13 due to some violence, suggestive material, and language. \nOf course, fans will understand why the film needs a higher rating and may even wonder why an R-rating was not awarded. After all, the comic book does heavily feature one of DC’s most violent villains Deathstroke. The Judas Contract reveals the character’s origins in the comics, and the Teen Titans have a none-too-gentle encounter with the cold blooded killer. \nMost importantly, the softer rating will more than likely prevent one of the comic's most controversial elements from appearing on-screen. In the source material, the Teen Titans storyline caushed an uproar because of its inclusion of an underage, sexual relationship between Deathstroke and Terra. \nYou can check out the synopsis for Teen Titans: The Judas Contract below: \n“Teen Titans: The Judas Contract will follow in the spring and will serve as something of a follow-up to last year’s Justice League vs. Teen Titans. “The Judas Contract” debuted in 1984 in the pages of New Teen Titans, when the Titans’ comic book popularity was at its height. Written by Wolfman and drawn by Perez, it introduced the perhaps not-to-be-trusted Terra to the Teen Titans and was the storyline in which Dick Grayson first adopted the identity of Nightwing. “The Judas Contract” was one of the most popular comic book storylines of its year and is continually ranked among the greatest Teen Titans stories ever told.” \n#TeenTitansTheJudasContract rated PG-13 for some violence, suggestive material and language — Stitch Kingdom (@stitchkingdom) January 24, 2017 \nThis DC Animated venture will not be the only released in 2017. Fans already know Justice League Dark will be getting much-wanted love from the studio when its standalone feature is released. And, so far, rumors have been swirling that a Nightwing project may be on the horizon. These features will all follow last year’s much-anticipated release of Batman: The Killing Joke , an R-rated movie that left both fans and critics split. \nTeen Titans: The Judas Contract is due out later in 2017. Up first for DC Animation is Justice League Dark . That film will be available from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Deluxe Giftset, Blu-ray Combo Pack and DVD on February 7, 2017, and on Digital HD starting January 24, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T04:30:49.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
