Negotiations have been ongoing for some time but with little visible progress. \nRobert Fernandez, however, insists there is no cause for concern and both players will extend. \n\"[Messi] will renew, as I've always said,\" he told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser . \"He is happy in Barcelona, he feels comfortable in the team and the environment is perfect. \n\"I don't have any doubt [that he'll sign a new deal]. Looking into his eyes I see that he is happy at Barcelona. \n\"I don't want to speak too much, though, as I know that there are many repercussions with this topic. \n\"[Iniesta] will also renew and he'll do it in his own time. I have no doubt that he'll renew and neither does he.\" \nVarious reports in Spain have suggested that if Messi does sign, it will be for a deal of around £35million-a-year, or £670,000-a-week.
