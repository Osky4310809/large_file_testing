Pinterest Buyable Pins : Get your products up on Pinterest. Buy Button : Generate an embed code that you can paste on any web page to sell anywhere. Messenger Channel : Allow customers to contact you for support, buy products, and receive order notifications through a Facebook Messenger chat. POS : Sell offline in a pop-up shop or at an event with a point-of-sale device. Amazon : List your products from Shopify on Amazon to sell in one of the biggest marketplaces online. Launch: Getting Backer Data From Kickstarter to Shopify \nOnce you've set up your store and have successfully completed your campaign, you'll need to get the order information from all your backers before you can go about shipping them their rewards. \nInstead of sending out a backer survey and going through the manual process of fulfilling all your orders, you can export your Backer Report from Kickstarter and use your email marketing solution to get backers to make their order through your online store. \nSource: Kickstarter \nOpen the .CSV file in Excel and calculate the total retail value of what each backer will need to order from your website‚Äîbased on their pledge level‚Äîand group the different amounts (e.g. you have 10 x $50 pledges, 3 x $55 pledges, etc.) If you offered early bird pricing or bundles, where your products were discounted, you might need to do some calculations to find the retail value. \nOnce you have this information and have sorted it into groups in your spreadsheet, you'll need to generate unique 1-time use codes for each backer, for the specific retail value of each pledge level. \nIf you haven't already, you'll need to install the free Bulk Discounts app in your Shopify store to do this. \nHere's Rockwell Razors on how they used the Bulk Discounts app to save them from a crowdfunding crisis : \n‚ÄúIn Rockwell's first Kickstarter campaign for the Rockwell 6S, manufacturing challenges due to a dishonest supplier negatively impacted the experience of many of our backers (you can listen to / read more about this in my Shopify Masters interview ). After redesigning the product and finding a new supplier, we re-launched the Rockwell 6S and offered a free replacement to every backer from the original Kickstarter campaign.\" \n\"In Rockwell's first Kickstarter campaign for the Rockwell 6S, manufacturing challenges due to a dishonest supplier negatively impacted the experience of many of our backers (you can listen to / read more about this in my Shopify Masters interview). After redesigning the product and finding a new supplier, we re-launched the Rockwell 6S and offered a free replacement to every backer from the original Kickstarter campaign.\" \n\"By using the Bulk Discounts and Mailchimp integration apps, we created and emailed unique discount codes to each of the 2500 backers that gave them 100% off their new-and-improved Rockwell 6S. Backers loved this, and hundreds of backers ordered additional (paid-for) razors to accompany their free replacement. We did $17,000 in sales in one day, which went a long way to subsidizing the cost of making and shipping all those free razors! While I hope readers of this article never have to replace 2500 items for their customers, Bulk Discounts can be used in other ways to reward your backers - think about backer-exclusive discounts on new products or offers for free samples with orders over $50!‚Äù \nIf the discount needs to apply to more than one product (rewards or bundles, for example), you can make it apply to an entire collection in the Discount Type fields. \nThe window to use the discount code should account for how long it'll take you to ship your products plus another 6 to 12 months to ensure your backers get a chance to claim their order. \nOnce you've used the discount code generator to make enough discount codes for the number of backers at a pledge level, you can export them and add them to a new column in your backer report spreadsheet (call it \"Discount Codes\"). \n\nOnce you‚Äôve assigned discount codes for all of your backers, save the .CSV file and import it as a list into your email marketing solution. \nCreate a campaign and, in the email builder, use merge tags to personalize the emails so each backer gets an email with their unique discount code, a link to your store, and instructions on how to claim their reward. As your backers order through your store, you will get notifications (you'll know from the cha-ching! sound) and be able to see them in the Orders section of your Shopify store. \nNote: If you have an existing inventory of products that you want to keep separate from your backer rewards, be sure to create a ‚ÄúBacker Rewards Collection‚Äù and don‚Äôt list it on your regular store. Be sure to provide direct links to this collection to your backers and explain to them it can only be accessed via this link. Shipping and Fulfillment: Getting Rewards to Your Backers \nWhen you‚Äôve finally got your backers to place their orders through your Shopify store, you can use Shopify Shipping to create and print shipping labels at discounted shipping rates. \n\nIf you haven‚Äôt already, make sure to set expectations as to how and when shipments will arrive in your FAQ section . \nIf your rewards are being dropshipped, let them know they might receive their order and rewards separately to reduce the risk of complaints and chargebacks. \nTo learn more about shipping and fulfillment, check out our guide: Shipping and Fulfillment 101 And Growth üöÄ \nRounding off your Kickstarter campaign and launching your store is only the beginning. \nThe rest is growth. \nYour Shopify store is built to scale with you‚Äîletting you add features, new channels‚Äîthe sky‚Äôs the limit. \nWe're in your corner all the way‚Äîwith free resources on the Shopify blog to help you grow and scale your business, as well as gurus on call to offer 24/7 customer support. \nSo, where will you take your business from here?
