Ighalo’s fear of missing out from the Super Eagles is heightened since the Manager has not called him just like he called John Obi Mikel when he moved to Tianjin Teda in January. \nIghalo lost his first-team place at Watford following a loss of form which saw him score just one Premier League goal this season. Odion Ighalo \nSpeaking of his last days at Watford, the 27-year-old revealed that he was frustrated with his bench role under new boss Walter Mazzarri who was appointed following the sacking of Enrique Sánchez Flores in the summer of 2016. \nThe striker also revealed that he preferred to stay in England or Europe but clubs did not meet Watford’s valuation of him. \nIghalo was a subject of interest from West Brom who pulled out of a move because of Watford’s asking price. \n“I think Watford want too much so I don’t think we’ll be on that one,” West Brom boss Tony Pulis said in late January. Changchun Yatai finally paid £22m for the striker making him the most expensive Nigerian player ever.
