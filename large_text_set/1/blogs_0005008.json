Stop mentioning how you miss him and then never actually planning a date. Look him dead in the eyes and tell him he’s taking you to the movies and picking you up at eight. To him, straightforward women are sexy women.\nTaurus : April 20th – May 20th Buy him a gift. Something small that shows him you’ve been paying attention. His favorite flavor of milkshake. A DVD of his favorite movie. A phone case in his favorite color. It’ll make him realize how lucky he is to have someone like you.\nGemini : May 21st – June 20th He’s going to be turned on by your talent, so use that to your advantage. If you play an instrument, invite him to a performance. If you write, send him your latest story. If you sing, bring him to a karaoke bar. Let him see you in action.\nCancer : June 21st – July 22nd Cancers love love. If he’s single, then he’s probably wishing he was in a relationship. That’s why you should tell him that he’d make a great boyfriend. That any girl would be lucky to have him. That you wish you had someone like him. Amp up his ego.\nLeo : July 23rd – August 22nd Leos want to feel attractive. That’s why you should compliment him on his physical appearance. Tell him how sexy his muscles are and how his eyes pop when he wears blue. Make it clear that you’re sexually attracted to him.\nVirgo : August 23rd – September 22nd Virgos are shy, so you have to make the first move. Just don’t do anything too extreme and scare him off. That means you shouldn’t invite him over to your apartment and walk him straight to your bedroom. Start by hanging out one-on-one at a coffee shop or a diner.\nLibra : September 23rd – October 22nd He’s active and loves the outdoors, which is why you should invite him on a run or at least a walk. While you stroll around the park, you can trade stories and get to know each other better. The more time you spend together, the faster he’ll realize you’re the girl for him.\nScorpio : October 23rd – November 21st Kiss him. I know, I know, it seems drastic. But it’ll get your point across. Scorpios aren’t interested in talking about feelings or defining relationships. They’re affected by actions more than words. So, if you want him, show him.\nSagittarius : November 22nd – December 21st He’s impatient, so you don’t want to wait too long to make your move. Invite him over to your place. Watch a movie with him. And if you’re not ready for a kiss, at least lean on his shoulder so he knows you’re interested in him.\nCapricorn : December 22nd – January 19th He’s independent, so don’t make him feel suffocated. When you ask him to hang out, act casual. When you text him, don’t send ten messages in a row. Give him room to breathe, so he doesn’t freak out and run off.\nAquarius : January 20th – February 18th Men like him enjoy grand, romantic gestures. So after you get to know him, write him a poem. Learn his favorite song on guitar. Serenade him through his window. Do something elaborate. Something so crazy that it appears genius.\nPisces : February 19th – March 20th Pisces are social, which means he probably has a lot of female friends. That’s why you have to make it clear that you’re not just being friendly — you’re being flirty. If you don’t make your feelings abundantly obvious, then he’s never going to get the hint. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T02:02:56.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
