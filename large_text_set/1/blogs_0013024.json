This white paper must be published by mid-February to give parliament and the devolved governments time to scrutinise it.” \nThe committee, which took evidence in Sunderland and Aberdeen as well as Westminster, includes prominent figures from the leave campaign, including former ministers Michael Gove and Dominic Raab. \nGove, who was the co-chair of Vote Leave, asked at one of the committee’s early hearings about the possibility of a “quickie divorce” from the EU. \nSome pro-Brexit MPs are sceptical about the need for a transitional deal, which they fear could unnecessarily prolong the process of leaving and make it harder for the UK to strike new trade deals with countries outside the EU.
