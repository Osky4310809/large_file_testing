That envelope, he said, \"said 'Emma Stone, La La Land .'\"\nSEE ALSO: Oscars shocker: 'La La Land' announced as Best Picture, but 'Moonlight' wins\nHis suggestion: Someone had mistakenly handed him the envelope for Stone's Best Actress win, which she'd accepted just moments before.\n\"WARREN, WHAT DID YOU DO?!?!\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/bBmalDLzCJ\n— Mashable (@mashable) February 27, 2017\nBut minutes later, Stone had a very different version of events. Speaking with reporters backstage, she lavished Moonlight with praise, then said:\n\"I also was holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time. So whatever story ... I don't mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card. So I'm not sure that happened. And I really wanted to talk to you guys first.\"\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Emma Stone just moments after her Best Actress win for \"La La Land.\"\nImage: Christopher Polk/Getty ImagesGetty Images\nThough this seems to be setting up a he-said, she-said for the ages, there is evidence to suggest that Beatty was truly not to blame.\nMoonlight writer/director Barry Jenkins, also speaking to reporters backstage, said the Academy had offered \"no explanation\" for the mishap.\n\"Things just happened,\" Jenkins said. \"I saw two cards? Things just happen, you know. I wanted to see the card, to really see the card, and Warren refused to show the card to anyone before he showed it to me.\"\nAbout that same time, Los Angeles Times reporter Amy Kaufman tweeted that a colleague, positioned just offstage, witnessed the moment when someone first realized there had been a mistake — and yes, it involved Beatty holding the wrong envelope:\nReport from @JeffreyLAT backstage: Mid @LaLaLand acceptance, stage hand in wings said \"Oh, f-ck. Oh my God. He got the wrong envelope.\"\n— Amy Kaufman (@AmyKinLA) February 27, 2017\nAnd a Chicago Sun-Times columnist, watching from home, captured this image:\nI was recording the #oscars to a hard drive.

Did he try to cover up his own blunder? Did Stone's envelope grow legs and leap into Beatty's hands?\nNo one knows exactly yet — and as reporters pressed Jenkins for details on the \"two envelopes\" theory, the Academy's media wrangler immediately shut those questions down.\nAnd that's when Jenkins summed it all up pretty well: \"The last 20 minutes of my life have been insane.\"\nUntil we find out how this happened, the next couple of days may not be any calmer — or less insane.\nBONUS: If 'La La Land' was directed by David Lynch, it'd look something like this...", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mashable/status/836083692221120512", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oscars?src=hash", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9s6_e6Wr6vDJIDLQVhJsPsaAKmo=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F396600%2Fc6e8cbeb-49c0-40d4-9ad5-3aef3f9ec279.jpg", "https://t.co/PL3eA8Ds1i", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/6sQtfKsM.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/6sQtfKsM.m3u8", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/A2Gl8ff7myVxq_jEh7Cxis6WZ4w=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F396600%2Fc6e8cbeb-49c0-40d4-9ad5-3aef3f9ec279.jpg", "https://t.co/bBmalDLzCJ", "https://twitter.com/Ihnatko/status/836091971773018113", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/oscars?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/AmyKinLA/status/836092879537745920", "https://twitter.com/JeffreyLAT", "https://twitter.com/LaLaLand"], "published": "2017-02-27T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:03:15.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
