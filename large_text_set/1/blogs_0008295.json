AP \nNEW YORK, United States — New York Knicks star Derrick Rose has been fined an unspecified amount and is back with the team following his mysterious no-show, the NBA franchise said on Tuesday. \nRose baffled team officials and fans after failing to appear for the Knicks’ 110-96 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans at Madison Square Garden on Monday. \n“Derrick Rose has rejoined the team and has been fined. He is expected to be in uniform tomorrow in Philadelphia,” the Knicks public relations department said on Twitter Tuesday.
