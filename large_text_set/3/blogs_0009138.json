Woman’ Celebrates Female Power March 8, 2017 10:31 AM Filed Under: A Day Without A Woman , City-County Building , International Women's Day , Jon Delano , Washington DC , Women's March \nPITTSBURGH (KDKA/AP) — Many American women stayed home from work, joined rallies or wore red Wednesday to demonstrate how vital they are to the U.S. economy, as International Women’s Day was observed with a multitude of events around the world. \nThe Day Without a Woman protest in the U.S. was put together by organizers of the vast women’s marches that drew more than 1 million Americans the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. \nThe turnout on the streets this time was much smaller in many places, with crowds often numbering in the hundreds. There were no immediate estimates of how many women heeded the call to skip work. \n“Trump is terrifying. His entire administration, they have no respect for women or our rights,” said 49-year-old Adina Ferber, who took a vacation day from her job at an art gallery to attend a demonstration in New York City. “They need to deal with us as an economic force.” \nThe U.S. event — inspired in part by the Day Without an Immigrant protest held last month — was part of the U.N.-designated International Women’s Day. \nLocally, Pa. Rep. Jake Wheatley gave all female employees in his Pittsburgh and Harrisburg offices the day off with pay. \n“Women make invaluable contributions in the workplace, yet they continue to lag behind their male peers in terms of pay and promotion,” Rep. Wheatley said. “Giving my female employees the day off is one way to add more voices to the growing chorus that’s demanding policy changes to help women achieve parity, in the workplace and elsewhere.” \nIn Troy Hill, Scratch F&B is also giving their female employees the day off with pay. \nAccording to our news partners at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the restaurant is bringing in male guest bartenders for a Half the Sky event. Proceeds from the event will be donated to Planned Parentood. \n“It’s just a really great show of community support,” says owner Don Mahaney. \nMahaney says he is giving his employees the day of with pay to show how important women are. \n“This is, for me, about showing how indispensable women are for us in the workforce…The statistics are carted out pretty often; women making 80 cents on the dollar, that we don’t really value or measure that women do domestically without pay. They’re indispensable to my work force,” he said. \nHundreds of protestors participated in a march in Downtown Pittsburgh Wednesday afternoon. They gathered at the City-County Building and the rally went on for more than two hours. \nAt one point, police blocked Grant Street so the protestors could march to the Federal Building and back. And the rally cut across all economic, age, gender and racial backgrounds. \n“I think it’s a shame that the United States is kind of late to the party on International Women’s Day, to be honest. So, it’s really nice that now we have mobilization within women’s ranks,” said Megan Lovett, of Stanton Heights. \nOne protestor even dressed up as a modern-day “Rosie the Riveter.” \nMeanwhile, internationally there were rallies and marches, too. In Warsaw, thousands of women showed Poland’s conservative government red cards and made noise with kitchenware to demand full birth control rights, respect and higher pay. \nIn Rome, hundreds of women marched from the Colosseum to demand equal rights. Thousands marched in Istanbul, despite restrictions on demonstrations imposed since last year’s failed coup. Turkish police did not interfere. \nWomen also held rallies in Tokyo and Madrid. \nGermany’s Lufthansa airline arranged for six all-female crews to fly into Berlin. Sweden’s women’s soccer team replaced the names on the backs of the players’ jerseys with tweets from Swedish women. Finland announced a new $160,000 International Gender Equality Prize. \nA crowd of about 1,000 people, the vast majority of them women, gathered on New York’s Fifth Avenue in the shadow of Trump Tower. Women wore red and waved signs reading “Nevertheless she persisted,””Misogyny out of the White House now” and “Resist like a girl.” Thirteen people were arrested for blocking traffic, police said. \nSchool in such places as Prince George’s County, Maryland; Alexandria, Virginia; and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, canceled classes after hundreds of teachers and other employees let it be known they would be out. In Providence, Rhode Island, the municipal court closed for lack of staff members. \nIn Washington, more than 20 Democratic female representatives walked out of the Capitol to address a cheering crowd of several hundred people. \nDressed in red, the lawmakers criticized efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood. \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi encouraged more women to go into politics, saying, “You have marched for progress. Now you must run for office.” \nA few hundred people gathered on the lawn outside Los Angeles City Hall to rally for women’s rights. Julie D’Angelo took the day off from her job in music licensing, saying she wanted to stand for those women who can’t afford time away from work or are too intimidated to ask for the day off. \nHundreds of women dressed in red and holding signs with photos of their local lawmakers gathered at the Utah Capitol to remind legislators they are closely watching how they handle women’s issues. \nIn Denver, several hundred people marched silently around the state Capitol. Kelly Warren brought her daughters, ages 3 and 12. \n“We wanted to represent every marginalized woman whose voice doesn’t count as much as a man’s,” said Warren, a sales associate in the male-dominated construction industry. \nSome businesses and institutions said they would either close or give female employees the day off. \nThe owners of the Grindcore House in Philadelphia closed their vegan coffee shop, where eight of the 10 employees are women. \n“The place definitely wouldn’t run without us,” said Whitney Sullivan, a 27-year-old barista who planned to attend a rally. \nIn New York, a statue of a fearless-looking girl was placed in front of Wall Street’s famous charging bull sculpture. The girl appeared to be staring down the animal. A plaque at her feet read: “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.” \nAs part of the Day Without a Woman protest, women were also urged to refrain from shopping. \nSome criticized the strike, warning that many women cannot afford to miss work or find child care. Organizers asked those unable to skip work to wear red in solidarity. \nMonique LaFonta Leone, a 33-year-old health care consultant in Colorado Springs, Colorado, had to work but put on a red shirt and donated to charity, including Planned Parenthood. \n“I have bills to pay, but I wanted to make my voice heard, no matter how quiet,” she said. “I also wanted to make a statement to say that women are doing it for themselves. We’re out here in the workforce and making a difference every day.” \nTrump took to Twitter to salute “the critical role of women” in the U.S. and around the world. He tweeted that he has “tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.” \nFirst lady Melania Trump marked the day by hosting a luncheon at the White House for about 50 women. \nThe White House said none of its female staff members skipped work in support of International Women’s Day. \nLovely Monkey Tattoo, a female-owned tattoo parlor in Whitmore Lake, Michigan, offered tattoos with messages like “Nevertheless, She Persisted” — a reference to the recent silencing of Sen. Elizabeth Warren on the Senate floor — with proceeds going to Planned Parenthood. \nWomen make up more than 47 percent of the U.S. workforce and are dominant among registered nurses, dental assistants, cashiers, accountants and pharmacists, according to the census. \nThey make up at least a third of physicians and surgeons, and the same with lawyers and judges. Women also account for 55 percent of all college students. \nAt the same time, American women earn 80 cents for every dollar a man makes. The median income for women was $40,742 in 2015, compared with $51,212 for men, according to census data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T05:49:35.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
