Tear gas canisters were also launched there, wrote Le Parisien.

The nominal trigger was the arrest and alleged brutalization of Theo Luhaka, a suspected criminal, during an arrest in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. The officers who detained him have since been suspended and face criminal charges. \nBut this has done little to defuse the tension, with “Justice for Theo” slogans gradually replaced with demonstrations “against state violence.” Previously, most of these flashpoints occurred around transport hubs, and on the streets at night, but the scope appears to be widening. \nIn a Saint-Denis school on Tuesday, teachers were forced to lock themselves up in classrooms, as students launched Molotov cocktails and set fire to bins. Although 55 people were arrested – 44 of them minors – copycat incidents have arisen throughout France, with daily arrests for public disorder and vandalism in the double figures. \n“We have reached a new level of violence,” Philippe Tournier, the general secretary of the head teachers’ union, said, noting that many of the rioters were disadvantaged, being poor and from ethnic minorities. “If things carry on this way it will be end up with someone dying. Ten years ago, we did not see scenes of this nature.” \nBoth the National Front of Marine Le Pen, and the center-right Les Republicains of Francois Fillon have condemned the violence, and promised to combat it, if their candidates are voted in after next month’s presidential election. But the incumbent Socialist government has accused the opposition of “fanning the flame” of the protests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T03:49:58.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
