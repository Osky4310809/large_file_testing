When he returned to the vessel after an outing with his sons, she had gone, along with her suitcase and her mobile phone, he claimed. \nMr Belling's lawyer, Luigi Conti, told the Sunday Independent yesterday that his client did not kill his wife. He said Ms Yinglei was a missing person and the international police agency Interpol was obliged to search for her. \n\"Now we want her as a missing person because we do not have the body of this person,\" he said. \nIn the meantime, Mr Belling languishes in a prison cell in Rome while their two young children are in the care of Italian social services. Efforts are being made to repatriate them. \nMr Belling, who is originally from Germany, made international headlines last Thursday when he was arrested at an Italian airport as he was about to board a plane home to Ireland after his wife vanished from the luxury cruise. \nThe couple, who live in Clare Hall in Dublin, had set off on an 11-day cruise with their two children aboard the MSC Magnifica. \nThe ship set sail from the Italian port of Civitavecchia on February 9 and continued on to Genoa, Malta, Greece and Cyprus. \nCrew members noticed Ms Yinglei was missing when they did a head count at the end of the cruise. \nThey alerted police, who arrested Mr Belling at Ciampino Airport in Rome as he was about to board a Ryanair flight with his children. \nMs Yinglei was registered on the Magnifica's passenger record on February 10, following a stop-over at Genoa, the day after the ship set sail. \nA souvenir shop owner later told reporters that she remembered the couple and their two children in her store that morning, when Mr Belling was \"agitated\" and \"yelled\" at his wife over her shoes. \n\"He said: 'Put these on instead of your sandals and shut up',\" she said, adding that he handed his wife a pair of gym shoes. \nHowever, according to local reports, Mr Belling told a magistrate during a prison court hearing last Friday that the family remained together until the ship reached Katakolon. \nMr Belling reportedly told the judge that they had quarrelled the night before and she wanted to \"quit the trip\". According reports in local Italian press, he claimed his wife left while he was on an outing with the boys. \nRead more: Murder accused ran 'Cinderella' wedding business with wife who disappeared from cruise \n\"I thought she was returning to Dublin. She was acting weird lately,\" he reportedly told the judge. \nMr Belling did not report his wife's disappearance to the ship's staff. However, his lawyer, Mr Conti, told the Sunday Independent that after she left, Mr Belling informed the cleaning personnel that three people were now staying in the room, not four. \n\"This comportment [is] not the comportment of a killer,\" he said. \nIf Mr Belling thought his wife may have returned to Dublin, there was no sign of her at the couple's apartment in Clare Hall in north Dublin yesterday. The mobile phone number she used for her wedding planning business went to voicemail with the message: \"Hi, this is Angie.\" \nMr Belling and Ms Yinglei, who also goes by the name Angie Li, have lived in the apartment block near the Clare Hall shopping centre for several years. Mr Belling worked as an IT consultant to firms such as Apple while Ms Yinglei set up her own wedding planning business targeted at the Chinese community in the city. Their two sons, aged six and four, were born here. \nLike many families, they fell on hard times during the recession. \nIn 2010, they both lost their jobs and they fell behind with their rent on their apartment in west Dublin and had been served with eviction notices. The landlord accused them of keeping two kittens against the rules and of subletting the flat. \nThey ended up in court, after Ms Yinglei returned from a trip to China to share wedding photos with her family and discovered that they had been evicted from their apartment. \nAccording to a court report of the case in 2011, Ms Yinglei was in the apartment when gardai were called. She refused to come to the door and a garda eventually broke it down. Ms Yinglei was prosecuted for burglary and criminal damage but the judge dismissed the charges. \nThe couple moved to Clare Hall and Ms Yinglei started her wedding business in 2015, offering unique designs with \"trendy and innovative touches and bespoke events\". \nThe website featured numerous podcasts, some in Chinese, and one from \"Daniel and Angie\" at the Bloom Festival. \nAccording to Mr Conti, the couple had parted company on holidays before. On one occasion, Ms Yinglei returned to Dublin. \"Another time the wife go for six months in China. This is the type of relationship in this family,\" he said. \nMr Belling remained in Regina Coeli prison in Rome this weekend. He appeared before a magistrate in the prison's court last Friday. \nHe has been formally charged and remanded in custody pending an investigation. \nMr Conti said his client \"will respond to all questions, he wants to speakâ€¦ he wants to make a declaration.\" Sunday Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T20:20:25.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
