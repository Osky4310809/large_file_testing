Contributor, Arc. Politics, national security, and occasional nerdery. 4 mins ago Thought Trump’s First Week Was Bad? What Happens After a Terrorist Attack? Protests outside JFK airport in New York Without an precipitating event, President Trump announced a ban on travel from 7 predominantly Muslim countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. His executive order also suspended refugee admissions from all countries for at least 120 days, and from Syria indefinitely, after which the United States will give preference to Christians and religious minorities over Muslims. Security detained hundreds of people in US airports, including green card holders, foreign exchange students, approved refugees who spent years trying to get away from ISIS and, in an especially egregious example, an Iraqi who risked his life helping American forces as a translator. The purported reason is protecting Americans from terrorism, but this policy won’t do that. It will, however, be a boon to jihadist recruitment, playing directly into their propaganda. That’s why the ban is such a bad idea. It’s both immoral and terrible strategy. It’s cruel and will make Americans less safe. But if this is what the Trump administration does now, what will happen after the next terrorist attack? President Trump, signing the executive order The Ban Doesn’t Even Make Sense on its Own Terms America faces a serious threat. Jihadists have committed themselves to making war on the United States, and some sacrifice is defensible in the name of security. But smart strategy relies on facts, not exaggeration. The number of Americans killed in 21st century terrorist attacks committed by individuals from the seven banned countries is zero. That’s not a typo. It’s not a small number, it’s not a negligible percentage. It’s zero. In justifying the ban, Trump cited the September 11th attacks, which were carried out by people from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon and the UAE. Notable post-9/11 jihadist terrorism on US soil includes: Fort Hood (2009): 13 killed by Nidal Malik Hassan, who was born in Virginia. His parents were Palestinian-Americans who immigrated from the West Bank. Boston Marathon (2013): 3 killed, 280 injured by brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan was born in Russia and had permanent resident status in the United States, Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan and became a US citizen in 2012. San Bernardino (2015): 14 killed by married couple Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. Farook was born in Illinois; his parents were from Pakistan. Malik was born in Pakistan, grew up in Saudi Arabia, and came to the US in 2013 on a K-1 fiance visa. No refugees. No one from the banned countries. Not that it matters. “Why these countries and not those countries?” is the wrong line of argument. It implies the problem with the ban is the target, rather than the whole idea. Banning people from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, Russia or anywhere else would also hurt America economically, damage diplomatic relations, and aid jihadist recruitment in exchange for, at best, a microscopic reduction in the risk of attack. Refugees Aren’t Dangerous There are surely some Americans who support keeping Muslims out for the sake of keeping Muslims out. But many believe refugees, especially from Syria, pose an unacceptable security risk. They’re wrong. Studying all terrorist attacks on US soil from 1975–2015, the Cato Institute’s Alex Nowrasteh determined that the chance of an American being killed by a refugee terrorist is 1 in 3.6 billion per year. The chance of being killed in a terrorist attack perpetrated by an asylum seeker is a similarly minuscule 1 in 2.7 billion per year. For comparison, the chance of being struck by lightning is about 1 in 960,000 per year. And the chance of an American being murdered by a fellow citizen is about 1 in 22,000 per year. Refugee status is the hardest way to get into the United States. Tourist, business, and student visas are all easier to get. Even illegal immigration is easier. Applicants have to go through interview after interview, by both international and American agencies. The screenings aren’t perfect, but they’re very good. Because the United States takes so few refugees — decently less than 1% of those that apply— if any interviewer thinks something might be wrong, they just reject and move on to the next applicant. To believe that refugees are dangerous, you have to believe that ISIS operatives are so incredibly smart that they can fool interviewer after interviewer, but so incredibly stupid that they pick the single hardest way of getting into America. Scared People Do Stupid Things Trump announced the ban on Holocaust Remembrance Day, an especially jarring irony that reminded Americans their country turned away thousands of Jews fleeing the Nazis. The official reason? They might be working for Germany, and letting them in would threaten American security. smithsonian.com In the summer of 1942, the SS Drottningholm set sail carrying hundreds of desperate Jewish refugees, en… www.smithsonianmag.com No Jewish refugee in the United States was ever convicted of spying for the Nazis. A single case — not a refugee, but a naturalized American citizen who returned to Germany in 1938 and then got caught trying to sneak back into America in 1942—drove public fears. Nazi Germany was an existential threat, but al Qaeda and ISIS aren’t. They present a serious danger, but they can’t invade D.C. and overthrow the government. However, they might be able to manipulate America into self-defeating actions. Seeing Trump’s first week, they must be thrilled. By blocking everyone from multiple countries, and giving preference to Christian refugees over Muslims, Trump feeds into jihadist propaganda that America is leading a civilizational war against Islam. Very few Muslims believe that. But the more that do, the fewer will work with the United States, and the more will be willing to fight with al Qaeda or ISIS. Terrorists and insurgents lose many fighters in battle, and jihadist groups rely on suicide bombers. Recruits are their lifeblood. And self-starters — individuals, such as the San Bernardino attackers, who are not members of a terrorist group, but launch attacks on their own in support — are especially difficult to stop. Trump inspired more self-starters, and aided terrorist recruitment, in exchange for a travel and refugee ban that, at best, does virtually nothing to increase security. At worst, it’s just xenophobic, anti-Muslim bigotry. After the Boston Marathon bombing There will be another terrorist attack. When, where, and how big we don’t know. But at least something on the scale of San Bernardino will sneak through. Will the president follow Bush and Obama, project calm, unite Americans, defend innocent Muslims, and insist the conflict is between humanity and a few evildoers, rather than the West and Islam? Or will he exaggerate the danger, divide the country, and conflate the terrorists with all Muslims? Millions of Americans reacted to Trump’s executive order with horror. Protesters flocked to airports, demanding the release of people caught by the ban mid-flight. A federal judge issued a stay, ruling that they should not be sent back to their home countries. Those who support the ban mostly kept quiet. But in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, with the president stoking fears instead of calming them, the public reaction will be different. Banning Muslims from entering — or rounding up those already here — wouldn’t make us safer. But with a new attack dominating the news, millions of Americans might feel like it would. Get ready. This will get worse before it gets better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-29T16:42:21.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
