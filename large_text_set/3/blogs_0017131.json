The two young men are immigrants, having recently moved to the United States from Central America.\nThe young girl informed police that Jose Montano, 17, and Henry Sanchez, 18, took her into a bathroom stall and raped her, Daily Mail reports. \nBecause Sanchez has a pending \"alien removal\" case against him, officials are presently working to deport the youth, the Washington Post reports.\nPolice suspect the 18-year-old illegally entered the United States from Guatemala seven months ago. \nBecause Montano is a minor, Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not release information on his immigration status. However, it is known that he arrived from El Salvador some eight months ago.\n\nMontgomery County Assistant States Attorney Rebecca MacVittie deemed Sanchez a \"substantial flight risk\" and was not granted bond in court on Mar. 17.\n\"I believe that you are a danger,\" District Judge Eugene Wolfe informed Sanchez.\nThe alleged attack took place on Mar. 16 at Rockville High School, Montgomery County Police stated. The arrests took place the following day.\nThe female victim was approached at around 9 am in a school hallway by the two teens, officials said.\nMontano asked the girl for sex but was rejected by the freshman, a police press statement reveals. \nThe young man insisted, then used force to get her into a stall inside the boys' bathroom, where he and Sanchez subsequently raped her.\nThey assaulted her as the two allegedly took turns holding her down. She resisted and managed to run away from the pair. \nThe victim later informed school officials of the alleged sexual assault.\nOfficials working for the Special Victims Division arrested the two suspects on high school grounds on charges of first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense. \nMontano will be tried as an adult, despite police not releasing his booking photo. \nThe two teens were attending classes at the high school as ninth graders, despite their age. \nAccording to WUSA, on Mar. 17, Rockville High School distributed a letter regarding the incident and subsequent arrests to parents.\n\"Ensuring a safe, secure and welcoming learning environment for all of our students is our top priority. Our staff remains vigilant in the monitoring of our school each and every day,\" a segment of the letter stated.\nMontgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala said the school will heighten monitoring of bathrooms and hallways in response to the assault.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T17:53:38.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
