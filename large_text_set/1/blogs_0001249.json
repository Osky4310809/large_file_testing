The ending of 7B is very different than the beginning of 7A,\" Gimple said. \"Just the vibe in 7B, I was just talking about it with Andy [Lincoln] last night. It's just a very, very different half season than the half season that preceded it. Even with structure, what we're doing right now with the episodes and seeing where everyone is at, the structure is very, very different than the back half.

You see a man in action again with some of the members of his closest family.” \n\"There’s a lot more levity, if you can believe that, than you’ve ever seen before in Mr. Grimes,\" Lincoln said. \"There’s sort of a freedom in him, a feeling that comes from losing everything, and also the thrill of the fight. It’s the thrill of the fight again. He’s back in. All I’m saying is that the band is back together.\" \nNot only is the band back together but Rick will be meeting the Kingdom and King Ezekiel when the AMC series returns. It's the beginning of Rick's rallying of Alexandria, the Hilltop, and the Kingdom to take on Negan and the Saviors -- something fans have been eager to see since Glenn and Abraham lost their heads. \n\"There are several episodes that I loved being involved in and it certainly feels very much more like a show that I knew and recognized in the back eight,” Lincoln said. “I loved the episodes that I was in.\" MORE WALKING DEAD:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T20:55:06.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
