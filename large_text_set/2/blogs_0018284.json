So a difference in interest of a quarter of a percent or half a percent or one percent makes a huge difference over the life of the mortgage.\" \nStart by checking your credit score and ordering a full credit report. Bera recommends going to AnnualCreditReport.com , where you can order one free credit report from each of the three federal credit bureaus annually. To keep tabs on your credit score throughout the year, she recommends monitoring free sites such as Credit Karma and Credit Sesame . \nOnce you know where you stand in terms of credit, you can get an idea of how good of an interest rate you'd be able to qualify for on a mortgage. If your credit score sits at 700 or higher, you're probably in good shape to get the best interest rates out there, Bera says. But if it hangs below that, work on paying down debt and taking care of any old debts that might have ended up in collections. \nAt the end of the day, buying a house isn't solely about having enough money. Getting your financial house in order plays a huge role as well. \nNOW WATCH: These are the best and worst places to retire in the US \nSee Also:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:56:29.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
