What is a 'Collateralized Debt Obligation - CDO' \nA structured financial product that pools together cash flow-generating assets and repackages this asset pool into discrete tranches that can be sold to investors. A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is so-called because the pooled assets – such as mortgages , bonds and loans – are essentially debt obligations that serve as collateral for the CDO. The tranches in a CDO vary substantially in their risk profile . The senior tranches are relatively safer because they have first priority on the collateral in the event of default . As a result, the senior tranches of a CDO generally have a higher credit rating and offer lower coupon rates than the junior tranches, which offer higher coupon rates to compensate for their higher default risk . BREAKING DOWN 'Collateralized Debt Obligation - CDO' \nAs many as five parties are involved in constructing CDOs: Securities firms, who approve the selection of collateral, structure the notes into tranches and sell them to investors; CDO managers, who select the collateral and often manage the CDO portfolios; Rating agencies, who assess the CDOs and assign them credit ratings; Financial guarantors , who promise to reimburse investors for any losses on the CDO tranches in exchange for premium payments; and Investors such as pension funds and hedge funds. \nThe earliest CDOs were constructed by Drexel Burnham Lambert – the home of former “junk bond king” Michael Milken – in 1987 by assembling portfolios of junk bonds issued by different companies. Securities firms subsequently launched CDOs for a number of other assets with predictable income streams, such as automobile loans, student loans, credit card receivables and even aircraft leases . However, CDOs remained a niche product until 2003-04, when the U.S. housing boom led the parties involved in CDO issuance to turn their attention to non-prime mortgage-backed securities as a new source of collateral for CDOs. CDOs subsequently exploded in popularity, with CDO sales rising almost 10-fold from $30 billion in 2003 to $225 billion in 2006. But their subsequent implosion, triggered by the U.S. housing correction, saw CDOs become one of the worst-performing instruments in the broad market meltdown of 2007-09. The bursting of the CDO bubble inflicted losses running into hundreds of billions on some of the biggest financial institutions , resulting in them either going bankrupt or being bailed out through government intervention, and contributing to escalation of the global financial crisis during this period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-01T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-01T12:14:27.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
