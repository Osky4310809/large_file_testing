Giphy \nTotal Croatia News reports the men used the derogatory term “crncuga,” which means the N-word in Croatian. After verbally abusing both Jamie Foxx and the restaurant staff, the police were alerted at around 10 pm. \nRestaurant staff worked to remove the men from the restaurant just before law enforcement responded swiftly by arresting the 44-year-old and 50-year-old. \nWhile the racist “drunk” diners are currently being investigated, the report states the men will likely be charged with disturbing the peace. Here’s the moment Jamie Foxx was targetted with racial slurs while dining at a restaurant in Croatia.

Giphy \nThis isn’t the first time this year Jamie Foxx has been involved in restaurant chaos. According to TMZ, the 49-year-old actor had recently been dining at popular Los Angeles hotspot Catch when he was violently attacked . \nFoxx had been chatting with a group of associates when a man confronted the group for being “too loud.” That’s when things got heated and the attacker said, “You don’t want to mess with me. I’m from New York.” \nSomeone at Foxx’s table allegedly fired back, saying, “Fuck you. I’m from Oakland.” It was at that point the man “lunged” at the actor, forcing Foxx to secure him in a chokehold and take him down. \nLook, I don’t know what fellow diners have against Jamie Foxx, but someone needs to get Chris Crocker on the phone so we can cue up this #LeaveJamieAlone campaign.
