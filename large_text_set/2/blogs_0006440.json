He put a speed bump,” Huckabee said Tuesday on Fox News’s The First 100 Days . “And he did that to protect the rest of us. And I think a lot of Americans are saying, ‘Thank God he did it.'” Advertisement - story continues below Huckabee: Don’t Blame Russians, Blame ‘Dumb Democrats’ \nHuckabee told host Martha MacCallum that there’s a “good likelihood” the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will rule against the president’s temporary travel ban from seven Middle Eastern countries, which would send the case to the Supreme Court. \nA federal district judge in Seattle put a nationwide hold on Trump’s travel ban on Friday, prompting the Trump administration to appeal to the 9th Circuit to reverse the decision. The three judges from the 9th Circuit are expected to issue a decision on the matter by the end of this week. \nHuckabee doesn’t hold the 9th Circuit in high regard, saying that it’s “notoriously left-wing and biased.” Advertisement - story continues below \n“I don’t think they’re going to give Donald Trump a fair shake,” Huckabee continued. \nHuckabee believes that the courts are overstepping their bounds by legislating from the bench. “The court really has no business getting into the policy issue,” he said. “It’s not about whether they like it, it’s about whether the president has the legal authority.” \nHe then criticized how the courts treated the Obama administration versus the Trump administration. \n“Throughout the Obama administration, [the courts] consistently made sure the president had the authority to make such decisions. For them to suddenly say, ‘oh new president, new law’– can’t do that,” Huckabee argued.
