ADVERTISEMENT \n“We thought they will ask for water but soon, as one of them got on our boat, they showed their firearms. The other men also boarded our boat and started hitting our colleagues,” Sakandal said. \nKevin Banahan, another survivor, said he even spoke with the men in Tausug, the dialect of the people of Sulu. \nWhen things started turning ugly, he said he and several other companions— \nincluding Sakandal—jumped off the fishing boat. Their eight other companions were seized by then, including Bagalanong and his 16-year-old son, Richard. \nSakandal and Banahan said they heard bursts of gunfire while they were swimming for safety. \n“We just swam until we saw some islands and other fishing boats,” Banahan said. \nIt was about dawn when they reached Barangay Sangali, where they immediately went to the village hall to report the incident to village chair Daud Bakil. \nAuthorities who proceeded to the site of the incident saw eight corpses. \nThe hands of the victims were tied with nylon ropes behind their backs and their bodies riddled with bullets, according to Chief Insp. Chester Natividad, commander of the Sangali police station. \nNatividad said among those slain were two minors. \nMayor Maria Isabelle Climaco Salazar said she had ordered a thorough investigation of the incident as authorities announced the arrest of a possible suspect. \nNatividad identified the suspect as Midzfar Yunos Nuno, 32, a resident of Sitio Seaside in Sangali, who was arrested Tuesday evening. \nHe said Nuno had been arrested in the past for extortion among fishermen in the village.— JULIE ALIPALA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-12T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-12T03:09:46.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
