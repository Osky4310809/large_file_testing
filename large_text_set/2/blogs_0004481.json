It was a constant in their clashes that he genuinely didn’t like. \n“I never just woke up and went, ‘I wanna do this to Anthony Mundine, I’m sick of this bloke, I’m sick of that’. I’m just answering questions,” Green told FOX Sports News 500’s Cody Kaye post-fight (watch above) . \n‘ROBBED: MUNDINE’S REACTION TO GREEN DEFEAT’ \n“I’m a pretty peaceful guy unless you fire me up. I’m pretty mellow. You fire me up and you want to do something to me or my family, then I’m not peaceful at all. \n“I won’t miss that part of it [the rivalry], because it’s never been about me and him as far as ... unfortunately there’s been so much about race and religion. That’s your [Mundine’s] choice. \n“Like I said, the other day about the anthem, if he wants to - that’s his prerogative and that’s his opinion and that’s his choice. That’s his choice. He can do that. Unless it harms me or my family or my community, if it starts harming them, well then, I’ll take a stand. But I can’t tell people what to do.” 'Nothing to do with colour' 0:55 \nBoxing: Winner Danny Green has praised his opponent Anthony Mundine and made it very clear the result of the fight had nothing to do with colour. February 4th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/More Sports/ 'Nothing to do with colour' \nGreen made a point of the issue in the ring post-fight, declaring: “I want to say to Australia - this has nothing to do with black or white, this is a fight, it is sport. \n“That is nothing to do with colour. I won the fight against another man. That’s it.” \nMundine has been an outspoken voice on Aboriginal rights issues and is also a devout Muslim. His views on both matters have always been forthright and often controversial, with Green put in the position where he was forced to react, in his role as Mundine’s arch-rival. Choc reflects on tough loss 5:25 \nBoxing: Anthony Mundine talks to Cody Kaye after his devastating loss to Danny Green. February 4th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/More Sports/ Choc reflects on tough loss \nHowever, Green said he had always respected Mundine as an athlete and made that clear to his great rival after the fight, as they came face-to-face one last time in the ring. Green also expressed his deep regard for Indigenous Australians. \n“I’ve always had respect for Choc as a fighter, mate,” Green said. “As an athlete. \n“Without him, my career wouldn’t have been possibly as fulfilling in a couple of big fights. But after the first loss with Choc, I went a different way and on my own path. \n“I didn’t say much, mate [in the ring]. I just said, ‘Thanks for a great fight. Me and you have been great for each other’s career. It’s been a wild ride. I’ve got a lot of respect for you and I’ve got a truckload of respect for your people’. And he said, ‘I know that, mate - likewise’.” Choc, Green show of respect 0:26 \nBoxing: Anthony Mundine and Danny Green hug it out prior to their 10th round at Adelaide Oval February 4th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/More Sports/ Choc, Green show of respect \nGreen said he felt comfortable retiring because such an immense win could never be topped. Yet he reflected on how close he came to losing it all just 55 seconds into the fight, when he was struck with a Mundine foul punch while looking at the intervening referee. \n“Literally the first minute in the first round ... the referee was going to stop it,” Green said. \n“And I was like, ‘Man, this can’t be happening, this is a nightmare. And I dug my way back and I come good, I said, ‘Nah mate, I’m good’. But I was cooked. I was completely knackered. \n“It was a very, very debilitating shot. It really stung early and it was clearly a foul. I think the referee should have given me time to recover too, he didn’t give me any time. It was really hard. \n“I think by the end of the first round [I got my legs back], because I’m obviously in decent condition, you’re able to recover. It would have stopped a lot of people. I was able to hang tough and continue.” media_camera Danny Green speaks to Anthony Mundine post-fight. Picture: Mark Brake \nGreen also reflected on the immense battle to get his ageing body ready for the fight. \n“I’ve been through a hell of a lot physically just to get to the fight. Back, elbow, hand, nose. It was very, very hard,” he said. \n“My back, I had a lot of stuff done on my back. Three epidural cortisones before I even left to come to training camp in eight weeks’ time. It was really, really bad.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:26:29.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
