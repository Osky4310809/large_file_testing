He added, “There was a point there, Lester, where it felt as if he almost was insulting every living President that was sitting next to him — in very personal ways.” \nHis colleague Tom Brokaw added, “He was also insulting all the republican Congressmen and Senators who were on that stage. He has a majority. But he went after politicans point blank.” \n[ featured image via screengrab ] \nFollow Joe DePaolo (@ joe_depaolo ) on Twitter \nHave a tip we should know?
