That amounted to a 71 percent drop from 2016’s All-Star weekend in Toronto, Canada, where the cheapest available ticket the Friday before the game went for $644. \nTickets for the other events of the weekend, such as the slam dunk and three-point shooting contests, were also selling for much less than last year, going for as little as $157, compared to $362 in 2016. \nOverall, ticket prices were roughly down by half, averaging about $1,007 per ticket while tickets for the 2016 event averaged more than $2,000. Advertisement – story continues below \nForbes noted that prior to this year, the cheapest any All-Star game tickets sold for two days before the big event was in Orlando in 2012, where seats could be grabbed for as little as $250. The cheapest tickets for 2015’s game in New York went for $686, while the 2013 game in Houston topped the charts at $962. \nNew Orleans last hosted the All-Star game in 2014, and this year would be the third time the city has hosted the event since 2008. It was expected that the draw of the big game would be an economic boon to the city, equaling or exceeding the extra $106 million in revenue gained in 2014, but that seems unlikely now. \nWhile it is possible that ticket sales and prices are down because of a backlash against the NBA’s overt political interference in the affairs of a state, it is also possible that residents of New Orleans have grown tired of hosting the game so often, particularly given the small market share, poor performance, dwindling attendance and internal ownership issues that have plagued the New Orleans Pelicans for the past season or two.
