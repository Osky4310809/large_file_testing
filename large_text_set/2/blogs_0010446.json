The project encompasses a large-scale mural in New York City, spanning 2,500 square feet. Launching with artwork from San Francisco-based illustrator Jayde Fish, the wall will also be home to a variety of other collaborations as the year progresses.\nAdditionally, in celebration of the wall, a Snapchat filter created by Fish will be available in the vicinity of the artwork.\nThe wall will officially launch February 7 at Lafayette Street, between Prince and Spring. Collaborations will be ongoing until March 31; be sure to check it out if you’re in the NYC area.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:13:58.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
