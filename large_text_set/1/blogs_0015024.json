It would break my heart into a million pieces to see Molly act this way when she's older,\" she wrote. \"I would never want her to even think this was an option, never mind actually throwing herself at a man like that.\" PHOTOS: Celebrity Babies 2016 \nBut the former Bachelorette still sympathizes with Olympios — and wishes she could share some advice with the season 21 standout. \n\"Corinne's tears really struck a chord with me,\" wrote Fedotowsky, who handed out her final rose to now-ex Roberto Martinez back in 2010. \"She reminded me of a girl that had just slept with a guy and woke up the next morning hating herself. I've been there. I know many women have. I truly hope Corinne realizes that she can attract a man with so much more than her sexuality.\" Corinne and Nick Viall on The Bachelor.

But because she's mentally immature.\" \nTell Us : Do you agree with Fedotowsky? \nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. \nCan't get enough of Us ?
