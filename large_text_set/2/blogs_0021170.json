REX/Shutterstock \nBANG, BANG!!! \nAccording to Elle, Watson’s dress is designed by Emilia Wickstead, and it’s made from sustainable fabrics. Who knew Cinderella was an eco-warrior? REX/Shutterstock \nIt’s somewhat ironic Emma Watson dressed like Cinderella for the “Beauty and the Beast” London premiere because she reportedly turned down the opportunity to play Cinderella in a different live-action remake. \nSpeaking on her decision, Watson said, \nI didn’t know they were going to make ‘Beauty and the Beast’ at the time I turned down ‘Cinderella.’ \nBut when they offered me Belle, I just felt the character resonated with me so much more than Cinderella did. She remains curious, compassionate and open-minded. And that’s the kind of woman I would want to embody as a role model, given the choice. \nUh, good call, Emma! Although, it’s hard to argue Emma Watson wouldn’t have been one awesome Cinderella, right? REX/Shutterstock \nSpeaking on her role as Belle and her relationship with the film, the 26-year-old actress said, \nThe other beautiful thing about the love story is that they form a friendship first. There is this genuine sharing, and the love builds out of that, which in many ways is more meaningful than a lot of love stories, where it was love at first sight. They are having no illusions about who the other one is. \nThey have seen the worst of one another, and they also bring out the best. \nWhat’s so beautiful about this story as a whole is this idea that Belle is able to see past these extraneous, external, superficial qualities of Beast. She is able to see deeper, and that’s one of her special powers. \nIt is her superpower: empathy.
