He was asked about his journey, from Brooklyn to Columbia, S.C., about the Gamecocks next opponent, about playing so well in a huge upset of Duke, about the opportunity to now play at the Garden. \nAnd the former Lincoln High School star kept repeating a variation of the same sentence. \n“I still feel like I’m dreaming. I never thought I would be in this position,” Felder said Sunday night after scoring 15 points off the bench to help No. 7 South Carolina stun second-seeded Duke to book a trip to Madison Square Garden and the East Regional semifinals this week. \nIt was one of his best performances of the season, but it wasn’t an anomaly. Felder, a 5-foot-10 freshman backup point guard, has averaged 5.7 points in 14.2 minutes per game, earning the trust of South Carolina coach Frank Martin, who never thought twice about playing Felder big minutes on Sunday. Duke was pressuring the ball, and Martin needed as many ball-handlers as possible. \n“We’ve won games because he comes in there and he’s aggressive and he’s fearless of the moment,” Martin said. “He loves the big stage.”\n“He has the heart of a giant. He doesn’t care who we’re playing,” teammate Sindarious Thornwell added. “He won’t back down from nobody.” \nFelder bounced around in high school, spending his freshman year in South Carolina, returning to New York the following year, attending Lincoln and The Patrick School (N.J.) the next three years. \nMartin joked Felder was the easiest recruitment of his career. After the first phone call last spring, he was ready to commit, and he signed in May. But in October, Felder nearly threw it all away. He was arrested on six charges, including third-degree assault and resisting arrest, following an altercation at a bar that left a person unconscious. Following a suspension, and after applying for pretrial intervention on the misdemeanor charges, he was given a second chance. \n“My journey has been like a roller coaster,” Felder said. \nWith family in the South Carolina area, he always wanted to be a Gamecock. But growing up, he imagined himself playing football there. He never did get back onto the gridiron after moving back to New York City for his sophomore year of high school, though. When Martin first called him, Felder thought it was a prank call. \n“Is this a joke?” he recalled saying. “South Carolina is my dream school.” \nIt’s not hyperbole to say Felder is living out a dream, contributing significantly for his self-described dream school in its first trip to the Sweet 16. And on top of that, he now gets to come back home, and play at the Garden. A year ago at this time, Lincoln lost the city championship game at the Garden, partly because Felder was injured and couldn’t play. \n“I’m blessed to be in this position right now,” he said. “It’s just crazy.” \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T07:41:58.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
