I need you all to go!” one officer can be heard shouting, imploring pedestrians to flee and take cover. \nOne passersby in the video can be heard asking, “Is it a terrorist attack?” adding that she had heard gunshots ring out nearby. \n“Go, just go! Clear the area! Stay under cover!” the officer further implored, as motorists were redirected away from the scene. \nAt least one knife attacker assaulted a police officer outside Westminster after a car violently struck several pedestrians before slamming into the gate at Westminster. \n“You lot, get under cover now!” the officer shouts, calling on all bystanders to flee the scene immediately. \nVia RT .
