By: Rajeev Kumar | Updated: March 14, 2017 1:42 PM Digvijaya Singh is Goa in-charge of Congress party. (ANI) \nGoa power tussle is now almost over with the Supreme Court paving the way for floor test by Manohar Parrikar-led BJP and its allies in the state’s Legislative Assembly on Thursday. The controversy on the issue, however, has once again exposed the Congress ’ inability to act fast and swiftly when it matters the most. This is also one of the reasons why Congress’ political stock is declining across the country. \nTiming is important in all aspects of life, even in politics. And Congress has failed miserably in checking its sense of time. The grand old party botched up its entire campaign in Uttar Pradesh by first going all alone and then joining the Samajwadi Party just before the start of the polls. Had it fought alone, the Congress would have ended with better returns in the end. As far as Goa is considered, the party has once again botched up its chances of forming the government in the state and made a mockery of itself by moving the Supreme Court. Here are at least five reasons: \nHorse trading charge doesn’t sound convincing \nThe Congress has alleged that BJP is indulging in horse trading for getting the numbers in Assembly. However, the allegation doesn’t sound convincing. First, BJP has received support from independent political parties and independent candidates, not the Congress MLAs or its allies. The Congress fought the polls alone and it can’t now cry foul claiming BJP has bought the MLAs. All parties are free to join a camp which can serve their purpose well. \nSecondly, politicians prefer to ally with the party that is on the rise. Congress is already a dying force unless it sets its house in order. \nInternal bickering among Goa Congress leaders didn’t let the party chose a CM candidate early \nThe Congress leaders of the state were fighting among themselves before they could lay claim to government formation. The BJP moved fast, arranged the numbers and approached the governor. The Congress, in a way, was beaten in its own politics \nParrikar factor \nCongress didn’t have any leader as popular as Manohar Parrikar, who left the Defence Ministry for ruling Goa once again. It was natural for other parties, except Congress, to rally around Parrikar after he gave his consent to move to Goa. Prior to elections, it was a was a predominant belief among experts and voters in the state that the BJP would get a majority if Parrikar fought as the saffron party’s CM candidate. \nDigvijay Singh’s failure \nDigvijay Singh is turning out to be a liability for Congress. His regular controversial statements not only keep denting Congress’ image, but he also keeps failing in making fool-proof strategies for the Congress. While Singh, who is Congress’ Goa in-charge, moved slowly for government formation, BJP’s NitinGadkarir acted with urgency and came up with an unbeatable strategy. #WATCH : Rahul Gandhi says, “We are in opposition,you have ups & downs, we had a little down in UP, its fine we accept that” #ElectionResults pic.twitter.com/6kj43gXzA1 \n— ANI (@ANI_news) March 14, 2017 \nGovernor’s discretion The Governor has the discretion to invite the largest party, or group of parties, to form the government if they manage to prove majority on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. With the open support of 21 MLAs to BJP in the 40-member Goa Assembly, the governor was correct in inviting it for government formation. This was acknowledged even by the Supreme Court today.
