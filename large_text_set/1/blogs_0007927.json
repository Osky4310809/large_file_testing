The exact amount of proposed financial compensation for the plaintiffs has not been published by the news agency. \nOver 100,000 Herero and Hama are estimated to have been killed between 1904 and 1908 during the uprising against German colonial rule in South-West Africa as the territory was called at the time. The unrest was started by the Herero who were joined by the Hama tribe a year later. The rebellion was viciously suppressed by German troops. After facing massive resistance from both tribes, German commander Lothar von Trotha called on his soldiers ‚Äúto shoot every Herero with or without weapon within the German [colonial] borders.‚Äù @eddiesurfs Herero and Nama protesters, raising the issue of the Kaisers Genocide at the U.N in #NYC #Herero #Blacklivesmatter #Namibia üíÄ pic.twitter.com/vZLsSIWahy ‚Äî Eddie Briggs (@eddiesurfs) September 21, 2016 \nThose who survived, were later placed into the concentration camps, viewed by some historians as a prototype for the similar facilities to exterminate the Jewish population by the Nazi Germany during the Word War Two.

While Germany has long resisted using the term when referring to the colonial period, the government issued a guideline referring to the slaughter in Namibia as ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in July last year. \nHowever, there‚Äôs still no definitive resolution by the German parliament which officially recognizes the slaughter as a genocide, as is the case of the mass killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire which preceded the Turkish nation. \nSince 2012, Germany and Namibia have been engaged in intense dialogue to hammer out an agreement for an official apology from Berlin and a potential financial settlement from Germany. The initial plan was to reach consensus by the end of 2016, however, negotiations are still underway. \nLate December, German chief representative at the talks with Namibia,Ruprecht Polenz, stressed that acknowledging the slaughter as genocide does not automatically put an obligation on Berlin for reparation payments. \n‚ÄúAccording to the view of the [German] Federal Government, the use of the term 'genocide' does not imply any legal obligation, but rather political and moral obligations to heal the wounds,‚Äù Polenz told Deutsche Welle (DW). \n‚Äú[It implies] no legal obligation on reparations. We stand with this view,‚Äù he stressed. \nIn November last year, Namibia‚Äôs Vice Land Minister lashed out at the German position. ‚ÄúIt shows that black lives are worth nothing,‚Äù Bernadus Swartbooi told DW. However, Germany has not officially rejected any potential payments to Namibia, with reports saying such an option is still on the table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T06:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T02:25:11.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
