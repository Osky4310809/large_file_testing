It shall inculcate patriotism and nationalism, and encourage their involvement in public and civic affairs,” Abu added. \nIf passed into law, those who finished their college and ROTC courses will have the equivalent of first level civil service eligibility and an incentive for second level eligibility if the student pursues Advance ROTC.
