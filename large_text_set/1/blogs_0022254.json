Hint: it’s a little bit spooky. The number “93” puzzled Glamour writer Christopher Rosa, who wondered if it was the star’s birth year. Nope, Yung Smurf (as she calls herself in her Instagram bio) was born in ’97. (Yeah…that makes some of us feel slightly elderly.)\nTattooer to the stars and king of the tiny understated design , JonBoy, inked the little number on the outer forearm of the statuesque, blue-haired beauty. In his Instagram post, she is seen rocking a hole-y Johnny Cash t-shirt, paying homage to another rebel who’s gone before. Her tie-dye button-down shirt perfectly matches her fading blue hair.\n93 @bellathorne #jonboytattoo \nA photo posted by c/s ∴jon✞boy∴ p/v (@jonboytattoo) on Jan 23, 2017 at 8:35pm PST \nShe stares at the camera with eyes that contain the secrets to the Universe.

It’s a religion founded by occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904. Isopsephy is a practice of adding up the numbers that correspond to the letters in a word to form a single number. 93 adds up to Thelema. The Law of Thelema centers around two phrases: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law” and, “Love is the law, love under will.”\nOoooh . Is that sounding a little heavy or spooky to you? Then look at this cute little heart tattoo that Bella got before this one. \nHappy gal:) it's almost the weekend!!! #hellyeah ✨ ⚡️ #thursdaythoughts \nA photo posted by BELLA (@bellathorne) on Dec 1, 2016 at 12:15pm PST \nWhatever Bella’s “93” actually means, she sure knows how to pull off a tiny, mysterious tat!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:48:29.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
