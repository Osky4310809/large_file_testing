I want a swimsuit that is as loud and vivacious as me. Sheridan: Considering the fact that my boobs are so saggy, I could technically hackeysack with them, I’m always looking for a suit that can support them but also be stylish. We want support! And we want style! \nJazzmyne: Finding plus-size swimwear that is ACTUALLY cute is so hard! If you do go to a store, theres a chance you will run into the infamous “tropical/Hawaiian” swimsuit with matching skirt, which at age 26 is not what I want to wear. \nKristin: Every swimsuit seems to assume that once a clothing item is a “bathing suit,” it no longer requires any of the support a bra provides. It’s like, “Well, whatever, you’re going into water anyway, might as well flatten your boobs into a pair of constantly escaping pancakes.”\nID: 10347609 4.

I absolutely love the color and it has great little design details that make it more than a basic high-waisted bikini. I feel supported and I feel stylish, and I cannot wait to rock this at the beach, at the pool and anywhere else I can!\nID: 10347956 View this image › \nBuzzFeed ID: 10355938 Macey J.

My boobs feel like they’re being cradled by angels, and the buckles on the bottoms are so freakin’ badass. Now excuse me while I go drink a martini and slay ‘em.\nID: 10347965 View this image › \nBuzzFeed ID: 10355948 Macey J. Foronda / BuzzFeed\nMacey J.

I have been letting myself live my life in two-piece swimsuits within the past year, so I was worried I wasn’t going to feel sexy in a one piece, BUT DAMN I DID. I did not want to take it off because it was so comfortable and just felt like it was meant for me!\nID: 10347981 14. In the end, all of us were definitely feeling this line.
