A rough year means the company will not only miss profit expectations, but will have to buy out a thousand employees and end its DL line of compact cameras. \nThe company described the costs of the restructuring (announced in November) as an “extraordinary loss” — meaning abnormal, not eye-popping, though it is both. The writedowns total nearly ¥30 billion, or around $264 million.
