ABC Justin Timberlake may not have won the Academy Award for Best Original Song last night, but that doesn’t mean he left the bizarre awards show on Sunday as a loser. That title went to whoever was in charge of making envelopes for the presenters to read from. \nEach year the nominees in the Best Original Song category get a chance to perform their song live from the ceremony. With Timberlake being the outstanding showman that he is, the singer took the opportunity to make the case for why he deserved to win with a fantastic performance of “Can’t Stop The Feeling” from the animated film Trolls in front of La La Land's elite. \nAs seen in the video below, JT starts things out in the lobby before heading into the theater while leading a team of backup dancers in that “Suit & Tie” of his like some kind of boy band pied piper. After taking the stage for a flashy song and dance, he continued into covering Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day,” which had the entire audience up on their feet and clapping their hands. Even Sting and Jackie Chan were enjoying it, so you know it must have been a damn good time. \" By: Tom Shackleford AXS Contributor Feb 27, 2017 Added 45 minutes ago Sponsor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:39:08.457+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
