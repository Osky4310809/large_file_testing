Women’s March yesterday, former Obama adviser and CNN contributor Van Jones said that when he saw Obama fly away, he felt that hope and what the Left had built was dying. That feeling no felt that way after seeing what happened in the nation’s capital yesterday and all over the country. Around three million women marched against Trump. Yet, Jones also had some words for conservatives, which is that we need to be better (via CNN ): Van Jones: \"We love the conservatives enough to tell them that they have to be better conservatives than this.\" https://t.co/NuRq4QWHXc — NBC News (@NBCNews) January 21, 2017 We love the conservatives enough to tell them that they have to be better conservatives than this. You have to be better conservatives than this. Real conservatives love the Constitution. We have a president who seems to be an authoritarian. Real conservatives stand up for and believe in clean government. We have a president who seems to be committed to a kleptocracy. \nSay what you will; I’ll just leave this here. But I doubt that the Right is going to listen to this call to arms to be better (whatever that means) from a social justice warrior. Also, we all know the Left hates conservatives, so there's a misfire right off the bat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T01:01:29.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
