Staff writers, FOX SPORTS January 28, 2017 7:17pm HOW did Adam Taggart or Trent Bahgiar not open the scoring? With Central Coast Mariners and Perth Glory’s level in a heated match at Gosford, the Socceroo missed a golden chance to put his team ahead. Glory striker Andy Keogh played a pinpoint cross to Diego Castro at the far post. The Spaniard cutback fell perfectly for Taggart to stab the ball into an open goal, but somehow he missed. “That’s one of the worst misses I’ve seen since I’ve been back in the country,” said Fox Sports football expert Mark Bosnich at half time. “I think he’s just taken his eye off it.” media_camera Taggart fails to score. Bosnich said any sun in Taggart’s eyes played no part in the error and the ball didn’t bobble off the ground as the Glory player attempted to kick it. However a replay showed the ball bobble over Taggart’s foot. Fox Sports commentator Robbie Slater explained he should have got his body behind the ball so he didn’t miss the chance. But moments into the second half, Trent Bahgiar missed a great chance to give his side the lead. From kick off the Mariners broke through the Glory defence and an open Bahgiar was crossed the ball in the centre. He slammed his shot towards goal but it bounced off the post and was cleared away from danger.
