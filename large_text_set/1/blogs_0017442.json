Intelligence means that you do not make the same mistake twice.” \nArsene Wenger’s post-match summary of Granit Xhaka’s sending off against Swansea back in October clearly hasn’t resonated with the £30million summer signing from Borussia Monchengladbach. The ill-disciplined midfielder once again put his team in trouble when he lunged at Steven Defour in the second half of Arsenal’s last-gasp victory against Burnley at Emirates Stadium. It was a red card - ironically - issued by the same referee who gave Xhaka his marching orders against the Swans. Jon Moss clearly knows what the Swiss international’s game is all about and it’s fair to say that the biggest weakness in his game is proving costly for an Arsenal side who have been renowned for lacking discipline in key moments throughout the past decade of Wenger’s reign at the club. \nArsenal fans revel in Panenka penalty \nXhaka now has more red cards than any player in the top five European leagues (5) and it is his style of tackling which is becoming problematic for the Gunners. The 23-year-old is still a relatively young player who is learning with each game but the vast experience he picked up in the Bundesliga and being named as Gladbach’s youngest ever captain should have instilled a level of maturity into his style of play by now. Ultimately, it is up to the player to learn from his mistakes and Wenger is right when he says ‘intellligence means that you do not make the same mistake twice’. 5 - Since the start of last season, Granit Xhaka has had more red cards than any other player in the big 5 Euro leagues. Reckless. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) January 22, 2017 \nWenger signed Xhaka with the intension of blooding him as the future of Arsenal’s central midfield. He has consistently been unable to clarify where his best position on the pitch lies, although recently made an admission that Xhaka is more accustomed to defending than attacking. If that is the case then he can no longer be partnered with an attacking midfielder like Aaron Ramsey who prefers to roam and play much of his game as a box-to-box midfielder. \nAlexis sends Arsenal second \n“The noises I get that it was a red card. He has to control his game”, said Wenger after the game. The Frenchman was visibility annoyed at the fact that his summer signing still hasn’t learnt his lesson and even admitted his own frustration at being sent off himself in the final few minutes at the Emirates. \nIt was the talismanic Alexis Sanchez who once again saved the day for Arsenal in a late flurry of which emphasised the lack of discipline on show in north London. Andre Gray scored a penalty in stoppage time which looked to have secured them a surprise point before Koscielny was upended in the box after a high boot from Ben Mee. Replays later showed Koscielny in an offside position and Burnley will feel rightly aggrieved with the decision that took the two points away from them.
