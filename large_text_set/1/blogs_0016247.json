Now if wearing the tricolour is not your idea of showing off that patriotic spirit, we understand. Just that dash of #Indialove is what you need to look glamourously desi and we show you how. Take a look at these awesome Republic Day outfits and tell us which one you are going to try this January 26. \nThe Urban Desi \nFor the girl with a super chic wardrobe and a super desi heart, this lovely blue and white kurti with colourful tie-dye print palazzos is a great way to make a flamboyant style statement. The matching jhumkis and kada complete this look nicely. You might want to trade in the heels for a pair of jootis though. \nShop for palazzo suits . \nThe Modern Patriot \nIf you’re watching the fashion gurus these days, you’ll know that cotton sarees are so haute! And so is thread jewellery! Team them up and you have a winning Republic Day outfit. The neutral colours of this saree are the perfect base to show off hints of the tricolour. Add a bright orange bindi to get your patriotic style on point! \nShop for elegant sarees . \nThe Ethnic Fashionista \nCan’t get enough of your comfy salwar suits? Up the glam factor this Republic Day with a pair of multi-layer danglers and a chic jute gold clutch. Whether a fancy brunch with the fam or an evening do with friends, this cream and orange suit is sure to make you look fashionably patriotic! \nShop trendy salwar suits . \nThe Indian Hippie \nIf ethnic isn’t your go-to style, stick with what you love and rock it desi style! We recommend this white asymmetric tunic sans the leggings. Wear it as a dress and throw on a pop colour stole for effect. Sling on this embellished bag and wear a pair of comfy sandals to tie this look together nicely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T13:04:07.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
