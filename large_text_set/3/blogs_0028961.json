Could   \nIt looks as though they'll miss out on the top prize again, but it has certainly been another very good Premier League season for Tottenham Hotspur . \nMauricio Pochettino's men sit second behind Chelsea, but one of their players is very much No. 1 when it comes to a variety of categories over the season. \nStep forward Mousa Dembele, who has been putting plenty of other Premier League midfielders to shame. Sorry N'Golo, you aren't winning this one (Photo: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images) \nYep, even that one up there. \nThe Belgian has been so brilliant that he leads the standings in THREE of the most important metrics when it comes to midfielders. \nData courtesy of EA SPORTS shows that Dembele has completed the most dribbles in the division, with his rate of 61 completed from 71 attempted placing him way above some players who are considered to be more attacking in nature. Dribble completion rate - Premier League 2016/17 (percent) \nAs well as dribbling, the former Fulham man has also shown that he is pass-master too. \nGoing into Saturday's trip to Burnley, he's completed a staggering 998 of the 1092 passes he's attempted this season, giving him the best completion rate in the division. Pass completion rate - Premier League 2016/17 (percent) \nAnd not only that, when it comes to passes in the opposition half - keeping his side on the front foot - he's the best at that too. \nDembele's rate of 92% places him way ahead of his closest competitors - Arsenal's Granit Xhaka and Chelsea's N'Golo Kante. Pass completion rate in the opposition half - Premier League 2016/17 (percent) \nAll of which adds up to one very impressive performer, and surely someone who would be in contention for Player of the Year if Chelsea weren't running away with the title? \nData Courtesy of EA SPORTS, the Lead Partner of the Premier League.
