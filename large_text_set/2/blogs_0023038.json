The viewership advantage over his NBC rival was the largest since Colbert’s premiere week back in September 2015.\nThe president’s antics have more Americans engaging not just in news but also in news with a comical slant, said Needham entertainment analyst Laura Martin.\n“There’s so much drama in politics these days that it’s become a form of entertainment,” Martin said.\nColbert’s ratings ascendancy is caused by the same phenomenon that is helping “Saturday Night Live” draw more eyeballs, Martin said.\nWhile Fallon still draws more viewers in the coveted demographic of viewers ages 18 to 49, Colbert is narrowing his deficit.\nSEE ALSO \nColbert beating Fallon in ratings since Trump took office 0:0 President Trump’s promise to change America is already producing results... Over the last three weeks, Fallon’s ratings point advantage in the demo has slipped from 0.19 to 0.17 to 0.13, according to Nielsen.\nThe demo battle is key for the CBS bottom line.\nAdvertisers will pay up if Colbert is able to wrest the crown from Fallon.\nMartin said for CBS to capitalize on a revitalized “Late Show,” Colbert would have to maintain or add to his viewership lead until the up-front market for renegotiating advertising rates begins in May. Those negotiations generally conclude in July for the new TV season starting in September.\nWinning the demo ratings race would allow CBS to jack up its advertising rates — which, ironically, would mean that the No. 1 target of Colbert’s jokes would be the No. 1 reason the “Late show” would become more profitable.\nLast week, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves was already claiming “a great story in late night.”\nThe late-night time slot, which stretches from 11:35 to 1:35 and includes “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” is “delivering 10 percent growth in advertising revenue in 2016 and continued growth here in 2017,” Moonves said on a conference call last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:05:51.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
