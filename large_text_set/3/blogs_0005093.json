Most of the times we agree, but it's the approach.\" \nWhen Trump turned his remarks to the planned repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, Williams felt compelled to interject. \n\"Eight years â€” where's the plan?\" Williams asked, referencing the fact that Trump and his party have provided little specifics as to what a Republican replacement for the health care law might entail. \n\"Action is not a choice. It's a necessity,\" Hooper responded. \nRelated: GOP Draft Health Care Bill Cuts Medicaid, Insurance Subsidies \nBut the two noted the hardship that increasing premiums and high deductibles are having on working families across racial lines in Montgomery. The poverty rate in Montgomery County stood at 22.5 percent, according to a report by the nonprofit Alabama Promise . \nWilliams and Hooper expressed hope that the federal government's potential allocation of Medicaid funding through a block grant would effectively allow the state to expand coverage. (Alabama's Republican-led government did not choose to expand Medicaid under the ACA .) \nAnother thing the two agreed on: Trump's moderated tone. He began his remarks with an acknowledgement of the date, marking the end of Black History Month. \n\"We are reminded of our nation's path for civil rights and the work that still needs to be done,\" Trump said. \n\"It was visionary, substantive speech,\" Hooper commented after Trump concluded. \"He addressed the issues.\" \nAsked by NBC News what Trump can do to encourage Americans to come together, as he called for in his speech, Hooper responded: \"He's got to do these things that are going to create jobs, addresses inner cities, poor folks, [and make] affordable healthcare. Donald Trump is not scared. He went to churches in Detroit. A lot of Republicans wouldn't do that.\" \nHooper turned to Williams. \n\"I hope and pray that when he runs for re-election, that you'll be able to say, 'I changed my mind,\" Hooper said. \nAt one pointed, Williams pointed out that Republicans did not embrace the compromise Trump encouraged during Barack Obama's presidency. The Republican-controlled Congress under the former president could have implemented many of the same policies put forth by Trump on Tuesday night, including infrastructure investments, Williams said. \n\"President Obama would have done the same if Republicans hadn't obstructed him,\" he said, after Hooper praised the president's proclamations. \nHooper acknowledged Williams' point, but urged both parties to let bygones be bygones on that score. \n\"Congressmen and senators have to find a way to agree,\" he insisted. \"Now they may have to compromise on this and that, but people are mad at all politicians. They're mad at Republicans and Democrats. They're mad at obstructionists of the last eight years. They want something to get done.\" \nWilliams, who said that Trump used \"racist\" language during his campaign, called what he heard Tuesday \"a start.\" \n\"I'm prepared to give him room to evolve,\" he said. \nPerry jumped in: \"He's going to have to keep doing it.\" \n\"And it's got to be real,\" Williams said. \n\"[Trump] has to recognize that campaign was extremely, hurtful, threatening and frightening for a lot of people,\" he added.
