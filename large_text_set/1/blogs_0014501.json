However, the new season of CSL will almost reach the halfway stage in June. \n\"We can’t wait so long.” Costa rejoined the other players on Tuesday after days of training alone (Photo: Chelsea FC via Getty) \nThough Costa is now available for a recall against Hull on Sunday, the league leaders may decide to off-load the Brazil-born 28-year-old in the summer — when potential replacements also include Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez. \nChelsea are tracking his contract stand-off and will move for the Chile international - set to have just a year left on his current deal come the summer - if he makes it clear he does not intend to sign a new pact with the Gunners. Chelsea are waiting for signs from Sanchez to try to make this more than a mock-up (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nThe West Londoners' interest in Lukaku last summer was rejected by Everton but they have also yet to tie the Belgium international — who is keen on a return to Chelsea, his first English club — down to a new deal. \nLukaku, still just 23, has scored 18 goals in 25 appearances for club and country this season. His agent, Mino Raiola, has refused to rule out a summer exit, even if he signs a new contract before then. \nReal Madrid's Alvaro Morata, a striker Chelsea made unsuccessful bids for in the last window, is also on the Stamford Bridge short-list.
