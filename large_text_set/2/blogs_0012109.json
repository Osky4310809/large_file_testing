The chocolate will become unusable. [2] If you do happen to introduce a bit of water into the chocolate while melting, a little bit of vegetable oil will make the chocolate more usable, but it may still be grainy. /images/thumb/5/5a/Melt-Chocolate-Step-1-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-1-preview-Version-3.jpg /a/a2/Melt Chocolate Step 1 Version 3.360p.mp4 2 Add the chocolate to top of a double boiler . If you don't have a double boiler, you can easily place a light, non-plastic bowl set over a pot of lightly steaming water. The steam will slowly heat the chocolate above. /images/thumb/6/6d/Melt-Chocolate-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/6/6d/Melt-Chocolate-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg/300px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-2-preview-Version-3.jpg /b/bb/Melt Chocolate Step 2 Version 3.360p.mp4 Make sure not to let the bottom of the bowl (holding the chocolate) have contact with the steaming or boiling water. Contact with the water may cause the bowl to grow too warm, burning the chocolate instead of melting it. The chocolate will melt faster if it is broken up into smaller pieces. 3 Stirring constantly, move the chocolate around until it begins to melt. Because chocolate is very easily burned, be careful not to leave the room or stop stirring for too long. /images/thumb/4/48/Melt-Chocolate-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-3-preview-Version-3.jpg /1/1f/Melt Chocolate Step 3 Version 3.360p.mp4 4 Continue stirring until the chocolate has fully melted. Adjust the heat on the stove if you believe the chocolate is melting too quickly. The whole process should take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. /images/thumb/4/45/Melt-Chocolate-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-4-preview-Version-3.jpg /9/94/Melt Chocolate Step 4 Version 3.360p.mp4 5 Use the chocolate for dipping, dressing, or incorporating into another recipe. /images/thumb/8/88/Melt-Chocolate-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-5-preview-Version-3.jpg /8/85/Melt Chocolate Step 5 Version 3.360p.mp4 Method Melt with a Microwave 1 Measure out how much chocolate you want to melt. Break up the chocolate into smaller pieces with a knife if needed. /images/thumb/5/59/Melt-Chocolate-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-6-preview-Version-3.jpg /f/f0/Melt Chocolate Step 6 Version 3.360p.mp4 2 Place the desired amount of chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl. Place the bowl into the microwave. /images/thumb/d/d7/Melt-Chocolate-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-7-preview-Version-3.jpg /0/00/Melt Chocolate Step 7 Version 3.360p.mp4 3 Microwave on the lowest heat setting for approximately 30 to 40 seconds. Be sure to change your power setting to the lowest you can before nuking the chocolate. /images/thumb/c/cd/Melt-Chocolate-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/c/cd/Melt-Chocolate-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg/300px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-8-preview-Version-3.jpg /5/58/Melt Chocolate Step 8 Version 3.360p.mp4 If you are using small chocolate chips, the cooking time on the initial blast will be much lower than 30 seconds. Go in intervals of 10 to 15 seconds initially to make sure that the chocolate chips won't burn. 4 Stir the melted chocolate with a wooden spoon and reintroduce into the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds. Continue to microwave the chocolate on its lowest setting. /images/thumb/c/ca/Melt-Chocolate-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-9-preview-Version-3.jpg /2/27/Melt Chocolate Step 9 Version 3.360p.mp4 5 Stir and repeat microwaving in 10 second bursts until the chocolate is fully melted. /images/thumb/c/c9/Melt-Chocolate-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/550px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg /images/thumb/c/c9/Melt-Chocolate-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/300px-Melt-Chocolate-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg /b/b1/Melt Chocolate Step 10 Version 3.360p.mp4 A less expensive chocolate might be better suited for your first try at microwaving, in case it's accidentally scorched. Burning a less expensive chocolate is a lot easier on the psyche (and the wallet) than a more expensive one.
