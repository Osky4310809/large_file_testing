Courtesy of a leaked spec sheet, we find that the device will reportedly be even bigger than the Note 7, boasting a 6.2-inch curved screen. For reference, that is roughly the size of a phone book.\nDubbed the S8+, the phone is of course a variation of the S8, as it will also feature an iris scanner and headphone jack, and come packaged with “Earphones tuned by AKG.”\nFor now, you can get a look at the leaked spec sheet for the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8+, which is expected to be officially revealed in the near future.\nSamsung Galaxy S8+ spec sheet.
