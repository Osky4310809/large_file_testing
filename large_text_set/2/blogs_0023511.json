Photo by Sid Hastings \nCLAYTON • A deadlock over improvements to a south St. Louis County park has become a showdown pitting a new member of the County Council against a top administration staffer. \nThe standoff emerged Wednesday when St. Louis County Parks Director Gary Bess announced plans to circumvent South County Republican Ernie Trakas by beginning upgrades to Cliff Cave County Park without the approval of Trakas, or the council as a whole. \nBess said the $4.3 million construction of a paved bicycle path, parking lot modifications and other enhancements to the 525-acre Mississippi River frontage could begin as early as next week. \nThe project is being funded by grants from Great Rivers Greenway . \n“If this doesn’t move forward then the message we’re sending to Great Rivers Greenway is, we like their money but we’re finding ways not to spend it,” Bess said. \nTrakas vehemently disputes Bess’s contention that the county charter grants the administration permission to bypass the council on county projects. \n“This shows not only hubris but a general disdain for the council as well as any oversight at all,” the councilman said. \nThe Cliff Cave Park debate marks the second clash this year between County Executive Steve Stenger and his staff and a council newcomer. \nStenger and Democrat Rochelle Walton Gray of north St. Louis County have tangled for two months over the fate of the former Jamestown Mall. \nIn response, Gray has sponsored a bill that calls for the establishment of a position to advise the council on legislative matters. \nThe legislative research director would give the council the option of countering legal opinions of the county counselor, an office within the administrative branch of county government. \nTrakas said the action by the administration on Wednesday pointed to the need for the new post. \nCliff Cave Park “could be a litmus test to test the limits of the county counselor,” Trakas said. “I do not believe it is appropriate to go around the council on this. [The administration] seems to think they don’t have to ask. Maybe they’re right. We’ll see.” \nStenger maintains the issue was never about the division of power in county government. The county executive instead says “pure courtesy” prompted his office to seek Trakas’s approval. \nStenger said an easement to lay pipes and plumbing for a restroom on the parkland was the sole item Trakas and the council had the power to legislate. Instead, Stenger charges that Trakas held up a project with widespread public support by seeking concessions on the parking lot and park access. \nAs the deadline to accept the Great Rivers Greenway money neared, Stenger said his office had little choice but to move on a project that included $1.7 million in county funds in addition to the $4.5 million grant. \n“I couldn’t let $6.2 million go down the toilet because a councilman wouldn’t approve a toilet,” the county executive said. \nCiting concerns over traffic, safety and park access, Trakas has stalled the Cliff Cave Park project since taking office in January. The councilman said he is responding to issues raised by South County residents. \nBess says a survey of nearby households found just 32 percent opposed a park improvement plan that has been in the works since early 2016. \nA handful of South County residents voiced support for the upgrades at Tuesday’s council meeting. \nTrakas promised that Stenger and Bess have not heard the last from him on the matter. \n“I am going to talk to fellow council members to see how they want to proceed,” he said. “We’ll see if the council has the stomach” to challenge the administration on its decision to proceed with the changes to Cliff Cave Park.
