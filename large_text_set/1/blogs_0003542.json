I'm very pleased and proud of the effort, which was exceptional. We have to praise Arsenal for the way they came back. \nWenger slams fixture schedule despite Arsenal comeback \n\"The players in the dressing room should be congratulating each other, but the reality is that is not the case. When it settles though, we should look at a point against a very good side.\" \nHowe did lament the dismissal of Francis, who saw red for a challenge on Aaron Ramsey with eight minutes of regulation time remaining. \nReferee Michael Oliver showed no hesitation as he sent off Francis for an over-the-top tackle, much to the frustration of Howe. \nPochettino: Alli is the most important emergence in English football in years \nHowe added: \"It didn't help. \n\"I personally didn't think it was a red card, it was a committed tackle and probably a foul, but I don't think he lifted his studs in a dangerous way. \n\"We can't ignore their quality though and our players gave absolutely everything.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T03:15:17.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
