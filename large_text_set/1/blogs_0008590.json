That’s probably good news for sterling. May did talk about Brexit in an interview with Sky yesterday and, as a result, the pound as slumped. The same thing happened after she delivered a speech on leaving the EU at the Conservative party conference in October. Who’d have thought she would become a one-woman devaluation machine? \nMy colleague Graeme Wearden has more on what is happening to sterling here, on his business live blog. Pound hit by Brexit fears as FTSE 100 touches fresh record high – business live Read more \nInstead, May’s speech will be focusing on her vision of a “shared society” and on mental health. I will be covering it in detail. \nHealth will be big news today. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he would be making a statement on the NHS in the Commons this afternoon and in the Times (paywall) Mike Adamson , chief executive of the British Red Cross, has an article defending his decision to describe what is happening in the NHS as a “humanitarian crisis”. He says he did not use the term lightly. \nIn considering making this statement, I went back and looked closely at the definition of a humanitarian crisis: it refers to the scale and depth of need facing a population. \nIn this case we are seeing large numbers of vulnerable people facing a threat to their health, safety or well-being. At the most extreme end this has led to deaths; in a broader way it has led to prolonged physical and mental distress. \nBut there is an additional way of looking at this. I’ve been asked repeatedly whether it’s proportionate to use a term associated with Syria, Yemen and the Lake Chad region of west Africa about the NHS . Of course each of those crises is different. But to the British Red Cross, every crisis is personal. From famine to floods to loneliness, it’s not just the scale of the crisis that matters. It’s that the person affected feels they are in crisis. That person suffering on the trolley in a corridor feels at crisis point. The people our volunteers help feel scared and desperate. They feel they are in crisis. \nI’d expect May to respond in her speech, or in questions afterwards. \nHere is the agenda for the day. \n11.15am: Theresa May delivers her speech. \n3.30pm: Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is due to give a statement to MPs on the NHS. \n4pm: Louise Casey gives evidence to the Commons communities committee about her integration report. \nAs usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. \nYou can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. \nIf you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. \nI try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time.
