(Source: PTI) \nThis year’s assembly elections have been a fascinating story so far. BJP got a clear majority in one state but announced its CM face in three other states before that. While Trivendra Singh Rawat took charge as Uttarakhand Chief Minister, former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikart also won a vote of trust in Goa and now in what could be the final frontier, the party is set to go through a floor test in Manipur on Monday morning. The part is leaving no stone unturned to form the government in the state and has lodged all its legislators in a Guwahati hotel along with an Independent and a Trinamool Congress lawmaker since Thursday. \nREAD | Uttar Pradesh swearing-in Live updates: Ministers start arriving for Yogi Adityanath’s oath-taking ceremony in Lucknow \nIt is being said this step was taken to make sure these MLAs are not poached by Congress to hurt BJP’s chances. However, the party has denied any such act by saying there are not scared of Congress. “There is nothing like fear of poaching by the Congress before the floor test. We are here just to relax and also meet some of our senior party leaders,” BJP lawmaker Thokchom Radheshyam Singh told The Sunday Express. \nHe looked confident of Chief Minister N Biren Singh win in the floor test who has formed the first BJP-led government in the state. “While we are all returning to Imphal on Sunday to take the oath and then take part in the floor test, we are more than confident that our chief minister will sail through smoothly,” added Thokchom Radheshyam. \nYou may also want to watch: \nAnother BJP leader said that he won’t be surprised if the party gets the support of a larger number of legislators. “There is every possibility of cross-voting by quite a number of Congress MLAs,” he said. According to the Indian Express, 17 MLAs have been lodged in a hotel under tight security where a number of meetings will be held with party leaders like Himanta Biswa Sarma and Ajay Jamwal. Himanta Biswa Sarma played an important role in BJP’s win in Manipur also hosted a dinner with legislators on Saturday. “It was largely because of his (Sarma)’s strategy and support that we could oust the Congress despite having no MLA in the previous House,” said another BJP MLA.
