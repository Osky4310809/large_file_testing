McCaskill , tweet , U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) in June 2015 file photo (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \nST. LOUIS (KMOX ) – Missouri Republicans are shouting that U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill “has been caught in a lie” but her office says she just muddled a tweet. \nIt has to do with the Jeff Sessions-Russia controversy, which eventually forced him to promise to recuse himself from any investigations involving the presidential campaign (get live updates on the situation from CBS News >> ). \nMcCaskill was quick to tweet Thursday morning that she’s never met with the Russian ambassador. I've been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years.No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign Rel Com. \n— Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017 \nBut four years ago, in January 2013, she tweeted “off to meeting w/ Russian ambassador.” \nMcCaskill says it was about adoptions and there were several other senators there, too. 4 years ago went to meeting of many Senators about international adoptions. Russian Amb also attended. \n— Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017 \nAnd in August 2015, she tweeted about phone calls with the British, Russian and German Ambassadors in regard to the Iran deal. Again, As senior member of Armed Serv, never received call or request from Russian Amb for meeting. Never met one on one w/him. \n— Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) March 2, 2017 \nThe senator tried to walk that back. \n“I was thinking of a one-on-one meeting like he had,” McCaskill told reporters. “I was in a group of senators talking about international adoption. It wasn’t anything about armed services, it wasn’t one-on-one.” \nShe also says the word “from” should have been in tweet, but she didn’t have room with the 140 characters a tweet allows. \nHer office added this statement: \nAttorney General Sessions met one-on-one with the Russian ambassador in the midst of a Russian cyber campaign against the U.S., and then misled the Judiciary Committee under oath about that meeting. He then tried to excuse it by saying it was part of the normal course of his Armed Services Committee work. Claire has never met one-on-one with the ambassador, and never received a call from him. She did attend a group meeting about adoptions with other Senators, and had a brief proactive call with the ambassador amid calls to several other parties to the Iran nuclear deal. Attorney General Sessions, on the other hand, misled the Senate under oath. \nHer Missouri colleague, U.S. Senator Roy Blunt, says of the Sessions controversy, “I take him at his word.” \nI know and have worked with Attorney General Sessions. He has said he had no discussions with Russian officials regarding the election, and I take him at his word. Part of the job of a United States Senator involves talking to the ambassadors of countries. I’ve talked to at least twenty ambassadors in the last six weeks. It would have been very normal for Sessions, as a senator, to have talked to the Russian ambassador without discussing the election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T10:07:54.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
