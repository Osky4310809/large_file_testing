He chose not to submit Noisey's Album of 2016 , Blonde , and he's declined invitations to attend the ceremony. He's already calmly offered his reasons for sitting this year out , but a Rolling Stone podcast with Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich and writer David Wild, in which they criticized Ocean for his 2013 performance at the awards show, has pushed the artist a step further. In a Tumblr post last night, he unleashed first on Ehrlich and Wild, then on the Grammys as an institution. He is now the winner of the Grammys. \n\"Ok Ken (and David),\" he writes. \"As much as I hate to make you guys famous or even respond to you directly. We all die one day and you're old so fuck it.\" He takes particular exception to Wild's notion that Ocean is sitting this year out because of the awkward performance of \"Forrest Gump\" four years ago. \"Yea yea my 2013 performance at the Grammys was absolute shit. Technical difficulties, blah blah. Thanks for the reminder. Very much appreciated. Fuck that performance though. You think that's why I kept my work out of the Grammy process this year? Don't you think I would've wanted to play the show to 'redeem' myself if I felt that way?\" \nOcean goes on to say that he considered joining the planned Prince tribute at this year's ceremony but that, instead, \"my best tribute to that man's legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful[...] Blonde sold a million plus without a label, that's successful. I am young, black, gifted and independent.. that's my tribute.\" \nHe ends up throwing Ehrlich and Wild's words back at them. They described Ocean's 2013 performance as \"faulty,\" and \"not great TV.\" And Ocean won't let it slide. \"You know what's really not 'great TV' guys? 1989 getting album of the year over To Pimp A Butterfly . Hands down one of the most 'faulty' TV moments I've seen.\" \n\"I'm one of the best alive,\" he writes. \"And if you're up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I'm all for it. Have a good night.\" \nFrank Ocean is the winner of this year's Grammys.
