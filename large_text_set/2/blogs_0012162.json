Bridgewater replied with Google. He then showed her photos of the work at the tech company, which evidently left a mark on her. She said she too wanted to work at Google. So she submitted an application in the form of a letter. \nThe letter, posted on Business Insider and CNBC , starts with \"Dear Google Boss.\" \nThe rest is priceless. \n\"My name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with Google,\" the hand-scrawled letter said. \"I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics.\" \nShe then mentions some of the job perks. \n\"My dad said I can sit on bean bags and go down slides and ride go-karts in a job in Google,\" she wrote. \"I like computers too and have a tablet I play games on.\" \nThe ending doesn't disappoint. \n\"My dad told me to give you a application to get a job in Google,\" she wrote. \"I don't really know what one of them is but he said a letter will do for now. Thank you for reading my letter, I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father Christmas. Goodbye.\" \nFour days later, Bridgewater said, Google CEO Sundar Pichai responded. Bridgewater posted the letter on Twitter. Google confirmed the letter was from Pichai, but added the company wouldn't comment because it was personal. my 7 yr old daughter wrote to the boss of Google asking for a job, she's so made up he replied! Thanks @sundarpichai pic.twitter.com/EMuANNHiVc — Andy Bridgewater (@B21DGY) February 13, 2017 \n\"I'm glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology,\" Pichai wrote. \"I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to — from working at Google to swimming in the Olympics. I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school!\" \nHe signed it with a smiley face and wished the best to the Bridgewaters, who live in Hereford, England. \nAndy Bridgewater said his daughter was \"over the moon\" about the letter and now hopes to get invited to tour the Google facilities in California. \nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2llVuic NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.
