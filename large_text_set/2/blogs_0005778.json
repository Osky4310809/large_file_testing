Afp / AFP / Getty Images ID: 10476438 By the end of the century, oil tankers and cargo ships, with only the occasional help of icebreakers, will safely ply Russia’s Arctic coast for more than half the year if global warming continues unabated, a group of Russian scientists say.\nThe study , funded by the Russian government, was released by the journal Environmental Review Letters on Monday evening. It comes as a powerful North Atlantic storm is poised to smash into the Arctic Ocean for the third time this winter, perhaps pushing its temperatures above the freezing mark — also for the third time — in a year that has already set records for limited sea ice.\n“Further warming in the Arctic will promote the Northern Sea Route (NSR) as an alternative to the conventional Suez or Panama Canal routes for intercontinental shipping,” wrote Vyacheslav Khon, a climate scientist at Kiel University, and his colleagues in the study.\n“The study appears to be a sound analysis of the present future navigability of the Northern Sea Route,” geographer Scott Stephenson of the University of Connecticut, told BuzzFeed News.\nThis winter, Arctic sea ice has been absurdly low . According to the latest monthly report from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, only 4.67 million square miles of the Arctic Ocean was covered in ice in December 2016, the second lowest total the center has even recorded for that month. October and November set all-time lows for those months.\nAnd now, the National Weather Service projects a whopper of a North Atlantic storm will pack 90 mile-per-hour hurricane strength winds into the Arctic Ocean between Greenland and Iceland this week, breaking up even more sea ice.\nIncredible satellite imagery of powerful hurricane force system churning in the central #Atlantic - ASCAT passes co… https://t.co/zE5D6Vvfn3\n— NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) ID: 10476523 All of this renews focus on a longstanding Russian effort to open up the Arctic.\nFor centuries, Europeans explorers had sought (but mostly failed) to find the “Northwest Passage” between Asia and Europe through the Canadian Arctic. But those sailors would have had better luck if they tried the Russian side.\nIn an accident of geography, the Russian Arctic coastline is blemished with fewer islands than the North American side. That open ocean allows fewer thick chunks of ice from near the North Pole and more warm water from the south to accumulate along the Russian coast, causing the summer season of ice-free waterways to be longer in Russia than it is in Canada and Alaska.\nThat geographic edge has spurred investment from Russia, including the construction of a fleet of nuclear icebreakers and a $33 billion year-round Arctic seaport.\n“Russia is the Arctic country that is investing to the greatest degree in their Arctic territory,” Scott Stephenson, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Connecticut, told BuzzFeed News. “Whereas there are no deepwater ports in the Canadian Arctic and very few settlements, at least by way of comparison there’s more infrastructure and more ports along the northern Russia coast.”\nAmong the economic activity already happening are nickel mines in the Russian interior shipping metal to world markets through the Arctic. Warming there portends more economic opportunities, according to the study.\nView this image ›\nA Russian icebreaker at the port of Sabetta in the Kara Sea in 2015.

It would take decades to pump all that oil and gas — enough time for the loss of sea ice driven by climate change to make a dent in the economics of Arctic shipping. Ironically, burning all that Russian oil would add more greenhouse gases, which are largely responsible for the global warming that is melting the Arctic , to the atmosphere.\nBut as Exxon knows through the Exxon Valdez oil spill, in which the oil tanker veered off course into a rocky reef while trying to avoid small icebergs in Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989, the presence of even a little ice makes navigation treacherous.\n“There’s no way that this means that Arctic navigation is going to be as safe as navigation elsewhere in the world at lower latitudes,” Stephenson said. “Even if the ice is receding, you’ll always have the possibility of smaller ice encounters.”\nID: 10476580 6.\nThere Is A Searing Scientific Debate About Missing Arctic Ice\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10476497 5.\nArctic Sea Ice Is Freakishly Low Right Now\nbuzzfeed.com\nID: 10476490", "external_links": ["https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf", "https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed/status/828425145467416577", "https://t.co/zE5D6Vvfn3", "http://barentsobserver.com/en/business/2013/12/northern-sea-route-no-alternative-suez-deputy-minister-19-12", "http://mashable.com/2017/02/06/storm-will-warm-north-pole-melting-point/?utm_cid=hp-hh-sec#R_3B6i1wJaqP", "http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2017/01/low-sea-ice-extent-continues-in-both-poles/", "http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa5841"], "published": "2017-02-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:10:08.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
