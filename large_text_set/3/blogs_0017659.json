But if you put in some effort to research before buying a phone and choosing a provider, there are ways you can save a lot of money on your bill. What you save can amount to hundreds in a few years. Here are some tricks for saving on your cell phone.\nâ€” Additional reporting by Emily Co\n1. Sign up for a no-contract deal : Although you can save up to hundreds on a new smartphone if you sign up for a contract deal, you can sometimes save more if you opt for a no-contract deal and pay full price for the phone. Even though you'll have to pay more for the phone up front, you can save in the long run in some cases. Also, if you decide to switch providers, then you won't have to pay any penalties, because you're not under contract. And that's not all; some carriers even offer no-interest payment plans for the phones, so even if you can't afford to pay the full price upfront, you can pay it off in installments.\n2. Comparison shop : The first rule of getting the best bang for your buck on anything is to shop around. Check out what phone and plan best suit your needs. You can compare different carrier plans and pricing with ease by going to WhistleOut . Just input your information and how you want to use the plan, and the site will give you a list of suggestions and the breakdown of each plan.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/pBqyrAO7QL75EYyM1d4DPryvrXg/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2015/07/23/728/n/1922398/210b72b3_POPSUGAR_03.28.15_ProductVignette_119-1.jpg", "http://www.whistleout.com/CellPhones"], "published": "2017-03-18T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-19T07:20:41.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
