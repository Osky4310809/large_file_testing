I started running in the summer of 2013. I was barely able to run 3 miles continuously at the time, but I have now been running for almost four years.

I started running as a way to lose weight for the sport of lightweight rowing. With a weight requirement for lightweight rowing, there is no wiggle room to be just a few pounds over, let alone close to thirty. Having been a Division I rower in college, I couldn’t believe how far I had come physically and thought running, as well as training full-time, was my way back. \nHow often do you run? In a typical week I run three to four times, but if it’s during a training cycle it could be upwards of six to seven times. \nWhat is your routine? Living in Boston means endless running routes around the famous Charles River. I typically try to get out for a morning 5 to 7 mile loop around the river before work, and I will occasionally join a local club, the Heartbreakers, for evening interval workouts. On Saturdays, it is great to get out to the suburbs of Newton and go for a longer run along part of the Boston Marathon course. \nDo you race? If so, how often, and what kind of races? I try and run a race (5K, 10K, or half marathon) at least once every few months. Also, for the past three years I have run a marathon every year, including two this past year ( The Boston Marathon and The New York City Marathon ). I have even dabbled in a 200 mile Ragnar relay race, which is safe to say the longest I’ve ever run in 28 hours. \nRELATED: How to Run an Overnight Relay Race \nDo you engage in other sports or activities? If so, what and how often? I still row competitively in the fall season, competing in the lightweight women’s four plus—having finally made it down to weight—at the Head of the Charles Regatta. We’ve medaled the past two years. \nWhat’s the most rewarding part of running for you? The most rewarding part of running for me is the feeling you get when your legs just start taking over and your mind stops thinking about how terrible you feel. It’s an amazing feeling to just lose all your worries about the workday or the things you need to get done and focus only on the rhythm of your breathing and how easy you can make it feel. Getting faster and striving for PRs is also a plus. \nPlease describe your weight loss journey, including your before and after weights. I graduated college being a four year Division I athlete, never having to worry or think about what I ate. The real world doesn’t work that way. I gained over 20 pounds in 11 months after graduating college from a combination of reduced physical activity and lack of monitoring and control of what I ate. \nEat more nourishing meals with the Run Fast Eat Slow cookbook from Olympian Shalane Flanagan. \nAfter a year of a sedentary lifestyle, I decided that I wanted to get back to what I loved—rowing. I joined a local club in Boston and promised them that while it doesn’t look like it now—standing at 5’ 6 and 165 pounds—I could get down to lightweight or 130 pounds. I started eating right, training all the time, and proving to everyone—especially myself—that I could transform myself into who I used to be. Each week throughout this process, I was required to “weigh-in,” meaning a coach would have me get on a scale and tell myself how much weight I had lost. I started running and cross-training in addition to our scheduled rowing workouts and saw the pounds start slipping away. \nAfter about 10 months of training and trying to be strict about eating clean, I had lost 24 pounds. I looked like my old self—maybe even a little better—and felt great again, too. But I had an issue, I had stopped losing weight. No matter what diet I kept myself to, or how many times a week I worked out, I couldn’t lose those last darn nine pounds. It came time to make a smart life decision, and I ended up leaving the rowing program I was training with to better focus my time on my health and professional life. It was the best decision I could have made. \nI dedicated the majority of my workouts just to running and quickly fell in love with it. I was running half marathons with my friends on the weekends, and setting goals for myself I couldn’t even have imagined before. All the while, I was continuously losing weight. I had stopped paying attention to the number on the scale and started enjoying my runs, and almost like magic, I hit lightweight of 130 pounds. With this new found love of running and a body that was designated as fit to compete, I started rowing again. Running provided me with not only a life-long love for a sport, but also the ability to go back to a sport that I’ve loved for 12 years. \nWhat is the secret to your weight loss success? I stay diligent about not eating to substitute or mask emotions, as well as not eating when I’m tired or when I’m bored. When I run, I find that my appetite is actually reduced and I am more likely to crave protein rich foods that will help keep me full longer as opposed to sugary, starchy, and empty calorie foods. Also, drinking lots of water helps. \nHow do you stay motivated? I tell myself that future me will appreciate it, and if you can make it through that 45 minute or an hour run, you’ll be happier at the end than if you didn’t do it. Signing up for races is also a great way to keep the motivation alive. \nDo you have any favorite motivational quotes? As cliche as it might be, Kelly Clarkson said it right: “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” \nWhat are your current short and long term goals? A short term goal of mine is to break 1:30:00 in the half marathon, and while doing so train for a half iron man this summer. \nIs there anything else you’d like to tell us? I was reluctant to call myself a “runner.” But after running three Boston Marathon qualifying times, I’ve finally embraced the idea! \n* * * \nWe want to hear how running changed you!
