Ferdinand urges United to sign both Bale and Griezmann \nBut United are still unsure if that will be enough to persuade him to come to Old Trafford and are enlisting Paul Pogba to help with the transfer, according to the Daily Record . \nGriezmann has spoken of his desire to play with close friend Pogba at club level at some point in their careers and United are hoping a few words from their record signing will help them in their pursuit of the forward. \nAnthony Martial is becoming increasingly frustrated with life under Mourinho, according to The Times , after the United boss criticised him for failing to take his chances. \nMartial was linked with a move to Sevilla this transfer window and the Portuguese’s latest comments are likely to give the Frenchman further reason to reconsider his future. \nHowever, it could be Mourinho and not Martial who leaves Old Trafford first, report Spanish outlet Don Balon . \nThey report that the former Real Madrid manager maintains a close relationship with president Florentino Perez and he could be targeted for a return to the Bernabeu should the Champions League holders falter further after their Copa del Rey exit. \nPerez is reportedly already considering replacing Zidane, despite their Spanish record for consecutive games without loss.
