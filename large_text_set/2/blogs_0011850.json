It is a mono-purpose political entity. \n“Those driving this always wanted a hard Brexit. Indeed, even the term ‘hard Brexit’ requires amendment. The policy is now ‘Brexit at any cost’.” \nMr Blair, who led Labour to three general election victories, will argue that in the 23 June referendum the British people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit and that as these become clear, “it is their right to change their mind”. How Brexit affected Britain's favourite foods from Weetabix to Marmite How Brexit affected Britain's favourite foods from Weetabix to Marmite 1/8 Weetabix \nChief executive of Weetabix Giles Turrell has warned that the price of one of the nation’s favourite breakfast are likely to go up this year by low-single digits in percentage terms. Reuters 2/8 Nescafé \nThe cost of a 100g jar of Nescafé Original at Sainsbury’s has gone up 40p from £2.75 to £3.15 – a 14 per cent rise—since the Brexit vote. PA 3/8 Freddo \nWhen contacted by The Independent this month, a Mondelez spokesperson declined to discuss specific brands but confirmed that there would be \"selective\" price increases across its range despite the American multi-national confectionery giant reporting profits of $548m (£450m) in its last three-month financial period. Mondelez, which bought Cadbury in 2010, said rising commodity costs combined with the slump in the value of the pound had made its products more expensive to make. Cadbury 4/8 Mr Kipling cakes \nPremier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling and Bisto gravy, said that it was considering price rises on a case-by-case basis Reuters 5/8 Walkers Crisps \nWalkers, owned by US giant PepsiCo, said \"the weakened value of the pound\" is affecting the import cost of some of its materials. A Walkers spokesman told the Press Association that a 32g standard bag was set to increase from 50p to 55p, and the larger grab bag from 75p to 80p. Getty 6/8 Marmite \nTesco removed Marmite and other Unilever household brand from its website last October, after the manufacturer tried to raise its prices by about 10 per cent owing to sterling’s slump. Tesco and Unilever resolved their argument, but the price of Marmite has increased in UK supermarkets with the grocer reporting a 250g jar of Marmite will now cost Morrisons’ customers £2.64 - an increase of 12.5 per cent. Rex 7/8 Toblerone \nToblerone came under fire in November after it increased the space between the distinctive triangles of its bars. Mondelez International, the company which makes the product, said the change was made due to price rises in recent months. Pixabay 8/8 Maltesers \nMaltesers, billed as the “lighter way to enjoy chocolate”, have also shrunk in size. Mars, which owns the brand, has reduced its pouch weight by 15 per cent. Mars said rising costs mean it had to make the unenviable decision between increasing its prices or reducing the weight of its Malteser packs. iStockphoto \nHaving previously argued that a second referendum or election may be needed to determine the country’s future, he will say: “Our challenge is to expose relentlessly the actual cost, to show how [the referendum] decision was based on imperfect knowledge which will now become informed knowledge, to calculate in ‘easy-to-understand’ ways how proceeding will cause real damage to the country and its citizens and to build support for finding a way out from the present rush over the cliff’s edge. \n“I don’t know if we can succeed. But I do know we will suffer a rancorous verdict from future generations if we do not try.” \nThe ex-politician has gifted more than £9m to his new policy unit for centre-ground politics, the Tony Blair Institute, with the fight against Brexit likely to form a key part of its work. \nIn his speech he was due to set out how the issue of immigration has been twisted by Eurosceptics to win support for the rush to the exit door. \nHe will say: “For many people, the core of the immigration question – and one which I fully accept is a substantial issue – is immigration from non-European countries especially when from different cultures in which assimilation and potential security threats can be an issue. Legislation to allow PM to start formal Brexit talks clears first Commons hurdle \n“Nonetheless, we have moved in a few months from a debate about what sort of Brexit, involving a balanced consideration of all the different possibilities, to the primacy of one consideration – namely, controlling immigration from the EU – without any real discussion as to why Brexit doesn't affect the immigration people most care about. \n“Yet we’re told we have to stop debating it and just do it.” \nMr Blair will also warn that Ms May’s drive for Brexit will strain the debate over Scottish independence and put peace in Northern Ireland at risk. \nHe will say: “In addition to all this, the possibility of the break-up of the UK – narrowly avoided by the result of the Scottish referendum – is now back on the table, but this time with a context much more credible for the independence case. Theresa May calls Brexit a 'great moment of national change' \n“We are already seeing the destabilising impact of worry over border arrangements on the Northern Ireland peace process. \n“None of this ignores the challenges the country faces in common with many other countries; those left behind by globalisation; the aftermath of the financial crisis; stagnant incomes amongst a section of the public; and for sure the pressures posed by big increases in migration, which make perfectly reasonable people anxious and feeling unheard in their anxiety.” \nIn an article for French newspaper Le Figaro today, Ms May will say Britain is not seeking to “cherry-pick” which parts of EU membership it wants to keep after Brexit, stating that her aim is to leave the single market, and strike a free trade deal including the “greatest possible access” to the trade bloc. \nShe will host talks with Mr Cazeneuve at Downing Street, in a bid to underline how it is in France’s interests to strike a quick and mutually beneficial deal with Britain. \nBut the recent report from the French Prime Minister’s compatriots in the his country’s senate suggests the divorce terms of Brexit must be completed before negotiations on Britain’s future trading relations, adding that the UK’s final agreement must not place it in a better position outside the EU.
