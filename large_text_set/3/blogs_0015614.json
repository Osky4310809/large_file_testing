You can stop your bullshit now. \nI know, I know it's not that simple--the hydra has more than one head. To Hell In A Ha... Mar 20, 2017 1:04 PM \nHow long have a few of us said, \"Trump will not dismiss Comey\"? Come on fellow Zerohedgers, given the shit Comey & McCabe have caused Trump, it fucking defies all known logic for Trump to keep them in their position. This latest Tweet by Trump says it all, yet Trump won't remove him, as a few of us claimed from the outset. The answer is staring you Trumptards in the face, but you refuse to acknowledge it. Trump is compromised somewhere/somehow and given all whats come to light, my money is on his trips on the Lolita Express and his stays on Epstein's Island. Now who is grabbed by the pussy? roadhazard Mar 20, 2017 1:04 PM \nIf asked that question and someone could ask it Comey would not be able to answer as per policy. You (and the President) all need to listen instead of making shit up. If @POTUS IS Trump then he continues to show his ignorance. \nAnd whether Flynn was talked about or not means ZERO. Flynn is still guilty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T19:14:15.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
