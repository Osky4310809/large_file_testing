Now a teaser trailer for the short has arrived online, which you can check out in the player below! The Red Nose Day Special is set to air May 25 on NBC and March 24’s Red Nose Day in the U.K. on BBC1. \nFrom an original script by Curtis, the short film revisits the characters of the 2003 film Love Actually to discover what they’re up to in 2017. \nRevisiting their roles from the beloved movie are cast members Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, Colin Firth, Lucia Moniz, Liam Neeson, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Olivia Olson, Bill Nighy, Marcus Brigstocke and Rowan Atkinson. \nRichard Curtis said, “Over the years I’ve enjoyed doing Red Nose Day specials of TV things I’ve worked on – ‘Blackadder,’‘The Vicar of Dibley’ and ‘Mr Bean.’ It seemed like a fun idea this year to do a special sketch based one of my films, since Red Nose Day is now in both the UK and America. I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to ‘Love Actually,’ but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to. Who has aged best? – I guess that’s the big question… or is it so obviously Liam? We’ve been delighted and grateful that so many of the cast are around and able to take part – and it’ll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later. We hope to make something that’ll be fun – very much in the spirit of the original film and of Red Nose Day – and which we hope will help bring lots of viewers and cash to the Red Nose Day shows.” \nFor the third year of Red Nose Day in the U.S., Americans across the country will come together, wear their Red Noses (available exclusively at Walgreens and Duane Reade locations nationwide), and raise money and awareness to help children living in poverty in America and around the world. With the support of millions of generous Americans, major partners and hundreds of celebrities, Red Nose Day has raised more than $60 million in its first two years since launching in the U.S. in 2015. \nFor more information, visit the Red Nose Day website at RedNoseDay.org .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T17:28:09.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
