She’s been named in multiple reports as Rosalind Ross, or Rosey to her friends. Ross is a champion equestrian vaulter, a sport that requires participants to dance and perform gymnastic routines on horseback. He’s 59, she’s 24. The couple were seen out together in Los Angeles just after the 2016 Golden Globe awards, reported TMZ. \n  Mel Whisked Her Away to His 500 Acre Compound in Costa Rica Recently Ross and Gibson arrive at the screening of Summit Entertainment’s Hacksaw Ridge at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater on October 24, 2016 in Beverly Hills. (Getty) \nThe two first met when she applied for a job at Gibson’s production company, Icon. Radar Online reports that following that meeting, the two jetted down to Costa Rica to spend time on his compound. From there, the couple went to Panama. Radar, quoting a source, says “It’s clear the two of them are really happy together…Mel hasn’t had the best luck with the ladies. He’s in no rush to turn his relatively new romance into a high-profile affair.” \nA close friend of Ross’s, Devon Maitozo, told the Daily Mail that Ross is having a hard time dealing with the attention she’s getting. Maitozo said, “There’s been a lot of very not very nice media that’s been written about her. Sifting through it has not been very pleasant at all. Sensationalizing her because of her relationships is not what she’s looking for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:48:29.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
