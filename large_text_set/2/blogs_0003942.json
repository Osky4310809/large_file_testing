Discussing sex is still viewed as taboo in our culture even though proper education about consent and safe sex would positively impact many people. While we continue to fight for evidence-based sexual education in schools, alternative methods have emerged. \nOne such method is from actually from one of the largest porn websites in the world, Pornhub. According to USA Today the new Pornhub website will “cover topics ranging from reproductive health, STDs and STIs to sexuality and relationship building.” Clinical psychologist Laurie Betto will be director of this new site. \nCorey Price, Vice-president of Pornhub, released the following statement: \n“We understand the importance of educating the general public on a wide range of topics pertaining to sexual health and awareness, and saw an opportunity to deliver knowledge and understanding through renowned doctors and experts,” \nToo often pornography is used as a really bad sexual education for teens. Pornhub hosts 70 million daily users so if even a fraction of them could learn something from this new site, that would be great!
