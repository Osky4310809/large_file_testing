Naughty Graham.\" \nThis sparked a debate about the rights and wrongs of Mark and Linda's tricky situation. \nPauline Devlin simply wrote: \"Good on ya Linda.\" \nBut Richard Consoli said: \"Too many stereotypes sometimes.

Graham might be regretting his little fling!\" \nAndrew Robins said: \"Saw these all over Warwick today. I think Graham might be in trouble #naughtyboy #womanscorned\" \nThe posters appear to have been professionally printed, with a link to the website of a design company called Throwing Rocks at the bottom of each one.
