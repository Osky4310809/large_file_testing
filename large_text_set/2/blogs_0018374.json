Trump ‘s move will send the decision to the states.\n“I have a message for the trans kids of America: You’re winning. I know it doesn’t fee like it today or every day, but you’re winning,” Caitlyn said in a video message she shared on Twitter . “Very soon we will win full freedom nation-wide and it’s going to be with bipartisan support. You can help by checking out the National Center for Transgender Equality and letting Washington hear you loud and clear.”\nCaitlyn also sent a message to bullies and then one directly to Trump .\n“I have a message for President Trump from one Republican to another. This is a disaster. And you can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me,” she said. Watch below!\nWell @realDonaldTrump , from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community.
