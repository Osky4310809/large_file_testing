The menu reads like a classified document rife with spy puns. SafeHouse also emphasizes they make almost all the food on premises as they want to break the notion that they’re just a downtown tourist trap at 60 E. Ontario St. It’s a bit disturbing to see a black and white photo of Russian President Vladimir Putin with words covering his eyes reading “control is watching.” But there are no traces of Central Asia on the menu. It’s a familiar collection of American bar food with chicken tenders, wings and nachos. SafeHouse, which debuted in 1966 in Milwaukee, also keeps track of their roots in America’s Dairyland. They’re serving hand-breaded cheese curds, called “Fried C4 Cheese Curds.” Perhaps there’s the insinuation that they will explode with taste in diners’ mouths. Burgers, wraps, mac and cheese, and ribs round out the menu. It’s not the same as the menu in Milwaukee with additions like a New York strip steak, tacos, and a grilled cheese named after Goldfinger from James Bond. The design of the SafeHosue space and the spy experience attract most visitors, but the food’s not an afterthought. Even spies have to eat. SafeHouse knows you can’t gather intelligence on an empty stomach so check out the full menu below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:23:07.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
