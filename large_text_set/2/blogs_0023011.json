Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA pensioner stuck in a Dubai hospital faces a prison sentence because his business went under. \nMalcolm Munroe, 70, had a stroke three years ago and has been bedbound ever since. \nHis construction company crashed after his illness and creditors demanded payment. \nAfter a court case in Dubai, he was handed a three year jail term over the unpaid debts. \nMr Munroe can barely move his head, is fed through a tube and is connected to an oxygen tank. \nHis wife and sons are 4,600 miles away after she flew to the UK for cancer treatment. \nAnd his family say anyone linked to his company risks arrest if they set foot in Dubai. \nHis sister, Diane Kirkwood, 68, has appealed to MPs, the Foreign Office, the UK Embassy in Dubai and even Prince Charles in a bid to help her brother. Olga Munroe says her boys are pining for their dad (Photo: MEN) \nShe said: “It is heartbreaking for his wife, sons and us. We cannot go to visit him, we have to wait until somebody he knew in Dubai goes to see him and lets us know how he is. \n“One person sends a photograph of him each week just lying in hospital. \n“He turned 70 last November and we wonder how much longer he can survive.” \nMalcolm, from Chorlton, Manchester, moved to the Middle East in the 1980s and later set up his own firm, employing hundreds of men. \nWhile there he married his Ukrainian wife Olga and the couple have two sons, Alexandre, 16, and Paul, 14. \nWhen Olga, 40, became ill, she and the boys flew back to Manchester.

Olga had to fly back to Manchester due to illness (Photo: MEN) \nHis sister said: “Anybody connected with the company will be asked to pay the debts owed when they enter the country. We wanted to visit for his 70th birthday but we were worried we would be stopped. We are worried we wouldn’t get any further than the airport.” \nFriends have raised money to pay for a private flight to bring Malcolm back to the UK to continue his treatment. \nBut his sister said the Dubai authorities must first agree to release him. \n“It is so sad to think his two sons, his wife and his family may never get to see him again. His family are in a mess and his sons are pining for him” she said.

Our friend says sometimes a tear will trickle down his face when he shows him pictures of the boys or Olga. \n“You close your eyes and just picture him lying there with no family there to see him. \n“We can’t afford to pay solicitors fees as my husband and I are both pensioners and Malcolm’s wife can’t afford it. But we’d appreciate any advice.
