Apple \nThe device is part of Apple's long-running partnership of with the (RED) organisation, with money from each sale going towards HIV/AIDS research and relief efforts. It's the most interesting-looking iPhone Apple has built in a long time — a welcome relief from the gold-and-grey monotony that plagues many modern smartphones. \nApart from the new colour, it's the same old iPhone 7 — but it's only available in the more expensive 128 GB and 256 GB models, with no option to buy a 64 GB version. \nIf you visit the Apple Store website today, you're greeted with a placeholder message saying \"we've got something special in store for you,\" and it asks you to check back later. \nIt doesn't explicitly state what's coming, but both the red iPhone and the new iPad are scheduled to go on sale today. \nThe store will come back online at 8.01 AM Pacific Time — 11.01 AM Eastern time, or 3.01 PM in the UK.
