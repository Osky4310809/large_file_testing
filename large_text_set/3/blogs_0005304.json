Meaning, the Flyers are partially paying for a player now on the Penguins’ roster. \nStreit appeared in 49 games with the Philadelphia Flyers this season. The 39-year-old defenseman has scored five goals and added 16 assists. \nStay With KDKA.com For More Details", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T08:50:39.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
