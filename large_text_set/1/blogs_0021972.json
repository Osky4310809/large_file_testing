Durkin | 7:30   \nIt is no secret that Vicente Fox , the former President of Mexico, is not a fan of President Donald Trump . Fox memorably spoke out against Trump during the campaign season, famously saying that Mexico is not paying “ for that fucking wall .” He added to his greatest hits collection by calling the Republican nominee an “ ugly American ,” a “ hated gringo ,” and casually noted that Trump’s anti-Mexican rhetoric was little more than a “ political stunt .” \nAnd on Friday’s Morning Joe , Fox continued his verbal assault against the U.S. President, telling POTUS directly: “President Trump, please grow up.” \nFox furthered his longstanding comparisons between Trump and Adolf Hitler — something that they Morning Joe panel largely found to be an unfair connection — and noted that the cancellation of a planned meeting with current Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto was not a mutual decision as Trump alleged Thursday. \n“We take you seriously,” Fox said on Morning Joe Friday. “So seriously that President Nieto decided not to come to the United States. It was not a mutual decision.” The planned meeting was curtailed after the Trump administration floated ( then abruptly pulled back from ) a proposed 20% border tax on imported goods to fund the construction of the southern border wall. \n“It was our President’s decision, because we are offended,” Fox said. “When he comes to Congress and says ‘I need the money or the wall, I need $25 billion for the wall,’ what is Congress going to say?” Fox indicated again that the funds for the wall project will not come from Mexico, but rather the American taxpayers. \nWatch above via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T14:54:59.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
