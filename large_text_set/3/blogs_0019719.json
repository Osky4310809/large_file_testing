PUBLISHED: 22:52,   23:00, Thu, Mar 16, 2017 \nAfter beating FC Rostov courtesy of Juan Mata's 10th goal of the season, Mourinho expressed his anger at the fixture planners who gave United an FA Cup tie at Chelsea on Monday and a Premier League noon kick-off at Middlesbrough on Sunday. \nHe said: “We were afraid of extra time. It was a difficult game. We have lots of enemies. \n\"Normally the enemies should be Rostov but we have a lot of enemies. It's difficult to play Monday with 10 men, it's difficult to play now, it's difficult to play 12 o’clock on Sunday. We have a lot of enemies. \n\"A lot of people might say we should have scored more goals. But a lot of things are going against us. The boys are amazing boys. We will probably lose the game on Sunday. Fatigue has a price. \n\"I will remember forever when I spoke to the UEFA delegate in Rostov. He told me if any of our players gets injured, the insurance paid. Whoever decided the Monday and Sunday games probably thinks the same way.” EMPICS SPORT/ GETTY Jose Mourinho claimed United have 'many enemies' GETTY Jose Mourinho voiced his displeasure at United's fixture pile-up \nA blow for United is the loss of Paul Pogba, who limped off with a hamstring injury ealry in the second half and is certain to miss Sunday's trip to the Riverside. \nMatch winner Mata was about to be replaced by Marcus Rashford but ball didn't go out before he struck in the 70th minute. \nHe said: \"It was matter of finishing off our chances again. We created chances but we couldn't finish. To win it is our aim. We want to win every tournament we play in. \nThe level of teams left is good and it will be difficult. We want to play Champions League football next season and this is one way to do it \nSkipper Chris Smalling praised No 2 keeper Sergio Romero who made three stunning seocnd half saves, including a last kick of the game effort form Koren Bayramyan. He said: \"We know we have two quality keepers and whoever selected.\" \nThe other seven teams in today's quarter-final draw are Besiktas, Genk, Ajax, Celta Vigo, Schalke, Lyon and Anderlecht. \nIn a BBC interview, Mourinho admitted that United \"are not ready to be a dominant force\" and fans should forget about a return to the days of Sir Alex Ferguson. Manchester United player ratings against Rostov Thu, March 16, 2017 1 of 12 Click for the Manchester United player ratings against Rostov \nUnited won 13 Premier League titles under Ferguson, but Mourinho says it is now impossible to be so dominant. \nAsked if he could return the club to its former greatness, the Portuguese said: \"Forget it. Don't try to go 10, 20 years ago because it is not possible any more.\" \nHe also insisted United do not need to qualify for the Champions League to attract top players, he would not have sold forwards Angel di Maria, Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck had he been United manager and it has en easy for midfielder Paul Pogba to adjust back to English football. \n\"We are not ready to be Manchester United. We are minant force. We are not ready to try and win everything. \n\"Because of the nature of the club, and of myself, we are ready to fight for every game, every point. But there is a space between the general ambition of such a giant club and what we are in reality.\" \nMourinho said United - who beat Premier League champions Leicester City in the Community Shield in August had won \"one and a half\" trophies this season. \n\"Many other teams in England are going to finish the season without a trophy,\" he said. \"But we have to fight for the top four, we have to fight for the Champions League. The cup is not enough to say that the season is over.\" \nMourinho took charge, United have spent an estimated £150m on midfielders Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan and defender Eric Bailly, and brought in striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic for free. \nBut the Portuguese said the club's previous transfer dealings caused him concern. \nHe named three forwards - PSG's Angel di Maria, Bayer Leverkusen's Javier Hernandez and Arsenal's Danny Welbeck - as players he would not have sold. \n\"I found a sad club,\" he said. \"Manchester United sold players that I would never sell, bought players that I would never buy.\" \nMourinho would not name the players he would not have signed, but in January he allowed midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin and forward Memphis Depay to leave for Everton and Lyon respectively. GETTY Manchester United progressed into the Europa League quarter-finals \nHe has largely frozen out former Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger and has handed just seven league starts to left-back Luke Shaw, who cost £27m from Southampton in 2014. \nMourinho said he was not worried about attracting players this summer if United fail to qualify for the Champions League, pointing to last summer as proof the club can still sign the best players. \n\"Manchester United is very powerful, it doesn't need to be in the Champions League to attract the best players,\" he said. \n\"Zlatan could still be in Paris. Mkhitaryan could be at Borussia Dortmund. Pogba could be at Juventus. We were able to attract the players because they know that Manchester United sooner or later will get there. \n\"If any player decides not to come because of that, then I am happy that they are not coming.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T01:03:55.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
