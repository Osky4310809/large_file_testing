(Photo: Lucasfilm) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Last Jedi , the eighth Star Wars episode, won't be in theaters for another six months, but Disney is already mapping out what comes after Episode IX, according to The Hollywood Reporter .​ \n\"When we bought Lucasfilm, we were going to make three films — Episodes VII , VIII and IX ,\" CEO Bob Iger said Thursday at a tech and entertainment conference in Santa Monica, Calif. \"We’re starting talk about what could happen after Episode IX. About what could be another decade-and-a-half of Star Wars stories.\" \nHe then addressed the ghost in the room: How Last Jedi will be affected by the December death of franchise star Carrie Fisher, who will be honored at a public memorial service Saturday , along with her mother, Debbie Reynolds. \n\"We had to deal with tragedy at the end of 2016,\" he acknowledged, before asserting, \"Carrie appears throughout VIII . We are not changing VIII to deal with her passing. Her performance remains as it is in VIII. In Rogue One , we had some digital (characters). We are not doing that with Carrie.\" \nIger also spilled a few details about the stand-alone Han Solo film. He shared that the film will encompass the future rebel's life from age 18 to 24. Audiences will also see Alden Ehrenreich's Han first lay eyes upon his beloved Millennium Falcon and the origin of his friendship with Chewbacca (now played by Joonas Suotamo). \nFans will even be able to hop in the cockpit and take the Falcon for a virtual \"joyride\" thanks to Star Wars Lands at both of Disney's U.S. theme parks. \nStar Wars: The Last Jedi will hit theaters Dec. 15 this year, and the as-yet untitled Han Solo film will open on May 25, 2018.
