Last weekend we climbed up this canyon for sunrise and found the entire top blooming with purple! Go check it out if you can! \nA post shared by @zandtrick on Mar 8, 2017 at 7:06am PST \nThe small, nearby community of Borrego Springs more than doubled in size over the weekend — as an estimated 5,000 people poured in to the area to catch a glimpse of the nature phenomenon, according to the magazine.\nAs a result, the local sheriff was reportedly forced to close down several miles of road.\n“I’ll go out on a limb and say it’ll last probably a week or two,” Sally Theriault, interpreter with the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. \nExperts said that the spring bloom was ultimately caused by an extremely rainy fall and winter season, which came after a lengthy drought in California.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T03:19:30.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
