Sadly, it was a minor, no, a MAJOR blunder on the part of Steve Carell, who explained his tweet about The Office coming back.\nHonestly, we’ve got nothin’ but love for ya Steve, and we’ve heard what B.J. Novak said about your Office reboot tweet , but you clearly owe us a detailed breakdown of precisely what prompted your eager Twitter fingers to type “The Office is returning to NBC.” \n\nvia GIPHY \nThat’s least we can get from the man who nearly caused massive heart attacks and emotional breakdowns among crestfallen fans of The Office over what will go down in history as the most unforgettable (and possibly unforgivable) typo ever. So what does Carrel have to say for himself, hmm?\nBasically, Carrel responded like all the other celebrities who tweet awful stuff they’re too wimpy to own up to.\nMy account was hacked by Toby Flenderson.\n— Steve Carell (@SteveCarell) January 19, 2017 Well, color us shocked.\n\nvia GIPHY \nWe’re totally LBS when we say, nice try, Steve. Way to blame an online fiasco you started on your fictional workplace nemesis. We’re not saying that Toby would never pull something like this, but your explanation hardly takes the sting out of last night’s social media snafu. Or stunt. JUST TELL US WHETHER THIS WAS INTENTIONAL OR NOT, STEVE!\nWe doubt a straight-forward response from Carrell or a reunion of the Dunder Mifflin crew will happen anytime soon, but there’s always hope! Until then, it’s back to binge watching The Office on Netflix.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-20T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-20T01:59:09.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
