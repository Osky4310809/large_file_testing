Shares \nBethesda and id Software continues the slow trickle of Quake Champions gameplay footage, with the latest showcasing the hoverboard riding \"transhuman punk\" Anarki. As his status as a \"transhuman punk\" implies, this guy is not stuffing around: he has a hoverboard, which means he can move around quickly and fluidly mid-air, all the better to frag fools with. \nHis active ability is a health injection, which means he's able to heal himself on the fly. That doesn't seem very punk to me, but that's why it's punk: because it doesn't seem punk. \nWhile the game has no firm release date at present, it went into closed beta this month.
