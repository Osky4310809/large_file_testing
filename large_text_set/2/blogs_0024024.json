No foul play was suspected in the crashes, which were still being investigated.\n“It looks like it’s a tragic, modern age, ‘Romeo and Juliet’ kind of thing,” he said.\nJennifer Mae Shipcott, 45, was killed when her 2012 GMC Terrain tumbled more than 2,500 feet down the steep mountainside near Running Springs early Saturday.\nThe SUV was driven off the edge of a turnout along the road and came to rest on a lower portion of the highway, officials said. Shipcott died at the scene and the death was being investigated as a suicide, Quintero said.\nThat evening Shipcott’s boyfriend, Paul Albert Chuderski, 42, survived after he drove his 2005 Nissan Titan pickup off the road at the same location.\nInvestigators believe the second crash was an attempted suicide, Quintero said.\nAuthorities did not provide Chuderski’s condition Thursday.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:49:47.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
