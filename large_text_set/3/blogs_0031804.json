It says Theresa May will \"strike a note of conciliation\" with the EU, but that Labour warns it could be a \"national failure\" if the prime minister returned from Brussels without protecting jobs. Image caption The i paper also illustrates the story of the day with a map, showing a dotted-line around the UK, saying that Europe would \"block any deal\" unless its citizens can continue to move to Britain. Image caption Theresa May signing the letter which formally begins Britain's departure from the EU features on many front pages. The Times calls the move the beginning of a journey to the \"biggest political shake-up since the Second World War\". Image caption The Financial Times also uses the picture of Mrs May hand-signing the \"historic\" letter, but adds that the prime minister is willing to compromise to prevent the UK's 44-year relationship with Europe ending in \"acrimony\". Image caption The Daily Telegraph asserts that Mrs May's letter to European Council President Donald Tusk will include a broad outline of Britain's negotiating position, but it will not contain any mention of a cut-off date for migrants' rights. Image caption The Daily Mail hails Wednesday as a \"historic day for Britain\", but also marks a \"historic day for justice\" following the significant reduction in Royal Marine Alexander Blackman's prison sentence. Image caption The Daily Mirror reveals that Theresa May's letter will be hand-delivered to the European Council President Donald Tusk. Image caption The Sun has projected its headline onto a white cliff at Dover with the message: \"Dover and out\". Image caption A jubilant Daily Express writes of Mrs May's \"fierce determination\" to get the right deal for \"every single person in the country\". Image caption David Beckham's upcoming film role in King Arthur takes the Daily Star's lead, which jokes that the ex-footballer has got \"his knighthood after all\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T02:54:12.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
