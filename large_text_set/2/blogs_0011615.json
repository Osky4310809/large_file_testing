Adewole said this at the opening of the 29th annual scientific conference and general meeting of NAN at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital in Ile-Ife, Osun State on Monday. He commended the specialists for increasing the number of kidney transplantation done locally compared to the past when most patients were sent to India and the United Kingdom. Adewole said, “My challenge to the National Association of Nephrology is to ensure that no Nigeria goes out for renal transplant as from 2018.” The minister also challenged the association to work out how screening for kidney disorders could be included in the primary health system of the country. This, according to him, will ensure early detection and prompt treatment of such disorders. ”I will advise the association to develop algorithm to induct basic tests to screen for medical disorders including renal problems at the PHC. It is also important that your association should try and develop a functional national renal registry in the country. Government will offer its support for you in this assignment,” Adewole added. The President, Nigerian Association of Nephrology, Prof. Babatunde Salako, said that lack of resources was a major constraint to providing renal care in many parts of Nigeria. According to him, the rationing of services is still the order of the day in many parts of the country while appropriate training and retention of health care workers remained a challenge. Salako said, “One of the most important components of developing nephrology services is the training of nephrologist who will prioritise renal disease and seek out patients who need care. “However, the nephrologist to general population ratio in Nigeria is one of the lowest in the world making comprehensive delivery of renal care extremely challenging.” The association called on the Federal Government to arrest the brain drain of nephrologists and other health care workers through work incentives and He also asked the FG cover the cost of immunosuppressants for transplant patients and 24 dialysis sessions under the National Health Insurance Scheme.
