Close icon Chinatown Square is opening slowly at 1016-18 Race St. \nPoon and Taing expect to have 14 operators open from morning till late night. \nOver Christmas week, The Halal Guys opened with Middle Eastern beef and chicken platters and sandwiches in the front window of the two-story building. Following soon after was I•CE•NY, a branch of America's first Thai rolled ice cream shop. \nChinatown Square's soft opening, complete with lion dance, will be Jan. 28. \nThe lineup looks like this: \n\n\nTeaUs , a New York-based maker of bottle tea. \nPhilly Poké , serving the Hawaiian-style raw-fish called poké, as well as poke-ritos, sushi to go, musubi, and rice bowls; Andrew Hu, whose family owned Blue Pacific, a former tenant at the King of Prussia Mall, is in charge. \nKhmer Grill is a home-style Cambodian barbecue shop that previously set up among other vendors in FDR Park. Menu will include grilled chicken wings, beef sticks, homemade sausage, sticky rice, and Khmer papaya salad. \nKurry Korner , serving various curries. \nCoreano pairs Tim Liu of Monarch Philadelphia and chef Hee \"Chino\" Chang of Monach and Bop, who have developed a Mexican-Korean hybrid taco creation called the coreano. Among them: bulgogi tacos on corn tortillas with gochujang and Korean sweet peppers sauce with Mexican cheese; and carnitas with daikon kimchi slaw . \nThe Bao Bar will serve Chinese steam buns, with a full bar serving craft beers. \nHi Kori is literally \"fire and ice\" in Japanese, and general manager David Lee says fire and ice reflects the key components of the menu - mainly kushiyaki (fire) and craft cocktails (ice). Food also will include kushiyaki (meats/vegetables on skewers), an oyster bar, and a beverage program that includes tea-infused cocktails, sake, and Japanese whiskey. \nAccess Karaoke will have private karaoke rooms sponsored by different liquor brands. \nThe Johnnie Walker Lounge will be an open-seating-style bar lounge with music videos. It can be rented for private parties. \nPending are Dae Bak , a full-service, traditional Korean restaurant on the upper level, and a wine retailer called Cork and Bottle . A 14th shop is TBA.
