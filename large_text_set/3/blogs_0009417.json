Last Updated: 08/03/17 10:38am It's a Ferrari, as you've never seen it before! \nTo begin Day Two of the final Winter Test in Barcelona, Kimi Raikkonen's SF70-H was fitted with large aero sensors as the Scuderia looked to collect more data before the 2017 season starts. \nPre-season testing is often the time for aerodynamic parts to be trialled, but we've never seen rear additions quite as big as these... \nRaikkonen completed just a few laps with the rakes attached, before starting his longer runs. \nIt's been an impressive few weeks of testing for Ferrari so far, and they'll look to continue their progress - with the aero sensors, and without. \nThe Sky Sports F1 Digital team will be providing live commentary from dawn until dusk for all days of winter testing while Sky Sports News HQ will also deliver live updates from trackside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T13:31:14.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
