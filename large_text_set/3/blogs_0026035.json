He has since been awarded the Law Enforcement Purple Heart and Medal of Valor, the Post-Dispatch reported.   \nFlamion’s new “smart home,” controlled via cell phone, will provide him the independence of being able to control many simple household tasks that most of us take for granted, including controlling heating and cooling and opening and closing window blinds. \n“This home will have complete lighting control. He doesn’t have to be in room to turn lights on and off. He can get on his phone. It’s voice activation, ask to turn off lights in his home,” said Scott Schaeperkoetter, director of operations for the RISE program, according to KTVI . \nRISE stands for Restoring Independence Supporting Empowerment, according to the Sinise foundation’s website . Its goal is to help “our wounded heroes increase their mobility and reclaim their self-reliance” by “providing specially adapted smart homes, home modifications, mobility devices and adapted vehicles to America’s most severely wounded heroes & their families.” \nThe foundation has built homes for military members, but this will be the first “smart home” built by the foundation for a law enforcement officer.
