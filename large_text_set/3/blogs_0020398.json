If there’s a legitimate way to modify the Constitution, I literally think there should be an amendment to the Constitution for healthcare for chronic illnesses and serious injury,” Cuban said according to Ballasy.

And it’s not a full single-payer approach, what I said was that we all share in the same risk. There’s the genetic lottery risk, right?” Cuban prefaced. \n“All of us have some disease that’s in us that’s going to pop out at some point in our lives. Then we also face the lottery of life risk, where wrong place wrong time. And traditionally in this country when we all have a shared risk that we all face… we all tend to share in the cost as well,” he continued.   \nAccording to Cuban, however, his proposal differs from traditional single-payer healthcare plans by covering a more narrow scope. \n“By creating a single-payer system just for chronic illnesses and for life-threatening illnesses, not everything… and we do some of that with Medicaid and Medicare already,” he said. \nDiscussing the supposed benefits of such reform, Cuban notes that corporations and employer based insurance providers would benefit from lower costs, and families would have to deal with less uncertainty. \n“I think, from a cost perspective, all of a sudden all the corporations that provide healthcare, their costs go down dramatically, so that’s one big benefit. Everybody who has that uncertainty of not knowing if something goes really wrong in their family… that goes away,” he stated.
