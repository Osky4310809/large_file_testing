I’m not going to screenshot that, because I don’t hate you (or myself). \nKeep in mind that few of these headlines refer to the fact that Khan’s travel privileges status hasn’t been confirmed yet. Indeed, given the high profile of someone like Mr. Khan, you would think that someone would at least be willing to confirm anonymously what his travel status was. \nAlso, keep in mind that Mr. Khan is a) an American citizen and b) originally from Pakistan, a nation not on Trump’s immigration ban list. Unless there’s something here we’re not getting, there’s no evidence he should have any travel restrictions. \nAnd yet, nothing. No pictures of a letter from DHS or any other similar authority. No video of him being turned away at the airport. Much like the GPA of one Mr. Blutarsky , Khizr Khan’s level of evidence so far comes out to zero. Point. Zero. \nThat isn’t to say that he might not yet produce something that proves his claims accurate. If it turns out that Khizr Khan’s right to travel has been restricted, that’s a real story. If it was done without reason, that’s an even bigger story, and one for which someone should be held accountable in the strongest possible way — and by that, I mean prison. \nUntil then, this is a bit like me saying that my travel privileges have been suspended because I write for Conservative Tribune. I was traveling to, um, Equatorial Guinea. I was going to give a speech on behalf of this deposed royal prince who I’m helping move $20,000,000 between bank accounts (he’s assured me via email that there’s no risk). And yet, my travel privileges have been placed “under review.” It’s time for a serious rethink of how our country deals with conservative bloggers . \nCover that one, Politico . I’ve given you just as much evidence as Khizr Khan did. Let’s see if I can make your front page, too. \nPlease like and share on Facebook and Twitter with your thoughts on whether this is “fake news.” What do you think about Khizr Khan's cancellation?
