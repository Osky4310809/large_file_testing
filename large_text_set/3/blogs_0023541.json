Duke Basketball on Twitter confirmed Jeter would be transferring following the spring semester. Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski issued a statement regarding Jeter's two years with the program, per the team's official athletic website . \"Chase has been an outstanding young man in our program for the last two years,\" Krzyzewski said. \" He has been one of our top academic performers since he arrived on campus. Unfortunately, he was held back this season due to injury. We wish nothing but the absolute best for Chase and his family.\" Jeter also addressed his decision to transfer from the school: \nI have loved my time at Duke, getting a world-class education and competing alongside my brothers every day. After careful consideration, I decided it would be best for me to transfer to a school closer to home. I've made long-lasting relationships here and I want to thank my teammates and coaches for the support they've given me over the last two years. A verbal commit to Duke back in 2014, Jeter was one of the nation's top prospects coming out of high school in Las Vegas. He was rated as a 5-star prospect and No. 15 overall player by Scout.com . Things didn't materialize for Jeter in two seasons at Duke. He missed the team's last 19 games with a herniated disk in his back and was ineffective with averages of 2.6 points and 2.7 rebounds per game in 16 games before the injury. Because of Jeter's high ceiling coming out of college, he's still got the upside to be an impact player. He just has to prove he can remain healthy enough to reach his full potential at a new school.
