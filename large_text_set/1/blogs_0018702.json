The report suggested that the phone would be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC. Now Nokia China might have just confirmed that a Snapdragon 835-powered Android smartphone is in the pipeline. \nResponding to a user on Weibo, Nokia China has said that a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835-powerd Nokia smartphone is in works, but it will take some time before it gets official. Unfortunately, the brand hasn’t revealed any other details about the upcoming flagship or its name. In another reply to a separate question, the company has asked users to follow it for news on Nokia Windows-powered devices. But this doesn’t necessarily mean new Nokia-branded Windows devices are on their way. \nAs per earlier reports , the Snapdragon 835-powered phone will be called the Nokia 8. It will arrive in a Snapdragon 821 SoC-powered variant as well. The phone is rumoured to offer up to 6GB of RAM, a 24MP rear snapper with OIS and EIS, a 12MP front shooter, dual front-firing speakers and a heart rate sensor. The phone is expected to be unveiled at MWC next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-23T15:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-23T10:38:41.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
