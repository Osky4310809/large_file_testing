were willing’, Richard Painter said  27   US The Queen is set to meet Mr Trump in October Getty Images \nThe former chief ethics counsel to President George W Bush has suggested the Queen pair up with former President Barack Obama to sue Donald Trump over his “libellous” claims that they wiretapped him. \n“Obama could now have a co-plaintiff in a libel suit against Trump,” tweeted Richard Painter, one of the lawyers behind a case which alleges the President has conflicts of interest with his business empire. “If only they were willing.” \nThe current US President held strong that both parties subjected him to illegal surveillance at Trump Tower before the election, despite FBI Director James Comey declaring this week before the House Intelligence Committee that he had no evidence to prove it. NSA director denies GCHQ was asked to spy on Trump Tower \nGCHQ in the UK and Mr Obama’s spokesperson also denied ordering the now President to be put under surveillance. \nDespite highly stringent libel laws in the UK, it would be unlikely for the head of state’s office to launch a lawsuit against the new President. \nMr Trump is scheduled to visit the Queen in October at Buckingham Palace. It was arranged for June but it was delayed following protests in the UK against Mr Trump’s controversial policies.

Critics accused the President of making up the claims to distract attention from the alleged ties between his campaign and Russian operatives before and after the election, which he has denied.
