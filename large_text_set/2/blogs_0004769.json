The one thing that stood out was Anushka Sharma’s ghost avatar. The premise of the film goes that Anushka Sharma’s ghost returns to the real world for some unfinished business. The film stars, Udta Punjab fame Diljit Dosanjh and Life Of Pi fame Suraj Sharma. However, unlike the films in the past where actresses have portrayed a ghost in the film, she is playing a friendly ghost. We’ve already reported how the film has an uncanny resemblance to Johnny Depp’s Corpse Bride. The film is up for a March 24, 2017, release. \nHere we’ll take a look at five other films where Bollywood actresses have played ghosts, not necessarily a friendly one, though. \nKareena Kapoor Khan in Talaash: The Answer Lies Within \nThis was the main twist of the film. In this Aamir Khan starrer thriller, Kareena Kapoor Khan played a ghost all along and was only visible to Aamir Khan’s character. The film was critically acclaimed and did average business at the box office. The film was very dark in nature and Kareena being the ghost was kept under wraps in the film, until the end. \nBipasha Basu in Alone \nBipasha Basu played the role of twin sisters, out of which one was dead. The film starred Bipasha with her real life husband Karan Singh Grover. This horror film was supposed to scare the daylights of the audience but the only one left scared were the producers after the film’s performance at the box office. \nKonkona Sen Sharma in Ek Thi Daayan \nNot exactly a ghost but Konkona Sen Sharma’s turn as the deadly ‘Daayan’ was scary, to say the least. She portrayed the part perfectly. If only the film was nothing but an extended first half. It was in the second half that film lost its plot when Konkona’s character made an exit.

But if you are a huge movie buff, chances are you’ll guess what Isha’s mysterious character is up to. Having said that, it was film’s climax which was the only thing worth remembering. \nSneha Ullal in Click \nClick was the remake of much loved Thai horror Shutter. Not many are aware of the film but once again its climax was a treat. Sneha Ullal played the ghost, which once again, was hidden from the audience for the longest time.
