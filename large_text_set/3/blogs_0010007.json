Beyoncé , who is expecting twins with husband Jay Z , shared a series of stunning baby bump photos on her website on Monday, March 13, and some fans believe the pictures may hold a clue to the sex of her babies. Beyonce's Twin Pregnancy Style \nIn the shots, which were taken the night of her stepfather Richard Larson 's birthday dinner, the 22-time Grammy winner dons a velvet black dress, knee-high suede boots and a honeycomb choker. She accessorized the look with a pair of round, silver earrings, a piece of statement jewelry that set the Beyhive abuzz. Beyonce Courtesy Beyonce \nMany diehard fans noticed that the earrings were the same ones Beyoncé, 35, wore in the music video for her 2008 hit \"If I Were a Boy,\" causing some people to wonder if the singer was trying to send a subtle message about the sex of her soon-to-be little bundles of joy. (And let's be honest, Beyoncé isn't one to repeat accessories, so this theory may not be too far-fetched!) Beyonce's Best Instagram Style \n\"Beyoncé is wearing the If I Were a Boy earrings again... does this mean she's having twin boys??\" one Twitter user wondered, sharing side-by-side photos of the earrings then and now. Another fan took the speculation a step further, tweeting, \"Earrings from If I Were A Boy video, still rocking emerald. Beyoncé is having twin boys and is due in May.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-14T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-14T20:52:28.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
