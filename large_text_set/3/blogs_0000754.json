Or outdated?\nBogden's letter is the first sign that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer wasn't blowing smoke when he promised \"greater enforcement\" of federal marijuana laws at a press conference last week .\nIf attendees follow federal law to the letter, the Las Vegas Cannabis Cup will be quite different from cups past. The event, which has been held in Amsterdam since at least 1988, is one of the cannabis industry's largest gatherings. The \"cup\" aspect is a contest between marijuana strains . The first Cannabis Cup wasn't held stateside until 2010, just after Obama's Justice Department issued the Ogden Memo signalling a more relaxed attitude toward state-legal medical marijuana. (The aforementioned Cole memo was a clarification of the Ogden memo ; the Bogden letter is a rebuttal of Cole; federal marijuana policy is a shell game.)\nFollowing the Reno Gazette-Journal 's report, High Times released a statement today saying that it has worked closely with Nevada agencies, and was, prior to Bogden's letter, \"confident we would have an event that was a safe celebration of cannabis within Nevada's medical cannabis statutes\" and Moapa Tribal Law.\nIn light of Bogden's letter, the magazine says \"vendors, guests, performers and attendees are advised to comply with all local, state, and federal laws regarding the use and distribution of cannabis and cannabis related products.\"\nAs for Bogden , not to be confused with Ogden: He was first appointed U.S. Attorney of Nevada by President George W. Bush, and served six years before joining a private practice in 2007. He was nominated for a second stint by President Barack Obama in 2009.\nI've reached out to High Times for more information.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T01:17:28.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
