Yiannopoulos’ talk was cancelled after demonstrators lit fires, vandalized businesses, and assaulted Donald Trump and Yiannopoulos supporters.\nRefuse Fascism, which includes Princeton professor Cornel West as one of its founding “initiators,” defended the response, issuing a statement on its website that called the shut down “righteous.”\nAnd on its Facebook page , the group asserted that the vandalism and arson were not “violence.” Instead, the group argued that Yiannopoulos and Trump perpetrate violence through the policies they support.\n“Dismantling police fences is not violent. And to compare preventing someone like that from speaking to the real-world violence that they perpetuate everyday is ludicrous,” reads one post on the group’s Facebook page.\nWould it do any good to point out to these brainless twits that the only violence that has resulted from Trump's order came from them? I guess not.\nThe organization did not mention the violent attacks against conservatives. One Trump backer was attacked with shovels by a group of men clad in black. He was shown laying unconscious in the middle of the street. A female Trump supporter was blasted with pepper spray while giving an on-camera interview.\nHow very righteous of them. Of course, if the Trump supporter had died, it would have been justified because they disagreed with his political opinions. In Refuse Fascism's America, opposing them can get you \"righteously\" killed.\nRefuse Fascism’s involvement has spurred questions about who is behind the group. In a series of tweets on Thursday, Trump asserted that the protesters were paid to agitate.\nWhile it is unclear whether those who carried out the violence were paid to do so, the benefactors of the Alliance for Global Justice — and Refuse Fascism — are listed online.\nAccording to its most recent 990 tax form , Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ) received $2.2 million in funding for the fiscal year ending in March 2016.\nOne of the group’s biggest donors is the Tides Foundation, a non-profit funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros. Tides gave AfGJ $50,000.\nOther notable donors include the city of Tucson and the United Steel Workers labor union. The former gave $10,000 to AfGJ while the latter contributed $5,000.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/02/04/soros-funded-group-gave-50k-to-goons-who-provoked-berkley-riot/\nload more", "external_links": ["http://afgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AFGJ-990-2015-Small.pdf", "https://refusefascism.org/2017/02/02/three-points-on-the-righteous-shut-down-of-fascist-milo-yiannopoulos-at-uc-berkeley/", "http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/03/look-who-funds-the-group-behind-the-call-to-arms-at-milos-berkeley-event/", "https://www.facebook.com/RefuseFascism/photos/a.1630703277223682.1073741828.1629925673968109/1651029938524349/?type=3&theater"], "published": "2017-02-04T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:10:36.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
