Natural-looking highlighters are about as out-of-date as Vine (RIP). Now, it's all about otherworldly shades like purple and blue. If you've been meaning to try the trend, these Anastasia Beverly Hills Aurora Glow Kit swatches will have you fully convinced. Like bronze and gold highlighters, the dreamy hues in this kit have the same brightening effect — just with a holographic twist. Several of the shades even change colors depending on how the light hits them. Spectra, for one, looks violet in the pan, but on skin, it shifts to fuchsia and baby blue. It's basically the closest thing you'll get to magic in your beauty routine. To show you just how magical these duochrome highlighters really are, we swatched the Anastasia Beverly Hills Aurora Glow Kit on three different skin tones.

Hannah Choi/ Allure As expected, the formula is intensely pigmented. All you have to do is lightly touch the pan to pick up enough color for at least one cheekbone. This comes in handy for making the highlighters work on all skintones; because they're so intense, the color payoff is pretty accurate no matter the depth of the starting canvas. They're super creamy, too. In the past, I've noticed that some of ABH's highlighters could be on the gritty side because of all that glitter. (Not a complaint, just a fact.) The ones in this palette, however, are finely milled. They still have the same twinkle — fitting seeing as how some of the shades are named after constellations. Of course, colorful (read: none nude or pastel pink) highlighters can seem intimidating and not for everyday use. These pigmented swathes probably won't ease a skeptic's apprehensions. However, the ones in the Aurora Glow Kit are incredibly simple to use, which is great news for novices. Because the colors aren't about having a subtle glow, you don't have to worry about finding a shade that naturally flatters your skin tone. They all do. You just adjust the rest of your makeup with complementary colors to make them work. As for actually applying the powders, you can easily gauge the intensity of the colors by layering on more or less product. The highlighters are also great for mixing and matching. Orion and Spectra, in particular, look intense and cool layered over a champagne highlighter. They act as almost a holographic top coat. You can brush them on your lids as shimmery eye shadows, too. To be fair though, all of the shades can stand alone. When you look at them straight on, they look like any other highlighter — that is glimmery and not like you're ready for your Instagram close-up. The magic comes in when you angle your face. The Anastasia Beverly Hills Aurora Glow Kit will be available April 4th on anastasiabeverlyhills.com .
