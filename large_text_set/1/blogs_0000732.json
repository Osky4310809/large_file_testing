King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 4 hours ago 2 Opeth frontman Mikael Akerfeldt recently gave a lengthy reply on whether there will ever be another Storm Corrosion album, saying the project simply isn't on top of anyone's list of priorities.As you may or may not know, Storm Corrosion is a project by Mikael Akerfeldt and fellow prog giant Steven Wilson. The band was founded in 2010, releasing only one album to date in 2012.Anyhow, Mikael tells Linea Rock : \"There might be a second album, but it's one of those things... That was a labor of love, you could say. Me and Steve, we had talked about writing music together because we had worked together quite a few times - I've been on his records and he's been on our records, of course, but we never actually wrote music together.\"So that's why Storm Corrosion even exists - because both me and him wanted to write together. And it was really fun - it was a fun record to make, and it was so 'real time' that it was scary. We just sat down and I came up with something and he came up with something, and we recorded it, and that was a song. It was done like that.\"Mikael added: \"I know that it can happen again. It's just that it's not the priority. It's something that we did it for fun, basically, and for the love of music. So if we do it again, it will be when we completely - the schedules are empty and there's nothing happening, we have lots of time. And then we're not afraid of failure either. Like, if we try and it doesn't work, it doesn't really matter.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T12:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:10.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
