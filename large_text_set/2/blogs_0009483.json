PUBLISHED: 12:34, Mon, Feb 13, 2017 | UPDATED: 12:46, Mon, Feb 13, 2017 \nWith the House of Lords due to begin debating the Government’s proposed Article 50 Bill next week, the Change Britain group are calling on British voters to ramp up the pressure on peers. \nOpposition members have already tabled a number of amendments to the Article 50 legislation raising fears the Prime Minister’s Brexit timetable could be delayed. \nIf passed, the Article 50 Bill will hand Theresa May the power to formally notify the EU of Britain’s departure, which she has vowed to do by the end of next month. Related articles Liberal Democrat peers to continue bid for second EU referendum \nBoth Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already revealed they will seek to meddle with the Government’s Bill in the House of Lords, having failed in a bid to add conditions to the legislation in the House of Commons last week. \nThe Government does not hold a majority in the House of Lords, meaning the Bill’s passage is likely to prove more complicated when debated by unelected peers. \nBut Change Britain have launched a campaign for peers to be shown the strength of public support for the Government to be allowed to get on with Brexit unencumbered. \nThey have highlighted how peers previously blocked an attempt to get the promise of an EU referendum written into law in 2014. \nMore than 50,000 emails have already been sent to a trio of leading europhile peers , including former Labour leader Lord Neil Kinnock and ex-business secretary Lord Peter Mandelson demanding they vote for the Article 50 Bill unamended. \nThe peers, along with former BBC Trust chair Lord Chris Patten, are also being urged to reveal their EU pensions if they speak in the House of Lords next week. \nAll three previously served as EU commissioners and are estimated to earn tens of thousands each year in pension payments from their Brussels service. \nEU pension holders are required to hold a \"duty of loyalty\" to the bloc. PA Lord Mandelson and Lord Kinnock are being urged to declare their EU pensions in the House of Lords Unelected peers shouldn’t seek to delay this because they refuse to accept the result of the referendum. Tory MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan \nTory MP and Change Britain supporter Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: “This Bill is simply about giving the Prime Minister the authority to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the EU. \n“Nothing more, nothing less. Unelected peers shouldn’t seek to delay this because they refuse to accept the result of the referendum. \n“Many of these Lords are also set to receive generous pensions from the EU. \n“They should declare this so the public know whether they are voting with democracy or their bank account in mind.” What Theresa May's 12-point Brexit plan really means Mon, January 16, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:01:48.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
