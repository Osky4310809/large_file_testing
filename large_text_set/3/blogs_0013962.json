The hosts joked, “Are you sure this isn’t a contestant of ‘High School Rapper’?’ after seeing the photo, which turned out to be one of Yuju’s. \nShe explained that her parents had given her a buzzcut back then so that her hair could regrow more plentifully. \nDo you think you could have guessed each of the members based on these photos?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:43:03.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
