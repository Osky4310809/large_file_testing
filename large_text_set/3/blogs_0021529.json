Credit Annie Leibovitz/Vogue LONDON — Theresa May may be a politician who keeps her cards close to her chest, but she has always been open about her deep love of fashion. Wearing leopard-print shoes, tartan checks, leather jackets and stark pieces of statement jewelry, Mrs. May has consistently pushed the boundaries of conventional attire for female politicians. A pioneer for a new age in power dressing, she has long made a point of defying received wisdom that women should simply imitate the suit-centered uniforms of male leaders — though tweaked with a slightly brighter color palette. In 2014, when interviewed on the BBC Radio program “Desert Island Discs,” she declared that her choice of a desert island luxury item would be a lifetime subscription to Vogue. So it seemed fitting that this week Mrs. May became the first British prime minister to be featured in the American pages of the world’s best-known fashion magazine, taking part in an interview and also a glossy photo shoot by Annie Leibovitz for that magazine’s April edition.

Credit Annie Leibovitz/Vogue Despite an initial speculative frenzy when news of the shoot first broke in January, Mrs. May was not the cover star. Suggestive of the diversified power axes covered by Vogue and those that appeal to its readers, that spot was taken by Selena Gomez, the most followed person on Instagram. And the interview itself held surprises. Mrs. May spoke about a range of topics, such as holding President Trump’s hand (“he was being a gentleman,” she said) and her husband’s prowess in the kitchen (he makes a mean mushroom risotto). She mentioned her penchant for the American crime show “NCIS,” and tackled the constant comparisons between her and the only other female British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “There can only ever be one Margaret Thatcher,” she said stiffly. “I’m Theresa May. I do things my way.” Still, Mrs. May was less punchy when it came to what she wore for the photographs, taken in January at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat. In one shot, strolling in a field with her husband, Philip, she wore a 400-pound (or $498) scarlet coat by Egg, with a custom cashmere sweater from Sine by Egg and a pair of her own knee-high patent leather boots by Russell & Bromley. In another, sitting on a plush green sofa and cupping her face with one hand (sporting bright fuchsia nails), she wore a navy dress (£225, or $280) and matching coat (£425, or $529) by the British workwear label LK Bennett, the perennial provider of nude pumps to the Duchess of Cambridge.
