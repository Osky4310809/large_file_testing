The idea here is to give users a different way to explore Google, instead of requiring the entry of a voice or text search query. \nAs the company explains in its announcement of the new design, “the Google search box is great when you’re looking for a specific answer, but there are also moments when you just want to catch up on the latest for topics of interest.” \nThe shortcuts appear at the top of the Google app or mobile site just below the search box. For example, there are shortcuts that take you to the weather, to sports or entertainment news, where you can do things like catch up on scores, watch trailers, read reviews, see what’s playing nearby, and more. Other shortcuts will help you find places to eat. \nIf you tap the arrow to the right of the main shortcuts on Android, you’re taken to a whole page filled with the tappable icons, which are organized into categories like Nearby, Lifestyle, Tools, Fun, Weather, Travel, and My Stuff – the latter which is a personalized section that will pop you into your own emails, events, flights or hotels. \nFrom here, Android users will be able to do things like access Google Translate, look up nearby attractions, find flights or hotels, do an internet speed test, convert currency, or even play games like tic-tac-toe, roll a die, animal sounds or solitaire. Google threw in the “I’m Feeling Curious” search option as a shortcut, too, because why not? eatanddrink", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:43:53.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
