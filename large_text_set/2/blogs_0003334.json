Jones , USA TODAY Sports 2:19 p.m. ET Feb. 3, 2017 CLOSE x Share USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero breaks down what to look out for from Houston as the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons prepare for Super Bowl LI. USA TODAY Sports Falcons WR Julio Jones has long been QB Matt Ryan's (2) favorite target. (Photo: Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — The next time Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones begs his head coach for the ball, it will be the first in their two years together. \nDan Quinn said he could remember just one instance since coming to the Falcons in 2015 that Jones even approached him about getting the ball more. And even then, it was a suggestion — posed in the form of a question — based on something he was seeing from the defense. \nJones might be the Falcons’ best player and biggest star, but he’s in no way the team’s diva. \n\"None of those things you might associate with a name type player,” Quinn said recently. \nMORE SUPER BOWL COVERAGE \nThe closest thing Jones gets to boastful seemed to come Wednesday, when asked directly if he thinks anyone in the NFL could cover him one on one. \n“I do not,” he replied. \nThroughout Super Bowl week, teammates and coaches have described Jones as humble and hard working, detailing the practice habits of a generous teammate who wants others to excel. \n“He’s not a selfish guy at all. He likes for the ball to be spread around so everyone can get their touches — which is smart, because you don’t want to demand the ball all the time — so now you’re drawing everybody to you. You want the ball to be spread out, so that in turn you can get open yourself,” veteran receiver Eric Weems told USA TODAY Sports. \nIt’s an attitude that could help the Falcons in Super Bowl LI should the New England Patriots’ game plan be focused on finding a way to try to eliminate Jones. If he isn’t demanding the ball when coverage tells quarterback Matt Ryan to throw it elsewhere, other Falcons can shine. \n“We understand people are going to take me away, because I’m a threat,” Jones said. “But we have so many weapons on the offensive side of the ball. I mean, they see it on film. They're going to do what they can, and they're going to make guys step up and make plays, and then make in-game adjustments. But probably coming out, they might try to take me away.” \nWhat Jones and the Falcons are hoping to find is that with so much attention on him, other receivers like Mohammed Sanu and Taylor Gabriel, will win their one-on-one battles, or running backs Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman will find space. That’s the way Atlanta beat the Denver Broncos earlier this year, when Aqib Talib held Jones to just two catches for 29 yards. \nMORE FALCONS COVERAGE Falcons DT Grady Jarrett hopes to win ring that eluded his dad, Jessie Tuggle \nBut the Falcons are also counting on Jones to win the matchup against New England’s top corner, Malcolm Butler, and like their chances even when Jones draws two defenders. In two games against the Seattle Seahawks this year, when he was primarily covered by Pro Bowl corner Richard Sherman, Jones had 13 catches for 206 yards and two touchdowns. \n“He’s a nightmare to game plan for, no doubt about it,” Falcons wide receivers coach Raheem Morris told USA TODAY Sports. \nAnd Morris would know. He was head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when the Falcons drafted Jones in 2011. In two games that year against Morris’ Bucs, with corners Talib and Ronde Barber among the players on Tampa Bay's defense, the rookiehad 10 catches for 191 yards and two touchdowns. \nNow a two-time all-pro and four-time Pro Bowler, Jones only seems to be getting better, leading the NFL in receiving yards per game each of the past two seasons. He returned to practice this week after taking it easy in Georgia after the NFC title game because of a toe injury. He's spent extra time watching how the Patriots have defended opposing No. 1 receiver in hopes of getting a better idea of what might happen Sunday. \n“It takes a team to win a game. I can play really well individually, but I can’t win the game by myself,” Jones said. “It’s a team effort. I’m doing my job. If I’m taking two guys away on that play, I’m doing my job.” \n*** \nFollow Lindsay H. Jones on Twitter @bylindsayhjones \nPHOTOS: Falcons' road to Super Bowl LI Facebook Posted!
