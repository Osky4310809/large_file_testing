Drawing has become a therapeutic outlet for Aswad who is also pressing Colorado legislation to allow victims to break free from their lease to distance themselves from further threats. \nMichelle Aswad stood at her apartment door, key trembling in her hand. She took a deep breath, turned the handle and waited for the terror to begin, again. \nFor days, Aswad had relived the sexual assault she endured at the hands of an ex-boyfriend in her downtown Denver apartment. \n“I simply dreaded going home, and then being there,” the 36-year-old said of the assault four years ago. “And then I was too terrified to leave once I was inside.” \nAswad asked her apartment manager about breaking her lease. Her assailant, she explained, knew her home, knew her life patterns, knew her. But the answer was no. \n“It wasn't a very secure building; he was always getting in the front door behind other people,” Aswad said. “I'd hear the elevator ding and it sent me spiraling.” \nAswad is among a group of sexual assault victims who advocates say are victimized daily by familiar surroundings that not only carry the memories of their lives, but the horrors of their attacks. Except for victims of domestic abuse — people who share a domicile — those who are sexually assaulted or targets of stalking are bound by their leases regardless of the dangers they might face. \nRep. Dominique Jackson, an Aurora Democrat, is sponsoring a bill that would allow such victims to break their leases under certain circumstances. HB 17-1035 has passed the full House and heads to the Senate Judiciary Committee for hearings Wednesday. Advertisement \n“The victims are deeper than just those in a relationship,” Jackson said. “You don't hear from those victimized by their caregivers, or others who are highly regarded or hold positions of power. You don't hear about the victimization by the landlords themselves.” \nNo room to move \nAswad said she was stunned that her apartment manager would not let her out of the lease. \n“She said there was nothing she could do for me. If I broke the lease, I would be responsible for the six or seven months left,” Aswad recalled. “At more than $800 a month, and the loss of a security deposit, I couldn't afford that.” \nHaving just come out of minor surgery — which had been aggravated by the assault — and subsisting on a $15-an-hour, part-time job while working on an undergraduate degree, Aswad understood her financial prospects were bleak. \nAnother week of sleepless nights on the living room floor passed before Aswad tried again. “I couldn't bear to be in my own bedroom, to touch anything he had touched,” she said. \nShe asked the landlord if she could move to another apartment in the building, but got the same answer. It would cost money to clean up the apartment and ready it for re-renting. Andy Cross, The Denver Post Artist Michelle Aswad, a sexual assault victim, puts final touches on her pencil drawing of Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado at her home March 07, 2017. The drawing was started after her assault and is a therapeutic an outlet for her. Aswad and other sexual assault victims and stalking victims are pressing Colorado legislation to allow victims to break free from their lease to distance themselves from further threats. \nDocuments required \nTo protect against potential fraud, Jackson's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. John Cooke, R-Greeley, requires that anyone seeking to break their lease provide one of three documents: a police report or protection order; a statement from a medical professional confirming the victim's status; or a statement from the state's address confidentiality program that the victim has applied for help. \nAttorney Deborah Wilson, a member of the Apartment Association of Metro Denver who also represents landlords, told legislators she supported the measure in theory but had concerns about potential abuse. \n“As drafted, it incentivizes people to make false claims to try to get out of their lease,” she testified. “The threshold for proof is very low, where someone can go to a doctor and make a self-serving statement … and I can see a lot of people doing that.” \nCommittee vice chairman Rep. Joe Salazar, D-Thornton, bristled. \n“Would you rather a victim wait to suffer an assault before you take action, and if so, would you be willing to accept all the liability of that?” he asked Wilson. “Or break their lease and (allow them to) move to a safer place? … The vacancy rate is 5.4 percent in the Denver metro area, so it doesn't seem like landlords are having a hard time finding new tenants.” \nThere are no hard numbers of how many sexual assault victims are turned away by landlords refusing to break a lease, Jackson admits, nor those locked behind their own apartment doors fearful of the person stalking them. \nEven with a police report, the law is largely on the landlord's side. \n“If they feel at risk, they are less likely to engage in the legal process because they don't feel like the system is doing anything for them now,” Denver Deputy District Attorney Allison Rocker told legislators during a hearing Feb. 7. \nA hostage at home \nAswad had difficulty handling even the most mundane of tasks in her apartment. She associated nearly everything with her assailant, with the attack. \n“I had to get rid of everything, right down to the dishes, the silverware, the pots and pans, anything he could have used or touched, gone,” she said. “I was stuck, a hostage and had no way out.” \nHer assailant worked a plea agreement in the courts for probation that included an ankle monitor. What happened next shook Aswad to her core. \n“They found out he had been coming by places I frequented, including my home,” she said. “I nearly suffocated.” \nAssaults not reported \nNearly two-thirds of all sexual assaults are never reported, Raana Simmons, policy director for the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault, told legislators during hearings on the bill. And in a survey of advocates, Simmons said, 88 percent said they had counseled victims who needed to move but could not. \nIn some cases in which tenants were sexually assaulted by their landlord, subsequent requests to have locks changed were ignored, Simmons said. \nThe number of sex-crime felonies in Colorado has risen slightly, from 1,679 in 2015 to 1,714 in 2016, according to the state's annual judicial report. Advocates say the numbers would be higher but for unreported assaults. \nStalking crimes are even harder to pursue, said Rocker, the deputy DA. In Denver, just 15 nondomestic-violence stalking cases were filed in 2015. In 2016, there were 18. \n“It is incredibly difficult to build stalking cases, usually months or years,” Rocker testified. “Victims are often counted on to gather their own evidence. It is unique among crimes.” \nOne victim, identified only as “S.H.” to legislators, testified at the House judiciary committee hearing of how she stopped reporting stalking incidents to police, but not out of concern they weren't responding. \n“The stalking incidents became increasingly alarming and I was terrified every single day,” the woman testified. “I learned of the nuisance clause in my lease and the threat of being evicted for making too many calls to the police. Having an eviction or breaking your lease is almost always an automatic denial for future housing.” \nThe financial impact of breaking a lease can be devastating, and for some, particularly students, the costs could be prohibitive. \n“If we don't allow students the flexibility of getting out of these leases, they're more likely to fail or drop out,” said Kylie Mallory-Halter, a campus-based victim's advocate at Metropolitan State University of Denver. \n“ At least change the lock” \nAswad approached her building manager a third time. “At least change the lock,” she said. “It was the same answer.” \nThe housing market was getting so tight, so difficult to locate an affordable apartment that Aswad said she gave up pressing to move. \nHer assailant was eventually imprisoned for violating the terms of his probation and sits in a state penitentiary. Aswad is seeing a therapist and lives in a new apartment, but it shouldn't have taken three years, she said. \n“Others are facing these problems every day,” she said. “It shouldn't be a struggle.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-13T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-13T18:44:14.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
