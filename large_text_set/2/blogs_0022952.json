Stuart Black/Getty Images. Benaulim \nBenaulim Beach is only a short distance south of Colva Beach, but there's a huge contrast between the two. Known for its fishing industry, it's a beautiful and laid back stretch of beach. You won't find any wild parties there, but water sports and dolphin sightseeing trips are on offer. It does get a little crowded around peak time in December, but head a bit further south down the beach and the quietness will be restored. Restaurants line the main stretch of beach but most of the accommodations are set back from the beach, along with art galleries and shops. It attracts a lot of retirees. Location: South Goa, 8 kilometers (5 miles) from Marago and 41 kilometers (25 miles) from Panaji. The closest railway station is Marago. Candolim Beach, Goa. Greg Elms/Getty Images Candolim and Sinquerim \nThe long straight stretch of Candolim Beach is lined with shacks and bars, which back onto scrub covered sand dunes. It's a lively beach that has managed to retain its cleanliness, and even peacefulness in some areas, making it a good alternative to the maddeningly crowded Calangute and Baga nearby. You'll find plenty of tasty restaurants and happening nightspots in the area. Candolim Beach joins smaller and quieter Sinquerim Beach to the south, which is where you'll find Aguada Fort. Location: North Goa, 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Mapusa and 13 kilometers (8 miles) from Panaji. The closest railway station is Thivim. Colva Church, Goa. Lonely Planet/Getty Images Colva \nBusy Colva Beach is a favorite among domestic Indian tourists, and day-trippers arrive by the bus loads. On the weekend, the crowd explodes with locals as well. The beach also gets particularly busy in October, when hoards of pilgrims come and visit Colva Church. The area is well developed with plenty of budget hotels, beach shacks, food stalls, and small restaurants and bars. The development hasn't however extended to nightlife, which is minimal apart from a few places. Overall, this beach really doesn't have much to offer foreigners compared to other beaches in Goa. Location: South Goa, 8 kilometers (5 miles) from Marago and 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Panaji. The closest railway station is Marago. Morjim Beach, Goa. Nick Laing/Getty Images Mandrem, Morjim, and Ashwem \nThese wide open beaches have become quite hip and trendy in recent years. Groovy beach bars and beach huts, as well as a few fashionable resorts can be found there. The area also has a number of yoga retreats. The beaches are renowned for their protected turtle population. Quite a bit of land in the area around Morjim and Ashwem has been bought by Russians, who have settled there en mass . It's possible to walk to Mandrem from Arambol.
