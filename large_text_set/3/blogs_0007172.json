He says it was being displayed on an eye level shelf, not far from the children's section.\nPuia claims he asked an employee to move the display to higher shelves, but 3 days later he returned and it was in the same spot. That's when he decided to go back and destroy the books with red liquid.\nThe 74-year-old says he's no holy roller, he just believes kids shouldn't be exposed to smut ... regardless of what celeb is behind it. Puia says he only turned himself in because he got a call from police saying a warrant was out for his arrest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T02:21:53.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
