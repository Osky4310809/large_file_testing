Soon after, the semi-finalists were named and went on to compete in swimwear, evening gown, final question and final look.

Did they bring back the guy from last year?'\" he joked. \"When you make a mistake you just have to keep moving forward.\" \nUltimately, there were no problems from the host as he helped the show go off without a hitch. \nFlo Rida and Boys ll Men performed as Ashley Graham served as Backstage Host.
