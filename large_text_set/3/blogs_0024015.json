The moment will be freighted with significance: exactly 60 years earlier, as expectant crowds huddled under umbrellas on the Piazza del Campidoglio outside, plenipotentiaries from six Western European countries—France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg—assembled in the same room to sign the Treaty of Rome. The 1957 treaty established the institutions that made up the European Economic Community—the European Commission, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice (ECJ)—which was in time to become the EU. (A second treaty signed that day created the European Atomic Energy Community, later folded into the EU.) What was the significance of the Treaty of Rome? The treaty emerged from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), signed by the six countries in Paris in 1951, with the ashes from the second world war still smouldering. By uniting industrial production under a centralised authority the ECSC was, in the words of Robert Schuman, France’s foreign minister, designed to make war “not only unthinkable but materially impossible”. It was also intended to pave the way for much deeper forms of integration between the six countries. There were bumps along the way: in 1954 opposition from French MPs killed a proposed European Defence Community, after which the governments focused their efforts on economics and trade. At a conference in Messina, Sicily, in 1955, the six governments agreed to establish a European customs union and common market. A subsequent report by Paul-Henri Spaak, a Belgian politician, provided the roadmap. This created the foundations for the Treaty of Rome.
