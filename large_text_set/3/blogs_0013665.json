Goalscorers Georginio Wijnaldum and Emre Can were thrilled with Liverpool's comeback victory over Burnley. \nLIVERPOOL -- Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool are in talks with Emre Can and his representatives over a new contract, insisting that negotiations have not stalled. \nCan will enter the final 12 months of his current deal this summer but is yet to commit his long-term future to the Merseyside club. \nRecent reports said contract negotiations between the midfielder's agent and Liverpool had halted as a result of wage demands that the club were unprepared to meet. \nHowever, the midfielder was adamant earlier this week that the delay in penning a new deal was not down to money . \n\"It actually makes no sense to talk about it, but because I obviously heard there was a story out there... yes, we are in talks, what can I say?\" Klopp said at news conference on Friday afternoon when asked about Can's contract situation. \n\"They are good, because Emre likes to be here. We really like him as a person and as a player. So there are talks, there is nothing else to say. \n\"And until the final year starts -- there are a few months still -- no problems, absolutely no problems. \n\"Completely good talks [have been] held with a lot of other players, and if there is something to say about [it] we will be the first.\" \nGlenn is ESPN FC's Liverpool correspondent.
