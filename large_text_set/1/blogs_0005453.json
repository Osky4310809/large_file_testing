In case you forgot, it’s that oh-so-special time of year again. No, we don’t mean the time for new resolutions, or gym memberships, or mercury-in-retrograde panic. WE MEAN GIRL SCOUT COOKIES! And as if that wasn’t enough to lift your spirits, then don’t worry, because we have more good news: The Girl Scouts have added two new cookie flavors to their delectable roster, and life is looking up!\nAccording to Mashable, both new cookies are s’more-themed , but they’ll be sold in different parts of the country because the organization will be using two different bakeries and distributors (meaning you’ll probably only be able to get your hands on ONE of the two).\nThe first new treat is described as a, “crispy graham cookie double dipped in a crème icing and enrobed in a chocolatey coating,” and the second one is a, “crunchy graham sandwich cookie with a chocolate and marshmallowy filling.” HOW CAN WE GET OUR HANDS ON THEM BOTH?!\nvia GIPHY  \nAccording to the Girl Scouts website, these boxes of s’more goodness are in honor of the Scout’s 100th anniversary of cookie-selling . And to this we say, HALLELUJAH!\nAnd don’t worry — if you’re a cookie traditionalist, all your favorite usual cookie flavors will of course also be available. We’re talking Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoas, Do-si-dos — the whole shebang.\nvia GIPHY  \nSo find yourself the nearest Girl Scout and PLACE THOSE ORDERS PEOPLE! You can go here to find the closest selling-site near you. And 100% of proceeds go to support the Girl Scouts in your area…which means you’re also supporting your access to these cookies year after year.\nThat’s a WIN-WIN if we ever heard one!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T07:10:18.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
