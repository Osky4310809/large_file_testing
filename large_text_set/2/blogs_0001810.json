Both players completed the chest pass on the first attempt, but Towns was able to make his three-pointer on the fourth try before IT4 could get his shot off.\nThis year we will have a new champ from the group of Joel Embiid , Kristaps Porzingis , Gordon Hawyard, Anthony Davis, and John Wall who will make his third appearance. The challenge will feature four guards and four forwards which was introduced in 2016.\nThe Skills Challenge is part of an All-Star Saturday night that also includes the Three-Point Contest and the Verizon Slam Dunk Contest. Last year, it featured (Thomas, C.J. McCollum , Jordan Clarkson and Emmanuel Mudiay ) and (Towns, Draymond Green , Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins).\nRockets guard Patrick Beverley won in 2015, while Damian Lillard and Trey Burke both won in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:17:58.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
