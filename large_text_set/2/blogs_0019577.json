Chuck Schumer with Joshua and Mindy Schreiber at a news conference in front of their Seaford home on Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017, where Schumer said that eliminating federal tax deductions for mortgage interest would hurt Long Island homeowners. Photo Credit: Howard Schnapp \n  \nLong Island homeowners would be hit by “tax jeopardy” if federal tax deductions for mortgage interest get reduced or eliminated, as the nation’s new Treasury secretary and some members of Congress have proposed, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at a news conference Tuesday. \nScaling back those deductions “would hurt Long Island particularly hard, because we all know living on Long Island doesn’t come cheap,” and it would discourage young people from buying homes in the region, Schumer said, standing outside the home of Mindy and Joshua Schreiber, who purchased their three-bedroom house in Seaford last month.
