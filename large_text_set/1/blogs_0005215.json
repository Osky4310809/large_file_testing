Devils send Krzyzewski off in style. Randal Kennedy Wednesday at 6:19 PM Allen, Duke bury Jackets under an avalanche of three pointers. \nDURHAM - Grayson Allen scored 15 points and Jayson Tatum added 19 as Duke bested the Yellow Jackets 110-57 in Mike Krzyzewki's final game before back surgery that will sideline him for at least a month. \nDuke took control early using a 29-7 run that propelled them to a 31 point lead at halftime. The margin ballooned to 44 on a layup by Tatum with 8:32 left. The Blue Devils had seven double figure scorers for the first time since the 2007-08 season opener. \nJoining Allen in the starting lineup for the first time was freshman Harry Giles who scored the first double double of his young career. They sent Krzyzewski off on a high note as focus narrows on the conference schedule ahead. \nThe loss snaps Tech's three-game win streak, which included an upset of North Carolina. \nThe Blue Devils quickly erased an early 4-0 deficit behind a season high 16 3-pointers. \nDuke shot 56% as a team including 51% from deep. Georgia Tech managed just 2 3-pointers on 35% shooting. \nUp next, Capels first game in charge Satrurday against the Boston College Eagles.
