I am not saying panic buy. \n“I am talking about in terms of numbers, Liverpool needed something. If you look at their bench, they haven’t got anything like what Manchester United have got, the teams they are trying to compete with. \n“The fact that they haven’t reinforced from a position of strength – where they were in the league as the best challengers for Chelsea – has meant they have fallen away. They don’t have the squad to match the other teams.” Firmino and co. have fallen off the pace in 2017 (Photo: Andrew Powell) \nHamann went even further, suggesting Liverpool were wrong to give manager Jurgen Klopp a six-year contract in the summer, but pointing the finger at the owners, saying: \n“I don’t think they’ve been smart in the transfer market. If you don’t fancy the left back you need to sign a new left back. The goalkeeper situation, that hasn’t worked. \n“My biggest worry with Liverpool is they are too soft in midfield. I watched them against Chelsea who had two proper holding midfielders in Kante and Matip; in Liverpool I don’t see enough purpose and structure, and this is why they are in the position they are at the moment.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:59:15.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
