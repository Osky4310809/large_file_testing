It is unclear if she has entered a plea.\nTalbott was reported missing by her fiancé on March 8, and was later found in a church, bloody and wearing only a shirt, bra and underwear. She claimed to police that “three black males” who wore ski masks had abducted her from her apartment and raped her. There were visible cuts and scratches on her body, according to the release.\n“Almost immediately, Talbott’s story and allegations began to unravel,” Denison Police Chief Jay Burch said in a statement. “Within only a day or two, detectives had doubts as to most of Talbott’s allegations.”\nPolice believe the crime scene — from the alleged kidnapping scene to the church where she was found — was staged and that Talbott admitted that her injuries were self-inflicted.\nThe release states medical personnel who examined the teen were not able to corroborate that she had been sexually assaulted.\nIt is unclear what prompted Talbott to admit to the hoax.\nPolice are closing the investigation and the police department said it will seek restitution for costs incurred while investigating the case.\nThe Denison Police Department stated that the teen’s false claims were “insulting to our community and especially offensive to the African-American community” because of her description of her alleged suspects.\n“The anger and hurts caused from such a hoax are difficult and all so unnecessary,” the department wrote.\n\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T05:22:50.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
