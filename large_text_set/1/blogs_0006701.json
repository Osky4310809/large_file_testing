Temperatures are expected to plunge below freezing for the rest of the week.\n“What we see this week are the coldest temperatures this winter so far,” said Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment Canada.\nSitting at 2 C on Wednesday morning, temperatures will drop to -5 C this afternoon, feeling closer to -15 C, with wind speeds carrying the arctic air up to 60 km/h.\n“The remainder of the week will be chilly as the cold arctic air moves over the city,” Phillips said.\nArticle Continued Below Other than a 30 percent chance of flurries on Wednesday and Thursday, the city will be seeing mix of sun and cloud for the rest of the week.\n“Although the weather doesn’t look like winter, it sure will feel like it,” Phillips said.\nThursday’s day-time high is -5 C. Nighttime temperatures will be at a low of -11 C but will feel like -14 C.\nFriday also carries the frigid pattern, with temperatures as low as -11 C.\nThere’s no reprieve from the cold for the weekend, either: the chill is expected to last until at least Monday.\nTuesday’s temperature was an exceptional seasonal high of around 4 C. The average high for the beginning of January is -1 C, and the average low  -9 C.\n“The temperatures on Tuesday (were) 7 C warmer than they should be for this time of year,” said Phillips.\nWith files from Fakiha Baig \nThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Delivered daily to your inbox.
