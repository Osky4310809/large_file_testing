According to the network, the sixth individual is actually the son of one of the five robbers. Of those arrested, several are well known by French authorities for previous crimes, including cocaine and counterfeit trafficking as well as diamond theft. In total, 14 people remain in custody as of Wednesday. Among those is a man named Gary M., 27, who was reportedly Kardashian West’s chauffeur in the past . His brother Michael, 40, who was reportedly Kardashian West’s driver throughout Paris Fashion Week, was released Tuesday night and is not being charged. Additionally, two of the suspects, Aomar A-K. and Marceau B., reportedly traveled to Antwerp, Belgium a few days after the heist — a city largely known as the diamond capital of the world. However, the stolen jewels, which are valued at around €9 million, have not been located. \nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Is‘Relieved’ Paris Investigation Is Progressing — But ‘Updates Make Her Relive’ Robbery, Says Source \nMeanwhile, a source told PEOPLE on Tuesday that while Kardashian West — who officially stepped back into the spotlight after taking a hiatus from the public eye and social media following the incident — is “relieved” that Paris investigators are making progress in the case, the constant reminder of the terrifying incident hasn’t been easy on her. \n“Any updates makes her relive everything,” said the insider. “It’s still very tough for her to deal with.” \nThe source tells PEOPLE that while she’s thankful that progress has been made by authorities, “she gets very upset anytime she talks about the robbery” and “just wants to move on from it.” \nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 36, is expected to make her first public appearance since the robbery on Friday at celebrity makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic’s Master Class in Dubai.
