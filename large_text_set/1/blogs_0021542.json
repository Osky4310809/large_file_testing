He was 77.\nHurt’s agent Charles McDonald says the actor, who battled pancreatic cancer, died Friday in London.\nThe actor received Academy Award nominations for playing a heroin addict in “Midnight Express” and the tortured John Merrick in David Lynch’s “The Elephant Man.” Hurt had a career that spanned over 50 years in television, film and voice work. He terrified audiences in “Alien,” and spoofed that very same scene in “Spaceballs.”\nHurt appeared in the 2013 Doctor Who 50th anniversary special portraying the War Doctor, a character bridging the older incarnation of the show and its 2005 revival.\nAs prolific as ever, Hurt recently appeared alongside Natalie Portman in the Oscar-nominated film “Jackie” as a priest who consoles the recently widowed first lady. Hurt leaves behind a few production credits, including Joe Wright’s “Darkest Hour, where Hurt plays Neville Chamberlain.\n \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-28T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-28T06:06:27.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
