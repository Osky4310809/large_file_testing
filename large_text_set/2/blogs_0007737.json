TE Xavier Grimble has signed 1-year deal. NFL minimum is $540,000.\n— Joe Rutter (@tribjoerutter) February 7, 2017 \nRelated: Steelers finish outside Final 4 in USA TODAY Sports power rankings \nThe emergence of Xavier Grimble as a viable option at tight end was something of a surprise this season. While his snaps were limited, the former undrafted free agent and practice squad product was a reliable target when given a chance to take the field. Grimble ended the year with 11 receptions for 118-yards and two touchdowns.\nAs an ERFA, Grimble will have signed a one-year deal worth $540,000 and will become a restricted free agent next year. Given Jesse James and Ladarius Green are already under contract, the Steelers will return with their top three tight end’s from 2017 into training camp and potentially another season together.\nWith this latest signing, the Steelers have six ERFA’s still unsigned as of Tuesday and will likely have most of the remaining players under contract in the coming days. The outstanding names include OT Alejandro Villanueva, OLB Anthony Chickillo, C B.J. Finney, OG Cole Manhart, C Valerian Ume-Ezeoke, and ILB Kevin Anderson.\nRelated: Salary cap implications for Steelers after Justin Gilbert release ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:28:18.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
