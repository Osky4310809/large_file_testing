But they’re also a wake-up call.\n“They make me take a quick inventory of my life and say: ‘OK, Kassal, has your life been a good one? Have you made a contribution?’ ”\nHe certainly doesn’t have to look far for the answer. Among hundreds of other achievements, he introduced and helped enact the first law in the US that codified the New York Arts Council in 1960 and was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 2009 for his four years’ service as one of the highest-ranking intelligence officers in WWII.\nSpeaking from his office, which is adorned with photos of himself with the likes of John F. Kennedy Jr., he says: “I’m looking forward to what the next few years hold for me, and hope I’ll continue to make more contributions.”\nConstantine Paspalas Stefano Giovannini Working in a Murray Hill building packed with millennials “keeps me young,” says 79-year-old Manhattan doorman Constantine Paspalas.\nThe divorced dad of two gets the early morning bus into Penn Station five days a week from his home in Hamilton, NJ, to start his workday at 6:30 a.m. It ends at 2:30 p.m.\n“The apartment building is full of young people and I think their youthful outlook reflects on me,” says Paspalas of the 300-unit tower on 33rd Street where he has worked for 19 years. The residents affectionately call him Gus because they can’t pronounce Constantine. He doesn’t mind. “I go along with the crowd,” he says, with a laugh.\nRose Harrison Tamara Beckwith Retirement doesn’t suit Rose Harrison, who tried to stop working in 1992 and didn’t enjoy it.\n“I felt like there was nothing out there for me,” says the 89-year-old divorcée who has worked in education for decades, starting in 1958 with a 42-strong classroom of second-graders. “And then my friends and my doctors suggested I go back to work.”\nIt’s absolutely enlivened me and keeps my neurons firing.\nShe came out of retirement in 1997, taking a job at Hunter College. Five years later, she started teaching at Pace University, where she’s now an adjunct professor who instructs undergraduate and graduate student teachers in educational psychology and early literacy.\n“It’s absolutely enlivened me and keeps my neurons firing,” says Harrison, who lives near Lincoln Center and commutes to work downtown via subway. “There’s no time to relax and I feel smarter now than I’ve ever been.”\nJudy Uman Stephen Yang Working full time can sometimes keep Judy Uman from seeing her five grandchildren as much as she’d like, but she’s otherwise delighted to be so involved in her job.\nThe 78-year-old director of social services for the nonprofit Bronx Jewish Community Council has worked for the organization for 31 years and shows no sign of slowing down.\n“I make sure I keep at the top of my game,” says Uman, who commutes to the borough from her home in Irvington, NY, and primarily works with elderly clients. “You’re always thinking how to make things better for people.”\nShe has no plans for retirement and will continue to work as long as she can.\n“You can sit back and read the newspaper and witness what’s happening in the world from a distance,” she says. “Or you can really have an impact on someone’s life.”\nAbby Popper Stefano Giovannini At 79, Abby Popper is clearly decades older than most of her colleagues at the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, NY, but she has no intention of leaving anytime soon.\n“People ask, ‘When are you going to retire?’ I think it’s because they want my job,” she says, with a laugh.\nThe mother of three grown children, Popper took a job at the film center in 2001. It was a second career of sorts, after 20 years of working in Westchester County government in marketing and public relations.\nPeople ask, ‘When are you going to retire?’ I think it’s because they want my job.\nNow, as a consultant for Jacob Burns, she uses her p.r. skills to promote speaking events, receptions and photography exhibits.\n“I absolutely lucked out with this job,” says Popper, who lives in Rye, NY, and studied business at NYU. “It’s a plum thing.”\nSure, while her friends are sunbathing in Florida, Popper’s driving 25 minutes each way to work, some nights returning home after 11 p.m.\nBut she’s not complaining. “I do go to Florida, but not terribly often,” she says. “It’s too fun up here, with all our speakers, celebrities and special events.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:15:12.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
