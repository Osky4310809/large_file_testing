In one Economic Times graphic last year, the pair were in a souped-up autorickshaw and in a Times of India graphic, they were riding a tortoise.\nThe Economic Times continued its tradition of bombastic graphics Thursday. The paper went with a military theme, variously showing Mr. Modi and Mr. Jaitley aiming assault-style rifles , Prime Minister Modi wearing a helmet and peeking out of a dugout and a risqué image of him wearing little more than a helmet and leather jacket.\nIn other newspapers this year, things were a little more measured. The Hindustan Times cut Mr. Modi’s face with Mr. Jaitley’s next to the headline “Safe Budget Hikes Rural, Infra Spend.” The budget focused on perks for farmers and boosting growth by spending on infrastructure.\nENLARGE The cover of the Hindustan Times, Feb. 2, 2017.
