A new update to the Android app that’s rolling out will allow any notes to be shared without leaving the Evernote app itself.\nSee also: Best note taking apps for Android August 7, 2016 If you have a note that you want to show someone else, you can now open it in Evernote and then tap the share button, which is the three connected dots logo on the top right of the app. After that, you then tap “Share” or the white chain link button. You can share the note via email, your favorite messaging app or even on Slack, again with no need to open up those apps separately.\nIn addition, the Evernote Android app now has a “Shared” section, where you can quickly check out all of the notes that you have shared with others, in case you need to refer to them again. Finally, the app update includes a way to share notebooks of content with others. This can come in handy for a group meeting so they can see everything that’s being discussed, or if a family or group is taking a trip and want to have access to a shared itinerary and more. Evernote says that others can add their own files to the shared notebook, along with adding any of their own notes or comments.\nGet it at Google Play Store ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T03:10:22.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
