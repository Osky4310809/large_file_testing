Early in the morning, the housemates wake up to the song Saajan ji ghar aae wondering what Bigg Boss is hinting at. Manu Punjabi is seen having a conversation with Mona about the nominations task and in retrospect, he says that they all could have destroyed their gifts and become safe from nominations. Manu further adds that everyone including Mona took a hasty decision and did not pay attention to what he was saying. Mona says that sometimes we need to put emotions above everything and think sensibly. \nAs the day progresses, Bigg Boss gives the housemates an opportunity to do luxury budget shopping. In the garden area, the luxury budget items are placed on a table with a plastic string attached to it. The housemates are asked to form a chain and pass on the luxury budget items of their choice by holding it with their mouth. While the housemates were entitled to get 10 minutes for the process, they only get 6 mins because of Manveer Gurjar and Lopamudra Raut’s slip ups. Apart from this, Bigg Boss also lifts the ban imposed on Manu to not use the luxury budget items. The housemates successfully pick up some of their favourite luxury budget items and feel delighted. \nLater in the day, Bigg Boss calls for Mona and asks her to go inside the activity area. Mona gets extremely excited and enters the activity area to find her boyfriend Vikrant standing there waiting for her against a brightly lit romantic backdrop. Mona runs towards him and greets him with a tight hug. When Mona asks him the reason for his visit, he simply goes down on his knees, takes out a sparkling ring and proposes her for marriage. Mona is over the moon and finds it all surreal. Vikrant further tells her that they are going to get married right there, inside the Bigg Boss house in everybody’s presence and Mona jumps with job unable to contain her excitement. \nWhen they both step inside the house, Bigg Boss makes an official announcement about Mona and Vikrant getting married in the house and that the contestants will have to take all the responsibilities of the wedding as her fellow inmates. Amongst the contestants, Lopamudra, Rohan and Manu are asked to be the ladkiwale while Bani and Manveer are made to be the ladkewale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-17T19:55:33.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
