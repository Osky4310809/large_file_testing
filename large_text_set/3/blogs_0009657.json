If that even. \nHe blew his career by sitting during the anthem. seth1280  14 PM \nHe turned down a 16.9 contract option for 2017, therefore, he’s trying to get more than that. He’s not worth it. patriots123456  16 PM \nTeams don’t want distractions. It’s as simple as that. Mar 12, 2017 7:17 PM \nAmazing we continue to write articles and comment on him. stillabucsfan  18 PM \nMike glennon who hasn’t played for 2 years is going to be a starter but kaep is out of the league, gotta love it Mar 12, 2017 7:18 PM \nHe made his bed and now he has to lie in it. \nAnd lets make something clear…yes he sat during the anthem, but he also has absolutely stunk for 2 years. \nLater Kaep! pastabelly  19 PM \nAt this point, he’s a distraction wherever he goes and no coach needs that, especially from the quarterback. ctiggs  19 PM \nHaters will hate but kap will stay with us. Then we will continue to be on to six. #goNiners #NobodyhasitbetterthanUS mackcarrington  19 PM \nPoor Kaepernick. He’s a black who was raised by whites and somehow felt his personal identity was lost. He thought he found a cause to give himself a sense of identity. That would have been fine if he wasn’t already part of one of the largest and richest corporations in America. He badly misjudged the public reaction and backlash that he received. And now that his career is at a crossroads and he finds himself on the streets looking to maintain employment in the NFL, perhaps he realizes he picked the wrong battle. Now he says he will stand for the anthem. If he felt so strongly about his stance, he wouldn’t back down from his beliefs. Well, it’s obvious he realizes that his search for an “identity” has likely cost him a well paying job. chino1985  19 PM \nHa I love the shot at Jaws at the end of the article. Mar 12, 2017 7:20 PM \nhope nobody signs him Mar 12, 2017 7:20 PM \nHow oppressive. cglacius  25 PM \nIt’s called blackballed……whatever he has ever done good will be marginalized while his flaws are highlighted…..Most of the NFL hierchy are staunch conservatives….To them, he should be greatfull that he us not in a crackhouse somewhere with 6 kids by 6 different women…….he will never get another shot at all….. beachsidejames  25 PM \nWord is he has a bad knee. Mar 12, 2017 7:27 PM \nThere’s always a cabinet position in Raul Castro’s regime. truthfactory  27 PM \nThis is the worst possible outcome for Kap. I completely disagree with his protest, but at least last year you could say he was standing for what he believed in even if that had football and monetary consequences… yet this year when there was the threat of no money and no new contract out there, he caved and said he would now stand for the anthem. \nWorst of both worlds. Don’t have a contract and lost all credibility when he offered to stand to improve his chances at getting a new contract. No contract or respect for Kap.
