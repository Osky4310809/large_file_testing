Labour MPs have attacked Theresa May's Brexit plan Reuters \nMeanwhile, a group of 43 Labour MPs have written to May to protest against her Brexit proposals. \nIn an open letter , they said that leaving the single market and adopting World Trade Organisation rules if the government cannot strike a free-trade deal with the EU within two years would \"sail the UK economy on to the rocks\". \n\"Leaving without a deal would immediately impose tariffs on exports from the UK to the EU, as we would move on to World Trade Organisation tariff schedules,\" the MPs wrote. \n\"British manufacturers and farmers would face being priced out of their most important market, which buys 44% of all our exports. \n\"Businesses large and small in our constituencies would suffer, jobs would be lost and prices in the shops would rise.\" More from IBTimes UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-22T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-22T08:11:36.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
