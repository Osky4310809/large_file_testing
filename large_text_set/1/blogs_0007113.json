I didn't know if he was going to kill me or what.\"\nThe intruder wasn't prepared for what Roberson did next.\n\"I reached over there and grabbed this gun,\" she said. \"And when I swerved around, I pointed it at him and he ran.\"\nRoberson said she pursued the individual as he fled, firing shots at him.\n\"I'm not sure I didn't hit him,\" she told KSLA. \"I don't know yet. I sure tried. I sure was hoping.\"\n\"That was the scare of my life,\" she added.\nWhen asked what her intentions were, Roberson was straightforward.\n\"I tried to kill him,\" she stated. \"Anybody break in on me I'm going to kill them. He's going to kill me or I'm going to kill him.\"\nPolice have yet to identify the suspect.\nBowie County sheriff's Chief Deputy Jeff Neal said Roberson was fortunate not to have been injured in the altercation. He also said Roberson was well within her rights to make use of her firearm.\n\"It could have been worse for both individuals, both the victim and the suspect,\" Neal said. \"Every citizen, according to the Texas penal code, has the right to defend themselves and their family.\"\nA 2007 law passed in Texas gave citizens the right to use force rather than retreat in self-defense situations, the Texas Tribune reports. According to the law, use of deadly force is acceptable when an intruder has forcefully encroached on a person's home, vehicle or workplace.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T19:30:03.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
