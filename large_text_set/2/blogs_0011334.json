The practice is followed in Mumbai and Pune for several years now. While many welcomed the order, there were also others who found it more as an obligation than the real feelings of pride for the nation. In fact, in the case of Dangal when the anthem was played towards the end of the film, there were incidences of people made to stand again. The Supreme Court on Tuesday clarified that people are not obliged to stand up when the National Anthem is played as part of a film or documentary, as reported by ANI. (Also read: Did the National Anthem in Aamir Khan’s Dangal make you stand up? ) \nLast year on December 1, a bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Amitav Roy ordered the move stating that it was taken to instil “committed patriotism and nationalism” among the people. “The directions are issued, for love and respect for the motherland is reflected when one shows respect to the National Anthem as well as to the National Flag. That apart, it would instil the feeling within one, a sense committed patriotism and nationalism,” the bench had said. Zee NEWS reported, “Also, ordering for the playing of National Anthem before the film starts accompanied by the showing of National Flag on screen. The full version should be played and not the edited part of the anthem. Also, that the National Anthem cannot be played in between the film for any commercial benefit, SC had directed reportedly.” \nOnly recently a 52 year old man was thrashed for not standing up when the National Anthem was played before the screening of Dangal. There have been more such instances which were reported.
