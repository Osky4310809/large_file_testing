Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said Nunes should \"absolutely\" step away from the investigation after reports suggested he colluded with the White House. \n\"How can you be chairman of a major committee and do all these things behind the scenes and keep your credibility?\" Jones said on Tuesday. \"You can't keep your credibility!\" \nLast week, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee fumed that Nunes shared information with the White House about the investigation before he even shared it with them. The story got worse on Monday when The Washington Post reported that the White House did not want former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates to testify. Critics claim that explains why Nunes canceled scheduled public hearings into the investigation. \nThe White House denies these claims and welcomed a Yates testimony on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-29T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T01:15:07.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
