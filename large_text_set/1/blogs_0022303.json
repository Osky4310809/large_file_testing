Sources told them he died of a heart attack, but an autopsy is still pending.\nIn a 2015 New York Times profile , O’Denat explained his vision for the infamous site that often promoted overt violence, stating, “Hip-hop is for the sex, the drugs, the violence, the beefs, the culture. That’s the competitiveness of hip-hop, so I felt like the site needed to be R-rated.”\nThis news comes only two weeks after it was reported that WorldStarHipHop was making the jump to television with a deal on MTV 2 to produce a show where comedians, correspondents and cultural tastemakers would provide commentary on some of the most viral clips from the web portal.\nStay tuned for more details.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:24:56.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
