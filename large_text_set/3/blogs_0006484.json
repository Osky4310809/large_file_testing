The Football Association confirmed the sanction via their Twitter account on Wednesday after the Cherries centre-back had previously been charged with violent conduct: The FA @FA AFC Bournemouth’s Tyrone Mings will serve a five-match suspension, following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today. 3/8/2017, 4:30:01 PM The incident occurred during the 1-1 draw between the two teams at Old Trafford on Saturday, with Mings’ boot making contact with the head of Ibrahimovic while he was grounded. Referee Kevin Friend took no action on the field. Ibrahimovic later elbowed Mings, and while he escaped a red card, the Swede was hit with a three-match ban for his conduct on Tuesday. After the punishment was announced for Mings, Bournemouth released a statement saying they were \"extremely disappointed\" by the outcome. In the bulletin on their official website they added they consider it \"extraordinary that the charges can be described as 'proven' when there is absolutely no evidence to prove the incident was intentional.\" The FA, upon charging Mings, had stated the standard three-game ban a charge for violent conduct carries was \"clearly insufficient\" given the severity of the action, per Simon Stone of BBC Sport. Prior to both incidents aforementioned, the two players had tangled on the pitch, with Ibrahimovic appearing to throw Mings to the floor. Alex Shaw of ESPN felt there was a degree of pre-meditation from the Bournemouth man as a result: On the day, Mings and his Bournemouth team eventually dug in to earn a battling point at Old Trafford. With Andrew Surman sent off before half time, the visitors defended gallantly for much of the match, keeping out their illustrious opponents through heroic blocks and excellent goalkeeping from Artur Boruc. The Bournemouth stopper saved a second-half penalty from Ibrahimovic, too. Mings joined Eddie Howe's side ahead of the 2015-16 campaign from Ipswich Town for what was then an £8 million fee. However, he played just 12 minutes in his debut term due to injury and has only just fought his way back into first-team contention, making five Premier League starts.
