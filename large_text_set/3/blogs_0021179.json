The streaming service reportedly offered Chappelle a $60 million for three specials in total (these two, which he’d filmed prior to the deal, and an additional one filmed for Netflix), a sure sign of its faith in Chappelle’s bankability and its allegiance to his freedom of expression. But Chappelle’s Show had its iconic three-year run on Comedy Central over a decade ago. Whether or not Chappelle will pay the cost for speaking so freely in a time that is at least more outwardly sensitive and engaged with the spectrum of identities than it was back then remains to be seen. Advertisement \nThese specials will be refreshing to those who bristle at the impositions of modern liberal mores and who consider “PC culture” a hinderance. At times, Chappelle himself espouses such philosophy. At one point in Deep in the Heart of Texas , he ponders how much he owes trans people: “To what degree to I have to participate in your self-image? Is it fair that I have to change my whole pronoun game up for this motherfucker? That doesn’t make sense.” Multiple bits in The Age of Spin —one, in fact, from which the special derives its title—are focused on kids-these-days grousing from a man whose affect is crabby and soured, in general. Dave Chappelle says “fags” and “dykes” casually in conversations, but comes off more like a world-weary uncle than flat-out hateful. That’s just how Uncle Dave is. He’s from a different time. He’s the kind of guy refers to “prison fags” (locked-up guys sucking dick to pass time) and notes that AIDS affects “niggers, fags, and junkies” before landing on what could be considered a compliment, I guess: “Either God is white or the government hid that shit in disco balls. Only fun people get AIDS.” \nHe means well! Or well enough that he can get away with commenting on identities he has nothing to do with because of his comedic pragmatism. He sees the absurdity in everything and is on a perpetual mission to find the humor in common-sense responses to contemporary culture’s concerns. Take his thoughts on advances in gay rights in The Age of Spin : Advertisement \nI understand why gay people are mad and I empathize. I’m just telling you this as a black dude: I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ‘cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in 1955 [ sic ], somebody called me a nigger in traffic last Wednesday. \nLess charming is his observation on trans rights, again from Spin , which is supposed to be funny because it’s true but just smacks of ignorance: \nI was like how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics? If the police shot have as many transgenders as they did niggas last year, it’d be a fucking war in L.A. I know black dudes in Brooklyn—hard street motherfuckers—that wear high heels just to feel safe. \nThe fact of the matter is that 2016 was the deadliest year on record for trans people ( with 25-27 killed, depending on the sources ), and 2015 held the previous record . What made Chappelle confident in crafting a joke to expose the absurdity of “discrimination Olympics” was underreporting and general public apathy toward trans lives. His equivalency is certifiably false—at least, no war has broken out yet over all these trans deaths. And perhaps most flagrantly ignored is the intersectionality of the issue, as the vast majority of murdered trans people are those of color. Chappelle’s isn’t just a bad joke, it’s sloppy social commentary. It’s demonstrably incorrect. It perpetuates the idea that trans people are doing fine because some outspoken liberals have taken up the cause. It is here that Chappelle comes off not just as from a different time, but seriously out of touch. Sponsored \nBut Chappelle’s brand depends on his willingness to go there , and so he always goes there , whether discussing Paula Deen, diarrhea, his own foot fetish, ebola, Care Bears, or Michael Sam (whom he refers to Michael Sams and wonders what would happen if the first out gay man in the NFL were to brutalize his “wife” as Ray Rice did : “Is that domestic violence or is that just two niggas working shit out in an elevator, you know what I mean?”). \nChappelle reserves his most in depth, complicated analysis for one of his heroes, Bill Cosby, who’s been accused of rape and/or other sexual misconduct by over 60 women at this point. Chappelle has caused controversy in the past for his discussion about this very subject, and attracted at least one heckler at a Syracuse show in 2015. Advertisement \nChappelle recalls the incident in the almost 20 minutes he devotes to Cosby in Spin , a show otherwise organized around sharing accounts of the four times Chappelle has met O.J. Simpson throughout his life (a brilliant framing device). I’ve transcribed Chappelle’s thoughts on Cosby and am pasting them below with minimal commentary: \nThe ‘70s were a wild era and while all this was going on, Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit, that’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes! Fifty-four! If he had raped 30 less people, that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over 400 hours of rape. It only takes 65 hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this nigga is Top Gun for sure. \nYeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York… the show didn’t go so good, all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like maybe 25 minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” \n“I know.” \nInstantly I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh my god! I’mma kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer.” I said, “I know.” \nAnd ladies, I need you to know that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass niggas. \nBut as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. \n“Women suffer!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T22:26:54.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
