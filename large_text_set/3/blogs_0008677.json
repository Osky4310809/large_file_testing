I don't believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign.\" \nOn Sunday, Conway told the Record's Peter Kelly that \"there are many ways to surveil each other,\" and detailed that surveillance is possible through phones, televisions sets and even microwaves. \"We know this is a fact of modern life,\" she said. \nConway also told \"Good Morning America\" Monday that she was misquoted. \"I wasn't making a suggestion about Trump Tower,\" she said. \nShe vented on Twitter Monday morning to clarify her comments to the Record and wrote that the Record's headline, \"Kellyanne Conway alludes to even wider surveillance of Trump campaign,\" was simply written wrong. 1/2: On wiretap claims, I have said many times that we are pleased the House/Senate Intel Committees are investigating & will comment after — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) March 13, 2017 2/2: response to Bergen Record was about surveillance articles in news & techniques generally, not about campaign. Headline just wrong. — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) March 13, 2017 \nStill, people had a field day with her comments.
