She never wanted to give up hope. Me and Julie are still friends. \n“I’ve got such admiration for everyone on that estate, but especially Julie. \n“She’s stronger than I am. She helped me with the whole journey all along.” Read More Shannon Matthews was abducted by her mum Karen (Photo: PA) Karen had been campaigning to find her daughter (Photo: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror) \nSheridan will star alongside Game Of Thrones actress Gemma Whelan as Karen in The Moorside, while Sherlock star Sian Brooke will play their neighbour Natalie. \nShannon, who was nine at the time of her abduction, was missing for nearly a month and was found in a house that belonged to Michael Donovan, uncle of Craig Meehan — Karen’s paedophile boyfriend. \nThe kidnapping was subsequently discovered to have been planned by Karen and Michael to make money from the publicity. \nBoth were found guilty of kidnap, false imprisonment, and perverting the course of justice and given eight-year jail terms. \nThe Moorside, however, will focus on the community behind the Shannon Matthews story and Julie’s guilt after helping get her friend convicted.
