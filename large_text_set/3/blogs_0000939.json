We will work with your commission to continue to sensitise Nigerians on the need for them to know that some places are not just worth it,’’ she said. \nIn her remarks, Farouk commended Dabiri-Erewa for her efforts toward ensuring that Nigerians in diaspora were treated with dignity. \nShe condemned the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa and pledged her commission’s commitment to a sustained advocacy to end such unwarranted attacks. \nThe federal commissioner promised to work with Dabiri-Erewa to educate Nigerians on the dangers of irregular migration. \nShe said: ‘’These programmes will better inform Nigerians on their options, so they can make informed decision and develop realistic expectations when traveling outside the country. \n“It is important to note that the issue of sensitisation is an offshoot of the National Migration Dialogue. \n“The dialogue highlighted the need to establish a migration desk in all states and local governments which will provide sensitisation from the grassroots level in order to curb the root causes of irregular migration.’’ \nAccording to her, the commission has also developed return, re-admission and reintegration programme which provides referrals to settlement services for returnees. \nFarouk said the commission had also developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), for the conduct of returnees, readmission and reintegration of Nigerians as part of efforts to further cater for returnees. \n“What is obtainable is an adhoc approach which is not sustainable. \n“The SOP when operationalised, will ensure that the returning Nigerian migrants are adequately reintegrated into the society. \n“The SOP has been validated by the relevant stakeholders but yet to be institutionalised. We therefore seek your partnership to ensure the operationalisation,’’ she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T02:17:51.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
