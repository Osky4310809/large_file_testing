Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDowning Street has signalled it has no intention to cancel Donald Trump's state visit to Britain despite a petition to do so nearing a million signatures. \nThe US President's travel ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim countries has provoked worldwide outrage and chaos. \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn led wide calls for Theresa May to cancel Trump's state visit to Britain - which she announced in a White House visit hours before the ban was signed. \nA petition urging the Prime Minister to \"prevent\" Trump making a state visit had passed 950,000 signatures by 8.40am today. Read More Worldwide fury at Donald Trump's shameful ban on Muslims as US immigration is plunged into crisis \nYet in response to the furore this morning, a Downing Street spokesman said: \"The invitation has been extended and accepted\". \nAn unknown government source told the BBC cancelling the visit would be a \"populist gesture\" that would \"undo everything\". A petition against the state visit was nearing 1million signatures this morning \nA Number 10 source stressed to the Mirror that this was not an official statement from the government. \nTory MPs, Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel and Olympic hero Sir Mo Farah were among those who condemned the \"unamerican\" ban last night.

What does the travel ban do? \nThe travel ban was signed in an executive order by Donald Trump on Friday night. Here is what it does. Bans entry to the US for people born in seven majority Muslim countries - Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. It was originally thought to include green card and valid visa holders, but the British Foreign Office claims only those flying from the seven countries - and not British dual nationals - will be affected. Suspends the Syrian refugee plan indefinitely Suspends entire refugee plan for 120 days Prioritises Christian refugees over Muslims Caps refugee total to 50,000 Foreign Office advice for Brits travelling to the US \nThis advice was taken at 9am Monday.
