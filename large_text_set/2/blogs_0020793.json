Naik was speaking at the inauguration of the two-day World Integrated Medicine Forum on Regulation of Homoeopathic Medicinal Products here. \n“We welcome with open arms those international manufactures who are willing to open their plants in India under ‘Make in India’ policy of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi . We are committed to provide all kinds of support for these endeavours,” he said. \nA Memorandum of Understanding was also signed between Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States (HPCUS) and two Indian bodies- Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine and Homoeopathy (PCIM&H) and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH)- for cooperation in the field of homoeopathic medicine. \nAccording to the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), the use of homoeopathy is steadily growing in India. The sector exhibited an annual growth rate of 26.3 per cent last year, it said. \nWatch this also: \nLawmakers, regulators, manufacturers, pharmacopeial experts from various regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical industries from 25 countries are participating in the event which began today. \nWhile the focus of the event is on strengthening regulatory mechanisms, other topics of discussion include trade opportunities, reforming policies and ensuring greater accessibility. \n“Regulatory provisions still need more strengthening. Lack of well-defined and well-adhered regulatory framework can be a deterrent in growth of homoeopathy,” Joint Secretary AK Ganeriwala said at the event.
