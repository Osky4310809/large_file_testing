Facebook: permalink.php ID: 10474621 According to an Italian newspaper , Facebook has since apologised. As well as reinstating Drago’s account, which it claims was deactivated by mistake, the company said it had deleted the groups in question.\nBut Boldrini said many violent groups still exist on the site.\n“My question is this: what are Facebook’s policies? Whose side is Facebook on? It is sad and worrying that the company of a young entrepreneur like Mark Zuckerberg, who claims to defend the rights of an open society where nobody is discriminated against, deletes a profile like Arianna’s but allows such obscenity, sexism and misogyny, which scars the dignity of women, to exist on its website”.\nBefore entering parliament in 2013, Boldrini worked at the UN High Commissioner For Refugees (UNHCR) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). She has been deployed on missions in former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Mozambique, Angola and Rwanda.\nAs in the US, where a BuzzFeed News analysis found that the most viral fake election news stories outperformed real news on Facebook, fake news came to prominence in Italy during a recent election. In the wake of a constitutional referendum last December, which cost the then prime minister Matteo Renzi his job, one analysis found that among the most shared referendum news stories many of the top articles were fake news.\nBoldrini’s campaign, “Basta Bufale” (“Enough with the fake news”), is being launched at a time when trust in traditional parties, institutions and media in Italy is lower than elsewhere in Europe, and public opinion in the country is increasingly polarised.\n“It is true that in Italy, like in many other countries, there is widespread distrust towards institutions and politics,” Boldrini said. “At the same time, an increasing number of people tend to not trust traditional news sources. Online, many seek to confirm whatever their bias may be, often ignoring facts. All this leads to an increasingly polarised debate and echo chambers where everyone just shouts and doesn’t listen to other points of view.\n“In this context, the risk is that people share fake news that aligns to their world view, and everyone just shouts over each other. There is no dialogue or a real exchange of opinions. This worries me greatly because it risks quashing democratic confrontation.”\nLast month, the co-founder of the anti-establishment and populist Five Star Movement (M5S), Beppe Grillo (who like Donald Trump likes accusing mainstream media of producing fake news), called on the creation of a jury of randomly selected members of the public to judge the veracity of news stories published by the media. Grillo and the M5S have also ac anyone attempting to tackle or disincentive disinformation and fake news as wanting to clamp down on freedom of expression.\nMeanwhile, others in Italy have suggested that regulation, and possibly state intervention, are the solution to beating fake news.\nBoldrini rejected both ideas: “I don’t know if fake news had an impact on the outcome of the US election, but I do believe that before any legislative solution is adopted, we should give people the opportunity to understand the issue, and provide them with the necessary tools. The answer should not be a “state authority against fake news” nor a “people’s tribunal” as some have suggested in Italy,” she said.\nView this image ›\nLaura Boldrini with Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella. Alessandro Bianchi / Reuters\nID: 10480425 Separate analysis published by BuzzFeed News last year revealed that among those publishing and sharing fake news and hyperpartisan content in Italy are websites and social media accounts directly linked to the M5S.\nThough she doesn’t name any specific political party, the speaker of the chamber claims that “political parties that spread fake news and disinformation demonstrate that they are prepared to do anything and have no ethical qualms. Untruths and deception as political tools are the worst kind of politics.”\nBeyond the appeal, Boldrini’s broader effort to battle disinformation is a focus on education.\n“We need to start from schools and universities, and insist on a formation that helps young people to distinguish between credible sources, and less reliable ones, as well as help to develop critical judgement and a verification culture and skills-set,” Boldrini said, citing an “internet committee” of MPs and experts. Among its tasks, MPs and experts go into schools across the country to teach students and teachers how to use the internet more responsibly.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1121202051323325&id=325228170920721", "http://www.bastabufale.it/", "http://www.ilblogdellestelle.it/una_giuria_popolare_per_le_balle_dei_media.html", "http://www.agi.it/politica/referendum/2016/12/02/news/referendum_e_fact_checking_la_notizia_pi_condivisa_una_bufala-1289280/", "https://www.ft.com/content/e7280576-cddc-11e6-864f-20dcb35cede2?segmentId=6132a895-e068-7ddc-4cec-a1abfa5c8378", "http://www.corriere.it/tecnologia/17_gennaio_20/arianna-drago-violenti-social-facebook-sono-nostre-case-cosi-li-denuncio-b4096b02-df2b-11e6-ac31-10863be346e7.shtml"], "published": "2017-02-08T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:53:05.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
