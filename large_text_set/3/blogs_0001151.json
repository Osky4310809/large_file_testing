Another thing you can do is donate your time by walking dogs or fostering them , but what if those just don't seem like the right fit for you? We asked Rocky Kanaka, host and creator of Save Our Shelter , what else people could possibly do to help, and as an expert in this arena, he had several suggestions. \n\"I always encourage people to think of what they enjoy,\" he said.

Call up a shelter and ask if they need someone to photograph the animals for adoption to put on the website. If it's something you excel at, chances are you'll take a quality photo that will help get that animal adopted. If you're an accountant, see if you can donate your services to a shelter.
