It is the sixth and supposedly the final installment of the popular videogame based movie franchise, that is spearheaded by director Paul WS Anderson. In the lead is his pretty wife, Milla Jovovich as the zombie fighter with memory issues. The movie also stars Iain Glen, pretty well known among the Game of Thrones fans as Ser Jorah Mormont (or rather, the guy who is perennially friendzoned). Unlike his character in GoT, here he is the main villain, Dr Isaacs, the man who is responsible for the zombocalypse that is plaguing the earth in the movie. \nSo what has this movie anything to do with our beloved Bollywood star, Salman Khan ? Is he having a guest appearance or something like that in the Hollywood production? Or does Milla Jovovich make her belt do the dance a la Dabanng? Well, nothing of that sort. The connection between Salman Khan and Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is this below actress… \nFor those who are not familiar with Hollywood much, that’s Ali Larter for you! So who is she and how is she linked to Salman Khan? Well, if you are familiar with Salman Khan’s filmography, you might be aware that he was the lead in an Indo-American production called Marigold, that was directed by Willard Carroll in 2007. Guess who was the heroine? Yup, that’s right. It was Ali Larter. \nHere’s a song from the movie… \nAli Larter is not a newcomer to the Resident Evil franchise. She is well known for her character, Claire Redfield that has appeared in two Resident Evil movies before, playing buddy to the lead. \nApart from Ali Larter, the movie also stars Ruby Rose , whom you might be familiar for forming a tag team with Deepika Padukone in the climax of xXx: Return of Xander Cage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:42:45.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
