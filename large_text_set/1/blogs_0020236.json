Britney Spears Shaves Her Head and Marries Kevin Federline in First ‘Ever After’ Trailer Lifetime just dropped the first trailer for its upcoming Britney Spears biopic, Britney Ever After , and there’s no shortage of juicy drama. The 30-second teaser shows Australian actress Natasha Bassett portraying the 35-year-old pop star during some of her biggest ups and downs, including her 2004 wedding to Kevin Federline and her 2007 head-shaving breakdown. EXCLUSIVE: Lance Bass Reacts to *NSYNC’s Casting in Britney Spears Biopic: ‘They Look Like the Backstreet Boys’ “Everything’s just kinda this blur, you know ... until you hit rock bottom,” the actress says during the trailer. “I wanna be strong, for my fans. They’re what keeps me going.” Premiering on Feb. 18, the biopic also stars Power Rangers star, Clayton Chitty, as Federline, and Nathan Keyes as Spears’ former boyfriend, Justin Timberlake. ET caught up with Bassett in November, where she discussed why she believes she’s the perfect person to play the iconic pop star. \"I have a huge amount of respect for Britney and for her career,\" said the Bassett. \"I listened to her music so much growing up. I have videos of me as a tween practicing her songs in the mirror with a hairbrush in my hand.\" \"I've watched every video I can. Every interview I can,\" she continued. \"I just immersed myself into Britneyland.\" For more on Bassett, watch the video below.
