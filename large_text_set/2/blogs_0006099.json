Around the 6-second mark, the friend we mentioned up above decides he needs to be involved, so he attempts a flying kick at one of the assailants. And he misses! And he falls square on his butt! And a woman screams for him! It’s the best. Now we’re cooking. \nThe friend, to his credit, is not to be diminished by such an embarrassing slip-up. He goes on to try a running haymaker from behind (kind of a chicken move, but no matter), misses that, backs off again, hitches his pants up, and goes for a second haymaker. When he misses that, the force of his own air-punch carries him clear across the street. Meanwhile, the two original dudes are still just grappling and shoving like a couple of bozos. \nWatch the full fight below. No one lands a punch, no one lands a finisher, but it’s so entertaining.
