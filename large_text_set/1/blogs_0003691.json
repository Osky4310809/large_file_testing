The victory was the Americans’ second over Russia in the tournament.\nColin White scored twice in the win. Denis Gurianov scored twice in the game and twice in the shootout in Russia’s elimination.\nThe United States will play either Canada or Sweden in the gold medal game on Jan. 5 at 8 p.m. ET in the Bell Centre in Montreal. TV information is listed here. Russia will play the loser of Canada-Sweden for the bronze medal at 3:30 p.m. ET before the gold medal game.\nRussia has earned a medal in six consecutive World Juniors. \nThe semi-final game began with a quick pace, but Russia gained two of the earliest scoring chances. USA goalie Tyler Parsons stopped a back-hander from Russian winger Denis Gurianov minutes into the game, but he lost the puck on a Kirill Kaprizov wrap-around attempt midway through the period. \nKaprizov gives Russia an early 1-0 lead pic.twitter.com/T9tO8lsser \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) January 4, 2017 It was Kaprizov’s eighth goal of the tournament and the 26th point for Russia’s top line. Russia’s goalie had a brain freeze of his own just as the first period ended, however. \nClayton Keller whips the puck on net and somehow ties it up for USA. Horrible goal for Samsonov to give up. pic.twitter.com/Gsm0Xn0h9i \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) January 4, 2017 The goal would ultimately be changed to belong to Colin White. \nRussia re-took the lead less than three minutes into the second period. Gurianov finally cashed in off a rebound, beating Parsons for his second tournament goal and a 2-1 Russia lead. \nGurianov puts Russia back on top 2-1 pic.twitter.com/ow1xAUcFFs \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) January 4, 2017 When Yakov Trenin went off for slashing, the United States immediately cashed in. Captain Luke Kunin finished off a gorgeous passing sequence by Jeremy Bracco and Jordan Greenway. It was Kunin’s second goal of the tournament. \nAnother look at Kunin's power play goal pic.twitter.com/UdgRaWT4MM \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) January 4, 2017 After Kunin’s goal, the United States began buzzing around the Russian net. After killing a penalty, the USA took a 3-2 lead when Colin White’s shot was deflected into Samsonov’s net. \nColin White gives USA the 3-2 lead pic.twitter.com/pwVOSbyG6q \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) January 4, 2017 A minute after Clayton Keller’s penalty shot was denied by Samsonov in the third period, Gurianov slipped the puck under Parsons on the breakaway for the game-tying goal. Gurianov was arguably the best player for either team on Wednesday. \nGuryanov with the goal to tie it for Russia pic.twitter.com/OrQQZsqGBj \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) January 4, 2017 The game flew into overtime, and the United States gave up a couple of high-grade chances. Their highest-grade chance, however, didn’t go in because of ... magic.\nGreat chance for USA doesn’t go pic.twitter.com/kijv3gf6OY \n— Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) January 4, 2017 The shootout went past the obligatory five rounds and ended when Troy Terry dangled his way to a game-winner. \nTroy Terry had to score here.
