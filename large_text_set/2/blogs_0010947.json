Period. Today in his incomprehensible press conference , he remarked with certainty that he has no intention of telling anyone what he plans to do abroad. \n“I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea and I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in Iran.” \nClearly, this philosophy also extends to his plans for immigration. Today, several Democrats who are members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) were actually kicked out of a meeting with Thomas Homan, the Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) —the very same meeting that they requested last week but was canceled last minute on Tuesday by Homan. \n\"I'm pretty shaken,\" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.). \"I've been here 25 years and I've never been told by the Speaker of the House that I can't attend a meeting I've requested.\" [...] \nA source inside the room said House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte told Democrats not on the list to leave. The Virginia Republican defended his decision, saying in a brief interview afterwards that the arrangement was \"agreed upon ahead of time\" and noting there were more Democrats than Republicans in the meeting. \nApparently, House Democrats were told that the reason for the cancellation of the original meeting was because it needed to be bipartisan. This appears to be little more than excuses and alternative facts since we know that they don’t have any intention to answer for the mass raids and deportations they are planning. While Homan agreed to eventually meet with the full CHC “in the future” (whatever that means), he also left them with this tidbit of information: \nRep. Linda Sanchez said lawmakers were told by Homan that they \"can and should expect many more arrests and removals this year.\" \nMore proof that this bunch plans to make “A Day Without Immigrants” into a country without immigrants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:15:11.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
