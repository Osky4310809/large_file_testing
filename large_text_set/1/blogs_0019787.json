Chelsea Manning , who leaked classified information.\nSaucier’s attorney, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News that he met with Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, about Petty Officer First Class Saucier’s case, and at Flynn’s request submitted a formal pardon request.\nDaigle said the punishment didn’t fit the crime.\n“It was a hyper-charged political atmosphere,” Daigle said, “politics played a role in it.”\nSEE ALSO \nSailor who took classified photos wants the 'Clinton treatment' :0 WASHINGTON – A 29-year-old sailor in the U.S Navy who... Sailor who took classified photos wants the 'Clinton treatment' Saucier, who served as a machinist’s mate aboard the USS Alexandria from 2007 to 2012, used his cellphone to photograph parts of the submarine’s nuclear propulsion system while it was docked at the Naval Submarine Base in Groton, Conn.\nSaucier, who is married and has a 2-year-old daughter, began his 12-month sentence in October at the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, Mass.\nHe was convicted of unauthorized retention of national defense information, which is a felony, and received an “other-than-honorable” discharge from the Navy. He faced a possible 10 years in jail, his lawyers said.\nHis problems began when a worker at the naval base found Saucier’s cellphone near a Dumpster and, while going through it, found the photographs. The worker brought the cellphone to a retired Navy petty officer, who then notified federal agencies about the sensitive submarine pictures.\n“When you look at how many years ago this occurred, coupled with his military service, and other individuals such as Hillary Clinton and [Clinton aide] Huma Abedin, who clearly mishandled classified information, it’s unfair,” said Greg Rinkley, one of the attorneys who represented Saucier. “It smacks of two types of justice systems in the United States.”\nAbedin was a Clinton adviser whose estranged husband and former congressman Anthony Weiner was found to have some of the former secretary of state’s emails on his computer when it was seized by federal investigators in connection to another case.\nDaigle said that when he served as a military police officer in Iraq from 2005 to 2006, he saw “hundreds, or thousands” of photos that service personnel had taken that could be considered sensitive. The norm was to handle them in-house, Daigle said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T03:03:11.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
