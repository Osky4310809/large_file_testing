This time, the Ibiza will be available solely in five-door hatch form, as the three-door and wagon have been dropped. \nWith 5.4 million units sold since 1984, the Ibiza an important product for VW’s Spanish brand. It is described as one of the three main pillars in the range, along the bigger and just-facelifted Leon and Ateca SUV . The fact that the new Ibiza is the first VW Group car to use the new MQB A0 modular platform, ahead of the next-gen Polo , is also a sign of confidence in the brand. \nThe Modular Quer Baukasten platform supports different body types within the same segment and different wheelbase configurations to be achieved from the same base. Seat’s investments and R&D expenditure in recent years were partially allocated to adapt its Martorell factory to the new MQB A0 platform. The number of parts using hot-forming tech has been increased, and that contributes to reduced weight and increased rigidity. Seat claims 30% greater torsional stiffness and NVH levels of “much larger and luxurious cars”. \nIt may look familiar thanks to Seat’s now trademark super sharp lines, but the Ibiza is all-new. The new model is 87 mm wider, 2 mm shorter and 1 mm lower than the five-door it replaces. The wheelbase is 95 mm longer (2,564 mm) and boot volume is up by 63 litres for a total of 355 litres (with lower load height), which means more space for humans and their stuff. \nFor example, rear legroom has increased by 35 mm, while headroom is up by 24 mm in the front and 17mm in the rear. The seats are 42 mm wider too, making the new Ibiza one of the best in its class in this area. \nIn the engine room, there are three Euro 6 aluminium block and cylinder petrol engines to choose from. A three-cylinder 1.0 TSI with 95 PS or 115 PS will be joined by a new four-cylinder EVO 1.5 TSI unit in late 2017 with 150 PS. In the diesel camp, the 1.6 TDI comes in 80 PS and 95 PS guises. 95 PS and lower engines come with a five-speed manual, while the others get a 6MT. A seven-speed dual-clutch DSG auto will also be available. \nThe new Ibiza will be offered in four trim levels: S, SE, FR and a new XCELLENCE version. FR is the sporty red car seen here rocking a rear diffuser and twin pipes, exclusive front bumper and exterior black pack. The FR trim includes stiffer suspension and offers four mode settings of Comfort, Eco, Sport and Individual. The XCELLENCE trim will also offer this later on, with a softer setting. \nThe interior ambient LED lighting for the FR and XCELLENCE versions comes in two colours, red and white. Full LED lights on the new Ibiza (headlights, dashboard, indicators and rear fog lights) are new in its class. \nDriving assistance systems such as Front Assist and Adaptive Cruise Control are available alongside keyless entry with “heartbeat” push start button, new-gen front and rear parking sensors and a rear view camera with feed shown on an eight-inch touchscreen. There’s also a unique wireless charger with GSM amplifier. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Mirror Link connectivity are included. There’s also a Beats sound system with DSP, seven speakers and an eight-channel 300W amplifier.
