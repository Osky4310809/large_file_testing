Listen, I’m not walkin’ around like fuckin’ Idris Elba, know what I mean? … I’m not gonna walk into the club and be like, ‘Oh shit I’m the sexiest guy in here.’ The reason why they want to fuck with me is because of what I do [in the studio]. So I’d rather just focus on doing that. \nCan’t argue with that, right? \nThe Weeknd broke up with model Bella Hadid just a few months ago, but that clearly hasn’t stopped him from making quick moves. Instagram \nHowever, it doesn’t appear he’s looking to tie the knot any time soon. \nSpeaking about marriage, he said, \nI feel like I’m the kind of guy that would have kids before getting married. The first thing would be kids. Marriage is scary to me, man. \nWho knew? \nIf you think this dude is promiscuous now, well, you have no idea about his apparently checkered past. \nSpeaking on how he’s changed, The Weeknd said, \nRight now, I’m much more, like, self-regulating than I was four years ago, when I first started getting everything and enjoying life. \nI don’t focus on it as much as I used to. You know what I mean? Before it’s like, ‘Holy fuckk — this is amazing.’ Right now, it’s like a good song turns me on way more. Like, that gets me horny, like, literally gets me horny. \nInteresting. REX/Shutterstock \nSpeaking about his recent album, Starboy , The Weeknd said, \nI worked really hard on this album [Starboy]. And I felt like I need to relieve a lot of stress. \n[Cutting off my hair] feels good, ’cause I get to blend in. If I want to go to a club, I can just go and I’m not there. I can go to a restaurant and I’m not there. I look like everybody else, which is boring, but maybe I just want to look like everybody else for a bit. \nI really, really hope Selena Gomez and The Weeknd work out. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
