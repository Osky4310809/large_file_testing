They haven’t been very active in the community since then, but it seems they aren’t done with the Android ecosystem either. Yesterday, it was announced that Razer had acquired both the assets and the entire 30-person team behind the Nextbit Robin .\nSo, many are asking what this means for Nextbit’s flagship smartphone. Nextbit has confirmed they are no longer selling the Robin and its accessories through their official channels (although you can still buy it from Amazon as I write this up). Any remaining units being sold right now are part of the company’s last batch of devices and there will not be any additional ones manufactured. Nextbit has also announced what this means for customers who currently own the Robin.\nNextbit CEO Tom Moss says they will continue to offer hardware support for the Nextbit Robin for 6 more months (for warranties and such). On top of that, current customers can expect to receive software updates (both new Android OS updates and security patches) for the next 12 months. After that though, Nextbit will no longer be working on the Robin. Instead, they are said to be working as an “independent division inside Razer,” and will be focused on “unique mobile design and experiences.”\nWhile this is definitely bad news for those who wanted to see Nextbit succeed, it’s certainly a better outcome than other technology companies faced when they had to sell their assets. We’ll have to wait and see if the team continues to work on mobile hardware, or if they will be focused on integrating their cloud technology into current and future Razer products.\nSource: Nextbit ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T17:24:55.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
