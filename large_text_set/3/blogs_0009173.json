Twitter \nHave you ever been dying to re-watch an old favorite movie or show, but Netflix foils your nostalgia-filled plans by not offering your heart's desire on the platform? Well, thanks to Business Insider , we now know that the streaming service has a relatively under-the-radar page that allows subscribers to put in a request for titles they'd like to see become available. So perhaps all those new videos that arrive on Netflix every month aren't actually chosen at random. \nThe \"Request TV shows or movies\" page—which, for the record, makes no promises when it comes to granting your requests—apparently lives under Netflix's Help Center . The page reads, \"Have a TV show or movie you'd like to see on Netflix? Tell us about it below! This form is the one and only place to submit content requests\" and is followed by a form where users can enter in three title requests. \nBut not so fast. If you were thinking that you'd take this opportunity to request your favorite shows over and over again, don't bother. Netflix says that it keeps track of all user requests, so putting in a request for a title more than once won't do any good. But if you're lucky enough to have your pick chosen, Netflix promises it'll let you know so that you can start streaming ASAP. \nAnd while you wait for your request to become available, might we suggest just browsing your regular ol' Netflix homepage? After all, the site does use a fancy algorithm to determine what kinds of shows and movies you like, so chances are, you'll never be without something to watch. \nNow BRB, we're off to edit our wish list of shows to a more reasonable number of suggestions—if that's even possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T00:53:49.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
