AP Photo/Mark Lennihan\nThe most convenient feature a company can offer is a generous return policy. Whether you never got around to wearing a pair of pants, or you deeply regret spending $200 on a juicer , a helpful return policy can save you from your bad decisions and help you save money .\nThe best stores go above and beyond. Retailers like L.L. Bean will take items back after decades, even without a receipt. And Trader Joe's will take food back even if you already ate some of it.\nHere are 20 companies with the best return policies.\nView As: One Page Slides L.L. Bean jimshooz7/Flickr The Maine-based outdoor gear and clothing retailer famously has one of the most generous return policies available. They have a 100% lifetime satisfaction guarantee , which has led people to return items that have been used for years or all but destroyed . The company might lose money with such lenient returns, but they consider their promise to the customer important enough — and the word-of-mouth significant enough — that they keep it anyway.\nJust note that you'll have to pay for shipping to return items ordered online unless you go to a physical store or get an L.L. Bean credit card.\nREI Glassdoor This L.L. Bean competitor once had the same generous return policy, but too many people abused it . REI also worried it was getting a reputation as being easily deceived, according to NPR . It had nicknames like \"Rental Equipment Inc.,\" \"Rent Every Item,\" and \"Return Every Item.\"\nSo REI scaled back their policy, but it's still incredibly generous. They have a 100% satisfaction guarantee and any item can be returned within a year of purchase .\nNordstrom Andrew Chin/Getty Images for Nordstrom Nordstrom, too, curtailed its famously generous return policy. As of this year, it ended its no-questions-asked attitude and doesn't allow customers to return \"Special Occasion\" dresses without a tag. It also doesn't give refunds in cash anymore, unless the customer paid in cash.\nRegardless, the Nordstrom return policy is still great for a fashion retailer. Each item is handled on a case-by-case basis, so there's no hard limit on how much time passes before you can return an item.\nJust be sure not to confuse Nordstrom with their sister outlet, Nordstrom Rack, which doesn't take returns after 90 days .\nBed Bath & Beyond Getty Images Bed Bath & Beyond is yet another retailer that curbed its return policy , but it's still generous.\nIf you don't have a receipt but you purchased an item in the past year, they'll refund you 80% of the item's value. But if you have the receipt , you can get the full value of the item back and there's no limit to how much time passes before you can return it.\nAmazon AP As long as you meet the return window, Amazon's policy is flexible. The precise return window depends on the type of item, but it's usually 30 days . Amazon also pays for return shipping.\nJust make sure you're buying the item for Amazon to meet their return policy. Third party sellers on the site have their own policies.\nZappos Flickr/loiclemeur Zappos, which is owned by Amazon, offers free returns along with its famous free shipping. Items just need to be in their original condition and packaging, and can be returned within a year of purchase.\nWalmart Joe Raedle/Getty Walmart takes back almost anything within 90 days, as long as it's in the original packaging .\nCostco A Costco shopping cart is shown at a Costco Wholesale store in Carlsbad, California September 11, 2013. /File Photo REUTERS/Mike Blake Costco has one of the most generous return policies of any store. Anything can be returned at any time. The exceptions are perishables and electronics, the latter of which have a 90 day limit.\nDon't abuse it, though. Every Costco member has an ID, which means they easily track who buys and returns what, and will flag chronic returners .\nTarget Joe Raedle / Getty Images Target brand items have a one-year exchange or return policy , while most other items sold at the store can be returned within 90 days if they're in new condition. You will usually need a receipt, though.\nHome Depot Flickr / Mike Mozart One of the benefits of Home Depot's policy is that they have a one-year guarantee on live goods, like house plants and perennials . So if your flowers don't bloom, they'll send you a replacement for free.\nIn other areas, they offer a wide latitude for returns , with just a handful of categories being limited to 30 days. They'll also pay for shipping for a lot of items if you want to return them online.\nMacy's AP Photo/Mark Lennihan Macy's will take back anything \"in saleable condition\" within a year of purchase. If you don't have a receipt or proof of purchase, you have six months to return it, and you'll get back store credit.\nTrader Joe's Michael Nagle/Getty Images The grocery chain has a \"no questions asked\" return policy. You can return everything. Yes, even food.\n\"Just bring back whatever you haven't eaten and we'll refund your money, no questions asked,\" their website reads . \"It might sound like a food-lover's fantasy, but for us it's just the way we do business.\"\nCVS AP/Gene J. Puskar The pharmacy and convenience store has a 100% guarantee on beauty products. Even if you've opened it, bring it back to the store with a receipt and they'll refund the full purchase price .\nAthleta Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Athleta While Gap and Banana Republic have 45-day limits on returns, their sibling store, Athleta, doesn't have any time limit . They'll also pay to ship items back to them if you'd like to return them by mail.\nKohl's AP Photo/Danny Johnston The retailer will take back any item at any time if you return it in a store. If you don't have a receipt, they'll still take your item back if you paid with a credit card.\nBloomingdale's John Sciulli/Getty Images Bloomingdale's will take back anything \"in saleable condition\" within a year of purchase, even if you don't have a receipt.\nBath & Body Works AP \"No sale is ever final\" at Bath & Body Works, according to its site . If you're not satisfied with your purchase, they'll always allow you to exchange it. If you have a receipt, they can also give you a refund.\nLand's End Matthew Horwood/Getty Images for Royal Enfield The Land's End satisfaction guarantee lets you make a return of any item at any time for its purchasing price. You'll need a receipt. If you make a replacement order online, it's free shipping , too.\nAnthropologie Yana Paskova/Getty Images Anthropologie will accept returned items at any time with the exception of furniture, which has a 30 day limit. Just make sure to bring the receipt.\nClarks Miquel Benitez/Getty Images Clarks will take back any item within 90 days if it's unworn and you have a receipt. If you ordered the item online, they'll cover the shipping fees, too.\nRead the original article on INSIDER . Follow INSIDER on Facebook . Copyright 2017.
