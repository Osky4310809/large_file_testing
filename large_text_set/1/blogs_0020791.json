A Green Summit Middle Eastern food concept failed shortly after launch, leaving the company on the hook for just $25,000 as opposed to the remainder of a lease, equipment liquidation, and having to fire staff. \nInstead, Green Summit just cut their minor (in the restaurant world) losses, and moved on to the next restaurant concept. Disruption in the restaurant industry is rare, so scaling in a way that eliminates most of its traditional bottlenecks — all while tapping into an ever-growing field of on-demand delivery services — is something you’ll probably seeing a lot of in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T00:23:59.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
