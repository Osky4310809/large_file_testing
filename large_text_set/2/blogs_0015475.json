The Celtics dropped one spot from their listing last year, but their value actually increased ($2.1 billion in 2016). \nThe New York Knicks came in at the top spot with a value of $3.3 billion, followed by the Los Angeles Lakers ($3 billion), Golden State Warriors ($2.6 billion) and Chicago Bulls ($2.5). \nWhile the No. 5 spot is certainly impressive, there’s a good chance Boston could climb higher on the list in the coming years. The C’s are currently the second-best team in the Eastern Conference, and their bevy of assets and future draft picks makes their future very bright . \nThumbnail photo via Winslow Townson/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:41:51.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
