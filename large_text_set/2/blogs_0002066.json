According to a report by Cybermedia Research , prices of smartphones are expected to be increased by nearly a fourth this year due to changes in tax structure after the implementation of goods and services tax (GST). In addition to GST, the rising cost of manufacturing parts, especially screen panels, will also contribute to the hike in the price of smartphones. \nAccording to the report, after the implementation of GST, the prices of mobile devices could increase by 15 to 25 percent through this year. For those unaware, GST will merge most of the existing taxes into a single system of taxation. Financial Minister Arun Jaitley is expected to implement GST some time between April to September, while some recent reports indicate a date in July. \nThe timing of GST’s implementation will be crucial for mobile manufacturers. If applied around September, brands will have difficulty in restructuring their product pricing strategy before the peak sales season of September and October. If GST is applied before July, vendors will have time to iron out their new pricing strategy before the festive season begins. As per the report, the country’s mobile phone market is expected to grow only marginally this year, by 270 million phones in shipments, while the share of smartphones may grow by five percent. \nThe government is yet to decide GST rates for mobile phones. However, reports suggest that it is making efforts to integrate the new tax regime with the differential duty that makes imports of fully built devices more expensive by 11.5 percent, and that much cheaper in making them locally. \nThe last couple of months have already been a struggle for mobile manufacturers due to demonetisation . The impact of the ban on old currency notes has resulted in inventory build-up of 25 to 30 percent. Now with the implementation of GST, companies may have greater struggle increasing shipments this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:17:06.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
