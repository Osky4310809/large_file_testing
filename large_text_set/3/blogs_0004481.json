A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Mar 6, 2017 at 2:02pm PST \nSeven years after the release of Tangled , we're more in love with Mandy Moore than ever. The This Is Us star visited Disney World on Monday, taking a minute to pose with the \"real\" Rapunzel , the character she voiced in the 2010 classic. \"Come on,\" she captioned. \"It's not a day at #Disneyworld without a quick pic with my pal #Rapunzel.\" Why does this fill our hearts with so much joy?! Moore is currently promoting the film all over again, since there's a new Disney Channel Original Movie, Tangled: Before Ever After , premiering on Friday. Two weeks after that , season one of the new show Tangled: The Series debuts. Rapunzel is a busy lady these days!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:56:50.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
