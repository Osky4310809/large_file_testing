Butler/Getty Images Tim Daniels Featured Columnist February 21, 2017 The Chicago Bulls are reportedly planning to keep star forward Jimmy Butler through Thursday's NBA trade deadline despite ample speculation about his future with the organization. K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday the Bulls have turned aside teams calling about Butler's availability and told them there are \"no plans to trade him.\" He did provide a caveat, however, stating a \"blockbuster offer\" could change their stance. A source close to the 27-year-old three-time All-Star selection told Seerat Sohi of ESPN.com he \"doesn't want\" a trade out of Chicago and would \"loathe to leave with unfinished business.\" Meanwhile, Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reported Monday the Bulls have informed Butler about receiving calls for him. But they also told the Marquette product they aren't openly shopping him, so he expects to stay unless \"something crazy happens\" over the next few days. Johnson provided one scenario where Chicago might actually engage in trade discussions: K.C. Johnson @KCJHoop There's posturing at this time of year. And if Celts engaged w/ Nets' pick, Bulls have to listen. But point is: Bulls aren't shopping Butler 2/21/2017, 4:31:25 PM The Boston Celtics have always felt like the most likely landing spot. Owning the Brooklyn Nets' first-round pick, which is on pace to possess the best lottery odds, is a massive bargaining chip if they decide to go all-in to acquire a major asset before the deadline. Acquiring Butler to slide in alongside the red-hot Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford would give them the star power necessary to seriously challenge the reigning champion Cleveland Cavaliers in the East. Of course, Boston is already within three games of the Cavs with its current squad. So the question is whether it's worth dealing the potential top pick, a cost-controlled future star, for Butler, whose cap hit will steadily rise to nearly $20 million by the 2018-19 season, per Spotrac . It's hard to find another logical match with the financial resources, trade chips and championship aspirations to make a serious push for the league's 12th-ranked player, according to Player Efficiency Rating . So the report about the Bulls likely keeping him doesn't come as a surprise. It will still be intriguing to see whether the Celtics, or a potential mystery team, make a final push before Thursday, though.
