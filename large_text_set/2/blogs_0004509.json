That was 30 minutes,\" Schmetzer said, according to MLSSoccer.com . \"We couldn't give him anymore. \n\"Next game we'll ramp him up a little more. We'll have to get doctors' clearance. We're taking it very carefully.\" Fans line up post-game to meet Captain America. From tonight's Timbers v.

That'll come with games, and I look forward to that process and hopefully being ready for the start of the season.\" \nThe recovery plan will also be encouraging to new U.S. coach Bruce Arena, who has said he is eager to have Dempsey available for the national team's crucial CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers against Honduras and Panama at the end of March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:38:45.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
