Warner Bros. also released a new photo to promote \"Justice League,\" which we can now say comes out this year, on November 17. \nThe (dark, and somewhat \"Guardians\"-like) new image shows five members of DC's Justice League, from left: Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Aquaman (Jason Momoa). As Collider noted, one guy is missing: \"There's no Superman (Henry Cavill) because Superman is busy being dead.\" That is not expected to keep him busy forever, though. \nDirector Zack Snyder teased the \"Justice League\" plot to USA Today , as Batman and Wonder Woman recruit a team of superheroes to battle a new threat to civilization. \"It was all about the filling-out of this massive comic-book pantheon with the biggest and coolest heroes we could.\" \nUSA Today noted that Wonder Woman will be getting a great character arc this year, starting with her solo film, set in World War I (which comes out June 2), and then returning to modern times to check out the post-\"Batman v Superman\" Diana Prince in \"Justice League.\" Snyder, who is a producer but not director of \"Wonder Woman,\" teased that young Diana learns in her solo film that \"humanity isn't always the most kind and awesome thing. It has its moments, but it can be brutal, and her coming to terms with that dichotomy is what we come to learn about her. And in 'Justice League,' she's fully evolved into someone who's embraced mankind, partly through Superman's sacrifice. She's like, 'All right, I've got to pick it up.'\" \nSpeaking of \"Wonder Woman,\" co-star Chris Pine promised Golden Globes red carpet reporters that it will be \"fantastic.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T05:47:34.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
