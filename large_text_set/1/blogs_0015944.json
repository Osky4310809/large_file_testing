Let’s go in chronological order.\nThe first one was the most ordinary. It’s just a dunk from Tobias Harris that beats the clock by mere fractions of seconds off a fast break driven by a steal. (There’s two plays in this highlight video, and it’s the second one.)\nA pair of Tobias jams, including that one that beat the buzzer. #PistonsNow pic.twitter.com/N370kOdwmP \n— Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) January 16, 2017 The second buzzer beater was much more extraordinary — do you care for a three-quarters court heave from Andre Drummond ? Here it is.\nHe called glass. #PistonsNow \n\nAndre Drummond #NBAVote pic.twitter.com/T1GtrkePcd \n— Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) January 16, 2017 For some teams, that’s enough buzzer beaters to last them an entire month. For Detroit, they wouldn’t even be satisfied with that lasting them a game. At the end of the third quarter, the Pistons hit ANOTHER shot to beat the buzzer, this time courtesy of Ish Smith. This is an absurd fallaway jumper, if we’re being honest, and he nails it all the same.\nYet another buzzer-beater as Ish gets in on the fun. #PistonsNow pic.twitter.com/9LICGQrpkq \n— Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) January 16, 2017 OK, cool. Who’s going to hit the game-winning buzzer beater? We’ll update this post if (when?) it inevitably happens, because that would only be appropriate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T06:41:40.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
