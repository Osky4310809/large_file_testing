'It just exacerbates the mood you are in.' His wild behaviour may have looked like fun on the outside, he added, but actually it was a sign of a distressed person looking for something he couldn't find.\" \nThe next year he married Texan barmaid Donna Peacock, but described their relationship as “a Godzilla story” during which he built a “crazy” house in Kenya. \nHe later left her for American production assistant Joan “Jo” Dalton, who he met on the set of Scandal, and the couple moved into the Savoy hotel together.

You change. \n\"When it no longer seemed to help, creatively, I mean, as it unquestionably had helped at one stage, it seemed time to give it up. \n\"Besides, attitudes to drinking have changed.
