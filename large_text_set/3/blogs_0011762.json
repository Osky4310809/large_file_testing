This ends now.' (Photo: W) \nThe Mean Girls star admitted realising she needed to get out of the relationship was one of the big turning points that sent her towards working with refugees in Syria as she \"took control back\" in her life. \nSpeaking on John Bishop: In Conversation With..., she continued: \"I took control back in my life and said, 'No one is going to hurt me, I'm gonna help other people and focus on taking care of myself.'\" \nPraising her later in the show, the comedian said he was very impressed that she decided to move to the UK and star in Speed-the-Plow in 2014.

Speaking to the voice coach I was working with she said you could tell people were coming [to see the play] in the hope you'd fail.

My own company, my own production company, my own management company, my own charity. \n\"I think everything started after my 30th birthday and I weirdly knew that for some reason.\" Video Loading  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T05:27:52.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
