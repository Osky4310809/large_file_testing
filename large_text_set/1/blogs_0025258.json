Trump On A Roll, Fires Director Of Immigration And Customs Enforcement Jan 30, 2017 10:46 PM 0 SHARES \nHaving said the infamous words \"you're fired\" once already this evening, when President Trump relieved acting AG Sally Yates of her duties just after 9pm Eastern, and perhaps realizing just how much he missed the sound, moments ago Trump also relieved acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Daniel Ragsdale , who was replaced with Thomas Homan, who previously led ICE's \"efforts to identify, arrest, detain, and remove illegal aliens, including those who present a danger to national security or are a risk to public safety, as well as those who enter the United States illegally or otherwise undermine the integrity of our immigration laws and our border control efforts.\" \nThere was no immediate reason given for Ragsdale's dismissal. \nThe full statement from DHS Secretary Kelly announcing Homan taking over as ICE Director is below. \nSTATEMENT FROM SECRETARY KELLY ON THE PRESIDENT'S APPOINTMENT OF THOMAS D. HOMAN AS ACTING ICE DIRECTOR \n\nWASHINGTON — Today, the president appointed Thomas D. Homan acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \n\nSince 2013 Homan has served as the executive associate director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). In this capacity, he led ICE's efforts to identify, arrest, detain, and remove illegal aliens, including those who present a danger to national security or are a risk to public safety, as well as those who enter the United States illegally or otherwise undermine the integrity of our immigration laws and our border control efforts. \n\nHoman is a 33-year veteran of law enforcement and has nearly 30 years of immigration enforcement experience. He has served as a police officer in New York; a U.S. Border Patrol agent: a special agent with the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service; as well as supervisory special agent and deputy assistant director for investigations at ICE. In 1999, Mr. Homan became the assistant district director for investigations (ADDI) in San Antonio, Texas, and three years later transferred to the ADDI position in Dallas, Texas. \n\nUpon the creation of ICE Homan was named as the assistant agent in charge in Dallas. In March 2009, Homan accepted the position of assistant director for enforcement within ERO at ICE headquarters and was subsequently promoted to deputy executive associate director of ERO. \n\nMr. Homan holds a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and received the Presidential Rank Award in 2015 for his exemplary leadership and extensive accomplishments in the area of immigration enforcement. \n\nI am confident that he will continue to serve as a strong, effective leader for the men and women of ICE. I look forward to working alongside him to ensure that we enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the United States consistent with the national interest. \nCan Trump make it a Monday termination trifecta? We will find out soon enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-31T05:49:48.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
