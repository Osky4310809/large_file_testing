That’s for the LC500, which comes with a 471-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8. The LC500h hybrid, despite having less horsepower overall (total system output is 354 hp), starts at $97,485, or a $4510 premium over the V-8. \nActual transaction prices will quickly rise into six-figure territory once buyers start adding the LC’s numerous options. Equipment such as a glass roof, 20-inch wheels, heating and ventilation for the front seats, a Mark Levinson audio system, park assist, and blind-spot monitoring are included in the Touring package, which bumps the price by $4000 in the V-8 model and $2790 in the hybrid. Performance-enhancing hardware, such as a limited-slip differential, comes in two optional sport packages, which also include sport seats. The big-ticket item on the option list is a Performance package that includes all equipment from the Sport package list, along with rear-wheel steering, a variable-ratio steering rack, and an active rear spoiler. It costs $10,000 for the LC500 and $8790 for the LC500h hybrid .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-10T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T01:41:34.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
