Barb Archer told reporters at a Wednesday morning news conference. “Was the officer a target because he was wearing a uniform?”\nThe shooting happened about 11 p.m. near the intersection of 16th and Wynkoop streets where the guard, 56-year-old Scott Von Lanken, was fielding a question about the RTD light rail from two women who had just left a nightclub. He died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, police said.\nVon Lanken, of Loveland, was a married father who served as a police officer in La Crosse, Wis., and was a longtime pastor at charismatic Christian churches in Arizona, Ohio, Texas and, most recently, Loveland.\nSteve Stoner, Loveland Reporter-Herald file In this 2007 file photo, Pastor Scott Von Lanken preaches and sings to those gathered at The Ranch for the Fire on the Front Range Revival Now conference. Von Lanken was identified as the victim of a late-night shooting while he was at work as a contract RTD security officer. He had worked for six years for security contractor Allied Universal and was assigned to the RTD beat, the company said.\nCummings was arrested after being found hiding a few blocks away from the shooting scene. He was being held without bail at Denver’s downtown jail for investigation of first-degree murder. A man with his same name and date of birth served in the Army from July 1997 to December 2002.\nArmy records show Cummings, whose last station was Schweinfurt, Germany, was an infantryman and was not deployed. His last rank was sergeant.\nOne of the women who witnessed the shooting told investigators the suspect had “a swollen face and different/weird-looking eyes,” according to court documents.\nDenver Police Chief Robert White said officers responded to the shooting scene within minutes, quickly reviewed security camera footage from nearby stores and tracked down Cummings within a half-hour. Investigators said Cummings was found with a gun.\nAccording to a probable-cause statement for Cummings, he was found with a 9mm handgun with a live round in its chamber. The weapon also had an eight-round capacity magazine loaded with seven rounds. The rounds in the gun were FC 9mm Luger ammunition.\nRelated Articles February 1, 2017 RTD guard Scott Von Lanken killed near Union Station was dedicated to the Gospel February 1, 2017 Man, woman and boy wounded in Fort Collins shooting February 1, 2017 Northeast Denver shooting leaves person with injuries February 1, 2017 Denver police say suspect shot RTD security officer while he was talking to two women near Union Station January 31, 2017 Daughter, 10, who died from gunshots in Highlands Ranch home is identified Police say they found one spent shell casing at the shooting scene — that of a FC 9mm Luger round, the statement says.\nLisa Meiman, a spokeswoman for the Denver office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said her agency is assisting by tracing the gun.\nCummings apparently came to Denver from Pampa, Texas, a small town northeast of Amarillo, where he ran Pampa Jiu-Jitsu Academy. Troy Schwiegerath, who also runs a martial arts studio in Pampa, said Cummings briefly trained at his studio before breaking off to open his own dojo.\nSoon after, Schwiegerath says Cummings began bad-mouthing him. Cummings then began posting Islamic teachings at his academy and on Facebook, according to Schwiegerath, eventually going around to the churches in town and saying they should be teaching from the Koran.\n“This dude was just straight-up crazy,” said Schwiegerath, who splits his time between Texas and Denver, where he works as a firefighter. “It got to the point where I told everybody not to have any contact with him whatsoever. I actually had an armed security guard at the door because I was so afraid because of how radicalized he got that he was going to come into the dojo and shoot it up.”\nSchwiegerath said eventually law enforcement began tracking Cummings. A Pampa police sergeant Wednesday night declined to comment and directed questions about Cummings to the FBI’s bureau in Dallas. A Dallas FBI spokeswoman referred questions about Cummings to Denver police.\n“Wake up, people,” Cummings said in a June 2016 post on Twitter . “America is a failed state. It’s about to get so real.”\nIn a posting the next month, he said an Arizona police officer accused of brutality should be put to death for treason .\nDenver investigators say the shooting was unprovoked as far as they know. White, however, said that detectives will also investigate whether the suspect shot Von Lanken for a personal reason.\nWhite said there is no reason to believe Cummings had an accomplice. Denver police issued a warning Wednesday to all of its officers because of the nature of the shooting.\n“We did ask officers to be vigilant,” White said. “We’re not 100 percent sure what motivated this individual.”\nThe killing had an immediate and profound impact on RTD officers and employees, RTD police Chief John Tarbert said. “It’s affecting everybody, even though he wasn’t a police officer.”\nVon Lanken worked as a police officer in Wisconsin from 1978 to 1987, according to his Facebook page. He then began his career as a pastor in 1988. In 2002, he moved to Loveland and continued to preach.\nHe and his wife, Shellie, have twin adult daughters, Crystal and Cassie.\nUpdate: #DPD investigators on scene at 16th & Wyncoop conducting active death investigation.\n— Denver Police Dept.

The company intends to make a contribution in honor of the family to show our unwavering support. We ask that you join with us in keeping our fallen comrade’s family in your thoughts and prayers.”\nThe killing also left colleagues shocked.\n“I feel anger, sadness and confusion as to why such an exemplary human being was so cowardly gunned down while doing his job,” Cole Peterson, an Allied employee who patrols for RTD in the Civic Center area, wrote in a post on Facebook. He gave The Denver Post permission to quote from his post.\n“Officer Von Lanken was the consummate professional and one hell of a nice guy,” Peterson said, “and he will be sorely missed by anyone who was lucky enough to cross paths with him.”\n \nSteve Nehf, The Denver Post A flag flew at half staff near the scene of the homicide on Feb. 1, 2017.
