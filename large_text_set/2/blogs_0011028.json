A&Es have an average waiting time of 14 hours. \nAnd 60,000 people wait on trolleys for up to 12 hours to get a bed. \nThese aren’t just statistics. \nThey’re your frightened grandmother spending weeks on end in hospital because they can’t find her a place in a care home. \nThey’re your little lad propped between two plastic chairs because the beds are full. And it’s our shattered doctors and nurses crying with frustration at the end of a 12-hour shift because this never ends. \nThis isn’t a war zone. Or an ­impoverished African county. This is the fifth richest nation on Earth. Time and again we said you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS. That wasn’t a soundbite. It was a statement of fact. Read More Now Jeremy Hunt has admitted there's an NHS crisis, let's have some cash to solve it For A&E departments to have an average waiting time of 14 hours is unacceptable (Photo: Getty) \nI’m old enough to remember the time before the NHS. One of my earliest memories is of my mum having to scrape together the cash to pay for a doctor’s visit when I was ill. \nBut in 1948 the Labour Government, against great opposition from the medical establishment and the Tories, created the National Health Service. It was founded on a revolutionary concept. Medical treatment based on need, not your ability to pay. \nTen years later, my youngest brother was born with a hare lip and cleft palate. It required ­countless operations. He was in and out of hospital for 20 years. And it didn’t cost us a penny. \nIt brought home to me how lucky my brother was when, as a steward on a cruise liner, I saw one of my wealthy American ­passengers. He had a son with a disfigurement associated with harelip and cleft palate. \nI asked the man why his son never had the operations my brother had. With sadness in his eyes, he replied that he never had the money at the time.

I have diabetes which requires regular visits to health clinics. \nThe crisis in our NHS is being ­exacerbated by my generation. While I remain active, elderly people are living longer, have more complex conditions and need more care. \nBut adult social care isn’t part of the NHS. That falls to cash-strapped councils which, since 2010, have seen the Tories cut their adult social care budgets by £4.6billion. \nCare homes used to be owned and run by the council. Now they’re mostly privately run. But the cuts have made them uneconomic. \nSince 2010, 380 care home businesses have been declared insolvent. It’s scandalous that 1.2 million people are not getting the social care they need. \nAnd it’s even worse that the Government was caught out offering a social care “sweetheart deal” to Surrey – the wealthiest Tory council in England. \nWe must create a National Care Service where care is given based on need and not your ability to pay. And that means all parties sitting down to work out a long-term way of funding it. Yes, it’ll mean paying more tax. But that’s the proper way to look after people who need it.

The Mirror revealed that in spite of our ageing population and increasing cost of treatment, NHS funding is growing at the lowest rate since records began in 1955. \nAs a percentage of our national wealth, we now spend less than the European average on health care. \nUnder Labour we met that average. Now France and Germany pay 10 per cent more than the UK. \nWhen Labour came to power in 1997, people had to wait 18 months for an operation. \nWe cut it down to 18 weeks. That required huge investment and more doctors and nurses. \nThe Tories and their Health ­Secretary Jeremy Hunt caused this crisis. We face a £22billion black hole in NHS funding and a further ­£2billlion in social care. \nHunt says there must now be change in the NHS. \nHere are two things they can change straightaway: Cancel the £70billion corporate tax cuts the Tories are giving to big business and millionaires. And sack that useless Hunt – with immediate effect.
