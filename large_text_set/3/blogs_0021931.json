So quiet in fact, they actually have not even had any potential free agents visit with the team SportsRadio 610 has learned. \nThe Texans remain the only team in the NFL that has yet to sign any free agent that was not on their roster in 2016. The only resigned players the Texans retained were punter Shane Lechler, kicker Nick Novak and tight end Ryan Griffin . They have seen LB John Simon , CB A.J. Bouye & offensive lineman Oday Abushi all sign elsewhere. They also traded away quarterback Brock Osweiler . \nThe Texans are supposed to be in the running for Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, but despite thoughts that he would be released and a free agent already, Romo is still on the Cowboys roster. Now 12 days into the free agency period the Texans have not even visited with any players to potentially sign for the 2017 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T18:02:17.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
