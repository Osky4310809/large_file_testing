Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nAdelaide Crows \nErin Phillips. The two-time Olympic basketballer hasn’t played much footy but should bring plenty of X-factor after stints as a point guard for the Opals and several WNBA teams. Will play mostly as a forward. \nBrisbane Lions \nTayla Harris. The 19-year-old is renowned for taking spectacular hangers and has a unique kicking style in which her boot winds up almost in line with her head. Expect her to build up an impressive highlights reel. \nCarlton \nBrianna Davey. The former Matildas goalkeeper is no stranger to elite competition, debuting for Melbourne Victory in the W-League at 15 and earning her first international cap a year later. A marquee pick and talented on-baller. \nCollingwood \nMoana Hope. The competition’s most recognisable player, Hope booted six goals in last year’s women’s All-Star game before handing AFL supremo Gillon McLachlan a ‘dabbing’ lesson. No surprise the nation’s biggest sporting team snapped up the tattooed forward. \nFremantle \nKara Donnellan. Donnellan’s comparisons to former West Coast and Carlton superstar Chris Judd in the way she plays have ensured plenty of fans will be keen to see the Dockers captain in action. A prolific ball-winner. \nGWS Giants \nNicola Barr. The No. 1 draft pick is a rising star of the game. A junior soccer player, Barr was late to footy but has developed into an elite midfielder. \nMelbourne \nDaisy Pearce. A gun on-baller, Pearce took out the inaugural VFL women’s best-and-fairest award last year. The former midwife is a leading ambassador for women’s footy and will captain the Demons. \nWestern Bulldogs \nKatie Brennan. The athletic key forward booted 150 goals in the past three women’s VFL seasons.
