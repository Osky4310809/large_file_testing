Lerma/EATX Step Inside Spicewood’s Inviting New Pizzeria Apis’ spin-off Pizzeria Sorellina opens today share Apis Restaurant and Apiary’s new on-site Pizzeria Sorellina is opening on Wednesday, January 18 along Highway 71. The casual spot brought forth by chef-owner Taylor Hall and chef Adam Brick will specialize in traditional Italian pizzas, salads and small plates featuring wild boar salumi. The menu features customizable and signature wood-fired pies such as Manilla Clam, Roasted Fennel, and Maitake Mushroom, and salads such as fried cauliflower and a take on the Caesar salad with warm escarole. The six cured meat-based small plates include Culatello (lightly-smoked boneless prosciutto) and Finocchiona (with dried orange and fennel seed). Hazelnut ice cream and a ricotta tart anchor the dessert menu. Beer, wine and draft cocktails will be available too. The kitchen will mill its own grains, shape and stretch the cheeses, and cultivate, process, cure and age the wild boar salumi onsite. The dough is made daily using a 10-year-old sourdough starter combining rye, freshly-milled red wheat, and Italian pizza flour from Naples, Italy. The restaurant also looks locally for ingredients; the wild boar meat is sourced from the Hapgood Ranch in Clay County while the grains are from Barton Springs Mill. With the goal of being a gathering spot, Sorellina features wide spaces and large communal tables. The open kitchen makes it easier to see all the pies in the custom-made wood-fired oven. Pizzeria Sorellina’s hours are 5 to 9 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, until 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, and from noon to 8 p.m. on Sundays. It’s closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:55:59.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
