Reuters Wimbledon players celebrate after the 2-0 win over bitter rivals Milton Keynes Rex Features 7 It was the first time the game had been played in London since the club was franchised \nSince being formed in 2002, when the Football Association controversially allowed the franchise of Wimbledon FC to Milton Keynes, the south London side had never hosted this explosive fixture. \nPolice number were boosted from the usual 20 to around 150 for the grudge match with the game receiving the highest-priority billing by the Met. \nKeep up to date with ALL the EFL news, gossip, transfers and goals plus fixtures, results and live match commentary \nVisiting fans were only allowed in if they had made the journey south on the official supporters’ coaches. \nAnd even then they were forced to walk the last 500 yards under a heavy police presence to avoid coming into contact with the home fans. \nDespite the safety warnings, MK Dons chairman Pete Winkelman, who masterminded the move from Wimbledon to Milton Keynes, did attend the game.

Reuters Jake Reeves celebrates after the second goal at Kingsmeadow Reuters 7 The Met police gave the game top priority – with 150 officers compared to the usual 20 \nBut as they failed to make the most of their chances, Milton Keynes started to find a foot in the game. \nAnd Harvey Barnes’ shot forced an excellent save from AFC Wimbledon keeper James Shea to keep the scores level. \nAfter the restart, Taylor’s cross-cum-shot almost squeezed in at the near post, forcing Martin to make a smart save. Jon Meads then shot wide from the resulting corner. Reuters Wimbledon didn’t put ‘Dons’ on the scoreboard \nMilton Keynes eventually crumbled under the pressure when Reeves first the Dons ahead on 61 minutes. \nTaylor’s cross from the right was headed back across goal by Andy Bircham and Reeves slammed home through a crowd of players. \nTaylor doubled the Dons’ lead nine minutes later when he latched on to kick thrown and raced forward before firing a low shot past Martin. \nThe two goal deficit prompted the best spell from Milton Keynes as Kieran Agard and Ed Upson both drew saves from Shea.

There was a lot of build up for the game and everyone has been talking about it for a long time. \n“We had the better chances in the first half, but they came out and scored the first goal and it turned the game.” Goals of the Week : Watch the finest Premier League strikes from the Weekend’s fixtures", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T06:06:17.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
