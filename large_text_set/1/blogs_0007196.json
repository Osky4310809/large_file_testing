January 10, 2017, 12:30 PM Luke Fox January 10, 2017, 12:30 PM \nThe Toronto Maple Leafs claimed goaltender Curtis McElhinney off waivers from the Columbus Blue Jackets Tuesday. \nA journeyman backup, McElhinney has seen limited work this season behind all-star Sergei Bobrovsky. \nThe 33-year-old has gone 2-1-2 with a .924 save percentage and 2.39 goals-against average. \nColumbus recalled prospect Anton Forsberg, 24, from Cleveland Monday to take over the backup role. Forsberg has shone in the AHL, going 12-6-1 with a .930 save percentage. #CBJ waived Curtis McIlhenney and now Sergei Bobrovsky is sick. Team says Anton Forsberg starts tonight, backed up by Joonas Korpisalo. \n— Stephen Whyno (@SWhyno) January 10, 2017 \nSnatching the London-born McElhinney is a low-risk move for Toronto, which is leaning heavily on No. 1 goalie Frederik Andersen. \nMcElhinney turns UFA on July 1 and carries a modest $800,000 cap hit. Here's a fun thought. Leafs play 2/15 in Columbus second game of b2b. We could see McElhinney vs. Bobrovsky in theory. #CBJ \n— Mark Scheig (@THWMark) January 10, 2017 \n— \nThe new Leaf was not the only backup to hit Monday's waiver wire. Edmonton Oilers goaltender Jonas Gustavsson cleared waivers Tuesday. \nThe Oilers' chance on the 32-year-old Gustavsson, who posted a winning record with Boston in 2015-16, has not panned out. \nThe Monster has started five of the Oilers' 42 games, posting a dismal 1-3-1 record and a save percentage of .878. \nEdmonton is expected to call up Laurent Brossoit, 23, from Bakersfield to support No. 1 netminder Cam Talbot. \n— \nCarolina Hurricanes forward Andrej Nestrasil cleared waivers Tuesday and will be sent down to AHL Charlotte. \nThe 25-year-old scored just one goal and registered five points in 18 appearances with the Hurricanes this season. He's only squeezed into the lineup twice since Dec. 10, and his demotion to Charlotte likely means forward Elias Lindholm, out of the lineup with an upper-body injury since Dec. 31, is returning to action. \n— \nIn other waiver news, Buffalo Sabres centre Derek Grant was placed on waivers Tuesday. He has no goals and three assists in 35 games this season. %2Fhockey%2Fnhl%2Fwaiver-watch-curtis-mcelhinney-jonas-gustavsson-nestrasil-blue-jackets-edmonton-oilers-hurricanes%2F", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-11T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-10T19:50:18.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
