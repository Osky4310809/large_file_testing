An exclusive study reveals some surprising results... \nThe appeal of football to many is in its simplicity. A ball, two goals, players and of course a referee. It's a role few envy, but without a referee, often chaos would ensue. Indeed, there would be no game. \nWhatever level of football is played, whether by men, women or children, a referee is there to ensure a fair contest. They are the enforcers of the laws, and the spirit of the game suggests the referee should be afforded the respect of players and supporters alike. Sky Sports have been focusing on the challenges faced by referees and officials in football. An exclusive survey has been commissioned to gauge views... \nThe Premier League is officiated by the best of the best - 18 professional Select Group referees, managed by the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd. The PGMOL was formed in 2001 to improve the standard of refereeing and the criteria and training is rigorous. They meet for a training camp twice a month, where they perform physical and technical sessions, and analyse match video. \nThere is also a system for measuring Select Group performance over the season. Each Premier League match is evaluated by a former senior referee, who scrutinises every decision using match footage and ProZone to measure officials' technical performance. Former players and managers assess the accuracy and consistency of decision making and their management of the match. So all in all, every decision, every inch of performance, is scrutinised. Referee Andre Marriner is one of the Premier League's top officials \nMistakes can be made, though. Referees do get decisions wrong. They are human. However, considering the pace of the game, the speed of some of the contact and the not-always-perfect behaviour of the players, the performances of the referees in the Premier League isn't at all bad, wouldn't you agree? \nWell, in an exclusive poll compiled by Sky Data, the question was asked to 1,086 people: How would you rate the standard of referees in the Premier League? \nMore than three-quarters rated the standard of Premier League referees as good, while just 12 per cent said it was bad. How would you rate the standard of referees in the Premier League?
