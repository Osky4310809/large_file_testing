Carlson followed up tonight by saying the White House is handling this poorly because there is a very real discussion to be had here about electronic communications of Trump advisers likely being swept up by intelligence agencies, and the way Trump and people in his orbit are responding isn’t helping. \nKrauthammer said, “It makes you question the credibility of the president on anything.” \nHe told Carlson “there’s not a person in Washington who thinks that there actually was a wiretap, that this is true,” and even went so far as to say that Trump “seems to have a belief in conspiracy theories.” \nKrauthammer did add that there’s also no evidence yet of Russian collusion with Team Trump, pointing specifically to statements from two former intel chiefs . \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:11:08.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
