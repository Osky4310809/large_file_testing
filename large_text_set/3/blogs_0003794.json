It’s not necessarily a result of increased demand in the number of clients eligible for citizenship but simply that more are interested in securing their status, said managing attorney Sarah Bertozzi . Jennifer Metzger Kimura of Legal Aid Bureau, left, and Sarah Bertozzi of Journey’s End… more Mike Petro “People are afraid to have refugee or green-card status right now and want to advance their citizenship to secure their status and place in the United States,” she said. Many hold green cards — part of the immigration process of becoming a permanent resident — and are not in danger of being removed from the country but there is still a fear of the unknown, according to Jessica Lazarin , deputy corporation counsel for the city of Buffalo and director of the local Office of New Americans. President Donald Trump ’s executive order on immigration that bans individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries caused shock waves throughout the nation and world. It hit home in communities such as Buffalo where there are refugees and immigrants who have yet to go through the naturalization process. Several federal judges blocked the executive order due to lack of evidence that immigrants from the seven countries engaged in terrorist acts in the United States, but the mere threat of it continues to have an impact. Trump was expected to sign a new refugee and immigration executive order last week. “The feeling is that citizenship is the best protection against removal,” Lazarin said. “If they’re ready for citizenship and eligible for it, there’s no reason to wait.” The need for legal representation for refugees and asylees seeking citizenship led Journey’s End to collaborate with other local organizations to find pro bono volunteers to help. One such effort will be a March 13 training and CLE session on completing applications for naturalization for eligible refugees, asylees and other low-income immigrants. Training will be offered to attorneys who also commit to volunteering at a pro bono citizenship drive on March 29. Both events will be at Journey’s End in the Tri-Main Center at 2495 Main St. The response has been overwhelming, with the training and citizenship drive now full. Those still interested in helping can get on a waiting list or inquire to the agency about attending future training and citizenship drives. “We just wanted that commitment from our volunteers to make sure it really benefited our clients,” Bertozzi said. She’s hoping they will chip away at a long list of clients eyeing citizenship. A waiting list had to be implemented in 2015 because demand was too great for the five staff attorneys at Journey’s End. The agency hosts a walk-in clinic once a week on Friday mornings to help people complete citizenship applications, but for those who cannot do this on their own, they go on the waiting list so that the nonprofit can represent them when time permits. “Particularly in the past six weeks, demand has increased so the organization is flooded right now,” Bertozzi said. Lazarin said the Office of New Americans, a sponsor of the upcoming training and citizenship drive, is trying to strengthen these types of initiatives to help such agencies as Journey’s End, Jericho Road Community Health Center and more. Last month, Jericho Road hosted a town hall in Buffalo for immigrants and refugees where attorneys and community leaders explained their rights. She said the city is looking to become part of a national initiative called City for Citizenship, which could lead to Buffalo taking on more formalized programs aimed at increasing citizenship among eligible U.S. permanent residents. “When someone is applying for citizenship, they’re not facing removal and are not in trouble, so it is hard for legal service agencies to make it a priority because they are dealing with other matters that are emergency cases. It takes a back seat,” Lazarin said. “We want to alleviate the backlog that some of these agencies and attorneys have. It could be a really positive way for the city to contribute.” Jennifer Metzger Kimura , a staff attorney at Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, said that since immigration is such a specialized area, training sessions offer attorneys a chance to familiarize themselves with this type of law. Training is open to attorneys without immigration experience, she said. Legal Aid Bureau also is collaborating on this effort. “I think what is scary now is the uncertainty of everything that is going on,” Kimura said. “Our agencies are going to try to band together and really unite, and if we can get more people actively involved, it can only help our community.” The training includes familiarizing attorneys with the completion of the application for naturalization so that they can go through the form with a client and explain the terminology or concepts and the background of the questions on the form. They’re also trained to help clients prepare for interviews with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services after an application is submitted. Journey’s End does the groundwork to make sure clients are pre-screened and are considered eligible. “It’s a need,” Kimura said, “and if we can help facilitate providing attorneys to help in this process, I think it’s really important.” More complicated immigration matters are not given to volunteer attorneys, according to Lazarin. She said the refugee population in the city has had miminal problems with criminal convictions or arrests that could hinder the citizenship process. “The population that’s here locally is really well-suited for the naturalization process,” she said. Following the election of Trump in November, Kimura said a group of attorneys at Legal Aid Bureau met with Executive Director David Schopp to discuss what could be done about impending issues due to the policies of the new administration. Kimura ended up reaching out to Bertozzi about ways that the agencies could combine efforts on immigration matters. They have been working since December on the training session and citizenship drive. While the Legal Aid Bureau does not take immigration cases, they’re issues that can still have an impact on the agency’s clients. “We thought it was a way to come together as a community, especially the legal community, and see what we could do,” Kimura said. “We’re just individuals and small voices here, but bringing in the community can actually make our voices louder and bring about some change. We knew that there was a need and people who wanted to help.” Journey’s End is funded through the state’s Office of New Americans and is the Upstate region provider. The agency does community outreach such as citizenship drives, primarily in Buffalo and Rochester, and helps to resettle approximately 500 individuals each year. Bertozzi said Journey’s End is always looking for volunteers to help eligible clients ready for naturalization. She added life can get in the way of applying for citizenship right at the five-year mark, when an individual becomes eligible, but its importance has became apparent as some of these people struggle to re-enter the country since the president’s executive order. “When Jenna reached out to me, it was a natural fit,” she said. “I have this group of passionate attorneys who want to help the community during this time and we have the clients. It was a really good partnership.” Family-reunification petitions are on the rise, too, according to Bertozzi. There is heightened demand for individuals applying to bring relatives from overseas because “nobody knows for how long the (border) doors will be open,” she said, adding any reopening remains temporary. Kimura expects more citizenship drives in the coming months in an effort to pare down the waiting list at agencies such as Journey’s End. She said attorneys expressed interest in helping immediately after the executive order. Said Lazarin: “It’s really rewarding work.” Michael Petro is editor and reporter for the Buffalo Law Journal Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T21:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T16:34:31.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
