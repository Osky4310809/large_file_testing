(@BCSO1) March 28, 2017 \n“To have chosen consciously to violate her oath and put more interest in protecting illegals, potentially criminal illegals, and certainly criminal illegals if ICEÂ were involved in this initiative, over the safety of her citizens that put her there, she needs to step down,” he added. \nState Rep. Michelle DuBoisÂ said she heard a rumor of a raid and simply went to pass the message along.   \nâICE raid in Brockton (MA) on 3/28 and 29th,” she posted. \nShe then added what she said was a message received from a friend in the Latin community. \n“I have a message for the immigrant community of Brockton,” the message read. “Please be careful on Wednesday 29. ICE will be in Brockton on that day.Â If you are undocumented donât go out on the street. If there is a knock on the door of your house and you donât know who it is, donât open the door. I ask you to be careful.â Michelle DuBois ( @RepDuBois ) warns illegal immigrants that @ICEgov may be conducting raids in Brockton, Mass. She needs to step down. pic.twitter.com/oLruF2JI1V \n— Based Vet đşđ¸ (@BasedVet) March 29, 2017   \nDuBoisÂ also shared a phone number for illegal immigrants to use if they are detained, and a set of tips for how to cope with ICE agents if they seek admittance. \nMassachusetts Republican Party ChairmanÂ Kirsten Hughes was among those who criticized the posts. \nâRep. DuBois has demonstrated a complete disregard for her constituentsâ safety, and she should be ashamed of these reckless comments,â she told The Daily Caller . \nDuBois, however, said she was only repeating the word on the street. \n“There are many people in Brockton (documented and not) as well as people across this nation who are terrified,” she said in a statement. “This rumor of an ICE raid in Brockton was widespread in Brockton. There have been many ICE raids in the city.” \n“Passing information along that is already all over the communityÂ not only lets the people I represent know what is happening, it lets ICE know that everyone in Brockton is aware of ICEâs planned raid (if there was one),” she said, adding that alerting ICE to the fact everyone knew they were coming simply allowed the agency to change the date of any raid.
