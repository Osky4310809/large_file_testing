And now, the studio released a first look at Blunt in the title role. In the photo, which is quite mysterious, we see Blunt's Mary in a striking blue jacket and a pink hat, adorned with a bird. Entertainment Weekly notes that we see a completely new version of her bottomless bag. The costumes were designed by Sandy Powell, who also worked on the recent live-action Cinderella. Most Popular It looks like Mary is on Cherry Tree Lane, right where she first entered the lives of the Banks family. The movie, based on other books from author P.L. Travers, is set 20 years after the events of the original movie, and takes place in London during the Great Depression. The Banks kids are grown up, but they need Mary more than ever. Though we don't know many details yet, we do know that Mary Poppins Returns features an incredible cast. Along with Blunt is Lin-Manuel Miranda, who plays a lamplighter named Jack, Meryl Streep as Mary Poppins' cousin, and Colin Firth as William Weatherall Wilkins, the legendary Angela Lansbury as a balloon vendor, and even a cameo from Dick Van Dyke. It's going to be a jolly holiday indeed. More from ELLE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T00:13:59.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
