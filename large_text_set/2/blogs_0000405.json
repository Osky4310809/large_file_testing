Per Mattias Karen of ESPN FC, Wenger also spoke of his pursuit of Mbappe and the 18-year-old's reluctance to leave Ligue 1: Mattias Karén @MattiasKaren Wenger said he was interested in signing Monaco's Mbappe last season, \"but he decided to stay where he was.\" 2/3/2017, 9:20:05 AM The Arsenal manager believes the Blues' position at the top of the table — as well as that of Kante's former club, Leicester City , who are in 16th — has a lot to do with the midfielder. \"I believe Kante has had a huge impact,\" Wenger noted . \"It's no coincidence Chelsea are where they are and Leicester did what they did last season.\" Another midfielder discussed at the press conference was former Chelsea star Frank Lampard , who announced his retirement from football on Thursday. Lampard announced his retirement on Thursday. Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images As the Blues' all-time top scorer, there were plenty of times when Lampard tormented the north London club. However, Wenger said he has a lot of respect for the former England international and considers him as one of the finest players of his generation: Mattias Karén @MattiasKaren Wenger on where he'd rank Lampard: \"Among the top, top, top.

Chelsea, after all, have taken 46 points from the past possible 51 in the Premier League and will feel another big stride can be taken toward the title here. Arsenal have not won at Stamford Bridge since 2011 or even scored a goal there since 2013. Those making the trip across the capital on Saturday will want to see those poor records improved and for the Gunners to give themselves, and the rest of the chasing pack, a lifeline in pursuit of top spot.
