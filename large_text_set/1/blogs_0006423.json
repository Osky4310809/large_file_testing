Huckabee copied me.” \n“Millions of people voted for him on the belief that he would keep his word,” Sanders said. \nThe GOP has already begun speaking to the press about their plans to unravel the ACA over the coming weeks and months and have even voted to make it easier for them to do so without resistance from Democrats. \nYou can see all of Sanders’ remarks below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T01:25:39.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
