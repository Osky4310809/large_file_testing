In the book, Jacob wants to wear a dress to school. \nA reasonable-minded teacher brought her concerns to CMS member, Rhonda Lennon, but amazingly, the school board didn’t even know about the book. (Or so they claimed.) \nLennon said, “I think there are ways that we could have incorporated that kind of communication and that type of a curriculum with our students to make sure people are treating everybody respectfully without really going that far and it just feels like we went too far.” \nYeah, I’d say. \nI also found it strange how CMS Superintendent Ann Clark described a book that is clearly agenda-driven as focusing “on valuing uniqueness and difference.” Um, no. It’s about a boy that wants to dress like a girl. Big difference. \nThen there was Equality NC’s executive director Chris Sgro who doesn’t seem to have a problem with first graders tackling such a controversial topic. \n“All students deserve to have their experiences represented in the curriculum taught to them, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity, ability and class,” he said. But first graders, Chris? Really? \nSrgo also said with no hint of irony, “It’s sad that some are unwilling to allow students this opportunity and seem to stop at nothing to push their extreme views about LGBTQ people on children at any cost.” Pot, meet kettle. \nOne voice of reason put it succinctly: Tami Fitzgerald of N.C. Values Coalition: \n“The purpose of our elementary schools is to teach writing, reading and arithmetic, not to encourage boys to wear dresses. CMS is failing our children.” \nSo, while this it is a victory that Jacob’s New Dress won’t be read to 6 and 7 year olds, wait until you hear what book they WILL be reading from. \nClick CONTINUE to find out:  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-24T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-24T04:15:42.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
