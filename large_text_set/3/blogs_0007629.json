Not only did Nicki take her time to think out her responses, but she enlisted the help of her Young Money brethren (and experienced rap beef champion) Drake and Lil Wayne…to make sure it’s sometjing that sticks. Wonder where she learned that method from .\nNicki’s response isn’t quite as heavy on the vitriol…but there’s definitely some vaginal insults, some attacks on Remy’s looks and mention of her own body surgery, some mention of lack of sales, etc. There’s no question on who she’s speaking to on this one. \nAnywho…take a listen:\nYikes. She called Remy Shanaynay though? That just stuck out…\nHit the flip for more…\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-10T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-10T07:15:50.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
