Number one, do you think that's a mental illness, narcissism, and if so is he fit to be president?”\nMcGraw, the host of the popular daytime show Dr. Phil, joked that he objected to the compound question. He then read off a list of attributes possessed by narcissists, which Behar checked off as all appropriate to describe Trump.\nNewsbusters provided a transcript:\nDR. PHIL: So, I brought a list from the DSM5 about what narcissism really is. If I ask people to stand up and define it they wouldn't know. Let's just take a vote. One, has a grandiose sense of self-importance.\nBEHAR: Check.\nDR. PHIL: Two, is preoccupied with fantasies of success power or brilliance. Which she said. OK. Three, believes that he or she is special or unique.\nBEHAR: Check, check!\nDR. PHIL: Can only be understood by special people.\nBEHAR: Ivanka.\nDR. PHIL: Four, requires excessive admiration.\nBEHAR: Oh, check, check, check, check.\nDR. PHIL: Has a sense of entitlement, which means is very thin-skinned.\nBEHAR: Oh, check, check, check, check.\nDR. PHIL: Is interpersonally exploitive—\nBEHAR: Check.\nDR. PHIL: Lacks empathy, has the inability to stand in other people's shoes.\nBEHAR: You know like when he makes fun of how people who are handicapped or disabled—\nDR. PHIL: I'm just reading it. You interpret it however you want. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her. Shows arrogant and haughty behavior.\nBEHAR: Case closed.\nWhile McGraw acknowledged those characteristics could apply to many people, including some at The View's table, a number of the attributes had to be shown for a lengthy period of time and be “disruptive to your functioning” to indicate true narcissism.\nWhen he added that every president likely had suffered some kind of mental or emotional imbalance at some point in their lives, Behar snapped that President Obama could never be considered to have narcissistic disorder.\n“I didn't say they all have it,” he replied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:26:31.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
