The raunchy regenerative mutant may have had a funny obsession with Hugh Jackman on-screen, but the hero’s actor has taken the interest beyond fiction. Ryan Reynolds has made it very clear he wants to see Deadpool and Wolverine team up, but Hugh Jackman has been less-than-forthcoming about the opportunity. When rumors suggested the two heroes would encounter each other in Logan , the stars were quick to shoot down the reports. And, now, Jackman is making it clear his version of Wolverine won’t suit up with Deadpool at any point. \nToday, Jackman took part in a live Q&A for Logan alongside director James Mangold and co-star Patrick Stewart. It was there that Jackman answered a question about if he was willing to team-up with Deadpool. And, at first, the leading man pretended as if he hadn’t heard the suggestion before. \n“I’ve not heard that one. Deadpool is the other mutant?” Jackman joked before Mangold chimed in with this zinger: “It’s Green Lantern in a different outfit.” \nAfter a moment, Jackman then addressed the fan’s question, and said he may have thought over the collaboration years ago. \n“Look, if that movie had appeared ten years ago, it’d be a totally different story. But I knew 2.5 years ago that this was the last one. The first call I made was to Jim [Mangold]. I said, ‘Jim, I got one more shot at this.’ As soon as I got with Jim and started working on the idea of it, I was never more excited. But it feels like the right time,” the actor said. \n“Deadpool, go for it, man. You do your thing. You don’t need me.” \nOf course, Reynolds may or may not like the Australian star’s word affect his campaign. Last year, the Deadpool star said he wasn’t sure how to convince his friend but that he’d keep trying to find a way. \nAre you excited to see Logan ? If so, let us know by giving the movie a rating with our Anticipation Rankings below! Currently, the movie is #4 on all of ComicBook. \nLogan takes place in the year 2029, where mutant births have become extremely rare. The defenders of mutant kind, the X-Men, are long gone, and the only remains of them are an old and struggling Charles Xavier and a weary Logan. Logan's vaunted healing factor has slowed, and at times doesn't seem to work at all. When a young mutant needs his help, Logan has to unsheathe his claws once more. His job isn't over yet. \nLogan stars Hugh Jackman (Logan), Boyd Holbrook (Donald Pierce), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier), Dafne Keen (Laura Kinney/X-23), Doris Morgado (Maria), Stephen Merchant (Caliban), Elizabeth Rodriguez (Gabriela), and Richard E. Grant (Dr. Zander Rice). James Mangold is directing and helped on the screenplay along with Scott Frank and Michael Green. \nLogan hits theaters on March 3, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:32:54.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
