According to international terrorism watchdog group Terror Monitor , the victim is an alleged “religious jurist” named Muhammad Tabsho. A young boy informs US that ISIS will \"destroy\" the rebel factions it supports in Syria, he then beheads the captive pic.twitter.com/M1gnUy4oxp \n— Jihad Threat Monitor (@memrijttm) February 4, 2016 \nTerror Monitor further reports that the boy executioner has been identified as the son of Abu Darda, who was killed by a United States airstrike in Aleppo, Syria. \nIn the video the boy executioner informs the U.S. in English that ISIS will “destroy” the rebel groups it supports in Syria, like the Levant Front. The Levant Front is a coalition of Aleppo-based Syrian Civil War rebel factions formed in December 2014. It is made up of Islamist and apolitical organizations all with the goal of overthrowing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. \nAddressing the United States further, the boy executioner says, “You can’t escape from coming on the ground. I wish I meet on you on the hills of Dabiq.” According to Islamic eschatology, Dabiq is where the Muslim version of Armageddon is prophesied to take place. ISIS is trying to draw the United States and its allies into a ground war at Dabiq to force the fulfillment of this prophecy. \nAccording to The Clarion Project, an extremist watchdog group, the prophecy states: \n…that the Romans will arrive at Dabiq and tell all the Muslims to stand aside so that they can fight only those Muslims who took the captives. The Muslims will then unite against the Romans. The Islamic State is hoping that this will come to fruition. \nWhen the battle begins, according to the prophecy, about one-third of the Muslim forces will flee (“whom Allah will never forgive”), one-third will die as “excellent martyrs” and the remaining one-third will win the battle and then conquer Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). \nIn this instance, the Romans are Americans and the “Muslims who took the captives” is the Islamic State. \nAfter referencing this eschatological foundation if Islamist ideology, the boy executioner beheads Muhammad Tabsho.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-15T15:17:03.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
