ADVERTISEMENT \nDrug addicts commit street crimes to support their vice. \nEliminating street criminals was the secret in Davao City, considered one of the safest in the world. \nHowever, as the number of petty criminals dropped, the number of criminal policemen remained the same. \nThe 300 or so rogue cops ordered sent to Basilan—only 50 cops reported on the day of the mass send-off—are just a speck in President Digong’s estimate that the bad eggs within the Philippine National Police make up “40 percent” of the force. \nIn Metro Manila, abusive cops have not mended their ways and still oppress civilians with impunity. \nFor example, PO1 Anthony Jaira Nepomuceno of the Manila Police District (MPD) shot and wounded Mark Anthony Agito, a pedicab driver, over a petty misunderstanding last month. \nNepomuceno, who was reportedly drunk, suspected Agito of tapping his car. \nShooting a man for tapping your car is the height of arrogance. \nNepomuceno has not been suspended despite facing criminal and administrative charges that my public service program, “Isumbong Mo kay Tulfo,” helped file. \nMy program, which started airing on Radio Veritas on June 1, 1991, has heard so many complaints about rogue cops. \nBut the most abusive cops I’ve come across were those at the MPD’s Sta. Mesa precinct. \nIf I would rate their abusive behavior, I would rate it “nine and a half” on a scale of one to ten, one being the lowest. \nHere are the names of the cops if the authorities would be interested: SPO1 Renato Ablaza, PO3 Ruel Aguilar, PO2 Patrick Guevarra and PO2 Ronald Robles. \nTheir victim was Michael Hingpit, a gay auto mechanic. \nMichael was in a taxicab with a male companion on their way to a motel when they were stopped by cops manning a checkpoint at the corner of V. Mapa and Peralta streets. \nThey took Michael and his boyfriend to the precinct even though they didn’t commit any wrongdoing. \nAt the station, Michael was threatened with a gun, slapped, struck with a ladle on the head and robbed of his wallet and cell phone. \nBut the worst indignity Michael suffered was being ordered to perform oral sex on his boyfriend; he refused to do it despite being slapped repeatedly, with a gun pointed at his head. \nNot content, one of Michael’s captors extorted coins from his sister who went to the station with a piggybank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:01:41.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
