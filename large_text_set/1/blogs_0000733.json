Beware the $52 TRILLION $USD Debt Bomb by Phoenix Capital... - Jan 2, 2017 2:24 PM \nGlobally over $52 TRILLION in debt is denominated in $USD. And Janet Yellen is talking about three rate hikes in 2017?!? Greece Unleashes 'Soft' Cash Ban Jan 3, 2017 9:19 AM 0 SHARES \nThe spread of global cash bans continues with Greece unveiling their so-called 'soft' approach by which taxpayers will only be granted tax-allowances or deductions when payments are made via credit or debit cards . As KeepTalkingGreeece reports, the new guidelines refer to employees, pensioners, farmers, and also the unemployed . \nAccepted expenditure will be: purchases for food and supermarket products, electronic and electric devices, household equipment, footwear, clothing, fuel, furniture, cigarettes, drinks Restaurants, cafeterias,bars and hotels Services like by hairdressers and beauty parlors, gyms and dance schools, car repair, plumbers, electricians, painters, carpenters, lawyers and accountants. For doctors and pharmacy the same practice will be valid as in last year. The tax office will accept the expenditure only if payments are made per credit card or bank transfer. Expenditure for utility bills, landlines and mobile phones, heating, rent, loan repayments that in fact swallow the largest amount of monthly expenditure for private households will not be accepted. Also not accepted is expenditure for toll and transport tickets. \nIn its “wisdom” the Greek Finance Ministry has determined the amount the taxpayers will have to pay with electronic money in order to be able to get the tax allowance: 10% for annual income up to €10,000 15% for annual income €10,001-€30,000 20% for annual income over €30,001 \nThe famous Greek wisdom in times of austerity, bailout agreements and economic crisis remains the same also in 2017 and as neoliberal as possible since 2010: crack the low and medium incomes, let the rich fly free \nFind the Surrealism income €7,000: expenditure per plastic money must be €700 income €10,000: expenditure per plastic money must be €1,000 income €30,000: expenditure per plastic money must be €4,500 income €60,000 expenditure per plastic money must be €12,000 \nShould a taxpayer not be able to spend the necessary percentage of the annual income according to the guidelines, the punishment will be a penalty of 22% imposed on the missing difference. \nI heard on television that couples will have to spend separately – but better check with your accountant. The average taxpayer in Greece needs an accountant anyway, someone who will follow the revenue-expedience balance month by month for the sake of the tax office. \nIn the bizarre Greek world we live in, households will be obliged to spend money even if they do not want to. As the large part of monthly need coverage (utilities etc) is not accepted by the tax office, households who do not manage to reach the necessary percentage through supermarket percentages will have to go and spend like crazy in retail, dance schools and gyms and other goods and service providers. \nExempted from the compulsory usage of credit/debit cards are seniors over 70 years old, residents of remote areas and people with disability over 80%. I suppose they will have to continue the collection of paper receipts. \nKTG understands that with these new system, taxpayers will not need to collect the stupid receipts from cash register, where the amount had faded away when they were supposed to be brought to the tax office in a huge plastic bag. \nThe cap for cash transactions falls from 1,500 until 31.12.2016 down to 500 euro. In simple words: any purchase of good and service over 500 euro will need to be done via plastic money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T16:34:47.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
