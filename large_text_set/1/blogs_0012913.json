( AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli ) Usually, when something ends up in a museum, it is expected to be treated with the utmost care. Unluckily for Craig Breedlove and his famed and historic Spirit of America turbojet car, this apparently wasn’t the case.\n\nAdvertisement \n\nBreedlove, who is 79 years old now, is famous for breaking many land-speed records in the 1960s with various turbojet-powered cars that he designed and built—all called Spirit of America. He was the first person to reach 500 MPH on land at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1964.\nAt the end of the run, however, the car ran out of room to slow down after it lost its parachutes and ended up crashing into a saltwater brine pool far away from the course. The Spirit of America was brought back to a race car facility in California, where it was repaired and modified in preparation for a 600 MPH record attempt the following year.\nAdvertisement \n\nBut the car never ran again, because the Museum of Science and Industry contacted Breedlove and requested him to loan the vehicle to it for an exhibition. The two parties made an oral agreement, with conditions of the loan being:\n\n(1) the Spirit of America would not be shown commercially anywhere other than at the Museum without Breedlove’s prior written approval; (2) the Spirit of America would be made available in the event that a motion picture about the record runs of the vehicle was going to be made; and (3) in the event that the Spirit of America was to be removed from exhibition, it would returned to Mr. Breedlove at his request.\nWhen it was returned to him in 2015, he discovered that it had been damaged, reports the Chicago Tribune .\nAccording to the lawsuit, the car was not in the “mint condition” that was stated in the museum’s letter that alerted Breedlove of its intention to return the car.
