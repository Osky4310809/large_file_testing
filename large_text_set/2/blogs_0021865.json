Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports \nMartellus Bennett enjoyed an extremely productive first season with the New England Patriots, and if the soon-to-be free agent tight end doesn’t return to New England, fellow tight end Rob Gronkowski hopes he leaves for a massive payday. \nGronkowski was at the Daytona 500 on Sunday, and the star tight end shared his thoughts on Bennett’s free agency with Drew Davison of the Star-Telegram. \n“I’m hoping he breaks the bank,” Gronkowski said per Davison. “Whenever you see a tight end break the bank, it’s good for the industry. It’s good for the position. You want to see the position grow. I want to see him do whatever he’s got to do, but I don’t make the calls.” \nBennett filled in admirably once Gronkowski went down with a season-ending knee injury. The veteran tight end caught 55 passes for 701 yards and a team-leading seven touchdowns while also excelling as a blocker. \nIf Bennett elects to re-sign, he will give the Pats a lethal dynamic duo at tight end, as well as injury insurance for Gronkowski. The alternative, however, appears to be the more likely scenario , as Bennett will be highly coveted as the top tight end on the free-agent market. \nFree agency officially begins March 9 at 4 p.m. ET. \n  NESN.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:34:40.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
