Mynt’s interests include a micro-payment service and a mobile loan service, areas that give it plenty in common with Ant Financial. Globe, meanwhile, is the Philippines’ largest operator with 66.6 million subscribers, that’s just over 50 percent marketshare. \nAnt Financial said it would technology to “upgrade” Mynt’s GCash service, while providing cash to help scale its financial products, which are aimed at helping under- and unbanked consumers. It claimed to currently have three million users. \nThe deal includes an investment from national firm Ayala Corporation which, together with Ant Financial, has taken a 45 percent stake in Mynt, according to local news . Globe owns the remainder of the venture. \nAnt Financial’s investments in Southeast Asia include Ascend Finance, a Bangkok-based business with a regional presence, and Singapore’s M-Daq . Elsewhere it is a shareholder in Paytm , India’s top mobile markets service which also runs an e-commerce business, and is in the process of acquiring U.S. payments firm MoneyGram for $880 million. \nThese moves are important because they indicate Alibaba’s expansion plans, which go beyond what it has done with its core e-commerce business. Indeed, Alipay and other Ant Financial services are seen as a gateway to introducing e-commerce and other businesses , while, in Southeast Asia, a broaden presence could bolster Lazada, which Alibaba acquired a major chunk of at a $2 billion valuation last year. Given that Ant Financial is the process of raising $3 billion to spend on M&A, and is drawing close to a much-anticipated IPO, expect to see plenty more deal flow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:48:59.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
