Change its blending mode to “Color Burn” with 20% opacity in the Transparency Panel (Shift + Ctrl+F10).\n\nClick image to enlarge Step 06. \nClick image to enlarge Next, draw another rectangle with 280px width and 178px height using #E9E3D9 fill color and white color stroke.

Make its copy, turn the backside copy white and drag it 1-2steps upwards.\nStep 17.  \nClick image to enlarge You can make as many buttons as you want by using the same technique. And make the shadow of icon the same way as explained in step 15.\nStep 18.  \nClick image to enlarge Now pick the Rounded Rectangle Tool, click the canvas to view options window and enter 210px width and 8px height here. Give it #404041 fill color and #F1F1F2 color stroke (Stroke weight: 1pt).\nStep 19. \nClick image to enlarge To make the paper, draw a rectangle with following dimensions and #F7F5E8 fill color.\nPick the Pen Tool (P) to draw a small line using any color as a stroke.
