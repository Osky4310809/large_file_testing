With an emotion-laden tenor and skilled backing band, Stevens tackles the biggest themes: discontent with contemporary society (“Where Do the Children Play?”), the search for meaning (“Miles from Nowhere,” “But I Might Die Tonight”), and lost love (“Wild World”). Tillerman became one of Stevens’ most popular albums because it spoke to an audience who craved something more from modern life. And it still does. Customer Reviews Tea for the Tillerman: Cat Stevens by mbcousins I ordered this album to give to my son, who is 24. I am a combat survivor from the \"conflict\" in Vietnam and I have continued to survive the 60's,70's,80's,90's and I am still here. This was a very important album to me because when I arrived back in the States off of River Patrol Boats I had already done some very serious combat at the age of 20 and I remember thinking, one time, when I was very stoned, \"If I ever have a son, I would want him to hear this album\" It is the kind of album that I lock in my heart. A constant favorite by jpcooldude2 I can't remeber a time when I didn't know every word to the songs on this album. It seems like my mom has been playing this these songs in the car for ever. There are so many good memories attached to this record for me. There is never more than a couple weeks were I don't go and listen to this album non-stop. As a teenager that might be a little weird, it doesn't exaclty fit in with most of the music that I listen to, but Cat Stevens is undisputably my favorite artist. Others come and go but Cat is a constant. Timeless by sherbet One of the best albums ever. I owned it on vinyl as a teenager, then on tape, then on CD, and now have downloaded it. I always come back to it.
