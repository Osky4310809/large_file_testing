Danny and his wife Jo were seen shopping together (Photo: ISIM JAHA) \nThe star had taken a hiatus from filming for the BBC soap following a drunken appearance at the National Television Awards in January. \n\"The producers are concerned about him for a number of reasons,\" a source revealed at the time. \n\"It was clear to onlookers he appeared very drunk at the NTAs. It is best that he takes some time out to sort his life out. He appears to be exhausted,\" they told The Sun. The EastEnders star carried two shopping bags on his trip (Photo: ISIM JAHA) It was the first time he was seen in public since returning from South Africa (Photo: ISIM JAHA) Danny is yet to return to the soap (Photo: ISIM JAHA) \nDanny's break is thought to be for a number of weeks while he looks after himself and gets back to full health. \nBut rumours started swirling last week that the Cockney geezer was already back on the EastEnders set, ready to start work again. \nHowever, an insider exclusively revealed that the reports were untrue. Reports that he was back on set were denied this week (Photo: ISIM JAHA) Danny's wife, Joanne (Photo: ISIM JAHA) \n\"Danny is not back on set,\" said our source. \n\"Any claims that he has returned to filming are false.\" \nIt was initially thought that EastEnders' producers could send Danny's character Mick to jail to explain his absence. \nBut now that Shirley has been packed off to prison instead, fans are wondering what Mick will do next. \nIn Tuesday's episode he was seen crying in bed and on the verge of a nervous breakdown - and producers have been teasing a dramatic climax to all his problems. Mick Carter was seen struggling with his emotions this week (Photo: BBC) \nMeanwhile, it's been revealed that the 'Enders cast are planning a big party for Danny when he eventually returns to the set. \n\"They're keen to show everyone is behind him 100 per cent after his tough few months,\" a source told the Daily Star. \n\"They are planning a round of applause when he steps back behind the bar for filming for the first time.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:56:58.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
