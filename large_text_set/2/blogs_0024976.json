The influential modernist built a row of 20 such homes in 1966, near the end of his life. \nOverlooking Beverly Glen Boulevard, the homes are suspended over a hillside in Sherman Oaks, supported mainly by a few long poles extending from the terrain below. The precarious-looking design was meant to incorporate the houses into the existing environment without extensively reshaping the landscape through excessive grading. So far, as the LA Times noted in 1998 , the homes have survived at least two nearby earthquakes without incident.\nThis particular two-bedroom home features stunning floor-to-ceiling windows that provide panoramic views across the surrounding hills. A wide deck accessed from the living area and master bedroom also capitalizes on the stellar views.\nOther features include updated bathrooms, built-in shelving and a walk-in closet in the second bedroom, and an open living room and dining area with hardwood floors and a large stone fireplace. \nThe 1,800-square-foot home is situated on a half-acre lot that includes a detached deck and front garden, as well as a two vehicle carport with a wooden gate. Asking price is $1.349 million.\n3737 Oakfield Drive [Carol Huston | Huston Group LA] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:39:25.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
