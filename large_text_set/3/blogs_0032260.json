Your next connected timepiece might have been revealed this week, as the Baselworld 2017 watch and jewelry show rages on in Switzerland. \nMany of the top watch brands are riding the resurgent wave of Android Wear 2.0 , debuting watches that run the gamut from minimal and affordable to bold and expensive, with a little bit of everything in between. And what's this about a Pocket Watch… from Samsung? \nThe show continues on into next week, but in case you can't hop a flight Basel to strap on the year's most enticing new smartwatches, we've got you covered: here are the seven standout devices from this year's show. 1) Samsung Pocket Watch \nSamsung's Gear S3 is undoubtedly the company's best smartwatch to date, but could it be even better without the straps? We ask because that's the exact idea Samsung showed off this week with its Pocket Watch concept, which blends the modern with the traditional. \nInside, you'll find the familiar Gear S3 screen and interface on one half, while the other houses a proper compass for more traditional navigation needs. And then when you close it up, there's also a standard watch face on the outside – in case your battery dies, we suppose. It hasn't committed to actually building this thing yet, but we do love it when Samsung gets a bit weird. 2) Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20S \nWe were impressed by our first hands-on with the standard Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 back in January, as the sporty watch packed a GPS and all the benefits of Android Wear 2.0. Now Casio is back with a limited edition model that makes an even better first impression. \nThe Pro Trek WSD-F20S model (mind the \"S\" at the end) swaps in a sleek black and blue aesthetic, complete with sapphire glass and semi-gloss coating. Otherwise, it's exactly the same on the inside, which is no complaint. Only 500 will be made, however, so this could be a tough one to snag for your wrist. Also Read How to master... Android Wear 2.0 3) Misfit Vapor \nThe Misfit Vapor is another watch that caught our eye back at CES, with its striking, minimal look, touch-sensitive bezel, and reasonably affordable US$200 (S$280) price point – and the deal just got sweetened at Baselworld this week. \nThat's because Misfit announced that the Vapor will run Android Wear 2.0 instead of the company's own OS, which will make it all the more functional thanks to access to the Play Store and other Android perks. It's still expected out this summer, and now we're all the more excited to strap one on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:10:46.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
