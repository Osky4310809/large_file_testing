Only about 11 percent said they could sleep through the night without waking up. \nMany respondents cited work pressure as a major influence on their sleep quality, and could lead to bad sleep. \nThe survey showed 60 percent of the respondents would choose to work instead of sleep. \nIn general, people with good education background tended to be more self-disciplined about getting enough sleep, but only 5 percent of respondents had a routine daily schedule. \nSleep problems have little direct link to income, working conditions or social status, according to the survey. \n\"The portion of people with bad sleep is almost the same in different social layers,\" the report stated. \nSurveyors said that stress, anxiety, and low spirits were the main culprits in bad sleep, worsened by the obsession with electronic products that could cause blue light effects disrupting sleep. \nSome 93 percent said they would play with smartphones before sleep, watching TV series or shopping online. \nSurveyors believed that the random life schedules would lead young Chinese people to have low work efficiency, low appetite, low sexual desire but higher cancer risk.
