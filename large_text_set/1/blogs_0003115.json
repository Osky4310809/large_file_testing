While there are plenty of strategy games out there, and plenty of games where people have to be dicks to each other, none walk the line between them as well as Fantasy Flight’s classic. Which can make it tough to get your head around. So I’m here to help.\nThis piece originally appeared 1/14/15. \n\nThe Terrific Game of Thrones Board Game is Full of Violence and Betrayal, Void of Sex The Terrific Game of Thrones Board Game is Full of Violence and Betrayal, Void of Sex The Terrific Game of Thrones Board Game is Full… Lies, bloodshed, betrayal! Power and influence, secrets and whispers, fragile alliances shattered… Read more Read more \nI’ve been playing the game for years now, and having won it a few times with each House (including those in the expansions), I’ve found a number of key tips to be useful regardless of who you’re playing as, or indeed who you’re playing against. \nAdvertisement \n\nAdvertisement \n\nNow, these won’t be guarantees that you’ll win every time - as much as strategy plays a part, even the best-laid plans in this game can come undone through sheer bad luck - but if you’re not winning, you’ll be coming damn close.\n\nHOUSE SELECTION The houses in the game are not balanced. I mean, technically they might be, but play the game enough times and you see that some have a smoother ride than others. If you’re playing with 4 players, the two “southern armies” - Baratheons and Lannisters - have a much easier time of it because they’re free to chase the empty garrisons in the bottom of the map. Conversely, in a six-player game, the Tyrells and Martells are more secure, especially if they can keep enemy navies off their coast.\nThe Starks tend to have a tougher time of it because they’re spread across the entire North, making them vulnerable. And the Greyjoys...well, look, if you want a hard time (or a satisfying win), use the Greyjoys. It’s brutal starting the game with no star tokens, and their place in the game’s “meat grinder”, where much of the main battles seem to take place (at least in the north), doesn’t help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:22:08.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
