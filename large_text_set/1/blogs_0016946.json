The megachain has announced that as of October 1, employees seeking maternity leave that work 20 hours a week or more can look forward to not only the six weeks off they currently have at 67% of their usual pay (federal law mandates a total of 12 weeks unpaid), but 18 weeks off at 100 %. Whoa. \nWhat’s more, they can choose to extend that time by an additional 12 weeks, though that time would be unpaid. \nAnd what about the men or non-birth mothers, you ask? (This week is all about gender equality, after all.) They’re covered too — even as adopted parents. \nDang! No wonder it’s been previously named one of the top 100 companies people want to work for! \nBravo, Starbucks. Bravo. \nWhat do you think of Starbucks’ new parental policy?
