At its closest point, it was 14 times the distance between the Earth and the moon. \nThe asteroid measures roughly 200m (660ft) wide and 400m (1,310ft) long. \nBut the American space agency has labelled it \"potentially hazardous\" and warned that it could one day strike the Earth. \nIt was captured on film by the Arecibo Observatory, a giant radio telescope , during its flyby of the Earth. The skyscraper-sized chunk of rock can be clearly seen tumbling through the blackness of space.

Within 10 minutes of spotting an incoming asteroid it can project potential flight paths. \nIt alerts three other telescopes to perform follow-up observations and narrow down a rock's trajectory. \n\"When a telescope first finds a moving object, all you know is it's just a dot, moving on the sky. You have no information about how far away it is,\" astronomer Paul Chodas from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which runs the Scout program, told NPR. \nAsteroid to fly between Earth and the Moon LIVE in fourth near miss of the year Asteroid flying between Earth and Moon (Photo: Getty) \n\"The more telescopes you get pointed at an object, the more data you get, and the more sure you are how big it is and which way it's headed. But sometimes you don't have a lot of time to make those observations.\" \nScout is designed to keep track of so-called \"Near Earth Objects\", and identify those that could potentially be on a collision course with Earth, so NASA can respond. poll loading Are you worried about an asteroid hitting the Earth? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T17:26:34.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
