Image copyright 10x Image caption The message received by commuters with the app. \nThe two apps work \"like walkie-talkies\" said Mr Leith. \nThey require the handset's bluetooth location services and notifications to be switched on and the app is currently only available for Apple devices. \n\"We should be using our eyes [instead] but if you look around you, everyone whips out their phone as soon as they sit down,\" said Mr Leith. \n\"When we did user testing quite a few women said that early on in pregnancy, when they are not showing, is when they feel most ill and need a seat the most. \n\"But visibly you can't see the bump and you can't always see the badge because the trains get so busy.\" Image copyright 10x Image caption An earlier badge prototype was abandoned because of production costs. \nThe National Childbirth Trust (NCT) expressed support. \n\"Anything that helps women with a 'baby on board' to have a more comfortable journey can only be a good thing,\" said senior policy adviser Elizabeth Duff. \nAnalyst Marina Koytcheva from CCS Insight said the firm had recognised a business opportunity. \n\"Travelling on public transport at rush hour is an arduous task at the best of times. When you are pregnant it is even more challenging,\" she said. \n\"It is amazing what technology can do today, but it is also hard to tell how many pregnant women will be willing to pay for the convenience of finding a seat.\" \nIn 2016 the South Korean city of Busan successfully trialled a scheme of pink buttons, attached to train carriages and activated via Bluetooth badges, to alert commuters to pregnant women requiring seats. \nIn London pregnant commuters can get a free \"Baby On Board\" pin badge from the Tube network.
