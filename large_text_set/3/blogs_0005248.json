There was Measure S, the controversial anti-development ballot measure, but also the mayor and City Council races, in which the incumbents were attacked, time and again, for allowing density in L.A. It's no exaggeration to say the election was a referendum on development, on density, on urbanization. And density won. \nOK, the establishment won. But those incumbents were forced to oppose Measure S and defend density, and they were all elected to another term without a runoff (with the possible exception of City Councilman Gil Cedillo, who has slightly more than 50 percent of the vote but may not after the late absentee ballots are counted). Many of them won with 30, 40 and 50-point margins of victory. Mayor Eric Garcetti was reelected with 81 percent of the vote, 73 points ahead of his nearest challenger, Mitchell Schwartz. \nAnd then there was Measure S itself. Many expected it to lose, but few imagined it to lose by so much. The initiative, which plastered the skyline with \"Yes on S\" billboards and flooded mailboxes with mailers (some of them quite scandalous ), was utterly eviscerated at the polls, losing by roughly 38 points. Measure N, the marijuana regulation initiative that had no campaign as was abandoned by its own sponsors, was more popular with voters than Measure S. \nIt was a stunning repudiation of slow-growth and anti-growth politics, currents of which had enjoyed widespread popularity in L.A. for nearly half a century. \n\"To me, the vote on Measure S represents a significant break with 50 years of resistance to growth in Los Angeles,\" says author D.J. Waldie. \nEven Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association and a decades-long leader in slow-growth fights, was forced to concede the significance of Measure S' rout. \n\"It surprised me, the large margin of victory,\" Close says. \"I think the takeaway is that the homeowners in Los Angeles no longer have the political clout they once had.\" Related Stories L.A. Voter Guide: Deciphering This Election's Most Contentious Issue, Measure S \nAlong with the results of the November election – when Santa Monica voters rejected the slow growth Measure LV and when L.A. County passed Measure M, which raised taxes to fund light rail construction – the rejection of Measure S is a watershed moment in the history of Los Angeles, a confirmation that the city wants to become more urbanized, more dense, less reliant on the automobile, more inclusive and, perhaps, a more unified city. \nTo be sure, Measure S' defeat has many factors. Unlike a previous slow-growth ballot measure, Proposition U, which was passed by voters in 1986, Measure S had no support from elected officials. Its main backer, AIDS Healthcare Foundation President Michael Weinstein, is a divisive figure to say the least. \n\"He’s not somebody that could get tens of thousands of people to charge after him,\" says Raphael Sonenshein, Executive Director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State University Los Angeles. \nSonenshein also wonders if Donald Trump and the growing resistance to his presidency effectively stole Measure S' limelight. \n\"There appeared to be a brewing revolt against City Hall and against growth,\" Sonenshein says. \"I don’t know if Donald Trump sucked the air out of everything else. It's kind of hard to have a rebellion in those conditions. There’s already a rebellion going on.\" Upcoming Events", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-09T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T21:09:14.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
