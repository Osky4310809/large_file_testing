She was seen at the entrance to the temple near the Park Kret market.\nThis embed is invalid\n‘She does something really bad. Is this really what a mum should do? The only way the lady could help was by taking the video and sharing it.\n‘Listen to the kid, he says “I cannot breathe, I cannot breath”. The woman can help the kid a little by taking picture, but they did not have the chance to get involved.\nDonald Trump should be sent to Guantanamo Bay says former prisoner ‘The police are already trying to find the bad mother. The boy was released after the mum was happy with the punishment. It would have been about two or three minutes.’\nThe boy is understood to have been released a short time later by the mother after she was satisfied with the punishment.\nCorporal Namsang said that the authorities had been alerted to the footage and are likely to to start an investigation to trace the mother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T10:00:47.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
