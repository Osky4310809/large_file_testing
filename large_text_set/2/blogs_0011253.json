The original movie was a surprise hit a couple of years ago, and the new film - titled Pacific Rim: Uprising - has a lot to live up to. With a new director in Steven DeKnight, and new stars in John Boyega and Scott Eastwood, the movie will need to appease fans of the franchise while still finding a voice on its own. \nThere are plenty of changes coming to Uprising , but the creative team has found a way tether the two properties together. Hermann and Newt, the hilarious pair of scientists from the original movie, will appear in the sequel. \nCharlie Day , who plays Newt, revealed that fans should be excited for the changes. A large part of that has to do with the talented cast they've brought in for Uprising . \"I think with Boyega and the rest of the young cast that the studio filled out, It's going to be interesting to follow this new young group of people. And then Burn [Gorman] and I, who are obviously back, sort of tethering things to the world of the first movie. I'm excited. I think it's going to be fun to see monsters and robots fight each other again.\" Day also teased that there's some big changes ahead for his own character. Fans may remember him, but he'll have an all-new style this time around. \"Newt is back and I can tell you he looks good. He's got all new clothes. He looks really good.\" Pacific Rim: Uprising opens Feb. 23, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:51:44.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
