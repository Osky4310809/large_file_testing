Durkin | 6:55 am, February 15th, 2017 \nThe argument that President Donald Trump attempted to make on Twitter yesterday in light of the unexpected resignation of his National Security Advisor was that the “ real story here ” was about leaks from the White House, not General Michael Flynn ‘s impropriety on misleading the administration about his calls to a Russian counterpart. \nIt’s an excuse that was shared by other Republicans as well, and one that Joe Scarborough Wednesday morning was infuriated over. The Morning Joe host went out of his way to chastise his fellow GOP members over it, saying, “That is so separated from the context of what has happened over the past eighteen months.” \nScarborough invoked the name of Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort , the embattled political operative whose ties to pro-Kremlin efforts in the Ukraine essentially ended his role in the Trump orbit in August . Manafort’s name has resurfaced in the past 24 hours in light of Flynn’s connections to Russia as well. \nScarborough continued Wednesday, “We have information and the intel community has had information of connection between the Russians and members of Donald Trump’s campaign at the very same time that the Russians are trying to fix the United States of America’s election for President. Republicans and editorial writers can not be so stupid to think they just picked on poor Michael Flynn out of nowhere.” \n“Republicans, you can just stop that BS,” he added firmly. \n“Note to Republicans,” added cohost Mika Brzezinski . “This only gets worse.” \nWatch above via MSNBC. \nHave a tip we should know?
