Draymond Green had a pretty horrendous first half, adding five turnovers to his three fouls. He also had five points and ended the half with a +/- of -9. Advertisement \nGreen fulfilled his shit talking quota at the very start of the game, yapping at Paul Pierce and appearing to roast him for trying to get drum up a farewell tour. \nTowards the end of the second quarter, Green leapt for a loose ball and somehow that right leg of his came up in what looked a lot like his dick-kicking crimes of the recent past . Thankfully, his foot was unable to zero in on anyone’s dick and balls. \nThe Clippers haven’t beaten Golden State since Christmas 2014, but yeah, this sure feels like a rivalry.
