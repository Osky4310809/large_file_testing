It is the one position where we are overbooked really,\" United boss Mourinho told Fox Sports . \n\"We have [Jesse] Lingard, [Henrikh] Mkhitaryan, [Juan] Mata, [Marcus] Rashford, sometimes [Wayne] Rooney, Memphis. We have a lot of players there. So it is not easy for anyone of them to play. \n\"I was informed by the club that there is a chance Memphis could leave. From a human point of view, I cannot stop him from leaving when he is not playing under me. \n\"If he is staying, I would be more than happy because he is a fantastic guy and a very good player. I feel so sorry that I am not giving him opportunities to play. A player of his age needs to be playing matches. \nRUMOURS: Memphis deal deadlocked \n\"If he stays with me, for sure, he will play some games because we have so many matches. \n\"If he leaves, we wish him all the best for the future because he is a fantastic kid.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-08T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T02:03:28.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
