(Photo: Vera Anderson/WireImage) More Emma Watson has been extremely candid during her Beauty and the Beast press tour (and we appreciate it). After being labelled antifeminist for appearing semitopless in a Vanity Fair shoot, the actress strongly remarked: “I don’t know what my tits have to do with it.” And now for some reason, she’s let the world in on her intimate grooming habits. Speaking to Into the Gloss , Emma revealed that she has actually taken advice from Gwyneth Paltrow and started using Fur Oil . “I’ll use that anywhere from the ends of my hair to my eyebrows to my pubic hair. It’s an amazing all-purpose product,” she commented. The product softens hair and clears pores to prevent in-growns (a problem for us all). In the in-depth interview, the 26-year-old discussed her journey to a truly sustainable life, saying: “You can’t talk the talk if you don’t walk the walk.” She also speaks about embracing her freckles as she’s gotten older, preferring a much more natural look when it comes to makeup: “When we were filming Beauty and the Beast , I insisted on keeping my freckles as a part of the movie. There are so many young girls who are going through puberty who really hate having them, so I felt the need to say that I have them and that I think the look of natural skin is beautiful.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:51:51.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
