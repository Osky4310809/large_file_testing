Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images Paul MacInnes at Cherry Red Records Stadium   22.01   22.20   \nNon-league Sutton United pulled off a crazy late Cup upset against AFC Wimbledon , winning away at the last against a team 50 places above them in the football pyramid. \nThe substitute Dan Fitchett assisted and scored in the final knockings of the match to overturn a result that had looked well within the home side’s grasp for much of its running. One-nil up after 10 minutes, the Dons were soon reduced to 10 men but looked very much in control until Roarie Deacon’s equaliser with 15 minutes remaining. The final whistle brought ecstatic scenes on a freezing night in south London.   Read more \nA womble greeted the teams on the pitch, banging the lid of a blue wheelie bin as accompaniment. The theme tune to “The Big Match” played out over the PA system and as the teams flashed up on a dot matrix scoreboard you could be forgiven for feeling you had been transported back in time. This felt like a throwback to what the FA Cup has always been about, with two teams throwing league positions and form out of the window and going toe to toe on the pitch. \nFrom the off, the action was full-blooded. Wimbledon had the technique, but Sutton were not short on either athleticism or guile. The first chance of the match indeed fell to the visitors from the National League, when the former Arsenal youngster Craig Eastmond was played into the box in the fourth minute. With only the keeper to beat his shot was charged down by James Shea and Deacon was unable to turn in the follow-up. \nSix minutes later the Dons were in front. A free-kick, halfway inside the Sutton half and wide on the left, was lofted deep by Dean Parrett. It seemed difficult to miss the home side’s dominant No9 Tom Elliott lingering on the penalty spot, but somehow Sutton did, and Elliott duly took advantage of the space to head the ball past Ross Worner at the near post for his 12th goal of the season. \nAnother five minutes later, however, there was another twist. The Kingsmeadow pitch’s divots were causing a problem for both teams. Sadly for the Dons centre-half Paul Robinson he misjudged the bounce of a ball when in position as the last defender. \nRobinson swiped and missed, Matt Tubbs nicked it off him and did not need much by way of subsequent contact from his opponent to go sprawling onto the ground. The referee, Chris Sarginson, did not hesitate in dismissing Robinson. \nThe Dons manager, Neil Ardley, didn’t hang around either, immediately bringing off Elliott’s strike partner Dom Poleon for the defender Chris Robertson. The new arrival was soon called into action to block Maxime Biamou’s shot after Shea had spilled a looping cross. Six minutes before half-time however the home side nearly doubled their lead when their captain, Barry Fuller, broke down the right but his shot was saved by the feet of a sprawling Worner. Christian Benteke double inspires Crystal Palace win against Bolton Read more \nThe retractable tunnel had barely been put away at the start of the second half before Sutton had a great chance to equalise, Deacon placing the ball wide from six yards out, though he was later judged offside. It looked like a harbinger of things to come, but Wimbledon dominated possession for the first 25 minutes of the half. \nSutton’s response was in turn to up the physical contact with hefty challenges on Parrett and Taylor poleaxing both players but somehow leaving referee Sarginson unmoved. Perhaps he was experiencing a bout of nostalgia too. The Sutton manager, Paul Doswell, then made a double change in the hope of putting the hosts under some late pressure. \nThe pressure told with 15 minutes remaining. Sutton had been on top and a free-kick was taken quickly, too quickly for the Dons defence. The ball came to Sutton’s striker Deacon on the edge of the box. Just like Elliott in the first half he had time and space, and picked a shot that flew past Shea. \nAs the atmosphere continued to heat up around the freezing Kingsmeadow stadium, Sutton desperately sought a winner. Biamou saw his long-range shot blocked manfully by Robertson. Wimbledon looked shot of confidence all of a sudden. Then, as the clock turned to 90 minutes Biamou connected at the far post with substitute Dan Fitchett’s cross. For a moment there was a stunned silence, then a riot of noise as the Sutton bench, players and fans all went wild together. Fitchett struck again with seconds remaining, his header looping into an empty net as Wimbledon desperately pushed forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T00:32:36.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
