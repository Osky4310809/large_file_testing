Well I've been to quite a few UKIP conferences but even by their standards this fringe leaflet is completely batshit. pic.twitter.com/P0R2piPMnI — Jim Waterson (@jimwaterson) February 17, 2017 \nA spokeswoman for the Christian Soldiers told The Independent : “Nigel Farage gave us 100 per cent support and we are part of Ukip .\" \nShe added: “It’s a little fellowship for the Christian members of Ukip and there are a lot of Christians in Ukip . It is for those who believed in the holy Bible and take it literally. It doesn’t do any harm and follows the teaching of Jesus to love one another but most of all to love God.” \nHowever, two years ago, Ukip said it was distancing itself from the group after it distributed a homophobic newsletter which suggested that gay people could be converted from a state of vice. At the time, a Ukip spokesman said the group was “authorised but not official” and that he newsletter was “not of an acceptable standard to be associated with the Ukip brand”. \nBut the Christian Soldier's spokeswoman told The Independent that at an annual general meeting of the party, \"the question was asked whether to cut ties with Christian Soldiers, the confident support of members towards Christian Soldiers was very clear.\" UK news in pictures \nThe sun rises behind Tower Bridge in London PA wire \nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge visit to RAF base, Cambridgeshire, UK Rex \nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge visit to RAF base, Cambridgeshire, UK Rex 4/16 14 February 2017 \nThe Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Royal Voluntary Service, is given roses by RVS volunteer Dave Hancock at a tea party and swing dance at The Trinity Centre in Bristol PA wire 5/16 14 February 2017 \nThe Duchess of Cornwall, President of the Royal Voluntary Service, dances with Graeme Puckett of Hoppin' Mad at a tea party and swing dance at The Trinity Centre in Bristol PA wire 6/16 14 February 2017 \nThe scene outside Topshop in the Oracle shopping centre in Reading, Berkshire, where according to reports a 10-year-old boy died from severe head injuries following an incident involving shop furniture PA wire 7/16 14 February 2017 \nCreator Nick Ryan examines Machine 9, an electromechanical sound instrument that transforms the movement of 27,000 pieces of space junk into sound in real time, is put on display at the Science Museum in London PA wire 8/16 14 February 2017 \nCreator Nick Ryan examines Machine 9, an electromechanical sound instrument that transforms the movement of 27,000 pieces of space junk into sound in real time, is put on display at the Science Museum in London PA wire 9/16 14 February 2017 \nMayor of London Sadiq Khan poses for a photograph with Tinie Tempah and MTV presenter Laura Whitmore at the offices of Viacom in London where he announced that the MTV European Music Awards will be held in the city PA wire 10/16 14 February 2017 \nThe Tornado locomotive at Appleby station before it pulls the first timetabled main line steam-hauled service for half a century across the Ribblehead viaduct in North Yorkshire PA wire \nBritain's Queen Elizabeth arrives to officially open the National Cyber Security Centre in London, Britain, Reuters 12/16 14 February 2017 \nThe new National Cyber Crime Security centre in Victoria, central London.
