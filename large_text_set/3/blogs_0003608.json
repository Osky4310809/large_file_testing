Justice Sylvanus Nsofor, who was asked a couple of questions among which was to recite the National Anthem by a member of the committee, ‎Senator Gbenga Ashafa (APC Lagos East), staunchly argued with the lawmakers and refused to recite the anthem as requested. \nThe lawmakers who exhausted by the back and forth argument, and left in complete surprise at his refusal, were left with no option, but to ask him to take a bow and leave. \nHon. Justice Sylvanus. A Nsofor, who is a nominee from Imo State, was born on March 17, 1935‎ in Oguta, Imo State. \nHe was one-time Judge of the High Court of Nigeria, Justice of the Court of Appeal, and Lecturer in Law, Holborn College of Law,n London‎. \nThe second nominee, Mr. Adeyinka Olatokunbo Asekun, unlike the first however responded to questions brilliantly to the amazement of lawmakers. \nMr. Asekun, who had a long stint as a retail banker in the banking sector, was educated at the Wisconsin University and California State University, both in the United States of America. \nThe nominee’s name was forwarded to the National Assembly by the Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo. \nResponding to how Nigeria could strengthen the Naira through‎ its foreign exchange policy, Mr. Asekun advised the federal government to embark on rebuilding the country’s export structure in the various countries. \nMembers of the committee who were impressed and satisfied with the responses of the nominee‎, asked him to take a bow and leave. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:46:23.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
