Brittanee Drexel: 5 Fast Facts You Need to know Published Updated 4:07 pm EDT, October 7, 2016 42 Comments By Jessica McBride 8.4k Share Tweet Follow Brittanee Drexel. (Facebook) \nA 17-year-old missing New York girl was gang raped, shot and thrown into an alligator pit after disappearing during spring break, an FBI agent says in court documents. \nBrittanee Drexel was last seen in 2009 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where she had gone on spring break without her parents’ knowledge. \nFBI agent Gerrick Munoz provided the new account in court, the Charleston Post and Courier reports. It stems from an inmate’s story to police about what he says happened to Drexel. \nFor years, family and friends have maintained hope that they would learn what happened to the teenager. Drexel’s parents, Dawn and Chad Drexel, went on Dr. Phil’s program on October 7, and discussed those allegations. Her mother said, “My heart just broke because Brittanee didn’t deserve this,” according to UK Daily Mail. \nHere’s what you need to know: 1. Videos Captured the Last Moments of Brittanee Drexel Before She Disappeared \nBrittanee’s last days were captured on video, including one taken the day before she disappeared in Myrtle Beach (see above). \nThis compilation video below shows surveillance video that captured the teenager walking out of the Bluewater Hotel where she was staying on April 25, 2009. She was leaving the hotel to go back to another hotel where she was staying. \nPolice had said previously that Brittanee went to the Bluewater hotel to see a friend from Rochester, Peter Brozowitz, who was staying there with friends, according to WCSC. She stayed 10 minutes. Police said Brozowitz and his friends were not suspects. \nDrexel was never seen alive again. \nAfter she vanished, Drexel’s cellphone pinged the next day “near the South Santee River, between McClellanville and Georgetown.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T04:51:05.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
