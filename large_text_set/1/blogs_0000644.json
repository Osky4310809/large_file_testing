(AP Photo/Reinhold Matay) Obama, born to run, not to govern   1/2/17   \nIn an in-depth interview after the election, President Obama 's most memorable line was his confident proclamation that he would have beaten President-elect Trump if he had run in 2016. \nThis highlighted a similarity between Obama and Trump. Both men, when challenged, quickly point to polls or election results, like an athlete trying to end a schoolyard debate by pointing to the scoreboard. \nIt's fitting that Obama should leave office this way, the way he's answered many challenges throughout the past eight years, by trumpeting his skill at winning elections. Because winning elections, it turns out, was nearly the sum total of the president's political virtues. \nObama's most admired traits, his oratory, intelligence, quick wit and unique background, were all attributes for running and winning elections, and getting donors to part with their money. What he never showed were skills for coalition-building, legislating, persuading rivals and deal-making â€” that is, for governing. \n\"I serve as a blank screen,\" Obama explained in one of his pre-presidency memoirs, \"on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.\" He was correct, and the 2016 results confirm it. Millions of his voters from 2008 and 2012 became Trump voters in 2016, enough to swing the election, and it was Obama's eloquent vagueness that made this possible. \nBeing a blank screen is good for a candidate but is a bad trait in a leader. A leader lays out a direction and convinces people to follow him to a shared goal. If you never identify what you are fighting, never declare which way you're going and always let everyone think you're facing whichever way they are, any forward marching you inspire will tear the country asunder rather than move it forward together. \nObama's other character traits, unmistakable after the past eight years, also lend themselves wonderfully to campaigning and horribly to governing. \nThe president's impermeable self-regard was surely an asset on the campaign trail. A man who could pen two memoirs before age 45 has the requisite self-confidence to convince voters and donors that he can be president after less than one term in the U.S. Senate. Obama's self-confidence was incandescent, and it caused literal swooning at his campaign rallies and figurative swooning from the press. \nYet Obama's self-confidence shaded into overweening vanity and arrogance after he seated himself in the Oval Office, and it prevented him from learning from his mistakes or seeing his own flaws, however clearly they were shoved in his face. Two years into his first term, Obama's party took a historic drubbing. Democrats lost more than 60 House seats and six Senate seats. Republicans also gained a handful of governors' mansions and took nearly 700 state legislative seats away from Democrats. Obama replied to this clear and thorough rejection by saying he had merely failed to communicate clearly how much good he was doing.
