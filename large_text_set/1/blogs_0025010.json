Reed, meanwhile, had to go to the Semis to make his way into the Main, following Yamaha teammate Cooper Webb over the line in the first of the 5-lap sprints. \nTomac took the Main Event holeshot and immediately pulled out a huge gap, boasting a 13-second lead after just seven minutes of racing. Justin Brayton, Cole Seely, Dungey and Millsaps rounded out the top five in the early stages. Reed had jumped to eighth on the opening lap, running a tight line through the first corner. \nIn just his second 450SX race, Malcolm Stewart attempted a pass on Millsaps for fifth, but the two made contact and ‘Mookie’ went down. \nMillsaps soon lost fifth to Reed, who began to carve his way through the top five along with Dungey. \nAt the halfway point, Dungey started to challenge Seely for second. However, as the two fought each other, Reed blew by them both, eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd. A battle we won't soon forget. pic.twitter.com/Ukxkm6ZZeO — Supercross LIVE! (@SupercrossLIVE) January 29, 2017 \nBut by that point Tomac was long gone. \nThe Kawasaki rider’s lead expanded out to over 16 seconds, Reed able to pick back four of them by the time the chequered flag waved. \nThe second placing is easily Reed’s best of the season, following a pair of sevenths and a mechanical retirement from the first round. \nIf anything, Saturday night’s race proves that the championship is not just Dungey’s yet, despite Roczen’s vicious crash last week in Anaheim. \nIt wasn’t just the 450SX class where Kawasaki came out on top, however. 450SX Glenfield highlights \nIn the 250SX West class, Justin Hill picked up his second consecutive win after a late-race battle with Shane McElrath. \nMcElrath had gone down in his heat race and had to go to the LCQ, but he was still able to get a good start in the Main due to the fact that a long run into Turn 1 meant the gate pick didn’t make a huge difference. \nRookie Austin Forkner took the holeshot while McElrath and Hill were left battling for second place in the early stages. \nEventually, however, McElrath broke away and disposed of Forkner for the lead. As the race entered its closing stages, however, Hill made a late charge and made a pass on McElrath — who had been held up by lapped traffic — with three laps to go. \nMcElrath got the lead back, but then lost it again for good with two laps to go. Australian Dan Reardon landed his best result of the year in sixth place. \nMonster Energy Supercross now heads to Oakland for the fifth round of the season. 250SX West Glenfield highlights", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-30T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-30T02:10:15.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
