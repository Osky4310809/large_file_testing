Elor Azaria insisted his life was in danger. \nA combat medic in the Israel Defense Forces, Azaria was stationed in Hebron last March when a terrorist carried out a knife attack against fellow soldiers, World Israel News reported . \nThe terrorist lay wounded on the ground — “neutralized,” the outlet said — and then Azaria fatally shot him in the head, World Israel News added. \nAzaria noted he feared for his life and thought the terrorist could have had a bomb on his body, the outlet reported, but the prosecution called what Azaria did an unlawful act of vengeance. \nSo an Israeli military court in Tel Aviv sentenced Azaria on Tuesday to 18 months in prison after finding him guilty of manslaughter in January, World Israel News said, adding that he also was demoted to private and got an additional 12-month suspended sentence.

The outlet said the prosecution wanted three to five years in prison. \nSome Israeli officials have called for Azaria’s pardon, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n“This is a difficult and painful day for us all,” Netanyahu said in a January Facebook post supporting a pardon, the Times said, adding that Israel’s president or Army officials can issue a pardon. \nWorld Israel News said a poll following Azaria’s conviction indicates 70 percent of the Israeli public favors his pardon. \nAfter his sentencing, Azaria’s family sang Israel’s national anthem in the courtroom.
