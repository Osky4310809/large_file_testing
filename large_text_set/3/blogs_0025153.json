Eric Dier \nDier’s Spurs team-mate Harry Kane is among the leading contenders to take on the role, Jordan Henderson and Joe Hart among the other possible contenders. \nHowever with Dier established as a regular starter for England as a midfield anchorman the 23-year-old could be an outsider contender for the armband. It is not an opportunity he would shy away from. \n“It’s an ambition of mine. I’d love to one day be able to do that,” Dier said. \n“That’s something the manager decides and I’m sure he’ll pick who he thinks is best. \n“I think I’ve always had qualities that a captain may have and I think I can do that job.” Okogba", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-25T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-25T00:47:01.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
