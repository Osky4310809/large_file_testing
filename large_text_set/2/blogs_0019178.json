Another tech juggernaut appears to be cribbing from the ephemeral messaging app, as well. On Monday, Apple was granted a patent for an \"avatar editing environment\" that looks a lot like Bitmoji , the popular app from Snapchat-owned Bitstrips .\nSEE ALSO: How Facebook is trying to dominate mobile without owning your smartphone\nThe patent document , which was first picked up by Mic , says this theoretical product would allow users to create custom avatars for \"online games and other applications.\" Starting with a blank face, users can add, rescale and resize features like eyes, a nose and a mouth. They can also modify face shapes and skin color and will be able to choose whether to create the avatar automatically or manually.\nYou can see from the screenshots below how alike the patent is to Bitmoji:\nApple's patent\nImage: united states patent and trademark office\nBitmoji\nImage: bitstrips inc./screenshot\nAs you can see, the resemblance is pretty real. And if you're thinking what we're thinking, yes, it is a little ridiculous that in this emoji-ridden day and age, avatar editing environments can still be patented. Bitmoji, after all, isn't an entirely new concept. Avatar creations have been around for ages. Remember Yahoo Avatar?\nTo be fair, Apple filed this patent in 2011, long before Snapchat acquired Bitstrips. But it's hard not to scream copycat when much of the functionality seems so similar to Bitmoji.\nApple patents don't always come to fruition though, so this could very well be another patent stashed away at the bottom of some storage space at Apple HQ.\nAnd if it does? We can probably count on Miranda Kerr to say something about it .\nBONUS: Signs you're reading too much into instant messages with emoji", "external_links": ["http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ugyO1ncjR1eoJUdvVgbpKUog-nk=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390312%2F5f1c3b3b-5af7-4c06-bb9b-cc3e99782020.PNG", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/4YStEx7w.m3u8", "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9,576,400.PN.&OS=PN/9,576,400&RS=PN/9,576,400", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wERmp9Dtf1PKvr0txPz5tKCMnAU=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390279%2F48961d7b-f87f-4236-917e-a6fe291faf7e.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/16lfeiDz9UeX-nUVR1tJL2pmV-I=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390279%2F48961d7b-f87f-4236-917e-a6fe291faf7e.png", "http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iVvkg6TSXXr6WvP80Iw7fKsA5Bo=/fit-in/1200x9600/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390312%2F5f1c3b3b-5af7-4c06-bb9b-cc3e99782020.PNG", "https://mic.com/articles/169119/apple-patent-bitmoji#.GgNlwh925", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/4YStEx7w.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:58:39.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
