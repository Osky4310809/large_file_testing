Ok https://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 27, 2017\nThe crewed version of Dragon hasn't flown people to space. Currently, the uncrewed version transports supplies to the International Space Station. The Falcon Heavy rocket hasn't even performed a test flight, but both of these steps should be completed before the lunar mission.\nFalcon Heavy should fly for the first time before the end of this year, and the crewed Dragon spacecraft will make an uncrewed mission to the International Space Station before the end of the year, with a crewed mission to follow about six months later.\nThe lunar mission is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nNeedless to say, planning a full-on crewed moon circumnavigation on this timetable is ambitious to say the least.\nMusk also made it clear that if NASA wants to send their own astronauts on this type of flight first, then SpaceX will honor that, pushing the private mission in favor of giving the space agency first priority.\nThis also shouldn't be the only moonshot for SpaceX. Musk expects that eventually the company should be able to launch one or two of these kinds of flights per year.\nIf this first lunar flight does fly on time, it will happen 50 years after the Apollo 8 mission that brought NASA astronauts around the moon ahead of the Apollo 11 landing in 1969.\nThe mission will also have another historical tie in that the Falcon Heavy will launch from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A, which was the starting point for many of NASA's Apollo missions to the moon.\nNow, if SpaceX gets its way, the pad will get a new life as the start of many more.\nBONUS: Relive SpaceX's incredible daytime rocket landing with this video", "external_links": ["https://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/ojM8bRlZ.m3u8", "http://www.spacex.com/news/2017/02/27/spacex-send-privately-crewed-dragon-spacecraft-beyond-moon-next-year", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/836328719165763584", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/ojM8bRlZ.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-28T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:21:33.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
