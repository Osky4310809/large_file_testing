I can fly higher than a eagle. You are the wind beneath my wings. \nHeroes come in many shapes and sizes. \nSuperman was an alien, Batman was a weird rich guy with a victim complex outfitted in a fancy cape, and Shane Spencer is a man in a bikini braving a blizzard on a quad . \nLike all good heroes, we didn't know we needed Spencer until he was here. \nAs a blizzard bore down on the Maritimes Monday, Spencer—this is speculation—looked longingly out of his window in Minto, New Brunswick, a single tear rolling down his cheek. No, he whispered, not today. \nSpencer then went to his dresser and pulled out the Crusher, his bikini, and took a moment to prepare himself for what he had to do for his town. He pulled on the Crusher, walked slowly to his garage and loaded up onto his faithful steed—his quad. \nIt was time to start plowing. \nHere is where the video of our good hero picks up. As the snow falls to the ground Spencer pulls into the frame, shoveling the road clear for the citizens of Minto to be free. When he gets close to the camera Spencer stops, turns off the quad and turns to address the viewers directly—to let them know they'll be OK. \n\"As you can see ladies and gentleman the government isn't doing their job,\" says an unmistakable eastern drawl. \n\"Your local weatherman [his superhero name] Shane Spencer is live on location here, coming to you here from the post road. Doesn't matter the road conditions or weather conditions, I'm here doing a great job.\" \nYou sure are Shane. The hero at work. Photo via screenshot \nThe video of the New Brunswicker's heroics has been seen by almost 250,000 people within 24 hours. Spencer told Global News that he made the video to clear the side streets and make a few people smile. \n\"The person will go watch me and get a good chuckle, see a chubby guy in a Speedo, why can't you laugh when you see that?\" he said. \"It's something like a car wreck, you can't look away.\" \nYou're right Mr. Spencer, we can't look away because you're a goddamn hero. \nFollow Mack Lamoureux on Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:30:47.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
