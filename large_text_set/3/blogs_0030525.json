Pictures debuted the new Justice League trailer ( watch it here! ) and we’ve gone through and pulled out nearly 100 screenshots that you can view in the gallery below! The Justice League trailer screenshots give you a good look at characters such as Amy Adams’ Lois Lane, Amber Heard’s Mera, J.K. Simmons’ Commissioner Gordon and Billy Crudup’s Henry Allen. \nDirector Zack Snyder also talked to USA Today about the characters in the team-up film. About Batman, he said: \n“He’s been a loner for certainly his crime-fighting career, maybe with the exception of Robin. When we meet him in BvS, he’s definitely at this low point of isolation. That was always our intention, that Justice League would be this continuation for Batman to evolve into a more complete hero.” \nWonder Woman has her own movie coming out on June 2 which will “flesh out and realize (her island home) Themyscira and embrace canon with her and get all the elements to mash up that I love from the original stories,” says Snyder. “But also we’ll see that dovetail into not only the why of BvS, but even now the why of Justice League and who she is finally realized. We know now where she comes from.” \nSnyder talked about Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg as well: “They’re each such awesome personalities in the movie. You have Jason stomping around as this inked hairy man, just this mythic figure. And you’ve got Ezra, who’s full of life and hilarious and all over the place and amazing — a really fun and also poignant Flash. And Ray’s story is in a lot of the ways the heart of the movie.” \nAnd what about Superman? “It’s hard to have a Justice League without Superman. That’s how I feel about it,” Snyder said with a laugh. “It was always a super-intriguing concept to me to have this opportunity to have him make that sacrifice but also have him be this, in a weird sort of way, the why of Justice League: What do you do now with him? What does the team think? What does the world need? All that comes into play. It’s fun for us but it’ll be interesting for audiences what we do with him.” \nJustice League stars Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Ezra Miller as The Flash, Ray Fisher as Cyborg, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, with J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon, and Amy Adams as Lois Lane. \nFueled by the hero’s restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Justice League sees Bruce Wayne enlist the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. \nDirected by Zack Snyder ( Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , Man of Steel ), the screenplay is by Chris Terrio from a story by Snyder and Terrio. The producers are Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, Jon Berg and Geoff Johns. The executive producers are Jim Rowe, Wesley Coller, Curt Kanemoto, Chris Terrio and Ben Affleck. \nJustice League will open in theaters on November 10, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-26T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-26T01:33:28.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
