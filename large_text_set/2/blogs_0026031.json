The Panthers announced they re-signed Addison to a three-year deal. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported the contract is worth $22.5 million. \" Mario has shown he is one of the best emerging pass-rushers in the league and he deserves this contract,\" general manager Dave Gettleman said in a statement, per Bryan Strickland of the team's official website. \" He consistently affects the quarterback, and we envision an increased role for him in our defense. He's a pro in the way he approaches the game and brings an upbeat attitude to our locker room. We're thrilled he will continue his career with the Panthers.\" The 29-year-old defensive lineman started only one game in 2016, but he appeared in 14 and led the Panthers in sacks with 9.5, along with 27 tackles. After bouncing around between the Chicago Bears , Indianapolis Colts , Washington Redskins and Panthers over the first few seasons of his career as an undrafted player out of Troy, Addison finally settled in as an important part of Carolina's rotation in 2014. He has registered a combined 22 sacks over the past three seasons and hit the free-agent market at an ideal time, with pass-rushers being at a premium. Despite having his pick of the litter in free agency, Addison made it clear at the conclusion of the 2016 season that he hoped to return to Carolina in 2017 and beyond, according to Strickland : \"I like this organization. They are players' coaches. They look out for you. ... It's a business. I just hope everything works out for the best.\" Addison was a huge bargain for the Panthers last season, as he had a cap hit of just $1.62 million, per Spotrac.com . While Addison had a desire to remain with the Panthers, he also expressed the importance of landing a significant contract, according to Scott Fowler of the Charlotte Observer : \"It's very important. ... I want to get a real good contract. I want a contract where I can take care of my family and can say that I put in the work and it really paid off.\" Addison put himself in position to do precisely that by nearly hitting double digits in sacks last season, which is the type of production teams across the league are willing to pay handsomely for. Although Addison wasn't going to come cheaply, he was viewed as something of a bargain in comparison to other options at the position, such as Jason Pierre-Paul. The Panthers have seen firsthand what he is capable of, and since losing his presence would have been potentially devastating to their defense, they decided to give him the raise he earned through great play in 2016. Carolina needs its defense to return to an elite level in order to get back in contention in the NFC next season, and retaining Addison is a move that should increase the likelihood of that happening.
