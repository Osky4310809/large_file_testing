If you understand trolling and how to use it as a tactic, you understand that this is what he was doing in his press conference the other day . Everything he said was designed to derail the conversation from his horrible week and Michael Flynn’s resignation . He threw out a couple lies for the media to write about, he made an outrageous statement comparing his administration to a finely tuned machine, he blamed the media, and he asked a black reporter if she was friends with the National Black Caucus (you know … because she’s black). All of this was chum thrown to the media to give them 20 other things to write about to disrupt the more threatening questions about Russia (What did Trump know and when did he know it?). In other words, our President is a well-versed troll. \nI’ve even known conservatives who go so far as to deliberately spell things wrong so that some “liberal” would correct them and they could look like a a victim of mean academic liberals. And sadly, this tactic works more often than I’d like to admit. It seems to be easier for us to see the base as “stupid,” rather than as using a tactic designed to make us look immoral and elitist in that academic sense. \nAnother good source is to read some conservative literature, listen to some conservative pundits, or find yourself a good person online to practice having discussions with. \nNOTE: Just don’t pay for any of this material. I’ve checked out Glenn Beck, Ann Coulter, and Rush Limbaugh all from the local library. You only have to suffer one or two disapproving looks from the librarian. \n4. Hold your ground and know your beliefs \nOkay, we’ve set the stage. Now here is one of the strongest strategies to use. \nIt’s simple in theory, but hard to do in practice. \nAlmost all conservative tactics have to do with changing the argument. \nStraw men, changing the subject, accusation, name calling, moving the goalposts: all of these are designed to change the argument to something else and knock you off your game. \nWhy, you ask? \nBecause they want you to either A) take the bait and start arguing on their terms, or B) as Ann wrote, become speechless with sputtering, impotent rage. \nAre you starting to understand the game? \nYou’re trying to have a rational conversation with someone while they are trying to bait you and make you angry. \nThese tactics likely sound familiar. \nWhat you have to do is know your beliefs, hold your ground, and don’t take the bait. \nKeep coming back to what you believe. \n5. Let them look bad \nIf someone wants to look like an asshole, let them. This is more powerful than calling them a name. \nThe other day I was posting about how the economy works and demonstrating how demand creates jobs (not tax cuts). I was having a good, honest discussion with someone who I feel is a fairly moderate conservative. \nThen, my favorite troll hopped on: A troll trying to troll me. \nI couldn’t believe my luck. A screaming raging whack job appeared. \nSo what did I do? \nAbsolutely nothing. I let him look like a screaming raging whack job. \nAfter a bit, my conservative friend hopped on and agreed with one of my points. Another less troll-y conservative who didn’t want to be associated with the troll. \nI liked his comment and moved on. Celebrating a victory only makes you look bad. \nOur problem is that all too often we don’t know when we’ve won. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen someone almost win only to, at the last moment, blow it by saying some version of, “I’m glad you agree with me.” \nRemember, the goal is not to win an argument but to win a person. And you don’t win people by telling them you’re right. You win people by being someone they want to follow. \nIf a troll looks like an asshole, no one wants to follow him. The trick is you have to let him look like an asshole without being one yourself. This latter step is not always easy. \n6. How to tell when you’ve won \nIf your relative is a “no win” conservative, you will never win. \nSo how do you know when to quit? \nI work to win the independents. One way to do this is to state what you believe and quit when it’s obvious that the person I’m talking to has said something outside recognized norms. \nWhat does this mean? \nBasically, it means he’s (and mostly it’s a “he”) said something that makes him look foolish. \nWhy? \nBecause at that point, I’ve won over the independents. I’ve won over anyone listening who can be won over. Like Joey Naylor, I’m not playing for him. I’m playing for the audience. \nAt this point, you should let the religious look religious and step away from the argument. The trick is that you need to do this without calling names or calling anyone stupid. \nSometimes you can do this by not saying anything as in my example above. Another good way to do this would have be to say something like, “At this point, we’re just going to have to disagree” and then to restate what you believe. \n7. Why trolling doesn’t work for us \nConservatives are a top-down coordinated campaign backed with money from corporate special interest groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \nTheir strategy is divide and conquer. When people are arguing with each other and dividing, they win. This is what happened in the 2016 election. \nIf you want more division, troll. If you want people to fight with you, you want strategies that bring people together. \nYou want to talk about your values and what you believe. You want to focus on areas where you can begin to fight together so you can learn how to fight together so you can start expanding your fight. \nUnless you’re getting the opposition to pick fights with each other, focus on strategies that bring people together rather than trying to mimic some tactic of the opposition without understanding why the opposition used it. \nCoda \nI hope this helps. Last week, I wrote about a simple process for overcoming objections . \nI’ve been doing this because I find it easier to focus on talking about our beliefs than in trying to keep up with landslide that is the daily news cycle under the current administration. While it’s important to keep up with current events, it’s much more important to contextualize these in terms of what we believe—for example, talking about the importance of checks and balances and democracy. \nWhat’s funny is that people often ask me my opinion on current events because they see me having really interesting conversations. The trick is to know what you believe, and how to talk about it. \nAnd, if you encounter a troll, to keep talking about what you believe and use the trolling to your advantage—or simply don’t engage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:46:22.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
