King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 23 hours ago \nAnthony Kiedis recently admitted that success makes it significantly more difficult to write amazing music. \nRHCP singer told journalist Steve Black : \"It's always hard to write good songs...\"The amount of songs that you've previously written doesn't stop you from writing another good song, but changes in your life from becoming successful will definitely get in your way and hinder your progress of making good songs. \n\"That's my experience; I feel like the further away from streets and struggle and your beginnings you get, the harder it is to make music because life just becomes too easy and soft... Once the struggle's gone, good luck writing good songs. \n\"I can give you a hundred examples of some of the most beautiful songwriters ever - they get rich and comfortable and successful and let this sort of disappear. Gone are those days when you had to fight for something.\" \nKiedis added: \"There's the way people treat you, but there's also being out and about, being in it in the mix, in the dirt and the grit of life. I guess that's a big part of why people want to succeed - to put distance between themselves and suffering and struggling and having a hard time paying the rent and all of that, but it really gets in the way of the art in the long run. \n\"There are people that have managed to avoid that, but they're few and far between, so thank goodness for things like heartbreak and other losses to at least start the fire.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:26:01.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
