Prior to its global release, the sneaker will launch exclusively at Foot Locker.\nLiving up to its name, the GEL-Quantum 360 Knit is constructed with 360 degrees of GEL Cushioning Technology for a remarkably soft landing whatever the surface. The shoe aims to maximize comfort and optimize performance by encouraging natural movement throughout the gait cycle and supporting the entire foot. Two colorways include all-white and all-black that should appeal to the fashion crowd.\nFootwear innovation specialist ASICS has typically balanced function and form when designing the new sneaker; however, this is without a doubt one of its most technologically advanced sneakers to date. On top of the 360-degree GEL Cushioning Technology, the TRUSSTIC System reduces the sole’s weight while maintaining its structural integrity.\nThe Solyte midsole adds to the weightlessness and enhances cushioning and durability, as does ASICS’ High Abrasion Rubber used on the outsole. Finally, the shoe’s upper comes in FluidFit — a multi-directional stretch mesh that adapts to the foot for a sock-like fit.\nASICS GEL-Quantum 360 Knit’s are available exclusively via Foot Locker stores and online from February 16 prior to the global launch on March 1.\nShop Here Check out ASICS’ new Japanese-inspired clothing collection JYUNI White .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:56:50.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
