Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nArsenal's FA Cup campaign gets underway on Saturday with a trip to face Preston North End at Deepdale. \nThe only two English sides to complete a league season without losing a game will go head-to-head in the day's late fixture. \nWhile Simon Grayson looks set to field his strongest side, Arsene Wenger is likely to select some of his fringe players. \nThe FA Cup is the only major competition Arsenal have won in the last decade, and it could prove pivotal in a season in which the club try to convince their star players they are capable of winning trophies. \nMesut Ozil and Alex Sanchez are both negotiating new deals, and both will want assurances over the club's competitiveness as well as pay rises. \nAt this stage in the tournament, though, Arsenal should feel confident of advancing to the next round regardless of the starting XI, and fixtures like this provide brilliant opportunities for squad players to get valuable playing time. \nWith that in mind, MirrorFootball has selected five players Arsene Wenger must start on Saturday.

The Frenchman has been named on the bench in each of Arsenal's last three Premier League games but is yet to make an appearance in the competition. \nWenger is not interested in sending Reine-Adelaide on loan but, at 18, the midfielder is at an important stage of his development and desperately in need of senior experience. \nArsenal paid more than £2million for him 18 months ago and he is arguably their most promising teenager, but he won't realise that potential without first team appearances. \nWhile yet to really impress in any of his five senior games for Arsenal, Reine-Adelaide has not looked out of his depth and is at an age where few good performances could increase his development exponentially.

What followed was a period of stagnation and a lack of game time. It was hoped Chambers would be competing for a starting spot by now, instead he finds himself on loan at Middlesbrough. \nThis time last year, Holding was playing for Bolton against Eastleigh. Now he's at Arsenal and has already made seven appearances this season. But with no chance of him forcing himself into Wenger's first XI and no loan in sight, the FA Cup appears to be his sole platform for appearances. \nHe has experience facing Championship clubs so Deepdale will hold no fear for him and he has already proven his quality this season. He must start. Lucas Perez Lucas Perez scores a stunning goal against Bournemouth (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nLucas is a doubt for the game due to an ankle problem but if he can start, he must. \nThe 28-year-old has six goals in his 12 appearances this season, including a volley Robin van Persie would have been proud of in Arsenal's 3-3 draw with Bournemouth. \nLucas is fresh, hungry and in form. Whether he starts up front or on the wing may depend upon Danny Welbeck's fitness. Either way, he deserves a place in the lineup.

By spring, though, the teenager's attitude had left him on the fringes of the squad and Wenger has opted to keep him in north London for 2016/17. \nHe featured in all three EFL Cup games, as well as the 4-1 win away to Sunderland in the league. Now, though, he finds his prospects limited so will be hoping for a start in the FA Cup. \nWenger's decision to try Maitland-Niles — normally a winger — at full-back this season is an interesting development and his versatility certainly increases the chances of him playing. \nMathieu Debuchy and Carl Jenkinson would both normally be ahead of the 19-year-old in the right-back pecking order, but Wenger admitted this week he was happy for both to leave. If Maitland-Niles has a future at Arsenal and the other two do not, it would seem a wasted opportunity if the teenager did not start against Preston.

At 21, though, that time is running out. Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-06T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-06T13:09:37.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
