In honor of the 600th episode, premiering on Sun., Oct. 16, our resident \"Simpsons\" expert—seriously, she has a tattoo of Homer Simpson on her shoulder and spent 5 hours in makeup once to be \"Simpsonzied\"—picks her 28 favorite episodes. And before you cry: \"No 'Mr. Plow'? No Grimey? Worst episode list … ever!\" bear in mind this is completely unscientific. \nSeason 1, Episode 2 \nThough the Christmas Episode “Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire” is technically the series premiere, this is the episode that truly announced to the world what to expect from America’s favorite family. Bart cheats on an IQ test and is sent to a school for geniuses, only to realize he doesn’t fit in. Even from the start, the relationships were all in place, as evidenced by the end that almost goes sappy when Bart confesses his cheating to Homer but tenderly admits he’s happy they’ve become closer … and Homer erupts in rage. \nSeason 2, Episode 19 \nGuest voice Dustin Hoffman (credited as Sam Etic) is inspiring substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom (you can call him “Mr. Nerdstrom or Mr. Boogerstrom, he doesn’t mind) who also provides the first strong role model in Lisa’s life. There’s plenty of bad parenting from Homer, who encourages Bart to run against Martin for class president in the B storyline, but he comes around in the end and offers solid advice to his kids. And remember: “You are Lisa Simpson.” \nSeason 3, Episode 23 \nA great look at young love (Milhouse falls for new girl Samantha Stanky) and the jealousy it engenders in friends (Bart plots to split them up.) Everything is dead on, from the sex ed video entitled “Fuzzy Bunny’s Guide to You-Know-What” to the “Raiders of the Lost Ark” parody that opens the show. Plus the B storyline, where Homer tries to order a subliminal weight loss tape but is instead sent a vocabulary builder, almost outshines the main plot. \nSeason 4, Episode 5 \nWhile it’s hard to pick a favorite “Treehouse,” it’s also hard to top “Clown Without Pity,” in which an evil Krusty doll fixates on Homer. Luckily, they’re able to find the “Evil/Good” switch and fix it. “Clown” also introduced the word “frogurt” into our lexicon. Also iconic is “King Homer,” which finds Homer typecast as giant ape, and “Dial ‘Z’ For Zombies,” in which Bart and Lisa unleash the undead. \nSeason 4, Episode 11 \nThe episode has absurdly funny moments: Homer has a heart attack, floats above his body, then decides to return when he hears Mr. Burns is sending a ham, only to have the ham canceled upon his revival. But it’s also genuinely heartbreaking as he bids his farewells to his kids in case he doesn’t make it out of surgery. And the expressions on all their faces at the end make it one of the most touching bits in “Simpsons” history. \nSeason 4, Episode 12 \nIt’s hard to pick just a few episodes from Season 4 because this is when “The Simpsons” was really on a roll. But it’s tough to beat the Conan O’Brien-scripted “Monorail” which features the “Music Man”-esque Lyle Lanley (Phil Hartman) selling the town on a needless transportation system. O’Brien performed the “Monorail” song live at the Hollywood Bowl last year and said that no matter his achievements, this episode is the number one thing people ask about. \nSeason 4, Episode 14 \nA personal favorite; with hilarious references to “Barton Fink” and “The Shining” (“Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart!”) just in the first few minutes. Bart lands an awesome brother from the Bigger Brothers program (Phil Hartman again) so Homer gets revenge by finding his own little brother, Pepsi—er, Pepe. The climatic fight at the aquarium, complete with starfishes as ninja stars, is icing on an already full cake. \nSeason 4, Episode 15 \nHow could anyone not choo-choo-choose this episode? Lisa breaks poor Ralph Wiggum’s heart— you can actually pinpoint the moment it rips in two—and then they have to co-star in the school play together. Once again, plenty of hilarity (and the first appearance of Sideshow Raheem, Krusty’s angriest sidekick) and just the right amount of sweetness. \nSeason 4, Episode 17 \nAlso know as the “Dental Plan” (“Lisa Needs Braces!”) episode. Homer convinces the power plant to go on strike so he won’t have to pay for Lisa’s braces, and Mr. Burns mistakes Homer for a genius. Too many great bits to name, but the thousand monkeys on the thousand typewriters (“It was the BLURST of times? You stupid monkey!”) and Homer’s scar from the previous strike (from yelling “Where’s my burrito!” at a food truck) are highlights. \nSeason 5, Episode 2 \nSideshow Bob is the Wile E. Coyote of “The Simpsons,” always failing to kill Bart. This is his greatest outing, complete with the songs of Gilbert and Sullivan, a “Die, Bart, Die!” tattoo he insists reads “The Bart, The!”, and an attempt to enter the Witness Protection Program as The Thompsons. But the highlight has to be Homer terrorizing Bart by trying to show off his new chainsaw and hockey mask. \nSeason 5, Episode 3 \nHomer has to go to college to keep his job at the nuclear power plant (it’s one of the only times Mr. Burns is shown to be a reasonable employer) and expects campus life to be just like in the movies, complete with a crusty old dean. Instead, he befriends some nerds and learns Dungeons and Dragons (until he is slain by an elf) and tries to pull off the ultimate campus prank by kidnapping mascot Sir-Oinks-A-Lot. And he loves to have his tail pulled: “Curly, straight! Curly, straight!” \nSeason 5, Episode 8 \nWho knew Ernest Borgnine would fit so perfectly into the Simpsons world? He’s the celebrity guest dad who goes on a camping trip with the Junior Campers, the same trip in which Homer finds himself stuck on a raft with Flanders. It’s one the best showcases of the Homer/Flanders dynamic, and the rare case where Homer’s stomach saves the day. Plus, an “On the Town” homage, a knife fight between Moe and Hans Moleman, and a “Friday the 13th” capper. \nSeason 6, Episode 4 \nWith the premiere of HBO’s “Westworld” series, many people might be discovering the original film and realizing how much this episode paid tribute to that classic with its theme park overrun with malfunctioning robots. But it also stands on its own as a hilarious, violent, and clever episode with some great lines—and the introduction of the “Bort” license plate. \nSeason 6, Episode 8 \nA wonderful Bart/Lisa episode where the two become rivals in hockey, thanks largely to Homer’s encouragement. Tons of great lines (“Me fail English? That’s unpossible!”) and absurd moments (told not to eat a cake, Homer warns the dessert he’s just gonna walk towards it and chew and if the cake gets in the way, it’s not his fault), it’s also a reminder of the deep love between the siblings. \nSeason 6, Episode 9 \nPossibly the best guest star ever, Dennis Franz plays himself playing Homer Simpson in a Fox TV movie about Homer sexually harassing the babysitter. Of course, it’s all just a misunderstanding—he was merely trying to grab a Gummy Venus De Milo that had stuck itself to her pants. A very cutting and insightful look at tabloid TV news and the dangers of pop rocks mixed with soda. \nSeason 7, Episode 5 \nPigs fly, you don’t make friends with salad, and Paul and Linda McCartney enjoy hanging out in Apu’s garden in the shade. A pro-vegetarian message that manages to be funny and not preachy that also serves as a backdrop for a sweet Lisa-Homer episode. \nSeason 7, Episode 19 \nSelma finally lands the man of his dreams—Troy McClure, who you might remember from such educational films as “Earwigs: Eww!” The faux relationship puts Troy back on the Hollywood map, starting with his appearance in the iconic “Planet of the Apes” musical. \nSeason 7, Episode 23 \nTimelier than ever, this 20-year-old episode shows how a politician uses illegal immigrants as a distraction in his campaign. Apu faces deportation unless he can pass his citizenship test, and his attempts to blend in (he loves the “Nye Mets”) make great fodder. \nSeason 8, Episode 8 \nAfter a hurricane destroys his home and the town rebuilds a worthless replacement, sweet Ned Flanders finally snaps. We then learn his backstory, complete with beatnik parents and a very strange experimentation with the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol, which consisted of months of continuous spanking—stopping only to bat a beach ball. \nSeason 9, Episode 11 \nHomer rents “Paint Your Wagon” and is horrified to learn a movie starring Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin is actually a musical. This leads to a musical episode that once again demonstrates “The Simpsons” skill with music—some of the songs are genuinely Broadway-ready. \nSeason 10, Episode 5 \nOne of the best things to come from the Alec Baldwin-Kim Basinger union (sorry, “Marrying Man”) this episode finds Homer becoming an assistant to the stars. Bonus points to Hollywood Nice Guy Ron Howard for playing himself as a hard-drinking, bathrobe-wearing, baseball-cap-sporting sycophant. \nSeason 13, Episode 16 \nAfter destroying Marge’s scarecrow, Homer becomes king of the crows—something his wife finds creepy. “It’s a murder, Marge. A group of crows is called a murder,” he explains. But the crowd (including Russell Crow and Crow Diddley) turn on him and he turns to medicinal marijuana to ease the pain. Some of the most cleverly dumb stoner humor, including a sequence seen from Homer’s hazy POV in which liquid is rainbows, including the blood pouring from his face after a shave. \nSeason 17, Episode 13 \nLisa tells Homer stories to pass the time after he’s trapped in Carl’s Dad Caverns, and the tales all relate to a treasure in the cave. An innovative, cleverly tied together episode that won the Emmy Award in 2006 for Outstanding Animated Program. \nSeason 19, Episode 7 \nComic Book Guy is a character we love to hate, and possibly relate to a little too much. When a hipster opens a comic book store across the street, we feel his pain. Jack Black is great as the competition but guests Art Spiegelman, Daniel Clowes and Alan Moore steal the show, particularly when Moore discovers there’s a “Watchmen Babies” spin-off. \nSeason 20, Episode 13 \nLisa goes undercover as a nun. Marge goes temporarily blind. It’s an homage to both “The DaVinci Code” and “National Treasure” except intentionally funny. \nSeason 23, Episode 19 \nBart enjoys a family cruise so much he decides to extend it—by convincing everyone on board there’s a pandemic back on land. Bonus points for eerily predicting the Carnival Cruise stuck at sea two years later. \nSeason 26, Episode 1 \nJackie Mason was one of the first big guest names, playing Krusty’s father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, and the show pays tribute to his passing in real-life. It also sets the stage for a plotline where Lisa worries about her own father’s passing. \nSeason 27, Episode 7 \nBroadway legend Laney Fontaine returns and takes Lisa on tour with her. A love letter to the theater, complete with marquees for new hits “Hedwig and the Angry Foot” and “Hamilton” spin-off “Lafayette!” Image: Courtesy of Fox", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T02:34:50.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
