On a batting-friendly wicket in Cuttack, the runs are bound to come for the visitors, but how they put a lid on India's scoring will hold the key for them. He also anticipates dew to play a bigger role in Cuttack than it did in Pune. So the toss will naturally assume great significance once again. Read more, here . \nWhat about India though. Shikhar Dhawan seemed rusty, Yuvraj Singh was fluent but couldn't last the distance and Dhoni too succumbed to the growing pressure of the chase. So there are obvious areas of improvement at the top of the order . \nWhat about the pitch? It's an older brother of the wicket at Pune , exclaims Gavaskar. So brace yourselves for more runs! 2nd ODI - Build Up: England seek balance, India eye series win \nIndia are 1-0 up in the series but the first ODI in Pune didn't teach them many things they didn't already know. Virat Kohli is a master at chases and he appears to carry this Indian limited-overs sides when all others fail. The top and middle orders are still work in progress save for a certain No. 6 position, that appears firmly in little Kedar Jadhav's palms. In front of a packed home crowd and nervous parents, the 31-year-old rose to the occasion and played an innings that'll be remembered ... well atleast until another 350+ total is chased in these days of bat-ball imbalance. \nWhat about England though? They scored 350, had India at 63 for 4 and still lost. The pitfalls of a three-match series is that you don't have a lot of time for momentum-building acts. Immediately they are up in a do-or-die battle. Will they rise to the challenge? Or fold and concede the series. \nWelcome to Cuttack, for the second ODI. This is Kaushik Rangarajan . This should be another cracker. © Cricbuzz TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T09:38:59.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
