It was started and running way before this.... Also, how about the hundreds of employees this is going to affect? Hundreds of good people losing jobs?\"\n“So much for empowering women huh, celebrating Ivanka being dropped… all these celebs are a dime a dozen, pathetic,” added another person on social media. “So this is your way of respecting women? Your entire career is based on making fun of others and fowl language. Just saying.”\nYet while many accused Handler of bullying and sexism, others rushed to her defense.\n\"Bullying is wrong,\" wrote one man on Handler's Facebook page. \"Correct. Standing up for those who are being politically bullied because of their ethnicity, gender, religion and/or sexual orientation is not equivalent to bullying. Come correct next time.\"\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:11:04.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
