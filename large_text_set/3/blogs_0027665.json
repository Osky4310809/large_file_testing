While they are living it up at the sanctuary now, life for these two wasn’t always so peaceful. Valentina and Tomás were rescued after escaping a horrific barn fire. They had been locked inside their pen but managed to maneuver their way out, but not before burning their sensitive hooves. Luckily, they made it out alive and were soon transported to the sanctuary for care. Now the pigs are learning what it means to be loved and have a forever home . \nWhen she arrived at the sanctuary, Valentina had virtually no hooves was walking essentially on her joints. Thanks to the love and patience of the staff at Santuario Igualdad Interespecie, she’s doing much better. Here we see Valentina curled up on her caretaker’s lap just like a happy lap dog. We’re so glad she’s finally getting to experience pure bliss! \n\n\nLooking at this photo, we can’t help but think that there aren’t that many differences that separate pigs from dogs . Pigs learn their names and will come running when called, they are very compassionate and can tell when others around them are in distress – not to mention, they can learn tricks , and, as this little piggy demonstrates, they absolutely love cuddles. \nUnfortunately, most people only think of pigs as “food” animals and never afford them such care or attention. Operating under the assumption pigs are non-feeling, unintelligent beings, they can justify treating them like commodities and subjecting them to horrific lives. Once we step outside of this assumption and see pigs as the individuals they are, everything can change. \nJust as this photo shows, there is nothing Valentina would rather do than spend time with her caretaker. Seeing these two together reminds us that the lines we draw between our pets and other animals are purely invented. All animals deserve the chance to be loved and give love in return. \nTo learn more about Santuario Igualdad Interespecie, check out their Facebook page . \nImage Source: Santuario Igualdad Interespecie /Facebook Want to read more posts like this?
