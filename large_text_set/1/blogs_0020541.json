In this funny clip, the girl is playing the flute with her dog laying on the floor behind her. \nBut as soon as she starts playing, the dog lets out a deep, hysterical howl. She continues to try and play only for the dog to respond even more dramatically! \nI’m not convinced that he’s actually critiquing her as much as singing along! What do you think? One thing for sure, he got me and his family laughing! \nShare this cute   family.
