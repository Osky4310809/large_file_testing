But I feel I have the skills to beat him,” Horn, rated the No. 2 welterweight by the WBO, recently told The Sunday Mail. Sportshub ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 \nHe said Pacquiao is already on the decline and expressed confidence that he can beat the Filipino icon. \n“He's 38 and I'm 28. He's slipped a little from his very best and I think now is a great time to challenge him,” added Horn, a 2012 Olympian who happens to be a qualified school teacher. \nThe fact that the fight could possibly be staged at the Suncorp Stadium in Horn’s hometown of Brisbane will make it sweeter for the boxer. \n“I know with my home crowd behind me, I can realize my dream,” said Horn, whose record is 16-0-1, with 11 knockouts.
