This included two reserve and 10 career soldiers. \nOfficial figures indicate that nine were killed in military accidents, seven died in civilian traffic accidents, 15 soldiers are suspected of having committed suicide, four were killed in action, and six died due to medical reasons. Additionally, some 43 soldiers were severely injured throughout the year. © REUTERS/ Abdalrhman Ismail Over 2,600 Syrians Received Medical Aid in Israel Over 3 Years - IDF The Jerusalem Post quotes a senior officer in the IDF’s Manpower Directorate saying the army has \"a plan to prevent accidents in the army, with education regarding road safety and accident prevention…The IDF attaches great importance to the prevention of injuries and death among its soldiers.\" \nThere were fewer deaths than in the previous decade, particularly with training accidents and suicide. \nThe official added that there were 15 suicides per year from 2014 to 2016, compared to the 20 recorded between 2008-2011. © REUTERS/ Ibraheem Abu Mustafa Israeli Servicemen, Palestinian Militants Exchange Fire Near Gaza Borders - IDF \nThe officer noted, \"There is a very broad suicide-prevention program, not only in the Personnel Directorate, it is shared by many in the military,\" and that \"We have many partners in this area, including commanders who receive training to identify signs of distress, which aim to help them identify soldiers who may need intervention.\" \nCurrently the Israeli army operates two centers for troops in crisis.
