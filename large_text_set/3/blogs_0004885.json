Meet the Racemo and Racemo+, the work of Tamo, a sub-brand introduced by Indian automaker Tata Motors, the company that owns Jaguar Land Rover. \nThe Racemo is essentially a two-door, two-seat coupe that is “race car inspired,” as the company says in its press release. Designed at the Tata Motors Design Studio in Turin, Italy, the version of Racemo without the ‘+’ is the road-going version, while the other is the racing version. \nIt isn’t hard to tell them apart, as the Racemo+ comes with plenty of racing kit stuck to it like aero front and rear bumpers, an adjustable front splitter, rear diffuser a sizeable rear wing, and a racing harness instead of three-point seatbelt on the inside (optional on the Racemo). \nShared cues include a double-bubble roof, long bonnet a wide front intake, a central exhaust outlet and butterfly doors. The cabin is pretty Spartan to suit the racing theme, where fabric door pulls, brightly-coloured switches and trim, and a triple-LCD screen instrument display are standard fitments. \nThe car is built on what Tamo calls a MOFlex Multi-Material Sandwich (MMS) structure, which certainly sounds like a delicious offering, especially when you consider the car gets all around double-wishbones. \nDimension wise, the Racemo measures 3,835 mm long, 1,810 mm wide and 1,208 mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2,430 mm. By comparison, a Mazda MX-5 (ND) is 3,915 mm long, 1,735 mm wide, 1,230 mm tall, with 2,310 mm wheelbase. \nIts small footprint should make it pretty lightweight although no official weight is given. For power, the Racemo comes with 1.2 litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine that provides 190 PS at 6,500 rpm and 210 Nm at 2,500 rpm. \nThe aluminium mill is mid-mounted and mated to a TA6300 automated manual transmission (with paddle shifters). Tamo claims a 0-96 km/h (0-60 mph) time of less than six seconds. Aside from its suspension setup, the Racemo also comes with disc brakes at all four corners, and off-sized alloy wheels (17-inch front with 205/50 tyres and 18-inch rear with 235/45 tyres). \nIt is reported that only 250 Racemos will be built, and if you’re not lucky enough to get one for yourself, you’ll have to settle for the digital version. That’s right, the Racemo is available as a free download for those with a copy of Forza Horizon 3 . Since the Racemo exists in both the physical and digital world, Tamo calls the sports car its “first globally developed ‘phygital’ car.” \nGALLERY: Tamo Racemo+", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-09T01:42:47.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
