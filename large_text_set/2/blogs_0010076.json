The parent noticed an unusually high amount of billing on the child’s Medicaid explanation of benefits, according to Bondi’s office. \nHer Medicaid Fraud Control Unit found Angels Creative Children Therapy had inflated Medicaid invoices, claiming children had received eight hours of one-on-one therapy every day. \n“The children rarely, if ever, received such therapy,” said Florida Attorney General’s Office spokeswoman Kylie Mason. \nNavarro and Benech each face charges of Medicaid provider fraud and organized scheme to defraud. Both charges are first-degree felonies. \nIf convicted, Navarro and Benech face sentences of up to 30 years in prison and fines and restitution in excess of $59,000, Mason said. \ncdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6931  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:21:48.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
