The unit is set to go after drug financiers, manufacturers and distributors. \nAnother body, the National Anti-Illegal Drug Task Force, was also listed in the published document. It will comprise military and police personnel as well as “institutions called upon for assistance by virtue of the order,” the Inquirer says. \nThe signing of the paper on March 6 coincided with new operations by the country’s National Police (PNP). The missions had been put on hold after entire units were suspended over the kidnapping and murder of a South Korean by rogue anti-drug officers.

Of those, 2,555 were killed in what police say were shootouts during raids, according to Reuters. \nA total of 48,000 suspects have been arrested as part of the campaign, according to authorities. \nDuterte's crackdown has led to international criticism, including from the US, EU, human rights groups, and the Catholic Church. Earlier this month, the UN-backed International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) condemned the \" extrajudicial killings.\" \nThe condemnation didn't sit well with Duterte, who on the same day warned of \"more killings.\" \n“I am committed to stop drugs before I go out,” Duterte said, adding that “there will be more killings because they [drug gangs] really fight back.” \nDuterte has frequently lashed out at those who criticize his campaign, calling former US President Barack Obama a \"son of a b**ch/whore\" and giving the European Union a \"f**k you.\" \nHe also called former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon a \"devil.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-11T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T03:50:00.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
