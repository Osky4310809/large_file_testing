Tap on More in the bottom navigation. Scroll all the way to the bottom and tap on Settings and then Account Settings.\n\nNow tap on Security . Tap Where You're Logged In . Here you can view (and end) all sessions for your Facebook account. Tap the X to delete the active session from your account.\n\nIf you see anything suspicious, we'd recommend not only ending the session, but changing your password.\nOne thing worthy of noting is that I've experienced sign-ins from different states and locations periodically that are far away. Many Twitter users reported the same issue and even had some of the same sign-ins I did.\nI think this could be in relation to how Facebook handles logins on different servers but I'm not sure. If anyone else has any insight on this, let us know in the comments!\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:08:43.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
