It's not just the movies either, people are getting hype about the upcoming live-action and animated series' that are slated to debut soon. \nThe X-Men pilot at Fox - supposedly titled 'Gifted' - is gearing up for production, and fans can't wait to see what the series has in store. The show focuses on a family of mutants on the run, but that's about all the information we know so far. \nThanks to a new casting call for extras, some new details regarding the show's plot may have been revealed. \nThis week, MyCastingFile.com unveiled some new parts for potential extras in the pilot episode, and the casting reports had a lot to say about what we'll see in the episode. \nThese are the parts that the site was calling for: High school students at dance, Seedy types at bar, Native Americans at outpost, 4AM diner patrons, Hotel maid, Law office background, Barfly woman, 14-17 year old high school students , and sentinel service techs . \nThe Native Americans casting stands out immediately, as there are a couple of mutants of Native American descent that weren't mentioned as being a part of the cast. Could Warpath be involved in the series? \nThe double calls of high school students reveals that we will see the children of the show's main family in their normal lives, before everything goes haywire. They will have to abandon everything they know in order to go on the run. \nThe other big detail here is the Sentinel tech role. It was known that the show would include the sentinels, but this shows that they will make their debut in the pilot episode. \nThe X-Men TV pilot follows Kate and Reed Stewart, two human parents who discover that their children are mutants. The family is forced to go on the run from an anti-mutant government and eventually meet up with an underground mutant resistance movement led by a mutant called Sam. The government has the mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels, which were previously seen in X-Men: Days of Future Past, at its disposal. Other X-Men from the Marvel Comics universe, including Polaris and Blink, are expected to appear. \n'Gifted' is currently in pre-production and was developed by Matt Nix, who wrote the pilot episode. X-Men movies veteran Bryan Singer will direct. Nix and Singer, along with Lauren Shuler Donner, Simon Kinberg, Jim Chory, and Jeph Loeb will all serve as executive producers. The pilot stars Redford, Stephen Moyer, Amy Acker, Jamie Chung, Sean Teale, Natalie Alyn Lind, Emma Dumont, Percy Hynes White, and Coby Bell. \n\"Gifted\" will be the second X-Men television project to enter production, following the FX drama Legion , which is currently in its first season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-16T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T18:30:39.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
