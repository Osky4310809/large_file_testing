If nothing hits the detector, you're going to get 0, not -1.\nTo solve the dilemma, Soloman and O'Neill emailed NASA.\n\"It's pretty cool,\" Soloman said. \"You can tell your friends, I just emailed NASA and they're looking at the graphs that I've made.\"\nInitially they said they've come across the problem, but they believed it was only happening once or twice a year.\nSo they called on Soloman to give them some help.\nThe student made charts based on low bands of energy and showed it was actually happening multiple times a day.\nPretty cool, isn't it?\nWatch Soloman explain the discovery here:\nWATCH: Robotic glove lets people with limited hand mobility perform daily tasks", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/astro_timpeake", "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/9ycX7dJz.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qptc", "https://twitter.com/spacegovuk", "https://twitter.com/RichardGarriott", "https://twitter.com/ProfBeckyParker/status/844854554675990530", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TimPix?src=hash", "https://t.co/dLd3CtINdD", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/9ycX7dJz.m3u8", "http://www.researchinschools.org/", "https://twitter.com/ResearchInSch", "https://twitter.com/astro_kimbrough"], "published": "2017-03-23T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T18:56:41.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
