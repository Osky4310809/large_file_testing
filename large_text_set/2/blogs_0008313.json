They are 1-0 down and if they don't pick up fairly quickly, reform will be delivered to them.\" \nI would have thought with the state of the NHS, the lack of building, not enough cash for defence, that [MPs] would put energy into that not the organisation of football Keith Compton FA life vice-president \nFA chairman Greg Clarke has said he will quit if the organisation cannot win government support for its reform plans. \n\"I watched the debate and respect the opinions of the MPs,\" he said. \n\"As previously stated, we remain committed to reforming governance at the FA to the agreed timescale of the minister.\" \nCollins suggested ministers should intervene to overhaul English football's governing body because \"turkeys won't vote for Christmas\" and it will not reform itself. \nCrouch warned the FA that if it played \"Russian roulette\" with public money it will lose. \nThe minister also said the government would be prepared to consider legislation if the FA fails to present plans for required reforms before April. However she felt the debate - which was sparsely attended by MPs - was premature given her desire to see the FA's proposals. Media playback is not supported on this device Damian Collins MP: 'We no longer have any confidence' How have we got here? \nThe committee has published two reports since 2010 recommending greater representation at the FA for fans and the grassroots game, as well as more diversity in positions of authority. It also wants to dilute the perceived dominance of the Premier League. \nCollins has said the FA was given six months to meet the government guidance on best practice for sports governance but had failed to do so. That guidance called for things such as a move towards gender equality on boards, more independent oversight, more accountability and term limits for office bearers. \nHe was joined by fellow Tories and Labour MPs - keen to ensure the \"national game\" is run correctly - in bemoaning the current state of the FA. \nThe cross-party motion stated that MPs have no confidence in the FA's ability to comply fully with its duties as its existing governance structures make it \"impossible for the organisation to reform itself\". \nIt was approved unopposed at the end of a backbench business debate, which was attended by fewer than 30 MPs. FA vice-president defends lack of diversity \nThe FA is effectively run by its own parliament, the FA Council, which has 122 members - just eight are women and only four from ethnic minorities. More than 90 of the 122 members are aged over 60. \nShadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: \"Not only is diversity not in the heart of the FA ,it isn't in its body, or even its soul.\" \nLabour MP Keith Vaz, whose constituency of Leicester East is home to the Premier League champions Leicester City, added: \"A quarter of all professional footballers are black, however only 17 of the 92 top clubs have an ethnic minority person in a senior coaching role.\" Only eight of the 122 members of the FA Council are women \nHowever, Keith Compton - one of 25 FA life vice-presidents and a director of Derbyshire FA - questioned why the FA was being discussed in Parliament. \n\"It is pity that the MPs have got nothing better to do,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \n\"I would have thought with the state of the NHS, the lack of building, too many people living in boxes, not enough cash for defence, that some people would put energy into that not the organisation of football. \n\"Football is reforming all of the time.\" \nAsked whether there should be more female and ethnic minority involvement in FA decisions, he said: \"That's not really the responsibility of the council. If those people were interested enough, and we had enough people, we would have enough women and other people on the FA. \n\"I have heard people say supporters aren't represented but that is not true. They have one representative. People want the council to be reduced and now I am hearing it should be increased.\" FA Council member: 'Old, grey-haired men still have a lot to offer' \nResponding to the interview, former FA chairman David Bernstein said: \"I think if you want an argument for change, you've just heard it.\" \nAnd Yunus Lunat, the first Muslim to get a seat on the FA Council before leaving three years ago, said new recruits were needed. \n\"No-one is disputing the contribution the previous generation has made but there comes a time when you have got to recognise that you are not the most suitable people for the role,\" he said. Analysis \nBBC sports editor Dan Roan \nThe debate may have been attended by fewer MPs than is needed for a full football match, but the fact a motion of no confidence in the FA was passed still gives it an embarrassing bloody nose, ramping up the pressure on the governing body. \nThe few MPs who spoke seemed to mostly agree with each other, demanding greater diversity on the council, independent directors and fan representation on the board, and raising concerns over the clout and money of the professional clubs, especially the Premier League. \nBut the people who really matter here are the government. \nThe sports minister said the debate was \"premature\" and reiterated that she may consider the nuclear option of legislation to force through reforms - but only if a threat to cut funding does not work. That however, remains some way off and the FA is confident it can comply with a new code of governance. If it fails, chairman Greg Clarke has vowed to step down and then it really will be in the last-chance saloon.

Reform is therefore required.\" \nJudith Cummins (Labour, Bradford South): \"At best they're dragging their feet, at worst they're wilfully failing to act.\" \nAndrew Bingham, CMS Select Committee member: \"The issues of Sam Allardyce, who manages the (England) team for 67 days, one game, walks away with allegedly around Â£1m, it is destroying people's faith in football.\" \nNigel Huddleston (Conservative, Mid Worcestershire): \"I have a great deal of respect for Greg Clarke but I sense his hands are tied and a sense of institutional inertia pervades the governance of football in this country.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Football changes 'not fast enough' says David Davies Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:20:19.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
