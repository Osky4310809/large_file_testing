They are few and far between out here,” Bryan said. “It’s my first run at all these tournaments out here. I love this place, love this golf course.” The Honda Classic: Articles, photos and videos \nBryan is coming off a career-best T-4 finish at the Genesis Open , a result that vaulted him inside the Official World Golf Ranking top 100 for the first time. On Thursday he made seven birdies despite hitting only 13 greens in regulation for his second sub-65 score in his last three competitive rounds. \nBryan’s experience around the Bear Trap even extends beyond Q-School, as he was a contestant during the season of “Big Break” that was filmed at PGA National in 2014. While he made an early exit from the reality show, he views it as a blessing in disguise. \n“It was actually a great thing to get kicked off the show really early. It gave us a lot of time to return around some of these golf courses,” he said. “I was able to get three or four rounds over here [on the Champion Course] after getting eliminated, so that definitely made things a little bit easier.” Article Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:48:38.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
