Squatters: The group occupied the building last week (YouTube) \nOne man is heard shouting “come downstairs. Get the f*** outside now” as his comrades appear to smash windows - setting alarms off in the property. \nAnother video taken from inside the mansion shows occupants attempting to fend off the group with fire extinguishers. \nOthers are heard shouting for them to keep away from the window as glass is heard smashing nearby. Thugs: The group were allegedly smashing windows (YouTube) \nOne person who had been taking part in the poetry workshop shared pictures of the alleged thugs and wrote: “The moment you are enjoying a fantastic spoken word workshop and your attacked by Nazis....yes Nazis in central London today. \n“There were children in the building too, as they smashed windows.” \nAnd another member of the squatters posted on Twitter: “We are being violently attacked by fascists, get to 102 Eaton Square immediately. Lives are at risk.” Plush property: A Grade II listed £15m building on Belgrave Place, London, has been squatted by the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians (Anal) (David Mirzoeff/PA Wire) \n“The mansion is being secured from inside after attacks by fascists, children are being moved upstairs, no reports of injuries,” said another post. \nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: “Police were called to Eaton Square, SW1, just after 16:15hrs on Saturday, 28 January, to reports of a disturbance involving a group outside a non-residential property. \n“The suspects made off before officers arrived. Officers have conducted local searches and are patrolling the local area. Squatters: Footage shows the group occupying the house trying to barricade the windows (YouTube) \n“There have been no arrests. Enquiries continue.” \nThe group of activists said it wants to use the plush property off Eaton Square to accommodate London’s rough sleepers but added they are likely to be turfed out after a court hearing expected on Tuesday. \nMembers said up to 10 homeless people have slept in the mansion per night and that the group was working with charities to spread the word about the makeshift shelter.
