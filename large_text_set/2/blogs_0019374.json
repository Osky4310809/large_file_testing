This handy Windows feature gives you an overview of what your computer is doing from applications and processes to resource usage. \nWe've told you in the past how to use it to track down programs and apps that are causing computer crashes and other forms of instability . However, there are other things you can do with Task Manager you might not realize, especially in the newer Windows 8.1 and 10 versions. So, let's see what those are. 1. Launching Task Manager \nOK, this one sounds basic, but many people use more steps than needed to launch Task Manager. In fact, if we asked you to launch it right now, you'd probably hit the handy shortcut CTRL + ALT + DEL (also known as the \"three-finger salute\") and then select \"Task Manager\" from the list of options. \nThat works, but did you know you can open Task Manager directly with the shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + ESC? If you have to open Task Manager frequently, dropping that extra step saves you a lot of time over the long run. \nIf you aren't big on keyboard shortcuts , simply right-click on a blank area of the Windows taskbar and select \"Task Manager.\" And if you're looking for some old-school command-line nostalgia, you can hit Windows Key + R (or go to Start>>Run), type the command \"taskmgr\" and hit Enter. \nHint: In Windows 8.1 and 10, the first time you open the Task Manager you aren't going to see very many options. Click the \"More Details\" link in the bottom-left corner of the Task Manager window to get the useful information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:50:55.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
