And also their spouses.”\nAmazon's one of 200 employers, colleges, and labor organizations to register for this type of apprenticeship program, and one of the few major tech companies involved (Tesla's one of the others).\nThe company launched a similar program in the United Kingdom last week, designed to hire veterans for its cloud computing division Amazon Web Services. The first class of trainees in the U.S. program will also work at AWS.\nBONUS: These animals are helping returning soldiers overcome their PTSD", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/49aGVgHr.jpg", "http://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/49aGVgHr.m3u8", "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-restart-training-and-job-placement-in-the-uk/"], "published": "2017-01-21T06:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-21T01:14:23.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
