However, if they are unwilling to do so — as they likely will be — the administration would have to commence a legal battle. \n“The point is not to go around whacking all these little cities and counties, it’s to get them to do the right thing,” Vaughan told USA Today. “And for the die-hards, to confront them.”   \nOne of the biggest weapons of confrontation will come from the Justice Department, especially if led by attorney general-nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions , an outspoken critic of illegal immigration. \nAs attorney general, Sessions could sue sanctuary cities for violating federal law in their refusal to cooperate with immigration enforcement. \nAnother weapon in Trump’s arsenal against sanctuary cities would be his administration’s ability to cut federal funding. \nBoth the Justice Department and Homeland Security could pull grant money that helps local law enforcement agencies hire officers, bolster prosecutions, fund courts, jails, drug treatment programs and crime victim assistance.
