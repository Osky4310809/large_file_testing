But he was released to find another flight after authorities determined it was simply a business dispute, Pedregon said.\nThe passenger was not a threat, Pedregon said, joking that there was “no woodshed on board.”\nThe man has not been identified because, Pedregon said, he was not charged with a crime.\n[ A celebrity dentist claims his anti-Trump joke led to his removal from a plane ]\nThe airport police spokesman told the Los Angeles Times that the passenger asked crew members for a blanket because he was chilly. When he was told what it would cost him, Pedregon said, he became irate and argued he should not have to pay for it because the plane was too cold.\nThe man asked to speak with Hawaiian’s corporate headquarters and, during that call, he told a company representative, “I would like to take somebody behind the woodshed for this,” Pedregon told The Post.\nAnother passenger, George Enriques, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that the man told him: “They’re not treating me right. I’m going to call the president.”\nPedregon said airline staffers felt threatened, so the pilot diverted the plane.\nHawaiian Airlines spokeswoman Alison Croyle said, “We don’t know the demeanor of the passenger, what was said, or the tone.”\nBut, she said, “I think it’s important to put ourselves in the position of the captain, who is in the cockpit about to begin a five-hour flight over the Pacific, when he or she is informed of an issue in the back of the plane. Based on the information they are provided, the call has to be made immediately: What is best for the crew and the passengers on board?”\nIn a statement provided earlier to the media, Hawaiian Airlines said:\nOur flight crews are responsible for the safety and comfort of all passengers on board our flights and the Captain in charge of the aircraft is entrusted with determining when it’s best to deplane an anxious or unruly passenger. Diverting a fight is clearly not our first choice, but our crew felt it was necessary in this case to divert to Los Angeles and deplane the passenger before beginning to fly over the Pacific Ocean.\nCroyle said the airline offers complimentary blankets in all cabins on international flights and on certain red-eye flights.\nBut during daytime flights between the West Coast and Hawaii, blankets are complimentary only in first class and “extra comfort” cabins, she said.\nIn economy, they are available for purchase.\n“I thought it was ridiculous,” Eileen Berstrom, another passenger, told CBS News . “First of all, it costs $12,000 for them to land here, and it’s a $12 blanket.”\n[ ‘This is not Trump’s America!’: Passengers rejoice when man accused of racism is kicked off flight ]\nIn-flight dust-ups are hardly uncommon — but they have increasingly centered on politics, not price tags.\nFollowing the contentious presidential election, America’s divisions have been on full display in a staggering array of situations and spaces — including airplanes.\nLate last year, Delta banned a passenger after he went on a pro-Trump rant.\nIn January, an Alaska Airlines traveler verbally bashed a Trump supporter — and was bounced from the plane.\nThat same month, prosecutors said a traveler attacked a Muslim airline employee, warning her that Trump “ will get rid of all of you .”\nOn a United Airlines flight just last month, a pilot gave a bizarre speech before takeoff — prompting dozens of concerned passengers to flee the plane.\nDays later, passengers rejoiced when a man was kicked off a Houston-bound United flight for causing a disturbance that was blamed on racist comments.\nCellphone footage of the incident showed the man saying that all the “illegals” should be kicked off the plane, moments before he and a woman were asked to collect their belongings and exit the aircraft.\n“Get out of here,” a passenger said. “Racists aren’t welcome in America! This is not Trump’s America!”\nMost recently, a celebrity dentist said he was booted from an American Airlines flight after he made a wisecrack about Trump’s immigration policies.\nRead more:\nThis airline passenger’s pro-Trump rant was caught on video.
