Rocking a red, long-sleeve blouse with a plunging neckline — the perfect frame for her long, silver necklace and pendant — and a red leather skirt with a top-to-bottom zipper, Delevingne looked like her usual badass self, with a sexy ’80s twist.\nMichael Tran/FilmMagic/Getty Images That side-swept hair! The ring pull on the skirt’s zipper! The boxy, power suit-style shoulders on the blouse! It’s all so fabulously ’80s, yet still so current.\nDelevingne was on hand at the event to promote her forthcoming film , Valerian , a sci-fi epic based on a French graphic novel of the same name. In the film, directed by Luc Besson (in the photo with Cara below!) Delevingne plays Laureline, a special operative who must protect the future of humankind. Yeah, nbd.\nThe man, the myth, the legend @lucbesson @valerianmovie #3D \nA post shared by Cara Delevingne (@caradelevingne) on Mar 29, 2017 at 11:02am PDT \nSince Laureline’s aesthetic is not totally dissimilar to Delevingne’s — sneakers, crop tops, badass jackets, and the like — we could picture Laureline rocking this all-red look on the red carpet, if she were a real person, of course. Now to get Cara into a space suit on an average Tuesday…\nA thousand planets. One mission to save them all. Watch the new #Valerian trailer and like this Tweet to explore more.

So mark your calendars for July 21st because this film is going to be epic. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T01:01:22.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
