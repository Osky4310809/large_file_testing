In their treachery, they called on a pair of assassins to murder the Emporer in the deep, dark night. The cutthroats slipped into the royal throne room, their blades shining in the moonlight, and struck, but the Emporer was neither a fool nor a coward. In the company of his royal guard - the dauntless warrior and the savage brawler - the Emporer cast the assassins back into the shadows.
