The new engine, which will debut towards the end of next year, will eschew spark plugs and instead utilise pressure to ignite fuel, Nikkei Asian Review reports. \nThe report says that new mill will be the first practical application of the technology, which is called homogeneous charge compression ignition. No technical details beyond the point that the system apparently ignites the fuel/air mix by subjecting it to pressure, which the automaker says results in more efficient combustion than that found in conventional engines using spark plugs. \nMazda is said to be looking to introduce the new engine – which it is positioning as part of the second-generation of its SkyActiv suite of environmentally friendly technologies – in the new Mazda 3 (or the Axela, as it’s known in its domestic market) next year. The Nikkei report indicates that the unit will eventually be deployed on a wider scale, finding its way on to other models. \nAs for global markets, the company is looking at US and European markets, but says that it has plans to introduce the new engine – which apparently would give the current Mazda 3 a mileage figure approaching 30 km per litre – into developing markets by around 2030.
