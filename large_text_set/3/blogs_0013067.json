(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) Purchase: Order Reprint MILWAUKEE – The Gophers lost to a hot-shooting, physical Middle Tennessee on Thursday 81-72 in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Minnesota’s major-turnaround season came to a quick end in the tournament. The Blue Raiders from Middle Tennessee, despite being a 12 seed, shot the ball well and didn’t back down from the 5-seed Gophers. Middle Tennessee was actually favored in the game. With the Gophers trailing 74-65 with 1 minute, 27 seconds remaining, the Gophers bench was called for a technical foul. Richard Pitino was furious with the official. It was a frustrating half all around for Minnesota. Things were going exactly how the Gophers wanted to open Thursday’s NCAA tournament first round game after a 7-0 start. Minnesota fans were on their feet after Reggie Lynch blocked a shot out of bounds. Minnesota’s Amir Coffey was surrounded by Middle Tennessee’s Tyrik Dixon and Aldonis Foote (45) during the first half Thursday. But the momentum shifted quickly in favor of the Blue Raiders, who lead 37-31 at halftime at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee. Middle Tennessee missed its first five shots of the game, but Giddy Potts hit a three-pointer from the top of the key for his team’s first basket. Amir Coffey nailed his second three-pointer of the game for a 10-7 lead, but the Gophers went scoreless for more than four minutes. Late in the first half, Edward Simpson’s three gave MTSU its biggest lead 37-28 with under a minute left. Dupree McBrayer responded with a shot from beyond the arc to cut it to a six-point halftime deficit. Jordan Murphy had 10 points and four rebounds for Minnesota in the first half. But leading scorer Nate Mason went scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting. Lynch was limited to nine minutes after picking up two fouls early in the half. Minnesota shot 38.5 percent from the field in the first half, while the Blue Raiders shot 50 percent. The Blue Raiders came out of halftime confident and strong. With just over 15 minutes remaining, they took a 14-point lead. The Gophers pushed back with seven minutes remaining, bringing the Minnesota fans in the Bradley Center back to life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:33:27.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
