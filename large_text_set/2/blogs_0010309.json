I don’t think it is easy, because you want to play the competition, but at the same time we have motivation. \n“We play the Europa League, so let’s enjoy the Europa League. We also have a cup final. I don’t believe anyone goes to Wembley not happy to go, so we go, we play. United are now 16 games unbeaten in the league — and two points off second (Photo: Man Utd via Getty) \n“We know in this moment that Southampton are probably going to have some days off. I don’t know if they go to a summer camp to some nice, beautiful place with nice weather to prepare for the final. \n“The only thing I know is their next game is the final and we have to play three matches during this period. We have to train in this cold weather, we have to train on bad pitches at this time, because the weather doesn’t help the pitches. \n“So our situation isn’t easy. But we have to enjoy it, because it’s to play football, it’s to play important matches.” \nLuke Shaw was not in the 18-man matchday squad for the third game in a row, despite being fit. \nBut Mourinho insisted the 21-year-old England left-back, who is facing an uncertain future at United, is not a lost cause. Shaw is fully fit, but could not even get on the bench against Watford (Photo: Man Utd via Getty) \n“He has to work and wait,” said the manager. “Today I wanted one defender on the bench, someone who can play in more than one position. Matteo Damian can play left-back, right-back and as an emergency central defender, so my choice was Damian. \n“The only thing I can say is that Luke is working well. He doesn’t have any problem and it working well. He’s fighting hard. There’s no problem with him. He’s fighting hard.” poll loading Will Manchester United finish in the top four? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:39:03.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
