The current main pitch at Kirkby would have a roof added and be converted into a covered full-size indoor artificial pitch. \nThe new training centre would include a pool and hydrotherapy complex, gymnasium and specialist sports rehabilitation suites. \nCombining the first team and Academy on to one-site has been a long held ambition for the Reds with Jurgen Klopp particularly keen to see the move progress.

Part of Moss Lane between Simonswood Lane and Arbour Lane would have to be closed. \nThe club says it will work closely with local football teams, including Kirkby AFC, on the upgrade of the community pitches so they can host top-level amateur matches with new drainage, changing facilities and car park. Steel containers are currently used as changing rooms while the pitches can often be unplayable due to surface water.
