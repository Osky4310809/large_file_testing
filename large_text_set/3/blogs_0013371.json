In recent interviews, Mr. Mnuchin set a goal of having legislative approval for a new tax package before Congress takes its August break — even as objections to Republican plans for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act threaten to delay that legislation and, with it, the tax modifications. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Donovan has spent nearly 25 years at Goldman, where he worked with companies and individuals both as an investment banking adviser and as an investment management overseer. Through the years, one of his biggest clients has been Bain Capital, a private equity firm whose business involves acquiring and overhauling companies. As an outgrowth of that, Mitt Romney, a Bain founder, became an individual client managed primarily by Mr. Donovan. (A representative for Mr. Romney did not respond to a request for comment.) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A longtime Republican, Mr. Donovan subsequently acted as an economic policy adviser to Mr. Romney during his 2012 presidential campaign and donated thousands of dollars to Mr. Romney’s run, according to federal filings. More recently, Mr. Donovan donated $95,000 to a political action committee that supported Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries last year. \nAdvertisement In addition to his job at Goldman, Mr. Donovan, who lives with his wife and four children in Virginia, teaches corporate strategy and business ethics at the University of Virginia’s law school. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Jason Jones, an associate in a corporate law firm in Salt Lake City who took Mr. Donovan’s courses in law school, said he gave memorable advice on topics like mentoring and time management. In large seminars and in small group meetings with students, Mr. Jones said, the topics ranged from “how do you maintain your sanity as a very successful investment banker” to “how do you view current topics?” “He was willing to talk about anything,” Mr. Jones said. Mr. Donovan joined the Trump transition team after meeting Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, through a friend last year and has spent recent months helping Mr. Mnuchin with Treasury staffing, associates say. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Donovan will tackle not only changes to the corporate and individual tax codes but also the potential restructuring of the government-sponsored mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
