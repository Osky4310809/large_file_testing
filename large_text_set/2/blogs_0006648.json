The Cedars was opened in 2011 after the coalition agreement as part of new family deportation policy that encouraged families to leave voluntarily and gave a higher priority to the welfare of the children involved. \nA new “discrete self-contained unit” at nearby Tinsley House immigration removal centre to handle family deportations is due to open in May. The Home Office is to announce on Friday that G4S has been awarded the contract for the unit, which is initially for 3 years but can be extended to five years. \nThe Home Office contract requires the firm to provide support to children and families while they await their removal, to help them to come to terms with the plans for their return and to help them make preparations for their departure and future resettlement. \nClegg said: “The government’s recent disregard for the welfare and safeguarding of vulnerable children is not the Great Britain I know and admire. First they go back on a promise to accept unaccompanied child refugees from Syria and now they are openly putting innocent children at risk. \n“Charities have been clear that moving families waiting to be deported to Tinsley House is not in the best interests of the children. The truth is, the prison-style environment is not physically safe for children and could impact on their emotional wellbeing. That is exactly why the Liberal Democrats, whilst in coalition, insisted on the establishment of Cedars as suitable accommodation in the first place.” \nIn a letter seen by the Guardian flagging up the G4S decision, Home Office minister Lady Williams says that the key aspects of the welfare support provided to families will remain the same despite the change of provider and the change of location. \nShe insisted that the new pre-departure accommodation at Tinsley House will be used only as a last resort after all voluntary and other return options have failed and an independent family returns panel will be consulted before any family is detained in the unit.
