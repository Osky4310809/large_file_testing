Or Is Trump a Very Clever Fox? Paul Craig Roberts Rages \"The Leftwing Has Placed Itself In The Trash Can Of History\" Feb 5, 2017 10:40 PM 0 \nAuthored by Paul Craig Roberts, \nAt a time when the Western world desperately needs alternative voices to the neoliberals, the neoconservatives, the presstitutes and the Trump de-regulationists, there are none. The Western leftwing has gone insane. \nThe voices being raised against Trump, who does need voices raised against him, are so hypocritical as to reflect less on Trump than on those with raised voices. \nSharon Kelly McBride, speaking for Human Rights First , sent me an email saying that Trump stands on the wrong side of “America’s ideals” by his prohibition of Muslim immigrants into the US. \nMy question to McBride is: \nWhere were you and Human Rights First when the Bush/Cheney/Obama regime was murdering, maiming, orphaning, widowing, and displacing millions of Muslims in seven countries over the course of 4 presidential terms? \nWhy is it OK to slaughter millions of peoples, destroy their homes and villages, wreck their cities as long as it is not Donald Trump who is doing it? \nWhere does Human Rights First get off. Just another fake website, or is McBride seizing the opportunity to prostitute Human Rights First in hopes of donations from the DNC, the Soros’ NGOs, the Isreal Lobby, and the ruling One Percent? \nMoney speaks, and alternative voices need money in order to speak. \nAs so many Americans are indifferent to the quality of information that they get, many alternative voices are thrown back to relying on whatever money is available. Generally, it is the money of disinformation, of information that controls the explanations in ways that favor and enhance the ruling oligarchy. Is this the position in which McBride has placed Human Rights First? \nTurn now to Truthout. This website says that Trump is demonizing Muslims by denying them immigration into the US. \nWhere has Truthout been for the past 16 years? Did Truthout not notice that the George W. Bush regime said “We have to kill them (Muslims) over there before they (Muslims) come over here.” \n\nDid Truthout not notice that Obama continued the policy of “killing them (Muslims) over there”? \nHow insane, how corrupt, does Truthout have to be to say that it is Trump who is demonizing Muslims? \nTrump has not said that he wants to “kill them over there.” He has said that if the masses of peoples we have dislocated and whose families we have murdered want to come here, they might wish to exact revenge. Having made Muslims our enemies, it makes no sense to admit vast numbers of them. \nAccording to Bush and Obama, we are supposed “to kill them over there,” not bring them “over here” where they can kill us as a payback for the murder machine we have run against them. \nThis is common sense. Yet, the deranged left says it is “racism.” \nWhat happens to a country when the alternative voice is even more stupid and corrupt than the government’s voice?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:57:31.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
