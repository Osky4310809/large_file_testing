It was followed by a weird anime anthology and some questionable but profitable sequels ( Reloaded is unwatchable whereas Revolutions is at least interesting bad). Regardless, the visionary writer/directors The Wachowskis could rest easy knowing they had made a huge, positive impact on pop culture before crafting their true cinematic masterpiece Speed Racer .\n\nHowever, because brands can never die, Warner Bros. is threatening to reboot (no pun intended) the Matrix franchise. Details are scarce. Creed star Michael B. Jordan has been floated as a possible headliner which could be okay. But the Wachowskis aren’t necessarily involved yet, which defeats the entire point. If even the Wachowskis couldn’t make good Matrix movies after the first one, why should we trust some outsider?\nThe most concerning tidbit from this Hollywood Reporter scoop , though, is that this might lead to a whole universe of dumb new Matrix movies. Imagine a Morpheus spin-off, a Tank solo film, a movie about Hugo Weaving loving cookies. Like a computer virus, these pointless films could self-replicate for all time destroying everything in their path. I guess WB just wants to fulfill its destiny as Bizarro Disney by having a bad Star Wars counterpart to complement DC; it’s a bad Marvel counterpart. At least an R-rating is a better fit for The Matrix than for Superman.\nIf you think your Matrix nostalgia might cause you to mistakenly think this is a good idea, just watch Keanu Reeves kick butt and be excellent in the new John Wick films instead.\nThe Matrix Trilogy available on Amazon. \nS peed Racer available on Amazon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-15T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-16T03:45:36.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
