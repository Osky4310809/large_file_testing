But fans can’t help but notice his shift in sound – it appears the rapper may well have been heavily influenced by his travels to the UK.\nThe album has a distinctly Brit vibe, with the likes of Skepta, Giggs, Sampha and Jorja Smith popping up on some tracks, although he of course still features his pals Kanye West, 2 Chainz and Young Thug.\nNot bad going bringing out new music while still touring his last album Views, and on the whole people are absolutely loving it.\nBut the sound of his new ‘Brit rap’ hasn’t gone down well with everyone.\nDrake getting on that Brit rap. Dk what to feel bout that 🤔\n— Ritchie (@ritchielhf) March 19, 2017 \nWe let drake turn into a Brit before our very own eyes. What a time to be alive.\n— Jelani (@NevaDyingBroke) March 19, 2017 \nsorry but Drake doin a fake cockney accent isn't the one #MoreLife \n— Lily (@lilfieldz) March 19, 2017 \nSo now Drake is a Brit…I can't with you all \n— Rachaad (@Dre6001) March 19, 2017 \nEveryone's talking about #morelife so I'm listening it and it's bloody identical to all the others Drake's songs. Why are you so excited smh\n— Giuliana (@juliennelapin) March 19, 2017 \nOr is it amazing? Drake's new album is actually great. Probably one of his best\n— NUMERO (@ImNumeroUnoBaby) March 19, 2017 \nBout' one minute into @Drake album like pic.twitter.com/rMsP41vimJ \n— Don P.

Pure gold #drizzy #musicmonday \n— Ismail Mostafa (@isher92) March 19, 2017 \nIt seems to be a bit of everything. This guy is a bit of a genius. Lmao Drake gave us grime, dancehall, R&B, pop, kwaito, soul. All on one album. Madness.\n— overwoke (@Sick_Sage) March 19, 2017 \nAnd there are unexpected upsides to this new music. Thanks to Drake I know have Instagram captions for dayssss\n— S O F I E (@sofiesvanikier) March 19, 2017 \n\nHave a listen:\n\nThe album was released across several streaming devises, rather than just on Apple Music as was thought.\nDrake recently told the crowd of his Leeds gig: ‘I’m excited, ‘cos I’m about a week-and-a-half, two weeks away from finishing this project I’m working on called More Life.\nMARCH 18 \nA post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 13, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT \n‘So you know what that means, right? All that means is I get to drop a new project, and at some point, I get to be back with my people in Leeds one more time.’\nIt waits to be seen how he’ll celebrate this one, given that he celebrated one night of his tour with £500 worth of Nandos chicken , and another with £1000 worth of pizza , and over £30k on an after party. \nWe think this is a dazzling story and so do you!
