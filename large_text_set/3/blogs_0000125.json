who has a son with Down's syndrome - considered \"A World without Down's\" . \nIn the programme, she gave the example of Iceland, where almost all pregnancies are screened for Down's and the termination rate is 100%. \nHowever, the SLDO study suggested this trend was not being reflected in Scotland. \nIt claimed women in Scotland were less likely to end a pregnancy after the diagnosis than those in England and Wales, where the rate is 90.1%. \"Lower screening rates\" \nSue Buckley, of Down's Syndrome Education International, welcomed the apparent decrease in terminations in Scotland. \nHowever, she said it remained important to raise the ethical issues surrounding the new test. \nSpeaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adam's Programme, she questioned the Scottish figure of 97.3% in the 1990s from a previous study. \nShe said this may have been skewed by a small sample size and lower screening rates. \nShe said: \"In England and Wales, where we keep very good data, it's been stable at between 90 and 91%. \n\"You have to look at the data very carefully. \n\"I believe there's only around 60 babies born annually in Scotland with Down's syndrome, so we're not looking at large numbers.\" Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Amniocentesis is usually guided by ultrasound \nThe latest research was based on the results of all 26,261 prenatal invasive tests in Scotland between 2000 and 2011. \nIt found that 92% of the tests showed no foetal abnormality, while 5.6% were diagnosed with chromosomal anomalies, most commonly Down's syndrome. \nProf Cooper said: \"As the NHS moves towards implementation of further non-invasive testing for Down's syndrome, disabled peoples' organisations and parents have argued for a greater consideration of the ethical dimensions of policy. \n\"Studies such as this show that the decision to terminate is informed by a range of factors, and good-quality information should be available to enable parents to make informed decisions.\" \nThe Nuffield Council on Bioethics has been considering ethical issues surrounding the new test. \nIt has warned that some of the private clinics which currently offer the procedure do not offer enough advice and support .
