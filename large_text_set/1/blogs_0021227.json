  \nJurgen Klopp has promised his under-pressure Liverpool side are desperate to set up a showpiece EFL Cup final... even if it didn’t look like it. \nHe claims that no one has taken the competition more seriously than the Anfield club, even if the lethargic display from his team in their semi-final first leg at Southampton two weeks ago suggested they didn’t care. \nThe Liverpool manager admits his team are at a low ebb after a devastating first home defeat in a year at the weekend, quick seemed to mortally wounded their title hopes. \nYet he vowed they will pick themselves up and be motivated to over-turn a 1-0 deficit against Saints on Wednesday night – and in all likelihood set up a dream final against Manchester United at Wembley next month.

But it’s not because of motivation or readiness. We will be ready on Wednesday,” he said defiantly. \n“We want to be in the final, which will be really difficult against Man United - probably [the Red Devils take a 2-0 lead to Hull on Thursday for the second leg of the other semi]- but it’s still possible. I don’t even have to say it. \n“We wanted to win the competition last year, when we reached the final [losing to Manchester City on penalties]. Our brain functions well enough to remember this. Of course we want to be part of the final but don’t just want that, we want to go and win it. \n\"The first step is to beat Southampton.” \nKlopp has frequently been criticised for his team selections in both the EFL and FA Cups, but he has always argued that he picks a team to win the match in front of them, based on fitness and freshness. Klopp's men are lucky to still be in the tie as the first leg could easily have ended 3-0 (Photo: Reuters) \nIt has served him well in cup competitions, with a third final in just 16 months at the club waiting if Liverpool can turn around the single-goal deficit they were fortunate to escape St Mary’s with. \nWhile some have questioned whether that display – when Southampton could so easily have won 3-0 – shows Klopp’s team doesn’t really care about this competition, he fired back: \n“If you saw us celebrating after the quarter-final, we were really happy to go to the semi-final. For us, we don’t judge this tournament. It’s the earliest possibility in a season [to win silverware] but we don’t care. \n“It looks like they pressed the EFL Cup in between parts of the season, nobody seems to care about it - the Premier League does not care about it, because we play Wednesday night and then have to play Saturday lunchtime [a 12.30pm kickoff at home to Wolves in the FA Cup].

So there is nothing else we can do now, we have to win.” \nKlopp doesn’t see the EFL Cup as a consolation prize either. \nWhile just about everyone has already handed the title to Chelsea, he is adamant the Premier League is not over... and his side can still have a massive say in the race. \n“We’re still close enough to fight for nearly everything. OK, if Chelsea wins every game then we cannot fight, but for the rest we can,” he added. \n“You can see we have the quality to fight for the Champions League. We are good enough to do this, and then if we are close enough to the top at the end of the season maybe we can fight for even more. \n“Let’s judge it when it’s done and not feel already, 'Oh my God, again’. Who can deal with a run like Chelsea have been on? We played them once and beat them, so we’re not responsible for their position. We did what we could until now.” View gallery \nKlopp could spring a surprise by throwing centre-back Joel Matip straight back into action after he was cleared by FIFA to play following a dispute with Cameroon over his Africa Cup of Nations participation. \nSkipper Jordan Henderson is also available in midfield despite a heel injury, and Klopp will name his strongest line-up to try to set up what would likely be a showpiece final against Man United. LIVERPOOL vs SOUTHAMPTON PROBABLE TEAMS \nLiverpool Karius; Clyne, Lovren, Matip, Milner; Wijnaldum, Henderson, Lallana; Origi, Firmino, Coutinho. \nSouthampton Forster; Cedric, Stephens, Yoshida, Bertrand; Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Clasie; Redmond, Rodriguez, Tadic. LIVERPOOL vs SOUTHAMPTON MATCH FACTS \nThis is the fifth time Liverpool have gone into a League Cup semi's second leg behind – on the last two occasions they have recovered to reach the final, doing so against Crystal Palace in 2000/01 and Sheffield United in 2002/03. \nLiverpool haven’t lost back to back League Cup matches since 2005, when they were beaten by Chelsea in the February final then suffered a third-round defeat to Crystal Palace in the October .
