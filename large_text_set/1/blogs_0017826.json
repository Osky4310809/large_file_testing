So if you meet a new four-legged friend and you think they’re the cat’s meow, don’t worry! You are able to take them home with you.\nAccording to a spokesperson for the humane society, cat yoga is “sweeping the country,” and it was the the shelter’s director, Jen Swanson, who had the idea to bring these yoga classes to the shelter.\nThe initial idea was for staff and volunteers to take part in the bonding experience, but they decided to allow the public to take part in these brand new yoga classes as well.\nOn top of the cat yoga, the humane society will also offer family yoga classes, teen yoga classes, adult classes, and chair yoga classes – which are for those who cannot stand or have mobility issues.\nClick here for more information on the yoga classes being offered by the Humane Society of Harford County. \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T01:48:39.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
