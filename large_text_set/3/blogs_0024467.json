Emergency C-section , six months without sleep, solo travel with a screaming baby , a milk-duct in my left breast that grew to the size of a Granny Smith , etc. Nothing we all haven't (barely) survived.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/x9ChQV7-wHLfl1btPAwIiOwx_UU/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/03/22/773/n/24155406/b575e519bd331845_StockSnap_T0HUGD2ORR.jpg", "https://boomdash.com/the-in-between/inspire/mom-complaints-having-kids"], "published": "2017-03-22T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T23:53:05.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
