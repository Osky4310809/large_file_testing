There's also a rewind feature to ease the burdens of tricky platforming sequences and an in-game museum for Disney fans and video game historians.\nIt's worth noting: Capcom's mobile ports of the first six Mega Man games — released in Jan. 2017 — were a disaster. This TouchArcade review sums it up very well. You might want to wait and see how The Disney Afternoon Collection fares with critics before plunking down your $20.\nJust a priest, rabbi and atheist smoking weed together\nJames Corden attempting an NCAA bracket is so hilariously British\nPixar visits the Land of the Dead in first 'Coco' teaser trailer\nSeth Meyers won't let Rep.
