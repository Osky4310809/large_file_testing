Actually, that's not true. There's only one thing that does. And that is morning sex. Yes, rise and bang is really the best way to start the day. Some people feel otherwise, with morning breath and whatnot. But, if you are one of the latter, not much for a quickie first thing in the morning, maybe you should reconsider. Here's why... Morning sex does a better job of waking you up than caffeine. Yes, that's true. The rush of blood and oxygen does a great job at waking up the brain, minus the ill effects of coffee or tea. An orgasm is good for your health at any time of the day, so why not start the day with all the various health benefits that climaxing comes with? You'll start the day on a positive note . Isn't that the key to having good days? This is why a morning routine with some self-care woven into it is recommended. A pleasant morning sets the tone for the rest of the day, and is, in fact, a key ingredient of staying youthful! Bonding with your partner first thing in the morning can't be a bad thing. We struggle to find time for our loved ones these days. As the day starts, we get bogged down with work, and other commitments. Come night time, you are exhausted and your brain is occupied with the events of the day. Morning sex is unadulterated by the trivialities of life. Nothing but your lover is on your mind. You'll be glowing the rest of the day! Sex makes the skin glow. We know this. If a good pounding is a part of your morning routine, it will leave you with an enviable afterglow for the rest of the day. Goodbye, highlighter! It is more intimate. Having sex at night is predictable, and even expected. It is the norm. We clean ourselves, shower off the day, and slip into bed for some coitus to mark the end of the day. But, sex in the morning is characterised by morning breath and messy hair, and that's the beauty of it. If you can feel lustful for someone when they are halfway between sleepy and awake, then you can feel lustful for them at any time. You have broached the boundary of \"proper.\" You have embraced their morning wood and un-brushed teeth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:10:11.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
