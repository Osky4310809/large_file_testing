Facebook \nIt's the start of a new year and you may be hitting the gym hard. Developing a healthier lifestyle doesn't happen overnight and the process can be quite arduous. Yes, burgers and fried chicken will always have a place in hearts (and stomachs), but cutting back on the fat and grease goes a long way toward a better diet. Just because certain foods are good for you, though, doesn't mean they have to be devoid of flavor. The following dishes are both healthy and delicious. \nThe poke craze hit Chicago last year—starting with Aloha Poke Co. —and made lunch worth looking forward to again. Washington, D.C.-based salad chain Sweetgreen also arrived, bringing excitement and variety to fresh veggies. Other popular restaurants, such as Beatrix and Native Foods Cafe, offer spins on classic comforts that won't bust the gut. So don't limit yourself the next time you eat out. There are plenty of healthy choices that don't taste like rabbit food at these spots below. 1 Aloha Poke Co. \n2016 was the year of poke in Chicago and it was a welcome change of pace. Lunch became exciting (and healthy) again, thanks in large part to the expansion of Aloha Poke Co. Now with three locations, the restaurant is able to reach more customers who crave its popular Hawaiian bowls. Guests choose a base (white rice, brown rice, mixed greens), type of poke (ahi tuna, salmon, tofu) and load up on a variety of toppings. Or if that’s too much decision-making, there are pre-built creations like the signature Aloha (pineapple, cucumber, scallion, jalapeno, Maui onion, sesame vinaigrette).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-18T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-18T07:15:53.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
