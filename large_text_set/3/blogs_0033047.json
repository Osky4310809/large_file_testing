The council chairmen are trying to pay salaries and embark on capital projects,” he said. \nThe breakdown of the N1.3billion shared among Bayelsa State councils, according to the state Local Government Ministry include Brass, N158,576,807, Ekeremor, N182,266,517, Kolokuma/Opokuma, N122,691,315, Ogbia, N157,919,805, Sagbama, 155,484,429, Nembe, N147,901, 618, Southern Ijaw, N209,402,543 and Yenagoa, N199,170,919. \nEarlier in his speech, Mr Angese described the Brass council Chairman, Mr Bello Bina as media friendly Chairman, “Our visit to the council Chairman is to encourage him to keep up the good works and remain focus.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-30T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T02:13:12.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
