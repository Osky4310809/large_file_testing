He has always talked about how close he is to his mother and that she is his sounding board. Itâ€™s so adorable to see the close bond they share. Yesterday was his mumâ€™s birthday and KJo took to Twitter to wish her for it. PS â€“ You can also spot his BFF Aditya Chopra in the picture. Yes, itâ€™s that rare occasion. Happy birthday to the love of my life!!! My mom!!!
