Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik have given us one of the first tracks, Don't Wanna Live Forever , and now they have a dark, sultry an oh-so angsty video to go along with it. \nThe video has all the trappings of a Fifty Shades extravaganza. There are masks, lingerie, feathers, fancy hotels (the video was filmed in St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London), elevators, fabulous red lipstick and more. Part of Fifty Shades Darker will see Christian and Ana apart (you all remember that surprising Fifty Shades of Grey ending), and we'd be surprised if I Don't Wanna Live Forever isn't in that part of the movie. \nWe'll have to wait until the movie opens in theaters on Feb. 10. You can scroll through photos from the film below. Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-27T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-27T17:29:32.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
