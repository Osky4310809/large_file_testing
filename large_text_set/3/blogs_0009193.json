Then we must determine what tasks they can perform, for example, in remote communities,'' AP quoted the pontiff as saying. \nThe proposal has been around for decades but came under the spotlight again this year as a result of Pope Francis’ apparent positive reaction to the suggestion made by Brazilian clergy. \nBrazilian Cardinal CláudioHummes is pushing the request to combat the reported shortfall of 100,000 priests needed in the country. \nREAD MORE: ‘Empty moments’: Pope Francis has questioned God’s existence, calls himself a ‘sinner’ \nPope Francis also repeated concerns to the German newspaper, Thursday, around the rise of populism, stating that “populism is evil and ends badly as the past century showed.” \nMeanwhile, the Vatican press office revealed Friday the pope is donating €100,000 ($106,090) to those living in poverty-stricken circumstances in the war-ravaged Syrian city of Aleppo. It's not clear at this stage who exactly will qualify for the funds or how many people will benefit.
