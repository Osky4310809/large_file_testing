Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/AP Reuters in Ottawa   01.46   \nJustin Trudeau , under fire for holidaying on a Caribbean island owned by the Aga Khan, has revealed he flew there by private helicopter – an apparent breach of official ethics rules. \nThe Canadian prime minister, 45, came to power in November 2015 promising to run an open and accountable administration but has been dogged by repeated questions about his luxury Bahamas vacation over the new year, which his officials first declined to talk about. \nOpposition legislators have said the holiday was inappropriate since Ottawa helps fund the Aga Khan’s foundation and shows Trudeau is out of touch with ordinary Canadians at a time when the economy is struggling.

Dawson has already opened a preliminary inquiry into opposition complaints about the vacation. \nTrudeau faces a separate probe by Dawson into fundraising by his Liberal party . Last week he scrapped a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos and announced the cross-country tour.
