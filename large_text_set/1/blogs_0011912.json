Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim hammered the ball in all parts of Wellington to dismiss any chance of a hosts‘ revival. Bangladesh, heading into Day Three are in the driver’s seat, while New Zealand will be wary of the fact that one mistake from here on can spell doom for them. Bangladesh are 542 for 7 in their first innings, with 3 more days remaining. \nShakib’s record-breaking double-century : Shakib, who survived a windy and rainy Day One, came out to bat with a defensive approach. Shakib, after being dropped by Mitchell Santner late yesterday, ensured he did not offer any more chances to the hosts. Apart from being frigidly early into the session, Shakib pounced on anything that was to be put away. Shakib also had luck to thank, as he was involved in a mix-up with Mominul Haque early into Day Two. \nFull Cricket Scorecard: Bangladesh vs New Zealand, 1st Test Wellington \nShakib, in particular, was heavy on Southee, who was guilty of bowling one too many short balls. Shakib showed resilience to anchor Bangladesh’s innings after the fall of Mominul, then forming a commendable stand with Mushfiqur Rahim. \nShakib en-route all the cuts and drives got up to his 20th Test fifty in 86 balls. Shakib surpassed many a record with his knock. Shakib, after his fifty, started scoring boundaries at will. Soon, in no time, Shakib rocked his way towards a memorable Test hundred in 150 balls. \nWith nothing to worry, Shakib went on an onslaught and smashed his way to his first ever score of 150 in Tests. Shakib then went on to score his maiden double-ton. \nShakib recorded the third ever double-ton for Bangladesh and soon surpassed Tamim Iqbal’s score of 206. Shakib’s innings came to an end after Neil Wagner bowled him. \nMushfiqur Rahim plays captain’s knock : Coming from an injury, Mushfiqur Rahim showed no signs of complacency in the middle. Mushfiqur came out with Bangladesh placed at a crucial juncture. Mushfiqur played with composure and grit, taking body blows every. \nMushfiqur displayed calmness during his knock, achieving 16th Test half-century. Mushfiqur’s innings comprised of his trademark drives and sweeps -shot that further added frustration to the Kiwi bowlers. \nMushfiqur, after a flurry of boundaries, went into the nervous 90s. Mushfiqur, in a moment of uncertainty, found a boundary via an outside edge. This was Mushfiqur’s fourth and third overseas ton. Mushfiqur continued to time boundaries with perfection and pile on misery over a tired New Zealand attack. \nMushfiqur’s innings finally came to an end at 159. \nNew Zealand’s late resurgence : After being hammered for 259 by the pair of Shakib and Mushfiqur, New Zealand finally had something to cherish late into the day.Their three-man pace attack did the trick, knocking over Mushfiqur, Shakib and Mehedi Hasan in quick succession. Mushfiqur and Shakib’s wickets were result of fatigue and lapse of concentration. \nBoth Mushfiqur and Shakib went for shots away from their body that led their downfall. Neil Wagner rounded off the procession by picking up Mehedi for naught. New Zealand still can restrict Bangladesh below 600 if they smudge over the tail early into Day Three.   13, 2017 10:27 PM   13, 2017 10:33 PM IST TOPICS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T02:52:38.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
