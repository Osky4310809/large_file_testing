King Crimson fan. I handle the news around here. Posted 14 hours ago 15 Way back in 1968, ZZ Top guitar champ Billy Gibbons and his old psychedelic band The Moving Sidewalks had a rare honor of opening for Jimi Hendrix on his very first headlining US tour. This trek sparked a friendship that was crowned with Jimi giving young Billy a special gift - a pink Strat. Remembering the old days, Billy described Jimi as a surprisingly shy guy, singling out one guitar-related thing Jimi doesn't get enough credit for. Mr. Gibbons tells Total Guitar : \"Jimi took the three-way toggle switch into five-way. He's the one that discovered the in-between positions and in order for that not to pop out of place, he showed me how to take off the back scratch plate and remove the spring within the toggle switch, so it would more or less stay in place! And that sound had this extra chimeyness to it. \"I don't think he was credited enough for that. There were lots of little things about him, and all very important to how we see the Stratocaster or even the instrument in general through his applied skills.\" Previously discussing that pink Strat, Billy noted: \"This is the first five-way toggle switch that I ever saw. He took the springs off the standard switch so that it just hung there. When he wanted to move it out-of-phase, Jimi'd shake the guitar until the switch moved, smooth as can be, into the position.\" Jimi and The Moving Sidewalks. Billy is the one in the middle wearing white. Talking about what was Jimi like in private, Billy noted: \"Offstage he was, quite surprisingly, somewhat of a shy character. You could say he was almost a retiring person... until you put a guitar in his hands. And when he stepped into the light, it was a different story altogether. He became a showman and a guitar pyrotechnics extraordinaire. He was doing things with his Fender Stratocaster that certainly the designers never intended. \"Through his genius, the invisible became instantly visible. I took those late-night lessons right into the early days of ZZ Top to the present. And I suppose you could say, with all that backstage carousing in those days... well, not a moment was lost!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-03T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-03T07:03:26.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
