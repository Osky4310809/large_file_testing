That’s something we should all applaud, even if it’s not a moment you had given much thought to. \nYou might be thinking, “Ummm, Kellen, almost every phone last year launched with USB Type-C, so why does the Galaxy S8 get credit?” Because the Galaxy S7, a phone that sold in massive amounts in 2016 and crushed sales of the phone you are holding right now, had microUSB. Even if the LG G5 and V20, Google’s Pixel, the HTC 10, the Moto Z family, OnePlus 3 line, and almost any other phone that launched had USB Type-C, it doesn’t really matter. The king of Android phones (in terms of volume) is the Galaxy S line and it still featured the older, more frustrating plug. \nSo when the Galaxy S8 shows up with a USB Type-C port, the hundreds of accessory makers around will be all-in as well. They’ll have to be. We’ll fully take that next step towards Type-C saturation, where everything in your life can be the same plug (again). Only this time, it’ll be a cable that you can plug-in in the dark without looking, that’ll charge your stuff fast, and transfer data faster. When you head to the wireless carrier to buy a new phone in 2017, you’ll get to choose from phones that should all have the same USB Type-C port (unless you buy one of those app jukeboxes that lacks innovation). From the S8 to the G6 and Pixel or Moto phone, it’ll be Type-C. \nBut maybe more importantly, your house gets to become USB Type-C. I sort of bring this up today because my wife gave up on her Galaxy S7 hours ago (probably because I had it running beta software and the bugs weren’t exactly providing a lot of love) and switched over to a Google Pixel. That means our house is now 100% on the same charger and cable. I cannot express to you how great this moment is. When we pack for a trip, we no longer have to cover all charger types or make sure each other has a charger for each other’s phone. Nope, now we just grab whatever charger is there and go because it’ll work with either of our phones now that microUSB has been removed. In the car, we no longer have to sift through cables to find the correct type. In the bedroom, office, or kitchen, that cable lying there just works. That battery pack only needs one cable ever attached to it going forward. Good lord, it’s glorious. \nRight now, you might not think that this is that big of a deal. Trust me, by the end of the year, assuming you and whoever else you live with bought new phones, you’ll think back, toss a nod this way, and join us in pouring some out for our old friend, microUSB. The end is near, buddy. Post navigation Previous Story Tim’s Favorite Tech Stuff Right Now PKells \nWhen I got my S7 edge I didn’t really care about the wireless charging, but I gotta say it’s now my preferred way of charging. In car, office, and home nightstand. Only plug in when I’m in a pinch and need super fast charging. So USB C isn’t a big deal for me…just keep the wireless charging. Jeff “BIG RED” \nGrateful so much has changed from the Nexus 6p launch. Back when it was difficult to find USB C cables! exvirgo \nFor me anyway, Samsung is not the arbiter of the USB C era. SavageOfThe26 \nWhile only briefly using the note 7, I had gotten used to the type c. When I got the s7 edge, I had to actually start paying attention which way I was inserting the cable in again. dejackamo \nI thought once I got a phone that uses type C that I would understand the hype…That day has come and passed and still don’t give 2 shits about having it Drew \nIt’s nice when it’s dark and you can plug your devices in without much effort VAVAMk_2 \nI for one welcome our new USB C overlords. DILNaOH \nCan we please get a dual USB-C car charger? My wife and I both have Pixels, and it would be awfully handy. Murphy’s Magnet \nThat just proves that it isn’t popular enough yet. southerndinner \n“When you head to the wireless carrier to buy a new phone in 2017, you’ll get to choose from phones that should all have the same USB Type-C port (unless you buy one of those app jukeboxes that lacks innovation).” \nFunniest thing I’ve read today. Suicide_Note \nI guess the guys at DL are desperate for clicks this month, because this article is utter drivel. Samsung is late to the party, nothing more than that. Murphy’s Magnet \nMeh. I’ll just have a bigger variety of cables. I’d have a couple of phones with type c, an iPhone cable and micro USB for 2 phones, 4 tablets, 4 Bluetooth speakers, 6 pairs of Bluetooth headphones, 6 wireless chargers, 7 portable chargers and 3 vaporizers. \nWhile USB C is an upgrade, it isn’t something that everyone is going to just go all in on right now. Maybe by 2019 or 2020 things will switch over completely, but until then we all just have more cables to worry about. MicroNix \nAnd right about 2021, the next OMG cable (still laugh at the OCD here over cables) will come out and render this one obsolete. In electronics there’s no such thing as future-proof. Murphy’s Magnet \nOf course. By the time QC 2.0 was out someone was already releasing QC 3.0 and now 4.0. Wireless charging is making the same kinds of jumps. \nI’ve never had an issue with different cables, I think I still have some stuff that uses mini USB. It can make it pain to travel or you can just get an all in one cable that works with just about everything. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IR130F0/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_PBoPybN77ST1M Drew \nI really don’t think the physical size of USB C will change for at least 10 years… Jeff “BIG RED” \nMicro USB was around for awhile. Don’t see USB C changing in the next 5-8 years. illregal \nsamsung, behind the times as usual. Murphy’s Magnet \nOh yeah, they’ve always been SO behind other companies. It is shame they’ve never been first to market with anything in design or software. /S Tyler Durden \nI wasn’t a fan of it in the Note 7. Felt flimsy and it was only USB 2.0. \nHopefully it’s USB 3.0, and Quick Charge 4.0. \nLast year they gimped QC 3.0 right? Because they didn’t want US version to be faster or something than their international. Hopefully they don’t do that again. Tyler Durden \nYeah they wanted “parity” as they said. Pretty ridiculous but we can hope it utilizes all the features of the 835. FAL_Fan \nInteresting, I didn’t find it flimsy on either of my Note 7’s…it’s not flimsy on my crappy V20 either. Bad port perhaps? Tyler Durden \nIt was a bad all around phone so possibly FAL_Fan \nMan, even with its explosive potential it was still a better phone than the V20. Duffman \n#NotPaidBySamsung… r ght! Cnote11 \nI’m shopping for a new laptop for work and surprised to see that none of the big windows vendors are including type C on their machines as standard – they all still use type A, except for a one-off model here and there. bull3946 \nIt’s all pointless if Samsung’s rapid charge is in tow. It’s not USB C spec compliant and can actually damage emarked USB C cables. \nIt’s just going to add gas to the tire fire that is USB C. Masri87 \nNot sure I care about Samsung products anymore man. They are played out. illregal", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:47:24.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
