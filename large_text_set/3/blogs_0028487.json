The phone rings. You pick it up and say “hello.” There’s a brief silence and then a woman’s voice says, “Oh, hi there!” She offers an embarrassed laugh. “I’m sorry, I was having a little trouble with my headset!” \n....This is a new and highly sophisticated racket known as the “can you hear me” scam, which involves tricking people into saying yes and using that affirmation to sign people up for stuff they didn’t order. \nTake my advice: never interact in any way with telemarketers, silicon or otherwise. Don't say \"I'm not interested.\" Don't say anything. Just hang up. Period. Get the scoop, straight from Mother Jones. Looking for news you can trust?
