Megan Anderson knows how to take advantage of that mic. Here's her message to Dana White. pic.twitter.com/rNydLt77hi — Josh Sánchez (@jnsanchez) January 15, 2017 \nLooked at as the top prospect at featherweight, Anderson was once again an imposing force while facing Tweet, who was taking her second shot at Invicta gold after falling to Cyborg in 2015. \nBest known for her outpouring of offence on the feet, Anderson was on the attack early and often in the opening round, although she did get stung by a counter punch from Tweet that backed her off during one of the first few exchanges. \nWhile Tweet did a good job staving off Anderson’s attacks in the first round, the Australian striker made a few adjustments before storming out of the gate in the second. \nAnderson bloodied Tweet with her onslaught of punches and with her opponent constantly backing up and just trying to play defence, she knew this fight was going to be over soon. \nAnderson opened up with a barrage of shots as Tweet’s face was quickly covered in blood after her nose seemingly exploded from some of the punches she was eating while doing her best to cover up. \nTweet’s only counter were a pair of spinning back fists, which both came up short, but the second ultimately back fired as Anderson slammed home a huge punch followed by a left high kick that blasted the veteran featherweight directly in the face. \nTweet turned away and covered her face as the referee quickly swooped in to stop the carnage before Anderson could unleash any more damage on her defenceless opponent.

January 15th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/More Sports/ Fight over, guy keeps punching \nHeading into the fight it was already rumoured that the winner could get a quick call up to the UFC as the promotion tries to build a fledgling featherweight division without many legitimate 145-pound fighters currently available. \nAnderson would certainly be at the top of the list as she gets her fourth straight win by knockout or TKO and it didn’t take the new champion long to send a message to UFC president Dana White. \n“I just want to say, hey Dana White — you tell Holly (Holm) or Germaine (De Randamie) to keep my belt warm cause I’m (expletive) coming for it,” Anderson said following the win. \nHolm and De Randamie are scheduled to meet in the main event at UFC 208 in Brooklyn to determine the first ever UFC women’s featherweight champion. \nWith Cyborg currently sidelined on temporary suspension after testing positive for a banned substance, it’s hard to imagine the UFC won’t move quickly to bring Anderson over for a potential showdown with the winner of that title fight at some point in 2017. \nThis story originally appeared on Fox Sports US.
