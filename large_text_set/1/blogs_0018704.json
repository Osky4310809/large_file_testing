Instead, it ended up collecting dust in a storage unit and wound up in Thibodeau’s possession because the owner was delinquent on payments. \nThibodeau said he thinks the sign could fetch somewhere between $25,000 and $60,000. \nThe Whisky a Go Go got its start with dancing, as the name suggests, but live music quickly became a staple. The Doors were a house band in the late 1960s, and other acts including the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield helped to cement the club’s reputation, said Todd Mesek, from Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \n“It got this reputation as this great place for the hottest new bands, with a lot of street cred, and for being the place to be for new music,” he said. \nThe club with a capacity for 500 people faded a bit in the 1970s as big rock ‘n’ roll bands played larger venues, like arenas and stadiums, before getting a second wind during the punk era in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Ramones, the Runaways and Blondie, Mesek said. \nThen came the big metal bands of the 1980s, including Van Halen, Motley Crue and Guns N’ Roses. In the 1990s, grunge bands like Soundgarden and the Melvins played there. \nThe venue was recognized by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.
