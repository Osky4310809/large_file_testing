Specifically, a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7. \nHowever, as confirmed earlier today, that (PRODUCT)RED branding won’t be in place on the red variants sold in China . Expectations are that Apple wanted to avoid any controversy in the country, specifically with the government. So, questions arose regarding whether or not Apple would still be donating the funds earned from those red iPhone7 sales to the Global Fund, as is the point of any (PRODUCT)RED partnership. \nMacRumors got a response from Apple CEO Tim Cook: \n“MacRumors’ question : We noticed the (PRODUCT)RED branding is missing from the new red iPhone 7 on the China Apple website. Will you be donating any of the proceeds from the phone’s China sales to the HIV/AIDs cause anyway? \nTim Cook’s response : We donate to the Global Fund on every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus we sell in every country in the world.” \nSo, while Apple won’t be promoting (PRODUCT)RED in China, it will still donate to Global Fund as a result of any red iPhone 7 sales in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T19:12:46.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
