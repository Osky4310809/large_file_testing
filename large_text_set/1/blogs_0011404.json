Last year was successful. I don’t know if we’ll do it again. I think maybe we’ll release some of it earlier than we did. But I just started writing it, I haven’t even cast it yet — except for Sarah and Evan. It’s a modern-day story. That’s all I can say.”\nYet earlier, FX CEO Landgraf indicated that he indeed plans to continue keeping things mysterious moving forward. “It actually will be shrouded in super secrecy,” he said. “Ryan has yet another really innovative idea for how to do something fresh and different with the franchise that audiences haven’t seen before, and there’s a marketing promotional hook around that.”\nIt was a big day for AHS in general. The horror anthology was renewed for two more cycles on top of its upcoming seventh season — so the series should continue through 2019, making it FX’s longest-running dramatic series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T02:09:06.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
