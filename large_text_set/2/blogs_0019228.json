They fired several shots into the air and into the vehicle's cab before the driver was arrested, according to officials. \nSome of the canisters were lost from the back of the vehicle during the chase, injuring at least one pedestrian.

The extent of his injuries was immediately unclear. \nThe incident instantly raised fears of terrorism, coming after truck attacks in Berlin, Germany and the French city of Nice that have shattered the continent's peace. \nThe evidence, however, \"does not suggest that the incident involving the butane cylinders' truck is terrorism,\" Barcelona police chief Juan Carlos Molinero told a press conference. \nThe incident underscores the heightened awareness of the threat of terrorism that is becoming a part of normal life in many parts of the Europe. \nIn economic terms, the Paris attacks resulted in the region that is home to the capital reporting a 6.4 percent drop in visitor numbers from the previous year, which cost businesses 750 million euro ($790 million), according to government statistics cited by French publication The Local .
