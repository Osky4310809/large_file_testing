Speck is a well-known brand and makes cases for most flagship devices. There are two primary models for the LG G6 – the Presidio GRIP and the Presidio CLEAR. The Presidio design offers Speck’s slimmest case with superior protection. The cases use what Speck calls IMPACTIUM, which provides the case with “dynamic shock-absorbing materials,” yet introduces a 20-percent reduction in the bulk of materials. Speck lists some of its key features as 8-foot, and 10-foot drop tested, scratch-resistant finish, and a limited lifetime warranty. Each model comes with built-in, responsive buttons and the case wrap ever-so-slightly up around the edges to protect the bezel/display. Both types resist scuff marks or scratches often caused by keeping your phone in your pocket or purse where abrasive items like keys or change tend to mark up the case. \nThe names are rather self-explanatory, so let’s start with the easiest one first – the Presidio Clear. Even though it is clear, the Presidio CLEAR is still made from Speck’s IMPACTIUM CLEAR material to both absorb and resist the shock from being dropped. It is designed to resist UV rays from the sun and not turn yellow over time as well as to resist scratches and keep it as shiny as possible. It is tested using the 8-foot drop height and will cost you $44.95 with free shipping. The second model offered by Speck is the Presidio GRIP, which comes in four matte color finishes – Black/Black, Marine Blue/Twilight Blue, Graphite Grey/Charcoal Grey, and Dolphin Grey/Aloe Green for $44.95 each with free shipping. This model offers a no-slip grip surface with raised rubber ridges, and the Presidio is tested for a 10-foot drop. Both models are marked “Coming Soon” and have a place to leave your email address to be notified as soon as they are ready to order. \nWith the considerable cost of today’s smartphone, it is a smart idea to pick up a good case to keep your new LG G6 looking new for as long as you can. It will increase the resale value considerably if you spend a little extra money now for a good case and protection.
