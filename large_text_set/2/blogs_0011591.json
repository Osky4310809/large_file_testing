Hospital \nKakale added, ‘‘Over two million children were immunized in the state while the process of transforming Primary Health Care under one roof in the state has reached over ninety per cent”. \nHe said other achievements recorded in the health sector included the reactivation of quarterly free plastic surgeries at the Noma Hospital, Sokoto by foreign surgeons. \nThe commissioner disclosed that the state government provided a N100 million take off grant for the Contributory Health Scheme while more than three million people were provided free malaria drugs. \n”Health staff were recruited and posted across the state to shore up the provision of efficient healthcare services to the people. \n”Several other construction and renovation projects as well as provision of hospital equipment, drugs and medicament were executed in 2016. \n”This was not, however, without challenges like recession, delay in releases of funds, poor internal revenue generation and multiple taxation of private health facilities.” Nwafor Polycarp", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:16:01.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
