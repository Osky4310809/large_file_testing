Tonight, the regular live shows begin and the top 12 contestants perform. Check out all the different ways to vote for your favorite performers this season. \nCheck out the different ways to cast your votes and how to execute each one below. Online Voting \nClick here to vote for your favorite contestants on The Voice via the official NBC website. With this method, you can vote up to 10 times per performer and per email address. You can also vote via Facebook by clicking here . Using The Voice App to Vote \nIn order to vote using The Voice App click here to download it. The site allows you to download the app via Google Play, the Windows Phone Store and the Apple Store. During the live shows, you can start voting as soon as the show starts. And, on results nights, you can instantly SAVE your favorite contestants with a “tap-to-tweet” straight from the app. Again, the limit is 10 votes per contestant and per email address. Voting on iTunes \nYou can also vote for contestants by downloading their “eligible songs” on iTunes during the voting period. Each individual song download counts as one vote. And, if any of the artists make it into the top 10 of iTunes’ Top 200 Singles, they get a bonus, which multiplies their iTunes votes for that song times ten. \nIf you’d like to check out tons of extra info on the show as well as the voting methods, click here . \nAnd, for even more details on the rules and guidelines of The Voice voting, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-12T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-11T20:00:48.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
