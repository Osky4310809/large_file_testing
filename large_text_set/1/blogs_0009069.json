Following up her recent home video post, Kim has once again taken to Instagram, this time sharing a bunch of heart-warming photos lifted straight from the family album. \nUntil last week, Kim had assumed a dormant presence on the platform following her infamous robbery in Paris. But now, the reality star is back in the full-swing habit of doing what she does best: providing us with morsels of information and a behind-the-velvet-curtain look at life with ‘Ye. And life with ‘Ye couldn’t be much sweeter if these pics are to be believed, with one caption claiming that “[Kanye] always has my back”. Aww. \nKanye can be seen playing father to Saint and North throughout, while one candid snap shows the rapper chowing down on some soup. Sitting on a green sofa with Saint, Kanye appears to be sporting an all-white version of a sneaker from his yet-to-be-released Calabasas range, along with a grey Champion hoodie.
