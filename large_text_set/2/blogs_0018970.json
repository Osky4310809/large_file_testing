That can't be the solution. And where should he go? To be honest, and even if it might sound rude: If Gotze does not make it at Dortmund, he must go to China.\" \nGotze has again been linked with a reunion with former Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp in the English media this month, but Matthaus suggested he does not expect that to happen and said a move elsewhere in the Bundesliga is unlikely because he does not believe the player would accept a salary cut. \nHe said: \"He won't leave for Schalke, he does not fit at Leverkusen, Gladbach can't afford Gotze. Top clubs abroad no longer have him on their lists. Like I said: If he does not prevail at Dortmund, and expects similar wages elsewhere, he's off to China. But that would be pathetic for a 24-year-old.\" \nStephan Uersfeld is the Germany correspondent for ESPN FC.
