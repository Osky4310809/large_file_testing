I warned her to desist from such acts until l caught her sleeping with one of our neighbours in his room.’’ \nThe petitioner also alleged that Mary went to the village in 2011 to confess her adulterous acts. \n“Afterwards, a traditional cleansing was performed on her and l accepted to forgive her after much pleading. \n“But my wife never stopped her immoral ways. She kept conversing with the same man and flirting about. \n“On one occasion, l caught my wife signalling to my neighbour’s husband to meet her up. \n“Due to my wife’s immoral ways, business has not been going smoothly for me. \n“I became scared to have sexual intercourse with her because whenever l do, thing becomes hard for me financially. \n“She is stubborn and lacks in her responsibilities to the family.’’ \nImukoro also pleaded with court to grant him custody of their four children, urging the court to dissolve the marriage without further delay. \n“My wife, a petty trader, always spends her money on frivolous things and her concubines. She does not take proper care of the children and I am seeking immediate dissolution of our association,” he stated. \nMary, an indigene of Isoko in Delta, who pleaded guilty to the allegations, however, begged court to save her marriage amid tears. \nThe President of the court, Mr Phillips Williams, scolded the woman and advised her to change her adulterous ways. \nHe told the couple to keep the peace, pending the outcome of the court’s proceedings. \nThey were later called into the inner chamber for alternative dispute resolution of the mater. \nThe case was adjourned till Feb. 28 for possible reconciliation.
