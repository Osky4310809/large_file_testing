This chili recipe sounds delicious and will def have to try it. syako 6 years Jeli, I don't know about this recipe, but I've made a bean bake slow cooker recipe with canned beans and they sat in that thing the whole 8 hours and tasted DELICIOUS! :) So I think you should be fine. jelibeann 6 years I love the idea of using dried beans instead of canned...but if you used canned, do you put them in at the beginning or will they be overcooked? On a separate note, I'm in the middle of slow-cooking some mongolian beef right now...yum. Spectra 6 years I'm SO going to try this! I've been looking for more recipes that use my slow cooker lately. Thanks for posting this! partysugar 6 years I used chicken because it's what I had on hand. Nothing needs to be done before hand!
