Another post shows him documenting police firing plastic discs at the “Black Bloc” rioters he was among — the same demonstrators who assaulted attendees, lit off fireworks and started fires. \nBlack Bloc protesters also beat a man unconscious: \nThe anarchist group pepper sprayed an innocent girl in the face: My friend was giving an interview when some coward peppersprayed her #Berkeley pic.twitter.com/CDpEqDsw2A \nThe group also surrounded people and beat them with flagpoles: They are surrounding people and beating them with Antifa flags and poles. pic.twitter.com/v3o1kEpwFj \nSome communist protesters who were present also have connections to/are funded by billionaire leftist George Soros. (RELATED: Look Who Funds The Group Behind The Call To Arms At Milo’s Berkeley Event) \nSleuths on Twitter quickly pointed out that the person behind this @teen_archer account was likely a UC Berkeley staff member named Ian Dabney Miller. Further Daily Caller investigation has confirmed that Ian Miller, a UC Berkeley staffer, is indeed the person behind the @teen_archer account that was bragging about getting into fights with Milo attendees and participating in the riots. \nIn an interview with SF Weekly , Miller, who plays in the band “Kowloon Walled City,” talks about working at the university, saying, “I work at UC Berkeley in advancement communications. There’s really not much to say about it, frankly. It’s incredibly tedious.” It’s the same Ian Miller as the person behind the @teen_archer account, because an archive of the account @teen_archer has the name listed as “Ian Miller” and a bio that reads: \n“clawer/chugger in @kowloonwalled, @romancities, & @puigdestroyer. 1/2 of @productiveouts. music, bikes, film, baseball, veganism, radical politics. and kitties.” \nThe “Teen Archer” store also has his email address listed . Ian Miller is listed in the UC Berkeley directory , yet his email was recently removed. \nMost strikingly, he recently gave an interview to the New York Daily News, in which he identified himself as a current Berkeley employee and placed himself directly at the scene, saying , “The fuel started pouring out and they set it on fire,” and, “It got really hot.” Finally, a (now deleted) tweet from @teen_archer was embedded in the NYDN story right after his comments. \nA spokesperson for UC Berkeley told TheDC, “We are aware of the allegations involving a member of the University’s workforce. Our campus police force is currently working with the FBI in an ongoing investigation of this matter.” \nUC Berkeley gets around $400-450 million in federal funds for research and $216 million in financial aid every year, Reuters reports . \nAccording to University of California Data Analysis , Miller collected a salary from UC Berkeley for several years, making some $374,802.86 from 2008-2013. \nPresident Donald J. Trump gave his thoughts on the whole Berkeley situation last week: If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nMiller’s involvement with the protests seems to undercut the narrative that the violent riots were somehow an infiltration by secret right wingers in an otherwise peaceful protest to make the left look bad. Berkeley professor Robert Reich promoted this conspiracy theory, insinuating that Breitbart News, an outlet that Yiannopolous works for, may have been involved in the riots to smear the protesters . \nTheDC reached out to Miller over email but received no response. \n(h/t The Ralph Retort)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:47:37.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
