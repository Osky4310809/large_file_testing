However, Johnson was spotted by Paul Calvisi of Arizona Sports 98.7 FM in street clothes on the sideline with a brace on his knee, per Craig Giralou of Arizona Sports 98.7 FM. Jennifer Hale of NFL on Fox noted Johnson is able to put weight on his knee. \nAdam Schefter of ESPN reported initial tests on Johnson's knee showed damage to his meniscus, but that his ACL was intact. Schefter added Johnson will undergo an MRI on Monday for further clarity. \nAfter selecting Johnson in the third round of the 2015 NFL draft, the Cardinals slotted him third on the initial depth chart behind Andre Ellington and Chris Johnson, but strong play and an injury to Johnson moved him up to the lead position by the end of the 2015 campaign. \nJohnson kept his grasp on the starting job heading into this season and ran away with it, as he entered Week 17 with 1,233 rushing yards, 77 receptions for 841 receiving yards and 20 total touchdowns. If not for Arizona's struggles as a team, Johnson would likely be getting MVP consideration. \nEllington and Kerwynn Williams split backfield duties after Johnson was carted off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:58:08.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
