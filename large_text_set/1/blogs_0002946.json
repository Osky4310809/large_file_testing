The move extended Tuesday's roughly 2 percent drop in the peso. Dollar-peso performance \nSource: FactSet \nTrump has called for an overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement and building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. As a result, the dollar-peso was widely watched as a proxy on the election result during the presidential campaign. \nCarl Forcheski, director, corporate FX sales, America, at Societe Generale, pointed out that after a postelection spike, the dollar-peso had traded in a range in December. \nThen on Tuesday, the peso weakened after Ford Motor announced it will cancel production of a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and instead invest in Michigan. Trump had bashed the automaker for moving jobs outside the United States. Ford CEO Mark Fields said on CNBC's \" Halftime Report \" that the decision not to invest in Mexico was based on its forecast for demand. \nSeparately on Tuesday, Trump attacked General Motors with a tweet for selling a Mexican-made Chevy Cruze in the United States. GM said it makes most of its Chevy Cruze models in the U.S. and only sells a \"small number\" of one Mexican-made model in the U.S. \nThe new year moves in the peso indicate to traders that further weakness is likely ahead. \nBefore the last two days, Wizman said he expected the dollar-peso to reach 21.5, but now he estimates the currency cross could move to 22 or 23 later this year. \nForcheski at Societe Generale forecasts the dollar-peso will reach 23 in the first quarter before ending the year around 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T00:15:18.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
