But then we always predicted that would far to subtle a message for an administration that was all about glitz and glamour . And we were right. Infact, Melania didn’t even wear a dress by an American designer AT ALL. \nBut that’s not to say some serious thought hadn’t gone into her gown choice. With strong echoes of Jackie O, whose style she had channelled earlier in the day , Melania opted to design her gown, in collaboration with Herve Pierre, the former creative director of Carolina Herrera. Clever girl.

As First Lady she took the importance of image to a whole new level . \nOne example of this was designing her own inauguration gown with the help of Bergdorf’s Ethan Frankou, demonstrating her fashion prowess, and also the extent of her control over her public image.

Interestingly, red carpet designer Carolina Herrera was one of our predictions to design Melania’s gown, but this makes for a much better story. \nThe ivory off the shoulder column dress featured a swooping arc across the torso and a crimson waist ribbon. Simple and elegant with a subtle leg baring slit Melania looked undeniably stunning.

Our conversations were, and are, very easy. She knows about fashion, as a former model. She is aware about constructions, so we have already the same vocabulary when it comes to designing a dress.\" \nInterestingly Pierre, an accomplished designer in his own right, has previously hold positions at Oscar de la Renta and Vera Wang. \nIn the past this means he's worked with Hillary Clinton , when he designed for Oscar de la Renta, and also Laura Bush and Michelle Obama during his time at Carolina Herrera.
