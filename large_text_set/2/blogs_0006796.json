MPs hear the result of the vote in the House of Commons (AFP/Getty Images) \n\"I think that a Tory Brexit is going to be quite disastrous. \n”I don’t believe we’ve given a blank cheque no, we’re going to be holding them to account… on the floor of the House.\" \nThe House voted in favour of the bill by 494 to 122 - a majority of 372. \nIt will now have to pass through the House of Lords before Mrs May can invoke Article 50, which she has promised to do by April. \nThe key vote caused more problems for Labour than the Prime Minister as Jeremy Corbyn faced another revolt in his own ranks. Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit Secretary David Davis shout 'aye' (AFP/Getty Images) \nSenior frontbencher Clive Lewis sensationally resigned as shadow business secretary ahead of the vote. \nThe Norwich South MP said he handed his resignation with a “heavy heart” as he planned to vote against the Article 50 bill. \nIn a renewed wave of defiance against Mr Corbyn 52 Labour MPs voted against the bill at final reading, five more than voted against it as second reading last week. Clive Lewis quits Labour frontbench to vote against Brexit bill \nA total of 11 Labour junior shadow ministers and three whips, who are meant to enforce party discipline, voted against triggering Article 50. \nThe frontbenchers were Rosena Allin-Khan, Kevin Brennan, Lyn Brown, Ruth Cadbury, Rupa Huq, Chi Onwurah, Stephen Pound, Andy Slaughter, Catherine West, Alan Whitehead and Daniel Zeichner. \nThe whips were Thangam Debbonaire, Vicky Foxcroft and Jeff Smith.
