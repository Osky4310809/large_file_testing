The real problems started end of 2012 when the opposition and media were removed from the plenary hall by the police. After this, the remaining MPs approved the budget. This event is indicative for the state of affairs in Macedonia today. Over and over again, the opposition has been silenced, critical media have been silenced while the biggest party in the country stayed in power, till today. When there were elections (2014), the ruling coalition managed to secure its majority by allowing even the dead to vote. These unfair elections resulted in a boycott by part of the opposition. And then, there was the wiretapping scandal. In every functioning democracy, this would have resulted in the resignation of the government within 24 hours and probably early elections. In Macedonia, the parties in power pretended to be deaf and continued: business as usual. An investigation into the problems upon the request of the EU, resulted in the Pribe report and the urgent EU reform priorities. Because we all have a short memory, I repeat some of the essential elements of the Pribe report. It states that there was: Apparent direct involvement of senior government and party officials in illegal activities including: electoral fraud, abuse of power and authority, conflict of interest, blackmail, extortion (pressure on public employees to vote for a certain party with the threat to be fired), criminal damage, severe procurement procedure infringements aimed at gaining an illicit profit, nepotism and cronyism. Indications of unacceptable political interference in the nomination/appointment of judges. Interference with other supposedly independent institutions for either personal or political party advantages. And about the media — more valid than ever with the recent attacks on journalists in mind — the Pribe report stated: “Freedom of the media is an essential basis for an open, democratic society. Media should exercise their task to inform the public without any pressure or direct or indirect interference from public authorities.” Lest we forget, I advise everyone to learn this by heart, everyone, kids, grown ups, students, parents, retired people, politicians as well as all the future generations. Lest we forget. Later on, there was the Przino agreement. The aim was this agreement was to restore democracy, to hold those in power to account for their deeds and to prosecute those involved in criminal activities. It was the agreement of good intentions on behalf of three out of the four political parties involved. One party had a very short memory and continued: business as usual. As if nothing happened, and they were not to blamed for anything at all. And then, again elections (2016). The situation got worse: parliament is not meeting at all anymore, a majority of the Members of Parliament is not allowed to form a new government. And look, we all forgot what the Pribe report was about. The biggest party in Macedonia is no protesting against a platform from the Albanian parties and demands new elections, as if new elections will solve anything. Yes, of course, it will help us to forget what the crisis was really about. It will help us to forget the Pribe report, it will help us to forget how the opposition and media were kicked out of parliament on 24 December 2012. One of my friends recently told me: “We don’t want to remember what it all is really about, we don’t want to remember how democracy died in our country, we don’t want to accept that those we voted once into the government, were the wrong people. And we refuse to insist that at least the findings of the Pribe report should be checked.” Of course, those involved in illegal activities, were scared. It is the reason why they replaced judges in order to control the whole judiciary and to block the actions from the Special Prosecutor. Those ‘senior government and party officials’, they don’t care about the future of Macedonia — even though they pretend they do. Yes, citizens of Macedonia, for them, you are allowed to protest against the Albanian platform and to protect Macedonia as long as you remain silent and don’t mention even the word Pribe, as long as you forget that they killed your democracy.
