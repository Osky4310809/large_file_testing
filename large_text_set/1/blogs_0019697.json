The final instalment of the acclaimed Viking-themed series has been funded by 2,040 people for a total of $97,225.\nThe Banner Saga is fantasy RPG series which futures turn-based battles. It’s known for its writing, which allows players to make important decisions that can affect the wider story, but also its hand-drawn cel-shaded art. The upcoming title will feature more than 40 characters with unique abilities and a combat style of their own. Developer Stoic says: “It’s how they work together that counts and a well-chosen roster will equal more than the sum of its parts.”\nStoic is talking a good game, as it were, over on Kickstarter and it’s not like this is new ground for the team: the original Banner Saga was also funded on Kickstarter. I expect Stoic will deliver the goods again.\n\nThough the Banner Saga 3 initially be released on PC and Mac only, Stoic says: “We’ll still be bringing Banner Saga 3 to as many platforms as possible and backing our Kickstarter will certainly help make that process easier as well as deliver a more robust game too! This includes platforms like Mobile and Console.”\nIn other words, if you want to see this title arrive on Android like it’s predecessors, you might want to back it.\nIf you like how this one sounds, give the Kickstarter page a visit and check out The Banner Saga and The Banner Saga 2 in the Play Store at the links.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T12:00:35.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
