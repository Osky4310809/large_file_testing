That’s a marked drop from a 3.5% growth rate in the third quarter and below the 2.2% MarketWatch-compiled consensus. \nIn early trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.04% was little changed. The Dow finished at a record high Thursday, however, and is now up 25% over the last 52 weeks. \nFor the full year, the U.S. grew just 1.6%, compared with its 2.6% clip in 2015.

Yet economists say it will take time before the U.S. reaps any benefits. \nMost predict the economy will grow around 2% or a bit faster in 2017. If Trump’s approach works, the payoff is unlikely to come until the end of the year or early 2018, they say. \nTrump’s approach will work. \nHe’s a businessman. He knows how to get the job done. \nSoon, we’ll be at 3%-plus!
