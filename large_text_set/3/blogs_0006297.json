My favorite: Marie Curie, who was world renowned for her expertly applied smoky eye pic.twitter.com/YSncV0aCSC — Avery Hartmans (@averyhartmans) March 8, 2017 \nSnapchat made two more filters to honor the day — one for Rosa Parks and another for Frida Kahlo — which celebrated what both women were known for. While Curie's filter has a cute animation where a test tube blows up and temporarily covers the user's face in soot, it quickly disappears and leaves behind a full face of makeup. \nSeveral women took to Twitter to express their displeasure that Curie's filter seems to focus on making the user prettier.
