By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 12, 2017 11:36 AM Nitish Kumar decided not to contest in Uttar Pradesh because of party’s limited presence, (Source: PTI) \nMany political leaders in the past had differences within the same alliance after failing to win an election but in a first, all is not looking good in RJD-JD(U) alliance as national vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of ‘only helping BJP by not contesting UP polls’. this statement came on Saturday after BJP under the leadership of Amit Shah pulled off a historic win in UP. However, the former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi advised Nitish to come back to NDA and save himself from regular embarrassment at the hands of the RJD. \n“Though the BJP won UP because of many factors, Nitish Kumar not contesting the polls in UP after preparing for over two years is as good as helping the BJP,” said Singh in response to Uttar Pradesh elections. Singh has a history of attacking Nitish Kumar has once again started the debate about Nitish Kumar’s proximity to BJP as he said that Janata Dal (United) had supported the BJP over demonetisation as against the stand of the Grand Alliance partners — the RJD and the Congress . \nYou may also want to watch: \n“It is time for Nitish Kumar to recalibrate his politics. He should come back to the NDA fold to escape regular embarrassment at the hands of the RJD. It is time Nitish Kumar sheds his differences with the BJP and returns to the NDA,” said Manjhi who believes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has changed the political scene in the country. \nDefending Nitish Kumar and JD (U), party principal general secretary and national spokesperson K C Tyagi told the Indian Express that party had no plans to contest in UP due to its limited presence in the state. “We are at least happy that RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has acknowledged Nitish Kumar’s big stature, albeit by way of criticism. We have little presence in UP. We did not contest UP polls because we did not find a place in SP-Congress alliance,” Tyagi said.
