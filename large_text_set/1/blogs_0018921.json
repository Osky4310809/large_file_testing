Duma lyrically underpins its upbeat pulse with a bittersweet realization, acknowledging the futility of trying to change someone's mind. \n\"'All The Air' is about the realization that no matter how hard you try, you can never force someone to appreciate your worth,\" she said. \"I want people to feel good and dance while dismissing those who have wasted their time. I think it's all very empowering.\" \nListen to the song below and look for Duma's debut EP later this spring. \nCorinne Przybyslawski is on Twitter .
