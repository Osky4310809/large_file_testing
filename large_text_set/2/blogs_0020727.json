The two promoted a handful of puppies by weaving elaborate lies about them. “Because if you’re not willing to lie for an adorable puppy, then you belong in a shelter,” Colbert joked. Celebrities Obsessed With Their Cats \nThe adoptable dogs included Slugger, a Lab mix who, according to Colbert, is “certified in shiatsu massage and is trained to poop only on the lawns of your enemies. Also, Slugger always remembers your mother’s birthday and will remind you ahead of time to send her a card.” 'Keeping Up With the Kattarshians' Is the Cat-Centric Reality Show You Never Knew You Needed And then there was Ace, a hound mix who “can talk but chooses not to as a form of protest against wage inequality.
