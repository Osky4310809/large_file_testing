To embellish the space, Bari worked with Italian artist Andrea Facelli, better known as FACE , who plastered the interior with newspaper clippings, and created a range of bespoke statues, which were heavily inspired by religious themes.\nBari‚Äôs work alongside Facelli is also set to continue with a new project in Los Angeles, and while details are still forthcoming, we sat down with Andrea to speak about his with with VLONE so far, and to find out more about the themes in his work.\nCheck out Highsnobiety ‚Äòs exclusive interview with FACE below.\nFACE - 'A Me Gli Occhi' (2017) My friend Gabrielle from Slam Jam helped me get in touch with Bari, who needed some religious icons for the VLONE store in Milan.\nWe started looking through some of the art on my Instagram for inspiration, and Bari liked the skateboard with a melted Jesus in red cardinal wax. We thought it could be good to recreate this in the form of a statue in the pop-up shop. He chose orange for the wax, and I asked my sculpture guy to do a massive six-foot statue in marble, which weighed about 300 kg.\n(A) 2015 For serious inquiries and info,please write meüì©andreafacelli@gmail.com #facegraphicsarchive #panicroom #vlone #slamjam #asaprocky#markers #ink #sketch #sketchaday #illustration #graphicdesign #graphic #artcompetition #artoftheday #artshow #artfair #artgallery #artstudio #fineart #instaart #instaartwork #instaartist #instaartoftheday #oilpaintings #originalartwork #modernart #mixedmediaart #portrait \nA post shared by Intl Aesthetic Terrorist¬Æ (@faccia13) on Sep 20, 2016 at 3:41am PDT \n\nThe other statue is a black virgin painted with anthrax paint and gold highlights. It wears a barbed wire halo, and we added some rose petals on the floor to make it more sacred, and to add this religious aspect, like something romantic.\nBlack Virgin 2014 For serious inquiries and info,please write meüì©andreafacelli@gmail.com #facegraphicsarchive #panicroom #blackvirgin #blackandwhite #drawing #markers #ink #sketch #photography #illustration #graphicdesign #graphic #artcompetition #artoftheday #artshow #artfair #artgallery #artstudio #fineart #instaart #instaartwork #instaartist #instaartoftheday #oilpaintings #originalartwork #modernart #mixedmediaart #portrait \nA post shared by Intl Aesthetic Terrorist¬Æ (@faccia13) on Jan 20, 2017 at 10:16pm PST \n\nThe red Madonna, it‚Äôs actually funny that you‚Äôre asking me, a lot of people think it‚Äôs red, but it‚Äôs orange like the fruit, and was also made with sealing wax. We melted around 40 kg in a boiling pan, then used a big spoon and drizzled the wax over the top until the statue was covered, and all the other details are painted with brushes of different sizes.\nA lot of people see the black virgin as satanic or evil. But for me, the black virgin represents the beginning, 2,000 years ago, she was pure and made of gold, but after so many years of sins, crimes, murder and evil done by people, Madonna was covered inside a volcano and turned black.\nAs you see, only the eyes, halo and the roses still remain gold. All the Madonnas have different positions, because they are from different places, like Lourdes, Medjugorje, and Loretto, and each Madonna has a different pose with her hands. The meaning of covering Madonna with sealing wax refers to the vision of protecting humans until there will be a resurrection or an apocalypse, Madonna will be powerful.\nMy aesthetic and view of graphic design comes from when I was a skater. I‚Äôve always been fascinated with skateboard decks, magazines and T-shirts, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm very detail oriented with my art, especially with collages, where I use antique books and vintage magazines to create sinister and spooky moods.\nRegarding the collage artworks, I enjoy being patient and putting in the time to cut and clip parts. I like to listen to the clock moving, sometimes silence is even better than music.\nFACE - 'Untitled' (2017) I spent 13 years as a chef in a Michelin-star restaurant. I have to thank the other chefs there and the kitchen staff, because they taught me how to work with tools and different instruments. I also learned a militaristic work ethic in the kitchen; everything had to be done in the right way, with a certain method.\nIt‚Äôs a lot like a formula, repeating the same things with the same ingredients, eventually you can perfectly do these jobs. If you apply this to any work, it‚Äôs one of the best methods.\nI thought it was the sickest Air Force 1 collaboration. The black and orange match very well, and I like the details, it‚Äôs a bit more special than other Air Force 1s. There should be some clothing too between VLONE and Nike, hopefully soon.\nI think Bari makes a philosophical statement with the phrase ‚ÄúEvery Living Creative Dies Alone,‚Äù it says a lot about contemporary style and fashion. It can be taken as a bit of a joke, but it‚Äôs still something serious.\nSorry, I can‚Äôt say much, but I can say it‚Äôs about skateboard decks, so stay tuned!\nI don‚Äôt like talking or thinking too much about the future, or about the past, because tomorrow and yesterday are two days that no one can change. I like to live my life in the present, one day in a life can be seen as an entire life; in the morning as a child, in the afternoon growing up, until the end of the night, dying and rising again the next day. If you‚Äôre happy everyday living this routine, I think your life can always be better and try to reach the best for you.\nNow check out our conversation with A$AP Rocky and A$AP Bari, as they explain the concepts behind VLONE for Highsnobiety Magazine Issue 13 \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:33:24.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
