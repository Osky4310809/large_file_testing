Stethoscope (Photo: Thinkstock Images) \nOn Nov. 4, 1971, Shep Glazer, a New Yorker on renal dialysis, treated the House Ways and Means Committee to a grim five-minute show-and-tell . It was the first and probably last time an artificial kidney machine appeared on Capitol Hill. \nNearly a year to the day later, President Richard M. Nixon signed a Social Security bill that included a curious provision to help Glazer and others like him: Anyone with chronic renal disease , or who would require a kidney transplant, automatically qualified for Medicare regardless of age, according to the bill the Republican president received from the Democrat-controlled 92nd Congress. \n“I am highly gratified to be able, at long last, to put my signature on H.R. 1 — thus lifting these long-sought benefits out of debate and placing them into the laws of our generous and compassionate land,” Nixon wrote in signing Public Law 92-602 on Oct. 20, 1972. \nTwo years later, Nixon resigned. A decade after that, almost to the day Nixon left Washington in disgrace, I woke up in a hospital in San Antonio thanking him. \nI was 24 years old at the time and enrolled in Medicare, the government health care program usually available only to Americans 65 years and older. But because of Nixon, my transplant and my six weeks of dialysis before my brother gave me his kidney cost me nothing. The entire multi-thousand-dollar bill for my thrice-weekly dialysis treatments and the transplant surgery for my brother and me was financed by the federal aid along with the then-Texas Kidney Health Fund and health insurance from my then-employer, Rupert Murdoch. As soon as I no longer needed dialysis, I was promptly dropped from Medicare and returned to a dog-eat-dog health insurance market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-13T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-13T17:09:23.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
