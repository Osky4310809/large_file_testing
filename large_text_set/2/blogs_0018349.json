So when he was asked if Trapped was in a way synonymous of him being trapped as the poster boy of Indie cinema, Raj Kummar said, “I didn’t think about it in that way. I don’t think that I am the poster boy of Indie cinema. For me every film is important, but the script is the most important part.” \n# Raj suffered blackouts during Trapped \nPost the trailer launch, director Vikramaditya Motwane revealed how Raj Kummar Rao shot for the film. He mentioned that they shot for 20 straight days in a linear format. During this period, Raj did not eat anything except carrots and black coffee coz the actor wanted to look convincing on screen that he was actually trapped inside a house without any basic necessities to help him survive. Few days he even stopped eating and this caused him a lot of problems. As Raj Kummar revealed, “It was really taxing. In fact, I used to have black outs sometimes. Not having food for two days was taxing. But Trapped was a great experience as an actor.” \n# Comment on the Malayalam actress molestation case \nRecently a shocking news broke out that a Malayalam actress was molested. This had created a lot of controversy over the past few days, with various celebrities coming out and speaking against it. When Raj Kummar Rao was asked about it, the actor mentioned, “I don’t know what happened. I have just come back from Berlin. I have no clue about it.

From that time I was telling him, ‘Sir, I want to work with you coz you are one of the best we have.’ I met him for Lootera too and he told me that it was Ranveer who had bagged the part. So I was like, ‘Now in the third film, you will want another person with the letter R.’ So it was the best opportunity and we met at one of the screening and he told me about this movie. That’s how I came on board.” \n# He was scared of the tall buildings in Mumbai \nRaj Kummar Rao was perfect for Trapped because he felt similar emotion when he saw flats in the tall buildings of Mumbai for the first time. As he revealed during the press conference, “When I came to Bombay first,, so we had bungalows in Delhi, so when I saw the huge building and flats with grills, I was scared. The first thought that came into my mind was I am trapped. God forbid, if some day a fire breaks out, then where will I go? So that way people will react to this film.” Published: February 22, 2017 10:10 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:21:50.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
