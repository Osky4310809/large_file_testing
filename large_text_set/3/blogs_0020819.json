contradicting Mr Trump's Twitter accusations. \nTestifying under oath he said that his agency was conducting an investigation into possible Trump administration ties to Russia . \nAs a result, Mr Brinkley, who also teaches history at a private research university in Texas , said: “There’s a smell of treason in the air.” \nHe added: “Imagine if J Edgar Hoover or any other FBI director would have testified against a sitting president? It would have been a mind-boggling event.” \nMr Trump's approval ratings are far worse than those of any former president at this point in their presidency. According to Gallup's tracking polls , Mr Trump had an approval rating of 39 per cent during polling conducted between 13 and 19 March. \nOther presidents had far higher approval figures at the same time during their first year in office: Barack Obama had a 62 per cent approval rating, George W Bush had a 58 per cent approval rating and Bill Clinton had the previous lowest rating at 53 per cent.

His supporters were amiable by and large. But then he can never let go and stop watching cable TV. Now he's off to the worst start of a presidency in a very long time.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-22T13:44:11.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
