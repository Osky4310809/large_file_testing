It’s time to start worrying about the real victims! \nThe House of Commons has passed M-103, a non-binding motion condemning Islamophobia and religious discrimination. \nAll NDP and nearly all Liberal MPs supported the motion, which passed 201-91… \nThe vote follows months of bitter debate and a series of protests and counter-protests across the country over whether the private member’s motion would limit free speech or single out Islam for special treatment in Canadian law. \nCan speech really be considered “free” if it hurts a Muslim’s feelings? There oughtta be a law! And in Canada, it’s only a matter of time before there is one. \nAny speech that someone else hates is, by definition, hate speech. And hate speech is bad.
