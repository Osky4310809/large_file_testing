The Kat Von D Saint + Sinner Palette reveal we've been waiting for since November is finally here . Steffanie Strazzere from the Kat Von D Artistry Collective took over the cruelty-free company's account for the day and showed off the cover and inside of the palette. (She also posted tons of pictures of Von D's precious hairless Sphinx cats and some teasers for an upcoming YouTube video.) In case you forgot during all the waiting, Von D gave a behind-the-scenes look at the shade name selection process on her personal Instagram a few months ago. In the caption, she explained that the eye shadows were \"inspired by a stained glass window I saw in a cathedral.\" Well, the hues aren't the only thing that took cues from it. The cover looks just like the doors of a cathedral. The black palette is embellished with metallic golden filigree that simultaneously looks like Kat Von D's signature gothic style and medieval architecture. Imagine Notre Dame in eye shadow palette form, and Von D made it happen. The Alchemist Holographic Palette is work of art in and of itself, but Von D outdid herself with the Saint + Sinner Palette. The intricate details are incredible.

On the left side, you'll find angelic whites, soft pinks, and creamy purples. They are considered part of the \"saint\" color story. The \"sinner\" side, on the other hand, is made up of bold cobalt, neon green, electric orange, and other vibrant shades. If wearing bold eye makeup is wrong, KVD sure made it look so right.
