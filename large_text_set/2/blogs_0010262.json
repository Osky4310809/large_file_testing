In his tweet, Blass referred to a smartphone that may be in the works with the model number SM-N950. Because the Note series has so far used the name scheme N9xx this is the first tangible indication we have seen that Samsung will not only be sticking with the Note series , but that it will release a Galaxy Note 8 this year. Samsung Galaxy S8 models are indeed skipping SM-G94* model numbers, will ship as SM-G950 & SM-G955. Know what else is in the works? SM-N950. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) 9.

This would allow Samsung quite a lot of time to ensure that their new model does not come with the same faults as the Galaxy Note 7. \nAs the Note 8 is currently being developed, the manufacturer had to choose a code name. Thanks to a Twitter account which has recently been publishing a lot of information about Samsung, we now know what its code name actually is. The mysterious Twitter account's author is also active on Weibo, so it would appear that this is a Chinese source. The Note 8 iscode named \"Baikal\", which refers to the Siberian Lake that is considered as the largest freshwater reserve on Earth.
