Under the hood, there’s the same HR12DE 1.2 litre three-cylinder engine found in the March hatchback and Almera sedan . The mill outputs 79 PS and 106 Nm of torque, with drive being directed to the front wheels via an Xtronic CVT only (no manual option). \nAccording to Nissan, the Note’s fuel consumption is rated at 5 l/100 km, whereas CO2 emissions is at 120 g/km, both well within Phase 1 specifications. As previously reported, the JDM Note e-Power and its range extender hybrid powertrain is given a miss for the Thailand market. \nIn terms of design, the Note is based on the latest facelifted model that made its debut in Japan back in November 2016. Visual changes include a more prominent V-motion grille, new projector headlamps, redesigned bumpers front and back, while the interior features a new three-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel. \nEquipment-wise, the Note gets automatic air-conditioning, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system (VL only), 5-inch audio system (V only) steering wheel controls (VL only), keyless operation, Fine Vision Meter and fabric upholstery. \nAs for safety and driver assistance systems, the Note comes with dual front airbags, Vehicle Dynamic Control, ABS with EBD, brake assist and hill start assist as standard across the range. However, only the VL gets fancier tech such as Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Nissan Intelligent Emergency Braking, Forward Emergency Braking (with pedestrian recognition), Lane Departure Warning, Around View Monitor and Moving Object Detection. \nThe Note is aimed squarely at the Honda Jazz, which has a higher price range of between 594,000 (RM74,993) and 754,000 baht (RM95,220) in Thailand. The reason for the difference is because the Jazz isn’t listed as an eco car in Thailand due to its larger 1.5 litre engine (Phase 1 spec is below 1,200 cc), and thus, loses out on pricing incentives. \nInterested? Well, it’s not likely that the Note will be introduced to Malaysia soon, despite despite official previews and local sightings of the pre-facelift model in the past. However, if it did arrive, would you pick the Note over the Jazz? Let us know in the comments below.
