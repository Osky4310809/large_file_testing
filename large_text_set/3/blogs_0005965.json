He contacted the Marine Corps on Jan. 30 after discovering the pictures — and more than 2,500 comments that accompanied them. Less than a day later, the accounts responsible for sharing the sexually explicit images were deleted and the page was gone, CIR reported.\nThe Marines who shared the photos are said the be stationed at bases across the globe, from Japan to North Carolina. Many of them targeted Brennan on Facebook after he ousted the Marines United page.\n“Waterboard this p-o-s,” wrote one user. “I’ll pay 500 to the dude that can get good nudes of his girl.”\nIt’s unclear how many Marines are being probed over the Facebook page.\nIf proven to have posted an explicit photo of another person, an enlisted service member could be charged with violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, according to CIR.\nA Marine who directly participates in, encourages or condones these actions may also face charges or adverse administrative actions.\nTop brass in the Marine Corps condemned the soldier’s actions on Sunday, saying there was no place for it in the service.\n“There is no place for this type of demeaning or degrading behavior in our Corps,” Sergeant Major Ronald L. Green, 18th Sergeant Major, told CBS News .\n“Let me be perfectly clear; no person should be treated this way,” he said. “It is inconsistent with our Core Values, and it impedes our ability to perform our mission.”\nWith Post Wires \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-06T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-06T05:42:19.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
