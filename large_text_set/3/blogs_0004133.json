That operation was supervised by one of the Maute groups,” he added. \nDela Rosa said that based on the interrogation of Alonto, a member of the terror group was in MSU when he spoke at the school’s commencement exercises. \nThe PNP chief obtained a degree in public administration from MSU in 1982 then went to the Philippine Military Academy. \nHeavily guarded \n“Why wasn’t (the assassin) able to penetrate (the security cordon)? You can see I’m heavily guarded. There are also many Maranaos who love me. Aside from my personal security, the MSU community also helped secure us,” Dela Rosa said. \nHe said he had yet to beef up his security despite the assassination attempt. \n“I’m sure my men are capable. My security are capable of protecting me and I can protect myself and I know the Lord will not abandon me. God is always with me wherever I go,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T02:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:29:36.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
