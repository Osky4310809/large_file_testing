Jason Chaffetz on Tuesday warned some Americans that their healthcare choice may come down to buying a new iPhone or paying for medical coverage.\n“You know what, Americans have choices. And they’ve got to make a choice,” Chaffetz (R-Utah) said on CNN .\n“And so maybe, rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest in their own healthcare – they’ve got to make those decision themselves,”\nChaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on CNN, a day after the House released a long-awaited plan to replace ObamaCare.\nHe said the GOP version eliminates the individual mandate that requires people to sign up for healthcare coverage or pay a penalty.\nInstead, the GOP is proposing individual tax credits to help them purchase insurance.\n“We’re getting rid of the individual mandate. We’re getting rid of those things that people said they don’t want,” he said.\n  LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-07T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-07T17:21:11.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
