(Photo: Getty Images) More Jennifer Aniston wore a shimmering black Atelier Versace gown with a plunging neckline and a high slit at the 89th Annual Academy Awards . She accessorized with dazzling Lorraine Schwartz diamonds, including earrings with 100 carats of diamonds — worth $9.5 million — and a 20-carat diamond ring — worth $1.2 million. While many viewers took to social media to praise the 48-year-old actress’s look, one had a surprising take. Kathy Hilton, the famous mother of socialites Nicky and Paris , tweeted, “Jennifer Aniston looks so beautiful tonight. I am telling you she is having a baby girl. 100/ percent!” \n— Kate Casey (@KateCasey) February 27, 2017 Hilton has since deleted the tweet, but not before replying “no” to a user who asked if she meant Natalie Portman — not Aniston — in the tweet. Aniston has not made any recent public statements regarding her future plans to have or not have a child, but she did pen a powerful letter regarding the subject in the Huffington Post in July of 2016. In the piece, she slammed reports in the press that she was in fact pregnant and detailed the emotional abuse that is attached to tabloid reporting. “I resent being made to feel ‘less than’ because my body is changing and/or I had a burger for lunch and was photographed from a weird angle and therefore deemed one of two things: ‘pregnant’ or ‘fat,'” she wrote. “Not to mention the painful awkwardness that comes with being congratulated by friends, coworkers and strangers alike on one’s fictional pregnancy (often a dozen times in a single day).” She also acknowledged that she is often the subject of tabloid reporting — relating to whether or not she is with child. “This past month in particular has illuminated for me how much we define a woman’s value based on her marital and maternal status,” she wrote. “The sheer amount of resources being spent right now by press trying to simply uncover whether or not I am pregnant (for the bajillionth time… but who’s counting) points to the perpetuation of this notion that women are somehow incomplete, unsuccessful, or unhappy if they’re not married with children.” Aniston believes that one’s life can be entirely fulfilled, whether or not one chooses to find a partner or have children. “Here’s where I come out on this topic: we are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone.” In the note she also stated that if she was to get pregnant, she wouldn’t hide it. “Yes, I may become a mother some day, and since I’m laying it all out there, if I ever do, I will be the first to let you know,” she wrote. “But I’m not in pursuit of motherhood because I feel incomplete in some way, as our celebrity news culture would lead us all to believe.” Read More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T02:15:18.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
