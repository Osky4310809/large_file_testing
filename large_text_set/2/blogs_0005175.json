Amazon had a flash sale for the version with 3 GB of RAM on February 2, which quickly sold out. Today, the retailer had another flash sale, but this time the slightly more powerful variant of the device with 4 GB of RAM was surprisingly also available for purchase.\nIf you’ve missed it, don’t worry. The next flash sale is scheduled for February 16, when you’ll again be able to get your hands on both versions of the device. The Honor 6X with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage will set you back Rs. 12,999, while the version with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of space can be yours for Rs. 15,999. Just be sure to register now so you don’t miss out again.\nSee also: Honor 6X review January 3, 2017 As a refresher, the Honor 6X sports a 5.5-inch 1080p display and is powered by the Kirin 655 chipset. It features a rear-facing dual-camera setup with 12 and 2 MP sensors as well as a metal body. You’ll find a fingerprint sensor on the back of the device and an 8 MP selfie snapper on the front.\nOther features worth mentioning are a 3,340 mAh battery, expandable storage (up to 256 GB), and Android Marshmallow with Huawei’s custom EMUI on top. However, the device will get bumped up to Android 7.0 Nougat within the first half of the year .\nIf you’re interested in getting the device, make sure you register for the next flash sale.
