The age of the revival is upon us, and beloved television shows continue to be resurrected by networks and online platforms in search of surefire hits. The latest series to come back from cancellation is Living Single , the popular Fox comedy about six friends living in Brooklyn that starred Queen Latifah and featured appearances by everyone from Eartha Kitt to a young Terrence Howard. The show was a ’90s milestone that set the stage for countless other shows about 20-something pals making their way through life in the big city. \nThough Queen Latifah had been in contact with members of the original cast about reprising their roles, the revival might have remained under wraps if it weren’t for a dedicated fan: a caller to Watch What Happens Live asked if there was a chance at a Living Single reboot, only to have Latifah tell them the project was already in the works. The enthusiasm with which the news was received by the caller, host Andy Cohen, and even the show’s other guest, Jason Sudeikis, speaks to the universality of Living Single ’s basic premise. Their names might not be as well known as Monica Geller, Rachel Green, and Phoebe Buffay, but the adventures of Khadijah James, Regine Hunter, Maxine Shaw and Synclaire James were every bit as engrossing. \nTwenty years can change a lot of things, but stories about women’s lives—balancing relationships, careers, and personal dreams—are always in demand. There are myriad issues that a new Living Single could address: Did Khadijah’s Flavor magazine go digital? Has Regine channeled her fashion knowledge into a career in styling? Is acid-tongued lawyer Maxine still pushing Kyle’s buttons all these years later? Only time will tell what the Queen and her production company come up with—but a fresh opportunity to share stories about dynamic female characters is always welcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-14T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-14T04:52:12.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
