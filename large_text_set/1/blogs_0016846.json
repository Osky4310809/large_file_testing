Samsung TouchWiz \nTouchWiz is so common that many think it is the stock version of Android. It is known for it's blue, white and gray color palette. Sony Xperia UI \nWith no physical home button, Sony's interface has buttons built into the UI on the bottom of the screen. HTC Sense \nSense's flat, Material Design is moving closer to stock Android, but the dark grey app drawer makes it distinct. LG UX \nThe LG UX comes with no app drawer, some oddly colored wallpapers and flat, square icons. Huawei / Honor Emotion UI \nEMUI has no app drawer as well, and resembles iOS strongly. Stock Android \nStock Android is purely Google-made, so the devices which run it receive software updates first, naturally. This is the real deal. \nFor more information and a detailed comparison of each UI listed here, check out our article on the subject. Which unique aspects from different OEM's UIs do you wish Google would add to stock Android? Do you prefer TouchWiz over stock?
