Ayodele Fayose \n“Some people have been making overtures to me to join the APC, but I cannot join them. With what have they repaid somebody like Asiwaju Tinubu? He worked and helped the party to secure victory but has been dumped. That is not a party I would be interested in joining. \n“One thing I would not allow is for anybody to rubbish our leaders in the South-West. Our leaders, including Asiwaju Tinubu must be accorded their due respect, as any attempt to rubbish them will be taken as a slap on the entire Yoruba race,” he added. \nThe clarification by the governor came on the heels of crisis rocking the PDP at the national level in which Senators Ahmed Makarfi and Ali Modu Sheriff are locked in battle over the national chairmanship seat of the party. \nThis is just as the governor said his administration would complete the rehabilitation of the federal Ado-Itawure Road before the burial of the late Military Governor of the old Western Region, Major-General Adeyinka Adebayo. \nHe also promised to rehabilitate the Ifaki-Omuo Road, another federal road, to make access to the state more pleasurable.
