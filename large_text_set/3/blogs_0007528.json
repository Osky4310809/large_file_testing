It was fun and I loved it until it wasn’t,” Eliza added. “Drugs didn’t love me, they didn’t love my family. They definitely didn’t love my friends that died, I have a lot of friends that are dead.”\nWatch the rest of the powerful speech in the video below.\n\nEliza Dushku addresses students at NH Youth Summit on Opioid Awareness ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-08T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-08T03:01:51.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
