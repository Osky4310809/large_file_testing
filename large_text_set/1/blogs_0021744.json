Meaning, a young, charismatic minority – either male or female. \n(Insert racist Republican joke here). \nProgressive New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, thankfully, says he’s not thinking about a run for president in 2020. \nSo, he’ll probably run. \nFrom Daily Caller : \nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said on Saturday that he will not run for president in 2020. \n“Four years will be here in a blink. Are you going to run for president?” CNN’s Brooke Baldwin asked Booker during an interview at the Women’s March in Washington, D.C. \n“No,” Booker said emphatically, “and I think we make a mistake…if we’re focused on four years from now.” \n“I will definitely be one of many in this country lifting our voice stepping out to fight, but we weaken ourselves if we think that this is about 2020.” \n… \n“So right now, I don’t care about 2020; I don’t care about 2018.” \nOkay, Cory. You’re on the record. \nYou’re out. \nYou won’t want to look like a hypocrite, now will you?
