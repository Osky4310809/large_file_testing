Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nUnless you’re a fan of BBC West Midlands’ Inside Out show, you will have missed a revealing interview on Monday night. \nIt was between Jeff Astle ’s daughter, Dawn, and Professional Footballers Association chairman Gordon Taylor. And although it was about the link between heading balls and dementia, it highlighted why many of English football’s worst excesses carry on unchallenged. \nFormer West Brom striker Astle died in 2002, aged 59, from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had repeated blows to the head. \nHe was the first footballer to have a coroner rule he died from an “industrial illness.” Science is becoming more concerned with how heading footballs affects the brain (Photo: Getty) \nDawn met Taylor in his PFA office on the day after the 15th anniversary of her dad’s death — an anniversary Taylor was oblivious to, as he inquired “When did Jeff die?” \nGreat start. \nWhen Dawn asked if he thought there was a link between former players heading heavy leather balls and dementia, Taylor blew hard, grimaced, then after five seconds said the disease may be linked to boxers but he wasn’t sure about footballers “because I can give you as many former players who’ve had problems with knees, hips and ankles.” Astle is a legend at West Brom, who have gates at their ground named after him (Photo: Action Images) Read More Heading a football during routine practice 'significantly' changes brain function, research finds \nDawn told him his union has a duty of care to its former members, only for Taylor (who sanctioned the PFA’s £6million purchases of LS Lowry paintings) to reply “We’ve got a fraction of the resources of the Premier League, Football League, FA and FIFA. Now I’m not passing a buck...” \nShe became increasingly agitated, telling him: “Because it is one of your former members who’s died of boxer’s brain, you should be screaming from the rooftops for these players,” before throwing down her mic and storming off in tears, leaving Taylor looking like a rabbit lost in headlights. Dawn Astle (middle) sat down with Gordon Taylor in the programme... (Photo: BBC) ...but his answers on her father's death and brain issues among ex-footballers... (Photo: BBC) ...were so frustrating, she cut the conversation short and stormed out (Photo: BBC) Read More At least 300 football heroes diagnosed with Alzheimer's amid headers warnings \nOutside, after two hours of obfuscation, excuses and no answers from the leader of her father’s old union, she said: “I feel bitterly, bitterly let down.” \nAndy Gray told the programme — which is available via the BBC iPlayer — that the way the Astle family has been treated by the PFA is “nothing short of scandalous.” \nHe’s not alone. \nIan St John implored the PFA to commission research into the link, after four of his old Liverpool team-mates were struck by dementia, caused in his opinion by repeatedly heading water-soaked leather footballs. Liverpool hero St John didn't get far asking the PFA to look into footballers' dementia (Photo: Liverpool Echo) Read More As evidence of dementia link to football emerges, is it time to stop kids doing headers? \nBut he was told by his union there was nothing they could do because “women of our age suffer from dementia.” \nDawn, whose Jeff Astle Foundation has been approached by around 300 families of ex-players, calls Taylor an “absolute disgrace” saying “he’s the head of an organisation that’s whole existence is player welfare yet he can’t answer the simple question ‘Do we have a problem with former players and dementia?’” \nSadly, the highest-paid trade union official in the world, who’s been in the post for 37 years, rarely gives a satisfying answer. Astle died, aged just 59, from a disease connected to having repeated blows to the head (Photo: Express/Getty Images) Read More England World Cup winner and Manchester United legend to donate their brains to medical science \nImagine any other union leader saying there may be an epidemic of workplace injuries affecting our members but we can’t fight it because multi-national companies have more resources? \nWhen Gary Johnson tried to contact the PFA with claims he’d been abused by Chelsea scout Eddie Heath, he claims they didn’t return his calls. \nThey say they did. But they failed to take up his case or find out if other ex-players had suffered from abuse which turned out to be widespread. \nWith the PFA, it always seems to be, “don’t kick up a fuss, no good will come of it”. Johnson says the PFA didn't call back when he made allegations of abuse - they say they did (Photo: Adam Gerrard/Daily Mirror) Read More Twenty-five footballers come forward after new study links heading to degenerative disease dementia \nWhen fans ask Taylor to urge his members to curb their wage demands and help the campaign for affordable ticket prices they are met with silence. \nWhen there are calls for more of the TV billions to be poured into the grass roots, there’s not a peep. \nBut maybe when your union gets £22m from those deals, enabling Taylor in 2014 to bag a pay package worth £3,368,653, why stick your head above the parapet? \nDawn Astle’s conclusion on Taylor was: “If he’s not got the will he should stand down and let someone else fight for what’s important.” \nThat’s one of the most popular cries in football. \nBut sadly it keeps going unheard.
