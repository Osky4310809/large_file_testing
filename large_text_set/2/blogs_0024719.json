You’re a seeker of truth, passion and adventure, but you also like to create a healthy environment with your partner, and build a solid future together. You can’t stand a partner who’s dismissive or distracted from your common goal and you prefer to save your precious energy for someone who shares the same values with you.\nTaurus (April 20 – May 20) \nYou demand great loyalty and solid morals from a partner, and someone who forgets these are your core values will make you stone cold sooner or later. You take a lot of time to open up to people and put great effort into allowing someone space in your heart. When a lover lies, cheats or breaks a promise, you shun them and never look back.\nGemini (May 21 – June 20) \nYou like a partner on the same wavelength as you, Gemini, and when someone doesn’t vibrate or resonate to your life goals or beliefs, you find it difficult to work through the relationship. You fight hard for love, but once you sense you and your date are not fighting the same battlefield, you’d rather leave than show a white flag.\nCancer (June 21 – July 22) \nYou hate not feeling loved. You invest great time and emotion in your relationships and demand a partner to be as involved as you are in your shared life. You grow weary of a lover who neglects your emotional needs or who spends too much time away from you. Physical attraction is also highly important for you, so you might bail out sooner or later when you stop finding a partner as desirable as they used to be.\nLeo (July 23 – August 22) \nYou’re both passionate and a nurturer, but when your partner gets to have the upper hand on most aspects of your relationship, you literally feel like a lion caged by a rabbit. You thrive to manifest your seductiveness and leadership in love and you simply won’t tolerate not having these needs met. You run with scissors when someone tries to wash away your fire.\nVirgo (August 23 – September 22) \nYou like being in control of what lies ahead of you, Virgo, and you have a hard time navigating foreign or muddy waters without a compass. You enjoy stability, and knowing your partner will always be there for you, no matter how life or the two of you may change. You find it challenging to adapt to a partner who moves at a faster pace and you grow resentful of those who don’t honour your personal set of values and beliefs. You want a partner who dances the same dance as you do, and hate to feel out of sync with your date.\nLibra (September 23 – October 22) \nYou’re terrified of boredom and often flee from a relationship before the lights are up, Libra. You want things passionate and exciting each day, and you demand creativity and lust from your partner. In the same time, you can’t stand a dull life and you’re not afraid to cut your losses when a relationship becomes too comfortable or too “safe”. You want someone who always keeps you interested and won’t settle for anything else than consuming love.\nScorpio (October 23 – November 21) \nYou always leave a lover who betrays you or no longer pays the same amount of attention to your emotions. You like your relationships without secrets, games or afflictions, and you simply can’t bear a partner who hides something from you, lies to you or forgets about your feelings.\nSagittarius (November 22 – December 21) \nYou’re an adventurer and your heart’s often a lonely hunter. Your motto in life (and in love) is “no borders”, and when a relationship becomes too comfortable, your spirit grows restless. You like to travel, explore your sexuality and unleash the most creative aspects of your psyche, and you can’t stand a partner who settles for less than extraordinary. Like fellow Aquarius, you feel strained when someone tries to pin you down, be it on a geographic or spiritual map.\nCapricorn (December 22 – January 19) \nYou move away from people who ask you for too much space. You’re an advocate of working together through issues when it comes to love, and you find it difficult to move forward in a relationship when a partner doesn’t stand by your side. You like things clear, and will often prefer to leave rather than feel abandoned.\nAquarius (January 20 – February 18) \nYou’re a free spirit and a thinker. You embrace humanitarian values and have great understanding of spirituality. You want to live your life fully without compromise and you question every aspect of it with great curiosity because you believe evolution is the key to any successful relationship. While your openness is your greatest asset, it’s also your greatest challenge. You find it hard to thrive next to someone whose values are rigid or who can’t adapt to your fluid nature and raw sensitivity. You loathe jealousy, old world morals or limitations in a partner because you believe these prevent both you and your partner from growing as individuals.\nPisces (February 19 – March 20) \nWhen someone hurts your sensitivity, you’d rather cut your losses than deal with excruciating amounts of pain. You appreciate a calm, soulful and invested relationship and will move away from anyone who likes to argue a lot or has a temper.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:01:15.919+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
