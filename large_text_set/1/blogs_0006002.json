Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nbeing a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nBet all those politicians who warned Trump’s continued connection to the TV series would constitute a conflict of interest feel pretty foolish now. They have warned Trump would use his considerable influence as POTUS to promote his various businesses. Trump has shown them: this morning using his influence to run down this business interest! \nCelebrity Apprentice got off to a rocky start with new host Schwarzenegger. The reality series’ eighth season starter — and first without original star Trump — logged a 1.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 4.9 million viewers. That is down 46% from the most recent Season 7 debut two years ago, and ties an all-time Live+Same Day low for the celebrity version of the business-themed reality series executive produced by the President-elect. \nThe tweets, coming at the expense of the show on which – it’s worth repeating – Trump remains executive producer, appear to be intended to ding two-term California Gov. Schwarzenegger, who was named host when Trump bowed out to run for the White House. The body builder turned Hollywood celebrity is a Republican and, during the election cycle, first endorsed Ohio Gov/White House hopeful John Kasich, then had the temerity to announce he would not vote for GOP presidential candidate Trump in the wake of that ’05 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump is heard boasting about being so famous he can grope women with impunity. \nTrump took the time to publicly critique the NBC series’ performance after urging Americans to show up for his inauguration to which most celebrities appear intended to give a pass: Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D.C. on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 \nAnd, after blasting Celebrity Apprentice’s performance, our next president moved on to weightier matters: celebrity editor Anna Wintour having come to his office to ask him to meet with Conde Nast editors which, Trump advises, he would do this morning. It has been reported they will be joined by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, the man who famously called him a “short-fingered vulgarian” in the late 80’s and, hopefully these two titans will thrash out their differences over Trump’s digits: Anna Wintour came to my office at Trump Tower to ask me to meet with the editors of Conde Nast & Steven Newhouse, a friend.
