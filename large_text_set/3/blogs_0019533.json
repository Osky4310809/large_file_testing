That’s not a message I want them to have.”\nAnd in terms of handling a few new wrinkles on her face? She embraces them. “I’m okay with having lines,” the star said. “I’m almost 50, I want people to know I’ve smiled a lot!”\nRELATED PHOTOS: PEOPLE Perks! 9 Stylish Pieces to Shop from White House Black Market With Our Exclusive 25% Discount \nHill, who’s prepping for her upcoming first-ever joint tour with husband and country singer Tim McGraw (“We want to give something completely different!”), said in the couple’s rare off-time, they like to make dates low-key.\n“A big date for us is actually an afternoon movie,” Hill said in her interview with NewBeauty . “I’ll wear a sundress, some mascara and a red lip, which is kind of new for me. I was always a nude lip person, but one day I tried red and loved it.”\nBut McGraw’s favorite look to see on his wife of 20 years : barefaced and beautiful. “He likes when I have no makeup on and crazy-curly hair. Before I put it up in a ponytail, he always tells me to wear it down because it’s his favorite,” Hill said.\nRELATED PHOTOS: PEOPLE Perks!

Early in my career, I did the high-school perm—why would I do that? I already have curly hair! And I used to wear tons of makeup, like that ’80s caked-on makeup. It’s the reason I rarely wear it now unless I absolutely have to.”\nShe also avoids trends (sticking to her favorite color black) and stocks up on basic pieces that can be worn a million different ways.\n“A nice tight black sweater and a good pair of jeans—I’ve had some jeans for 10 years—is always good,” she said. “The thing I’ve learned more than anything is to be comfortable and stay true to what I like.”\nWhat do you think about Faith’s NewBeauty cover?
