This grant included holding training events across the country. When not enough mental health events happened, normal membership-type events were counted in the final grant report as mental health events. \n“This is not something that the staff is okay with and not something the staff would do on their own,” he said. “This is about a fundamental culture at IAVA that Paul has created.” \n“Paul is the mastermind of this stuff.” \nAnother program former staffers spoke to was the Rapid Response Referral Program, which has suffered chronic staffing issues. While RRRP had grants to hire the employees necessary to complete the task, the money has allegedly been spent elsewhere. \nSeveral former employees said that at one point, RRRP was funded for nine social workers, but had only four. Management consistently told employees that they had no money for more employees. \nThe program has never in its entire existence had nine staffers, according to a source. \nRRRP is intended to help veterans coming home transition seamlessly back into the civilian world. \nA second former employee, who worked as a grant writer, told IAVA management in early 2015 that grants had reached “new lows of noncompliance” and expressed frustration that the organization was bleeding away its grant money because it kept disappointing or offending grant foundations by not achieving basic grant goals. \n“[W]e essentially threw away our grants … because as an organization–as a culture–we can’t be bothered with grants compliance, even though grants keep us afloat.” \nStill a third former employee with direct knowledge of the grant process said reports were exaggerated and doctored to reflect things that either didn’t happen at the scale reported or didn’t happen at all. \n“There would be discussion about what needed to be included in a grant to make the funders happy, but that wouldn’t necessarily include facts,” this third former employee said. \n“In an effort to be honest, I would say ‘Well, this isn’t real, this didn’t happen’–and I would just be rebuffed.” \nSometimes officers rebuffed the corrections. Other times, Paul himself would reportedly rewrite huge portions of the grant to include accomplishments that were simply fabrications, in order to please donors, the third former employee said. \nSince IAVA takes an enormous amount of pictures of each of its events and posts them to social media, this employee added that it would be fairly easy to cross-reference events written up in grants with photos publicly available. If there aren’t any publicly available photos of an event listed in a grant, it likely never happened. \n“There were some definite issues around grant compliance,” a fourth employee added. “If anyone ever looked at the books, the problems would be obvious.” \nStaffers also spoke to an environment of extreme paranoia, micromanagement and pressure to fill job roles that had nothing to do with their current positions. When employees decide to leave, one former staffer said that “they become the enemy.” \nAs such, turnover has been a prominent issue at the highest levels. In 2016, the CFO left a resignation letter on his desk the day of a board meeting. All six employees on the communications team, management included, had departed by mid-2016, leaving just one person in 2017 to man the desk. \nSince the organization has such problems with staffing, employees are routinely asked to fill functions far beyond the scope of their job descriptions. \nA fifth former and senior employee said that the incredibly high turnover rate was indicative of Paul’s terrible management and pointed to reviews of the organization on Glassdoor, a site where employees rate organizations . \n“I’ve never seen a company torn apart like IAVA,” the senior employee said. \n“I would also say in some ways Paul was abusive. He would be very demeaning of people, frankly including me. Micromanaging to an insane level.” \n“Everybody is right down the line about this, he scares good talent away. I’m not saying that about myself. The people who are really good and want to do good things and think they’re coming into a great organization, I saw them head out the door really quickly,” he added. \nSeveral other problems have plagued IAVA over the last several years. \nOther former employees, particularly female and minority employees, told TheDCNF they were used as pawns and paraded around in front of donors, told they would receive promotions and then were later totally disregarded. \nOne former female veteran employee said IAVA is continually hiring more and more civilians, who lack any kind of experience working with or relating to veterans. Veterans are apparently quite poorly treated at IAVA, in comparison to civilians. And morale is so bad at IAVA, she added, that many current employees are starting to send out their resumes to other organizations. \nFormer employees have further noted that the organization has drifted leftward in alignment with Reickhoff’s priorities, despite the fact that the drift has alienated many of the veterans who are disappointed that the non-partisan nature of the organization exists in name-only. Veterans hit back hard against IAVA during this past presidential election for excluding Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson from the commander-in-chief forum at a time when Johnson was the most popular candidate with veterans. \nThe problems are so horrendous that a letter dating back to 2014 allegedly written by now-former IAVA employees has recently surfaced. The letter, directed to IAVA’s board, asks for Reickhoff to step down as CEO, citing a long history of poor relations with donors, high staff turnover and misspending grant funds. \nIAVA did not respond to a request for comment from TheDCNF by press time. Calls to Reickhoff’s personal cell phone went unanswered. \nSend tips to [email protected] .
