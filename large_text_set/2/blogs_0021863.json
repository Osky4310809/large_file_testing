What this essentially means is that for Lenovo-owned Motorola, India is a huge market. This was further augmented by the fact that Moto mentioned at the launch event in Barcelona that it currently sits firmly in the second spot among smartphones in India. Therefore, we were slightly surprised by the change in strategy this year. The Moto G5 and the G5 Plus were launched at the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017. The phones are priced at $199 (approximately Rs 14,000) for the G5 and its elder sibling is available for $279 (approximately Rs 19,000) in the US. There is no word yet on a global launch. Here are our first impressions of both the new phones. First things first, there is not much separating the G5 and the G5 Plus. On the face of it, both the smartphones look extremely similar so much so that we had a tough time distinguishing between the two phones at the event. However, there are differences. The G5 has a smaller 5-inch display compared to the 5.2-inch one on the G5 Plus. But, both the phones offer a full HD resolution. In the limited time with the phones, we found the displays to be fairly bright and the colours, accurate. The other difference is that the G5 comes with a removable rear cover, which means that the 2,800mAh battery inside it can be dislodged as well. In comparison, the G5 Plus comes with a 3,000mAh non-removable battery. Now, if you have to ask us, we like a removable battery and the option of carrying a secondary battery for emergencies. Also, the slight 200mAh bump is not going to make a significant change actually. However, the biggest difference between the two phones is that the G5 Plus comes with a 12MP, F/1.7, dual-pixel camera sensor. The dual-pixel technology is something that is also present on the Samsung Galaxy S7 ( review ). It is great that Motorola managed to bring this tech to a mid-range smartphone. In comparison, the Moto G5 has a 13MP, F/2.0 sensor. Don’t get fooled by the bump in resolution, the G5 Plus will definitely capture better images. That said, we did notice that the focussing and shooting speeds on both the phones are almost on par. Also note that the G5 Plus can shoot 4K videos and the G5 cannot. Both the phones come with 5MP selfie cameras each. You get a Snapdragon 430 SoC with 3GB of RAM on the Moto G5. On the other hand, you get a Snapdragon 625 SoC with 4GB of RAM on the G5 Plus. We love the fact that Motorola has used the Snapdragon 625 on the Moto G5 Plus. It is one of our favourite SoCs thanks to its insane performance-to-battery life ratio. As far as the storage is concerned, the Moto G5 comes in two storage variants 16GB and 32GB, with the option to add 256GB more using a microSD card. Similarly, the Moto G5 Plus comes with 32GB of storage and a higher variant with 64GB of storage. Once again, you can upgrade it to up to 256GB using an external card. Do take a look at some of the images of the two phones in the gallery below: 1 of 15 One thing to note is that both the phones are carved out of metal, which makes them sturdy and the most premium-looking Moto G phones yet. We quite liked the design actually. Also, the phones are available in two colour variants – Lunar Grey and Fine Gold. We noticed that the Fine Gold variant has an ugly black border around the edges of the display. Talking about the software, Moto has implemented Android Nougat with the Pixel launcher. It looks neat and easy to use. Moreover, you also get Google Assistant with it. How cool is that? Overall, the Moto G5 and G5 Plus include upgrades that we’ve always wanted in the G5 series. What do you think? Will you wait for these phones to launch in India or buy something else?
