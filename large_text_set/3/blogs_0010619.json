Buhari returned to the country in the early hours of Friday from London, United Kingdom, where he had been on medical sojourn since January 19. Shortly after meeting some state governors and top government officials led by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the First Lady Conference Hall, Buhari retired into his official residence. The President, who was conspicuously absent at the Jumat service held inside the mosque close to his office later in the day, has not been seen in public since then. Our correspondent, who monitored events at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, for a few hours on Saturday reported that Buhari remained indoors throughout the day. “The President is indoors. He is spending time with his family members. You know he has been away for a long time. There is the need for them to catch up on some issues since he travelled,” a source said. Our corespondent also observed that the Presidential Villa was devoid of heavy vehicular movement that always characterises the visits of prominent politicians and top government officials. A security source said but for a few family members and close friends, Buhari has not been receiving visitors since he returned on Friday. The President had shortly after returning to the country urged those who might be considering sending delegations to welcome him to stay back and continue to pray for the country. His Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, had said the President would on Monday transmit a letter to the National Assembly formally informing the federal lawmakers of his return from vacation. Meanwhile, as Buhari formally resumes work on Monday, expectations are high that decisions would be taken on some national issues in the course of the week. One of such issues, our correspondent learnt, is the posting of the nation’s career ambassadors-designate. The President had on December 19, 2016 opened an induction course organised for the ambassadors-designate by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. About three months after, they have not been posted. When our correspondent raised the issue with Adesina on Saturday, he simply said, “Please bring this up again after the President has resumed duty for a while.” Another issue that the President will be expected to address urgently on resumption, it was further learnt, is the filling of two vacancies that currently exist in the Federal Executive Council.
