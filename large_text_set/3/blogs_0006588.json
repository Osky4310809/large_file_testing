The move is still in the early stages, but if all goes well the place should be up and running by early summer.\nIf you haven’t had the joy of experiencing Crackin’ Kitchen yet, just know that the spot is massively popular in Waikiki, and sits just steps from the beach. The restaurant follows a familiar pattern of DIY seafood enjoyment, where shellfish and sides are ordered by the pound and splayed out of the table to dig into barehanded. \nIt’s a model that has already proven immensely popular at places like The Boiling Crab stateside , though Crackin’ Kitchen has the added benefit of using some more localized Hawaiian flavors and serving rather inventive cocktails.\nCrackin’ Kitchen takes over the former Live Mixx Lounge location along Colorado Boulevard, just east of the main Old Pasadena drag. An email in to the company in Hawaii confirms the expansion, though an exact timetable is still forthcoming. In the meantime, get a feel for what’s to come with this interactive walk-through of the Honolulu original.\nCrackin’ Kitchen \n115 E.
