Photo by, Peter Rae Monday 6 February 2017. Photo: Peter Rae \nFebruary would \"really have to cool off a lot for more records not be broken\", Dr Martin said. \nSo far this summer, average daytime temperatures in Sydney are running about 3 degrees above average, while nighttime temperatures are about 2.5 degrees warmer than normal, he said. \nThe western suburbs also came close to setting records on Monday. Richmond's top of 38.9 degrees by mid-afternoon left it just shy of breaking the record of eight days above 40 degrees set in the 1939-40 and 1979-80 summers, while Penrith's top of 39 degrees so far also left it shy of setting a record of 11 days above 40 degrees. More on the way \nBoth sites, though, should have multiple chances of setting new high marks later this week, when the next burst of scorching heat arrives. \nAccording to the bureau, much of eastern NSW should be in for a severe heatwave for the three days from Friday, with a pocket of the north-east looking at extreme conditions. (See chart below.) Moree extended its run of consecutive days above 35 degrees to 43 on Monday, with at least six more to come. That series could challenge the state's record of 50 such days set in Bourke in 2012-13. Among the many places to beat thresholds in NSW this summer include Cessnock airport, which has posted nine days above 40 degrees so far this summer. Its previous high was five such days in 2012 in records that go back 48 years. \nOvernight temperature records are also falling at inland sites such as Brewarrina, where there have been 28 days within minimums above 25 degrees, beating the previous record fo 26 set in 2005 - with three more weeks of summer to add to this season's tally. \nCoastal areas, particularly near Sydney, have also been kept warm at night by very warm waters offshore. Sea-surface temperatures near Sydney are running at about 24 degrees. Rain to come \nSydney's gardens should get some welcome rains on Tuesday and Wednesday, with showers and even rain periods possible. \nLast month's water use was Sydney's highest for any month since January 2003, a spokesman for Sydney Water said. \nSunday maintained the recent surge in water use, too. Demand reached 2.215 billion litres and exceeded the 14-year peak demand in usage recorded just six days earlier, he said. \nWeatherzone is owned by Fairfax Media, publisher of this website. â€‹ Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:53:52.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
