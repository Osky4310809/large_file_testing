The featurette not only shows us behind the scenes footage from the first couple weeks of filming, but also provides some clues as what we should expect from the story.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War featurette Watch the Avengers: Infinity War featurette embedded below:\nAction… @Avengers #InfinityWar pic.twitter.com/KHo8wlNVZc \n— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) February 11, 2017 \n\nWe see Tom Holland (Spider-Man), Chris Pratt (Star-Lord) and Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark) on set at Pinewood for day one of shooting, talking about the prospect of the film that lays ahead of them.\nKevin Feige gives us a recap of how we got here, the connectivity of the Marvel cinematic universe, and explaining how the purpose of Captain America: Civil War was to tear the Avengers team apart before the threat of Thanos reunites them in Avengers: Infinity War.\nDirectors Anthony and Joe Russo talk about how Tony Stark feels this greater threat approaching and how he is doing everything in his power to keep the earth safe. We see concept art of Tony Stark standing in front of a line-up of Iron Man armors.\nKevin Feige promises that Thanos will show us why he is the biggest, the badest, the best and most frightening villain the Avengers have ever faced. The featurette concluded with a tease of what we had already known: The Avengers will meet the Guardians of the Galaxy. We see concept art of Rocket Raccoon firing his gun with the mighty Thor in the background.\nThe post Must Watch: ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ Featurette Gets Us Ready For The War Ahead appeared first on /Film .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:54:24.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
