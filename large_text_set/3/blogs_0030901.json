Terrill Associated Press file 1 of 2 i \nBy Taryn Luna \nCalifornia Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León on Monday called Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ plan to block Justice Department grant funding to sanctuary cities “nothing short of blackmail.” \nDuring a daily press briefing earlier in the day, Sessions said the Justice Department will require compliance with immigration laws in order for cities to receive grants through the Office of Justice Programs, according to The Associated Press. The news organization reported that the Obama administration had a similar policy in place. \nAlthough definitions vary, sanctuary cities, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, typically refuse to help the federal government enforce immigration laws. During the campaign, President Donald Trump pledged to take federal funding away from sanctuary cities. \n“When it comes to immigrants and sanctuary counties and cities, the Attorney and the President are stuck on alternative facts,” de León said in a statement. \n“Instead of making us safer, the Trump administration is spreading fear and promoting race-based scapegoating. Their gun-to-the-head method to force resistant cities and counties to participate in Trump’s inhumane and counterproductive mass-deportation is unconstitutional and will fail.” \nDe León pointed to a report by the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute in Washington, that found lower crime rates in sanctuary cities compared to non-sanctuary cities. \nSeveral bills moving through the California Legislature are related to sanctuary cities. \nDe León is pushing SB 54 , which prohibits state and local law enforcement in California from using their resources to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement. A recent amendment requires state prisons and county jails to notify the FBI 60 days before releasing an undocumented immigrant with a violent felony conviction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-28T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-28T02:16:14.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
