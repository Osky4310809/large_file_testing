The little boy checks the mail 100 times a day and pressures his aunt, Emily Giese, to write him postcards so that he'll have something in the box when the mail finally does arrive. Logan's mailman, Wes Winter, has noticed the boy waiting for him — once in just a t-shirt and his USPS baseball cap in 30 degree weather — and delivered a package with a letter to the \"little mailman\" to tell him that he was starting a new job and wouldn't be seeing him anymore.\n\"Hello Little Mailman . . . \" Wes starts his adorable letter, which Emily shared to Facebook. \"I only met you once. It was cold outside and I was running late. You were sitting on the porch waiting for me to come around. You were wearing a tee-shirt and USPS baseball cap and it was probably 30 degrees, but you didn't care, you just wanted to see the mailman. I don't know why, but it meant a lot to me, little dude.\"\nRelated:\nAdorable 4-Year-Old Idolizes His Mailman and Helps Him With Route Every Day\nThat one day stuck with Wes, so he decided to do something special for Logan before starting his new job.\nADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flovewhatreallymatters%2Fposts%2F1448257921863268&width=500", "https://www.facebook.com/lovewhatreallymatters/posts/1448257921863268"], "published": "2017-03-20T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-20T20:48:36.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
