The regular menu will be offered starting March 25. \nLuke (Anthony Lucidonio Jr.) and his father and brother Nicky have been embroiled in litigation for more than a year over business dealings - a topic that he declined to discuss. \nActing wise, Luke and fellow Philadelphian Craig Shoemaker are working on a buddy-comedy/reality series for BBC Worldwide called Funny Food (premise: Luke shows Shoemaker how food is made at great hideaway eateries, and Shoemaker takes Luke to comedy venues to see if he can deliver). \nLuke will open for Shoemaker for five shows March 30 to April 1 at Helium .
