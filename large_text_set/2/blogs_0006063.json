Somehow get what's in your head out there in the world, whether that means writing it down in a journal or on little three-by-five index cards, covering your desk and your fridge and your walls with Post-its, or making voice memos,\" he told Science of Us . \"Some ways of doing that are more elaborate than others, but anything that gets it out of the head is a good thing.\" \nTaking time to note your mental health on paper could ultimately help to make you more productive, too. \"We should make time and space to alternate\" between focus and \"mind-wandering attentional mode,\" Levitin said. \"The research tells us that if you can take time off from your workflow and let your mind wander ‚Äî maybe doodle, listen to music, draw pictures, just stare out the window ‚Äî those periods of inactivity are actually essential to having productive periods of activity.\" \nOne way to take Kyra's method a step further is to take time at the end of every tracking period to think of ways to have more positive days in the upcoming month. Perhaps you could spend some time actually drawing out the ways you'll try to improve those days and enhance your productivity in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:37:48.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
