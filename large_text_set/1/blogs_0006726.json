(Photo: Getty)     \nChelsea had their attack to thank for their place in the FA Cup fourth round. \nNormal service was resumed as two-goal Pedro, Michy Batshuayi and Willian helped the ten-man Blues put their midweek defeat against Tottenham behind them to ease past Peterborough, 4-1 . \nBut normal for the Stamford Bridge side these days increasingly looks like it no longer includes John Terry . \nStalwart Terry was back in the team, making his first start since October. But the 36-year-old had a miserable return, looked shaky throughout and this uncomfortable comeback was capped when he was sent off in the second half for a clumsy challenge on Lee Angol. \nBranislav Ivanovic, 32, also struggled as a right wing-back and at centre-back against the plucky League One visitors. \nKurt Zouma could at least be forgiven on the couple of occasions he looked rusty, as he was making his first appearance for 11 months after a serious knee injury.

Batshuayi grabbed Chelsea’s other goal but was also frustratingly wasteful as he failed to make the most of his big chance to impress Conte in a rare start. \nPeterborough took a leaf out of Tottenham’s book in Chelsea’s first game since their aura of invincibility was shattered by their London rivals on Wednesday night. \nHe had vowed to go after the Blues, boss Grant McCann was true to his word. Pedro opened the scoring after 18 minutes...

And they weren’t overawed on the ball either, raiding forward as they ambitiously went toe-to-toe with the Premier League leaders. \nThe League One side’s much-talked about young talents Marcus Maddison and Leonardo Da Silva Lopes looked comfortable on the big Stamford Bridge stage. \nAnd Chelsea’s uncertainty at the back – Terry, Zouma and Ivanovic were all guilty of giving the ball away early on – only gave Posh further encouragement. \nWhat they lacked, until it was too late, was a ruthlessness in front of goal. Batshuayi doubled Chelsea's lead just before halftime...

Defender Ryan Tafazolli also sent a free header wide. \nTo cause an upset, they are the sort of chances that simply have to be taken. \nAs well as predicting Chelsea could be vulnerable, McCann had also warned about their threat on the break. \nBut it is one thing knowing about it, and another trying to stop it. \nPeterborough couldn’t, and paid the price twice before half-time as their determination to play got them in trouble. Tom Nichols gave the away fans something to remember with their consolation goal (Photo: Reuters) \nPedro showed them how it is done, keeping his cool to smash Chelsea ahead after they were gifted possession by Michael Smith’s misplaced pass. \nThe goal-scorer also hit the bar after another lightning counter, before Batshuayi finished off a four-versus-two breakaway to make it 2-0. \nLuke McGee, who delayed Chelsea opening the scoring with saves from Gary Cahill and Terry, denied Willian a third with his feet. But the Brazilian beat the on-loan Spurs keeper in the 52nd minute, after being teed up by Pedro. \nTerry’s dismissal and Tom Nichols’ souvenir goal with 20 minutes gave the visitors a glimmer of hope, but Pedro curled in his second five minutes later to kill Peterborough off once and for all. poll loading Is it time for John Terry to leave Chelsea? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-09T02:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-08T22:16:39.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
