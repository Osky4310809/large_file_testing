The Marvel superheroes who we’ve seen on Netflix in shows like Jessica Jone s and Daredevil actually had action figures on display way back at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016 — but it appears that now we’re very close to actually being able to own the figures.\nAnd yay, we’re getting an awesome Jessica Jones action figure, which is basically Jessica in her usual clothes since she doesn’t need any special cape to be epic. Jessica Jones herself Krysten Ritter posted a photo of one of the amazing action figures on her Instagram.\nWell, this doesn't happen every day! First I'm a #funkopop and now an ACTION FIGURE! Go Jessica Jones! EPIC! So proud. \nA post shared by Krysten Ritter (@therealkrystenritter) on Feb 20, 2017 at 2:27pm PST \nIn case you have Jessica Jones action figure fever, you can also grab an adorable Jessica Jones Funko Pop! for your personal collection. It’s pretty much perfect.\nFunko Don’t get too excited though, we still have a while to wait until Season 2 of Jessica Jones and it seems as if everyone is pretty much wanting it to be released like yesterday! Admit it, we’re all stoked for more Jessica Jones .\nStill can't believe we have to wait until 2018 for Jessica Jones season 2.\n— Badass Shaw (@calliesunshine5) February 16, 2017 I'm still waiting for season 2 of Jessica Jones\n— Sam (@samtrevinoo) February 15, 2017 Oh okay cool Iron Fist trailer WHERE IS JESSICA JONES SEASON 2 THOUGH\n— stacey (@theravensmoon) February 7, 2017 If it hasn’t been blatantly obvious before, it’s pretty clear now that the world is desperate for more Jessica Jones . Unfortunately, Season 2 won’t be released until 2018. Until then, just have fun playing with your new action figures until The Defenders is released later this year.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:27:24.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
