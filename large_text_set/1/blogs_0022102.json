Philadelphia will receive a player to be named later or cash considerations in the deal. \nGonzalez had been designated for assignment recently to clear roster space for the signing of Michael Saunders . Now, he’ll head to the Phils’ N.L. East rivals in Miami, who have already accumulated quite a few other pitchers over the winter. Gonzalez is still optionable, which increases his appeal. \nThe 24-year-old Gonzalez has shown intriguing K/BB numbers in his 66 MLB frames (8.5 K/9 against 1.9 BB/9), but he owns an ugly 6.68 ERA. He has always shown excellent control in the minors, and did boast 35 strikeouts and a 3.13 ERA over his 36 innings last year at Triple-A after shifting to a full-time relief role.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-25T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-25T01:41:40.159+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
