He did things ‘his’ way. Not always right, not always wrong, but [he] always followed what he believed in,” the former WWE cruiserweight champion wrote. “He was diagnosed with liver cancer in early January of this year. As believer in Christ Jesus, he is now in Paradise. Today is a sad day in the Guerrero family. Rest in peace Chavo ‘Classic’ Guerrero Sr.” he added, along with the hashtags #rip #nowinheaven. Known to the WWE universe as “Chavo Classic”, Guerrero made a name for himself in Japan in the 1970s and made his way to Los Angeles’ NWA Hollywood Wrestling between 1975 and 1980. The eldest son of WWE legend Gory Guerrero and older brother of also deceased star Eddie Guerrero first introduced himself to the WWE audience in 2004, when he managed both his son and brother in feuds with Rey Mysterio. Chavo Classic even competed in several matches and at one point became the oldest WWE cruiserweight champion in history. Shortly after his passing, the WWE also expressed condolences to his bereaved family. “WWE is saddened to learn that Chavo Guerrero Sr., the legendary wrestler, brother of WWE hall-of-famer Eddie Guerrero and father of Chavo Guerrero, Jr., passed away Saturday at age 68,” the company wrote, along with details of his brief history with the company. “WWE extends its condolences to Chavo Guerrero Sr.’s family, friends and fans.” Khristian Ibarrola", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:44:53.969+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
