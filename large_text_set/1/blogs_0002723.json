I’m so terribly to have to tell you that humans like this walk among us. But I’m a firm believe in that’s bad for the goose is bad for the gander and that means when I see this picture then you all have to as well. \n\nHaving said that, let’s talk about this. I consider myself a 21st century man. I don’t judge books by their cover (that’s a total lie, I judge every book and person by their cover. I don’t even read the inside flap. You got a bad cover? You’re a bad person), I don’t get out of Ubers and run screaming if, say, it’s a woman driving. That’s not me. However, if this man had the AUDACITY to wave this… this…. this “hand” in my face I’d have no choice but to demand his swift firing. I get bad enough motion sickness in Ubers, I don’t need this sickness on top of it. You want a fair rating? Gnaw that extra pinky off like it’s a hangnail. Grab a knife and go all pain Olympics on your right hand. If gore isn’t your thing, wear a fucking mitten everywhere like an even weirder Michael Jackson. Just make sure I never know I’m in the same car as that GODDAMN hand.
