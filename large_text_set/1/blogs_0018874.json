A total of 108 precision-guided bombs fell on the camps, killing an estimated 85 terrorists. \nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Thursday that some of those killed in the attack were thought to be actively plotting attacks in Europe. \n“We need to strike ISIL everywhere they show up. And that’s particularly true in view of the fact that we know some of the ISIL operatives in Libya were involved with plotting attacks,” Carter said.
