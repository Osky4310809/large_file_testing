And now, another one — Anna Victoria, a freakin’ fitness model — is coming forward about how the right lighting can mask cellulite in any photo.\nIn a photo posted to her Instagram account, Anna shared two selfies: one in “good lighting” and one in “bad lighting,” wearing the same outfit and posing in the same way, to illustrate the different illusions .\n“Lighting. Is. Everything,” begins the side-by-side ‘s lengthy, empowering-as-hell caption. “99% of pictures you see on social media are taken in the best possible lighting and that ain’t no accident.” Lighting. Is. Everything. 99% of pictures you see on social media are taken in the best possible lighting and that ain't no accident so when I got into the elevator with the lighting on the right, I zoned in on the cellulite on the back of my arms. Yes, cellulite on your arms is a thing! I've had it since the beginning of my journey and while it's lightened up since then, it's still not totally gone... because I'm human. Seriously, girls, stop thinking you're the only one with cellulite and that it's some kind of disease! Yes, it absolutely can be reduced through healthy diet, exercise and proper water intake, but another component which you can't control is genetics, and just being human. It's not bad to want to reduce the sight of cellulite just like it's not bad to want to lose weight and feel more confident overall, but don't set out to lose weight JUST to have less cellulite. It can be a cherry on top of all the other amazing benefits. If you ask me how to reduce the appearance of cellulite, my answer will be: healthy diet, regular exercise and proper water intake - that's it. I will not suggest creams or wraps or whatever else the current fad is because those are only short term fixes (IF that..) and perpetuate the idea that health/results can be found in a bottle/package. So, do I love the look of my arms on the right? No, but I don't hate it or myself for it, either. And you shouldn't either ❤️ #fbggirls #realtalk #cellulite www.annavictoria.com/guides \nA post shared by Snapchat: AnnaVictoriaFit (@annavictoria) on Feb 19, 2017 at 12:34pm PST \nAnna, who has amassed an impressive 1.3 million Instagram followers, went on to point out that as healthy of a lifestyle as you live, there are certain things about your body that you can’t change — nor should you have to!\n“Seriously, girls, stop thinking you’re the only one with cellulite and that it’s some kind of disease!” she writes. “Yes, it absolutely can be reduced through healthy diet, exercise , and proper water intake, but another component you can’t control is genetics, and just being human.” \nCan we just say how touched by and proud of Anna we are? In a world where Photoshop and social media filters reign supreme, we fully applaud the realistic message women are spreading to impressionable young women who are likely looking to them for inspiration.\nPlus, Anna is 100 percent right about that dimply skin we seem to shy away from admitting we have. While mostly absent from advertisements, cellulite affects 90 percent of women and 10 percent of men . Really.\nAnd we’re happy to say Anna isn’t the only popular Instagram account with a super-honest, body-positive owner. From pregnant women to fitness bloggers, the internet has become an amazing place of support for anyone who has wrestled with body image.\n\nThank you for continuing to shine a light on this, Anna! You are reminding the world that each and every one of us is beautiful — cellulite and all.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T02:02:37.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
