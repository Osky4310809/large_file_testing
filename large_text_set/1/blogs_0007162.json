You’re going to see a lot of me in the future.” \nDjokovic, who turned professional in 2003, celebrates his 30th birthday in May this year. \nEarlier this week in Doha he played against 38-year-old Radek Stepanek, one of the oldest players on the ATP tour. \nAfter beating the Czech veteran, Djokovic said he was “excited” about the longevity of Stepanek’s career. \n“It shows me that I can have as long a career as he has. If he can do it, I can do it, too,” said Djokovic. \nThe oldest player currently in the top 20 is 37-year-old Ivo Karlovic. \nThe Croat is currently ranked number 20 in the world and, notably, was the last player to Djokovic in Doha in 2015. \nThe oldest ever winner of a Grand Slam in the Open era is Ken Rosewall, who won the Australian Open in 1972 aged 37.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T09:35:09.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
