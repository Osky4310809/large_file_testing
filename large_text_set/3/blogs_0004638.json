That being the case, it’s only right that the Duke star created more headlines in the Blue Devils’ regular season game against arch-rival North Carolina.\nWhile driving to the basket late in the first half, Allen hit UNC freshman Brandon Robinson with what some might categorize as an intentional elbow to the face. \nPerhaps the most egregious aspect of the play, at least in the eyes of many viewers, is that Allen’s acting job resulted in a personal foul being called against Robinson. The officials then went to the monitors, reviewed the play, and hit Allen with a dead ball contact technical foul as well. \nAt this point you almost have to admire Allen. He’s like an actor taking on more challenging roles as time passes in order to avoid becoming stale. \nYou can’t just trip dudes forever, or else you end up being Vin Diesel praying to God that they’re going to make an 18th “Fast and Furious” movie. You’ve gotta venture out and THEN return to your wheelhouse like Matt Damon with the Bourne movies. Having said that, you have to really commit to the new genre, no screwing around. That’s why the forearm/flop combination is so impressive. Grayson Allen’s not about to go down like Adam Sandler trying to make Reign over Me and Spanglish more than what they are.\nIt almost makes you want to applaud. Or break something. Definitely one of the two. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-05T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-05T04:37:15.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
