Soon one-star ratings will cease to be a thing on Netflix — or five-star ratings, for that matter.\nThe new Siskel & Ebert-ian system was revealed by Netflix executive Tod Yellin at a press briefing at the company’s headquarters in Los Gatos, California on Thursday, Variety reported and EW confirmed.\nThe executive said Netflix tested the new system last year and found that users volunteered 200 percent more ratings when faced with a simple up or down choice than when having five options — so the system will result in more feedback from viewers.\nYellin also noted that the review system has been less important over the years as the company has found users will often rank respected documentaries with five stars and more frivolous titles with one star despite being far more likely to actually watch the latter. (It’s true; many popular guilty-pleasure favorites like Armageddon are saddled with one-star averages despite having plenty of fans).\nStill, it’s hard not to feel like the new method gives users less information — a four-star average feels rather different than five-star average even though both would receive the same thumbs up.\nThe shakeup comes on the heels of Amy Schumer accusing “alt-right trolls” of conspiring to flood her latest Netflix special with one-star reviews.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-17T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-17T00:21:41.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
