He disclosed that the two refineries are producing about five million litres of Automotive Gasoline Oil, AGO, as well as Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, and Household Kerosene, HHK. \nHowever, he stated that in January 2017, all the four refineries were working, until a few days ago, when the Warri refinery was shut down due to some technical faults. \n“The only refinery that is having some issues is the one in Warri, because we have a bit of a power challenge and we are working very hard with General Electric, GE, to address that. But in January all of them were working. The whole Port Harcourt refinery has come on stream and they are running well. \n“Meanwhile the Warri refinery had also started running but there is something with the gas turbine generators that tripped, so it was shut down to make sure we address that, but as you know you cannot start up the equipment without having negative things happen.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T00:46:23.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
