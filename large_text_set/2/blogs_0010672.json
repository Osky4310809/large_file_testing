Not only is watching the various birds come and go lots of fun but having a bird feeder is also vital to help birds thrive. Birds play an enormous role in our ecosystem. They are pest control masters, consuming tons of bugs and insects, which helps farmers grow vegetables and keep diseases that are transmittal to humans at bay. They are also excellent at planting trees, such as the Whitebark Pine which helps to protect drinking water supplies since its pines grow all the way up to the tree line. However, due to deforestation and habitat loss, an estimated 1,200 species of birds are facing extinction over the next century. \nJada Fitch , a wildlife artist and children’s book illustrator based in Portland, Maine has been an avid birder for years. She wanted to find a way to photograph birds up close and that’s how the concept of tiny, furnished bird feeders emerged. “I had the idea to make a little diorama to put in my window for the birds to land in, so I could get some close-up pictures. Both of my feeders are directly in front of my desk, so I see them come and go all day,” Fitch told Audobon. Fitch took a cardboard box, measured the interior “walls,” and cut paper accessories to size for gluing down after the paint job dried. She carved out a door and windows, and attached a little porch on the front of the structure to act as a perch. Painted throw rugs, framed “portraits” of bird family members and couches and armchairs were included. And of course, bird seed scattered on the floor. Fitch started posting updates to her blog and Instagram and soon people wanted one of the homes for their backyard. With the help of her husband, she has designed a series of feeders called “ Home Tweet Home “, which is a mini bird friendly version of the home Fitch lives in. To meet the high demand, Fitch created a second line of “Home Tweet Home” kits. Because the first “Home Tweet Homes” were made out of recycled cardboard, they couldn’t be permanently left outside in the elements. The latest version will be waterproof and will be sold for $12. \n\n\nThe primary material of the “Home Tweet Home” kits is coroplast, a nontoxic , corrugated plastic that’s often used for lawn campaign signs. The watercolors she’s using are also safe for wildlife. We love this unique and compassionate way to appreciate birds!
