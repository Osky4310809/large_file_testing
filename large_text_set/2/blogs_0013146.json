KHC's offer was $50 per share for UL, which come to a total value of $143 billion, an 18% premium to Unilever's closing price on Thursday, February 16th. For KHC, it makes perfect sense, and it makes perfect sense why Unilever rejected the deal. \nKHC reported its full-year results on February, 15th, disclosing total 2016 revenue of approximately $26.5 billion. Of that $18.6 billion came from the US or nearly 70%. The rest of the world came to $7.84 billion or 30% of top-line sales. \nUnilever's revenue is a spitting mirror image. One of the most appealing parts of Unilever is the company's focus on emerging markets and products that appeal to consumers globally. In emerging markets, the key is selling to individuals that are moving from lower-income to middle-income brackets. I pulled the number below from UL end of year SEC filing : \nThen, emerging markets versus developed markets: \nCurrently, analysts are projecting UL to have 2018 revenue $61.2 billion (€57.5 billion). However, since UL trades as an ADR here in the US and the offer price was $50, we will continue our analysis in dollar terms. UL had a market cap on February 16th of $128.7 billion. With estimates for 2018 sales around $61.2 billion, there is a price-sales multiple of about 2.1. Meanwhile, analysts expect 2018 EPS of $2.27, based on a closing price of $42.57, giving UL a 2018 forward P/E of 19. \nMeanwhile, KHC is expected to have 2018 EPS of $4.11 on revenue of $27.21 billion. At a closing price of $87.28 and a market cap of $106.24 billion on February 16th, KHC has a price to sales multiple of 3.9, and 2018 forward P/E of 21. \nAt the $50/share offer for Unilever, the $143 billion deal price would imply a 2018 forward P/E of 22 and a 2018 price to sales multiple of 2.3. This offer price values Unilever less than KHC. But that's not all! Analysts are expecting KHC to grow revenue from $26.67 billion in 2017 to $27.21 billion in 2018, a mere 2%. EPS is projected to increase from $3.77 in 2017 to $4.11 in 2018, or 9%, giving KHC a PEG ratio of 2.3. Meanwhile, analysts expect Unilever to grow revenue from $58.54 billion in 2017 to $61.20 in 2018, a growth rate of 4.5% (more than twice KHC's rate of revenue growth). Meanwhile, EPS is seen increasing from $2.12 in 2017 to $2.27 in 2018, a 7% comparable growth rate, giving the stock a PEG ratio of 2.7. \nThese numbers tell you why Unilever passed on the deal, and one could argue UL is trading at a discount to what KHC is worth. Let's look at Colgate ( CL ) and Procter & Gamble ( PG ), both of which have business models that are much more comparable to Unilever's model than KHC, to get a picture of what the offer should have been. \nThe chart above shows that UL trades at a discount to its 2018 forward P/E and its 2018 forward P/S multiple. All three companies are growing roughly at the same earnings and revenue rates. In fact, on a growth basis, PG is the most expensive with a PEG of 3.02. Meanwhile, both CL and PG trade price-to-sales multiples in the mid 3's, while UL is only at 2.10. The surprising thing here is that UL's revenue is expected to grow about two times faster than PG and at the same rate as CL. For UL to trade in line with CL and PG on a forward P/E basis, the stock would need to trade at $49. The comparisons make the KHC offer for UL seem even worse, considering the discount UL is already trading with compared to CL and PG. Meanwhile, on a price-to-sales multiple UL would have to trade at Market Cap of nearly $225 billion to equal the same valuations as PG and CL. With about 2.84 billion shares outstanding, that would equate to a price of about $78.62. Clearly, $50 is too low and $79 is too high. A twenty percent premium from $50 would take the shares to $60 and a market cap of $171 billion, which would give the stock a forward P/E of 26 and price to sales of 2.79. \nIf KHC wants global reach and more emerging market customers, they're going to have to pay more than $50/share for them. \nMichael Kramer and the clients of Mott Capital Management, LLC own shares of UL.
