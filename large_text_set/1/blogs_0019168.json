(Photo: Chris Humphreys, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. – It was quiet and mostly uneventful when the New England Patriots opened their locker room to reporters Thursday. \nThen tight end Martellus Bennett strolled to his stall and held court with about 35 media members. \nArguably the most quotable player in this locker room offered thoughts on his team and its playoff chances, and also answered a question about how his quarterback has looked this week. \nSaid Bennett: “I don’t have a Tom Brady mood ring.” \nHe may not have that, but he does bear significant responsibility this week. \nAs the Patriots gear up to face the Pittsburgh Steelers in Sunday evening’s AFC Championship Game, Bennett figures to be one of the key players whose potential success could be instrumental in punching another trip to the Super Bowl for the Patriots. \nTight end Rob Gronkowski was essential in New England’s 27-16 victory in Pittsburgh back in Week 7, catching all four of his targets for 93 yards and one touchdown. \nWith Gronkowski on injured reserve as he recovers from another back surgery, Bennett could become an integral part of the Patriot game plan Sunday, even though Pittsburgh’s defense is much different now than it was then. \nThe pass rush is surging, giving opposing quarterbacks a limited window to throw. Linebackers Bud Dupree and James Harrison – though 15 years apart – have injected consistency through their athleticism. And the secondary is peaking with rookie cornerback Artie Burns playing a larger role. \n“All their guys are playing (well),” Bennett said. “Harrison is playing well. He’s almost as old as my pops, and he’s still playing like a beast out there. They just have a lot of guys flying around and playing good football. I think they pursue the ball really well. They’re always looking to turn the ball over. Other than that, they’re just a physical front. And (defensive end Stephon) Tuitt is just a hell of a player as well. So we’ll have our hands full this week.” \nBennett caught 55 passes for 701 yards and a career-best seven touchdowns in the regular season. \nIn Saturday’s divisional-round victory against the Houston Texans, however, Bennett caught only one pass for 4 yards. \n“Marty has been such a great fit in here, man,” receiver Danny Amendola told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday. “And the thing is, some people might see his stat line and say: ‘Oh, well, he only caught one pass so he didn’t make an impact.’ He gives everything he has in the blocking game. He works. He does so much that other people on the outside don’t see.” \nOne other thing Bennett has brought to this locker room is an honest and outspoken personality that can be a relief. \nJust moments after the Steelers beat the Kansas City Chiefs in Sunday’s divisional \\-round playoff game, receiver Antonio Brown broadcasted a live video from the scene in the locker room, in which head coach Mike Tomlin can be heard off-camera calling the Patriots “a .” \nBoth Tomlin and Brown apologized for the incident, which has become one of the biggest storylines of the week. \n“I don’t give a s--- about his social media,” Bennett said. “I don’t follow him. Send some followers my way, Antonio. I’ve got better content.” \nBennett’s media sessions have become must-watch for local reporters in need of a quote. The 29-year-old veteran has reveled in the opportunity he has here. \nBennett did play in two playoff games in 2009 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys, but in his interactions with the media here, he has referred to this run as his first experience in the postseason. \nSo don’t let Bennett’s quips fool you, he said. \n“The last people I want to make laugh are on the other team,” Bennett said. “I want to make them hurt.” \nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL divisional weekend Facebook Posted!
