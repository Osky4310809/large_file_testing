Ready for another day at the transfer rumour mill coalface? Thought so. \nWe’re halfway through the January sales and things are starting to get very interesting. \nA total of £185million was spent by Premier League clubs a year ago and this month could well be a similar affair, with sides ready to open the chequebook again to bolster title charges, European pushes or survival campaigns. \nWill the Manchester clubs follow their big-spending summers with some more new faces? Should Jurgen Klopp bring in some more bodies as he tries to end Liverpool’s title drought? Will Arsene Wenger splash the cash? \nAnd what about the players that have been linked with moves away? Dimitri Payet is enemy number one in east London, while across town questions are being asked about Diego Costa’s future at Chelsea. \nWe will have all the latest news, views, opinion and, of course, those all-important done deals throughout the day so stick with us. \nWithout further ado, in the immortal words of Steven George Gerrard, we go again.
