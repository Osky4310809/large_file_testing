By Chris Serres Star Tribune March 22, 2017 — 6:43pm   A Christian counseling center owned by the husband of former congresswoman Michele Bachmann violated a series of state rules governing patient treatment and client records, according to a state correction order released Tuesday. Bachmann & Associates Inc., which does business as Counseling Care at clinics in Lake Emo and Burnsville, was cited for failing to keep information about its clients’ developmental condition, as well as failing to keep records demonstrating that clients were informed of treatment alternatives and possible outcomes, among other violations, the Minnesota Department of Human Services found. Marcus Bachmann, a therapist and president of Counseling Care, was traveling in Florida and could not be reached for comment, his staff said. In early February, state investigators reviewed 10 client records, and found that all 10 failed to comply with state rules governing the client assessment and diagnostic process. The clinic was cited for similar violations in 2005 and 2009. The clinic was given 30 days to submit records demonstrating compliance. During his wife’s failed presidential campaign, Dr. Bachmann faced questions over whether his clinics provided “reparative therapy,” a controversial form of psychotherapy that seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation from gay to straight. Bachmann has denied that his clinics provide such counseling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-23T01:46:57.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
