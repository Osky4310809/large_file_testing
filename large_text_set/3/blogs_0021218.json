Last weekend saw a record number walk across the border from North Dakota, and, with the change of seasons, more are certain to follow. \nAlmost 50 percent of Canadians now say they should be sent back to the U.S. \nWith 29 more illegals entering Canada over the weekend, tensions continue to rise just as the Trudeau government remains adamant that doing nothing to contain the flow is good policy. \nVideo obtained by CTV News shows just how the “refugees” manage to enter the country: by walking across. Some are guided at night by a railway tracks while use an old border crossing that hasn’t been active in years. \n“We see the numbers climbing, and I don’t think that is going to slow down,” Emerson-Franklin councillor Doug Johnston told CTV Winnipeg on Monday. \nEmerson is a remote border town with barely 700 inhabitants. It’s population will soon double at the rate that illegals have been arriving since January. At least 300 have already made the trip though the federal agencies responsible for processing the illegals admit that they aren’t counting . \nManitoba Premier Brian Pallister guesses at least 1,000 could enter his province this year — though that estimate is based on current levels. He’s asked the federal Liberal government for assistance but they haven’t responded. Pallister is agitated with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s indifference, as are Canadians as Monday’s poll also indicatead. \nThe local Salvation Army says the “asylum seekers” have already cost them at least $100,000 to provide the cue-jumpers with food and clothing — in excess of what municipal authorities have already given them. \n“We’re all concerned there are more people coming,” one shelter worker told CTV News. “How are we going to house them? How are we going to accommodate them?” \nThen there are the environmental and climactic perils. Some of the illegal refugees became frostbitten when they crossed in sub-zero prairie temperatures. Now, with spring having arrived, local authorities are warning about flooding so severe that people are at a risk of drowning in the fields. \nOn Monday, the Conservative official opposition raised the illegal refugee issue in the House of Commons during Question Period. Immigration critic Michelle Rempel dismissed the inaction and apparent indifference of the Trudeau government and said it treats the crisis “like a joke.” \nConservative public safety critic Tony Clement has told The Daily Caller that he believes the crisis was precipitated by Trudeau’s now infamous Tweet that invited the refugees of the world to come to Canada because “that statement has become government policy.” \nWednesday is budget day in Canada and the Liberal government has given no indication that it will be addressing the refugee crisis with any more money or resources.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T16:26:16.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
