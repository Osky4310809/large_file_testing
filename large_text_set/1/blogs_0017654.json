Those that inhale the toxin die laughing with the same maniacal grin as The Joker etched on their faces. \nEmily Locke lands her dream job as Director of Research and Development for Wayne Security in Charm City, home to super heroes and villains and citizens fed up with the collateral damage of their constant fighting. Full of confidence and big ideas, Emily quickly learns that her aspirations far exceed those of her new boss and officemates, so it will be up to her to lead the team toward their full potential and the realization that you donâ€™t need superpowers to be a hero. \nThe cast: Vanessa Hudgens, Alan Tudyk, Danny Pudi, Christina Kirk, and Ron Funches. \nJustin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, Len Goldstein, Marc Buckland and Dean Lorey are executive producers of Powerless .
