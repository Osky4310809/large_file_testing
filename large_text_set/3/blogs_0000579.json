But inside, the copious leaded-glass windows let plenty of light in, offsetting the oak floors, box beam ceilings, paneled walls, and built-in cabinetry. \nAlong with its open-plan living/dining room, the 1,239-square-foot bungalow has three bedrooms, one bath, and a bright galley-style kitchen. Per the listing, there’s also a basement space for laundry and storage. As for the home’s exterior, in its sizable backyard, you’ll find an art studio/workshop as well as a variety of fruit-bearing trees, including plum, nectarine, pomegranate, and avocado.\nLast sold in 2002 for $195,000, it’s now asking $629,000. Open house is scheduled from 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday.\n5927 Tipton Way [Official site] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-03T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-03T01:28:05.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
