As part of her new partnership with the #AerieReal U-Day campaign , the 29-year-old actress shared this refreshingly honest post to Instagram, telling her followers she is perfectly imperfect and totally okay with it. A photo posted by Hilary Duff (@hilaryduff) on Feb 2, 2017 at 1:24pm PST \n\n\"I didn't always love my legs, but as I've grown, I've learned to love and celebrate myself, just as I am,\" she captioned a photo of herself wearing a t-shirt and underwear. \"I began to realize that my legs are STRONG and they carry me every. single. day. Our bodies are amazing and something to be grateful fo r. I'm ME and that's really enough!\" \nThe star shared a similar sentiment in our recent interview her about why she loves her shape . \"I'm short and always going to be a curvier gal, unless I just decide not to eat anymore, which is not a fun (or healthy!) option. I'm just strong. I'm cool with how I look. I have really strong legs. I'm a mom so I can toss my kid around and go hard with him all day long, and I love that,\" she said. \"Of course there are always things I wish I could change or improve, but I love my strong legs and my bum. I have a gymnast bodyâ€”I'm never going to be that super skinny girl. i just want to be strong and feel good.\" Preach. \nGrowing up as a young girl in the spotlight, Duff has been open about her body image issues and obsession with being \"thin\" as a teen . It's great to see that as a mother and an actress with a flourishing career, she has found a way to move past those thoughts and is encouraging others to do the same.
