Jim Himes (D-CT) about Obamacare and why Democrats are fighting to keep it intact. \nThroughout the conversation, Carlson kept trying to get Himes to explain why the Affordable Care Act wasn’t popular with the voting public while highlighting that it is going through a death spiral in several states, with Himes countering that portions of the law are very popular along with Medicaid and Medicare. \nAt one point, the conversation turned to young adults and the idea of the mandate, which Himes noted that Republicans and Tucker hated. \n“Young people hate the mandate,” Carlson retorted. \nThe two went back and forth for a while longer over the pros and cons of Obamacare. \nWatch the entire exchange above, via Fox News. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-05T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-05T04:56:09.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
