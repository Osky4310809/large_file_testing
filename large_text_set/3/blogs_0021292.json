You get what you’re given — so being given more is very welcome. \nCupertino launched the iPhone SE a year ago , reviving the four-inch display design it debuted on the iPhone 5, back in 2012 — throwing a bone to lovers of smaller phones. Yet not throwing in a whole lot of storage. \nIndeed, Apple has been criticized for continuing to sell a handset with just 16GB of on board storage in an age of smartphone-powered rich media sharing. And, well, it finally looks to have listened — keeping the $399 starter price for the cheapest iPhone SE but doubling the storage. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-21T17:18:02.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
