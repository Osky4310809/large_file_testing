We only go there to get something. \n\"Usually, you go to City, and you can get a point... should I already be satisfied with this? No. I’m not.

Should I start? \n“The only way to do it is focus on our own game. If the table was only the top six we would be in a better position so obviously we have not done a lot wrong against these teams.
