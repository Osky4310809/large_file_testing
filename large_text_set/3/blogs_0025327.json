It is also the prevailing weather system during the summer season. ADVERTISEMENT \nBut the northeast monsoon or the hanging amihan bringing cool winds is still expected to return on Monday, Aurelio told INQUIRER.net. The onset of the summer season may only be declared once the northeast monsoon goes away completely. \nOn Thursday, Metro Manila recorded a temperature of 35.4 degrees Celsius, but the heat index or the temperature felt by the body based on air temperature and humidity was registered at 38 degrees Celsius.
