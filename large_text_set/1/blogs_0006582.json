Were you looking forward to the season six premiere, scheduled for January 19, the last day before Trump’s inauguration? How about other ShondaLand shows, like Grey’s Anatomy or How to Get Away With Murder , both of which were also supposed to return with new episodes that night? Well, you might want to sit down for this: ABC has changed plans and will now be airing a 20/20 pre-inauguration special called America’s First Family: The Trumps Go to Washington that Thursday night instead, according to Deadline . Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal will air reruns, and How to Get Away With Murder won’t air at all. The shows will return on the night of January 26, assuming Trump makes it six full days without provoking a nuclear attack. \nShonda Rhimes, the creator of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy and executive producer of How to Get Away With Murder , is no fan of Trump: She appeared in a Hillary Clinton ad back in March with the stars of several of her shows and has made her position clear on Twitter . So far, she hasn’t commented on the situation. But maybe she’s okay with it; she has excellent instincts when it comes to great television, and The Trumps Go to Washington will undoubtedly be mesmerizing. Just take a look at the leaked footage we found online: \nMatthew Dessem is Brow Beat’s nights and weekends editor and the author of a biography of screenwriter and director Clyde Bruckman .
