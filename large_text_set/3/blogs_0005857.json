It almost seems as though there's been palpable effort to reverse the divisive perception of the studio and its films , with directors, producers, writers and stars all talking up both their own projects and creative teams - as well as each other's. \nThe Batman has been generating particular buzz in the last month, after star Ben Affelck stepped down as director. There was a bit of back and forth drama between Warner Bros. and director Matt Reeves ( War for the Planet of the Apes ), before they came to agreement and he signed on to write and produce the film. \nSince then, all sorts of famous people from both in front of and behind the cameras of the DC Extended Universe have reached out to publicly state their support of (or joy with) the selection of Reeves as the director of The Batman - and the latest is Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins, who took to Twitter with some nice words to share. \nAfter Jenkins got a tweet from film editor Vahn Gharakhani, asking if she'd had a chance to speak with Reeves since he came onboard, with the added statement that he's a really great filmmaker. In response, Jenkins said, \" He really is. I'm so excited to see his Batman, and have him in the DC universe. Great choice !\" \n@ItsTheFilmmaker @mattreevesLA He really is. I'm so excited to see his Batman, and have him in the DC universe. Great choice! â€” Patty Jenkins (@PattyJenks) March 1, 2017 \nWe've already written extensively about why Matt Reeves is a great choice to direct The Batman - and judging by fans' big 4.01/5 Anticipation Rating (Add your ranking below!) it's clear that DC fans have a lot of hope riding on this next Batman solo movie. So a good director is key.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T06:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-02T02:28:56.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
