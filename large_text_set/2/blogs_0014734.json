By Chris Tapsell Published 20/02/2017 The emperor's new Magikarp. \nAnyone remember how much it cost to buy a bicycle back in Pokémon Red? \nA shade under million quid, or Pokédollars, technically, until you were given one for free. How about that bloke who sold a Magikarp for $500-odd? Or maybe the rare, million-dollar Slowpoke Tails in Pokémon Gold and Silver? \nAnyway, the point is Pokémon has a bit of a history when it comes to completely rinsing you for random items, so it should come as no surprise that a top hat in Pokémon Go will set you back eight real-world, solid, space-and-time-occupying actual British Pounds. \nWhat does this hat do?

You can also, crucially, take off your shoes. \nIt's not all skin-deep though, as alongside the clothes and the new Pokémon, there are also plenty of new evolution items like the Up-Grade , new capture items like the Pinap and Nanab Berries , and plenty more. We're actually having quite a lot of fun diving back in, and all the better if we look damn good doing it.
