It got to a point that even the makers couldn't deal with him anymore, and he was shown the door. Once he was out - because he threw his urine on Rohan Mehra and Bani Judge inside the house BTW - we were pretty sure he would continue his antics in the real world too. \nHe has been blatantly lying about happenings inside the house, and most people who are brave enough to take his interview end up losing their minds with this man. He lies, he makes up situations, he abuses if you don't agree with him, and his favourite thing is talking about how your ' khaandaan ' sucks. \nRecently, he was invited for a debate on a news channel (don't ask us why), and as usual he was abusing people who didn't agree with him. It got to a point where his one (yes just one, thank God) follower got up, and threatened a woman who was questioning him. This, and the crap that Swami Om was saying, didn't go down well with anyone and part of the crowd, and even some members from the panel, got up and started bashing them both. \nWhile we in no way support violence, as watchers of the show we know the pathetic and horrible things that this man has been up to. So there is a part of us that is screaming ... FINALLY! \nHere, watch the video for yourself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-16T18:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-16T08:39:43.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
