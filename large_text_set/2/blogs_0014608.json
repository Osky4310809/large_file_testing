It was so special to see such a talent at such a young age. \n“He's one of the greats and he will play for me on the right. When he came into the first team, he would make fun of everyone with his football. He could do anything. One of the best players that has ever played the game.” \nWATCH: Ronaldinho's new single \nVan Bronckhorst was also fortunate enough to play alongside Brazilian legend Ronaldinho, with the pair linking up on the left flank for Barca. \nHe added of the two-time World Player of the Year: “It was amazing to play with him and the dynamic we had on the left side was one of the best I felt.” \nXavi, Andres Iniesta and Carles Puyol also made the cut, along with Arsenal team-mates Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieria. \nOn his iconic fellow Dutchman, he said: “He is a legend, not only for Dutch football but also as one of the biggest stars that played in the Premier League. \nMessi left in limbo by Barcelona \n“When I came to Arsenal he really helped me to get settled in London. His skills were amazing, and he was the same as Messi and Ronaldinho in that you never knew what Dennis was going to do.” \nEdwin van der Sar, Ronald Koeman and Jaap Stam completed Van Bronckhorst’s XI, with a role found for himself at left-back.
