Trivia In recent patches the stones were made static: they can no longer be knocked off somewhere inaccessible when using explosive magic or walking over them. They cannot even be moved while pressing the interaction button. It is also possible to get the gem via the console command tcl . There is a way to get multiple gems from only one. Tap the interact button as fast as possible while targeting the stone. If done correctly, multiple stones may be picked up instead of one. Slow Time is a sure way to make use of the exploit. Any stones left over after finishing the quest will still be in their original locations. If picked up and dropped, they will hover in mid air, immobile. They may be picked up again, and can be stored or sold. Until the stones are appraised by Vex, they stack. After the quest begins, each new stone will take a new inventory line. The Stones have a marked value of 200 , but stealing one while on a Bedlam job for a hold in which it is located will satisfy the conditions of the Bedlam quest. i.e. It will count as being worth 500 or more. Bugs \nThis section contains bugs related to Stones of Barenziah. Before adding a bug to this list, consider the following: Please reload an old save to confirm if the bug is still happening. If the bug is still occurring, please post the bug report with the appropriate system template 360 / XB1 , PS3 / PS4 , PC / MAC , depending on which platform(s) the bug has been encountered on. Be descriptive when listing the bug and fixes, but avoid having conversations in the description and/or using first-person-anecdotes: such discussions belong on the appropriate forum board . Click to show PC If the Stone of Barenziah in Reeking Cave cannot be found beside the dead mage after applying Patch 1.4, a glitch will need to be utilized to reenter the Thalmor Embassy and pick it up from its original location. This bug has been found in all versions of the game. PC(Fix) Using the console command to unlock the front door to the Embassy will work to get back in. The gem may not appear on the counter where it is supposed to sit in Fellglow Keep. The stone in Wuunferth the Unliving's quarters may not be there after the quest Blood on the Ice. PC 360 PS3 Periodically, some stones may respawn at their initial place, such as the one in Jarl Elisif the Fair's quarters. PC If these stones are collected, they will not longer count as quest items and can be dropped or sold. 360 In Calixto's House of Curiosities , it may be possible to obtain a stone at Calixto's museum on one of the shelves if every other location has been exhausted without obtaining all twenty-four. PC Entering the Dwemer Museum after having completed Hard Answers will initiate that quest again. PC(Fix) To move the stone to the Dragonborn's location without entering the museum, use the console command prid 7F909 followed by moveto player . Alternatively, complete the \"Hard Answers\" quest again to get another Nightingale Blade . Subsequent Thieves Guild quests will not start again. Darkness Returns cannot be finished if Hard Answers is completed twice before it has. PC 360 PS3 Maul's dialogue may not show up, but the quest can still be started with Vex. 360 PS3 If all the gemstones are collected prior to their appraisal, the entire collection may be stuck in the inventory while a bug bars the quest from being completed. PC Occasionally, Stones of Barenziah may not stack properly. This results in multiple stacks being formed of the same item. Sometimes when a Stone of Barenziah is taken, it is counted as stealing even though it is labeled take. If Vex is spoken to before Maul, then Maul is talked to after the quest has started, a miscellaneous objective to become a full member of the thieves guild appears. Because the Dragonborn had to be a full member to get it appraised they cannot complete the objective. If the Dragonborn chose the quest \" Destroy the Dark Brotherhood! ,\" they may not be allowed to go back in after it has been completed.
