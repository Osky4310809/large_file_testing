ADVERTISEMENT \n“We give every parish the freedom to plan and organize its commemoration with simplicity but depth. What is important is the space offered for a religious experience that could transform our parishioners on the ground,” Tagle said in the circular. \nAt least four Masses and a procession will be held at the Edsa Shrine on Friday, February 24 to commemorate the 1986 Edsa People Power revolution. \nThere is no word yet if Tagle or the other prelates will be joining the celebration of the peaceful revolution that toppled the 20-year rule of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos. \nIn his circular, the Manila archbishop gave the members of the clergy the freedom to choose the time of day or evening to conduct the simple commemoration of the historic event. \nTagle noted that for those in the Catholic Church, the peaceful revolution if 1986 “was an event of people relying on their faith for social transformation.” \nHe added that “in full view of the world, the Filipino people showed the power of prayer that begets courage that begets solidarity that begets change.” \n“Thirty-one years later, we thank God for the gift of faith, as we also ask pardon for our personal and communal failure in consistently living that faith in justice, love and peace,” Tagle said.
