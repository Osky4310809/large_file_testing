Angela Merkel's EU Army Poses the Greatest Threat to World Peace in 2017 by William Craddick - Jan 18, 2017 4:25 PM \nAn aggressive campaign to militarize the EU combined with a rise in strong anti-American rhetoric from Angela Merkel raise questions about the true purpose of the EU Army. Here's How Google Tracks You (And What You Can Do About It) Jan 19, 2017 2:45 AM 0 SHARES \nEver get the feeling you’re being watched? \nIt’s because you are – and, as Visual Capitalist's Jeff Desjardins details , for a rough proxy of this, use the browser extension Ghostery to see how many tracking scripts are watching you on a typical media site. (It doesn’t work for everything, but a large media site like Vice.com has 50+ trackers, with 40 of them focused on advertising). \nCapturing this user data helps sites sell their inventory to advertisers, but a select few companies operate in this capacity at a whole different level. Google and Facebook are the best of examples of this, as nearly $0.60 of every dollar spent on digital advertising goes to them. They both have the sophistication and ubiquity to capture incredible amounts of information about you. \nGOOGLE IS EVERYWHERE Courtesy of: Visual Capitalist \nThe search giant is massive in size, and there is a good chance you tap into Googleverse in some way: \nGlobal market penetration for Android is 61-81%. \nGoogle has a 78.8% market share for online search. \nThe company generates $67.4 billion in annual ad revenue. \nGoogle processes two trillion searches annually. \n30-50 million websites use Google Analytics to for tracking. \nThere are 700,000 apps available in the Google Play store. \n82% of videos watched online come from YouTube. \nIn total, Google has at least 79 products and services. \nAccording to Google’s documentation, it uses these services to pull out information on the “things you do”, “things you create”, and the things that make you unique. \nSEE WHAT GOOGLE COLLECTS \nAll in all, Google tracks your activity history, location history, audio history, and device history. It also builds a profile for you for serving ads – age, gender, location, income, and other demographic data. \nYou can view and actually download this history by using a tool called Google Takeout . \nMany people understand that their data helps support advertising revenues on websites they enjoy. Others are rightly concerned about their privacy, and how their information is used. Regardless of which category you fit in, becoming informed about how privacy on the internet works will help you craft an experience that best fits your preferences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-19T14:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-19T09:59:41.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
