Another man also died on Saturday in Belgium when his truck slid off a road, while sub-zero temperatures in Italy are thought to have claimed the lives of six homeless people. \nHeavy snow and high winds resulted in re-routed flights, delayed ferries, cancelled trains and closed roads in Italy. \nWith no indications of a let-up, some schools in the country's south were ordered to close on Monday because a metre of snow had already buried some areas, the ANSA news agency reported. \nA dog sleeps in snowy Istanbul (AFP/Getty Images) \nIn Rome, fountains in St Peter's Square froze overnight and were draped in icicles. \nTemperatures dropped to -7C in Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki, and -10C was expected on Sunday, according to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. \nSeveral Greek islands, otherwise known for their sunny and warm weather, were blanketed in snow.
