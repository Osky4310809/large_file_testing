By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: March 5, 2017 11:40 AM “I wonder what revenue neutral rate it would be, if we will put every thing in zero or low rates. Do we have to make profit at the cost of the nation?,” said Piyush Goyal. (Reuters) \nUnion Power Minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s seven kilometre stretch from Banaras Hindu University to Kashi Vishwanath Temple was “not a road-show”. The union minister added that PM started a usual journey between the two destination, however, a sea of crowd gathered around his cavalcade. “Kal roadshow tha hi nhi, PM Kashi, Kal Bhairav mandir ki darshan ke liye aaye thay, raaste mein jansailaab unke saath jud gya,” Piyush Goyal said. “Anumati kal bhi thi, darshan ke liye puray road ki anumati thi, kal ke utsah ko dekh ke aajka roadhshow nirdharit kar diya hai,” Goyal added. \nBJP leader’s statement came in reply of a complaint filed by Congress on Saturday against Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for carrying out a rally in poll-bound Varanasi without the due approval of concerned authorities. In a letter addressed to Chief Election Comissioner Nasim Zaidi, and Comissioners OP Rawat and AK Jyoti, Congress alleged that PM Modi conducted a road show between Bharat Hindu University to a destination about seven kilometeres far from the starting point. BSP Candidate Bazmi Siddiqui Cries Foul Over Rape Allegations \nThe letter further stated that the road show covered at least three constituency. “It is requested that action may be taken and FIR registered against all BJP leaders including Narendra Modi who were part of the road show,” said K C Mittal, AICC secretary incharge of legal and human rights cell. The opposition party said the entire video recording of the road show was aired at various channels and election authorities must also have recorded the same.
