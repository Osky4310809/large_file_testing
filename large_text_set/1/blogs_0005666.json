The actress attended Thursday’s Golden Globes at W Magazine ’s Best Performances Portfolio party and looked like a mini Audrey Hepburn. Millie rocked a Kate Spade sequined fringe-sleeved LBD (little black dress) that made us want to shimmy throughout the night.\nJust imagine how fun this dress is to dance in ! This Kate Spade masterpiece is like 1920’s flapper meets 1960’s classy fashionista. Millie kept her accessories to a minimum to let her glittering fringe sleeves do the talking.\nGetty Images / Donato Sardella To make everything even better, this dress is currently on sale for $279 . Don’t you love it when stars wear affordable fashion?\nMillie paired the look with Kate Spade’s Marcellina heels ($328) . The shoes’ gold glitter heels match Millie’s gold accessories and compliment the sparkle in the dress’ sleeves. Getty Images / owcelebritytv/Bauer-Griffin We’re sure you’re well aware by now that fringe is in. Fringed leather jackets are everywhere. Fringed purses complete any boho look. Some fashion-lovers are even fringing the hems of their jeans to add a little pizazz to their everyday wardrobe. If you’re as inspired by Millie’s dress to wear fringed formalwear as we are, we have some affordable options to try this trend without breaking the bank.\n\nThis blush pink ASOS number ($37.50) would look amazing with a pair of nude or metallic heels and some simple jewelry. ASOS We also love how this dress also includes the cape trend by way of the “flutter sleeves.” The one word we can think of to perfectly describe this look is flouncy. \nOr check out the ASOS Night Top ($40.50) . Similar to Millie’s Kate Spade dress, the fringe is focused at the sleeve and is accentuated with beads, rather than sequins. ASOS Pair this top with a flattering pair of high-waisted trousers or perhaps a high-waisted long skirt, and you’re ready to arrive to your cocktail party in ultimate style.\nFringe can be a lot more than just a quirky detail at the bottom of your fave summer t-shirt. Whether you dress it up or dress it down, a great piece of fringed clothing can make you stand out in any crowd.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-07T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-07T04:15:11.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
