But this policy will almost certainly not last the year — if it lasts at all. And if he's smart, this way of running the government won't last long either. \nThe refugees ban is a textbook example of how not to make policy. Its genesis exacerbated tension between him and congressional Republicans. It emboldened a visible and attention-getting opposition. It alienated his own Cabinet secretaries . Now he’s staring down the first defeat of his short presidency, and it isn’t because American values triumphed or because protesters forced him to back down. \nIt’s because he rushed through an executive order without consulting the people he needs to make it work. His team didn’t tell the State Department which countries would subject to the visa restrictions, The Wall Street Journal reports. The New York Times found Department of Homeland Security aides eager to dish dirt on how the new secretary, John Kelly, learned about the executive order from watching Trump sign it on television. We don’t know if lawyers at the DHS, or the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol , got a chance to vet the language. (Trump’s team is vague about this.) The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel got little if any chance to judge its consistency with other laws and directives. \nIts slapdash language reads more like a policy screed than an official order. It bungled the treatment of permanent residents, or green card holders. And its history as a public policy is replete with comments attesting to its discriminatory motives. (Rudy Giuliani bragged about how then-candidate Trump asked him how to “show me the right way to do it legally” after calling it a “Muslim ban.” You can bet these words will be near the top of every filing the ACLU sends to federal courts.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:40:19.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
