The deal is valid from today and is currently available on the following models under Wish series: it1409, it1407, it1508, it1508+ and Power Pro series it1516+. This is a big move by Idea but also targeting the smartphone market, especially since rumours have surfaced that Reliance Jio could be partnering with Google to bring affordable smartphones in the pockets of Indian users. Idea also ventured into another segment where it has now made roaming calls across India free. \nIf you want to avail the free 6GB data offer, you need to go to http://i4all.ideacellular.com/offers from your itel smartphones using an Idea SIM and click on ‘Let’s Get Started’ button on the main page. The portal will automatically register your phone number and the IMEI of your itel phone. You will then have to click on ‘Show My Offers’ and choose ‘itel 1GB’ offer so that you receive the activation message and then start surfing the web for free. The data offered under the plan will be completely free during the initial month. Following this, users will have to do a monthly recharge of Rs 50 or above for any voice or data pack, in order to continue to avail the 1GB free data per month for up to six months. \nAlso see: \nSudhir Kumar, CEO, itel Mobile, on the new partnership, said, “With all aspects of our lives rapidly migrating onto a digital platform, internet connectivity has become a necessity instead of a luxury. The association with Idea Cellular, one of the most popular mobile networks with an extensive service outreach, is aimed at making digital connectivity more affordable and value-driven for both itel and Idea users.” He added, “We are confident that a large number of consumers across the country will benefit from the partnership and the enhanced digital connectivity that it enables.” \nAlso read | Airtel takes on Reliance Jio: ‘Surprise’ offer to give 30GB of free data; here’s how to avail \nIdea, recently decided to make all roaming calls in India free, after Bharti Airtel , India’s leading network provider announced the removal of all roaming charges for outgoing and incoming calls as well as SMSes and data usage in India.
