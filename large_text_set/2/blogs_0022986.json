The opening date was earlier than we thought, and it’s now open in downtown Detroit. The Bonobos guideshop is a little different than other clothing stores. They call it a \"clicks to bricks\" retail concept. Starting as an online retailer, the company has opened many shops around the country after their online success. The shops give a range of styles and sizes for customers to try on, and guests order what they’d like to purchase, which is then delivered to them. The Detroit store at 1417 Woodward Avenue is 1,700 square feet and designed with white oak, hickory and black steel fixtures with an all glass storefront. Sachse Construction was the general contractor on the project and Kraemer Design Group was the architect of record. It joins many businesses who have opened along this stretch of Woodward this past year, including Nike, Kit and Ace, Warby Parker, and Detroit is the New Black. A two-story Under Armour will open on Woodwdard later this spring. Bonobos is open Monday–Wednesday 11am-7pm, Thursday-Saturday 11am-8pm, and Sunday 12pm-6pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:35:51.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
